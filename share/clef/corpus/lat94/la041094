RIGHT FOR THE JUGULAR; HERE'S A HEART-THUMPING, STAY-UP-LATE NOVEL THAT'S WORTH 
ITS HYPE.; THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW: A NOVEL, BY ALLAN FOLSOM (LITTLE, BROWN & 
CO.: $24.95; 608 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 When The Times called and asked me to review this novel I was wary, because I 
doubted that the book itself could live up to the fantastic hype surrounding 
its sale. If the name Allan Folsom doesn't ring a bell, his story probably 
will. About a year and half ago there were a lot of items in every paper about 
Folsom, a failed screenwriter, who had toiled in the Hollywood coal mines for 
years and years with only a couple of episodes of some long forgotten TV show 
to his credit. But unlike so many writers you meet in this lovely little snake 
pit, Folsom was not sitting home days waiting for the phone to ring while he 
watched Geraldo/Oprah/Montel salivate over "Fathers Who Lust After Their 
Daughters' Pets." No, the man was actually doing what so many failed and or 
frustrated screen scribes threaten but never get around to -- writing a big, 
ambitious thriller. After 10 years of what must have been backbreaking work, he 
sent the finished book to a literary agent Aaron Priest in New York. Priest 
read it, went into shock, sent it out to several publishers with a 48-hour 
deadline and, boom, Allan Folsom no longer had to worry if the dog in his spec 
script was likable enough. He had made a $2-million book sale to Little, Brown. 
On top of which he sold the world rights for tons more money and got another 
cool mil from producer Richard Zanuck for the movie rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a story of such high drama, I worried that my own reaction to the novel 
might be a bit jaded. I mean, how could any author top such a tale in mere 
fiction? It would take something twisted, wild, ambitious, unputdownable and 
outrageous simply to compete with his own hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, I'm here to report that "The Day After Tomorrow" is all these things 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me add one caveat: If you are the kind of thriller reader who exclusively 
digs, say, the more cerebral, subtle, arcane kind of thriller writer, like John 
le Carre, don't shell out the 25 bucks. This ain't for you. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you flipped for over-the-top, wildly imaginative, hideously violent, 
weirdo thrillers like say, "The First Deadly Sin," "Perfume" (although it's not 
quite in that class in craft), "Shibumi," "The Exorcist," "The Manchurian 
Candidate," "The Shining" or "The Day of the Jackal," then this is just the 
book for you. If these titles are confusing I picked them for two reasons: (1) 
They are the most non-stoppable thrillers I've ever read, and "The Day After 
Tomorrow" is every bit their equal, and (2) some of them are political 
thrillers and some of them are horror tales and "The Day After Tomorrow" is 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that's Folsom's particular brilliance. He has wed the novel of revenge 
with the political thriller and grafted the whole thing seamlessly onto a 
brilliant updating of the Frankenstein story. Oh, yeah, lest I forget the love 
story in the book works too. 
</P>
<P>
 The action begins at once. While having a love affair in Paris, an American 
orthopedic surgeon named Paul Osborn accidentally runs into the man who killed 
his father in Boston when Paul was only 10 years old. Enraged and in shock, 
Osborn attacks the man in a Paris bistro. Waiters pull Osborn off, the man runs 
and Osborn chases him, only to lose him in the Metro. But Osborn has been 
haunted for too long to give up. He hires a private detective to track the 
killer down. His desire is to kill the man, of course, but before doing so to 
ask him why in God's name he committed the murder. The private detective finds 
the man easily, but nothing else is easy after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Osborn is thrown into a whirlpool of events, both historical and surgical 
(the absolute creepiest part of the book), which far outweigh his own personal 
revenge. Thrown into this maelstrom with Osborn is an L.A. cop named William 
McVey, and a beautiful and resourceful young woman named Vera Monneray. Their 
opponents are every bit their match; they include the assassin Henri Janarack, 
another assassin known as the Tall Man, the trained terrorist Von Holden and 
the true king of the creeps, Erwin Scholl. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it's all over Paul Osborn meets terror that is both human and 
high-tech, and there's not a dull moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that's one problem with the book. Not that there should be dull spots, 
but by the second half of the book the action is so furious and the bodies pile 
up so high that we are pretty much drenched in blood. If there's evidence that 
Folsom is a first-time novelist, this is it. He might have trusted in his 
characters more and left a few of the train wrecks and charred bodies to Robert 
Ludlum. Indeed, I have no doubt that some readers will be seriously put off by 
the body count, and some of the more graphic descriptions of wounds, 
decapitation, etc. (To tell you the truth, I'm never bothered by this kind of 
thing, and some of the latter moves even got to me.) 
</P>
<P>
 There's one more serious problem. Folsom tries to save the last thrill for the 
last sentence, but I figured that one out about halfway through the book. And I 
think you will too. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the suspense is almost always unbearable, the story hugely 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me put it this way: I started "The Day After Tomorrow" yesterday at 2 in 
the afternoon, and finished reading it, my eyes bleeding, at 3 a.m. I'm writing 
this at noon, and I need a serious nap. "The Day After Tomorrow" ain't 
"Middlemarch," folks, but I defy you to put it down.

A MAGIC CARPET RIDE; THE GREAT LOS ANGELES SWINDLE: OIL, STOCKS AND SCANDAL 
DURING THE ROARING TWENTIES, BY JULES TYGIEL (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $25, 398 
PP.; ILLUSTRATED)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Greg Mitchell, Greg Mitchell is the author of The Campaign of the Century: 
Upton Sinclair's Race for Governor of California and the Birth of Media 
Politics. He is writing a book about the Nixon-Douglas race for the U.S. Senate 
in 1950. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles worshiped citrus and bowed down to the automobile but in the 1920s 
it was "oil, oil, oil" that made "L.A. boil," as the official drinking song of 
a prominent booster club put it. Oil started gushing at Huntington Beach in 
1920, and at Signal Hill and Santa Fe Springs a year later, enriching tycoon 
and tiny property owner alike. No wonder the population of Los Angeles would 
more than double in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have pictured the Los Angeles of this period as a kind of Oildorado. 
Others, such as Kevin Starr, call it Oz, an ordinary place "touched by magic" 
for those wearing emerald-tinted glasses. Carey McWilliams took a darker view, 
choosing as his L.A. metaphor the "mushroom": bright and attractive on the 
surface, but with a dark and ugly nether side. 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Tygiel's "The Great Los Angeles Swindle" somehow validates all three of 
these visions. It's a cautionary tale of oil promoters, dream weavers and bunco 
artists breeding civic and corporate corruption. But mainly it's the story of 
C. C. Julian, a flamboyant oil huckster who was part dreamer, part dream 
merchant. What has become known as the Julian Petroleum Scandal has never 
received a full-length study until now, and Tygiel, author of "Baseball's Great 
Experiment," an excellent biography of Jackie Robinson, gets it right (despite 
some serious flaws). 
</P>
<P>
 Courtenay Chauncey Julian, a Canadian who had worked in Texas as a rigger, 
arrived in Los Angeles around 1920 at the height of boosterism. Los Angeles was 
being sold as a commodity, and hundreds of thousands from out of state were 
buying it. Florida had its land boom, Oklahoma and Texas their oil booms, but 
in California everything seemed to explode at once, feeding the ballyhoo 
spirit. Many of the new arrivals -- Midwestern farmers, retired businessmen, 
get-rich quick adventurers -- were eager to invest in almost anything. This 
made L.A. ripe for what journalist Guy Finney called "heedless financial 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 When George Getty struck it rich at Santa Fe Springs in early 1922, C. C. 
Julian decided to become an oil magnate himself. There was only one hang-up: He 
didn't have any money. In Los Angeles in the 1920s this wasn't necessarily a 
problem. It could even be a solution! Julian borrowed from friends to buy some 
land and then went to "the folks" (as American historian Louis Adamic called 
them) to raise the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Other promoters lured investors through the mail, or by passing out circulars, 
or chartering busses that took sightseers from Pershing Square right out to the 
oil fields for a look around. Borrowing a page from evangelists, they set up 
circus tents and welcomed the suckers inside. 
</P>
<P>
 But C. C. Julian did things differently. Advertising was just coming into 
vogue, and Julian recognized that he could reach more investors that way -- in 
his own voice. And what a voice! In his daily ads in the Los Angeles Times (and 
later, on radio) the nattily dressed gentleman who drove a Pierce-Arrow 
addressed "the folks" on their own level, "just as if I was talking to them," 
he later explained. His most successful ad declared: "Widows and Orphans, This 
Is No Investment for You! . . . My appeal is addressed to people who can 
legitimately afford to take a chance. . . ." In a matter of days over 175,000 
arrived at his door. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was only beginning. "You'll never make a thin dime just lookin' on," he 
preached. Julian appealed to his investors' gambling instincts, picturing 
himself as a race horse they should bet on. He begged them to "walk in and 
shoot me" if he ever betrayed their confidence -- and may "buzzards pick my 
bones and the wind whistle 'Star-Spangled Banner' through my ribs." 
</P>
<P>
 Within five months, Julian had raked in close to a million dollars, and his 
two wells were pumping 3,500 barrels of oil a day. By the spring of 1923 many 
of his 40,000 backers were earning dividends and he had solicited another cool 
million. He incorporated Julian Petroleum and opened a chain of gas stations. 
This made him "the prince of oil promoters," Tygiel observes, and his newspaper 
ads "had become a Southern California institution." 
</P>
<P>
 By this point, however, Julian was spending most of his time trying to keep 
one step ahead of prosecutors, who suspected that he was cooking his books and 
watering his stocks. Withing a few weeks in early 1924 the L.A. Times stopped 
accepting his ads; Charlie Chaplin decked him with a punch at Cafe Petroushka; 
and he had to dodge three bullets fired at his Los Feliz mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 As one critic put it, Julian had done "all the extracting, but never put in 
the promised gold bridgework." With his oil operations a shambles and a federal 
indictment pending, Julian got out while the getting was good, selling his 
interests to a man named Sheridan C. Lewis for half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 While Julian had been a lone wolf, Lewis invited the rich and powerful to join 
him in a swindle of outrageous proportions. Such luminaries as film magnate 
Louis B. Mayer, banker Henry Robinson and industrialist Harry Haldeman played 
small roles in the conspiracy. Over-is sued stock poured out "like sausage 
coming out of the mill," as one observer put it. The fraud would exceed $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and his associates were finally indicted and brought to trial but 
declared innocent. Soon it was learned that three jurors had taken bribes and 
that Dist. Atty. Asa Keyes had been paid tens of thousands of dollars to throw 
the case. (Lewis, Keyes and half a dozen others eventually went to prison for 
various crimes, but no one was ever punished for the Julian swindle itself.) 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market crash in October, 1929, "would douse the speculative fires 
that had raged throughout the 1920s," Tygiel observes, but the Julian case 
continued to reverberate. Henry Robinson's bank was forced to merge with a 
rival; an assassin, angry about losing his life savings, shot and killed 
millionaire Motley Flint; and the Julian fiasco became an issue in the 1930 
California governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who started it all, C. C. Julian, went bankrupt and, after being 
indicted for mail fraud, fled to Shanghai. One evening in 1934 he treated 
himself and a woman guest to a lavish champagne supper, returned to his hotel 
room, took poison and died. All he left was an autobiographical manuscript 
entitled "What Price Fugitive?" which actor George Hamilton later purchased and 
(according to Tygiel) is still trying to turn into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the delicious dirt and sleaze -- what Tygiel calls "the speculative 
debauch" -- associated with the Julian scandal can be found in "The Great Los 
Angeles Swindle." Unfortunately, there's a whole lot more. To get from one 
shocking revelation to another you have to wade through many pages of deals 
made and unmade, stock prices rising and falling and rising again; there are 
even a few charts to contend with. (In fairness, readers fascinated with high 
finance may appreciate the details more than I did.) Regulators repeatedly 
close in on C. C. Julian, then retreat, and the narrative is nearly back where 
it started. And when Julian exits center stage halfway through the story, his 
sense of humor is badly missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Tygiel cities Carey McWilliams as his inspiration, but at the end of 
the book, in a very brief analysis section, he takes issue with the great 
California journalist on a central point. Tygiel views the Julian scandal as 
"not so much the story of a city or a region as it is the saga of an era." 
McWilliams, on the other hand, felt that the Julian scandal could have happened 
only in Los Angeles, where the unique combination of mass migration, easy money 
and a gambling spirit "bred a reckless social irresponsibility." Tygiel doesn't 
care to argue the point, so neither will I, except to say that in this book the 
author himself provides much evidence that supports McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "The Great Los Angeles Swindle" fills an important gap in California 
history. More than 60 years ago a Los Angeles journal declared: "Brave is he 
who would attempt to write the true story of the notorious Julian Petroleum 
overissue fiasco." Jules Tygiel, who writes with unusual clarity, deserves 
credit for finally putting all the pieces together, while relating a tale that 
is, to borrow a phrase from C. C. Julian, "finer than the fuzz on a frog's 
face."

INTERVIEW; HE REALLY CAN'T HELP HIMSELF; SHOCKINGLY ECCENTRIC WRITER-DIRECTOR 
JOHN WATERS OFFERS YET ANOTHER LOOK AT THE GRUESOME WITH HIS NEW FILM, 'SERIAL 
MOM.' IT STACKS UP NICELY AGAINST HIS CULT FAVES 'PINK FLAMINGOS' AND 'MONDO 
TRASHO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, James Grant is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles and is

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Waters, the eccentric and ascerbic writer-director, stands in a 
claustrophobic little guest room upstairs in his sprawling Baltimore mansion, 
giving a tour and offering impromptu tips on being a sterling host. 
</P>
<P>
 He looks on pointedly as a reporter picks up a book from the night stand 
titled "How to Care for Your Gerbil." "This gets them every time," he snickers. 
"My guests start to get a little nervous once they get a look at this in their 
bedroom."  
</P>
<P>
 You were expecting cookies and milk from the man who has been dubbed 
Hollywood's Rapscallion of Repulsion? 
</P>
<P>
 Waters is back, basking in Hollywood camp and bad taste in his latest film, 
"Serial Mom," set to open Friday. It stars Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston and 
Suzanne Somers in the story of a suburban mom who is a cheerfully psychotic 
cross between June Cleaver and Ted Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serial Mom" marks the 12th film for Waters, 47, who first came to prominence 
after his 1972 film, "Pink Flamingos," achieved impressive worldwide grosses in 
more ways than one. Waters has since served up such bad-taste classics as 
"Mondo Trasho" and "Polyester." His two most recent forays, "Hairspray" and 
"Cry-Baby," have attempted to take his humor more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters fields the tough questions with aplomb; it's the niggling details that 
stump him. "What kind of trees are those in your back yard?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. Say they're green," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who designed your clothes?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Say I wore green tennis shoes and a blue shirt." In other words, he doesn't 
sweat the small stuff.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: In "Serial Mom," Kathleen Turner plays a mother with sociopathic 
tendencies, often expressed in revenge for slights against her family. What 
fascinates you about psychotic behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I wish my own mother had done that, basically. But I think everybody 
wishes that their moms would come to the rescue. "Serial Mom" is a good mom. I 
don't think of her at all as a villain of this movie. She's the heroine. She 
sticks up for her kids, who may happen to have an interest in gore movies, but 
so what? She wants her daughter to be happy. She's a liberal, good mom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With just a few bad habits . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, she means well. She doesn't kill out of meanness. She does it out of 
really caring for her family. And once she did it, it agreed with her. It was 
like a new set of pearls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are equating her penchant for killing to acquiring a new set of pearls? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, she does it stylishly. She leaves a signature every time. In one 
scene, she picks up a knife and then says to herself: "Oh, everyone does it 
with a knife." There are no guns in this movie. It's a gun-control movie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tell me about your childhood. You were educated partially by nuns, weren't 
you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The Daughters of Purgatory. I look back on them and think that they 
were the first witches I ever met in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But not the last. 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. The evilest, though. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you know that you had an early fascination with the macabre? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Whatever I seemed interested in, my parents went: 'Oh, kid, no!' I just 
knew that it was better to keep my interests to myself. I'd be playing in the 
baseball game, and I wouldn't be paying any attention; the ball would be at my 
feet, and people would be running around bases while I would talk to someone 
about Dagmar! She was the first buxom, kind of sexy TV comedienne. I liked her 
a lot when I was a kid, but I realized that maybe that wasn't right. I couldn't 
tell the teacher when they were talking about sports and stuff that I liked 
Dagmar. So I learned to have secret interests. Now almost everything I'm 
interested in I use for my work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has your notoriety changed your life? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, fame is protection if you go to a scary place. Fame is fun. A lot of 
people don't say anything and you don't know they know who you are. But then 
later they say something that makes me realize that it's a good thing I was on 
good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But at that moment, don't you wonder if you really were on good behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah. But I figure, so what if I wasn't? It's not like I make Disney 
movies. It's not like I've got a morals clause in my contract with Savoy. I had 
one with "Polyester." New Line had just never taken it out from the standard 
thing. So I called New Line, because it said that I couldn't make a movie that 
would offend the community. I said: "Are you kidding? That's what you pay me to 
do!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What led you to cast Turner as the psycho mom? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When this film was with other studios, we did not have the budget to hire 
Kathleen. But when we did, she was my No. 1 choice, believe me. She's 
delightfully wicked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I only met her once, and she had the firmest handshake in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, she's a physical woman. She does her stunts a lot. Kathleen is not 
one to shrink away from doing anything. She had to duck with knives being 
thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're known for your eclectic casting. Who else would you like to work 
with? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'd like Sharon Stone. Meryl Streep. Really the big wheels. I'd work with 
Johnny Depp again in a minute. I think "Cry-Baby" probably reached the zenith 
in terms of casting with Joey Heatherton, Iggy Pop and Patty Hearst.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would you ever consider directing a film from another writer's script or 
conception? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have no interest in ever making a movie I didn't write. If they were 
going to take my house away, then I guess I might have to. But my agent knows 
not to even bother sending me the scripts. The fun of it is thinking it up. 
Then, when I direct it, I've been living with these people for a long time in 
my head, so I get to bring them out on the screen.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I watched "Pink Flamingos" the other night. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, I haven't seen that one for 10 years. It still delivers. It still gets 
arrested in places! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you surprised that after all this time, the film still holds up in the 
shock department? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah. I'm proud of it. It's like having a serial killer movie. It still 
works. It still gets threatened with film jail. But on video, it has problems. 
Where are you going to put it? If you put it in the X-rated, people don't want 
to find it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You'll be happy to know that you have your own section in West Hollywood 
video stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Laughter.) That's great. Well, West Hollywood ain't Omaha, believe me! It 
doesn't get busted in West Hollywood. It gets stolen in West Hollywood! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has filmmaking changed for you from those early days? Obviously, the 
budgets have changed, but has your actual approach? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's exactly the same in some ways in that I'm very serious about making my 
comedies. Hollywood, at least, knows about me by now. I come in on budget. I 
make the exact movie I tell 'em I'm gonna make. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have a reputation for being quite meticulous, and although your films 
look somewhat improvisational, you don't like your actors to ad-lib. 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, we don't ever ad-lib much. But we do have rehearsal. We rehearsed 
"Serial Mom" right here in this living room. Kathleen, Sam (Waterston) -- all 
of them. That is where I see that perhaps the lines I've written don't work and 
if Kathleen or Sam had an idea, I'd listen and change it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the budget on "Pink Flamingos"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: $10,000. I thought I had a lot to work with. I had $5,000 with "Multiple 
Maniacs." It's been 30 years since 1964's "Hag in a Black Leather Jacket," 
which really cost no money because the leading lady stole the film.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: She actually stole the film? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah. And the developing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You once said Laundromats have the best lighting. Is that still true for 
you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. That was when we had no money for lights. I actually hate fluorescent 
lighting -- but you know, the coolest bars in Berlin have that on purpose only 
because the people there are so young and cute that they want it to be bright. 
It keeps old people out. What do they care? They look great and they're 18. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some critics have carped that now you're mainstream and that you've lost 
your edge. 
</P>
<P>
 A: They say that every time. They said that with "Female Trouble" -- 
everything after "Pink Flamingos." That's the only thing that sometimes makes 
me . . . that is a little unfair, and that's when they go back and say: "Oh, 
this one doesn't have the rawness and energy of 'Pink Flamingos.' " And I 
remember: They hated "Pink Flamingos." I have the clippings!  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not trying to be as raw. Definitely I'm trying to make a hit Hollywood 
movie. I have unapologetically been trying to make a Hollywood movie. I have 
unapologetically been trying to make a Hollywood hit movie with the last three 
movies. One was ("Hairspray"); one wasn't ("Cry-Baby"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is having a hit film so important?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's the only challenge I have left. They don't have cult movies anymore. 
There's no such thing as midnight movies. It would be foolish to try to make a 
cult movie -- where would it play? What movie has caused a sensation on video, 
except "Faces of Death"? Hollywood makes all kinds of movies now. Only in the 
last five or six years has it been possible for me to make Hollywood movies. I 
never even asked before. I made independent movies. It's the same strain and 
the same trouble as before, only you make more money. I don't know how to do 
anything else. I don't know any other job that I could really get. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Well, what would you do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I could work in a bookstore again. I was good at that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What sort of bookstore? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, a good one. A very good one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anyone that you would not cast in your movies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, there are people that I wouldn't have bad taste-wise. I wouldn't put 
Heidi Fleiss in one of my movies. I wouldn't put Zsa Zsa Gabor in one of my 
movies. There are people who are bad, bad taste who aren't witty or funny. I 
only put people I really respect in my movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who's turned you down? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Stockard Channing for "Hairspray." And who's the one who wears the dirty 
makeup? Mamie Van Doren. She said that she deserved better than Divine. And 
Lisa Marie Presley. I have her book upstairs, called "My Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That's not her book. It's unauthorized. She'd never write a book about 
Elvis. Not in a million years. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I'm sure she didn't write it. I'm a fan of hers. She looks like the 
prettiest girl in Baltimore ( grins widely ) .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After 12 movies set here, would you ever make a movie anyplace else? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it would be asking for bad luck. Certainly many of the people I 
work with behind the scenes live here. I filmed parts of the re-shoots for 
"Cry-Baby" in L.A.; it's not as if I would have a nervous breakdown if I had to 
do it. The amusement park in "Hairspray" was in Pennsylvania.  
</P>
<P>
 But it would be difficult for me to write a movie somewhere else. That's why I 
need to be here. I need to be cut off from things. It's also great to be able 
to drive around and spy on people, which I do when I'm writing. You'd be 
surprised. People tell me the most personal things about their lives for no 
reason -- on airplanes, everywhere I go. People just blurt out secrets. I'm not 
sure why. I think that they see in my films that nothing will make me uptight. 
I'm not going to judge them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Now that it's wrapped, how do you feel about "Serial Mom"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's my best movie, actually. But you can't tell that until a 
couple years after. Certainly if I drop dead tomorrow, my obituary in the Los 
Angeles Times will say: " 'Pink Flamingos' and 'Hairspray.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The sad irony of Divine's death just as rave reviews for "Hairspray" were 
coming in must have been a tremendous blow to you. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah. I hope nobody dies when this one opens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was it difficult for you at first to continue on as a filmmaker without one 
of your principal sources of inspiration? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. That's why with "Cry-baby" I made a movie about a man. But I certainly 
never thought I couldn't make a film without Divine. I'll be honest with you: I 
made "Desperate Living" without Divine, so I'd already made a movie without 
Divine. But I missed him on the set. I always had to fight to use Divine in my 
movies. Nobody ever wanted me to. And now he would have been so mad that a 
heterosexual drag queen (Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire) had the No. 1 movie 
in America. He would have felt gypped. If you have a wife, they love you in 
drag. If you don't: kinky!  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Patricia Hearst is in "Serial Mom," playing a key juror in the trial of 
Turner's character. You have admitted that you had been obsessed with her. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I was. I was obsessed with her trial, which made her nervous. But she 
didn't know that when I was at her trial. That was the hardest trial to get 
into since the (Charles) Lindbergh baby. People waited three days in sleeping 
bags and stuff. I waited 12 hours, easy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you think of her then? And was that how she really was when you 
actually met her? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Paul Schrader movie called "Patty Hearst" changed my mind about 
everything. Patricia has said to me: "It's because of people like you that I 
went to jail, because you wanted me to be something that I was not!" And she's 
right. We wanted her to be this bad-girl heiress when really she was 
brainwashed and a horrible thing happened to her. She was sitting at home doing 
her homework. But we didn't want to hear about that. So we made her into this 
together thing that really she was not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On a somewhat related matter, I understand that you advocate having 
convicted Manson follower Leslie Van Houten released from prison.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, if I'm talking about this for the Los Angeles Times, I have to 
clarify that: Los Angeles is the place where it happened. I know it is a very 
delicate situation. Leslie is a friend of mine. I'm not talking about anyone 
else in the "family." I met her in 1983 when I was interested in interviewing 
her for a possible story for Rolling Stone. We became friends, so I didn't 
write an article about her.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe in rehabilitation. If you believe in rehabilitation, Leslie is 
rehabilitated. The psychiatrist at the prison says: "She shouldn't even have to 
see me." The parole board knows she's rehabilitated. I believe she deserves a 
second chance. I am not saying any of this for shock value. What she did was 
horrible; I'm not saying it wasn't. She isn't either. She's been in jail some 
20-some years. She is paying for it.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, I've made a movie that's a comedy about a serial killer. 
That's a very, very different thing. I want to keep those two issues separate. 
I told Leslie I was making this movie just so that she would not think it was 
about her or about my experience with her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your perspective on the Menendez case? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, that was certainly an interesting case, especially now, because 
everybody has doubts. There are also some wild inconsistencies and they never 
say they did it. It's never as interesting if they admit guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Well, they admit they did it but contend that it was in fear for their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A: But they don't admit the guilt! They have reason, blah, blah, blah. What 
I'm saying is that is why it is the A-list trial in America. Suzanne Somers was 
offered the part of Kitty Menendez in a TV movie. She called me roaring to tell 
me. I said: "You should take it! I'd love that!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you a romantic? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Valentine's Day is my mother's birthday. If I'm wildly in love, I've sent 
people chicken hearts, which seems to appeal to the kind of person that I've 
been in love with. But no one got a chicken heart from me this year. It's an 
off year. I'm only in like. I just received a very funny card from a friend of 
mine. Have you seen these new cards where you open it up and you can record 
anything you want for the greeting? His said: "I hate you!" I bet they just 
made a fortune because everyone must be saying: "(expletive) you!" You can 
really abuse what they thought this up for, which I think is great. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it safe to assume that you are out of the closet? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, sure. I've always been out. I've never said I wasn't gay, but people 
never have the nerve to ask me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think about fellow gay filmmakers who are not out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's their business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You couldn't care less? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I care. I'm certainly not going to tell other people what they should do 
with their own personal lives. I think it's certainly easier for a director to 
be out. What difference does that make? The public is not going to see a movie 
because the director is gay or straight. It's maybe a little harder for an 
actor or actress because of, you know, the love roles and stuff. But gay people 
have been impersonating heteros in the movies for years, and this year a 
straight person -- Tom Hanks -- won an Oscar for playing a gay person. So, 
hopefully, that is becoming less of an issue. I think it would have been really 
great if a gay person had played a gay person. That's brave!  
</P>
<P>
 I think Tom Hanks was great in "Philadelphia," but the Baltimore Sun came to 
me and asked: "Didn't you think he was brave?" 
</P>
<P>
 I said: "Brave? No -- he's a known heterosexual. It's a great stretch, and 
he'll win an Oscar. What's brave about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a film director. Gay is an adjective that I certainly am, but I don't know 
that it's my first one. I think if you're just a gay filmmaker, you get 
pigeonholed just like if you say I'm a black filmmaker, I'm a Spanish 
filmmaker, I'm a whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would surprise people about John Waters? What is your one dirty little 
secret? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Silence. ) I once voted Republican. For President Ford. I still like him. 
I like the whole family. That's why I voted for him. Once. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there one theme in your films? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is an overall thread, and it's always that outsiders win and people 
that are comfortable with their insanity and are not bitter. And the losers are 
always the people who are uncomfortable with their own insanity and complain 
and are bitter and try to take it out on others. "Serial Mom" is comfortable 
with what she does. She is not guilty. She is doing what she thinks is best. I 
do too.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In your book "Crackpot," you include among your favorite Hollywood things 
Frederick's of Hollywood, Pia Zadora and the National Enquirer. Do you have any 
new discoveries that make Hollywood special for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I was there a day after the earthquake. So I experienced all of the 
aftershocks. I admit I went ghouling around to look at earthquake damage. And 
when I was in Santa Monica, I saw a beauty parlor that had been hit and the 
front had the plywood on it. Spray-painted on the front was: "Alive and Still 
Doing Hair!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the last book you read? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Putting on a thick Southern drawl) "M-y-y S-o-n!" (actually called "A 
Father's Story") by Jeffrey Dahmer's father. I'm very interested in the 
families of the people who did something horrible. It is an incredible trauma 
for them also. It's a scary story. People threw eggs at their house, and he had 
to go back to work. He said that some of his co-workers said: "I don't know 
what I could possibly say to you." Some would offer help, and some would act 
like nothing had happened. Imagine! Your son is Jeffrey Dahmer, and your friend 
says: "Hi! Have you been on vacation?"  
</P>
<P>
 It's the infamy of crime which has really always fascinated me. Much more than 
the crime itself. That's what "Serial Mom" is about. Reading the Dahmer book 
was very relaxing. It was snowing out; I stayed home all day and read it cover 
to cover. (Smiles, then pauses.) It was a perfect Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: May I see the rest of the house? I see you have an electric chair in your 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 A: (With much pride) Yes. . . . Oh, Gawd. I feel like Jackie Kennedy giving a 
tour of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Waters will speak at a special screening of "Serial Mom" at 7 p.m. 
Tuesday at the Laemmle Monica Theatre, 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica, in an 
Independent Feature Project/West discussion moderated by Quentin Tarantino. For 
reservations and information, call IFP/West, (310) 392-8832.

 "If after I read a poem the world looks like that poem for 24 hours or so, I'm 
sure it's a good one," Elizabeth Bishop wrote to Robert Lowell. Yesterday, 
about to review her letters, I read through Bishop's collected poems. Today, 
the world is still caught in a quick-change of guises: from the great fish with 
five hooks in its lip, "a five-haired beard of wisdom"; to "the frail, illegal 
fire balloons" rising above the Brazilian hilltop where she spent a dozen 
years; to the love she shared with Lowell, not erotic but carnal as the bond 
between twins, along with a tumultuous joint tenancy in the Maine coast and the 
comradeship of poetry. These she evoked after his death: 
</P>
<P>
 You left North Haven, anchored in  
</P>
<P>
 its rock  
</P>
<P>
 afloat in mystic blue . . . And now --  
</P>
<P>
 you've left  
</P>
<P>
 for good. You can't derange, or  
</P>
<P>
 re-arrange,  
</P>
<P>
 your poems again. (But the Sparrows  
</P>
<P>
 can their song.)  
</P>
<P>
 The words won't change again. Sad  
</P>
<P>
 friend, you cannot change.  
</P>
<P>
 After her own death in 1979, Bishop has increasingly come to be seen, along 
with Lowell, as one of the two greatest poets of the generation that followed 
Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams and 
Marianne Moore. It is possible though not really interesting to think that she 
may come to outrank him. A poem is a trumpet or a lantern; his sounded more 
compellingly, hers illuminated more. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few peaceful lives in their cohort. Lowell's storms of mania are 
well known; so are the suicides of John Berryman and Theodore Roethke. Bishop's 
life was less publicly desperate. But the more than 500 letters selected out of 
several thousand by Robert Giroux, her longtime editor and friend, tell of 
fragility, tormented self-questioning, bouts of alcoholic oblivion, and a 
near-breakdown or two. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several lesbian love affairs that the letters only indirectly touch 
upon. They give a full account -- though sex is never mentioned -- of the 15 
years she lived in Brazil with her lover, Lota Macedo Soares, a distinguished 
feminist and public figure. They were the happiest years of her life but they 
ended with Lota's suicide and recriminations from family and friends who blamed 
Bishop for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Countering these darknesses were a frail but redoubtable endurance and a 
stubborn moral sense -- drawn in part, perhaps, from her Nova Scotia childhood. 
There was also playful humor, a gift for friendship, food and outings, a 
lyrical instinct for the shape of others' lives, and faith in the discipline of 
beauty instilled by her early mentor, Marianne Moore. All these qualities of 
light are the sinews of Bishop's poetry; they make it humane and enticingly 
readable despite its uncompromising aesthetic. The darkness is there but -- 
more than with most of her fellow confessional poets -- stoically restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters move in bands of light and darkness. In the early 1930s, her 
bright literary years at Vassar, they have a conquer-the-world feeling. There 
is a comic and revealing exchange with a stuffy (at the time) young Harvard 
poet, Donald Stanford, who told her that her sensibility was not suitable for a 
woman. He followed up with a poem about lust, veiled in neo-Edwardian 
euphemism. 
</P>
<P>
 She nailed him on "charms." "My God, how loathsome an expression that is. It 
represents surely one of the worst sides of masculinity -- to sum up three or 
four more exciting features of female anatomy and label them all with one 
convenient word." There seems, nevertheless, to have been a faint spark going 
-- her sexual orientation may still have been cloudy -- until they met. 
Stanford was "sweet but very young," she wrote a friend, and her letters 
immediately turned polite and stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, she speaks of a poetry that moves to touch and agitate its subjects, 
even at the cost of roughness. Wallace Stevens' blank verse may "moo" but she 
likes that "it is such a display of ideas at work making poetry, the poetry 
making them. . . ." In the apprenticeship with Marianne Moore that followed 
Bishop's timid invitation to the circus, she marks her growing independence by 
occasionally taking issue with Moore's suggestions for avoiding awkwardness. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question, though, of her reverence for the older poet, or the 
great deal Moore taught her of how to be precise in extravagance, and of the 
fine angular wonders to be found in the world of plants and animals. She writes 
with awe of the pains Moore would take with a poem; years later it would take 
Bishop 16 years to complete her own golden "The Moose." Lowell wrote: "Do/you 
still hang your words in air, ten years/unfinished, glued to your noticeboard, 
with gaps/or empties for the unimaginable phrase?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her correspondence with Lowell began around the time her first book, "North & 
South" was published in 1945, and continued until his death. Much of it is 
about poetry, and richly rewarding -- Moore, her mentor, gave way to Lowell, 
her fellow warrior -- but there is an underlying confidence and intimacy that 
seems to grow richer as time passes. The relationship had its strains. At one 
point Lowell thought he was in love with her; a fluttering that Bishop was at 
pains to ignore though it probably caused her stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop went through a dark few years after the publication of "North & South." 
Her letters mention alcoholic benders and her difficulty in controlling 
herself. A stint at the writers' colony at Yaddo is a nightmare. She is 
agonizingly shy, gets no writing done, spends her time blowing soap bubbles on 
her balcony and complains that the place smells "of old lunchboxes." Her year 
as poetry consultant for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington was equally 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
 After a casual trip to Brazil and her meeting with Lota, her letters change 
like bare trees flowering. The couple moves to Lota's estate in the mountains 
and Bishop finds, in the Brazilian's love and protection, the confidence to be 
happy and to open up her poetry to a new world. First with Moore, later with 
Lota and finally with Alice Methfessel -- now her executor -- Bishop looked for 
someone not so much to protect her life as to vouch for it. She couldn't do it 
for herself; all her vouching went into her poetry. She vouched for the things 
she wrote about. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last years with Lota, Bishop's letters speak of a protectiveness that 
became confining and dictatorial. In poor health and under stress, Lota became 
violently critical; eventually she suffered a breakdown. Doctors advised a 
separation, and Bishop traveled to New York; Lota followed. On their first 
night together, Lota went to another room and took a fatal overdose of Valium. 
Her family accused Bishop of causing the suicide and kept up an unremitting 
hostility when she returned to Brazil to settle her affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters are detailed and agonizing. A second agony came when Bishop 
entered a relationship with a young woman who suffered a schizophrenic 
breakdown when they moved to a house Bishop owned in Ouro Preto. A move to 
Harvard, where she met Methfessel -- who comes across as a kind of angel of 
helpfulness and balance -- provided a certain serenity for her last years, 
despite bad health, money worries and a sense of being used up. The last 
letters, if not happy, have a stoic grace and wit to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection is a treasure. It is also an undeveloped treasure and, to some 
degree, a wasted one. Giroux, who took over the editing after the original 
editor died, has made a fine selection. He has written a perceptive and 
illuminating foreword. But he has left the body of the correspondence virtually 
without notes. 
</P>
<P>
 All kinds of allusions and gaps are left unexplained and unilluminated. Almost 
never do we get an idea -- except to the degree that Bishop herself suggests 
one -- of what she is responding to. We have to piece together for ourselves 
the details of her alcoholic collapses. When Harcourt Brace writes a cool 
response to her first collection we want to know what it is. How did her years 
in Key West turn sour, as they evidently did, in the early 1940s? Why is there 
a 10-month gap in 1943? An allusion to trouble with Marianne Moore goes 
unelaborated. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again we need a clue from the editor -- or even an "I don't know" -- 
and don't get it. Ideally, the reader of a published letter should know about 
as much as the recipient does. Often this is not possible but in this case -- 
had greater pains been taken -- quite often it would have been.

 "Raveling's Rules" (by Patrick Goldstein, March 13) was right on target. I've 
known George Raveling since 1975, when he was head basketball coach at 
Washington State University and I was a goofy-looking, uncoordinated and rather 
shy member of the student body. When we first met, he bawled me out in his 
office for having written him a somewhat critical letter. Then he turned the 
entire meeting around by enlisting my help and making me feel that I was 
actually participating in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach is a loyal man who doesn't forget those who have crossed his path. 
After I graduated, he continued to send me clippings about the team and invite 
me to functions. I respect both Raveling the man and the impact he has had on 
my life and the lives of others.

 The most important aspect of the Raveling article was its emphasis on the 
positive. We need more of this type of reporting and writing instead of the 
negative kind that we see too much of in newspapers and magazines and on TV.

 Goldstein's article lets Raveling maunder on about how much he cares and about 
how much respect he has earned. But claims of that type seem to be typical 
subterfuge for the continuance of a career that has been steadfastly mediocre, 
first at Washington State, then at Iowa, lately at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 A 35% graduation rate is not much to brag about when one considers how few 
student athletes the coach, his assistants and his army of tutors are 
responsible for. If the USC School of Business were to graduate only 35% of 
either scholarship or non-scholarship students, heads would be adorning poles 
around Tommy Trojan. Perhaps if Raveling spent less time giving etiquette 
lessons or daydreaming in his office and more time coaching his charges, he'd 
not need to spoon-feed disinformation to naive reporters.

VIETNAM EPILOGUE

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the actions of the young Vietnamese men involved in the Good Guys tragedy 
represent the worst nightmare for an immigrant's family, then author Andrew Lam 
surely represents such a family's most honorable and best dreams ("Love, Money, 
Prison, Sin, Revenge," March 13). It was a tough, honest, perceptive and 
poignant article by a great writer.

 Lam's article is journalism at its best, providing facts and insight into a 
modern-day tragedy that might easily have been dismissed as "just another 
hostage situation." His bridging of the Vietnamese and American cultures serves 
both well. We are all better humans for the understanding he has given us.

 The people of Vietnam were not losers. They had opted for secession from the 
world imperialist-colonialist system, for the right to run their own affairs, 
for their freedom. We peace activists still celebrate their victory over a 
ruthless invader that bombed, killed, wounded, maimed and poisoned an innocent 
people.

 Vietnamese living in the United States, and Americans, too, can stop saying 
they were on the losing side of the war. Although we did not enjoy a 
traditional military victory, the action helped lead to the fall of worldwide 
communism. No one need hang his or her head and worry that the war was fought 
in vain. Nor should the war be used as an excuse for violent, antisocial 
behavior of the type described in Lam's article.

 Lam is so determined to shoehorn these murderers into his own romantic 
scenario that he, while reminding us constantly that he's a journalist, has 
neglected to interview the people who bred and raised three killers -- their 
parents. And where does the end of this article find us? Alongside Lam, placing 
an offering on the graves of the murderers.

 I hope Lam's article doesn't leave readers with the impression that Vietnamese 
youths are a bunch of gun-toting, ginseng-crazed, dysfunctional people whose 
only aim is to kill all the Viet Cong to avenge their fathers' lost glory. I 
don't think that the Vietnamese community wants to be known by the number of 
times it appears on the 11 o'clock news. Let's see that event for what it was, 
an unfortunate and isolated occurrence.

MOVIES; JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO. . .AND STU; YOU MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD OF 
STUART SUTCLIFFE, BUT THE NEW FILM 'BACKBEAT' CLAIMS HE WAS A PRIME INFLUENCE 
ON WHAT BECAME THE BEATLES 
</P>

<P>
 Stu Sutcliffe has been at best a footnote in the history of the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 A Liverpool art student and perhaps the closest friend of John Lennon, 
Sutcliffe played bass guitar for three years with the Beatles -- but well 
before their stratospheric rise to fame began in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 He quit the group during the group's sojourn playing in Hamburg nightclubs and 
remained in the German city to pursue a life and career as an artist. But the 
artistic promise shown by his abstract paintings was cut short: Sutcliffe died 
of a brain hemorrhage in April, 1962, just before his 22nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 32 years after his death, there are signs that Sutcliffe's impact on the 
Beatles is ripe for reappraisal. In part this is due to "BackBeat," a British 
film opening in Los Angeles Friday that deals with Sutcliffe's short life, his 
career with the Beatles, his friendship with Lennon and his love affair in 
Hamburg with Astrid Kirchherr, a young German art student and photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance buzz about the movie -- and favorable reviews after its opening here 
two weeks ago -- has triggered renewed interest in Sutcliffe's influence on the 
Beatles, which some observers feel has been unfairly underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Hamburg, Sutcliffe was drawn to a group of young avant-garde German 
art students, of which Kirchherr was a member. They called themselves the 
"Exis," short for existentialists, and were characterized by their distinctive 
dress and hairstyles. Because of the relationship between Stuart and Astrid, 
the other members of the Beatles freely mixed with the Exis, and clearly came 
under their influence in terms of their appearance and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 More important in the long term, the Exis helped implant in the Beatles the 
notion that they could conceive of themselves not merely as a pop group, but as 
artists working within the field of pop music. Lennon, who admired Sutcliffe 
and Kirchherr, was apparently intrigued with this notion. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the Beatles were the first pop musicians whose work consciously 
developed from album to album and the first to absorb influences from serious 
art. Many people close to the Beatles in those days now see in the romance of 
Stuart and Astrid the foreshadowing of another relationship: the one between 
John Lennon and Yoko Ono, an artist who greatly influenced him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirchherr, speaking by phone from Hamburg, says of the Exis: "You expressed 
yourself by looking different from other people. We even looked different from 
each other. But among the Exis, there was a close group of us, Klaus Voormann, 
Jurgen Wollmer and me. Klaus and I always wore black. The minimum of color 
would be a white shirt. It was black polo neck sweaters (which the Beatles wore 
on the cover of their second album "With the Beatles") and very tight black 
trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Klaus and Jurgen had this hairstyle, with the hair brushed forward, which we 
called the Exicut. When I met the Beatles, they were wearing these funny little 
leather jackets, which inspired me. I had a suit made for myself out of fine, 
good black leather. It looked different. I was using leather but putting a 
different fashion angle on how it looked. So it wasn't only us influencing the 
Beatles, but the other way round too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Softley, who directed "BackBeat" and has spent nine years researching and 
developing Stuart Sutcliffe's story, says: "Astrid gave Stuart an Exicut, with 
his hair brushed forward. It was the first Beatles cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only Stuart had the balls to try out the haircut. The others weren't so keen. 
Then George cut his hair that way. Later, John and Paul got their haircuts on a 
trip to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Beatles met Astrid and her friends in Hamburg and saw the life they led, 
and the way they were living their art. It was a big influence on how the 
Beatles thought about themselves. The way they wore their hair, the clothes 
they wore, the fact that they could use contemporary artists to package their 
albums -- these things became important. And for the Beatles, Hamburg became a 
kind of mythological place where all these seeds were sewn." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, Hamburg was a wild city. Like the Beatles' hometown, Liverpool, it is 
a port, and like many ports, it boasted an array of attractions for sailors on 
shore leave. The notorious Reeperbahn district, where the Beatles played in a 
number of clubs, was the city's red-light district, littered with brothels and 
strip joints where drugs were readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they found it extremely exciting," says Pauline Sutcliffe, Stuart's 
younger sister and executor of his estate. "Stuart wrote to me about being 
given the eye by a gorgeous blonde in the street, only to discover that she was 
a he. I'm sure they'd never seen a transvestite or transsexual before in their 
lives. I think they did a lot of growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Stu Sutcliffe joined the embryonic Beatles in 1959. His skills on bass guitar 
were rudimentary -- but as a student at Liverpool Art School he had sold a 
painting to local business tycoon John Moores for 60 and bought a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to ask why they would take someone into their group who was not a 
musician, and did not even have their beginning skills," says Sutcliffe, 
sitting in her elegant West London apartment, the rooms of which are filled 
with Stuart's paintings. She is convinced that Lennon was the decisive 
influence; Stuart was tremendously self-assured and confident for an 
18-year-old boy, and Lennon was in awe of him and his artistic talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she insists, the Beatles' abilities were well hidden at this stage. 
"I remember in 1959 I was dispatched by my mother to go and see them. My 
parents frowned on the idea of him being in this group, but they didn't dismiss 
it out of hand. So I went along with Stuart to this incredibly seedy joint in 
Liverpool. I must have been 15. As far as I can remember, none of them were 
particularly skilled." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, she pulls from a file the photocopy of a Beatles playlist of a 
gig dating from around this time. It is a genuine piece of pop music history, 
and is notable for the number of songs the Beatles performed back then but 
never recorded: Ray Charles' "What'd I Say" and "Hallelujah I Just Love Her 
So," Chuck Berry's "Carol" and "Johnny B. Goode," Buddy Holly's "True Love 
Ways" and Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On." Also included on the 
list were two Carl Perkins songs, "Blue Suede Shoes" and "Honey Don't," an 
unidentified piece called "Rock-a-Chicka," and two instrumentals written by 
their group -- "Winston's Walk" and "Cat's Walk" (Winston was Lennon's middle 
name). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't describe to my mother how seedy the joint was," Pauline Sutcliffe 
continued. "I had the sense not to do that. Instead I said: 'Well, Mother, they 
could play a whole tune!' That's how low one's expectations were. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the group evolved, none of this was supposed to impinge on Stuart's art 
school life. The group was a boy's hobby; it was not how he intended making a 
living." 
</P>
<P>
 In summer 1960, Alan Williams, then the Beatles' manager, offered them a 
chance to play in Hamburg for a month. One assumes that the lurid attractions 
of Hamburg night life were spelled out as an inducement. "But Stuart found a 
way of presenting it to my mother that made it seem all right," recalls 
Pauline. "It was an experience, another country, it was just for a month, it 
wouldn't interfere with art school. They drove to Germany in Alan's van, which 
seemed to be held together with string." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg was the place where a number of Liverpool's "Merseybeat" groups went 
to cut their teeth in the early 1960s, including the Searchers, the Big Three 
and Rory Storm & the Hurricanes, who featured a drummer called Richard Starkey 
or Ringo Starr. The Beatles' first trip to Hamburg came about only because the 
Hurricanes, who were of marginally higher status, pulled out, having received a 
better offer from a vacation camp in England. 
</P>
<P>
 John, Paul, George, Stuart and the Beatles' then drummer Pete Best played 
their first Hamburg gigs in a strip joint called the Indra Club, as a kind of 
audition for playing a larger club, the Kaiserkeller. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a myth which says Stuart still couldn't really play at this point," 
says Softley. "But while they were at the Indra, the bass player in another 
group at the Kaiserkeller fell ill, and Stuart was sent on ahead of the 
Beatles, as it were, to deputize for him. So he can't have been that bad." In 
Softley's research he talked to Liverpool pop group leader Howie Casey, who 
confirmed that Sutcliffe "had a great live style." And Klaus Voormann, who was 
then living with Astrid Kirchherr, remembered him as "a very good dance band 
bass player." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Softley: "Apparently he was very punk, very insistent. He would turn his 
bass up really loud, also it was dominant and driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Voormann was the first of the Exis to encounter the Beatles, and became an 
important figure in their circle for several years. He was signed by Brian 
Epstein, who managed the Beatles from 1961 until his death in 1967, to a 
recording contract as one-third of the group Paddy, Klaus & Gibson. In his 
capacity as artist, he drew the cover of the 1966 Beatles album "Revolver." He 
played on Lennon's album "Imagine" and George Harrison's "Concert for Bangla 
Desh," and toured with the Plastic Ono Band. (Voormann declined to be 
interviewed for this article.) 
</P>
<P>
 Astrid Kirchherr still remembers vividly the night when Voormann first saw the 
Beatles. "He had gone one evening to the Reeperbahn. He went to the cinema and 
afterward he was walking around when he heard this noise coming from a cellar. 
He followed the noise, and saw this English rock 'n' roll band playing. He's 
heard the music on records, but never heard it played live before. He couldn't 
believe his eyes or ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got home, he was very excited. He asked me to go along and see them. 
I didn't feel like going. . .but he persuaded me and I went along with him to 
the Kaiserkeller Club. I was wanting something new, and for me the Beatles 
were. . .outstanding. I was breathless, speechless." 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers they played only cover versions of hits by American artists: 
Wilbert Harrison's "Kansas City" and a lot of Chuck Berry and Little Richard 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all wore very tight jeans and pointed shoes, and they had fantastic 
hairdos, with their hair swept up high," Kirchherr recalls. "From the first 
moment, I found Stuart the most attractive. He had a mystique. He always wore 
dark glasses on stage. He knew he was a terrific performer just by looking cool 
and smoking a cigarette. You couldn't overlook him." 
</P>
<P>
 During a break, Voormann introduced Astrid to Sutcliffe and Lennon. "They were 
very polite and well mannered, so different from the way they looked," she 
says. "My English wasn't so good then, so our conversation was very draggy. We 
explained everything with our hands. But they were very pleasant people. Being 
a portrait photographer, I didn't know which of their faces I wanted to take a 
picture of first." 
</P>
<P>
 Astrid and Klaus told the Exis about the Beatles, and started going to see 
them every night. Word spread among the art-school group, and soon a group of 
distinctive looking Exis were mingling nightly among the Beatles' audiences in 
sweaty, airless little basement clubs like the Kaiserkeller. Jurgen Wollmer, a 
photographer and an Exi friend of Astrid and Klaus, became a devoted Beatles 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
 French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre was a huge influence to the Exis, she 
says. So was avant-garde writer Jean Cocteau. She was also a fan of French 
actors Gerard Philipe and Jean-Louis Barrault, while her preference for black 
clothes came from the Left Bank chanteuse Juliette Greco. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutcliffe was only 20 at the time, but, says Kirchherr, "he was so confident 
about being an artist. The way he talked, he was so mature and intelligent. 
From the first time I saw them, I knew they weren't just five dirty little boys 
from Liverpool without an education. 
</P>
<P>
 "John was. . ." -- she pauses, looking for the right word. An enigma? "Yes. He 
could play tough, there was a pretense, then he could be serious, loving and 
caring. But Stuart was the one. He knew he could walk on stage and do his 
cool-cat thing, but when he came off he was an intelligent artist, a 
charismatic young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after meeting the Beatles, Astrid started taking her extraordinary 
pictures of the group in Hamburg. They still had their Teddy Boy pompadours in 
those days, and favored leather jackets. In many of the pictures, which 
emphasize how young and innocent they looked despite their affectations of 
toughness, it is notable that Sutcliffe, his eyes obscured behind dark glasses, 
seems apart from the rest -- detached and in some cases even looking in another 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Later she dressed Stuart, then the other Beatles in black leather and 
collarless jackets of the kind associated with the group in the earliest days 
of their fame. Put simply, she was an extraordinarily strong influence in 
shaping the Beatles' identity, style and sense of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair between Kirchherr and Voormann cooled, and Sutcliffe, who quit the 
Beatles in 1961, moved into her Hamburg flat. Through her he met the 
internationally renowned artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi, then teaching at 
Hamburg Art School; Paolozzi was so impressed by Sutcliffe's talent that he 
secured him a scholarship at the school: a rare accolade for a non-German 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Pauline Sutcliffe and Kirchherr confirm that Stuart worked relentlessly 
on the large swirling abstracts he favored. "He painted day and night. He 
allowed himself almost no rest," Kirchherr says. 
</P>
<P>
 But around this time, Sutcliffe started experiencing splitting headaches. The 
cause was never clear. But in England, the Beatles had often been the target of 
young men jealous of their girlfriends' affections. In one violent incident 
(dates vary, though 1960 is often mentioned), Sutcliffe was beaten up by a 
hooligan and suffered a blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went from one doctor to another," Kirchherr remembers. "None of them could 
find out what was wrong. Of course, back then, they didn't have all the brain 
scans and equipment they have now." 
</P>
<P>
 He died unexpectedly in April, 1962, about 10 minutes after complaining of a 
particularly bad headache. He and Astrid were to have been married two months 
later. An autopsy revealed a brain hemorrhage. "There are areas of doubt," says 
Pauline Sutcliffe now. "He was beaten up, it's a fact, but was the blow to the 
head the precursor of brain hemorrhage? What with the timing of the incident in 
relation to his death, I have my doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 Events moved with astonishing speed after Stuart's death. That month, the 
Beatles were in Hamburg, on their fourth and last tour of the city's clubs; 
outside Liverpool and Hamburg, they were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1962, back in England, Brian Epstein sacked Pete Best and replaced 
him with Ringo Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1962, the Beatles recorded their first single, "Love Me Do." 
</P>
<P>
 And by the first anniversary of Stuart Sutcliffe's death, they had become the 
biggest pop sensations Britain had ever produced. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Beatlemania of 1964, Sutcliffe's paintings drew 10,000 visitors to 
Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery. Since then, art historian John Willett has 
described him as "an outstanding loss to Liverpool and quite possibly to 
English painting, and over and above the merit of his pictures, he has a 
special significance as somebody whose burning creativity switched from art 
into pop music and then back again. He showed the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirchherr is now back living in Hamburg. "I work as an assistant for a music 
publishing company," she says. "I tried to work as a photographer again when I 
came back here five years ago. But it didn't work out -- you need big studios, 
500 cameras, 1,000 flashlights and champagne on the table. That wasn't me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutcliffe's parents are both dead. Pauline Sutcliffe, who was just 18 when her 
brother died, is now a successful family therapist, and has been working for 
years on a book about him, featuring his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 And after nine years research, Ian Softley got to direct "BackBeat." 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, a feature film scratches the surface of an era's historical 
details, and Softley is unapologetic that "BackBeat" is "about Stuart and 
Astrid and John, and the divisions and points of contact of love and 
friendship. It's about people discovering their identity, discovering 
relationships with other people, the difference between love and sex, and a 
kind of breakdown of stereotypes of conventional modes of behavior. Stuart and 
Astrid's behavior was certainly ahead of its time." 
</P>
<P>
 Softley views the Hamburg era as crucial for the Beatles: "I was looking for a 
story that explores what young people are looking for at a time when they 
spread their wings, go on journeys and break out of the world they live in. For 
the Beatles, Hamburg was that place." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, two American actors fill the lead roles. Stephen Dorff ("The 
Power of One") plays Stuart while Sheryl Lee, best known as Laura Palmer from 
David Lynch's "Twin Peaks," is Astrid. English actor Ian Hart portrays Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirchherr and Pauline Sutcliffe do not communicate with each other. Sutcliffe 
says contact was lost when Astrid wed Gibson Kemp, of Paddy, Klaus & Gibson; 
Kirchherr says she never got along with the Sutcliffe family even when Stuart 
was alive, but bears them no ill-will. Yet both women are preoccupied by the 
lack of posthumous recognition Stuart Sutcliffe has received from the Beatles, 
their myth-makers and biographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutcliffe does not venture to suggest why this should be. Kirchherr believes 
the Beatles were too young and immature to be able to cope with Stuart's death: 
"They were so shocked and full of sadness when he died that instead of bursting 
out they just kept it to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutcliffe regrets that her brother's reputation as a painter has been 
dependent on his status as "the fifth Beatle:" "He was an artist first, then a 
rock 'n' roll lover. But when you die that young and you were in the Beatles, 
it's as though you can't be a good artist too. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes me very sad sometimes. I'm still very sad he died. There would 
have been some things coming of that boy which were unbelievable."

<P>
 Don't fear "Middlemarch." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the word from Louis Marks, the producer of the new "Masterpiece 
Theatre" series that begins this week on PBS. He hopes American audiences won't 
be turned off because the six-part drama is based on George Eliot's 700-plus 
page, classic 19th-Century British novel, which was more than likely required 
reading in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guiding light is not to be a period drama," says Marks, who also produced 
the "Masterpiece Theatre" presentations of Eliot's "Silas Marner" as well as "A 
Day at the Fair" and "Memento Mori." 
</P>
<P>
 "I banned the expression BBC classic drama because I think it sets up all 
sorts of bad feelings of costumes and period scenery. You have to set it in 
this time, but make it all very sort of unobtrusive. We have a wonderful 
costume designer who never talks about costumes. He talks about clothes and the 
people just wear clothes. " 
</P>
<P>
 Set in rural England of 1830, "Middlemarch" focuses on two characters: 
Dorothea Brooke (Juliet Aubrey) and Tertius Lydgate (Douglas Hodge). Dorothea 
is a passionate and idealistic young woman who becomes trapped into a loveless 
marriage with the Rev. Edward Casaubon (Patrick Malahide), an impotent 
clergyman scholar who is insanely jealous of the attention paid to Dorothea by 
his young cousin, Ladislaw (Rufus Sewell). 
</P>
<P>
 Tertius is a well-meaning doctor married to the beautiful but ruthless social 
climber Rosamund Vincy (Trevyn McDowell), whose spending causes the couple's 
downfall. Robert Hardy ("All Creatures Great and Small") also stars as the 
dimwitted Arthur Brooke, the uncle of Dorothea and her sister Celia (Caroline 
Harker). 
</P>
<P>
 Shot on location in Lincolnshire and Dorset in England and in Rome, 
"Middlemarch" harks back to such lavish period pieces as "The First 
Churchills," "Elizabeth R" and "The Jewel in the Crown," which dominated 
"Masterpiece Theatre" during its first decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Middlemarch" stayed on the BBC back burner for quite a while, but never moved 
to the table. "The will to do it is something which has grown up in the last 
few years because there have been changes in the BBC," Marks explains. "There's 
been a feeling that the BBC has to assert its individual voice. One of the 
things the BBC has to do is celebrate the great works of our culture and 
background." 
</P>
<P>
 And that means producing big projects, rather than smaller miniseries. 
"There's been a great mass of miniseries which have lasted two or three 
episodes," Marks says. "Some of them have been good, but the BBC felt there was 
a need to make a big impact with something that is a major novel." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 20 years, Marks says, "Middlemarch" has been viewed as the major 
English novel of the 19th Century, even surpassing the works of Charles 
Dickens. "There was a period when everybody thought of an English novel, they 
thought of Dickens. 'Middlemarch' is a much different novel, such a 
psychologically modern work somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 And a realistic one as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people have jobs and they know exactly their place in their societies and 
what they are after and what they are about," he notes. "That somehow matches 
our mood today. The book suddenly seems to be very accessible and very real and 
very true to the present time." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Anthony Page ("Bill," "The Patricia Neal Story") agrees with Marks. 
He was "knocked out" by the novel when he read it 20 years ago. "I don't think 
it's really a book for teen-agers," he explains. "It seemed to be like a French 
or Russian novel, dealing with marriage and relationships between men and 
women. It is sort of unsentimental, sort of ferocious compared to Dickens, who 
gets sort of sentimental." 
</P>
<P>
 Page believes Eliot's "strange life" influenced her writing. Eliot, the 
pseudonym of author Marian Evans, "was cut off from her family because she 
stopped being a practicing Christian and she lived with a married man. She was 
very much ostracized by conventional society." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans was making a stance by pretending to be a male writer: She would not let 
herself be classed along with those she mocked in an essay as "silly lady 
novelists." She was also very aware of her scandalous personal life and had no 
desire for more publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had an incredible objective viewpoint on humans," Page says. "I think 
she's a wonderful dramatist. The problem is how to fit it into 6 1/2 hours. 
Fortunately, we had a lot of time to cook the script." 
</P>
<P>
 When Marks began working on "Middlemarch" nearly two years ago, he read the 
book again to ascertain how it could be interpreted for the small screen. He 
discovered "Middlemarch" didn't need reinterpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a week to read it. When I finished, I put the book down and walked 
around the garden and thought, 'This is amazing.' Some of the scenes in the 
novel were perfect film scenes. The dialogue works in the way that good film 
dialogue works, where you feel there are forces that work through the scene. 
She doesn't write explicit dialogue; she writes dialogue which is true but 
dramatically powerful, because it's working on different levels." 
</P>
<P>
 To adapt the novel, Marks brought in Andrew Davies, who penned the 
contemporary "Masterpiece Theatre" political thrillers "House of Cards" and "To 
Play the King." 
</P>
<P>
 "Andrew's great thing is that he's not for revering the text," Marks says. "We 
were lucky we had three months to work on the script. Every day we met, we went 
through a page at a time of the script and the book. The fights (we had) were 
about how much can you have of George Eilot, while keeping it entertaining. The 
script was a kind of result of those fights. It was an interesting tension of 
how far can you go to modernize something without betraying the real value of 
the original." 
</P>
<P>
 The mammoth "Middlemarch" cast is made up of veteran British actors and 
newcomers. The auditioning process was extensive. "We got them to read from the 
book rather than the script," Page says. "The scenes are longer and more 
complicated and gives them a chance to explore the emotions. I just went (on 
auditioning) until the right person turned up." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as Juliet Aubrey, who plays Dorothea. "We have had quite a few screenings 
back home in England and people say she is close to the Dorothea in the book," 
Marks says. "Harold Pinter's wife, (writer) Antonia Fraser, who is a great 
'Middlemarch' buff, came to a screening. Afterward, she wrote me a note saying 
she was transfixed by Juliet's performance. She captured the essence of this 
girl, a restless, idealistic spirit, who wants to make her life worthwhile and, 
because of that, makes the most terrible mistake of marrying this dried-up old 
scholar." 
</P>
<P>
 The grueling schedule tested Page's stamina. "We started working on it in 
September '92 and it's literally been six days a week since then to get it 
done. When the filming began I had to become monastic. I had to stay in the 
hotel, not drink and go to bed early. It became like a long-distance race." 
</P>
<P>
 But he enjoyed every minute of it. "I love the book so much; it's such an 
extraordinary piece of work because of what it tells you about people. In that 
way, it was like being buoyed up. It was like surfing. It produces energy 
because you believe in it so much. I think everyone got rather possessed by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Middlemarch" begins Sunday at 8 p.m. on KVCR and 9 p.m. on KCET and KPBS; 
April 10 at 8 p.m. on KOCE.

ROBERT HARDY'S PATH TO 'MIDDLEMARCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Hardy begins to chuckle when asked to describe his character in 
"Middlemarch." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a ninny. He is a damned fool. It was great fun looking for the center 
of a man who is absolutely unable to make up his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lavish six-part adaptation of George Eliot's classic 19th-Century 
novel, Hardy plays the buffoonish Arthur Brooke, the eccentric but 
simple-minded lord of Tipton Grange, whose tenants live in horrible conditions. 
Brooke's attempt to run for Parliament fails miserably and he quite literally 
ends up with egg on his face when he's spattered while delivering a speech to 
taunting villagers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy was surprised when he was offered the role of Brooke. He didn't think 
the lengthy "Middlemarch" could be adapted for the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had read the book at school, but as little of it as I could get away with 
because it seemed overly thick to me," he says with a twinkle of his blue eyes. 
"I thought at that age, 16 or 17, this was big, heavy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 He read the book after he got the miniseries and, much to his surprise, loved 
it. "It's like any slice of life at any time," Hardy says, relaxing in a 
Pasadena hotel suite. "That's what we found when we got into it -- it's 
absolutely accessible and juicy and great fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy is a familiar face to fans of PBS and cable's Arts & Entertainment 
Network. He was the star of the "Masterpiece Theatre" series "Churchill: The 
Wilderness Years" and the long-running PBS and A&E series "All Creatures Great 
and Small," in which he played a stubborn, strong-willed Yorkshire vet. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing "Creatures" was a "way of life" for Hardy and his co-stars. "It was 
extraordinary. From 1977 to 1990, we did seven series and three or four 
'Creatures' films in the process. There is one film left in the bank, undone. I 
think they were going to make the film, but it was the absolute bottom of the 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy's acting career has been affected before by unstoppable events: He was 
studying as a thespian at Oxford University when World War II broke out. He 
joined the Royal Air Force and was sent to Texas for pilot training. During a 
leave, Hardy made his first visit to Los Angeles. After the war, he returned to 
acting studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next time I came to California, I went to Ronald Colman's funeral in 
Santa Barbara," Hardy recalls. 'I was staying with my mother-in-law because I 
was engaged to her daughter. My mother-in-law was Gladys Cooper ("Now, 
Voyager"), who used to live in Pacific Palisades. This was 1956." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy remained in L.A. for the next few years, doing a lot of guest shots on 
TV and one feature, "Torpedo Run," with Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine. "There 
weren't many movies going. When we made the movie at the MGM sound stages 
there, that was the only stage on the whole of the MGM lot that was working. It 
was the only English part that came up in any movie. That particular time was 
not good for British interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Hardy has thought about coming back to L.A., "because I had 
such a good time. But, on the other hand, I'm very English and unless there is 
a particular call for an English actor ..." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the British film, TV and radio industries are going through a 
recession, Hardy's career is going strong. "It's not so bad if you are an aged 
thing like me and have been at it for a long time," Hardy explains with a 
smile. "People tend to say, 'We will get him. We know he will do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Hardy jumped at the chance when actor-director Kenneth Branagh 
offered him a part in his upcoming feature version of "Frankenstein." Hardy 
plays the professor in charge of a university medical program who suspects Dr. 
Frankenstein is up to no good. "He said, 'Come along and do this.' It was fun 
to be in." SUSAN KING

 THE AMAZING PAPER CUTTINGS OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN by Beth Wagner Brust. 
(Ticknor & Fields: $15.95; 80 pp.) As if he didn't do enough for us, the Danish 
storyteller Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), author of "Thumbelina," "The 
Little Mermaid," "The Ugly Duckling," "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The 
Steadfast Tin Soldier" and more than 150 other stories, was also the creator of 
these graceful, childlike, willowy paper cuttings.They recall Amish folk art, 
Alexander Calder and the wild uncle at family gatherings who made fabulous 
creations out of household debris. Best of all, writes Brust, Andersen usually 
made his delicate paper cuttings while telling fairy tales out loud, and always 
with an enormous pair of scissors. "What nonsense is this," said one of 
Andersen's characters in "Little Ida's Flowers" (his first published fairy 
tale), "to put into a child's head! All stuff and nonsense." Nonsense indeed, 
wonderful nonsense. SUSAN REYNOLDS

MY LIFE AS A DOGGERELIST, BY CALVIN TRILLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm at my desk -- not waiting for a muse  
</P>
<P>
 But for the Times, the Post, The Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 For deadline poets, muses are much rarer  
</P>
<P>
 Than tuning in MacNeil and his friend Lehrer.  
</P>
<P>
 It's they who, perched like ravens on my sill,  
</P>
<P>
 Deposit grist that's needed for my mill.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm stuck. I'm blank. The dreaded deadline looms.  
</P>
<P>
 I feel my brain is suited for legumes.  
</P>
<P>
 I cruise around the dial, I turn the page  
</P>
<P>
 To see who might appear upon the stage  
</P>
<P>
 As players whom their countrymen salute,  
</P>
<P>
 And targets for my bag of rotten fruit.  
</P>
<P>
 The news presents a motley little band  
</P>
<P>
 That I observe, tomato in my hand:  
</P>
<P>
 The congressmen fine-tuned to every fax  
</P>
<P>
 That indicates the wishes of their PACs;  
</P>
<P>
 The White House staff, the President's defenders,  
</P>
<P>
 All working late, and all in their suspenders;  
</P>
<P>
 The tasseled lobbyists, may God forgive us,  
</P>
<P>
 Who entertain with steaks washed down with  
</P>
<P>
 Chivas;  
</P>
<P>
 A President who always makes me feel  
</P>
<P>
 The last one was attacked with too much zeal;  
</P>
<P>
 A candidate who poses as our savior.  
</P>
<P>
 It helps if all are on their worst behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 The job of deadline poet is a calling  
</P>
<P>
 Dependent always on the most appalling  
</P>
<P>
 Behavior that our public figures show --  
</P>
<P>
 Supplies of which seem rarely to run low.  
</P>
<P>
 Rascality is what we need, plus greed  
</P>
<P>
 Overt enough to draw a blush from Tweed.  
</P>
<P>
 A fool is fine. A pompous fool's sublime.  
</P>
<P>
 It also helps if they have names that rhyme.  
</P>

 THE ORANGE TREE by Carlos Fuentes. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux: $21; 229 pp.) 
Fuentes presents numerous characters in these five novellas: The first 
protagonist, a translator and speaker of many Indian and Spanish dialects, 
allows Fuentes to explore the use and misuse of language in the creation of a 
culture; the sons of Cortes allow him to explore the unstable foundations of 
power lain in Mexico ("on the base of each column of this Catholic temple is 
inscribed an insignia of the Aztec gods"); the Roman narrator gives Fuentes a 
stage for the barbaric siege of Numantia ("We only hurt others when we're 
incapable of imagining them"); the black Irishman, proud descendant of the 
Spanish sailors, who wears a mask in life and death that even he does not 
recognize, allows Fuentes to play with the sordid remains of that heritage; and 
a sailor who turns Paradise over to the Japanese, completes Fuentes' version of 
history.These are legacies of lying, violence, greed and despair, and running 
through all the novellas is the image of an orange tree, fragrant and 
bountiful, in the center of the city of Numantia.

<P>
 In 1997, the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion will get a flashy new 
neighbor: the $200-million Frank O. Gehry-designed Disney Concert Hall. Disney 
Hall will become the new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- as well as the 
spectacular new showpiece of Bunker Hill's Los Angeles Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 And suddenly, the stately Chandler, current home of the Philharmonic and the 
annual Academy Awards, will become the symphony orchestra's old house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney Hall, I predict, is going to become not just a symbol for Los Angeles, 
but a point of entry to the Pacific Rim of the United States," said Music 
Center President Shelton g. Stanfill during a recent conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stanfill, the bright white limestone-and-stainless-steel 
structure -- which has been compared to everything from a flower to furled 
sheets of paper to the Sydney (Australia) Opera House -- will energize and 
humanize the Music Center. He said that Disney Hall -- along with a new, 
improved Ahmanson Theatre, which is undergoing a massive "reconfiguring" and is 
to reopen in 1995 -- will change the elitist aura of the Music Center to 
something more user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the Pavilion? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was named after Music Center founder Dorothy 
Buffum Chandler, now 93, wife of former Los Angeles Times Publisher Norman 
Chandler. The building -- a chandeliered structure ringed by columns -- was the 
first Music Center theater to open, in 1964. In 1967, it was joined by the Mark 
Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre (where "Phantom of the Opera" ran for four 
years before closing last August). 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who hail Disney Hall -- initiated by a $50-million gift from 
Walt Disney's widow, Lillian, in 1987 -- as the savior of the Music Center. 
They see a bright future with new, expanded programming moving into the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion, including increased opportunities for dance. But there are 
others, including skeptical members of the Music Center board of governors, who 
have worried in recent years that Disney Hall will become the Music Center, 
draining life from the existing theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the L.A. Philharmonic's move to Disney Hall create a vacuum at 
the Dorothy Chandler, but the Music Center's operating company must be 
responsible for making use of Disney Hall during the 12 to 14 weeks a year the 
Philharmonic will not perform there because of its touring commitments and the 
Hollywood Bowl season. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate destiny of the Ahmanson -- after its $17-million face lift is 
complete -- has already been determined: The Broadway hit "Miss Saigon" will 
open there in January for a nine-month run. The Mark Taper Forum will maintain 
its theater season of four or five plays a year. But the future of the Chandler 
Pavilion remains a more open question. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Davidson, Center Theatre Group artistic director/producer, joked that 
when Disney Hall was first proposed, resident company directors' primary worry 
wasn't that Disney Hall would drain artistic resources, "just all the money -- 
that's all." Indeed, some board members have protested that building a 
$200-million concert hall in the midst of a recession -- for a symphony that 
already has a place to perform -- represents a waste of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, because the Disney gift will cover only part of the cost of building 
Disney Hall, board members worried that fund-raising for Disney Hall will 
exacerbate the already difficult task of raising funds to support the Music 
Center's four resident performing companies: the Philharmonic, the Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera, Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum and the Master 
Chorale. (Since 1987, accrued interest and additional gifts from the Disney 
family have raised the Disney contribution to $92 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Music Center officials acknowledge that initial plans for Disney Hall raised 
fears as well as hopes, but they say that most concerns have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not going to see dark houses here because of Disney Hall," said 
Sandra Kimberling, president of the Music Center Operating Co., which is 
responsible for scheduling the various resident company performances and other 
attractions into Music Center theaters. "With the growth of Disney Hall is 
going to come growth in all the buildings. It is going to encourage growth. We 
aren't going to hear people saying, 'But how are you going to fill it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling cited three main proposals that could keep the lights on at the 
Dorothy Chandler: an expanded opera season, more dance programs and more 
musicals. She added that there is no danger of the Academy Awards' moving to 
Disney Hall because that hall will not have a proscenium stage. 
</P>
<P>
 During the initial stages of Disney Hall planning, Kimberling said, the Music 
Center's four resident companies each sat down and drew up projections for its 
1997-98 season. Early projections were needed, she said, to persuade both Los 
Angeles County (which is financing the $81.5-million Disney Hall garage) and 
skeptical board members that the center needed a new hall. For the opera 
company and the symphony, perpetually in pursuit of the best guest stars and 
conductors, such early planning is standard: "The sort of people we need to be 
involved -- Placido Domingo, David Hockney -- they do plan four or five years 
in advance," said Peter Hemmings, executive director of the Los Angeles Music 
Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling also said she does not foresee any problems booking the empty weeks 
at Disney Hall, pointing out that the operating company has agreed with the 
Philharmonic that the orchestra will make arrangements to book other 
orchestras, classical music performers or possibly jazz musicians into the 
hall. And, she said, the Philharmonic will need to have more concerts in its 
regular series to accommodate subscription ticket-holders because Disney Hall 
will be smaller than the Chandler -- 2,380 seats versus 3,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling added that more time available at the Pavilion will allow for more 
maintenance and set-up time for special events such as the Academy Awards, as 
well as offer more space for other special events and short-term bookings: "We 
can't really compete with the summer fare at the Greek and all that -- people 
want to be outside and see their pop artists -- but getting something like the 
Bette Midler run that went to Universal . . . it might be an interesting thing 
to get some kind of a pop series on our list." 
</P>
<P>
 One special event Kimberling mentioned is the annual television Emmy Awards, 
currently held in September at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. James L. Loper, 
executive director of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, confirmed 
that the organization is perpetually looking for a site with more seats than 
the Pasadena Civic but not as many as, say, the ShrineAuditorium, and that it 
has several times opened discussions with the Music Center about using the 
Chandler. So far, he said, such talks have broken down because the Emmys need a 
full 10 days of set-up time and must be held in September because that's when 
the TV season begins. The opera season, Loper said, has always gotten in the 
way.  
</P>
<P>
 Without the need to schedule around the Philharmonic, Kimberling said, the 
Chandler could better accommodate its many December holiday programs. Among 
these are the obligatory annual "Nutcracker," usually performed by a visiting 
ballet company such as the Joffrey, the Kirov or American Ballet Theatre. With 
the new hall, there will be time available for an early "Nutcracker," which has 
not always been the case in recent years. " 'Nutcracker' notoriously doesn't 
sell well after the first of the year," Kimberling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also has its eye on a jazz series patterned after Lincoln Center's. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have Wynton Marsalis; they have a program every month, or every other 
month," Kimberling said. "We'd really like to do an East Coast-West Coast, 
'Lincoln Center Meets the Music Center' tie-in. We've got the other Marsalis 
(Branford, of "The Tonight Show" band) here, and we're going to work on that 
too. We did a jazz attempt a few years ago, but we just couldn't get the dates 
with any consistency." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling said that the Music Center Opera will not necessarily produce more 
operas in a given season but that it would be able to present more performances 
of each opera -- more cost-effective than setting up elaborate sets for 
productions that may play for only a few days. She added that the opera company 
would gain the ability to present opera throughout the year rather than during 
one crowded September-October season, and that it would also get a chance to 
produce musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thinking philosophically, a huge city like this must have a concert hall, 
separate from the opera house," offered the opera's Hemmings. "I think 
everybody agreed that the Chandler is a much better opera house than it is a 
concert hall. A concert hall needs to be a house without a proscenium -- a 
proscenium is anathema to orchestra sound. Concert halls should be completely 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in relatively small cities is the one building shared on a multipurpose 
basis. And so, at least, the building of Disney Hall indicates a distinct 
maturity. All great cities have an opera house and a concert hall. We are one 
of the last ones to be sharing -- and our time has come." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I am very pleased to know we will be the main tenants in the future 
. . . and I am therefore interested and concerned to know what it is going to 
be used for during the rest of the year. Because the less the theater is used, 
the more the onus is on us to cover (maintenance) costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemmings said the opera company currently presents eight or nine operas a year 
and that in 1997 it may be able to offer nine or 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with standard operas, we'll be able to do 10 performances instead of 
seven," he said. "We also think it is essential to spread our performances 
throughout the year, rather than doing them all in the same period; we think 
our subscribers prefer it. We aim toward doing an opera a month during the 
season, September through June, so the subscribers don't have to go too often." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemmings said extra performances for paying audiences could help offsets costs 
for more community outreach performances for students, senior citizens and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kimberling, Hemmings expressed some enthusiasm for musicals but noted 
that they would most likely be co-productions or the work of touring companies 
that would be presented by, rather than performed by, the opera. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on what you mean by a 'musical,' " Hemmings said. "Pieces like 
'Phantom of the Opera,' 'Sunset Boulevard,' 'Evita,' 'Cats' -- they all use 
microphones, which means the casting can be very different" from opera. "I 
don't think those pieces will ever be the meat of opera companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think pieces like 'Oklahoma!,' 'My Fair Lady,' 'South Pacific,' 
'Carousel' and of course the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces and pieces like 'The 
Merry Widow' and 'Die Fledermaus' . . . are done by opera companies. And the 
other way to do musicals is to buy into a circuit, as we did with 'Porgy and 
Bess.' I think an opera company is a perfectly logical organization to put on 
musicals, but we can't take any risks, because an opera company's duty is to 
put on an operatic repertoire each year. What I am hoping is that some sort of 
fund can be created to take the potential sting out of presenting musicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas plans for the opera are largely in place, the prognosis for dance at 
the Music Center is less certain. The Joffrey Ballet, the center's former 
resident company, lost its residency because of financial difficulties in 1991 
and has not been replaced with another company. Dance presentations since then 
have been sporadic, and plans to establish an active Music Center dance 
planning committee have been stalled time and again because of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling is enthusiastic about dance possibilities at both the Chandler 
Pavilion and the reconfigured Ahmanson. At the Ahmanson, she said, "we are 
removing the left stage wall. Right now, there are some dance companies that 
would showcase very nicely at the Ahmanson, but they can't leap offstage 
without smashing into a wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling and Disney Hall officials note that Disney Hall offers some 
opportunities for dance too. The concert stage could be used for modern dance 
companies that do not require fly space or suspended scenery, and Disney Hall 
will contain a small chamber concert space seating 600 that might be used for 
small-scale dance concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials, Hemmings among them, are less optimistic about dance at the 
Music Center -- particularly at the Ahmanson, which has already booked "Miss 
Saigon" for Jan. 25-Oct. 15, 1995, and will likely continue to play host to 
long-running shows in the future, leaving virtually no time available for 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dorothy Chandler presents a problem for dance because it's big . Its 
cavernous stage is suited only to big ballet companies -- and even they could 
only put on large-scale, showy story ballets such as "Swan Lake" or "Romeo and 
Juliet," not repertory programs. And "where are they going to come from?" 
Hemmings asked. "The problem is that all the American national dance companies 
are in great financial trouble and touring has become so expensive. The only 
thing on which they can make ends meet appears to be 'Nutcracker.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberling said most of the responsibility for selecting and scheduling 
performers for Disney Hall will fall to the Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Hall "is not the kind of place where you are going to book trade shows; 
it's designed for a real specialized audience," she said. "It's a concert hall. 
. . . They (the Philharmonic) have more expertise in that -- it's something 
they know more about, the classical artists and everything. We'll pick up the 
slack time, but the majority of (engagements) will come through the 
Philharmonic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic's executive vice president and managing director, Ernest 
Fleischmann, declines to speculate on what those offerings might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obviously concerned with what goes on in Disney Hall, but I am not in 
any position to tell anyone what it is going to be," he said. "Mr. Salonen 
(Music Director Esa-Pekka Salonen) and (artistic consultant) Peter Sellars and 
I are working on it. It is a . . . profound matter which I would say will have 
impact on the cultural life of this city; we take it extremely seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann stressed that each of the Music Center's resident companies has 
its own board of directors separate from the Music Center and that the Music 
Center, which is the center's fund-raising arm, provides less than 7% of the 
Philharmonic's operating costs. Therefore, he said, he is not concerned about 
any fears Music Center board members may have had about Disney Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad they are worrying on our behalf, but we are the ones carrying the 
ball," he said. "I wasn't afraid, nor was anyone connected with the 
Philharmonic. If they did not have confidence in us, it (Disney Hall) should 
never have been offered to us in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann called Disney Hall "complementary to, not competitive with, the 
Music Center." And he sees the separate facility as a way to cut, not increase, 
costs for the Philharmonic and the opera. "There is a tremendous reduction in 
stage costs" to be realized, he said. "At the moment . . . an opera set has to 
be taken down, and the orchestra has to be put up, all in a few hours, 
requiring legions of stage hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Center President Stanfill -- who took over in January after six years as 
president and chief executive officer of Virginia's Wolf Trap Foundation for 
the Performing Arts -- also sees more Chandler Pavilion open time as a boon. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many major things that have ended up at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center would have been naturals here had there been time available," he said. 
"It is quite possible for something like the Bolshoi Ballet, or the Kirov, to 
be in both places, without feeding off each other's audience. Those things 
didn't come here before, because there was no space, no time. It will be 
complex in terms of time and schedule, but at least it will be possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was at Wolf Trap, we were dealing with people like the Metropolitan 
Opera and the Spoleto Festival, and we were able to do it because they had the 
available talent and we had the right kind of space. The Music Center did not."

 DEADLINE POET: Or, My Life as a Doggerelist by Calvin Trillin. (Farrar, Straus 
& Giroux: $18; 196 pp.) Imagine persuading your boss (in Trillin's case, the 
"wily and parsimonious" Victor S. Navasky, editor of the Nation magazine) to 
let you write a poem a week on whatever piece of current events finds itself 
stuck in your craw. Sure, it took Trillin's agent, Robert (Slowly) Lescher, to 
work Navasky up to 100 bucks a poem, only because they were written on Sunday 
-- time and a half -- and only if Trillin promised not to "tell any of the real 
poets that he was getting that much." Since 1990, we the public have been 
blessed with Trillin's wisdom, beginning with the now-famous poem, "If You Knew 
What Sununu," moving on to David Duke (It's funny who you meet/By peeking 
'neath the sheet.), to Clarence Thomas in "The Supremes": Well, first they 
found a woman who's really not/so sure/Abortion's for a woman to decide./And 
then they got a black man who thinks that/Special help/For black folks should 
be canceled/countrywide./They're looking for a Jewish judge who really/sees the 
point/Of keeping jews away from one's resort./And then a smart Latino who'd 
like the border/closed./At last we'll have a truly balanced Court. Republicans 
are, in general, funnier to Trillin than the Democrats, and at times he seems 
to long for the Reagan era, or even Bush and Quayle ("In 1988 my suggestion 
that we pass a constitutional amendment making a C average a requirement for 
the presidency was widely viewed as an attack on Dan Quayle").Democrats he 
finds a little bland and ordinary: Clinton and Gore, Clinton and Gore -- /Both 
of them born since the war!/ . . . Baby boomers, baby boomers, yes, yes, 
yes./Both these guys know how to dress. But perhaps the most useful tool for 
measuring history that Trillin has given us thus far is the ML -- a unit of 
measurement equal to the combined theorizing of one panel discussion of 
specialists on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour."

 OLD SONGS IN A NEW CAFE by Robert James Waller. (Warner: $16.95; 172 pp.) I 
would rather have had Robert Waller give my college graduation speech (he could 
use the one printed in this collection under the name "Romance," given at 
University of Northern Iowa where he is dean of the School of Business) than 
the speaker we had -- Felix Rohatyn.Waller's not a bad writer; from these 
scraps of a memoir, he's a likable person, and he seems to want to be a regular 
guy, evidenced among other things by his use of the word cripes (the first time 
I have ever seen that word in print). But he is not the real thing. He is too 
self conscious ("In Big Sur, I read my poetry by firelight." Yuck!); he 
believes that "too much analysis of certain things removes the romance from 
them," a belief which never allows the holder to become an interesting person 
or a great writer; his characters, since they are only extensions of himself, 
do not stand on their own or have any bite at all; his sentiment is shallow 
(when a cat he loves dies, his wife says, "He was a good guy," and Waller 
writes, "I nodded and thought she had said it perfectly"); and his sentences, 
while they have some music in them, are not distinctive or particularly 
original. He's a Coke commercial, a passing fancy, a good cry. But none of this 
will stop you.

 OLEANDER, JACARANDA: A Childhood Perceived by Penelope Lively. HarperCollins: 
$20; 160 pp.) Lively believes that the experience of childhood is 
"irretrievable" ;all that remains is a "headful of brilliantly frozen 
moments."Born in Cairo in 1933, she was shipped back to England in the last 
year of the Second World War, losing her mother to divorce and her beloved 
nanny in the process. Aside from the fact that the frozen moments in this 
memoir sparkle beautifully, the glue that holds them together is the clear 
connection we as readers are able to make between Lively's 
post-Victorian/Edwardian upbringing, in which the motivations and 
rationalizations used by adults for their actions are completely hidden from 
their children, and what I take to be her sincere puzzlement over the 
irretrievability of childhood. Everything about her childhood is shrouded in a 
mystery created by convention. Relationships, like those between servants and 
children are "rich with ambiguities." "I am a hardheaded woman nowadays," 
writes Lively, in a passage describing her memory of a particular tree. 
"Nevertheless, there lurks within me somewhere the spirit of a person who once 
quite naturally and unquestioningly communed with a thirty-foot eucalyptus 
tree." She does not yearn, in these pages, for her inner child, but revels in 
what she calls the "discovery of concealed experience." To the modern American 
reader, this may be the most exotic thing about "Oleander, Jacaranda."

 AN UNSPOKEN HUNGER: Stories From the Field by Terry Tempest Williams. 
(Pantheon: $21; 160 pp.) Between Barry Lopez, Wallace Stegner, Jim Harrison, 
Susan Griffin and others, Terry Tempest Williams is in blurb heaven with this 
new book.Williams has influenced, cajoled, delighted, annoyed and mostly 
cracked open many, many readers. Very unlike another wonderful writer, Penelope 
Lively (reviewed above), there seems to be little standing between Williams and 
childhood -- its textures, its porous sensuality, its pure joy, its 
sentimentality and its instincts. Strangely like Virginia Woolf, Williams seems 
to live on the level of myth and symbol, and when she bumps into things, like 
shabby environmental legislation, nuclear testing, family members dying of 
cancer, she graces them with her compassion and her transforming imagination. 
This is a woman a sick planet would want to cozy up to. "A man or woman whose 
mind reins in the heart," she writes, "when the body sings desperately for 
connection can only expect more isolation and greater ecological disease." 
Sometimes we read to be drawn out of ourselves and sometimes, I think, to dive 
back in. Williams, somehow, gets us coming and going.

 AN ADIRONDACK PASSAGE: The Cruise of the Canoe Sairy Gamp by Christine Jerome. 
(HarperCollins: $20; 224 pp.) I like the idea that a few harried working people 
will pick up this book, obtain the notion that one can simply take off on a 
wacky canoe trip in imitation of an obscure writer/camper extraordinaire from 
the late 1800s, take the four weeks of vacation due and skip town. Like Jerome 
and her husband, they can be in their late 40s. They don't have to be rich or 
in great shape. They don't have to be rabid nature-lovers, irresponsible 
hippies, equipment-crazed yuppies, nerdy historian-types or environmental 
"agendarians." They might just go. In 1883, George Washington Sears (pen name 
Nessmuk), age 61, writer for Forest and Stream magazine, paddled and portaged 
his cedar-hulled, nine-foot, 10-pound, 8-ounce canoe 266 miles the length of 
the Adirondacks, from the southwest to the north-central part of the region. In 
1988, age 47, managing editor for New England Monthly magazine (a job she loses 
almost parenthetically during the trip) makes the same journey in a 10-pound 
canoe of similar design. "If you get sick of this as a canoe," the maker of the 
Sairy Gamp told Sears, "you can use it for a soap dish." There are no blinding 
revelations in the course of Jerome's journey, just some small triumphs over 
weather and physical discomfort, a sense of connection with Sears but mostly 
with the boat. As Sears put it during a night of camping in 
10-degrees-below-zero weather: And there may be a reason why I shun the blatant 
street,/To seek a distant mountain glen where three bright waters meet. /But 
why I shun the doors of men, their rooms alight and warm,/To camp in forest 
depths alone, or face a winter storm,/Or why the heart that gnaws itself will 
find relief in rhyme,/I cannot tell: I but abide the footing up of Time.

THREE ON THE TOWN: CITY OF OUT-OF-TOWNERS; L.A.'S CHARM REFLECTS THE 
BACKGROUNDS OF ITS RESIDENTS, MANY OF WHOM ARE IMPORTS

 If you grew up in Los Angeles, you are probably accustomed to sitting down to 
poker games with tablesful of Montanans, going to lunch counters that cater to 
the exact junk-food cravings of ex-Chicagoans, listening to Arizona State grads 
complain about the local Mexican food. When you go to rock clubs, you are 
surrounded by crowds of former Austin residents or onetime Parisians, who take 
great trouble to explain just why their hometowns are superior. And that 
doesn't even take into account the great swarms of New York guys who smirk 
about California's lack of night life, even as they stay home evenings with 
their cartons of takeout Chinese food and their taped "Seinfeld" episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more or less a rule of thumb in Los Angeles: When you are in a room with 
eight people, six of them will be from out of town, and one of the other two is 
lying. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Los Angeles in many ways is a more interesting restaurant city than 
New York or London, for example, owes less to the average Angeleno's 
cosmopolitanism than it does to the desire of homesick expatriates to reproduce 
exactly the tastes, the smells of their hometown. Here you can find the cooking 
not only of China, or even of metro Shanghai, but of Yangchow; a specific 
African-American style of tamales unique to a few Mississippi counties; the odd 
sour-sweet tang of fermented cactus drinks unknown outside a 10-mile radius of 
the proprietor's coastal Mexican hometown. Los Angeles sometimes seems less a 
place than a context. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland's vocal inflection is considered less an accent than standard 
American English. The local cooking is known to the world at large via 
McDonald's and Taco Bell. The home-grown entertainment, from the Stone Temple 
Pilots to "Terminator II," is the only stuff in the world never labeled as 
"regional." 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that you never feel so much an Angeleno as when you're someplace 
like Boston or Seattle, where "Los Angeles" is almost always shorthand for "too 
much money, not enough moral values," and where some people still insist on 
talking patronizingly about riots and earthquakes at dinner parties when they 
find out where you're from. Sometimes on the telephone to someplace like 
Brooklyn, you can inspire a small amount of envy by pointing out that the party 
on the other end is snowed in and where you are it's 75 degrees and you can see 
all the way out to Catalina. But it is safe to say that the phrase "she's so 
L.A." is rarely meant as a compliment, even around here. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the odd experience the other day of sitting down to dinner with eight 
people, seven of whom had actually grown up in Los Angeles, and we talked about 
the drive-ins we went to after high school basketball games, about visiting the 
old alligator farm in Buena Park, about going to see the giant wisteria in 
Sierra Madre when we were small. It was nice to have the same shared history as 
the other guys for a change, not the usual culture-centered conversations of X 
shows you might have seen together at the Whisky in 1979, Dodgers pennant 
seasons or the faded glory of the Giulini-era Philharmonic, but shared 
knowledge of dumb stuff: CIF football powerhouse St. Paul, the roadhouse shaped 
like Mt. Baldy, the giant baked potatoes down on old Route 19, early benders at 
Rosemead tiki lounges, the fries at the Shrimp Boat. Still, I doubt that 
anywhere in the world is there a place called Joe's Grill and Los Angeles Bar. 
And if there were, I have no idea what kind of bar it might be.

<P>
 Get set for the return of Hanna Barbera's super hero Space Ghost. This time 
around, however, instead of leading an all-cartoon adventure show, the intrepid 
adventurer hosts an irreverent talk fest a la "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Space Ghost: Coast to Coast combines live-action and animation, with real 
celebrity guests taped at a location convenient to them. Atlanta-based Ghost 
George Lowe (taking over for Gary Owens) phones his questions in to them. Space 
Ghost animation is added to the mix later. "We just have to make sure the 
guests are looking in the right direction," says Mike Lazzo, Cartoon Network 
programming executive. 
</P>
<P>
 On the premiere, diet guru Susan Powter, comedian Kevin Meaney and the Bee 
Gees will be guests of the animated Space Ghost accompanied by his TV band -- 
led by former archenemies Moltar and Zorak. 
</P>
<P>
 An upcoming "Gilligan's Island" tribute show will feature Bob Denver 
(Gilligan), Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) and Russell Johnson (The Professor). Future 
guests include Catherine Bach ("African Skies"), Ice and Tower of "American 
Gladiator," Ashley Judd, Timothy Leary and Judy Tenuta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Space Ghost is your basic super hero," says Lazzo, whose idea it was to bring 
the animated crime fighter back. The original cartoon ran on CBS from 1966 to 
1968 and returned on NBC in 1987-88. "He has many powers: a wrist-band ray gun, 
freeze rays, and his main power: the ability to go invisible." 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about Space Ghost is that he'll be returning at a time when 
heroes like X-Men and Batman are especially popular," Lazzo adds. "But here we 
have a hero working with his former enemies and there's a completely loopy, 
nutty spin, making something for both kids and their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Space Ghost: Coast to Coast" premieres Friday at 8-8:15 p.m. on the Cartoon 
Network. A three-hour marathon of the original cartoon will run beforehand from 
5 to 8 p.m. For ages 8 and up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Based on James Burke's 1970s series "Connections," Connections2 (Sunday 5-5:30 
a.m. and 9-9:30 p.m. Learning Channel) looks at the origins and unexpected 
relationships of modern life and technology. The show hopes to illustrate how 
change happens, knowledge increases and why innovation occurs -- and how they 
are are all linked. Some of the connections examined include the links among 
fertilizer, Italian cemeteries, safety matches and landing on the moon. Another 
connection to be explored: How the "secret of the universe" is connected with a 
medieval Buddhist tea ceremony. For ages 12 and up.

 In the Adventures in Wonderland special "Weed Shall Overcome" (Wednesday 
7:30-8 a.m. and 6:30-7 p.m. Disney), the Red Queen's plans for a new royal 
tennis court are delayed when the Walrus discovers a rare plant growing on the 
site. When it turns out that the little weed is actually the last of its kind, 
Wonderland's residents band together to persuade the reluctant Queen to save 
the poor plant from extinction. For ages 2 to 9.

<P>
 Five new episodes of Snowy River: The McGregor Saga (Saturday 6-7 p.m. Family 
Channel) begin with "The Hostage." The town's rapid growth causes progress and 
trouble. The drunken revelries on the streets of Paterson's Ridge prompt pastor 
Colin McGregor to offer a reward for information about the newly arrived 
moonshiners. Colin's daughter, Danni, is taken hostage by the moonshiners when 
their identities are disclosed. For ages 8 and up.

THEATER; THE 'BEAUTY' OF BROADWAY; DISNEY EYES THE FUTURE: IF THE STAGE VERSION 
OF 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' IS A HIT ON BROADWAY, 'ALADDIN' AND OTHERS ARE IN THE 
WINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Gary Beach was watching the movie "Beauty and the Beast" at Hollywood's 
El Capitan Theatre a few years ago when the Disney film's suave French 
candlestick, Lumiere, started singing "Be Our Guest." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why doesn't somebody write a part like this for me ?" Beach wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, somebody did. Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" opens on 
Broadway on April 18 with the animated film's score, songs and sentiment 
essentially intact. But this time around, Belle, the Beast and the Enchanted 
Objects -- including Beach as Lumiere -- are live. 
</P>
<P>
 Few films, animated or otherwise, have received the kind of encouragement to 
move onstage that "Beauty and the Beast" has. It won Oscars for both best score 
and best song, and film and theater critics alike compared it favorably to 
staged musicals. The New York Times' then-drama critic, Frank Rich, called the 
film's score "the best Broadway musical score of 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 Such remarks inspired Disney to take "Beauty" to Broadway. So, of course, did 
the film's phenomenal success. The feature, the first animated film to be 
nominated for a best picture Oscar, grossed $146 million domestically, another 
$200 million internationally. More than 22 million video units have been sold, 
and until it was topped by "Aladdin" -- now at more than 24 million -- "Beauty" 
was the best-selling video ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question was would it work as well onstage as on film? 
</P>
<P>
 "The creative team had to convince us that you could translate this onto the 
stage (and) keep the basic integrity of the work," says Disney Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer Michael D. Eisner. "It had to stand on its own but grow 
out of the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast" is surely the first Broadway show to be developed first 
as storyboards. As the musical took form, set designer Stan Meyer and his staff 
created 140 intricate black-and-white renderings. Many of them featured arrows 
to show the directions people, props or sets moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer counts 73 different settings in the final show, with 42 of them in the 
first act alone. The show, starring Susan Egan as Belle and Terrence Mann as 
the Beast, adds six songs, including one written originally for the film, as 
well as plenty of magic and special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The "tale as old as time" remains the classic fairy tale -- as interpreted by 
Disney. Sweet, adventurous Belle offers herself as a prisoner in place of her 
father, Maurice, when he is imprisoned by the Beast (who is, of course, an 
enchanted prince). Assisted by a household of servants who've been transformed 
into objects, and undeterred by her vain suitor Gaston, Belle eventually sees 
beneath the Beast's foul exterior, loves him and breaks the evil spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the people who bought all those movie tickets and videos buy theater 
tickets as well? Many already have. The show broke box-office records at 
Houston's Theatre Under the Stars, where it tried out before landing in New 
York, and it opens on Broadway with advance sales reportedly at more than $6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 That advance, however, is still far below that of "Miss Saigon," which had a 
London run to build interest and a record $37 million during two years of 
advance ticket sales; even "The Goodbye Girl," which closed after less than six 
months, opened to a $10-million advance last season. And with a budget that 
Eisner pegs at "under $12 million" -- a figure comparable to mounting "Sunset 
Boulevard" at Century City's Shubert Theatre -- "Beauty" is among the costliest 
shows ever to hit Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast" is also the first venture of Walt Disney Theatrical 
Productions Ltd., a new entity that could wind up transferring other Disney 
properties to the stage. Disney also recently signed preliminary agreements 
with the city and state of New York to restore and reopen Broadway's historic 
New Amsterdam Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate attention to "Beauty" has been considerable, Eisner concedes. He and 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, went to all major 
auditions and participated in so many creative sessions that director Robert 
Jess Roth personally bought Katzenberg a notebook to jot down suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner, who majored in theater in college and even wrote a few ("very 
sophomoric") plays there, readily acknowledges that he's been having a good 
time. But "fun," he makes clear, is just one reason for his own major 
involvement. "The image of our company is at stake here. We're going to the 
media capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of a "Beauty and the Beast" stage adaptation started soon after the film 
was released in fall, 1991. Eisner and Katzenberg called key staff people at 
Walt Disney Attractions, which oversees the company's worldwide entertainment 
projects, and asked them to appoint a creative team to look into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, Meyer and choreographer Matt West were assigned to the project. The 
three, all in their 30s, had each come to Disney with professional theater 
experience. At Disney they staged mini-musicals such as "Mickey's Nutcracker" 
and "Motorcar Madness" for theme parks and other Disney enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 They created a new adventure for Dick Tracy, for instance, around the time 
Disney released the film in 1990. Their biggest project before "Beauty and the 
Beast," the Dick Tracy mini-musical was designed for the Anaheim and Orlando 
parks, ran 30 minutes and cost more than$1 million. Learning about computerized 
scenery and other sophisticated staging, Roth says, "was good education for us 
and proved very useful now." 
</P>
<P>
 They had all seen "Beauty and the Beast" the day the film opened in Hollywood, 
driving in together from their homes in Long Beach. Assigned to investigate the 
film's stage potential, they went back to see it again in a Long Beach mall, 
and this time they took notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bundling up Linda Woolverton's film script, they went off to Las Vegas for one 
weekend, to Palm Springs for another. To refresh their memories, they'd stop in 
movie theaters to see the film again. Over the next several weeks, a basic 
stage structure evolved with songs, locations, possible entrances and exits. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun as doodles tossed off during an airplane flight, Meyer's sketches grew 
more and more formal. Eventually, they emerged as 140 storyboards done in 
quarter-inch scale on 11-by-17-inch boards (to fit a photocopier). While design 
sketches are common in the theater and can easily number in the dozens on a big 
show, rarely do they suggest stage directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt (the sketches) had to be totally clean and figured out, because 
Michael and Jeffrey were used to this scale of presentation," Meyer says. "We 
were trying to get them to say yes." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, Roth led a presentation to Disney executives in an Aspen, 
Colo., hotel conference room. They reviewed fabric swatches, costume sketches 
and a boy-as-teacup illusion. Then, narrating a slide show of the storyboards, 
Roth talked his listeners through the entire show. At the end of his 
presentation, Roth recalls, "Michael said, 'OK, we're going to do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Disney next brought the "Beauty" stage and film teams together at L.A.'s Four 
Seasons Hotel. Screenwriter Woolverton, who was called back from a Hawaiian 
vacation to attend the event, concedes that "it was a daunting prospect given 
the magic element and translating objects onstage." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a surprising prospect, however. Alan Menken and the late Howard 
Ashman created the hit musical "Little Shop of Horrors" before moving on to 
"The Little Mermaid" and "Beauty." Woolverton, who has a master's degree in 
theater for children, even ran her own children's theater for a while, and says 
the three would often talk about the theatricality of their film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, foolishly, that it would be more of a physical than storytelling 
problem," Woolverton says. "But when we really started working on it (in 
January, 1993) the prospect became much more a storytelling problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Just one scene wound up exactly the same as the film, she says, and it has 
been altered during previews. Characters changed as they became 
three-dimensional, and, Woolverton says, "the tone is different -- I wanted to 
expand the characters and put a little more sophisticated spin on them." 
</P>
<P>
 She heightened the chemistry between Beauty and the Beast "so we discover with 
them what they have in common." Their developing Tracy-Hepburn-style 
relationship existed in the film, Woolverton says, but is more apparent in the 
stage version. 
</P>
<P>
 Back is the song "Human Again" that Menken and Ashman wrote originally for the 
film, and composer Menken has said he tried to construct the show's five new 
songs from musical themes in the film so they would seem familiar. (The new 
songs have lyrics by Tim Rice, the British lyricist who also wrote lyrics for 
"Aladdin.") 
</P>
<P>
 That left the problem everyone worried about: how to portray the Enchanted 
Objects onstage. The creative team chose to suggest objects, Meyer says, rather 
than have them be objects. Beach, for instance, says he plays not a candlestick 
but "a man turning into a candlestick; my hands light up, and my feet look like 
the base of a huge candelabra." 
</P>
<P>
 Costumes help, since identities need to be clear for children as well as 
adults. To test themselves, the show's creators drew on what Roth calls the 
"Leah factor." Costume designer Ann Hould-Ward, who also designed costumes for 
"Into the Woods," has a 7-year-old daughter named Leah and, says Roth, "we 
wanted Leah to be able to look at sketches and say, 'That's Lumiere.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rock 'n' roll fan Roth also tapped rock concert-style lighting and theatrics 
for his show, studying the appearance and sexuality of rock stars for use in 
creating the stage's Beast. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the first act, when the Beast sings his lament "If I Can't Love 
Her," Meyer says, "the costume, setting and lighting all come together. The 
focus is totally on the Beast. He's like a rock star." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast" arrived in New York after 50 performances at Houston's 
Theatre Under the Stars. Eisner says the 3,000-seat arena was selected in part 
because it was far enough away from Los Angeles "to give the show room to 
breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly out of sight, out of mind, however. Eisner went to Houston 10 
times, he says, and figures he talked to Roth almost every day by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Roth, in turn, calls Eisner and Katzenberg "part of the creative 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd come watch the show, we'd go to a room at the theater, and they'd have 
lots of notes," he says. "Their involvement led to a lot of discussions about 
how to make things clearer; because they were not there every day, they had 
fresh eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Meyer disputes media reports that Roth was hired because he could be 
easily controlled by corporate brass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This production is really Robert Roth's production of 'Beauty and the Beast,' 
" Meyer says. "They didn't pick Rob to tell him what to do. (Eisner and 
Katzenberg) were involved, but they weren't in the rehearsal halls. . . . Rob 
is definitely not a puppet for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about staffing the stage show, Eisner talks company loyalty more than 
malleability: "We produce in the U.S. more live entertainment and spend more on 
our attractions than all of Broadway put together. . . . It seemed to me to do 
Broadway and not do it with our own people, people who worked with us, was 
unfair. It would be inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 It would also be more expensive, particularly with the major players generally 
selected for such big-budget musicals. Although Broadway veterans do appear 
backstage as well as onstage, the show's producer, director and set designer 
are making their Broadway debuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always believed in nurturing new people," Eisner says. "It is definitely 
an economic issue but not the overriding issue. The overriding issue is talent. 
The expensive part of putting on the show is putting on the show, not a few 
salaries. But if you have the talent and have seen (it) with your own eyes, why 
would you go to anyone else?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast" also represents a new corporate direction for Disney, 
one of the few Hollywood studios to resist previous Broadway involvement. Both 
Eisner and Katzenberg have long been interested in theater, as a business as 
well as an art form, and a confluence of factors finally made the timing right. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, says Eisner, he didn't want to divert corporate attention "towards 
something limited to one theater, extremely risky and, for a lot of people, a 
hobby." But as Eisner saw Disney profits climb in other areas, so did his 
appreciation of the enormous profits possible in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 He was watching composer-producer Andrew Lloyd Webber and mega-producer 
Cameron Mackintosh, Eisner says, "and the afterlife of some of their shows. If 
you can hit, it makes it economically viable for a big company. You can create 
content, or software, for future use as part of your inventory." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's Beast, Terrence Mann, received a Tony nomination playing Rum Tum 
Tugger in "Cats," and Disney has obviously noted the Mackintosh merchandising 
acumen that helped "Cats" hit $2 billion in worldwide grosses earlier this 
year. "Beauty" programs and cast albums were also ready during previews, very 
rare on Broadway, and already open in New York are Bloomingdale's 'Beauty & the 
Beast" shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is the show's sole Broadway producer, and Disney Theatrical producer 
Robert McTyre says Disney will "almost certainly" remain the sole producer on 
domestic tours. International touring will probably require local affiliates, 
McTyre adds, reporting interest already from such places as Australia, Mexico, 
England, Germany, Israel, Canada and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Disney stage ventures also seem likely, given both Disney's frequently 
expressed commitment to live entertainment and the company's planned 
restoration of New York's New Amsterdam Theatre. Terms call for Disney to 
contribute $8 million toward restoring the 91-year-old theater, the country's 
first major Art Nouveau building, plus take on a $21-million loan for the rest 
from the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Should final negotiations and construction go according to plan, the theater 
could reopen as early as fall, 1996. "Beauty and the Beast" plays Broadway's 
Palace Theatre, but McTyre says Disney hopes its next production will open the 
New Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed to name likely candidates, he mentions "Aladdin," "The Little Mermaid" 
and "Mary Poppins" (which has also been mentioned by Lloyd Webber as a possible 
future project), "not necessarily in that order." Like "Beauty," all three 
musicals won Oscars for best score and best song. And "Aladdin" has already 
topped "Beauty" in both film grosses and video sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney keeps turning out more potential stage fodder, of course. "The Lion 
King" opens this summer with music and lyrics by Elton John and Tim Rice, while 
Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz teamed for 1995's "Pocahontas" and "The 
Hunchback of Notre Dame." Also on the roster are Schwartz's "Fa Mulan," based 
on a Chinese folk tale, "Hercules," with songs by Menken and lyricist David 
Zippel, and a reteaming of John and Rice for "Aida." 
</P>
<P>
 Possible, too, are original musicals and dramas. Disney will also look to see 
what might be adapted for the screen, Eisner says, acknowledging even the 
possibility of a live-action film version of "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 And if "Beauty" is not a Broadway smash? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'd be pretty disappointed if it didn't work," Eisner says. "There 
was a standing ovation every night in Houston and every night here (in 
previews), and everybody calls and tells me they love it. If you get that kind 
of reaction in the movie business, it generally follows through after the 
opening. I would be surprised and shocked and re-evaluate my own sense of 
understanding the market. But I would still be committed to go forward."

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of America's fleet of B-17s, the Memphis Belle was a lumbering Flying 
Fortress based in England during World War II. By 1943, it had come through 24 
bombing missions over Nazi-occupied mainland Europe. Director William Wyler 
made a memorable documentary about the Belle, and in 1990 his daughter 
Catherine and David Puttnam produced the dramatized Memphis Belle (ABC Sunday 
at 9 p.m.) The film is loaded with old-fashioned values, but once off the 
ground its aerial warfare acquires a terrifying immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Risky Business (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.) is that funny 1983 comedy-fantasy about 
a young man (Tom Cruise) who, under the sway of seductive hooker Rebecca De 
Mornay, turns his suburban Chicago home into a brothel while his parents are 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Masquerade (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a sleek romantic thriller, a densely 
plotted affair about the yearning for money and for love. But director Bob 
Swaim saves his strongest ammunition for his leading character, a crippling 
rich young heiress, played by Meg Tilly, who does not take one false breath. 
Rob Lowe is well-cast as a suave stud who begins to feel the stirring of 
decency and love for the first time in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel and Ethan Coen's 1990 gangster picture Miller's Crossing (KTLA Thursday 
at 8 p.m.) is richly atmospheric and morally ambiguous, as a savvy mid-level 
hood (Gabriel Byrne) commences on a search for an underworld kingpin worthy of 
his allegiance. With Albert Finney and John Turturro. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Stone's 1988 Talk Radio (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) makes you laugh, makes 
you mad and keeps you on edge watching for killers in the shadows. Eric 
Bogosian stars in this savagely audacious movie of his play that dips into the 
dangerous games played by a performer and his audience. Bogosian's baiting 
call-in host offers listeners a stream of vituperation, abuse and sarcasm. In 
the process, we get a profile of society and its malcontents and the faceless 
voices broadcast by radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Kitchell's Berkeley in the Sixties (KCET Friday at 10:30 p.m.) is a 
superb, heartfelt 1990 documentary on student activism that is both inclusive 
and coherent, distilling the decade expertly. 
</P>
<P>
 Penelope Spheeris' The Boys Next Door (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a scary, 
incisive study of two high school seniors (Matthew Caulfield and Charlie Sheen) 
who go on a killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET's vintage Saturday night double feature presents "Our Miss Brooks" at 9 
and "Tiger Bay" at 10:30 p.m.

VIEWS ON SHALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the commentary by Tom Shales entitled "For Viewers Whose Eyes Need a 
Rest" (TV Times, March 27): You have shown that I am not alone in the 
abhorrence (and if I knew a stronger word I would use it) of the camera work 
imposed on a defenseless TV audience by the advertisers. Split-second flashes 
of brightly lighted scenes, swiftly panned images, deliberately skewed from the 
vertical, rapid zooming in and out -- all these and more make looking at the 
screen an unpleasant experience.I don't see how it could in any way enhance the 
sales of a product. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I am writing regarding Tom Shales' commentary on "The Road Home" (CBS) (TV 
Times, March 13): It is obvious that Mr. Shales didn't watch the premiere very 
closely, or he would have noticed there were four children, not three. As for 
Grandma's (Frances Sternhagen) "genteel" form of Alzheimer's, it sounds as if 
Mr. Shales thinks she should one day be healthy and the next day completely 
lose her faculties and be put in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm offended and insulted by Mr. Shales, who thinks "The Road Home" is "hokey" 
and "crap" and a "colossal crock." Personally, I enjoy this program with fine 
actors and I hope it continues.

 SARAJEVO: SURVIVAL GUIDE text by Miroslav Prstojevic, translated from the 
Serbo-Croatian by Aleksandra Wagner with Ellen Elias-Bursac, photographs by 
Zeljko Puljic (Workman: $10; 96 pp., paperback original). In this mordant 
spoof, the members of the artist's group FAMA juxtapose the blithely upbeat 
tone of a Michelin guide with the cruel realities of life under siege.In the 
section on "Drinking & Eating," the authors remark, "People are healthy, in 
spite of everything, for no one eats animal fat anymore, nor cheese -- meals 
are made without eggs, without milk, onions, meat, vegetables. We eat a 
precious mix of wild imagination." The stark color photographs show once-lovely 
buildings in ruins, blood literally flowing in cobblestone streets and people 
engaged in desperate efforts to obtain water, food and fuel. The royalties from 
this darkly funny portrait will be used to help the displaced children of 
Sarajevo and other cultural projects.

PALM LATITUDES: CLIQUES; DO NOT PASS GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kathleen Moloney 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you enter, the smell of coffee and a light veil of cigarette smoke fill the 
air. Nearly 100 people are crammed into a minimalist room no bigger than some 
Beverly Hills walk-in closets, paired off at the game tables, sitting on 
mismatched chairs. Yet the only sounds are the clicking of game pieces called 
stones and an occasional guttural grunt. 
</P>
<P>
 This is L.A. Baduk, a.k.a. the L.A. Go Club. Located on the second floor of a 
Western Boulevard mall in Koreatown, it's crowded with silent, serious men -- 
women are a rarity -- playing the 4,000-year-old Asian game called go. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Gary Choi describes go as "the most complicated board game in the world 
with very simple rules." Go, which Chinese legend says was invented by Emperor 
Yoa to hone the intellect of his slow-witted son, is played on a board divided 
by 19 horizontal and vertical lines that create 361 squares. Players take turns 
placing black or white stones on the intersections of the squares, and once 
they are in place they can't be moved. To capture an opponent's stone, you must 
surround it on all four sides with your own; the opponent's stone is then 
removed. Hence the Chinese name for the game, wei qi, which means "surrounding 
chess." Go is the game's Japanese name, while the Koreans call it baduk. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win," says Choi, "you need to always keep two separate eyes open and watch 
very careful and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 The game has always been popular in the Asian community, but lately, Choi 
says, his clientele is increasingly mixed. "Lots of (non-Asian) engineers, 
rocket types and professors," he says. "You know, the smart types." 
</P>
<P>
 He first opened his club, which is the oldest and one of the largest in the 
area, in the back of a Korean barbershop on the corner of Crenshaw and Olympic 
in 1972. Today, he gets as many as a thousand players a week who pay $5 to play 
at his club. Although the regulars claim the place on weekdays, the newly 
initiated fill it on weekends; lately, Choi has had to turn people away.  
</P>
<P>
 An accomplished player himself, Choi attends several U.S. tournaments every 
year. But the big bucks, he says, are in the professional tourneys held every 
four years in China; players there compete for days hoping to take home the 
million-dollar prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people play this game, maybe 250,000 players in the United States. It's 
a big part of Asian culture, but hundreds of Americans play, too. It rids you 
of all your mental disabilities and confusion." Kathleen Moloney

PALM LATITUDES: CREATURE FEATURE; A RAINBOW OF SNAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Tennesen

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fanciers of exotic pets have felt a bit frustrated lately: Tightened federal 
restrictions have made certain tropical fish and birds illegal and others very 
expensive. But Southern Californians have latched onto an indigenous 
alternative -- the rosy boa.The three- to five-foot-long snakes come in a 
rainbow of colors, or "phases," many named for local terrain -- bright orange 
stripes and a blue body (the Azusa phase) to long gold stripes on gray body 
(the Corona phase). 
</P>
<P>
 I met my friend Dave Morafka's new love, a rosy named Floyd. "What a cutie 
pie," he says, sticking his finger in the cage. It bites him. So much for 
requited romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Floyd's nonpoisonous, which is one of the reasons that ever since 
the state legalized the breeding of rosy boas last year, business has been 
booming. "Twenty years ago, people didn't know what they were," says Morafka. 
"Now half the pet shops in L.A. have them." 
</P>
<P>
 As snakes go, they're economical -- most cost about $50 and they only need one 
mouse a week. And, Floyd's love-bite notwithstanding, rosies are very friendly 
-- unlike many snakes, they like to be held. "They're real sensual," says 
Morafka, "real lap snakes." Michael Tennesen

COMMENTARY; WHY WON'T WE SIT STILL FOR AN HOUR OF DRAMA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE WERTS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How long is an hour? 
</P>
<P>
 Too long these days, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 At least when it comes to TV fiction. Prime time's hour slots are getting 
eaten up by newsmags, with 10 of 'em on the networks now and more to come. What 
does this mean for the future of television drama? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marcus-Nelson Murders" got me thinking about this. The 1973 TV movie got 
a recent network repeat (NBC), in a move of rare class and/or crass 
penny-pinching. Not only is "Marcus-Nelson" one of the medium's finest moments 
-- a thoughtful and gritty story of a crusading New York cop, written by Abby 
Mann -- but it's also the vehicle that introduced us to Telly Savalas' Theo 
Kojak, who in his subsequent CBS series evolved into one of TV's true icons. 
</P>
<P>
 But where is the "Kojak" series today, should you wish to peruse the 
lieutenant's continued handiwork? Well, Kojak is mostly marooned in satellite 
limbo, filling time on cable feeds of superstations whenever federal syndicated 
exclusivity rules require that competitive fare such as "Arsenio" be blacked 
out in distant markets. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not exactly showcase treatment for a TV classic. Dramas such as 
"Kojak" ought to be coddled in a loving home, like Nick at Nite -- but that TV 
Land preserve quickly stopped accepting hour residents after early experiments 
with "I Spy" and "Route 66" failed to flourish. Cable's Nostalgia TV shows 
several weeknight dramas ("Family," "Combat," "Ben Casey"), and we're grateful 
for their presence. But it's heartbreaking to see how most of TV Land treats 
these treasures of our TV heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are "77 Sunset Strip" and "The Defenders," "Mission: Impossible" and 
"Cagney & Lacey," "Miami Vice" and "Wiseguy"? If "F Troop" can have a home, why 
can't "Mannix"? 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious answer: Because most viewers won't sit still for it. We're barely 
in one place long enough to absorb the 22 minutes of "Married ... With 
Children," which asks absolutely nothing of our brain cells anyway. To sit 
down, and to pay attention? For two whole half-hours? 
</P>
<P>
 It's been 10 years since dramas were near the top of the ratings, and those 
were airhead offerings: "Dallas," "Dynasty" and "The A-Team." Only "NYPD Blue" 
gets any kind of a drama audience today, and it's sad to say that bare butts 
probably got most of those viewers in the tent to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Even "Hill Street Blues" never cracked Nielsen's Top 20. The networks' current 
experiment with family dramas offering "heart" -- "The Road Home" and "The 
Byrds of Paradise" -- isn't setting any records, either. "Dr. Quinn" may prove 
to be the fluke rather than the forerunner. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe one reason dramas aren't cutting it today is that we don't really 
know anymore how it's done. Comedy creators can soak up all the "I Love Lucy" 
and "Mary Tyler Moore" episodes they want. The greats are available to learn 
from. Not so with drama classics. 
</P>
<P>
 But some folks are starting to show the right respect. TNT is turning its 
attention to hour TV shows, adding "Kung Fu" and "The Wild Wild West." Other 
cable channels run drama classics at obscure times -- but at least they're on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours will never die out, of course. The industry doesn't have the depth or 
the money to fill network schedules completely with sitcoms. And we viewers 
really do need the occasional change of pace. But hour drama is evolving. 
"Northern Exposure" is really a 60-minute comedy. And for that matter, 
"Roseanne" sometimes behaves like a 30-minute drama with lots of laughs. The 
show often ends not on a joke but on a contemplative note. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe half-hour drama is the way for the genre to go. The Nostalgia Channel 
runs a sterling example of this: the late '60s cop chronicle "N.Y.P.D." And 
then there's "Peter Gunn," and "Have Gun, Will Travel," and "Room 222." 
</P>
<P>
 And, lest we forget: Rod Serling's "Twilight Zone." Some of television's 
greatest dramatic writing was wrapped up in 30 minutes.

 THE FIFTIES: A Women's Oral History by Brett Harvey (HarperPerennial: $12; 228 
pp.) . Free-lance journalist Brett Harvey spoke to 92 women about work, sex, 
marriage, politics, education and motherhood. A surprising number of the women 
felt they drifted through the key decisions in their lives, rather than 
consciously made them: It was easier to do what was expected than to fight the 
system. Some of their memories seem so remote, it's difficult to believe only 
40 years have a elapsed.

 BILL BRANDT: Photographs 1928-1983 edited with an introduction by Ian Jeffrey 
(Thames & Hudson: $24.95; 192 pp., paperback original). Born in Hamburg, Brandt 
studied with Man Ray in Paris, but became one of the foremost chroniclers of 
life in England, his adopted homeland. The dark, moody tone of his photographs, 
which echo the look of noir detective films, seem most effective in the images 
of people huddling in gritty shelters during the Blitz and the strikingly 
introspective portraits of writers and artists.

 FUNICULAR RAILWAYS: From Angels Flight to Shasta Springs by Joseph Campbell 
(Borden Publishing, 2623 San Fernando Road, Los Angeles, Calif. 90065: $5.50; 
86 pp., illustrated, paperback original). In this genial little book, Campbell 
reveals that more of these vanished railways existed than many Angelenos 
realize: In addition to Angels Flight, Court Flight ran in downtown L.A., 
another railway climbed Mt. Washington and a third ran on Santa Catalina. In 
Northern California, funiculars served mining and lumbering installations, 
carried tourists to scenic views and gave rise to the San Francisco cable cars. 
Illustrated with charming old photographs and postcards, this attractive book 
is marred only by some typographical errors.

COVER STORY; THE TRIALS OF LOVE; JUST WHEN COURTNEY LOVE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON 
HOLE AND HER CAREER, SHE CAN'T HELP WORRYING ABOUT HER HUSBAND, KURT COBAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This should be the happiest time of Courtney Love's life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Geffen Records releases the album that Love hopes will change her 
reputation from a curiosity to a respected artist. And she has just moved into 
a new lakefront house in Seattle with her husband, Kurt Cobain, and their 
19-month-old daughter, Frances Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 In the alternative-rock world, Love is known as a provocateur with shrewd 
media instincts and charisma -- a sort of underground Madonna (whose record 
company, coincidentally, once expressed interest in signing Love's band, Hole). 
</P>
<P>
 But the new album, "Live Through This" (see review, Page 72) is strong enough 
to break through the stereotypes. It's the boldest in a series of outstanding 
records written and sung by a new wave of gifted female artists. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Love suddenly break into sobs last week in a Beverly Hills hotel 
room, in her first interview since Cobain suffered a near-fatal drug overdose 
last month in Rome? 
</P>
<P>
 Love is haunted by the incident and the aftermath, and though she won't speak 
about them on the record, the rumors last week were nonstop: Cobain's band, 
Nirvana, has broken up . . . he has had another overdose . . . she has had an 
overdose . . . he has checked into a recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses and lights a cigarette. For once, the woman known for her biting 
sarcasm and savage wit in marathon interviews is speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 For all her cockiness, she now seems frightened and fragile. "Off the record," 
she says repeatedly before describing the tensions of recent weeks, mostly 
involving her concerns over her husband. She wonders how she can go on the road 
if he needs her in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Cobain's condition, Nirvana last week bowed out of headlining the 
summer's "Lollapalooza" festival, and the future of the group is in question. 
</P>
<P>
 'I don't care about 'Lollapalooza,' " Love says when asked about the 
situation. "I just don't ever want to see him on the floor like that again. . . 
. He was blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Love is so famous among journalists for her loquaciousness that the 
joke is that you don't have to worry about questions when you interview her -- 
just be sure you have lots of tape. 
</P>
<P>
 All that talk can turn you into a bore or a star, depending on the level of 
intelligence and wit -- and Love has both. Her conversation is peppered with 
the latest gossip and savage commentaries on pop culture, jumping from the 
profound to the frivolous without signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, she knows the art of being provocative. No wonder a film agent once 
described her as a cross between Madonna and Bette Midler -- a comparison she 
hated. 
</P>
<P>
 Until her husband's overdose in Rome, which caused her to suspend interviews, 
the San Francisco native looked forward to lots of talking this spring about 
the new album -- because she knows she has an album that proves she is no joke 
as a singer-songwriter and guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, Courtney Love smells like rock hype. Reviewers may be excited about 
her, but the rock audience may be skeptical of the credentials of someone who 
is more famous for her interviews and her spouse than for her music. Hole's 
debut album, on the small independent Caroline Records, sold only 60,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
 The band -- Love, guitarist Eric Erlandson, bassist Kristen M. Pfaff and 
drummer Patty Schemel -- is aware of the hurdles presented by its leader's 
celebrity status. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that pressure when we were recording," says Pfaff in a separate 
interview. "I think we all knew it had to be really good (to) get over the 
Courtney personality thing . . . the wife-of-the-rock-star thing and the 
girl-band thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The new album shows there is more to Love than an ability to titillate and 
amuse. It combines the naked intimacy of Leonard Cohen with the rock 
self-affirmation of Patti Smith. Rolling Stone labels it "excellent." Newsweek 
calls it a "bracing album shot through with real sadness and candor." Love, the 
magazine continues, "sounds like a young Chrissie Hynde, not Mrs. Kurt Cobain." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Love is confident the band will get a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the music and I think it will be heard," she says, lighting 
another in a parade of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But she acknowledges the skepticism -- and sure enough, there's a story in 
Love's endless well of anecdotes about her way of dealing with it. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hole got mostly glowing reviews when it previewed material from the 
album on a recent West Coast tour with the Lemonheads, she says the crowd in 
Vancouver, Canada, seemed more fascinated with her than with the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 3,000 people there and you could sense everyone talking while we 
were on stage," Love says. "You could feel this swirl of energy and talk . . . 
a group over there talking about what I'm wearing and a group over there saying 
something about me and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally about 15 minutes into the show, I just stop playing and go to the 
microphone. 'Oh, I get it. You guys don't know it's cool to like us yet.' I 
said, 'You know what? I'll just come back in six months when the word (gets up) 
to Canada. I know you are a little behind.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With that, she says, she walked off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Love has long been attracted by fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something that was interesting and rare," she says, rubbing her hand 
through her hair, with its peroxide blonde highlights and dark roots, as she 
sits in a chair in her suite's living room. "It was a challenge -- sort of hard 
to achieve, but not that hard." 
</P>
<P>
 She clearly enjoys being a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone likes to gossip about me," she says, pointing to a Macintosh 
computer that sits across the room in its packing container. "One of the 
reasons I got that is so I can read all the gossip about me on America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everytime I go over to my friend's house, I punch myself in and there'll be 
all this crazy stuff about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing appears to delight Love more than a good story -- and some of those 
she tells about her background are so good that you wonder if she isn't above 
fabricating a few to make her background more interesting. Didn't Dylan do 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, shouldn't a reporter be on guard when the subject includes this line 
on her album: 
</P>
<P>
 I lie and lie and lie.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the lyric, Love says teasingly, "It's just admitting that I can be 
dishonest, that I can be a liar." 
</P>
<P>
 With a smile that summarizes the contradictions in her personality, she adds, 
"At least I'm honest about that, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 But much of Love's past has been verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother is Linda Carroll, the therapist of Katherine Ann Power, the '60s 
radical who surrendered last year in connection with a murder/bank robbery 
after 23 years in hiding. Her father is Hank Harrison, a writer who authored 
some books on the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 She describes her parents as hippies and says that they were divorced when she 
was quite young. Her childhood travels took her from New Zealand to England to 
Oregon, where she lived in a tepee near Eugene. A photo on the back of the new 
CD shows a young, barefoot Love from that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing child star Tatum O'Neal win an Oscar for "Paper Moon" made her obsessed 
with show business at age 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Yeah, OK, that's cool,' and I started doing commercials and 
children's theater," she says, pouring a cup of tea. "I owned the Pacific 
Northwest when it came to the children's slot in radio jingles and 
voice-overs." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were dark times. She says she was in and out of foster homes in her 
early teens and was sent to a juvenile detention center after stealing a KISS 
T-shirt from a department store. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 15, Love had discovered rock 'n' roll, and began a journey that took her 
over the next decade from New York to San Francisco to Minneapolis in search of 
the right musical partnership. She hooked up briefly with the bands Faith No 
More and Babes in Toyland. Somewhere along the line, she appeared in Alex Cox's 
film "Straight to Hell." On the side, she danced in strip joints. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the '80s, Love was drained. She headed for Alaska, where she 
went into virtual isolation while she tried to figure out her future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was turning 24 and had been wanting to have a band since I was 15, 16 and I 
still hadn't succeeded," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Her vow was to move to Los Angeles to give rock one more try -- this time 
searching for her own inner voice as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of other young rock hopefuls each year, Love put an ad in the 
Recycler in June, 1989, looking for musicians who, like her, were interested in 
such bands as Big Black, the Stooges, Sonic Youth and Fleetwood Mac. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Erlandson, a guitarist who grew up in the same San Pedro neighborhood as 
Black Flag's Greg Ginn, responded to the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called me back about two weeks later and talked my ear off at 3 in the 
morning," he says in a separate interview. "I was pretty scared off right away 
when I first met her. She was kind of overbearing. But I sensed there was 
something I could bring to the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though she had that strong personality, I felt she needed some focus and 
discipline, which I had. I had a lot of patience. We played off each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Hole lineup made its stage debut three months later at Raji's in 
Hollywood, opening for the L.A. female quartet L7. 
</P>
<P>
 Erlandson didn't feel that the band was ready to play a club, but Love 
believed in learning in public, he says. She enjoyed the chaos and the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Things progressed fairly quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hole -- which then included Jill Emery on bass and Caroline Rue on drums -- 
released its debut album in 1991 on tiny Caroline Records.  
</P>
<P>
 The album downplayed the pop instincts of both Erlandson and Love, reaching 
instead for an aggression and Angst that was typical of the punk-influenced 
alternative scene at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told myself, 'I'm going into this level of anger that is going to be beyond 
wretched and I'm going to just spew it out,' " Love says. "I had some jangly 
songs at that time because I was a big fan of R.E.M. and Fleetwood Mac, but I 
just didn't use that sound. I kind of regret that now, but I was intimidated by 
the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 The pop press, especially in England, crowned Hole the Next Big Thing and the 
band's leader was flattered by all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, she was dating Cobain. When the superbly crafted tales of 
youthful alienation on Nirvana's breakthrough album "Nevermind" led critics to 
call Cobain the voice of a new rock generation, it set up Love as the Yoko Ono 
figure to Cobain's John Lennon -- someone who was perceived to have hooked on 
to a star. 
</P>
<P>
 But rumors of drug use led to a more troubling comparison: Love and Cobain as 
Generation X's Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nirvana got more popular, the rumors about the couple became more 
widespread. The most infamous moment was when Love was quoted in Vanity Fair as 
saying that she took heroin while pregnant with Frances. (Love insists she 
didn't know she was pregnant at the time). 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 interview with The Times, Cobain admitted using drugs, including 
heroin, but said that he was then drug-free. He made the announcement, he said, 
because he didn't want his daughter to be told by someone else that her parents 
were junkies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cobain had another reason for saying he was through with drugs: He and 
Love were privately battling attempts by a Los Angeles County agency, 
apparently alarmed by the Vanity Fair report, to take custody of their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple prevailed and the drug issue faded. Until Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Love had flown to Rome early last month to spend a few days with Cobain after 
he canceled part of a European concert tour because of illness. She woke in 
their hotel room to find him unconscious, having taken some of her prescription 
tranquilizers and alcohol, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was dead . . . legally dead," she says. "He was in a coma for 20 hours . . 
. on life support. They thought he was never going to come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the new album Love declares, "I don't believe in God," but the singer, who 
was raised a Catholic, purchased Rosary beads and prayed for her husband at the 
Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cobain came out of the coma, he was transferred to another hospital. The 
move attracted hordes of photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to prevent anyone from getting a ghoulish photo of him as he lay on the 
stretcher with tubes in his nose, Love kicked at a photographer who had a clear 
shot. Now she regrets it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish Kurt could have seen (a photo of himself) because if he had, he never 
would get into that situation again. . . . He has such a great gift. . . ." 
</P>

 Love has been talking nearly three hours now and she's trying to be 
optimistic. A copy of Hole's new CD sits on a table, near a Narcotics Anonymous 
handbook. Frances is in a room down the hall with a nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 Love speaks about the early reaction to the album . . . the news that the 
group may appear on "Saturday Night Live" next month . . . the start of a 
concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strain of recent weeks remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears well again in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking up the handbook, she says, "I accepted the fact I was a drug addict 
and I go to the (expletive) meetings and I chant (an outgrowth of her interest 
in Buddhism). I am aware I am not above it. I realize drugs can floor me." 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses to light another cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this should be the happiest time of my life -- and there have been 
moments (over the last year) where I felt that happiness," she says, wearing a 
soft pink sweater over her trademark baby-doll white dress. "But not now. I 
thought I went through a lot of hard times over the years, but this has been 
the hardest. . . ."

COVER STORY; WOMEN ROCKERS -- THE SOUND AND THE FURY; WHY FEMALE ARTISTS ARE 
FINALLY SMASHING THE NARROW CONFINES PREVIOUSLY SET FOR WOMEN IN ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, Lorraine Ali writes about pop music for Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I wanna be mesmerizing, too," sings Liz Phair in a declaration that 
symbolizes the ambitions of a new generation of women who have finally gained 
respect in male-dominated rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Phair's line is from her debut album, "Exile in Guyville," which was named the 
best album of 1993 in a poll of the nation's pop music critics -- defeating 
such young male rock giants as Nirvana and Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 Worlds away from Phair's folk-accented rock, the similarly acclaimed PJ Harvey 
unleashes cathartic torrents of flailing emotion that baffle MTV's Beavis and 
Butt-head. "This chick's weird," comments Butt-head, just before Harvey 
unleashes another guttural growl in the video for her song "50-Ft. Queenie." 
Her lyrics about menstruation and the power struggles of sex blend with her 
oddball dress -- everything from '50s-style bikinis to sequins and boas to a 
simple wrap of cellophane. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing the critical limelight with Phair and Harvey are the Breeders, an 
Ohio-based quartet that doesn't deal in confessional or cathartic works, but in 
an impressionistic, groove-conscious rock that is more likely to make Butt-head 
twist his tiny hips than drop his jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there have been women stars before in mainstream rock, they always 
seemed isolated figures cast in a strictly defined, specialized role: from the 
blues-mama force of Janis Joplin in the '60s to the poetic folk sentiments of 
Joni Mitchell in the '70s to the giddy exuberance of Cyndi Lauper in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a different story today. The critical breakthroughs of Phair and the 
others are noteworthy because they -- and dozens of other new female artists -- 
are smashing the narrow confines previously set for women in rock. The roles of 
disco diva, stealth seductress or rocker tomboy -- which correspond with the 
roles of Madonna, whore or girl next door -- don't even begin to cover the 
diverse appeal of today's multidimensional artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Women now can shun those ghettos, which stifled predecessors who might have 
had ideas just as creative. As a result, female artists making more challenging 
music have infiltrated rock from every angle, representing the many facets of 
their own personalities. They're coming in as individuals, and winning points 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be as if female was a genre in itself -- (whether) it was blues, 
rock or dance," says Nancy Jeffries, senior vice president of artist relations 
at Elektra Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started out in this business (in the late '70s), certain people 
at labels would say, 'Oh, we can't sign any more females because we already 
have three,' and each of those women would be doing something entirely 
different. It was a perception that if you had X number of females, you had 
enough. Now, I don't hear the percents." 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn McDonnell, a New York-based rock critic and a founding member of Strong 
Women in Music (SWIM), an activist group supporting women on all music-industry 
levels, agrees. "All these intelligent, strong, different women couldn't be 
squeezed into these molds, and popped out on their own," she says. "They're 
doing harder, more thoughtful and weirder music." 
</P>
<P>
 The new female bands, which now number in the hundreds, are climbing up the 
scales of commercial success. The pat sound of Whitney Houston still outsells 
groups like the Breeders, but the sheer number of bands and the strong critical 
support shows record companies that the parameters are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent labels have been more responsive in signing women at the start of 
the '90s, and are responsible for supporting a number of unorthodox women 
artists, including "riot grrrl" leaders Bikini Kill. The band was able to spawn 
a whole underground movement of radical feminism through a homemade fanzine and 
the tiny K label in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 But major labels, which have picked up acts such as Nirvana from small labels, 
are catching on. Following Hole's earlier move from Caroline to Geffen, 7 Year 
Bitch has just gone from tiny C/Z to Atlantic Records and Babes in Toyland from 
Twin/Tone to Warner Bros., among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Breeders are up over 800,000 (sales), and that signals a positive 
commercial response," Jeffries says. "The public reaction is definitely 
reflected in sales, and they're increasing." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of women artists alone now is too great to pass off as some hype or 
fad. Among the '90s contenders and their competing musical styles: the 
experimental hip-hop mutations of Luscious Jackson, the crushing rock of 7 Year 
Bitch, the surreal lilts and growls of Bjork, the trance hum of Stereolab, the 
gruff pop of Hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Others include Come, Scrawl, Tara Key, Cranberries, Me'Shell NdegeOcello, L7, 
Juliana Hatfield, Belly, Tori Amos, Spinanes, th Faith Healers, Ethyl Meatplow, 
Bratmobile, Sarah McLachlan, Kristin Hersh, Melissa Ferrick, Frente, the Muffs, 
Shonen Knife and Curve, not to mention hip-hop's Queen Latifah, Salt-N-Pepa and 
Yo-Yo. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Love, singer and guitarist of Hole says, "There's more baby-boomer 
and hippie children -- like, I'm one -- who are going to play more instruments. 
So this is just to be expected and it's gonna happen more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will more women continue to infiltrate rock, Liz Phair predicted in a 
Times interview last year, but they'll be coming in from even fresher angles. 
"I bet you a million bucks you're going to see more women doing it in offbeat 
ways, more so than men. I think that women are gonna find since there is no 
history, they can kind of rewrite it."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Names like the Runaways, Janis Joplin, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, X, Sonic 
Youth, the Raincoats, the Slits, X-Ray Specs and Bush Tetras will come up when 
asking women (and men) about their influences. But considering that rock has 
been thriving for nearly four decades now, that's a short list.  
</P>
<P>
 While the presence of strong women in rock in the '60s and early '70s was 
minimal, the late '70s found Patti Smith and the rise of punk rock to be more 
inviting to women, spawning such offbeat artists as Lydia Lunch, Siouxie Sioux, 
Alice Bag and Exene Cervenka. But one of the '80s' key underground movements, 
hard-core, largely excluded women from its testosterone-drenched stages. The 
more commercial "new wave" scene welcomed women -- if they were willing to fill 
goofy roles, as Cyndi Lauper did in "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" or Toni Basil 
with "Mickey." 
</P>
<P>
 The encroachment of spandex hard-rock was worse, using females as video-images 
sprawled half-naked on top of Lamborghinis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the '90s brought reactions against the preceding decade in the form of 
Babes in Toyland and Hole. They screamed full-bore, with no heed to prettiness 
or melody, kicking off the current slew of outspoken and daring bands.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was inevitable," says Selene Vigil, lead singer for Seattle's 7 Year 
Bitch, about today's wave of female bands. "Women aren't putting up with it 
anymore and they're stepping out. They're not doing what they should be doing, 
but rather what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffries puts it on an even broader sociological level. "It's changing but 
it's a matter of evolution. This is a worldwide, cultural, evolutionary thing 
because the suppression of women has been so historically universal. This is 
the musicians' expression of this particular period of human evolution." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one common factor other than gender between these bands, it's that 
they are offering a new viewpoint toward rock.  
</P>
<P>
 "In general, women see the world differently than men, and we're not all the 
same," says Jill Cunniff, 27, who shares the duties of producing, singing, and 
playing everything from bass to keyboard with the rest of the New York-based 
group Luscious Jackson. "Because we haven't been in a position of power in 
society, women have a really different perspective. It's a lot more sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honest female expression in any art form is refreshing because before it was 
usually filtered through men: 'This one's OK, this one isn't.' Women just look 
at things in less constricted ways and ignore genre boundaries. They are 
contributing a more fluid element to rock, and that's a good thing."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think women are contributing songs that are based in real life in an 
artistic way," says McDonnell, who alongside her involvement in SWIM is 
currently working on a book chronicling rock criticism by women. "These people 
are articulating their own thoughts and emotions when so much of alternative 
and pop is just ironic and obtuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Vigil: "It gives rock a little more emotion. That whole bad boy, rock 'n' 
roll image -- there are girls that are as nasty as the boys, but with the 
Breeders and PJ Harvey, the music's good and powerful, and there's a lot more 
of an emotional quality to it." 
</P>
<P>
 With more lyrical and musical honesty comes a more individualized look. 
Instead of men dressing up women to sell records, women have taken control of 
their own images and are marketing themselves more accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, everyone was so concerned with, 'What are they wearing?' " 
says Jeffries. "They all had to have a stylist. Now, everybody comes in as who 
they are."  
</P>
<P>
 "Women are not trying to be a formulated Motown thing," Vigil explains, "with 
whipped-up hairdos and tight dresses. They're doing their own thing and don't 
feel they have to be a Barbie doll or have a rock slut image." 
</P>
<P>
 While women are appearing more as themselves, McDonnell sees it causing 
confusion elsewhere in the industry. "PJ Harvey's album could have done a lot 
better, but I just don't think people know how to market a women like this." 
</P>
<P>
 There is still a lot of progress to be made if PJ Harvey, or her peers, are to 
be accepted by their record companies, let alone a larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to over-romanticize how well things are," warns McDonnell, 
"because most of these artists are not selling as much as the guys. Sexism is 
so entrenched in all levels of the industry, I still think there are gut 
reactions that are afraid of seeing women voice certain things, that are 
resistant to it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a certain kickback that can also be expected by men and women 
threatened by the increasing power of women -- in rock, and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get flak all the time," says Vigil, whose band plays an ultra-aggressive 
form of rock with brazen lyrics. "People can accept seeing an angry man a lot 
quicker than they can seeing an angry woman. It's like, 'These women must 
really hate men,' but do you ever hear that about an all-male band who rags 
about some girl in their song?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cunniff says, "I like funky beats, I like to dance and I like to hear 
inspirational lyrics that don't degrade me, so I'm really happy when women like 
our music. It's like a bonding thing that men can enjoy too."

 ALL THE LIVELONG DAY: The Meaning and Demeaning of Routine Work by Barbara 
Garson (Penguin: $11.95; 271 pp.). Garson interviewed workers at fish canneries 
and lumber mills and took jobs in banks and insurance companies for her 
examination of rote work.She emphasizes that virtually everyone she encountered 
wanted to work and generally worked hard, but surveillance and the increasingly 
narrow scope of each job often prevented them from doing so. In a newly revised 
edition of a study that initially appeared in 1975, Garson condemns the 
Orwellian electronic monitoring systems that are becoming common in offices. In 
a discussion of the human cost of the current emphasis on maximum, short-term 
profits, she comments, "There are no columns in standard double-entry 
bookkeeping to keep track of satisfaction and demoralization."

 ATLAS OF RUSSIAN HISTORY: From 800 B.C. to the Present Day by Martin Gilbert 
(Oxford University Press: $12.95; 161 pp.) . In this concise atlas, Gilbert 
uses the geography of the past to elucidate the present. The xenophobia of 
conservative Russian politicians becomes more comprehensible when the reader 
learns that between 1240 and 1942, virtually every part of the country endured 
at least one invasion, culminating in the German offensive of 1941-45, in which 
7.5 million Soviet soldiers and 3 million civilians perished. The maps showing 
Russian expansion into Poland and western Ukraine in the late 18th Century and 
into the Caucasus during the 19th Century help to explain the fragmentation of 
the former Soviet Union.

COVER STORY; THE 10 MOST LIKELY TO RULE GUYVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lorraine Ali 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here , listed alphabetically, are the female bands or musicians who are making 
-- or are on the verge of making -- the most impact in today's rock music : 
</P>
<P>
 Bikini Kill: As leaders of the "riot grrrl" movement, this Olympia, Wash., 
quartet's angry lyrics not only lash out against misogyny, chauvinism and 
violence, but attack the anti-feminine aspects of '70s feminism. Bikini Kill 
overaccentuates and even parodies girlishness -- from lunch pails and plastic 
kiddie barrettes to clipped hairdos and frumpy dresses to such gestures as 
scrawling slut across their bare midriffs. "These are my ruby red lips, the 
better to suck you dry/ These are my long, red nails, the better to scratch out 
your eyes," singer Kathleen Hanna rails in their second full independent album, 
"Pussy Whipped." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Breeders: The Breeders, headed by singer-guitarist Kim Deal (formerly of the 
Pixies), write and perform liquid, smooth pop songs that defy normality with a 
spacey, experimental edge. On the group's second album, "Last Splash," Deal and 
her twin sister, Kelley, top the songs with husky yet smooth harmonies that are 
both seductive and surreal. The lyrics are often nonsensical, used more for 
their sonic wordplay than to convey any particular thought. Kim's deep, breathy 
voice, like a post-punk Peggy Lee, gives the word sexy a new twist without even 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PJ Harvey: When Polly Jean Harvey hisses the words "Lick my legs, I'm on fire" 
in the title song of her critically acclaimed 1993 album "Rid of Me," she lays 
her emotions on a platter for all the world to see. Her words are raw, her 
Patti Smith-inspired vocal delivery dramatic and her backing music abrasive, 
minimal and arty. Harvey, who also plays guitar, creates an overall sound that 
is difficult, and the listener comes away disturbed by her intense outpourings. 
One of the few English women with such an individual and powerful style.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Juliana Hatfield: This MTV darling plays the familiar weak and waif-like role 
that women traditionally have been trapped in. On "Become What You Are," the 
26-year-old Boston native's major-label debut, she slides further into pop 
mediocrity, coming off as a wispy, doll-like creature with little to say. 
Though she's been marketed as an "alternative" act, she's more like a 
submissive pin-up in the tradition of the post-Go-Go's Belinda Carlisle.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Hersh: As the leader of Throwing Muses, Hersh started one of the most 
respected bands in the arty underground scene. On her solo debut, "Hips and 
Makers," Hersh proves her creativity can thrive outside the parameters of her 
old band. The Providence, R.I., native's intricate and often subdued tunes are 
unexpectedly powerful, and her crystalline vocals often pack more Angst than 
half of Seattle's grunge scene. Her unique style shows there is power in grace 
and subtlety.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hole: Hole has brains, guts, emotion and sensitivity. The quartet's new 
major-label debut, "Live Through This," features Courtney Love's sharp insight 
and wrenched feelings against music that's alternately driving and sullen, 
displaying the confusion Love has faced as a flamboyant and intelligent woman. 
After two years of scrutiny by the press for her turbulent lifestyle (she is 
married to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain) and brash philosophies, Love bursts wide open 
the boundaries of "acceptable, ladylike behavior."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L7: This L.A. quartet made it big with its 1992 major-label debut, "Bricks Are 
Heavy," and brought the issue of reproductive rights to a rock audience with 
its benefit concert series, "Rock for Choice." But beyond its politics, you 
never get a sense of who this band is. Its macho posturing suggests that the 
band views its gender as a weakness to be concealed. And the group's formerly 
rough and gritty sound has been toned down into traditional bad-girl pop; as a 
result, its original potential is smothered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luscious Jackson The group rose out of New York City's hard-core scene as a 
sort of post-punk hip-hop outfit in the vein of the Beastie Boys. Signed to the 
Beasties' Grand Royal label, the female quartet mixes distorted hip-hop beats 
and sings more than it raps. The group has gained attention with its debut 
album, "In Search of Manny," which establishes them as one of the only female 
bands to fuse bohemian rock and rap. This debut is often too laid-back and cool 
to ignite or throw sparks, but it shows potential. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Phair: On last year's debut album, "Exile in Guyville," Phair took the 
Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main Street," and twisted the album's macho posturing 
around on itself by inserting her own philosophies inside the classic album's 
song structures. The 27-year-old singer-songwriter's candid lyrics about sex 
and passsive-aggressive attitude are often taken as ironic by women and 
threatening but enticing by men. What's often overlooked is her witty portrayal 
of the everyday. Phair's subtle manipulation of her milk-and-honey looks also 
adds to the many contradictions that fuel her unassuming music and appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7 Year Bitch: One of the first all-female bands to break out of the largely 
male Seattle scene and stand on its own. Recently signed to Atlantic records, 7 
Year Bitch follows in the footsteps of the ultra-heavy and abrasive Babes in 
Toyland, but mixes the maniacal noise with the solid beat of bands such as 
AC/DC. Singer Selene Vigil's lyrics range from her personal experience with 
abortion to the pointed sentiment "dead men don't rape." Though hardly 
thinking-woman's rock, it carries a lot of impact. Lorraine Ali

 When Joseph Wambaugh decided to get a physical, some friends recommended Tom 
Cummings, a Pacific Beach family practitioner, albeit with unusual praise: 
"Wait till you see what a great drink he makes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued, the author went to see Dr. Tom, who, it turns out, bartends one 
night a week at Good Time Charlie's, a local watering hole."About 6 o'clock," 
says Wambaugh, "here he comes in, casually dressed, wearing baggy slacks, 
tennis shoes and a T-shirt. He runs his hand through his hair and I think, 
'This is my doctor?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sure is. Cummings, 41, is indulging an old hankering. "My college roommate was 
a bartender and I always envied his lifestyle," he recalls. "He'd sleep in, go 
to the beach and play Frisbee, come back and nap. And he met interesting 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 So when friend Charlie Somol opened his bar four years ago, Cummings got the 
chance to fulfill his dream. He's been known to dispense medical advice along 
with the scotch, rocks. In fact, Wambaugh got the results of some tests at the 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Tom is a great doctor," Wambaugh says. "He actually makes house calls, 
and puts medicine before money. And," he adds, "he makes a great vodka 
martini." Sharon Whitley

 Southern California arguably leads the world in publications devoted to 
helping people sell their used cars. The ads have their own special vocabulary, 
and understanding it is essential if one is to avoid getting lemon-ized.Hence:

<P>
 WHAT IT SAYS & WHAT IT MEANS 
</P>
<P>
 Must sell: Before it blows up. Runs fine: I was going to say "runs excellent" 
but I had a last-minute conscience attack. Needs some body work: Was blindsided 
by a Winnebago. Well maintained: I changed the oil occasionally. Looks like 
new: Just don't try to drive it anywhere. All original: I never had anything 
fixed, adjusted or replaced. Loaded with options: Each one more troublesome 
than the next. Never smoked in: Unfortunately, that's the best thing I can say 
about it. Project car: This car is trashed. Lots of potential: This car is 
trashed. Needs minor repair: This car is trashed. Steve Salerno

IT WASN'T GOD WHO MADE HONKY TONK ANGELS; BREAK THE HEART OF ME, BY ELIZABETH 
DEWBERRY VAUGHN (NAN A. TALESE / DOUBLEDAY: $20; 289 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Isaacs, Susan Isaacs is currently adapting her most recent novel, 
After All These Years, for the screen. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Familiarity breeds contempt, to say nothing of nausea. The daily atrocities of 
talk TV become ho-hum. Notions that ought to disturb or even horrify us -- 
sexual abuse, death from disease and suicide, religious fanaticism, bulimia, 
marital strife -- induce little more ennui. Snore City: another dysfunctional 
family, another four or five souls shrieking in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 But novelist/creating writing teacher Elizabeth Dewberry Vaughn's "Break the 
Heart of Me" is no mike-in-your-face presentation of all-American schmutz. 
Rather, it is a complex fiction that, ultimately, is more authentic than the 
televised truth that deadens our souls. There is no way we can keep our usual 
snooty distance from its brave and splendid narrator, hymn-singing country girl 
Sylvia Grace Mullins. She has suffered long -- and cruelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her travails begin before she is born, when her pregnant, 14-year-old mother 
falls into a coma after a car accident. After two months on life-support, her 
mother passes from the world at the time Sylvia comes into it. At age 12, 
Sylvia loses the beloved grandmother who raised her. With her cancer-riddled 
grandfather, Paw Paw, she is taken to Nashville by her father and step-mother. 
Soon after, she must also bear the loss of her first love, Bo Schifflett, Jr., 
an evangelical Christian who is convinced the Rapture is at hand. Bo is not 
your rockin', rolling', run-of-the-mill, teen heart-throb. There is no song in 
Bo's heart: 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bo) said the days of Tribulation were coming and the Communists were going 
to take over and they were going to burn all of our Bibles and make us read the 
Communist Manifesto, and they were going to turn our churches into Communist 
training grounds and brainwash our children . . . and we have to have the 
Bibles memorized so that when they burn them all up we could come back together 
and write it back down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started getting this panic spell, and I said Bo, couldn't we just hide 
some." 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene all the more horrifying because it is recounted by the low-key 
Sylvia, the fanatical Bo offers up his life (in a most grisly manner) to the 
imminent God who, Bo knows, will save him. God, apparently, has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia has to bear hurts more damaging than death. The name Paw Paw ought to 
belong to a lovable old Southern curmudgeon, but in fact the man is a monster 
who has abused her for years. Vaughn endows her narrator with the skill to 
recount the abuse so simply, yet in such a sickening, detailed and erotic 
manner, that the reader shares the torment Sylvia suffers. Her agony is not 
only due to physical pain or to mortification that the "medicine" her 
grandfather is giving her must be kept secret from her grandmother. That would 
be terrible enough, but added to that burden is the conflict between the 
enormity of Paw Paw's betrayal and Sylvia's own normal, suppressed sensual 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
 When at last she enters womanhood, there in no Prince Charming waiting to 
deliver her from drabness. At 23, Sylvia has virtually no magic in her life. No 
music either, even though she works as a secretary in the Sony entertainment 
empire. Her husband, 40-year-old Buddy, is not exactly a prince of a guy, 
appearing utterly satisfied being a traveling salesman of dry-walling and 
timber products. While she yearns to transcend what she sees as her 
ordinariness and to make music, to play her drums in a real band, write 
beautiful, heart-breaking songs she can record, all Buddy dreams of is a couple 
of cold beers. Sylvia observes: 
</P>
<P>
 "All his clothes smell like smoke. Somtimes Buddy's clothes, wrinkled pants 
with a 48-inch waist and a worn seat drenched in the state odor of old 
cigarettes -- it's just gross. I don't even like to wash our clothes in the 
same load." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being massively unattractive, Buddy is also monumentally insensitive. 
When Sylvia tells him of her newly-surfaced memory of abuse, his only comments 
are "Well, what do you want me to do about it" and "Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 Given this lack of plain old humanity, it is no wonder that Sylvia finds 
herself falling for Jake Harris, a sympathetic, good-looking country singer and 
composer with a recording contract who is poised to leap from simple 
recognition to out-and-out celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake would seem to be everything she wants in a man: courteous, responsive to 
her musical gift as well as to the potential pleasures of her flesh. He also 
arrives at either the best or the worst moment, when Sylvia finds herself 
coming apart as she tries to deal with her nightmare of a childhood -- being a 
victim of traumatic loss, incest, religious fanaticism -- as well as living in 
a joyless marriage. For Sylvia, however, cheating on Buddy (even with so dandy 
a dude as Jake) does not come easy. In her world, adultery is not mere "fooling 
around." It is an act with moral dimensions and with consequences. She can 
never be a detached 1990s dame with a handful of condoms in her pocketbook who 
cool-headedly weighs the credits and debits of any man she finds appealing. Her 
honesty makes her supremely vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sylvia is depicted with such authenticity, the reader is involved with 
her to the point of identification: It becomes vital to know what will become 
of her. Is Jake to be trusted? Could she possibly go back to Buddy? And can she 
ever, truly, transcend her past and find some music? 
</P>
<P>
 A writer as accomplished as Elizabeth Dewberry Vaughn (her first novel, "Many 
Things Have Happened Since He Died," was acclaimed for its artistry) should be 
able to create a universe so compelling, so richly textured, so full of 
unanswered questions that the reader should find his or her own world flat in 
comparison. Yet too often in "Break the Heart of Me," Vaughn stops playing God 
in her authorial cosmos and, instead, assumes human form -- cloaked in the 
robes of creative writing teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here that the writing becomes unconvincing. Sylvia is silenced and her 
Bible-Belt world is suddenly observed by an academic who appears to be always 
conscious of language, and of points to be gained by intellectual virtuosity. 
One example: It is not our much-loved narrator who goes on about fertilizing 
tulip and daffodil bulbs with bone. The author herself, aware of death imagery, 
breaks the mood she herself creates: 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt my bones turning into meal and I feel (Jake) ossify in my hand and I 
wonder if I really want to plant bones in my yard, like I live in a graveyard." 
</P>
<P>
 Ossify? This sort of reflection is far more literary and self-conscious than 
an intelligent but down-to-earth woman like Sylvia would ever be -- or would 
want to be. 
</P>
<P>
 So the novel isn't perfect. Big deal. In the long run, "Break the Heart of Me" 
is such an impressive work of fiction that its occasional lapses into "creative 
writing" cannot diminish its power. With amazing grace, Vaughn's story engages 
the mind -- even as its narrator captivates the heart.

A THING OF BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 Most of us take books and their easy availability for granted. Far fewer are 
aware of the book's centuries-long journey from dim notion to everyday object. 
It was a long while before the raw materials were even available. Paper, for 
instance. "Papermaking was invented in China in 100 AD," says publisher Allan 
Kornblum, founder of the Minneapolis-based Coffee House Press, "and traveled 
slowly from China to Tibet to India to Pakistan, across the Arabian 
subcontinent to North Africa, and then finally to Spain. It took a thousand 
years to get from China to Spain -- and another few hundred years to make its 
way through the rest of Europe." Once paper, ink and printing were realities, 
there were still greater obstacles to overcome. "Not too many people now know 
that Gutenberg went bankrupt," Kornblum points out, "or that during the Spanish 
Inquisition, offending printers and authors were tied together at the stake and 
burned, with their books used to start the blaze." Kornblum knows a great deal 
about the history of printing and bookmaking, and he has developed an 
entertaining hourlong presentation on the subject. A grant from the Lila 
Wallace-Reader's Digest Program enabled the 45-year old publisher to give his 
lectures in scores of venues around the country over the past year -- from a 
Minnesota saloon to the Library of Congress. The fourth and final stage of the 
tour will bring Kornblum to eight Southern California bookstores this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornblum wears a long denim apron and a leather visor when he gives his talk. 
An old-fashioned platen press, known as a "clamshell" or "jobber," serves as a 
visual aid. Spectators are invited to help print a broadside at the end of the 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation is intended to increase awareness of small presses -- like 
Kornblum's own literary Coffee House Press, begun in 1984 -- and to instill 
some knowledge of the traditions of fine printing. Although Kornblum is 
enthusiastic in principle about the rise of so-called "desktop publishing," he 
notes: "The new technology has led to such an easy access to bookmaking that 
people are starting to do it without any sense of its history, and there has in 
fact been a decline in standards." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Allan Kornblum's aims is to remind us what books should and can look 
like. At their best, they are still far from being everyday objects. "There are 
people today, in this country and others, doing unbelievably exciting work," 
the printer-publisher says. "Using handmade paper and metal type, utilizing 
ancient traditions and contemporary techniques, they're making books that are a 
tribute to the human spirit." Southern California Tour:

CHARLES BUKOWSKI, 1920-1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE LUMMIS, Suzanne Lummis is the founding director of the Los Angeles 
Poetry Festival. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A large gravelly head, deep-set eyes often hidden in shadow. This is either 
the head of some creature that staggered from its cave to tear Sinbad and his 
sailors limb from limb, or a profound and formidable visage that would look 
fine on Mount Rushmore alongside the other notables. 
</P>
<P>
 A face like that must give a man a sense of destiny. Los Angeles poet and 
fiction writer Charles Bukowski, who died of leukemia on March 9 at the age of 
73, managed to create a life worthy of his face. And he produced a voluminous 
body of work that documented that life in the underbelly of Los Angeles, tales 
of ribald exploits laced with self-deprecating humor. Prostitutes broke his 
heart. Beefy men beat him up in fights he usually started. And there were old 
men, too, in this urban landscape, generally "in four dollar rooms / looking 
for socks in dresser drawers / while standing in brown underwear . . . " (from 
"lack of almost everything"). 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski went by the alias Henry Chinaski in his fiction and by his own name 
in his poetry, but the boorish, half-endearing underdog persona never changed. 
It won him a folk hero status in the international literary underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski once wrote that style came from lack of pretension. Well, Bukowski 
had a little pretension, all that magnificent self-debasement, those public 
displays of excess. Yet he had a style anyway, a blunt, no-frills one, and it 
spawned a ton of imitators. 
</P>
<P>
 Wordsworth, Whitman, William Carlos Williams and The Beats in their respective 
generations moved poetry toward a more natural language. Bukowski moved it a 
little farther. He was never a university poets' poet but a populist voice, a 
Carl Sandburg for the down-and-out set. "I like desperate men, men with broken 
teeth and broken minds and broken ways," he wrote in his story, "Guts." "I also 
like vile women, drunk cursing bitches with loose stockings and sloppy mascara 
faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Sandburg, though, Bukowski never declared himself to be an ambassador 
of the people; that would have been too corny. He never declared himself to be 
anything except a hard drinker, a womanizer, a racetrack aficionado and above 
all -- absolutely above all -- a poet. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more thing: He declared himself to be Bukowski. His biographer Neeli 
Cherkovski recalls that Bukowski was fond of saying: "When I met Neeli he was 
16 and I was Bukowski." 
</P>
<P>
 When word of Bukowski's death got out, John Martin, Bukowski's editor at Black 
Sparrow Press in Santa Rosa, received calls from readers in Latin America, 
France, the Netherlands, all over, many of them crying. The owner of a coffee 
shop in Seattle called: "Someone's put a sign outside my place that says 
Charles Bukowski's dead. People are crying. Is it true?" 
</P>
<P>
 And here in Los Angeles, poets who liked him and those who didn't will 
remember for a long time where they were and what they were doing when they got 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, March 26, drivers passing the 8300 block of Beverly Boulevard 
must have wondered briefly at the rows of folding chairs on the sidewalk and 
the standing-room-only crowd gazing through the window of Arundel Antiquarian 
Books. KCRW had set up a microphone so that the overflow crowd could hear the 
Bukowski memorial addresses taking place inside. Several speakers recounted a 
similar experience: 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a poem on the radio and recognized it as Bukowski's, but it was an AM 
station. I thought, 'oh oh, this can't be good." (Bill Mohr) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Hawaii. I saw his name on the front page of the news with a 
photograph. I knew there was no Nobel Prize. I knew it was something dreadful." 
(Neeli Cherkovski) 
</P>
<P>
 Those who'd known him called him "Hank" or "Buk," and those who hadn't 
nevertheless felt as if they had. Though he'd been living rather reclusively in 
San Pedro with his wife and had not given a public reading for years, in 
literary L.A. his presence was keenly felt. He didn't hold out for prestigious 
publications; the most famous poet of the region published in everything, even 
homemade ventures, stapled, photocopied, lousy-looking things. As Charles Webb 
testified, one only had to ask and he'd send a bunch of poems with a note -- 
"Take what you need . . . Buk" -- and always a little doodle next to his name. 
Of course he could afford to; he turned out poems like one possessed or driven, 
as if that dog from hell noted in one of his titles was nipping at his heels. 
</P>
<P>
 There were anecdotes and laughter on this occasion, but Joan Jobe Smith 
altered the mood, suddenly putting down her book. "I don't want to read 
anything," she said quietly. "Charles Bukowski has left the building. Charles 
Bukowski has left L.A. Hail Bukowski." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hail Bukowski," said the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But although he had been writing about and imagining his death for 30 years, 
it seemed impossible that Charles could leave L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski was born in Germany on Aug. 16, 1920, and came to Los Angeles at age 
3. He had the kind of childhood that qualifies people to weep on all the 
afternoon talk shows. Brutal father, indifferent mother. In adolescence he 
broke out with terrible boils, which scarred his face and deepened his sense of 
isolation. (Much of that period is revealed in the novel "Ham On Rye.") Until 
he began to make a living from his writing at around age 50, he worked every 
odd job known to man or woman, in a dog biscuit factory, a New York subway, 
women's dress factories and meat-packing plants, on a track gang laying train 
tracks across the country, two days as a janitor at the L.A. Times, and 
finally, a job that lasted for a while -- at the Central Post Office. He 
commemorated that one in his first novel, "Post Office" (1971), a turning point 
for the writer who till then had only a tiny cult following as a poet. 
</P>
<P>
 Later he would write about those rough years honestly and sometimes 
humorously, but seldom with the raw vulnerability revealed in his more personal 
letters of the time. In September, 1962, Bukowski was bleeding from a 
drinking-related malady and suicidally depressed over the conditions of his 
life. Jane, the woman he is said never to have forgotten, had recently died of 
alcoholism. "Blood again this morning. And do you know it's ugly? Not the 
bright red that floats at the top. . . . They drained it out of my love when 
she died. She used to wear my torn yellow bathrobe and walk about the room. 
Plop, plop, plop, she walked like a simple child. And I loved her. I loved her 
from Armenia to the top of the sun, and now the yellow robe hangs in my closet 
and she's rotting in a grave. So I sit here in my triangle; madness, death by 
hemorrhage, and suicide. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He had little reason to believe at the time that 30 years down the line his 
collected letters, "Screams from the Balcony," would sell 10,000 copies in two 
days. (The letter to Jon Webb quoted above appears not in that collection but 
in Webb's 1960s magazine, The Outsider.) He didn't imagine that someday a 
famous actor named Mickey Rourke would give a comic, affectionate portrayal of 
him in a film called "Barfly" and that Faye Dunaway would play Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 The unguarded emotion in the letter is stunning, coming from one who later 
would insist on being perceived as a crusty anti-romantic. And it seems to 
contradict the charge that he didn't like women. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to say about Bukowski and women?" a woman called to ask me 
when she heard this article was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women have noted Bukowski's insensitive language -- he liked to talk 
dirty -- but this caller had a more serious complaint; she'd been shallowly 
characterized in one of his books. One must say this: He did not often draw his 
women characters with much depth or distinction. He did not often let his 
readers glimpse the Bukowski of Sept. 12, 1962. He was probably as leery of 
sentimentality as he was of self-pity. He did not always do much better by men. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to have felt something, though, for the women he kept crawling back 
to after they'd struck him down and left him for dead. Henry Chinaski is beaten 
up by more women than any man in Western literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Charles Bukowski was politically incorrect before some thinly 
talented radio personality made it the rage. He sported the grunge look before 
a Seattle band set the fashion. He predated the new appreciation of older 
women; he declared women are the most desirable at the age when they're just 
starting to fall apart, which is good news for some of us. He continued to 
drink hard liquor straight from the bottle long after imported water had 
replaced martinis on the social scene, and only the influence of a woman he 
loved, then married, was able to slow him down. He was a writer who insisted on 
being out-of-step with his times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing to realize about him," said John Martin, "is that he 
didn't want to go with any trends or join groups. Charles Bukowski stood 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Something else is important to know about him. He said of his typewriter, as 
Scott Wannberg recalled at the memorial: "It all begins and ends here. In the 
moment." His "typer" he called it, and it was the love of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski said: "The first thing writing must do is save your own ass." And so 
it did, for longer than he imagined it could. Writing, poetry: the mad dog 
nipping at his heels, and the wild horse running away over the hills. The 
Secret, by CHARLES BUKOWSKI

BOOM TIMES IN BANGKOK; THAILAND'S ECONOMIC SURGE, BASED ON JAPAN'S HIGH-TECH 
MODEL, HAS CREATED THE ULTIMATE FREE MARKET AND A GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE NEW ASIA 
COULD LOOK LIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FALLOWS, James Fallows is Washington editor of the Atlantic Monthly. 
This article is adapted from Looking at the Sun, to be published this month by 
Pantheon Books.

<TEXT>
<P>
 THE FIRST FEW TIMES I VISITED THAILAND I WAS NAGGED BY A SENSE OF familiarity 
that I could not quite pin down. It did not have to do with Thailand's sights 
and sounds -- the muddy klongs or canals of Bangkok, the gold-roofed temples 
throughout the country, the monks in orange robes who walked from house to 
house each morning carrying their begging bowls. These were all exotic to me 
but also quickly recognizable from books and movies I had seen over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of deja vu seemed to come instead from the speed with which nonstop 
economic growth was turning the whole society upside down. In Thailand, even 
more than in Japan during its boom years starting in the late 1980s, you could 
see and feel the way money was transforming life. Reconstruction in Japan tends 
to be quick and unobtrusive; it reminds me of a cat bathing itself. When my 
family was living in Japan during its bubble years of the late 1980s, when 
money practically pumped through the air, we would notice one day that a house 
on our street was covered with bamboo scaffolding. The next day the house would 
be gone, and in a week a new one would have sprung up in its place. Roads were 
repaired at night, as if by elves. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing subtle or hidden about the changes being worked on Thailand 
-- above all in Bangkok, where most of the country's industry is concentrated. 
On nights when the moon was down or was covered by fog, it seemed possible to 
read by the light of the welding torches that flickered all over town. One 
summer my family stayed in Bangkok for a month, in a 12th-floor apartment not 
far from downtown. We had to close the curtains at night against the 
electric-blue light that flickered round-the-clock from the condo that was 
rising, one floor per week, across the street. When dawn came, the night crews 
would climb down from the bamboo scaffolding. The workers had rags draped over 
their face to keep out the dust. Their eyes were visible as moist spots. I had 
seen this procession for several weeks before I noticed a worker remove the 
head-rags. She was a woman -- and so, I eventually discovered, were about half 
the other laborers on the high-rise. Along with the men, they had poured into 
Bangkok from Thailand's impoverished hinterland, known as the Northeast. At 
construction sites in the city they could earn as much as 100 baht per day, 
almost $4. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the face of progress in Southeast Asia, which through the past decade 
has contained most of the fastest-growing economies on earth. American 
discussions of the "Asian economic miracle" often begin and end with Japan, 
sometimes stretching to include Korea, Taiwan and the vast potential of China. 
Yet Southeast Asia -- Thailand and its neighbors along the border of the South 
China Sea -- now provides the most rapidly expanding markets and investment 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two years, when Japanese corporations faced stagnant demand at 
home, their near-dominance of markets in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and even 
Indochina kept them afloat. Even now, as economies recover in the United States 
and elsewhere in the industrialized world, the fastest expansion in demand for 
cars, computers and other advanced products is in the Southeast Asian countries 
that once made up Dai Toa Kyoeiken -- the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity 
Sphere, which was Imperial Japan's term for the rest of Asia. China's hopes for 
economic growth and political acceptance rest on Southeast Asia as well: The 
Chinese diaspora, composed of emigre Chinese who make up the business class of 
most Southeast Asian countries, builds markets for Chinese products and 
facilitates its trade with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 This region hums with an economic dynamism that the United States has not 
known for decades and Europe for more than a century. Society is being changed 
by the day -- made gentler and more comfortable in some cases, wrenched apart 
in others. Under this pressure, fundamental political and social tensions are 
emerging, including those that involve direct challenges to Western concepts of 
human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid growth of Southeast Asia, initiated by the outflow of capital and 
technology from Japan, is significant in its own right, as it remakes old 
societies. It is also significant for the rest of the world, because it 
represents the projection of models developed in Japan to an entire region. An 
economic system in a single country, even a country as economically large and 
significant as Japan, is by definition a limited phenomenon. A system that 
organizes hundreds of millions of people in a dozen countries is something 
else. Thailand, with its more than 57 million citizens, is at the moment the 
purest illustration of the causes and consequences of this kind of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS, BANGKOK HAS SEEMED LIKE A machine running so fast 
that gears and rods fly out in all directions and the lubricating oil smokes 
away. It is natural to think of smoke when you try to breathe in Bangkok. The 
air in Los Angeles does not seem opaque until you view it from a distance, 
looking toward an invisible mountain or out from an airplane sinking into the 
smog. After one of Bangkok's big, smoke-belching buses roars by, it can be hard 
even to see to the other side of the street. Smog is not the only problem. Only 
a generation ago, canals snaked through the entire city, and the broad and 
mighty Chao Phraya river was the symbolic heart of Bangkok. Now most of the 
canals have been paved and the Chao Phraya bobs with sewage and the pink 
plastic shopping bags that are the ubiquitous debris of the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangkok's sidewalks are also jammed, with Thai students, Western tourists and 
hippies, Japanese businessmen, peasants newly arrived from the provinces and 
the ever-present beggars and vendors. Outside the city's major Buddhist shrines 
sit women in front of cages packed with sparrow-like birds. For 30 baht, about 
a dollar, the vendors will open a box and let a bird go. This act of charity 
"makes merit" for the bird's benefactor, the customer, according to Buddhist 
teachings; the vendors are doing passersby a favor in offering this 
opportunity. Along with the birds, vendors offer turtles, which can be released 
into a pond in Bangkok's downtown Lumpini Park. Most of the turtles, 
unfortunately, are land tortoises, captured in the countryside and hauled by 
the basketful into the city. The lucky ones are recaptured within a few seconds 
of their liberation in the water by boys who return them to the merit-baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Beggar gangs present similar opportunities to make merit. The beggars in 
Bangkok are not as overwhelmingly numerous as those in Manila or New Delhi. Yet 
even as Thailand's economy has surged, visitors can find on its streets 
disabled children, pathetic mothers with grimy infants hanging at their 
breasts, blind flower-sellers and others with their hands out in supplication. 
The Thai government recently became so concerned about the beggars' effect on 
tourism that it began issuing notices in the English-language newspapers. Don't 
pay attention to the beggars, the announcement said. Don't feel sorry for them 
or believe their hard-luck tales. The saddest-looking children with the most 
pitiable disabilities are actually part of vast beggar gangs, the official 
warnings said. The gangs are run by evil beggar-bosses, the "Fagins of Bangkok" 
according to a newspaper account. 
</P>
<P>
 With the word Fagin, my nagging sense of familiarity was resolved. The 
Thailand of the 1990s does not resemble anything I had seen, but it does 
resemble something I had read about. The combination of rapid economic growth 
and chaotic social disorganization, the streets jammed with displaced country 
folk in search of jobs, the new factories obscured by smoke and dust, the 
material progress and consequent human suffering -- all these conditions were 
those of mid-19th-Century England as portrayed by Charles Dickens, who 
immortalized a metropolis going through the painful and messy birth of 
industrial life. 
</P>
<P>
 What is happening in Thailand now is ugly but not unprecedented. Today's 
richest countries, when they were growing fastest, were at least as raw and 
ruthless as Thailand seems now. In England, in North America, in Germany and 
elsewhere, modernization drove people from their farms and villages into 
tenements and factories. England lost its forests to the Industrial Revolution. 
America plowed up its prairie and drained its western aquifers. Each country 
used up people on its way toward industrialism, as Dickens and, later, Upton 
Sinclair chronicled. But when the dirty work was finished, the countries had 
become so prosperous that they could afford to outlaw child labor, impose 
safety laws, clean up their water and air. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that Thailand and its neighbors in Southeast Asia are in 
a messy period. Almost by the hour you can see the forests being mowed down. 
Social turmoil is so fast it is easy to feel old in a hurry. I was gone from 
the United States for most of four years; yet when I returned very few things 
made me think, "I don't recognize this place." When I visited Jakarta or 
Bangkok or Taipei after only six months, however, I found myself vainly looking 
for landmarks that had been razed, remodeled or transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 The question for Thailand and its neighbors is where today's disorder will 
lead and what the growth of a new Asian system will mean for them and for the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 IN A SENSE, THE ASIAN ECONOMIC ERA BEGAN LATE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, Sept. 22, 
1985. Early that day, the finance ministers and central-bank governors from the 
five major industrial powers had gathered at the Plaza Hotel in New York. For 
the preceding five years -- the "morning in America" phase of the Reagan 
presidency -- U.S. officials had promoted the line that a strong dollar meant a 
strong America. In February of 1985, it reached a high of 263 yen. But at this 
same time, with the trade deficit nearing $10 billion a month, the Reagan 
Administration started to believe that there could be such a thing as too 
strong a currency. With the dollar worth so much, American exporters couldn't 
compete, and American consumers were snapping up the suddenly bargain-priced 
cars and computers from overseas. The officials who gathered in New York that 
September orchestrated an increase in the yen's value against the dollar. Two 
years later, the dollar had lost more than half its value. Through most of 
1993, the dollar was worth less than 110 yen, 58% below its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The high yen was intended to make Japanese corporations less competitive 
worldwide. In self-defense, and taking advantage of the Japanese government's 
loose-money policy, the corporations poured money into new factories and 
production lines outside of Japan that might prevent their losing ground to 
foreigners. In the first five years of the high-yen era, Japanese corporations 
invested about $600 billion internationally in new factories and other 
productive capacities. At the time, Japan's economy was about half as large as 
America's, but in absolute terms, the Japanese firms invested more than 
U.S.-based corporations did. Most of the money that went overseas went to the 
United States. But the amount that flowed to the rest of Asia had an enormous 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Japanese firms were investing four times as much money in Taiwan as 
they had in 1985; five times as much in Malaysia; five times as much in South 
Korea; six times as much in Singapore, 15 times as much in Hong Kong, and 25 
times as much in Thailand. By 1990, Toshiba, Matsushita and similar Japanese 
firms had built more than 300 fully owned plants in Southeast Asia. The idea 
was not simply that machines once made in Osaka could be made instead in 
Bangkok and sold, more cheaply, to the same customers back in Japan. The 
concept was instead that these cheaper production sites could be incorporated, 
with the Japanese headquarters firms, into a system that could export to yet 
other countries (mainly to the United States). 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand, as the most attractive low-wage site for Japanese investors, became 
the showpiece for this strategy. Thailand's people had less of a chip on their 
shoulders about foreigners in their midst, including Japanese, than did most 
other Southeast Asians. Although Thai governments had accommodated European 
colonial powers, the country had never officially been colonized, and therefore 
lacked the complexities that twisted the Malaysians' dealings with Britain or 
the Filipinos' with the United States. Japan had long been the largest customer 
for Thailand's exports, mainly farm products and fish, which built gratitude 
among Thailand's businesses and government.  
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 Japanese lived in Thailand in the early 1980s; more than 25,000 
did by the end of the decade, and about 150,000 Thais worked for Japanese-owned 
firms. And as the money poured in, Thailand became a kind of mini-Japan. 
Japan's trade surplus with Thailand increased as it provided the machine tools, 
production equipment and advanced components for that country's growth. 
Thailand's surplus with the United States simultaneously grew as it sent more 
VCRs and light machines overseas. In 1989, American imports of Japanese-made 
consumer electronic products fell by about one-fifth. But at the same time, 
American imports of consumer-electronic goods from Thailand rose by 2,000%, 
virtually all of them from Japanese-owned factories in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened in Southeast Asia is the emergence of ersatz capitalism," 
Japanese scholar Kunio Yoshihara wrote in the late 1980s. He meant that the 
systems of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and other nations were being 
propelled, shaped, inflated and in countless ways changed by forces far beyond 
their control. As a result, he said, they were growing but not developing. 
Their cities were spreading, factories were sprouting up, their GNP figures 
were the envy of the world. Yet these economies did not seem to be gaining 
leverage and strength in the world. Modernization might not do for them what it 
had done for Japan -- increase their ability to control or steer the economic 
activity going on around them. Such control is what colonialism took away from 
most people in Asia, and it is what Japan has spent a century and a half 
fighting to attain. 
</P>
<P>
 Thai officials would reject the idea that their country's growth was in any 
way ersatz, or based on traits other than their own decisions and strengths. 
Thailand, according to Thais, has succeeded because Thailand is pleasant and 
attractive, making foreigners, especially Japanese businessmen, eager to work 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial fact about Thailand, according to this hypothesis, is that it is 
the sweet-dispositioned "land of smiles," the independent-spirited and 
playful-minded kingdom where nothing is taken too seriously and every 
interaction is greased with kindness, care and, above all, permissiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand's major industries -- textiles, mining, rice farming, tourism -- have 
been guided and controlled by the government, like most others in Asia, and 
through most of the 20th Century the military has been the dominant force in 
its government. Yet in many social mores, Thailand applies a brand of 
laissez-faire unimaginable in many other parts of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 When my family was living in Japan or Malaysia, we were shielded from the 
rough-and-tumble of a really free-market system. In Japan, everything cost too 
much. In Malaysia, things that were considered bad for us, from pornographic 
films to books critical of the country's government, were illegal. But whenever 
we went to Bangkok, we found that everything was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 I stepped into drugstores on Sukhumvit Road or Rama IV and bought all of the 
antibiotics, sleeping tablets and other products that my family thought it 
might need. Why bring a nosy doctor into it? In Thailand we could write 
prescriptions for ourselves. I could step outside the drugstore and buy a 
lifetime supply of Lacoste-style tennis shirts for less than $4. Sidewalk 
vendors carried pirated tapes, for $1, of whatever recordings were then popular 
in Europe or America. People could do what they wanted; it was the libertarian 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitution is theoretically against the law in Thailand, a fact that would 
surprise nearly any visitor and every resident. In any Thai village large 
enough to have a store or gas station, there is a brothel; in the big cities, 
there are hundreds. The Thai ministry of tourism periodically releases, without 
comment, statistics showing that most visitors to the kingdom are male, usually 
traveling on their own. Driving through the Thai countryside, far to the north 
or east of Bangkok, you will pass hundreds of bamboo or wooden huts -- and then 
all of a sudden you will see a concrete or brick structure with a real roof and 
perhaps a paved walkway. The parents who live in these houses almost always 
have a daughter who is working in Bangkok, Phuket or Pattaya and sending money 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, I interviewed an official of the Thai health ministry, who claimed 
that Asians would prove uniquely resistant to AIDS, despite Bangkok's enormous 
prostitution industry. By 1990, the health ministry was reporting that 
one-third of the Bangkok construction workers it tested were positive for HIV. 
Nonetheless, the prevailing Thai idea is that everything is OK, everyone can 
please himself. Mai pen rai.  
</P>
<P>
 Mai pen rai is Thailand's version of the cliche insight into the national 
character that becomes annoying in any country. What che sera, sera is supposed 
to be for the Italian soul or "I gotta be me" is for America, mai pen rai is 
for Thailand. The phrase variously means "Don't worry about it," "No problem," 
"Never mind" or "Oh, calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 Mai pen rai , I would hear from taxi drivers or Thai friends when sitting for 
hours in the traffic jams on Sukhumvit. Mai pen rai, in the sense of there's 
nothing to do about it, dominates the discussion of Thailand's severe 
environmental problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Like most cliches, the Thai emphasis on its open culture and the mai pen rai 
spirit obviously has something to it, yet like most cliches it omits certain 
crucial factors. The Thais' sense that their culture accounts for their success 
is certainly true in three areas: Thailand's freedom from the psychological 
aftereffects of colonialism, its relative success in racial integration and its 
adaptation of the monarchy to modern needs. What the cultural explanation omits 
are the economic fundamentals that have left this country, like most of its 
neighbors in Southeast Asia, dependent on decisions and events made by 
outsiders, especially in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 THROUGHOUT ASIA, THE MARK OF COLONIALISM REMAINS, PHYSICALLY and politically. 
Much of Hanoi looks like a provincial town in the south of France. When you 
ride through the hinterland of the Philippines and come over a rise to a small 
town, you will see the town hall, the public school and the basketball court, 
relics all of the American colonial age. 
</P>
<P>
 The political and cultural marks are harder to see, but more important. 
Japan's late-20th-Century industrial power is, in many ways, the legacy of its 
19th-Century determination to avoid becoming colonized. The politics of 
Malaysia revolve around racial issues left from the British colonial era. The 
main unifying force in Indonesia, a country that might otherwise fly apart 
because of geographic and ethnic divisions, is the sense of nationalism that 
came from rebelling against the Dutch. Part of China's brittleness in 
responding to Western pressure today is leftover resentment at its centuries of 
vulnerability to what it saw as upstart Western powers.  
</P>
<P>
 Thailand demonstrates the importance of colonialism in the opposite way. Just 
as Japanese theories of Japanese success always seem to begin with the phrase, 
"Because we are all Japanese," Thai explanations of how their country works 
begin, "Because we were never colonized." The very word thai, visitors are 
quickly told, means free . In its dealings with the outside world, therefore, 
Thailand need not display either the resentment or the leftover deference of a 
onetime colony, since it has never had to salute a foreign flag. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of strict historical fact, Thailand's emphasis on its unbroken 
liberty is not exactly true. Thailand avoided being conquered largely because 
its leaders shrewdly and preemptively cooperated whenever a superior force came 
in view. In the late 1800s, Thailand (then Siam) could look to the east and see 
the French colonies of Indochina. To the west lay the British occupiers in 
Burma, then part of the Indian raj. Thailand's rulers ingratiated themselves to 
each colonial power and survived as an independent buffer state. 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, during the Vietnam War years, Thailand's military rulers 
similarly ingratiated themselves to the United States. Vietnam and Thailand are 
old rivals in Southeast Asia, and Thailand had reasons of its own for wanting 
to contain Vietnam's expansion. So through the 1960s, it voluntarily made 
itself into a kind of American colony, with U.S. air bases throughout its 
eastern regions and hordes of GIs recreating in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
 In between these two episodes came World War II and Thailand's most dramatic 
preservation of its "independence." Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Thai 
politics centered on the rivalry of two men, named Pibul and Pridi. (Thai 
people are often referred to only by their first name.) Pibul was Thailand's 
prime minister late in 1941. On the eve of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the 
Japanese ambassador tried to track Pibul down in Bangkok with the formal 
request that Japanese troops be allowed free passage through Thailand as they 
moved against British positions to the west. Pibul avoided him by hiding in his 
office building. Pridi, then foreign minister, received the ambassador instead, 
and turned down his request. 
</P>
<P>
 As dawn broke the next day, with the Japanese army preparing to move across 
Thailand anyway, Pibul appeared and gave his OK to the Japanese. Through the 
following three years, until Allied forces began to roll the Japanese army back 
toward its home islands, Pibul served a quisling-like role as the Japanese 
puppet. Pridi left the government and organized a resistance movement, and when 
the Allies came back he was installed as prime minister.  
</P>
<P>
 The "alliance" with Japan during World War II required certain modifications 
in the mai pen rai approach. The Japanese theory of "pan-Asian brotherhood" 
resembled a real family mainly in that the members were not equals. The theory 
held that Japan had a responsibility for its little brothers throughout the 
region, but part of that burden was to make them shape up and modernize 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In Korea, Taiwan, China and other places where the Japanese had taken over by 
main force, the immediate task was to keep people under control. In Thailand, 
under the guise of alliance, Japanese officials could act as if they were 
providing etiquette tips. As British author Alec Waugh wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Japanese) pressed for Westernization. They found Pibul most cooperative. 
Orders were issued that women should wear gloves, hats and stockings. . . . The 
Japanese did not consider that the Thais showed sufficient respect to their 
wives, and it was decreed that when a man left his house in the morning and 
returned to it at night, he should bestow a kiss upon her cheek." 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand was naturally expected to declare war on the United States, but the 
Thai government never quite got around to this formality. Pibul's 
collaborationist government relayed instructions to its ambassador in 
Washington, telling him to present a formal declaration to the American 
authorities. The ambassador refused. By wartime's end he had become a major 
resistance leader.  
</P>
<P>
 This maneuvering gave Thailand two horses in World War II. Because of Japan's 
alliance with Thailand, the Japanese army did not have to invade in 1941, as it 
did in the Philippines and China. Because of the Thai resistance movement that 
had been sustained by prominent Thais outside the country, the Allies did not 
have to invade either. When they came they could be embraced as liberators. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the late 1980s, when nearly all the new money coming into Thailand 
seemed to be coming from Japan, there were signs that the "cover all bases" 
strategy was being applied again. On his visits to the United States, Thai 
Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan gave speeches urging a larger American 
presence in the region, so that his grandchildren didn't have to "grow up 
speaking Japanese." At the same time, inside Thailand, officials were 
increasingly solicitous of the visiting Japanese. When I interviewed 
politicians in Bangkok in 1989 and 1990 I would hear a constant refrain about 
Japan: "After all, we were allies in the war." As an American who lived in 
Thailand in the 1960s wrote, "The Thai always plant respected men in active 
cooperation with the publicly labeled enemy so that, no matter which side is 
victor in big power politics, a competent Thai is always in position to take 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 THAILAND HAS FREED ITSELF FROM ANOTHER FORM OF NASTINESS that prevails 
elsewhere in Southeast Asia: racial friction between Chinese minorities and the 
majority population.  
</P>
<P>
 The migrants who have fanned out from southern China since the 1500s 
constitute the largest diaspora in the world. The forebears of today's Chinese 
businessmen arrived in Southeast Asia as coolies to work in the great 
plantations of Java and Sumatra or as clerks and traders whose entry was 
encouraged by the British, French and Dutch colonialists. Like most emigrants, 
they were not from the elite class of their homeland, and they had the familiar 
immigrant drive to become established as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Established they now are: In virtually every great city of Southeast Asia, 
ethnic Chinese dominate business and finance. With bonds of language and family 
relations, Chinese merchants form a network that connects mainland Chinese, the 
mainly Chinese nations such as Singapore and Taiwan and the large Chinese 
enclaves in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Penang, Bangkok and even Ho Chi Minh 
City. In most parts of Southeast Asia, their conspicuous success is a 
significant political problem. Anti-Chinese feelings have reached explosive 
proportions in Indonesia, where the Chinese make up less than 3% of the 
population but account for perhaps 80% of all business activity. In 1965, huge 
numbers of ethnic Chinese were hacked to death by their fellow Indonesians in a 
months-long pogrom touched off by accusations that the Chinese were working as 
agents for the communist Chinese government. No one knows exactly how many 
people died during this slaughter; estimates run between 500,000 and 3 million. 
Similar, though less lurid, cases of anti-Chinese oppression have occurred in 
Burma (which the current regime calls Myanmar) and Vietnam. Malaysia's 
politics, though rarely violent, turn on little else except Malay-Chinese 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the situation in the neighboring countries, racial frictions in 
Thailand are mild. Thailand has solved its "Chinese problem" by acting as if 
the Chinese are actually Thai. Ethnic Chinese families are required to take 
Thai names from a government-approved list. These assigned names are easily 
identifiable, but Chinese Thai and ethnic Thai alike seem to have agreed to act 
as if they share a common nationality.  
</P>
<P>
 One evening in Bangkok, I went with my family to a Thai kick-boxing match. It 
was a strangely captivating spectacle, as two short, skinny, sinewy young Thais 
danced around each other in the ring -- really danced, since the fights were to 
the accompaniment of what Westerners would call snake-charmer music. A crowd 
numbering about a thousand was in the arena. My family and I, along with a 
Thai-speaking American friend, made about half the foreign contingent; the rest 
was a group of German students. 
</P>
<P>
 The real action in the stadium, we soon discovered, had no direct connection 
to the ring. People had come to gamble, and with each kick or gouge they waved 
new signals about odds or stakes as they searched for takers around the room. 
Except for us and the Germans, nearly everyone in the room was ethnically 
Chinese -- this was clear from their dress and manner and other details. Yet 
every word they spoke was in Thai. In almost any other part of Asia where so 
many Chinese gathered to gamble, the shouted odds would have been in Chinese; 
it was the most convincing testimony to assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
 ON MAY 21, 1992, AFTER THAILAND had undergone another of its frequent military 
coups, newspapers around the world published an extraordinary photo. It showed 
the king of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, dressed in a light, natty Western 
business suit and seated on a French-style sofa. The king wore aviator-style 
glasses, had his receding hair neatly combed back and generally looked as if he 
might be a still-sprightly professor of mathematics.  
</P>
<P>
 The other people in the picture were the two men who had been bitterly 
struggling for political control of the country: the prime minister, Suchinda 
Kraprayoon, a longtime soldier who had taken power in the coup, and Chamlong 
Srimuang, who had made his reputation as a Jerry Brown-style "shake up the 
system" candidate and had been jailed for his opposition to the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The two politicians were on the floor, sitting on the sides of their hips with 
their feet pointing away from the king and their heads leaning reverently 
toward him. This pose allowed them to avoid the two cardinal sins of etiquette 
in dealing with the king: pointing your feet toward him and allowing your own 
head to be higher than his. These two leaders, struggling to head the country's 
government, had entered the room on their knees. Such is the position of 
Thailand's king. 
</P>
<P>
 The reverence for the royal family in Thailand, both spontaneous and enforced, 
is impossible not to notice. Pictures of the king are everywhere, in every shop 
and office, in every restaurant and bathhouse. The most common shot is of him 
in standard, military-looking, ribbon-bedecked regalia. But often he is shown 
in an open-necked shirt and khaki trousers, tromping through city slums or in 
the forests as he visits his people. There are pictures of the king playing his 
clarinet with jazz orchestras, pictures of the king at the wheel of a sports 
car, pictures of the king behind an easel, painting dramatic landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the land of mai pen rai few things are forbidden. Exporting Buddha images 
is one and making negative comments about the royal family, in any form and 
with whatever justification, is another. Few people are even tempted to 
criticize the current king; the country apparently agrees that he comes as 
close to meriting adulation as a mortal can. The one controversial event in his 
reign occurred at its very beginning. In 1946, the king's older brother, who 
was then king, was shot to death under still-mysterious circumstances in the 
Royal Palace. Today's King Bhumibol, then a slight, weak-eyed boy of 19, took 
the throne.  
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, he has been a performer of seemingly endless good works -- opening 
dams, but opposing them when they would uproot too much of the forest; visiting 
the homeless and downtrodden but still lecturing on self-reliance; serving as 
patron of universities and of high-tech research. He has had exhibitions of his 
(surprisingly good) paintings and nature photographs; he ran a jazz radio 
station from the palace grounds and wrote some numbers produced by Mike Todd in 
the Broadway revue "Peepshow."  
</P>
<P>
 For more than four decades, the king has generally acted as the soul and 
conscience of his nation, a sentence I write with no irony at all. It was in 
this function that he summoned the feuding politicians to his feet in 1992, 
telling them to calm down and spare the country the effects of their violent 
quarrels. Nearly 20 years earlier, in 1973, when students rioted at 
universities and the military government cracked down, the king appointed a 
university regent as prime minister, a clear signal that he was tipping in 
favor of the democratic, anti-military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit of Thailand's emphasis on royalty, and in particular of this king, 
is that it and he have provided a living manifestation of such concepts as the 
public interest and the welfare of the nation. But this strategy creates one 
problem. If a good king has steered the country off the shoals so often, then a 
bad king could presumably do comparable harm. The great problem for Thailand is 
that King Bhumibol, despite his other virtues, will die some day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This king has been very instrumental in creating this system and legitimizing 
such steps toward democracy as we have," Kraisak Choonhavan told me in 1990. 
Kraisak was the son of the man who was then Thailand's prime minister, Chatchai 
Choonhavan. Kraisak had been a leftist professor but became a business 
consultant when his father rose to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The king has been a guiding figure in developing the legitimacy of state. But 
the idea that any king can build democracy is contradictory as a national 
ideology. If the democratic system had become strong enough, with its own 
ideological basis and legitimacy, then if we had a king who was not as 
outstanding, it wouldn't matter," he concluded. But the very virtues of this 
king have made the country more vulnerable to the liabilities of some future 
king. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Oriental people spiritually need leaders who are of royal rank," Kukrit 
Pramoj announced to me a few days later. Kukrit had been (briefly) his 
country's prime minister, a celebrated novelist and newspaper columnist and a 
matinee idol. Kukrit held court in a palace of his own, one in the old Thai 
style. This collection of teakwood buildings around a garden sat only a few 
hundred yards from one of Bangkok's main drags, Sathorn Thai.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want 'Mr. President,' " Kukrit said of his countrymen. "When 
Franklin Roosevelt was President, I thought America's President was 
heaven-sent. When Harry Truman became President, I said, 'This is democracy.' 
After Eisenhower, I have no opinion anymore. Anyone can be President. Countries 
are rather sad without kings." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters who are based in Bangkok, or who hope ever to return to Thailand, 
find it almost impossible to speculate in print about what may happen after the 
current king dies. In most of Asia, the press is more thoroughly controlled, 
through formal laws and informal self-censorship, than in North America or 
Western Europe. In Japan, the taboo subjects for the press mainly concern the 
imperial family and the untouchable, lower class of people known as burakumin. 
In Indonesia, the most important taboo covers the business dealings of 
President Suharto's family. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thailand, there is a lese-majeste clause of the country's criminal code, 
Section 112, which says that anyone who criticizes the king, heir apparent or 
regent faces between three and 15 years in jail. Even comments that aren't 
critical can be considered so. In 1987, a Thai politician was hauled up on 
Section 112 charges; his offense was to have said in a campaign speech that, 
given the choice, he'd rather have been born in the royal palace than have 
grown up tilling the soil. Foreigners in Bangkok live with the knowledge that 
the biggest offense that will get them kicked out of the country for good is to 
comment critically about the royal family.  
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the principal problem facing Thailand's royal system, the personal 
character of the heir apparent, is almost never discussed in print. The rumors 
surrounding the current crown prince involve his emotional volatility and 
physical brutality. Yet when I asked most politicians or journalists in 
Thailand about what would happen next, their eyes wandered, as if scanning the 
room for those who might overhear. It was the only time in my life in which I 
felt as if I'd entered a spy novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes to fly fighter planes and drive fast cars," one politician told me 
in 1990. "This is a dangerous life." He stared at me for about 15 seconds to be 
sure I had gotten the point. In 1980, the law of succession was changed to 
permit, in principle, a princess as well as a prince to inherit the throne. The 
king's daughter, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, rivals her father in 
belovedness. With luck, the country that relies on benevolent monarchs will 
find another one. 
</P>
<P>
 NOW SOUTHEAST ASIA JOINS the societies that have coped with the blessings and 
the curses of rapid economic growth. In England, Germany, the United States and 
Japan, the development of a capitalist business system has, over two centuries, 
increased each country's control over its surrounding world. Development gave 
these societies tools not simply for manipulating nature and generating 
material wealth, but also for projecting their values onto other cultures (in 
the case of Western powers) or defending their values against outsiders (in the 
case of Japan). 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand and its neighbors may not reap the rewards of development in quite 
the same way. Yet as all of East Asia has grown, the transfer and projection of 
values have also begun. One political consequence is the increased attention to 
collective "Asian" interests. The fissures that separate countries in East Asia 
are obvious and deep. Yet more and more politicians, businessmen and 
journalists talk in "Asian" terms. A generation ago, it would have been hard to 
imagine the prime minister of Malaysia -- a raw-material-producing, 
English-speaking, mainly Islamic country that was invaded by the emperor's 
troops during World War II -- finding any common ground with the Japanese. Yet 
in the 1990s, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohammed, has pushed for a 
pan-Asian economic grouping that would pointedly exclude Americans, Canadians, 
Australians and New Zealanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the success of Asian economies has begun to legitimize the idea of Asian 
politics. Feeling more confident on the world stage, believing that they have 
more interests in common, leaders from many Asian countries have begun arguing 
with their Western counterparts about whether universal definitions of 
democracy and human rights exist. Japanese officials say Americans are wrong to 
scold China about its political system, since this is a matter for each nation 
to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Thai military ousted Prime Minister Chatchai in 1991, most Western 
governments suspended their foreign aid programs and denounced this reversion 
to military rule. Japan announced that it recognized the new regime as a 
legitimate, constitutional government and would continue its foreign aid, which 
amounts to three times as much as aid from all other donors combined. In 
Thailand, as elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Japan's aid goes overwhelmingly to 
build roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure projects usually designed 
by Japanese architecture and engineering firms, built by Japanese construction 
companies and serving sites for Japanese-owned factories. The projects create 
jobs for Malaysians, Indonesians, Thais and other locals, but they also help 
bind together a Japan-centered industrial sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 During the nearly four decades in which the Liberal Democratic Party ruled 
Japan, politicians in Korea, Taiwan, China and elsewhere were studying Japan as 
a model for how, in the words of American scholar Gerald Curtis, "a country can 
have democracy and one-party rule at the same time." Even after the LDP lost 
its majority, the Japanese model remained more plausible than two-party 
democracies in Britain or America. Singapore has repeatedly banned or 
restricted foreign publications and has done so not apologetically, saying that 
the chaos of Western countries illustrates the harm a free press can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West approves the freedom of the press in India, frowns on the lack of it 
in China," Kishore Mahbubani, a senior official in Singapore's foreign 
ministry, wrote last year. "Yet which society is developing faster today and 
which society is likely to modernize first?" 
</P>
<P>
 The further that Asian economic development proceeds, the more important such 
political issues will become. The countries that border the western edge of the 
Pacific, despite their many variations, share historic experiences and 
intellectual precepts that differ from those prevailing in the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot line of modern history, as seen from the Asian perspective, involves 
Europeans and Americans with superior technology being able to tell Asians what 
to do. Most Asian societies were colonized by Western countries, and even the 
ones that weren't have been fully conscious of the West's dominance in 
machinery, technology and the flow of ideas. Like most of Latin America, Africa 
and the Middle East, societies in East Asia had no choice but to put up with 
this imbalance. The British, French and Americans were simply too rich and 
powerful to be held off. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's East Asia, unlike any other part of the once-colonized world, is 
beginning to redress the balance. In building semiconductor plants and aircraft 
factories, in striving to rely less on Western technology and make the Western 
world rely more on Asian technology, these Asian economies are acting for 
political as much as economic purposes. They are less interested than Americans 
in whether the rules of trade are fair or unfair. History has taught them that 
the most important difference is between the strong and the weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of these Asian societies have been washed in Western concepts 
for decades or centuries, the concepts largely remain imported. The ideal model 
toward which the Asian system is evolving differs from the Western ideal. It is 
more hierarchical, more divided in function by gender and ethnicity, more 
status-bound and more authoritarian than is advocated in most of the West. The 
economic success of such a system in Asia is what makes its modern interactions 
with the West so significant and interesting.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately we shall have to realize that this challenge encompasses not only 
Japan but China as well, and indeed the whole of East Asia," wrote American 
scholar Ivan Hall, who has lived for decades in Japan and other parts of Asia, 
"With poetic justice, we are now getting a tiny inkling of the intellectual and 
psychological anguish thrust upon those countries by the pressures from our 
more dynamic civilizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Not in 500 years has the Western world encountered a system that was based on 
deeply non-Western principles and that nonetheless worked. In an arc stretching 
from Sapporo, in far northern Japan, to Bangkok on its tropical plain, such a 
system is fast taking shape.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: IT'S PAT, IT'S SHORT, BUT 
JUST WHAT IS IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Pat -- or is it? It seems the fate of Touchstone Pictures' movie take on 
Julia Sweeney's sexually amorphic "Saturday Night Live" character is as 
nebulous as Pat his/herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources on the set say that Sweeney's one-gender-fits-all screen version, 
which is scheduled for a Sept. 2 release, has already been clipped to 76 
minutes -- with credits.  
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, the trailer (promoting the film) is longer than that! Maybe they should 
just show the trailer," says one source. The average length for a feature film 
falls somewhere between 90 minutes and 2 hours, without credits; credits 
usually roll for about five or six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Pat" is so short now that Touchstone has reportedly asked that another 
16 minutes be tacked back onto the picture. Compare that to such upcoming 
summer fare as Warner Bros.' "Wyatt Earp," which is three hours, or the 
two-hour "Maverick." 
</P>
<P>
 But a Disney spokeswoman says the rumors about the film are not true and that 
Disney is very hopeful about the picture's performance at the box office; she 
also pointed out that the hit "Airplane!" was only 76 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with 'Pat' is not Julia's performance," says one Disney source. 
"The problem is every scene is the same joke."  
</P>
<P>
 That joke being, what is Pat -- male or female? It's a joke that works pretty 
well in three-minute skits on "Saturday Night Live" but is stretched a bit thin 
over the course of a film. In "It's Pat," Sweeney's Pat is living with a crummy 
job until a mystery person named Chris comes into Pat's life, and they fall in 
love. Chris is as gender-amorphic as Pat, which stymies wedding plans until Pat 
figures out what, exactly, Chris is. There is a wedding -- the film's big 
climax -- but the film doesn't spill the sexual identity beans. The happy 
couple are reportedly wed in complementary muumuus. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Sweeney says that the film was always targeted for 80 minutes or 
under. "I was told it was 77. . . . We were joking the other day about how it 
would play in theaters : 'It's Pat.' Now showing at 1, 2:15, 3:30, 4:45. . . . 
Theaters ought to be thrilled. They can sell more popcorn with all of these 
extra showings!" 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Keitel, who had shot three or four scenes in one day, has been cut from 
the film, Sweeney says. "The rumor about cutting him out because a test 
audience hated it isn't true. What is true is I had to cut Harvey out and it 
killed me. He was playing a priest that Pat went to see for marriage 
counseling. But he was a priest on death row that should have been going to see 
Pat. It was a very funny device but it just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney says she hasn't had a chance to even tell Keitel about it yet. 
Co-starring with Keitel in Quentin Tarantino's upcoming "Pulp Fiction," Sweeney 
notes, "I had four scenes but I'm down to one now. Harvey's out of mine, now 
I'm out of his . . . almost!" 
</P>
<P>
 Also cut were early scenes of Pat's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the "one joke" criticism, Sweeney defends, "the first 15 minutes 
are pretty straight-on jokes about gender, but the rest of the movie is a look 
at what androgyny is really all about. For example, one of the neighbors falls 
in love with Pat, but is grappling with whether he's gay or not. It's much more 
than one joke." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she's sensitive about overexposure on the What Is Pat? joke. She 
hasn't played the character once this year on "SNL" because she didn't want to 
tire the audience before the movie's out. And she's only played Pat four times 
a year in the past three years. "I want to keep Pat as a quirky alternative. I 
want this to be the little movie that could." 
</P>
<P>
 So does she know what Pat really is? "Nope."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: MAGAZINE WITH A CAUSE; 
FEMME FATALES SAYS THERE'S MORE TO B-MOVIE ACTRESSES THAN, WELL, THEIR 
PHOTOGRAPHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY SPILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the casual observer, Femme Fatales magazine might just be another cleavage 
report from the Hollywood fringe, a girlie rag for males too young to buy 
Playboy or Penthouse. True, FF, a quarterly devoted to B-movie queens, is plump 
with pictures of scantily clad women staring open-mouthed into the camera.  
</P>
<P>
 But read the articles in the nearly 2-year-old sister publication to science 
fiction's Cinefantastique and a reader will discover babes of substance who 
seek escape from low-budget land as they rally against sexual exploitation and 
casting-couch abuses and voice dreams of true artistic satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Here straight-to-video vixens and stars of such films as "Jason Goes to Hell" 
and "Beach Babes From Beyond" bare their minds as well as their bodies, boldly 
stating such goals as, in the case of Shelley Michelle, "to be the next Bond 
girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent cover girl Monique Gabrielle, the busty blonde from "Amazon Women on 
the Moon" and "Emmanuelle V," declares, "I've learned to stand up for myself. 
It's tough being a woman in the entertainment business." Eyebrows of feminists 
might be raised at the placement of that quote opposite a photo of a nude 
Gabrielle sitting in water, hands coyly covering her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Femme Fatales' territory is the B-girl ghetto its editors claim was once 
inhabited by the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Ellen Barkin, Teri Garr and 
Ann-Margret, and currently includes such descending A-actresses as Karen Allen, 
Rosanna Arquette and Dee Wallace Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work is work," editor Bill George says. "A good B is better than a bad 
A-film." Still, one doubts that Michelle Pfeiffer, regardless of how tawdry her 
first film efforts, ever solicited video "dates" as Gabrielle and others do in 
Femme Fatales. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the magazine has its loopily endearing side, such as when it takes the 
trouble to track down teen-age stripper turned '70s drive-in diva Candice 
Rialson, or to exhume the career of "pioneering B queen" of the '50s Beverly 
Garland. And what other publication would stroke B junkies by calling Roger 
Corman "a consummate filmmaker"? 
</P>
<P>
 George, a film school grad himself, sees FF as a forum for young women -- 
albeit well-endowed ones -- to "talk about social issues. They're political in 
what they discuss. They say, 'I don't want (B-movies) to define me.' I think 
it's demonstrative of women who know they have to do this for a living but want 
to move on. Their dialogue contradicts those pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 The results fall somewhere between exploitative camp and feminist commentary. 
"From the outset we wanted to bait readers with those photos," George admits. 
"Certainly the photos are an incentive for people thumbing through it to say, 
'This looks hot, I've got to buy it.' But when they get it home and read it, 
they learn something about (the actresses') personalities. If you put them in a 
prom dress, nobody's going to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not known how many of the 50,000 mostly young male adults who purchase 
Femme Fatales actually read it. Staff writer Gary Garfinkel says that featured 
actresses benefit either way. "Industry people won't read all of Femmes 
Fatales. They'll look at the pictures, read the pull quotes. It's a nice way of 
bringing a resume and headshot to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lydie (pronounced liddy) Denier, star of Showtime's "Red Shoe Diaries," was 
concerned about appearing on Femme Fatales' winter cover. She had found Monique 
Gabrielle's cover, with the actress bursting through loose mummy wrappings, 
"ugly" and "disgusting." But Denier was happy with her shoot, a parody of 
Rolling Stone's recent Janet Jackson cover, this time with a pair of large 
monster claws covering her breasts. Denier considers a spread in FF good 
publicity. "It cannot hurt," the French actress says from her Sherman Oaks 
townhouse. "It's not like Playboy. Even if it is a very sexy photo, you cannot 
see anything. It didn't hurt Sharon Stone to do Playboy." 
</P>
<P>
 While they may not be readily apparent in the face of so many female 
appendages, Femme Fatales has its standards. "Our iron-clad rule is: No 
pictures of women in jeopardy," says associate editor and B-actress Debbie 
Rochon. "No one being threatened with guns or knives. No pictures of women with 
any blood on them, no women being in a victim situation, even though the movies 
they appear in may be contradictory to how we're presenting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even iron-clad rules are bent, however, as with the photo of a trussed up 
Catherine Oxenberg in "Lair of the White Worm." "It was so campy," Rochon 
insists, "it didn't count." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochon, 25, is described by her colleagues as the "feminist voice of Femme 
Fatales." But can the Vancouver native reconcile the often lascivious art with 
the allegedly enlightened editorial content? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be involved with T&A fest, but that's a likely way to 
describe it at this point," says Rochon, who just finished acting in "Abducted 
II." Like the B-actresses who aspire to be more, so Femme Fatales' creators 
claim that they wish to take the magazine to a higher plane. Rochon, who will 
be featured in an upcoming spread, would like to model the magazine on her 
favorite European publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very sexy -- they show women in a glamorous way, regardless of their 
age or breast size; they treat women like goddesses. They show women in 
control, so they don't look like they're expressing sexuality for a man -- 
they're doing it for themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "My frustration is that I don't personally want to celebrate women running 
around half nude," Rochon says. "Probably a lot of our readers don't want to 
hear that. That's what they enjoy. I want to move away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Garfinkel says he too would like more for Femme Fatales than a steady parade 
of temptresses. "I've been saying let's go to a better level of talent and more 
classy pictures, something other than women squeezing their arms together. That 
does nothing for me." After a brief pause, he admits, "Well, it does. But it's 
not the magazine I want to be writing for."

CRIME AND EMBELLISHMENT; THE RECENT HYSTERIA OVER FEAR AND CRIME IS BASED MORE 
ON MYTH AND MANIPULATION THAN TRUE DANGER AND DREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE DUNN, Katherine Dunn is working on her fourth novel; her most 
recent, Geek Love, was published by Alfred Knopf. She lives in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime is this year's designated crisis -- a lush opportunity for the Elected 
Ones to be especially eloquent, gnashing teeth and pounding podiums in their 
fervor to rain brimstone on all vile miscreants. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeble debate over prevention versus punishment is just for appearances, 
of course. Punishment is far more gratifying. Ignoring the impossibility of 
enforcing the laws already on the books, state after state foams up freshly 
recycled legal weapons against the enemy. The most recent anthem is "Three 
Strikes and You're Out," and only the storm crows squawk that nobody knows 
exactly what good these new laws will do, or what they will cost in money or 
misery or mess. The important thing is that we are, presumably at long last, 
getting tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson launches his reelection campaign by signing the nation's 
toughest sentencing law. Georgia proposes to one-up California by amending its 
state constitution to allow a "two-strike" policy. In the nation's capital, 
Democrats shed the "soft-on-crime" taint of liberalism to steal the "Dirty 
Harry" thunder from Republicans. The House tries to out-tough the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all in response to an alleged and loudly reported public outcry. The 
headlines scream fear: "Public Fear of Crime Rises!" "Besieged by Crime!" "Kids 
Growing Up Scared!" The pretext for this hysteria is simple. Those consulted 
for the most recent public polls on the nation's problems put crime at the top 
of the list. America is, we are told, a nation of locks and bolts, of sock 
drawers full of handguns, of children and old people hiding behind barred 
doors. Not a happy picture. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe not an accurate one. According to the surveys and the experts who 
study the public fear of crime, we're actually no more afraid than usual. The 
fear rates are high, but no higher than they have been for the past two 
decades.  
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the polls on the nation's problems swing back and forth -- 
economy, then crime. Sometimes there's a focus on a specific subcategory -- 
jobs, say, and then drugs, or the deficit trading places with gun control. But 
it's always either crime or the economy, and we did the economy during the last 
big election. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an election year. Since the economy doesn't look quite so bleak 
lately, the politicians have decided to plump for crime, and the news folk jump 
in gleefully because, as crises go, both the public and the press infinitely 
prefer crime. Crime is entertaining. Violence is exciting. Part of our unique 
American identity is the fact that we are the most violent and crime-ridden 
First World nation on the planet.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter what we claim in polls or anywhere else, Americans don't just hate 
and fear crime. Most of us are also devoted to it. I confess: I help keep the 
TV ratings high for all those gratuitously violent programs. I buy tickets for 
big-screen ballistics and am mesmerized by two-dimensional smashing, slashing 
and gore. I inhale stacks of paperbacks about ornate rackets, bizarre murders 
and hard-boiled mysteries. Conflict is the core of art, and the human 
inclination to monkey with the social contract is a bang-up plot device. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, I belong to that demographic group -- white females -- that fears 
crime most and is least likely to be victimized by it. Still, as an aficionado 
of violence, a crime fan, I have decided, with deep reluctance and regret, that 
much of what I and millions of others believe about this electric topic is raw 
hooey. 
</P>
<P>
 This embarrassing revelation was a result of the winter siege of crime-wave 
headlines. While the hysteria mounted on front pages, cryptic reports from the 
FBI and the Justice Department, buried deep in the sober sections, announced 
that the national crime rate fell slightly last year and has been remarkably 
level for almost 20 years. The direct contrast of a level and drooping crime 
rate with the "rising fear" headlines reeked of rat.  
</P>
<P>
 I called Gary Perlstein, a criminologist at Portland State University, to ask 
why, if crime was down slightly and fear was level, the headlines were spouting 
panic. Perlstein laughed. "There's a book you should look at," he said. "I use 
it in my classes. It will tell you what you want to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Reading "The Mythology of Crime and Criminal Justice" was the most deflating 
experience of my crime-fan career. A smallish 1993 paperback, the book was 
written, and exhaustively referenced, by three criminologists, Victor E. 
Kappeler and Gary W. Potter of Eastern Kentucky University, and Mark Blumberg 
of Central Missouri State University. In their research, the authors reviewed 
and analyzed hundreds of studies of crime and the justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Their basic conclusions go something like this: Though America has major, 
long-term crime problems, the public understanding of crime is clouded by 
politically and commercially powered fantasy. The hard life-and-death, 
fear-and-loss data that should guide our personal and public decisions 
regarding crime is often manipulated and sometimes downright deceptive. 
Politicians and governmental agencies, special-interest groups and the news 
media itself twist, exaggerate and occasionally fabricate information until it 
is no more connected to reality than the bogyman tales of childhood. Some of 
this deception is cold-blooded exploitation, and some is committed with 
passionate good intentions. But the result afflicts our lives with unnecessary 
fear and in some cases actually prevents a practical solution of the profound 
problems they disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fictions aren't new, but with modern communications systems they are much 
more powerful and widespread than they ever were in the limited days of 
word-of-mouth. Inevitably, the news media are the main mythmongers. Sometimes 
the news actually creates a myth by reporting a rare incident as if it were 
common. More often, the media swallow and spread propaganda dished out by 
special-interest groups and, most effectively, by government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Government, the criminologists explain, has a vested interest in defining 
crime and spreading the definition to include any groups or behaviors that "are 
perceived to be a threat to the existing social order."Like any other organism, 
government's first interest is preserving and expanding its own power. While 
individuals can certainly make strenuous efforts to guide things in a more 
sensible way, the weight of the system, the organic chemistry of government, 
makes it very difficult for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Genuine crime and violence are certainly things to fear. But neither hysteria 
nor garlic can protect us from them. If we are to make any progress in reducing 
crime rates, we need to separate myth from reality.  
</P>
<P>
 I SHOULD HAVE STARTED CATCHING ON IN THE '70s, when we all were stunned by 
reports of legions of Halloween sadists who poison treats, sprinkle cookies 
with ground glass and razor-load chocolates for handing out to innocent 
trick-or-treaters. As we all know too well, terrible things can and do happen 
to children, and our "kid" buttons are hot-wired to emotion. But this 
particular horror story was mostly fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sheehan, director of communications for the National Confectioners Assn., 
says there has never been a verified incident of Halloween candy tampering. Not 
one incident that led to illness or injury, much less death. Yet many hospitals 
still provide free X-ray exams of Halloween candy. Parents (I among them) rifle 
the booty, tossing out anything homemade, everything that isn't commercially 
sealed. Our national fear spawned those big bags of individually wrapped, 
bite-size candy bars. Every year, the local news sources announce cautionary 
lists of dos and don'ts. Whole communities have abandoned the door-to-door 
ritual in favor of costume parties and haunted-house fund-raisers. In 1982, a 
national Halloween Hotline was established, sponsored by the candy industry and 
the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police. Charlie Higginbotham of the 
chiefs' group says he thinks he's one of few who ever dial the number anymore; 
he calls each year to make sure it's working.  
</P>
<P>
 Parties do minimize the accidents that happen when masks with small eye-holes 
slip and kids trip over trailing costumes in the dark, and trick-or-treating is 
not exactly a major loss to the culture. Still, I'm ashamed of the way I 
treated the old couple in the next block who tried for years to give the local 
children beautiful, homemade caramel apples. 
</P>
<P>
 I should have also suspected something when the missing children campaign 
began in the early '80s. Sparked by the abduction and murder of little Adam 
Walsh in Florida, it pushed the ultimate kid button. The horrifying story of 
Adam's death, and the subsequent well-intentioned efforts by his father, John, 
to prevent similar tragedies exploded into a national myth that had maniacally 
perverted strangers kidnaping, abusing and murdering anywhere from 800,000 to 
1.2 million American kids each year. TV movies chronicled the tragic tales. 
Keene-eyed children staring from milk cartons had me pricing a leash for my 
grade-schooler and scaring him daily with warnings about "weirdos." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Denver Post won a Pulitzer for a series of articles that ran in May, 
1985, revealing the truth about missing children. According to the Post, as 
much as 95% were runaway teens. A portion had been taken by divorced parents in 
custody disputes. A tiny fraction of the reported numbers were actually lost or 
stolen children. Current reports indicate a fluctuating rate of 50 to 150 
actual abductions by strangers per year since the late '70s. Even with the 
three tragic and highly publicized cases in California and Missouri, the 1993 
numbers are expected to be on the low end. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Warr, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Austin who 
specializes in the study of fear of crime, encountered the effects of this myth 
personally. "Several years ago, when one of my children was in elementary 
school," he says, "the police came by and wanted each of the kids to 
participate in this program where they put an ID number on the teeth of the 
children. This was a national program. And the point was, if you're ever 
abducted and murdered, we can identify your body. Now what in hell are we doing 
to the children of the United States, teaching them something like that? The 
probability of being abducted and murdered is less than one in a million, 
literally. And yet we're scaring the hell out of thousands and thousands of our 
kids. So some of the things people do out of fear are very harmful. To me it's 
even questionable whether parents ought to ingrain in their children a fear of 
strangers. What happens is we end up with a society in which nobody trusts each 
other. " 
</P>
<P>
 The miserable truth is that most murdered children are killed by their 
parents. The bulk of child abuse and molestation is committed by family members 
or friends. In the era that discovered the pathology of the family, parents and 
law enforcement agencies all over the country stampeded for the red-herring 
stranger myth. Many still believe it; it's much easier to fear an invisible 
monster in the bushes than to worry about the very people you love and lean on. 
Maybe it's less painful to think your child has been kidnaped than to accept 
the guilt for the abuse that drove him or her away. And while any action that 
saves a child's life is worthy, blind panic doesn't help anyone.  
</P>
<P>
 Once your eyes adjust to detect camouflage, you find it in strange places. 
Why, for example, do the media consistently accept the rape statistics offered 
by victim-advocacy groups? The usual claim is that one out of every four 
American women will be raped during her lifetime. This statement is regularly 
delivered as fact in every form of news. Yet these numbers are disputed by most 
authorities. Rape statistics vary widely depending on who's doing the research, 
and all the results are currently in doubt. The Bureau of Justice Statistics 
1989 National Crime Survey, which includes crimes not reported to the police as 
well as those that are reported, finds that about 8% of American women will be 
victimized by rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. Feminist author Rene 
Denfeld devotes an entire chapter to challenging the one-in-four claims in her 
forthcoming book, "The New Victorians." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do these terrifying statistics come from, and what are they based on? 
Not from government figures or reliable studies, nor are they based on legal 
definitions of sexual assault. In fact, they come from just two surveys done by 
separate feminist researchers, Diana E.H. Russell and Mary P. Koss. Their 
surveys . . . are fraught with scientific flaws. Russell and Koss have included 
everything from consensual sex to obscene phone calls in their figures on rape 
and sexual abuse. Their numbers have little to do with what most people call 
rape." As Denfeld points out, broadening the definition of rape to such 
extremes trivializes and obscures the real victims of what is a vicious and 
terrifying crime. It also inflates the statistics grotesquely. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from feminist groups, the national survey rape questions were 
revised and made more specific in 1992. The first results of the revision won't 
be out until this fall. The criminologist who helped design the rape questions 
for the national survey was fear researcher Mark Warr. His work reveals that, 
not surprisingly, rape is the crime women under the age of 35 fear most. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked his opinion about the numbers. "I am very much on the low end," he 
said. "Which is to say that from the National Crime Survey, we find the 
probability per year for a woman is on the order of one in a thousand. I'm 
certainly willing to admit that there is undercounting here. But even if the 
underreporting is fairly large -- and I don't believe it is -- we're still 
going to have small numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the local rape crisis center (in Austin), they argue that one in three 
women is raped every year. Those people do good work. I respect it. But they 
are not criminologists, and they have a vested interest in inflating the 
numbers to convince people that they provide a necessary service. It's not like 
it's some innocuous academic debate. It's unnecessarily scaring people and 
restricting their freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 His concerns reminded me of another fairly recent crime myth. Last year, a 
national publicity campaign announced that Super Bowl Sunday is the biggest day 
of the year for wife battering in America. The Washington Post investigated the 
claims and found that special-interest groups had misrepresented various 
research. There is no credible evidence of an increase in domestic violence on 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The expose was widely reprinted, but apparently the message didn't get 
through. In my town, and in towns across the country, the news hissed again 
this year about wife abuse triggered by the big football game. This fiction is 
already becoming part of "common knowledge." The only debate permitted is 
whether guys are more likely to batter if their team wins or if it loses. So 
much for the mystic power of truth. 
</P>
<P>
 SERIAL KILLERS FASCINATE ME, and I am not alone in my predilection, if a 
growing body of paperback and television exposes are any indication. Such 
killers are, after all, the ultimate Monstrous Stranger, as close as modern 
"sophisticated" society comes to Satan. Serialists do exist, and their numbers 
may be growing. But the national panic over serialists in the '80s was 
apparently inflamed by a web of misinformation. Its residue persists in popular 
culture and in the law enforcement agencies that benefit from the myths. 
</P>
<P>
 The serialist scare grew with the ghastly revelations of John Wayne Gacy's 
suburban Chicago crawl space in 1978, the 1979 conviction of Ted Bundy and the 
mounting toll of Washington state's Green River murders that started in 1982. 
The final inflammatory straw came in 1983, when a drifter and convicted 
murderer named Henry Lee Lucas confessed to about 300 murders over many states. 
It took more than two years for journalists to puncture the Lucas claims, which 
were eventually reduced to about 10 murders. In his bid for the limelight, 
Lucas guaranteed publicity by (falsely) claiming responsibility for a 
high-profile child abduction case -- the Adam Walsh murder.  
</P>
<P>
 Many news stories of the time depicted serial murder as a sudden epidemic 
claiming 4,000 victims each year. The Justice Department and the FBI were the 
sources of this information, but the numbers were grossly exaggerated, based 
most often on a category called "motiveless murders." In effect, it made every 
unsolved murder the work of a serialist.  
</P>
<P>
 Kappeler, Potter and Blumberg estimate an actual 50 to 60 victims a year 
between 1971 and 1987. They concede an outside possibility that the number is 
between 300 and 400 per year, saying, "This is a terrible figure, but it is far 
short of the much-quoted 4,000." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Supervisory Special Agent Les Davis, a spokesman for the FBI, the 
agency no longer makes public estimates about the number of serialists and 
their victims. "Since (the mid '80s), with the more experience and development 
we have in this area, you start to realize that you really don't know, and you 
can't throw numbers around like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring Jack the Ripper and his English peers, as well as major outbreaks in 
other countries, authorities commonly claim that the serial-killer phenomenon 
is unique to the United States. Based mainly on Lucas and Bundy, serialists are 
described as roaming widely from state to state. Yet the truth is that most 
serialists do all their grisly work in one town or region. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the mistaken information came from the Justice Department, 
Kappeler, Potter and Blumberg are quick to deny any implication of conspiracy. 
They do point out, however, that the inflated epidemic claims and the depiction 
of interstate roaming as a serialist pattern helped justify the founding and 
funding of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime at the FBI 
Academy in Quantico, Va., and the computerized, interstate Violent Criminal 
Apprehension Program. Civil libertarians and local law enforcement agencies had 
successfully resisted this expansion before the serialist panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this new crime-fighting capacity was a result of inadvertent 
misrepresentation, and maybe it has been beneficial (without statistics, 
however, that's impossible to know.) But it seems fair to remember that the 
first beneficiaries of any inflated crime rate are the governmental agencies to 
which we turn for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN SURGEON GENERAL Joycelyn Elders was foolish enough to mention at a press 
conference last December that legalizing drugs might well reduce our crime 
rate, that it was an idea worth studying, the President and the other political 
powers-that-be ducked and denied and distanced themselves from her immediately. 
Her 28-year-old son was arrested within the week for trying to sell cocaine to 
an undercover agent, effectively discrediting Elders' statement and shutting 
her up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elders didn't invent the notion, and it isn't just crackpot tokers who 
support it. The liberal Dr. Benjamin Spock and the conservative William F. 
Buckley agree with former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, economist Milton 
Friedman, legions of criminologists, federal judges, medical professionals and 
other respectable types who have called for serious consideration of legalizing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are clear. The "War on Drugs" has failed. As with Prohibition, 
criminalizing drugs has done nothing but create a tidal wave of crime. The $1.3 
billion spent on efforts to interrupt the flow of drugs into the United States 
from other countries has been wasted. The ban on cheaply produced drugs is an 
excuse to drive the prices up so that users commit more and more crimes to pay 
for them. Illicit profits are so high that traffickers can afford to corrupt 
law enforcement officers into cooperation. With no legitimate way for dealers 
to settle business disputes, bullets act as judge and jury. Drug-dealing gangs 
conduct turf wars in our streets, and the death toll of innocent bystanders 
becomes an excuse for more posturing by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the CIA and the Presidents -- Reagan and Bush -- who launched the 
latest "War on Drugs" have been accused of aiding and abetting the drug lords 
of Asia, Central and South America and the Middle East. Money laundering, 
military assistance, direct cash supports, smuggling and downright trafficking 
have all been laid at the door of various government agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 Illegal drugs have been the pretext for enormous growth in the size and power 
of law enforcement agencies. "The Mythology of Crime" authors state that more 
than 20% of state and local law enforcement budgets is spent on drug 
enforcement. The federal effort alone costs more than $13.2 billion a year. 
More than 58% of federal prison inmates and 21% of all state inmates are 
imprisoned on drug offenses. From 1980 to 1992, the adult prison population of 
the United States rose 166%. Between 1980 and 1990, drug arrests in the United 
States increased 114%. Of the 829,344 felony convictions made in the United 
States, 33% are for individuals arrested on drug charges. Of these, 39% were 
not, according to the authors of "The Mythology of Crime," "for drug 
trafficking, not for selling drugs to innocent schoolchildren, but for 
possession of drugs, most commonly marijuana, the most innocuous of all the 
legal and illegal drugs. Even so, all of these felony convictions account for 
only a little more than 1% of the Americans who use drugs." (The Office of 
National Drug Control Policy says 7%.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Netherlands, where it's legal to possess 30 grams or less of 
marijuana or hashish, has a low drug-usage rate and a low violent-crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Would politicians deliberately create myths about something as serious as 
drugs? In 1989, with public attention wandering away from the "War on Drugs" to 
other social problems, George Bush arranged for the Drug Enforcement 
Administration to make a high-profile bust right in front of the White House. 
The arrest was immediately followed by the President's national TV speech on 
the drug problem. Later, word leaked out that the DEA had gone to considerable 
lengths to persuade the drug dealer to meet the agents in front of the White 
House.  
</P>
<P>
 The war on drugs could escalate to include more substances. With the campaign 
mounting against tobacco, cigarette fiends like me, who comply peacefully with 
restrictions on smoking in public places, smell a full-scale ban in the wind. 
Such a law would, with a stroke of a pen, turn millions of honest citizens into 
criminals. It's no news that nicotine is one of the most addictive substances 
on earth. During the recent unsettling dismemberment of the Soviet Union, the 
vodka shortages produced grumbling, but tobacco shortages triggered riots. I 
have nightmares of tending tobacco plants under grow-lights in my attic and 
dying in a hail of bullets as the drug squad storms the stairs. Imagine whole 
new tribes of smugglers building fortunes on bootleg tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 THESE EXAMPLES ARE A small fraction of the mountain of crime mythology most of 
us have been fed. All of this information is available in the drab professional 
journals, but the mainstream media, from the news to sitcoms, from the front 
page to the comics, often delivers exactly the opposite message. I, and 
millions like me, want to believe the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 90 million Americans sit down to watch TV every night, and one in 10,000 
of us goes out to imitate the violence, according to a TV social-impact 
researcher. But the rest of us are affected, too. We buy the intensely 
dangerous cathode world as more real than our own humdrum experience. We become 
suspicious. Distrustful. Afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 Scary tales are ancient and reliable tools. You rally support for war by 
drawing the enemy in classic monster terms -- ruthless destroyers of the social 
order, laughing as they bayonet babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanism is simple. Like all animals, we humans respond to information, 
even secondhand information. The watch crow calls from the treetop, and the 
whole flock rises, fleeing danger. In simpler days, anything we heard about was 
important to us. If somebody staggered into camp hollering "saber-tooth!" we 
didn't ask for proof before we grabbed our spears. Small-town citizens of the 
buckboard era didn't wait for a government report when the fire alarms sounded, 
they grabbed their buckets and ran to help. Those reflexes serve us well in 
most catastrophes. But in a modern technological world, we see children 
starving 12,000 miles away, the murder victim's mother screaming across the 
continent. A huge nation of crime is deposited in our living rooms nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 There is rarely anything we can do about it, but we respond. We think that if 
horror can strike that guy over there, it threatens us, too. Call it sympathy 
or empathy or stupidity, it's one of the best things about us. It's what makes 
rescuers risk their lives in earthquakes and blazing buildings for people they 
don't even know. And it makes us vulnerable. We try to protect ourselves with 
taboos against yelling fire in a crowded hall or crying wolf when it's just a 
mean dog with a gimpy leg. But we can be lied to. 
</P>
<P>
 And we let it happen again and again, precisely because most of the news 
doesn't actually touch us directly. After all, we believe a lot of mistaken, 
goofy things. Many of us believe we'll suffocate if we cover our entire bodies 
with gold paint, that hair and fingernails go on growing after you die, or that 
saltpeter depletes the sex drive. A lot of us believe in professional 
wrestling, the second coming of Elvis, or that the Mother Ship will beam us up 
to a peaceful cloudland. It doesn't necessarily affect our day-to-day 
functioning. Most of us get to work every morning and put food on the table and 
make it to Little League games on time. We can afford to swallow every crime 
myth that comes along because they're entertaining, but they don't intrude 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to see the long-term, big-picture price we pay for that 
delicious roil of fear -- the loss of sleep, the loss of trust, the erosion of 
civil rights. Real, deadly, destructive crime -- fueled by the ready 
availability of guns -- does exist, and the hysteria doesn't help the people 
who are faced with it every day.  
</P>
<P>
 We need to cut through the vapor to see the real problem. Legalizing drugs 
would eliminate much of the violence that surrounds banned substances. If we 
are serious about protecting our children from the things that endanger them 
most, we must examine the family itself. But the myths surrounding these topics 
are so emotional and pervasive that it seems politically impossible to push 
past them. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to keep in mind that we aren't doing so badly, given our natures. The 
number of murder victims, for example, is a very tiny percentage of our huge 
population, less than .001% of the total population per year. Fewer than 
suicides. Far fewer than those killed in motor vehicle accidents. Consider that 
humans are the most aggressive and dangerous predator on the planet. Smart 
tigers turn tail at our scent. And yet we are astoundingly well socialized. We 
live piled up in cities, claw to jaw, by the millions and we do not have bloody 
mayhem on every street corner every minute of every day. That happens in my 
adored television world, but there is, after all, a difference between 
realistic and real. The majority of us will never yield to our natural impulse 
to brain the lady who shoves in front of us in the supermarket line or to pitch 
our boss through the office window. If any system, agency, or chunk of 
machinery ran with 99.999% efficiency, we'd consider it an incredible success.  
</P>
<P>
 Do we get credit for it? Rarely. We focus on the failures. We seldom hear 
about things like the growing, prospering black middle class, the strides 
toward equality for women, the dropping infant mortality rate, or the fact that 
we are generally living longer and healthier than ever before in human history. 
Government agencies rarely announce their mission completed so they can 
disband. No activist group ever seems to stand up and holler, "We did it! We 
defeated the monster! We won!" That would put them out of business. Problems 
are always worse now than ever before. Failure breeds scary stories that 
produce fear, which leads to acquiescence. Failure buys tax dollars, feeds 
political campaigns and spawns social-work programs. Failure is where the money 
is.

 With the April 22 observance of Earth Day just around the corner, thoughts 
turn to the state of the planet -- and how we can keep it from spinning out of 
control. Recycling is perhaps the easiest, most popular way to help, but 
nowadays, sorting newsprint, cans and bottles is no longer enough.For recycling 
to be more than the pointless collection of tons of paper, aluminum, plastic 
and glass, we must also open our pocketbooks and buy goods that are made from 
these and other reusable resources. Fortunately, numerous designers and 
craftspeople offer a growing selection of "green" clothes, jewelry, toys and 
housewares. (For more information, send $2 for the booklet "Shopper's Guide to 
Recycled Products" to Californians Against Waste Foundation, 926 J St., Suite 
606, Sacramento, CA 95814, (916) 443-5422.) Some of the items shown here are 
created nearby; others, halfway 'round the world. All are part of the 
if-in-doubt-don't-toss-it-out movement, in which materials formerly used only 
once turn up in second-generation products. Metal license plates are reborn as 
hibachis, and scraps of movie celluloid are strung together as dangly earrings. 
Even compostable organic materials take on new shape, with deciduous leaves 
getting pressed into picnic dishes and cow manure being molded into lawn 
ornaments. In other words, to sort and buy is to recycle with a cause. SUSAN

MAIN STAY; CHINOIS CLASSICS, CHEF TANAKA'S LATEST CREATIONS AND COOKIES OF GOOD 
FORTUNE. THIS IS LIVING.

 When Wolfgang Puck opened Chinois on Main, the only reservation you had a 
chance of getting was either very early or very late. More than 10 years later, 
that's still the case, unless you plan ahead. The groundbreaking restaurant 
with its quirky melange of East and West is still sizzling hot because the food 
is still seriously good. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Makoto Tanaka and his skilled kitchen staff produce dishes with such 
intensity and focus that it is impossible not to be impressed. One bite of the 
barbecued baby pork ribs with their honey-chile sauce or the first taste of the 
extraordinary tempura ahi tuna sashimi in a masterful, mysterious uni (sea 
urchin) sauce, and I know I want to eat these dishes again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 If (that is, when ) you have to wait for your table, it's nice to linger 
outside in the balmy night. Despite the crowd at the door, the hostess won't 
abandon you there. Once you're seated, a complimentary dish arrives swiftly to 
acknowledge the delay, the Chinois Chinese chicken salad in our case: shredded 
cabbage, chicken and bits of crunchy, deep-fried wonton skins tossed in 
chile-spiked dressing. Nobody makes this popular salad better. 
</P>
<P>
 The dizzyingly eccentric decor by Puck's wife and partner Barbara Lazaroff 
isn't as shocking as it once was; it actually looks a bit dated. But I still 
love the splayed metal table bases with their turquoise lacquered tables set 
with black bamboo place mats. The orchid blossoms, kept fresh in tiny glass 
tubes behind a picture window, still induce a peculiar claustrophobia. The 
noise level, clamorous at best, is intolerable if a large table or two is 
making merry. Once you put something in your mouth, though, none of these 
annoyances seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is evenly divided between Chinois classics and the latest creations, 
about a dozen of each. Those marvelous baby pork ribs and the tempura ahi tuna 
sashimi belong to the former category, as do the astonishingly good curried 
oysters. They're rolled in curry powder, cooked just enough to bring out the 
spice's flavor and presented in the shell in a puddle of cool cucumber sauce. 
Although I've never had foie gras cooked better in this country than it is 
here, the marinated grilled fresh pineapple is too sweet to be a great foil. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the classic entrees seem out of touch with the times, like the 
beautiful Cantonese duck in a cloyingly sweet crimson plum sauce. The 
dramatically presented catfish is not something I crave time after time. 
However perfectly cooked, these farm-raised catfish just don't have much 
flavor. Our waiter one night described the Mongolian lamb chops as awesome -- 
and that they were, with a deep lamb flavor, tender texture and a bracing green 
cilantro sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the newest dishes are where Tanaka's cooking comes to the foreground. To 
my mind, these are the most interesting -- no mean feat considering the quality 
of the Chinois classics, perfected by former chef Kazuto Matsusaka, who left 
two years ago to open Zenzero. This winter, Tanaka served gamy, rare roasted 
loin of venison in a lake of blood-colored sauce made with Port and sun-dried 
cherries spiced with ginger. A fetching duck-and-shredded-vegetable salad in a 
refreshingly bitter citrus dressing was recently replaced with a remarkable 
grilled squab and wild mushroom salad spiked with bits of pancetta. The new 
lobster spring rolls are not that exciting, but Tanaka turns out spectacular 
Louisiana shrimp in a pretty plum-shiso sauce fired with Chinese mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to know why this restaurant works so well, spend an evening seated 
at the counter overlooking the kitchen. The woks are immense, the heat intense. 
One cook throws live lobsters into a pan; another pulls catfish after catfish 
from the boiling oil. Hand-pleated ravioli with a tender, moist stuffing of 
chicken and vegetables brown in a skillet while the cook untangles black and 
gold noodles for a grilled salmon dish. All the while, Tanaka stands at the 
center, firing orders. Every dish has to pass by him before it goes out to a 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the meal, it's often hard to muster an appetite for the bevy of 
desserts. Fortunately, they're not all as rich as the warm chocolate truffle 
cake topped off with chocolate sauce or the mandarin orange cheesecake paired 
with raspberry coulis. The three tiny crocks of creme brulee , flavored with 
ginger, hazelnut and chocolate, are a lovely diversion. The shimmery coconut 
flan could use more coconut, however. The individual layered hazelnut-chocolate 
torte garnished with gold leaf is elegant and delicious. You can order a 
pinwheel of orange slices with a fine grenadine caramel or simply -- and this 
may be the best idea -- a plate of homemade ice creams and "cookies of good 
fortune." I always hope they will slip in a fortune that reads, "You will 
return soon to Chinois."

THE WINE LIST 
</P>

<P>
 Restaurants must sell more Chardonnay than all other wines combined. The other 
night at Chinois on Main, Chardonnay was on nine of the 12 tables that had 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chardonnay doesn't really enhance many foods, particularly at Chinois, 
where the flavors are anything but bland. This sort of Asian-influenced cooking 
demands a wine as spicy as 1991 Navarro Gewurztraminer. At $21, it's cheaper 
than any of the Chardonnays. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, only a few wines on this list would work with the variety of foods 
usually served at a Chinois dinner. Others are 1992 Ferrari-Carano Fume Blanc, 
$24; 1991 Stag's Leap Sauvignon Blanc, $18, and 1990 Trimbach Gewurztraminer 
from the Alsace, $26, a marvelous ginger-friendly wine. Red wines are a hard 
match because of the various sweet, sour, hot and salty sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason to drink a well-flavored wine is the smoking policy. Wine 
lovers will be irritated that Chinois permits smoking at the bar, which happens 
to be smack in the middle of the restaurant. Only a full-aroma wine such as 
Gewurztraminer can hope to compete with the smoke. Dan Berger

STAGE WATCH: PADUA HILLS FINDS A HOME AT WOODBURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Padua Hills, L.A.'s most famous new-play festival, is back in action. After an 
absence of two years because of money woes, the festival will resume July 
21-Aug. 14 at a new location, Woodbury University, on the border between 
northern Burbank and Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre jump-started the moribund festival 
with a $25,000 challenge grant last summer, plans were underway to return Padua 
Hills to its most recent home on the campus of Cal State Northridge. Those 
plans were changed by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the previous Padua Hills facilities were not badly damaged, extensive 
damage elsewhere on the campus made the prospect of hosting Padua "daunting" to 
university officials, said Padua artistic director Murray Mednick. So a search 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most distinctive features of Padua Hills is that its productions 
are heavily site-specific, designed for outdoor environments rather than 
conventional theaters. The Woodbury campus, a former convent, has no 
conventional theater; it's a business and design school. But it does offer a 
variety of interesting alfresco sites, Mednick said. He hopes to use a 
switchbacked walkway down the side of a hill for his own play. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is near the Burbank airport, but Mednick said airplane noise didn't 
bother him on his visits to the campus -- and he added that he's "very 
sensitive" to such noise. Noise from the nearby Golden State Freeway was more 
of a problem, but Padua playwrights will just have to incorporate any such 
noises into the ambience of the plays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Mednick, playwrights whose works will be presented this summer are 
John Steppling, Maria Irene Fornes, John O'Keefe, Shem Bitterman, Neena Beber 
and Susan Mosakowski, all familiar Padua names from previous years. These and 
other writers also will teach daytime classes and workshops. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 WEEKLY WATCH: "Distant Fires" won three awards -- more than any other show -- 
at the L.A. Weekly's annual awards ceremony for sub-100-seat theater, held at 
Los Angeles Theatre Center last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual at the Weekly ceremony, the honors for outstanding productions went 
to shows that won no other awards. "Washington Square Moves" was named 
production of the year, "The Boys in the Band" revival of the year, and "Patty! 
Patty! Bang! Bang!" musical of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "Distant Fires," the only other shows to win more than one award were 
"Psycho Beach Party" and "Neva's Tale," with two each. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for the first time, one of the Weekly awards brought cash as well 
as glory. Anthony Embeck won $3,000 for writing "Ray-Ka-Pay." The money was 
courtesy of the Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre (see the above item for another 
example of Skirball-Kenis beneficence). The sum is equal to the amount that 
Skirball-Kenis gives the annual winner of the city's other major playwriting 
award, the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle's Ted Schmitt Award, which will be 
presented today to Roger Rueff at the LADCC ceremony in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 The thank-yous and other commentaries weren't as provocative as they have been 
at some previous Weekly ceremonies, despite able emceeing by the "Ruthless!" 
cast and a succession of cross-dressed awards bearers. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't blame Corey Beth Madden, associate producing director of the Mark 
Taper Forum. She presented the revival award dressed as her boss, Taper 
artistic director Gordon Davidson, complete with gray hair and bushy eyebrows. 
"Has anyone noticed how hard it is for a woman to make it as an artistic 
director in this town?," Madden asked. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 LERNER TRIBUTE: "Salon at the Taper," an annual fund-raiser for Center Theatre 
Group, will salute the songs of Alan Jay Lerner on April 25. Michael Feinstein 
will host Tim Curry, Joanna Gleason, James Earl Jones and others. Information:

 THOMAS: "Hamlet." Thomas Hampson, June Anderson, Samuel Ramey, Denyce Graves, 
Gregory Kunde, others; London Philharmonic, Antonio de Almeida, conductor. EMI 
DCDD 7 54820 2.This generally well-sung performance of Thomas' rarity offers 
proof that there are often good reasons why some operas have disappeared from 
sight. At three hours plus, the score's longueurs can be a trial. Nevertheless 
the cast is game, especially Hampson's aristocratic, gorgeously varied, vocally 
colored prince; his French is elegantly idiomatic. Ophelia is one of Anderson's 
finest recorded achievements, her Mad Scene sung with dazzling technique and 
bravura style. Kunde as Laertes continues to add favorably to his growing 
reputation, while Graves is almost too beautifully youthful a Gertrude. Ramey, 
who apparently wants to record everything written for bass, is his usual 
sonorous self, but not much more. Almeida holds things together reasonably 
well, but does little in the way of subtlety, finesse or a sense of drama. A 
"tragic" ending more in line with Shakespeare and written for Covent Garden 
(the original has Hamlet alive and crowned king) is appended, as well as a duet 
for Claudius and Gertrude and the excruciatingly dull ballet music.WALTER PRICE

 OPERA DUETS BY MASSENET, MASCAGNI, VERDI, BELLINI, BIZET. Agnes Baltsa, 
mezzo-soprano; Jose Carreras, tenor; London Symphony, Placido Domingo, 
conductor. Sony 53968.There have been some strange releases over the years, but 
this disc, recorded in London in 1990 and 1991, is one of the oddest. It sounds 
as if Baltsa and Carreras were in separate studios, with the tenor practically 
sitting on the mikes, while the mezzo's voice seems to be piped in from the 
Scottish border. In most unison singing she is all but drowned out. His voice 
is distressingly threadbare, with little suggestion of the gorgeous lyric shine 
it had early on. The tone appears produced by main force. Hers shows such 
shifting of gears from one register to the next that it's anybody's guess what 
sound is going to emerge. Domingo demonstrates no special insight in his 
conducting chores. The "Werther" is best, because the music is droopy, anyway. 
The "Trovatore" scene emerges limp and plodding, with no tension, no line and 
both singers sadly overparted. The "Traviata" duet is gimmicky; Verdi certainly 
could not have intended his Violetta to have a mezzo's coloration. There may 
well have been some soul searching for three years before releasing the record. 
Unfortunately, here it is. WALTER PRICE

 CHARLIE HADEN QUARTET WEST

 "Always Say Goodbye" 
</P>

</P>

 * * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Haden's unique approach to sampling earns an impressive workout here. 
Though the basic group comprises Haden, Alan Broadbent (piano), Ernie Watts 
(saxes) and Larance Marable (drums), there are guest appearances by a wild 
assortment of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening quote borrows a sample of Max Steiner's music from "The Big 
Sleep," the 1946 movie. Other visitors are Coleman Hawkins, whose quartet plays 
"My Love and I" from a 1962 album; Jo Stafford, the Ella Fitzgerald of pop, in 
a creamy 1944 reading of "Alone Together," and Django Reinhardt with Stephane 
Grappelli in a 1949 taping of "Ou Es Tu, Mon Amour?" for which Grappelli adds 
to the confusion by also appearing live with Haden. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Duke Ellington Orchestra is sampled for a cut from his 1959 
"Anatomy of a Murder" movie score, with an admirable violin solo by Ray Nance. 
Chet Baker sings "Everything Happens to Me" with a 1955 French rhythm section. 
Finally we return to the "Big Sleep" track, with the last words spoken by 
Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. 
</P>
<P>
 All these miscellanea are bonuses; the main course is the quartet itself, 
playing chiefly attractive originals by Haden or Broadbent. Among them: 
Broadbent's stately "Avenue of the Stars" and "Sunset Afternoon," Haden's title 
tune and "Nice Eyes." There are even bows to early be-bop with Bird's "Relaxin' 
at Camarillo" and Bud Powell's "Celia." All in all, an ingenious, surprise-rich 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent). LEONARD FEATHER

POP EYE: WHADDYA WANT FOR $20? A TICKET TO PEARL JAM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chuck Philips 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rock fans aren't the only ones concerned over the escalating price of concert 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam, arguably the hottest U.S. rock act these days, has put promoters 
around the country on notice that no ticket at any of its summer shows can be 
sold for more than $19.80 -- service fee included. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for most rock concerts range from around $22 to $55, plus phone 
service charges that often add about $6 to $8. Promoters sold seats to upcoming 
Barbra Streisand and Eagles concerts for as much as $350 and $115 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the music industry is not only out of touch, they're getting 
just plain greedy," Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis says. "Pearl Jam doesn't 
want to be a part of the way it works now. We're not trying to go to battle 
with anybody, but we believe the prices these middlemen charge are simply not 
worth the service they provide." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle quintet issued letters last week to promoters vowing to perform 
only at venues that charge no more than $1.80 for service or handling charges 
-- a fee that must be clearly printed in concert advertisements and on the face 
of each $18 ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam's action flies in the face of industry standards instituted for the 
most part by Ticketmaster, a Los Angeles-based firm that has dominated the 
service fee market since 1991 when it bought certain assets from Ticketron, 
thus putting its primary competitor out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster -- which processes more than $1 billion worth of tickets each 
year to concert and sporting events in 42 states -- pays venue owners a portion 
of each convenience fee it collects to subsidize exclusive long-term contracts. 
Some promoters and artists also retain a portion of service fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Rosen, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Ticketmaster, 
declined comment on Pearl Jam's move. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over ticket prices and service fees has been intense for years as 
fans continue to be charged higher prices by artist managers, promoters and 
service companies as well as by private brokers and scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam has tried to save fans money by selling as many tickets as possible 
directly through its fan club, following in the footsteps, Kelly says, of the 
Grateful Dead. The club's address: Ten Club, PO Box 4570, Seattle, Wa. 98104. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has found it difficult in the past to lower service fee rates 
because promoters affiliated with venues under contract to Ticketmaster could 
not charge such low fees. Two promoters contacted by Pop Eye expressed 
reservations about Pearl Jam's new policy, saying it could preclude them from 
putting on shows this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelly says the band is prepared to book shows in large fields or other 
outdoor venues not traditionally associated with the national concert circuit. 
The tour -- set to kick off in Montana in June -- does not include a Los 
Angeles area date. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not many bands who are in the position where they can try to do 
something that really makes a difference for young fans who don't have much 
money," Curtis says. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Lead singer) Eddie Vedder knows what it feels like not to have enough money 
to be able to buy a ticket or a T-shirt at his favorite band's show and he 
wants to turn this thing around. We think this new policy is going to put a 
crack in the dam and that other bands with good intentions will soon follow our 
lead." Chuck Philips

 The new House of Blues club on the Sunset Strip, originally scheduled to open 
in March, is now set to have its official inauguration with two invitation-only 
events: a show by club investor Aerosmith on April 22, followed by an April 30 
benefit for the Magic Johnson Foundation featuring the Blues Brothers (Dan 
Aykroyd co-owns the club chain), the Black Crowes, James Brown and John Lee 
Hooker. A full schedule of concerts starts in May. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two of rap's leading acts have new albums due in July: Chuck D., Flavor Flav 
and crew are working on a new Public Enemy album, while LL Cool J, who 
continues to be one of rap's top-selling artists, is finishing up his latest. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Harry Connick Jr. is said to be returning to his old New Orleans roots for his 
next album, a change from the lighter, jazz-pop flavor of most of his recent 
work. The album is expected in June. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John Lydon will make an eight-city U.S. book-signing tour for his new 
autobiography, "Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs," including a planned stop 
at West Hollywood's Book Soup on April 21. Lydon, having disbanded Public Image 
Ltd., is also working on his first solo album for Atlantic Records. . . . While 
in town, maybe Lydon can check out the new high-concept L.A. band the Spock 
Pistols -- four guys who dress like "Star Trek's" Mr. Spock and perform only 
Sex Pistols songs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Booker T. & the MG's' first album in 17 years will be released by Columbia 
Records on May 24. "That's the Way It Should Be" includes instrumental versions 
of U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For," Janet Jackson's "Let's 
Wait a While" and Bob Dylan's "Gotta Serve Somebody," as well as original 
tracks, including the first single, "Cruisin'." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ice Cube is setting up a summer concert tour following two spring acting 
stints -- he's starring in John Singleton's "Higher Learning" and an indie film 
titled "Friday." . . . English industrial duo Nitzer Ebb is putting the 
finishing touches on an album now due in September.

 HEY MR. DEEJAY: One of the last bastions of vinyl records may be about to 
fall. Though CDs and cassettes have made the old black discs virtually 
obsolete, they've remained the life-blood of nightclub deejays, who like to 
"scratch," mix and otherwise manipulate music in ways that just can't be done 
with CDs and cassettes . . . until now, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Pioneer Electronics will release a system allowing "hands on" CD 
spinning. This mixer comes with a joystick-type device that manipulates the CDs 
back and forth and also allows deejays to change the beat speed without 
affecting the vocals.  
</P>
<P>
 "We showed deejays an early prototype and their jaws dropped," says Scott 
Fisher, the marketing manager for Pioneer's new media technologies division. 
"We also took in their feedback and enlarged the buttons and simplified the 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it vinyl's last stand? At least one national deejay isn't running out to 
replace his record collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plenty of companies have attempted this . . . and they're nothing I've been 
stoked about," says Baby G, deejay for the rap group Mad Flava and the winner 
of 1990's Disco Mix Club championship -- the biggest international deejay 
competition. "They're easy to use, but with vinyl, I get to feel it, and I can 
manipulate it more." 
</P>
<P>
 He fears, though, that the new technology could make vinyl records even 
scarcer. "Maybe we need to get a pro-vinyl coalition thing happening," he says. 
"After all, the music that gets sold is (introduced) on the streets. If the 5% 
of us weren't spinning it, 95% of the people wouldn't be buying it. And we're 
not spinning CDs." Heidi Siegmund

 ANOTHER TRIBUTE?: The latest tribute album in the works actually has a few 
surprises to offer. It's a collection of artists honoring the Carpenters, and 
the roster of acts signed up might not be what you'd expected.Committed to the 
project already are Sonic Youth, Redd Kross, American Music Club, the 
Cranberries, Bettie Serveert and Shonen Knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, the brainchild of rock journalist David Kojoyan and producer Matt 
Wallace, will be released later this year by A&M to mark the 25th anniversary 
of the Carpenters' signing with the company. An A&M spokeswoman insists that it 
is a loving tribute by rockers who truly like the brother-and-sister duo's 
music. Sonic Youth fans will recall the song "Tunic (Song for Karen)" from the 
band's album "Goo," in which Kim Gordon portrays the late Karen Carpenter, who 
died in 1983 after bouts with anorexia nervosa, reassuring her family that 
she's doing fine in the afterlife.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing remains to be decided: Which groups will get to sing the Carpenters' 
most-loved hits, "Close to You" and "Superstar"? Steve Hochman

2Pac's intense, touching "Pain" is one of the year's best rap songs, and his

behind.Also exceptional: B Rezell's breezy commentary on pot-smoking, "Blowed 
Away." The only wretched track: Al B. Sure!'s "I'm Still in Love With You." 
Most of the 21 gangsta rap and racy, mid-tempo R&B tracks are above average.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three

POP MUSIC CHARTS: THE AGE OF ACROPOLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 What's happening to The Times' Southern California pop album Top 10? There are 
all sorts of strange intruders, such as the Benedictine Monks of Santa Domingo 
de Silos doing "Chant" (No. 6) and Enigma's "The Cross of Changes" (No. 7) -- 
not to mention Yanni's "Live at the Acropolis." All have a New Age slant and, 
compared to the usual Top 10 entries, are sort of oddball. Normally an album 
like one of these might creep into the elite circle a few times a year -- but 
never three at the same time. Could this be the start of a trend, with a New 
Age wave engulfing the Top 10? TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,43,11 Title, Artist

RECORD RACK: ROLLINS FINDS A NEW VOICE IN 'WEIGHT' 
</P>

 ROLLINS BAND

<P>
 "Weight"

<P>
 Imago  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Dazed by incessant violence, fried from information overload, worn down by the 
task of living, the characters stumbling through Henry Rollins' songs are easy 
marks for slick messiahs, false-front entertainers and poets peddling gangster 
fantasies to fools who end up paying the heavy price. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins' compelling need to assert his individuality amid these forces is the 
defining dynamic of his art, and it's made him a hero to an audience that draws 
energy from his resolve.He's like a martial-arts hero of the psychic terrain, 
and his war with hypocrisy and repression is played out on a scale that's both 
intimate and larger than life -- his feelings are too intense and colossal to 
be conveyed in conventional terms, so his bellow is super human, and his band 
plays its deliberate sludge-metal riffs with crushing power. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins, also a writer and reader of prose and poetry, tries this time to vary 
his voice a bit, assuming character identities that require him to speak and 
rap in an actorish way that dilutes his power. And the album's production (by 
Theo Van Rock) separates his singing from the instruments, so his voice seems 
superimposed on the music. 
</P>
<P>
 On his last album, "The End of Silence," he was down there in the crucible and 
he came off as a relentless, primordial force of nature. The slightly synthetic 
feel here makes Rollins a little easier to identify, file and forget. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 GANG STARR 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard to Earn" 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysalis  
</P>
<P>
 * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the accolades showered on Gang Starr's rapper Guru for last year's 
inventive side project -- the jazz/hip-hop hybrid "Jazzmatazz" -- were a bit 
much for the Brooklyn-based performer. "Hard to Earn," Gang Starr's fourth 
album, seems a conscious effort to undo the "Jazzmatazz" progress and go back 
to hip-hop's comfortable old school, with DJ Premier relying more on his 
scratching skills and a beat box than jazz breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Songs such as "Code of the Streets" and the ominous, anti-gun "Tonz 'O' Gunz" 
remind you that Guru's intelligent, laconic delivery is one of hip-hop's most 
distinctive. At his best, he seems to be strolling down the street with you, 
putting a comforting arm around your shoulder while offering a detailed guide 
to urban survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he spends the second half of the 17-track album locked into one 
aspect of old school that's getting pretty tired -- bragging. Even though 
boasting one's skills and slamming "sucka MCs" is as inherent an element of 
hip-hop as crusty old twice-recorded cassette tapes, Guru is simply wasting our 
time. With a mind and tongue as nimble as his, you wish he'd spend more time 
dropping knowledge and less time trumpeting talent we already know he's got. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 IRIS DeMENT 
</P>
<P>
 "My Life" 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Good news: The disarming sincerity that made DeMent's 1992 debut, "Infamous 
Angel," so enchanting is equally abundant on its successor.Proof that the sweet 
country girl isn't always seduced by fame and fortune along the road from the 
farm (in DeMent's case, the tiny Philo folk label) to the big city (media giant 
Warner Bros.). 
</P>
<P>
 The songs may be more consistently somber here, but they're no less keenly 
observed. The Arkansas-born, Southern California-reared singer-songwriter 
sketches lives as vividly as Randy Newman and John Prine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easy's Gettin' Harder Every Day" is such an exquisite eulogy to love that's 
passed away that you want to nominate it for a literary Pulitzer and a Grammy. 
Only fleetingly -- as in the chorus of "No Time to Cry" -- does she cross the 
line separating honest self-revelation from self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
 Her old-timey sound, blending traditional country, bluegrass and gospel, is 
intact as well -- no surprise, since virtually all the "Infamous Angel" 
musicians and technicians are back. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it really surprising that when it came time for Iris DeMent to move 
uptown, she wouldn't leave her values behind. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

ROSEANNE AND TOM LATHER IT UP

 Prime time's most controversial couple, Tom and Roseanne Arnold, took a trip 
to daytime last month. 
</P>
<P>
 After several postponements, "General Hospital" viewers got to see the Arnolds 
March 22-24 in a story line that took Luke and Laura to an Atlantic City 
casino, where the Arnolds' characters, natch, could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne, who is a fan of "General Hospital," played Jennifer Smith, the 
daughter of crime figure Frank Smith (played by Susan Haskell). Tom played 
Jennifer's husband, Billy "Baggs" Boggs. Luke and Laura (Tony Geary and Genie 
Francis) went to the Jersey shore looking for Jennifer and Baggs, who own a 
casino. "Roseanne" fans will remember that Geary and Francis made guest 
appearances on the nighttime series earlier this year.

 James E. Reilly recently signed a new contract with "Days of Our Lives" and 
will continue as the show's head writer. Several of Reilly's story lines that 
were extremely popular with the soap's viewers included the "Carly Buried 
Alive" story and the "Who Fathered Marlena's Baby?" story. 
</P>
<P>
 While we are on the subject of writers, the writing team over at "Loving" 
(including Millee Taggart, Robert Guza Jr., Laurie McCarthy, Addie Walsh, Craig 
Carlson, John Kuntz, Eugenie Hunt, Dana Herko, Lew Arlt, Tony Lang, Lynda 
Miles, Juliette Mann, Andrew Gottlieb and Nancy Maxwell) received the Writers 
Guild of America award for best writing in a daytime serial. Competition for 
the award, which was presented March 13 at the 46th Annual Writers Guild of 
America Awards, included "General Hospital," "All My Children," "Another World" 
and "Days of Our Lives." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "One Life to Live" also brought home an award recently. On March 5, at its 
46th Annual Awards ceremony, the Directors Guild of America presented director 
Jill Mitwell with an award for best director of a daytime serial. 
</P>

 Krista Bonura has joined the cast of "Loving" in the recurring role of Alexis, 
the 4-year-old daughter of Alex and Egypt Masters (played by Randolph Mantooth 
and Linda Cook). When Egypt left town a couple of weeks ago, she left little 
Alexis with her daddy. Egypt's exit also marked the exit of actress Linda Cook.

 This 1993 Disney release is a fine family film, a vast improvement over the 
1963 version.This time, the tale of three pets who make their way through a 
forest wilderness provides voices for a wise and mature golden retriever, a 
frisky bulldog puppy and a fastidious Himalayan cat. And it involves the 
family, who left them behind temporarily with a friend. A skillful job all 
around, especially by director Duwayne Dunham and writers Caroline Thompson and 
Linda Woolverton. Robert Hays and Kim Greist star (Disney Channel Monday at 
1:05 a.m.). Kevin Thomas

 AND ONE MORE THING: "Rock Talk," a new book collecting amusing quotes by and 
about rockers, includes, among other things, a whole short chapter on "Guitar 
Smashing 101." Quoted, naturally, on the subject of instrument destroying are 
the likes of Pete Townshend and Kurt Cobain. But also represented is Les Paul, 
the inventor of the electric guitar, who says of the smashing: "I encourage 
them because they have to go out and buy more guitars."

 This 1992 release proves one more time that when it comes to modern screen 
comedy, writer-director Andrew Bergman is nothing less than the emperor of the 
absurd. Nicolas Cage (right) stars as a private eye who elopes to Las Vegas 
with second-grade teacher Sarah Jessica Parker, who unfortunately is the very 
image of the beloved dead wife of James Caan, a big-time gambler who will do 
anything to get her to marry him. What's more, Vegas seems to be hosting the 
largest gathering ever of Elvis impersonators (Showtime Wednesday at 1:15 and 
9:45 p.m.; Saturday at 8:45 a.m. and next Sunday at 1:55 a.m.). Kenneth Turan

 With Hole's second album and major-label debut, the quartet proves itself 
powerful enough to break away from the infamy of its leader Courtney Love, and 
emerge as a separate but equally charismatic entity. The band's more accessible 
follow-up to its acidic 1992 debut "Pretty on the Inside" packs intellect, 
humor, volatile emotion and recklessness inside churning and contagious 
melodies -- a combination that makes it the year's most complete album yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Love sings in deep, raspy, bittersweet tones, then unleashes full-throttled 
screams full of intense anger and defiance. The vocal shifts are both caressing 
and abrasive, with incredibly sad lyrics that reflect the turmoil in Love's 
life ("Every time I sell myself to you, I feel a little cheaper than I have 
to"). The music goes from contemplative to manic, but always keeps its 
composure inside a slightly gruff but perfect pop structure. "Live Through 
This" is an album aimed at all levels of the human psyche, and rarely if ever 
misses its target. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 Two psycho lovers, Dylan McDermott and Jennifer Rubin, terrorize a woman, 
Christine Lahti (left, with Rubin) who suffers from agoraphobia in this 1992 
cable production.A cut or two above most suspense stories because of the 
gripping performances under Leon Ichaso's direction and a script (by David 
Birke) that puts a twist on the old premise of a victim trapped in her house. 
Posing as brother and sister, McDermott and Rubin ingratiate themselves into 
Lahti's life and her spacious, isolated home. Recently separated, she is 
seeking companionship to alleviate her irrational fear of the outdoors (USA 
Thursday at 9 p.m.). Ray Loynd

 In adapting the late Robin Harris' sketch about taking some obstreperous 
youngsters to an amusement park, director Bruce Smith and writer Reginald 
Hudlin & Co. have made the first animated theatrical feature with African 
American characters as principals. The result is an imaginative delight, yet 
it's also blunt about what it's like to be black in America. Amid the the 
amusement park fun, this 1992 film makes it quite clear how African Americans 
are too often viewed with suspicion and mistrust (Cinemax Saturday at 8:45 
a.m.). Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; CAN LESLIE JORDAN'S SOUTHERN COMFORTS SET 'HEARTS AFIRE' 
ABLAZE?

 It could be a lucky sign for "Hearts Afire" star Leslie Jordan that his show 
follows "Murphy Brown" this week. His 1988 turn as Murphy's 11th secretary -- 
the lovable klutzy ex-con Kyle -- was his big break. After a string of flops, 
Jordan hopes the "Murphy" lead-in will serve as a charm, and draw an audience 
to his ninth sitcom in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan got the role of endearing, bumbling printer Lonnie Garr after telling 
stories to the producers. It's easy to see why. The Tennessee native is as 
funny, if not funnier, without a script. His high-pitched Southern accent, 
combined with an energetic comedic delivery, makes him irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to add a recurring character, but didn't know what they wanted, 
so they got together a weirdo assortment of comedians," he recalls of his 
meeting with "Hearts" writers. "They told us to tell stories. So I just 
launched into this story about a woman I knew in church whose baby looked just 
like a pig. My mother used to say it was pitiful how she would dress up the pig 
baby in frills." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, he was asked to tell the same story to producer Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason. He was told to report to the set next morning. He'd gotten 
the job. "And there was the pig story in the script, using the woman's real 
name!" he says. Embarrassed, he persuaded them to change it -- which they did . 
Slightly . They changed a letter from both her first and last names. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan says it has become a running joke about which of his hometown 
characters will appear in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Tennessee theater degree in hand, Jordan "hopped a Greyhound bus 
on Valentine's Day 1982, dumber than dirt and greener than grass. Makes me 
tired to think about it," he says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't decide where I wanted to go, New York or Los Angeles. But I 
decided that if I was going to starve, it would be with a tan." 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-foot-11 actor immediately found work in commercials: "I hit town when 
that retarded white-trash-from-the-hills look was in and, boy, did I have 
that!" 
</P>
<P>
 Within nine months, he was in eight national commercials. "I did Aunt Jemima 
Lite Syrup, I was the Pip boy for years, I started the Del Taco 'Same time, 
same place' bit . . . I was always the bellhop, the busboy, the window washer." 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked left and right until the beautiful people came back," Jordan says. 
Eventually, he got television roles. Then came Kyle the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after that "Murphy" episode aired, his agent told him, "Everyone 
wants to meet with you." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the auditions led to nine sitcoms -- all flops. He was offered a role 
on "Alf." "But then," Jordan says, "everyone told me, 'Honey, you look like 
that puppet.' " Instead, he took "The People Next Door," which lasted all of 
four episodes ("Alf" lasted four seasons ). 
</P>
<P>
 He says laughing: "People magazine gave it an F-minus, and called it the worst 
series in the history of television. I've done every series that had gone down 
the toilet." The sitcom disasters and a role in "Ski Patrol" were balanced out 
by critically acclaimed work in theater ("Cheatin' "). 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jordan's turns on the dramatic "Reasonable Doubts" and "Bodies of 
Evidence" were met with success: His recurring roles were expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 23, Jordan will take his one-man show, "Hysterical Blindness & Other 
Southern Tragedies That Have Plagued My Life Thus Far" to the Playhouse on Van 
Dam in New York. The show, which was staged in L.A. a year ago, profiles the 
pitfalls of growing up in East Tennessee, talented, gay and belonging somewhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Jordan hopes that "Hearts Afire's" monthlong return in a 
charmed time slot will help get it renewed. He's "just having a ball," he says. 
"I'm in actor heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hearts Afire" airs Monday at 9:30 p.m . on CBS.

RETRO; REMEMBERING 'HOLOCAUST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen years before the release of Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning epic 
"Schindler's List," American TV audiences were riveted, shocked and moved to 
tears by the Emmy Award-winning miniseries Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday through Thursday, the Family Channel, in commemoration of Holocaust 
Remembrance Week, presents the first national showing of the miniseries since 
1979. Yom Hashoah, the Jewish holy day to honor victims of the Holocaust, was 
April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holocaust" focuses on the intertwining lives of the Jewish Weiss family of 
Berlin and Erik Dorf, a rising member of the Nazi Party. The miniseries opens 
with the happy wedding of the artist Karl Weiss (James Woods), the son of the 
prosperous Jewish physician, Dr. Josef Weiss (Fritz Waver), to Catholic Inga 
Helms (Meryl Streep). Soon we're introduced to unemployed attorney Dorf 
(Michael Moriarty), whose family have been patients of Dr. Weiss for several 
years. Dorf becomes an aid to a top Nazi official and helps cause the demise of 
the Weiss family. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Dorf fights an inner struggle between the loyalty he feels to 
the Weisses and his mandate to find new methods of eliminating the Jews in 
Eastern Europe. The tightknit Weiss family is faced with separation, despair, 
madness and death. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, Dr. Weiss is deported to his native Poland and his wife Berta 
(Rosemary Harris) soon joins him in Warsaw. The two are later sent to a death 
camp. Their daughter Anna (Blanche Baker) loses her mind after being raped by 
German hoodlums. And youngest brother Rudi (Joseph Bottoms) flees to 
Czechoslovakia and becomes part of the Jewish partisan brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was "Holocaust" a huge ratings success, it was nominated for 16 Emmys 
and won eight, including outstanding limited series. Streep, in one of her 
first major roles, won the outstanding lead actress in a limited series for her 
portrayal of Inga. Four years later, she won the best actress Oscar as a 
Catholic Polish concentration camp survivor in "Sophie's Choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Moriarty, late of "Law and Order," received an Emmy for outstanding 
lead actor. Blanche Baker, the daughter of actress Carroll Baker, nabbed 
outstanding supporting actress. Behind the camera, Marvin Chomsky won for his 
direction and Gerald Green for his screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holocaust" airs Sunday-Thursday at 8 p.m. on the Family Channel.

RESTAURANT NEWS: HOW ABOUT A DRAI MARTINI FOR LUNCH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Patrick Terrail closed the original Ma Maison nine years ago, there was a 
lot of talk about where people would be heading for Friday lunch. Doing lunch 
at Ma Maison, or M.M. as the gossip columnists called it, was a ritual, and its 
tables were as sought after as a three-picture deal. Although many have tried 
-- Chasen's, Il Giardino, Picnic, even Terrail himself at Ma Maison Sofitel -- 
no restaurant has come even close to replacing the old Astroturfed spot on 
Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 But Victor Drai, the owner and near-constant presence of Drai's -- who opened 
his La Cienega Avenue restaurant for lunch on Fridays only -- is giving it a 
try. He's got the Rolls-Royces out front. He's got former Ma Maison chef Claude 
Segal, who came to rescue M.M. after Wolfgang Puck left to open Spago. He's got 
several surviving Ma Maison patrons filling his seats: Jackie Collins, Alan 
Ladd Jr., David Begelman, Sherry Lansing, Freddie Fields, Steve Tisch. And he's 
even got Terrail working the room, kissing hands, kissing air, kissing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick was there for me when I opened the restaurant," says Drai, "and last 
Saturday when I was off for Passover, he offered to work the door for me. He 
had such a good time, he's going to fill in for me whenever I'm gone. I'm one 
of the people who like Patrick." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 CHEFS MOVES: Christian Plumail (he was awarded a Michelin star in 1991 while 
at L'Abbaye in La Colle-Sur-Loup near Nice and was voted France's best pastry 
chef in 1978) left Champagne Bis six months ago for Acapulco to open his own 
place. Now the chef is in Nashville cooking at the Wild Boar restaurant. . . . 
Charles Myers, the former chef/owner of the Gumbo Pot and Kokomo Cafe opened 
Big Sky Cafe last Monday in downtown San Luis Obispo.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 ANGEL DUST: Trattoria Angeli in West L.A. folded last Saturday, and now 
another Angel has had its wings clipped, too. Angel's Flight, the high-end 
restaurant that opened last year in downtown's Hotel Inter-Continental, has 
closed, and the tasteful beige-and-ivory third-floor space has been turned into 
a banquet room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GROWN-UP PASTA: 555 East has operated for 10 years as a New York-style 
steakhouse, but now its owners are changing the name and menu. In two weeks, 
the downtown Long Beach restaurant will close for a $350,000 remodeling job and 
reopen a week later as Dominick's East Village, an Italian restaurant serving 
oversized platters of pasta, chicken, steaks and seafood. "The food will be 
served family-style," says a spokeswoman for University Restaurant Group, "but 
that doesn't mean they want a bunch of kids in there." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 DRINKING AND DRIVING: Here's an offer even MADD would approve of. During its 
Happy Hour weekdays from 4 to 6 p.m., City Bean Coffee in downtown Los Angeles 
offers coffee and espresso drinks for half price, which means a double latte 
costs $1.15.

'UNNATURAL' AX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't get it. Christopher Alden says that music critics are not qualified to 
judge his work ("Tales of the Unnatural," by Chris Pasles, March 27), yet their 
praise of his stage direction earned him and Long Beach Opera high respect both 
nationally and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of hand-me-down set designs, it is a great relief to have any new 
productions. Let's hope he comes to town more often.

<P>
 Regarding "Why Don't They Make 'Em Like This Anymore?" by Ann Hornaday (March 
27): 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Hornaday's whole premise spurious (that modern mystery novels of 
the Sue Grafton and Ruth Rendell ilk have something to do with the Hollywood 
cycle of films known as film noir), but she manages to garble several facts, 
asserting: 
</P>
<P>
 * That the movies "Point Blank" and "The Split" were released as "The Hunter" 
and "The Seventh." Actually the books upon which they were based were published 
under those titles. 
</P>
<P>
 * That "The Poodle Springs Story" is the Raymond Chandler book that "started 
life as a screenplay" and remains the only novel of his unfilmed. Hornaday 
meant "Playback." 
</P>
<P>
 * That Jim Thompson "witnessed" (by the article's inelegant implication) the 
recent vogue for his work -- long after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 * And that film noir is "in fact, an entire cinematic genre . . . based on 
literary antecedents." Actually it has far more to do with cinematic 
antecedents as well as prevailing social conditions in America after World War 
II. Its basis in literature, while important, is by no means the crucial 
determinant Hornaday supposes in her utter confusion. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The reason for the dearth of mystery movies based on best-selling mystery 
books is clear to me (and not simply because I am marketing my own original 
screenplay "Silence the Storm" with a like recommendation): 
</P>
<P>
 The new -- and less successful -- mystery films are being done in color rather 
than the native black-and-white that film noir demands. A comment I heard 
recently about Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" summarizes the concept. 
Paraphrasing: "Black-and-white was the perfect choice, as color photography 
would have made the graphic violence too brutal, while also making much of the 
rest too beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Film noir is the embodiment of this ethic. It's a gory world, the gumshoe's, 
and his or her only emotional recourse is a kind of muted numbness. 
Black-and-white communicates this "coolness" to the audience, taking the brutal 
edge off the blood and gore, while likewise flattening those wonderful colors 
on the upside. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, would love to see Easy Rawlins ambling around L.A. or Dave 
Robicheaux flat-footin' the French Quarter. In black-and-white.

HOUSE OF DISPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "The Mystical Isabel Allende," by Blaise Simpson (March 27): 
</P>
<P>
 Rationalizing his decision to eliminate the "magic elements" in his film 
version of Allende's "The House of the Spirits," director Bille August says 
that "supernatural effects in a movie can look ridiculous." Yet such effects 
were used wonderfully well in "Like Water for Chocolate," a commercial hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's minor compared to producer Bernd Eichinger's disingenuous 
explanation for using a nearly all-white, all-star cast: "You need stars in 
this movie because the characters are bigger than life." The filmmakers needed 
stars because they follow the conventional Hollywood wisdom that the moviegoing 
public is largely white and largely xenophobic. Were Antonio Banderas not a 
semi-star name, his part would doubtless have been played by Christian Slater 
or Emilio Estevez or whoever else is young, white and hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cast member Vanessa Redgrave is also disingenuous in agreeing with this, 
claiming that the story's universality is not particular to Chile, otherwise 
why would it be so popular? By that logic, Allende should have set her story in 
whatever country would appeal to the widest audience. She didn't because she 
was writing about what she knew, what was in her guts, which is what any good 
writer does. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that August got Allende to sell out by convincing her it was 
necessary to strip-mine what made the book a good and popular one in the first 
place for fear it wouldn't be a blockbuster. Shame on all of them.

 It is unfortunate that literature by Latinos -- our culture, our spirituality 
and in this case the very way we tell our own stories -- is watered down and 
cast in a sort of Anglo-centric point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always amusing to me that in Hollywood, anything with any sort of culture 
or sophistication must have a Eurocentric stamp of approval.

OSCAR MIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After politely permitting me to rant last Sunday about The Times' unfortunate 
neglect of Deborah Kerr in the issues leading up to the Academy Awards, you 
added after my letter, "An article on Deborah Kerr and her career appeared in 
Calendar on March 21," leaving the impression with your "last word" that I 
didn't know what I was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 This statement is unfair and totally undercuts the significance of my 
comments, but even worse, it is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there were no articles about Deborah Kerr through March 21, the date 
of the awards, and only a brief one on March 22 to which I referred in my 
original letter, complaining that it was completely segregated from the rest of 
the Oscar coverage, placed under a dance review amid lots of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 You chose to cut that portion of my letter for space and in the process 
provided the editors who had incredibly overlooked Miss Kerr all those weeks 
leading up to the Oscars the opportunity to make it appear that I had not read 
The Times carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't The Times just accept the fact that it dropped the ball, without 
dropping the ball once again?

 Where were the stars? For shame. No one may want to go to the company picnic, 
but one always does. It's good for business. It shows your support. It's part 
of the job.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: IS IT ASKING TOO MUCH FOR A CHANCE AND PLACE TO REMEMBER?

<P>
 Genia and Bill Spitzer wandered down Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade 
last week, looking for all the world like the middle-class American retirees 
they are -- in town from Arizona to visit their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spitzers were off to see "The Piano," until they changed their minds after 
someone told them that it was pretty sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a sad one," Genia said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Spitzers had had enough sadness that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of hours, they had spoken matter of factly, in thick Polish 
accents, about living in Nazi-occupied Poland, surviving slave camps in 
Czechoslovakia and Siberia, and about how, even though half a century has 
passed, they hold onto the hope that somehow their entire families didn't 
perish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am still looking, I am still asking," said Genia, 67. "But so far, it is 
almost 50 years and nobody showed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spitzers are home in Tucson today, participating in special ceremonies 
that mark the end of Holocaust Remembrance Week. Their daughter, TV producer 
Perri Chasin, will be with them, making a speech about the trip she and her 
father made to Poland in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to find the place in the woods where Bill Spitzer's parents were 
slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
 All they found was a campground, some picnic tables, a memorial to Polish 
soldiers who died during the war and a sooty plaque inscribed with a few names 
in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they came home, father and daughter were determined that Bill's 
parents -- and those who had died with them -- would not be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill was 24 and living in Krakow when Germany invaded Poland. He escaped 
across the Russian border and ended up spending four years in a Siberian labor 
camp before joining the Polish Resistance. Wounded by a sniper, he finished the 
war in a hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he returned to Krakow. He found only his brother, who delivered 
terrible news: 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me our parents was killed in Niepolomnice, in the woods, with 10,000 
Jewish people that made the graves themselves and was shot in the back of the 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Genia, one of seven children, was only 12 when she was shipped from her 
hometown to a slave labor camp in Czechoslovakia with a trainload of other 
girls. She spent four years there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seen girls die in front of me, from hunger from thirst," she said. "Many 
times I envied them because I didn't know if I was gonna survive." 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, she met and married Bill, moved to Germany, and had a daughter, 
who was 2 1/2 when the family came to America. Two more children were born in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Chasin and her father, now 78, returned to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter wants to know where she is born, so I took her to Germany. And 
when we was in Germany, I think, 'I'll show her where I was born,' so I take 
her to Krakow." 
</P>
<P>
 As the child of Holocaust survivors, Chasin said, she felt the trip was 
important to establish her identity: "You go to school and all your friends 
have cousins. Well, you don't have any. All your friends have grandparents. 
Well, you don't have any. All your friends have pictures of their grandparents, 
if they don't have grandparents. Well, you don't have anything. You have 
nothing. It's like your parents are the beginning of life. There's no history. 
So I felt very rootless, and so I needed to find an anchor, something to prove 
that there was something before us. So we went back." 
</P>
<P>
 To Niepolomnice. Where they were to be so disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Near a campground, they found a nicely maintained obelisk: "For all the Poles 
and others who were killed here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I went crazy," Chasin said. " 'Poles and others ?' Now we're an addendum? I 
was livid." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, that was a monument for the soldiers. They were told where 
to look for the one commemorating the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Chasin and her father found a small rectangular stone with 15 or 
20 names inscribed in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a statue or a monument," Chasin said. "There was nothing on it 
about victims. It was also not well-maintained. The soldiers' monument was in a 
clearing, it had chain around it. This one had years of soot, you couldn't even 
read the names or tell what it was for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Chasin and her father returned to the United States, they began writing 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
 A new memorial would be nice, but at the very least, they would like the names 
of Bill Spitzer's parents added to the sooty stone that they found in the 
woods. 
</P>
<P>
 They enlisted the help of Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center, and even the New York-based Consul General of Poland, both 
of whom appealed in letters to Niepolomnice's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, there has been no response. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Chasin and her parents wonder if there are other survivors of the 
massacres in Niepolomnice out there somewhere, or perhaps descendants of those 
who were slaughtered at the site. They hope to create a group and return to 
Poland to lobby the little town for proper recognition of the mass grave site. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not asking much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to know their ancestors are buried somewhere," said Rabbi 
Hier. "You have a whole generation of people growing up who did not know what 
happened to their ancestors. It would be the right thing to do."

 With picks and shovels, tin pans and sluice boxes, gold prospectors flocked to 
California mountains in 1849 with dreams of striking it rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 150 years later, they still do. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the thing about having gold fever. You just have to come up here," 
said Paul Vandenberg, 37, a prospector from Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandenberg was one of a dozen members of the Orange County 49ers, a 
prospecting club, who recently hunched over a mountain tributary of the San 
Gabriel River above Azusa and swirled water around in his pan. The search 
almost always yields some gold, but never more than flecks worth a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, prospecting is among the fastest-growing recreational activity in the 
United States. The Temecula-based Gold Prospectors Assn. of America has 20,000 
members in Southern California alone, spokesman Jake Hartwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most prospectors say they enjoy the hobby primarily as an excuse to get 
exercise and enjoy the wilderness rather than strike it rich -- although they 
always hope for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I happen to find a big (nugget), great," said Tom Whiteley, 47, of Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a few flecks of the precious metal he has found, he smiled and added: 
"If I don't, well, I've got more gold than you do."

UP ALL NIGHT / HILLARY JOHNSON: IN FULL SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A droll little man in his 70s sips a beer and watches the crowd. Pretty soon, 
he approaches a twentysomething woman with a tattoo peeking out from under the 
strap of her 1940s cocktail dress. This unlikely couple takes to the dance 
floor, where they proceed to redefine swing for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like this every Wednesday night at the Derby, the Los Feliz night club 
that reopened a year ago, restored to its original splendor. And along with the 
domed ceiling, the velvet-curtained booths and the curved bar, a certain 
atmosphere has been revived as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The most accomplished dancers have a signature style -- vintage dresses cut 
off at mid-thigh to show a little garter, zoot suits, suspenders and shoulder 
holster wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Here the re-emergence of swing is more than just another retro phenomenon. 
It's as if the same youth culture that reacted to the inanity of the '70s and 
'80s with slam dancing and stage diving has decided to take control of the 
warlike '90s with style, skill and passion. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems only fitting that the music and dance styles of the Depression and 
World War II years would have particular resonance in this era of riots, fires, 
floods and quakes. The result is less youthful anomie than a kind of carnal 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Naomi Des Pres, resplendent in vintage black crepe, is here for the second 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 "This may sound really cheesy, but I think people really want to get out and 
have good clean fun. It's not about anger or aggression. It's romance, trying 
to capture some glamour," Des Pres says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's seven-piece band, the Royal Crown Revue, plays a signature 
brand of swing -- about half their songs are original. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Eddie Nichols is all hard-boiled romance -- he's pug-ugly handsome, 
with a custom-tailored zoot suit and attitude to match. He grew up in Manhattan 
and explains his move to L.A. with an oblique shrug: "I was 17, I was starving 
and my mom lived in San Diego, so I came out." 
</P>
<P>
 Swing was mysterious, Nichols says: "I started out with rockabilly, but I kept 
digging back and found that there was more substance. I ate it up." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Nichols started the Royal Crown Revue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, it used to sound like a stripper band. It used to be a three-ring 
circus show. I did splits and spins. We didn't know how to play. The reason it 
comes off well now is that we had to completely reinvent swing. We gave it an 
extra kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every number works up to a hard-driving ecstasy, something like the 
energy occasionally achieved by Harry James. Remember "One O'clock Jump"? Even 
the ever-sultry standard "Stormy Weather" whips itself into a hurricane of 
horns as dancers lunge and swirl. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancerly prowess is the only social criterion. Black, white, Latino, young and 
old swap partners all night long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very eclectic," says Tony Gower, co-owner of the Derby with his former 
wife, Tammi Gower. "It's fun to see old people sitting at the bar telling 
youngsters what Hollywood was like in the good old days," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Derby brings out a lot of unexpected emotions in people," Tammi Gower 
concurs. "We wanted it to be friendly, to be the kind of place where people in 
the neighborhood would also hang out. You can come here (and) hear music. We 
have no door policy; we don't pick and choose." 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle of so many couples expertly cutting a rug need not intimidate 
the curious. The Derby offers free swing dance lessons prior to the show.

THE BUZZ: PARODY ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COMPILED BY THE SOCIAL CLIMES STAFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was only a matter of time, we suppose, before the Tonya Harding-Nancy 
Kerrigan story made it to the literature rack of the underground. We refer, of 
course, to the comic book "Whacked! The Adventures of Tonya Harding and Her 
Pals," which has been showing up on racks all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 This enjoyably mean-spirited, full-color parody chronicles the 
going-for-the-gold capers of Harding (who sports a "No Comment" tattoo on her 
shoulder) and her, er, alleged partners in crime, "Ex-husband, current husband 
and future ex-husband" Jeff Gillooly, doughnut-munching Shawn Eckardt and hit 
man Shane Stant. 
</P>
<P>
 It also contains full-page ads of a chain-smoking Harding hawking such 
products as Ice Whackies Cereal ("Whack! Smackle! Pop!"), Cheat-o's ("Leg 
Smackin' Good") and, our favorite, the trademark-protected "Baton'ya." 
</P>
<P>
 While the comic says this is the premiere edition, the publishers don't list a 
city, address or phone number for us to find out what they'll do next (probably 
trying to keep their kneecaps intact). 
</P>
<P>
 Our guess: "Family Values: The Menendezes at Home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Says This Generation Can't Think?: While perusing the announcement 
bulletin board at a Silver Lake coffeehouse, we noticed among the performance 
art dates, rock shows and clubs an upcoming lecture that snared our attention 
with this high-minded query: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why Hegel's Phenomenology ? Why Now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, finally, a flyer that seemed to speak our deepest thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not Just Man's Best Friend: So you think all Fido is good for is fetching your 
slippers and practicing Stupid Pet Tricks? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out this book that we noticed in the crafts section of our local 
bookstore the other day: "Knitting With Dog Hair." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop vacuuming and start knitting!" the cover blurb screamed, beckoning us to 
check it out. Inside were tips on how to collect dog hair, spin it into yarn 
and then knit with it. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked fairly comprehensive, but we didn't notice any instructions for 
making an Afghan afghan or a poodle poodle skirt.

SECRET BEACHES; BAJA; SCORPION BAY: SURF HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hillary Hauser, Hauser is a free-lance writer based in Summerland. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's June and we are camped near Scorpion Bay, in an enormous crescent-shaped 
white-sand cove lapped by glittery blue water. My day has begun as other days 
here, before sunrise; this morning I walked to the lighthouse to watch the big 
yellow ball of the sun make its fiery appearance over the Sierra de la Giganta. 
The fishermen here seldom lag much behind the sunrise, and suddenly the pangas 
, the fishing boats, began leaving the beach for the open ocean, silhouetted 
against a golden sea. A few surfers were up, too, in their camps along the 
cliff, drinking coffee as they watched the morning begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at our campsite, my husband Jim was up, boiling water on our camp stove. 
Bill, a surfer from Encinitas, bicycled out from his camp to see us, bringing 
Viennese coffee to share. At that moment, our dog Minke, a schipperke, caught a 
mouse, beating it to near-death before leaving it behind. I looked at the poor 
thing, then picked up a big stone, positioned it, looked away and dropped it. 
The mouse was killed instantly, mercifully -- but the moment I walked away, a 
road runner raced up, pried the rodent loose from under the stone and ran away 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cove, a hundred feet from our camp, has become our personal beach for the 
two weeks we've been here. The sound of the waves, together with the cool 
breeze and the knowledge that I can throw myself into the water any time I 
choose, softens the heat of the desert behind us. The water called me now. 
Leaving the mouse and the road runner, I traipsed across the sand and, out of 
the sight of everyone, swam naked in this pristine ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I was ready for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorpion Bay is a spectacular front yard for the dusty little town of San 
Juanico, a prosperous fishing community about two-thirds of the way down the 
Baja Peninsula from the California border, on the Pacific side. The bay is 
officially called the Bahia de San Juanico, in fact; "Scorpion Bay" is the name 
American surfers have given it. 
</P>
<P>
 By either name, it is something special. All too many secluded, potentially 
idyllic beaches in Baja have been trashed and polluted, but this bay is 
gloriously pristine. These waters are wonderful for swimming (although swimmers 
are advised to do the "stingray shuffle" to avoid stepping on the occasional 
ray), but it is spectacular for surfing. It is a surfer's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim and I started coming here four years ago, usually timing our trips to 
catch the best surf, in the summer or fall, as late as November. This time we 
had come with our good friends Bruce and Karen Raph, who now joined us for 
breakfast. Afterward, the four of us walked a mile down the road to the bay, 
passing the camps of other surfers who had set up temporary homes in trucks, 
vans and tents along the cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five surf breaks, or points, in this area. The first one is off a 
little island in the bay itself. The rest are actual points of land just north, 
along the shoreline. Most of the surfers camp close together on the second and 
third points and around to the head of the bay, but Bruce, Karen, Jim and I had 
settled two or three hundred yards from each other on the fourth point. We 
liked the privacy, which made it worth suffering the strong winds that come up 
in this spot every afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Above us, on the fifth point, a couple of German tourists, Tillman and Sylvia, 
had established themselves as hermits. They had walked down to our camp for a 
visit the night before, and over Tecate beers we'd learned that they aren't 
surfers at all, just visitors following their noses and a Baja road map. We 
were astonished to hear this. The roads to San Juanico are hellish to 
negotiate, and usually the only people willing to go to the trouble to get here 
are surfers in search of the waves for which Scorpion Bay is known. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers love Scorpion Bay because a southern swell wraps around Punta 
Pequenaand peels off into Scorpion Bay in perfect right-breaking waves -- so 
uniform they look as if they've been generated by a machine. The five points 
stretch for about a mile and a half along this part of the coast. It is said 
that on a good swell, a surfer can ride the full distance, from the fifth point 
all the way down into the bay. (We've yet to see this.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reputation of Scorpion Bay is growing rapidly in the American surfing 
community, but thus far tourism, surf-driven or otherwise, has had very little 
impact here. Over the years, various schemes for developing hotels and 
condominiums have been proposed, but existing roads to the area are tortuous 
and rough, and no major construction has yet taken place. A few Americans, 
mainly surfers, have bought lots in San Juanico (five years ago these went for 
about $2,000 -- today they're about $15,000) and are building unobtrusive 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But other than that, the only new visitor-directed enterprise has been a very 
low-key one: Promotura Punta Pequena, a small company owned by Southern 
California surfers Jamie Atkins, Tom Smith and Dan Clenney, has recently set up 
campsites equipped with showers and restrooms on the cliffs above the bay, as 
well as a cantina selling tacos, cold beer and such. The facilities, built of 
local brick, wood and thatch by local workers, harmonize tastefully with the 
surrounding landscape. The company, which owns a significant amount of coastal 
property around Scorpion Bay (and has a small number of private home sites for 
sale) has also installed large, storm-proof trash receptacles along the beaches 
to discourage littering. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of San Juanico seem to enjoy the presence of American visitors, and 
the little town is a friendly place to visit. Its dirt streets and simple 
houses (some with satellite dishes) are neatly kept, and a church high on a 
hill overlooks everything. There are shops, including a grocery store, a liquor 
store and a hardware store, and an artesian well provides the town's water. 
</P>
<P>
 Those looking for party time in San Juanico are not likely to find it, unless 
they happen into town during a fiesta -- but there are usually one or two 
restaurants, depending on who feels like turning his or her living room into a 
restaurant at any given time. We used to love the huevos rancheros at Gloria's, 
for instance, but on our last couple of trips she has not been serving. At 
another makeshift restaurant, Jim, Bruce, Karen and I enjoyed a delicious lunch 
of manta machaca , a dish of scrambled eggs, onions and dried stingray, which 
we ate with beans and tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juanico's principal industry is fishing, and Mexican fishermen take their 
business seriously, each belonging to a cooperativo that regulates and polices 
the taking of seafood -- especially abalone and lobster. Tourists are not 
allowed to remove these particular delicacies from the waters of Baja, and no 
matter how deserted you think a beach is, the chances are good that the 
cooperativo is watching you. Fishermen will gladly sell abalone and lobster to 
visitors, though. In the old days, so the stories go, locals would trade 
lobsters for Oreo cookies or American cigarettes. We've paid $9 a pound for 
abalone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But crabs and various kinds of fish are fair game for outsiders, and San 
Juanicanos can be generous in this regard. We got to know one fisherman, 
Susanno, who took Jim out on one of his fishing trips. (Gloria, who operated 
the restaurant we liked, is his wife.) Another time, two other fisherman, 
Alvino and Ishmael, came out one afternoon with "fish for Jaime," for which 
they refused payment. Agapito, an inspector from the cooperativo , came to see 
us one afternoon, too -- to see if we'd been poaching, I suspect -- and then 
stayed to play with us a riotous game of Scrabble, in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The beaches north of San Juanico, accessible only by four-wheel-drive 
vehicles, are like scenes from another world. Jim, Bruce, Karen and I took two 
trips in Bruce's truck to the estero ,a vast estuary five miles up the coast. 
To get there, we had to drive up a beach so wild and deserted it was like 
traversing a primitive, mystical wilderness. We passed vultures feasting on the 
carcasses of bat rays and sea lions; just offshore, dolphins chased schools of 
fish at such high speeds that the ocean around them exploded with their frantic 
bursts of energy. Ospreys gathered on the cliffs, while frigate birds scissored 
the air. On one trip, we fished, with Karen catching a corvina in the shore 
break within minutes and Bruce landing a halibut soon afterward. Meanwhile, I 
took a swim in the most crystal-clear sea I've ever experienced. Later, we all 
waded into the estuary and snagged a feast's worth of big crabs with 
monofilament lines. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day spent like this, stepping in and out of the ocean, surfing, 
fishing, then feasting at night on a bouillabaisse of crabs and fish we've 
caught ourselves, it's difficult not to feel very much at peace. Sitting by a 
fire, looking at the stars over Baja, discussing astronomy, the Earth and the 
universe, the simple life prevails. At Scorpion Bay, our entertainment comes 
from the sea, the stars and ourselves. GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Scorpion Bay Watch 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: There is a small airstrip at San Juanico, making Scorpion Bay 
accessible to private airplanes. Other than that, the only access is by boat or 
car -- preferably a four-wheel-drive vehicle in the latter case (though I've 
seen surfers arriving here in everything from beat-up VWs with balding tires to 
fancy camper/trucks). 
</P>
<P>
 There are roads into San Juanico from the north, east and south. The north 
road, from San Ignacio, is poorly marked and often covered with drifts of sand, 
and is not recommended. The east road, marked toward San Isidro, begins at Km59 
on Mexico's Highway 1, about 50 miles below Mulege on Baja's east coast. This 
is a graded, washboard road, climbing up a rocky mountain at one point in a 
hair-raising narrow passage. San Isidro is like a Shangri-La -- a palm-lined 
oasis of pleasant buildings -- after hours of traversing rough, harsh desert. 
After San Isidro and neighboring La Purisima, the road gets narrow, rough and 
mountainous again. The 60-mile trip from Highway 1 will take about five hours, 
at speeds never exceeding 20 miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to drive to San Juanico is the long way around, from the south, 
turning off Highway 1 at Ciudad Insurgentes, 175 miles south of Mulege, then 
heading north to La Purisima. From the highway to La Purisima, a distance of 
about 60 miles, there is a good paved road. From La Purisima to San Juanico, 
though, you're on that same rough mountain road again, and it will take two to 
three hours to drive the additional 30 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever road you travel and in whatever kind of vehicle, it is strongly 
advised that you take a spare tire, a jack, a pump, five gallons of extra gas, 
a strong rope (for towing) and plenty of drinking water, in case of off-road 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Camping out: The Promotura Punta Pequena campground and facilities are easily 
visible once you reach San Juanico. The campsites, which rent for $3 a night, 
stretch along most of the bay; the cantina and restrooms are set back from the 
bay behind the second point. There is no address or phone number for 
reservations, but campsites are plentiful. It is also possible to camp 
elsewhere along the bay and in the surrounding desert, but it is essential to 
bring empty containers for water (obtainable in San Juanico) and a shovel for 
sanitary purposes.

 It's Saturday night, and although my friends and I have spent the day on a 
sweep of golden sand fringed by tall coconut trees, after a dinner of fresh 
fish and frosty Polar beers, we find ourselves drawn -- once again -- to the 
waterfront. Like the locals in this tiny fishing village on Venezuela's north 
coast, we have gravitated to the sea wall where a shirtless drummer bashes a 
wild rhythm on a hollow log while a dancing couple, their hips pulsating to the 
beat, glisten with perspiration under the moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Puerto Colombia, the tradition of tambores (drums) has survived 400 
years, since enslaved Africans were brought to work the cacao haciendas on the 
lushly forested coast. Now, every weekend a lively crowd, some sipping 
Venezuelan rum, gathers under the stars to dance late into the night. Although 
visitors are warmly welcome to watch or join in, this is no show staged for 
their benefit -- it's the way the locals party. 
</P>
<P>
 Puerto Colombia is just one of hundreds of beaches in Venezuela, the South 
American country that boasts the Caribbean's longest coastline. I have been 
charmed by the beaches of Bermuda, the French and Italian rivieras and the 
South Pacific, but it's the seductive Venezuelan strands that -- like a siren 
-- draw me back time and again. They are the beaches of everyone's fantasies -- 
gorgeous, palm-lined crescents. Some, such as Playa Grande, Colorada and El 
Agua, are jammed with bikini-clad men and women frolicking to merengue and 
salsa tunes; others, like Chuao and Cepe, are utterly deserted and so remote 
they can be reached only by yacht or fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides their physical beauty, it's the lively sabor venezolano (Venezuelan 
flavor) of the beaches -- the music, the dancing, the merry-making -- that each 
weekend year round draws entire families from their beds in the pre-dawn 
darkness to navigate the winding, death-defying coastal roads in search of 
pristine surf. In Venezuela, beaches are where students flock for impromptu 
volleyball matches, where couples cavort over games of paddle tennis and where 
extended families throw barbecues and everyone, including grandparents, ends up 
dancing barefoot in the sand.  
</P>
<P>
 International interest in Venezuela as a beach destination is growing, thanks 
mainly to its largest and most visited island, Margarita, about 30 miles north 
of the mainland. Currently Margarita is sold by several U.S. tour operators in 
convenient and affordable packages. Other Venezuelan islands gaining fame in 
recent years among sports fishermen are Los Roques, a cluster of atolls 100 
miles north of Caracas that feature world-class bill fishing. Back on the 
Venezuelan mainland, another up-and-coming resort area is Puerto La Cruz, a 
coastal city that looks northeast toward Margarita and offers an international 
airport, yacht harbors and fancy resort hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 For more nature-oriented vacations, the national marine park of Morrocoy is a 
group of reef-formed islands scattered just off the coast about 140 miles west 
of Caracas that draws boaters, divers and birders. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's Puerto Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 When I lived in Caracas in 1984 and '85, I traveled to Puerto Colombia on 
weekends -- rising early on Saturday to catch a bus to Maracay, an inland city 
two hours west of the capital, where I would switch to a minibus for the 
twisting, two-hour trek over the coastal range. Crammed in beside weekend 
revelers, their portable cassette players competing with the salsas blaring 
from the bus radio, I would gaze out the window in amazement at the surrounding 
cloud forest, where waterfalls washed across the one-lane road and towering 
bamboo trees formed a canopy overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 These mountains are part of Henri Pittier, Venezuela's first national park, 
and close to the summit lie the remains of Rancho Grande, the research station 
where New York zoologist William Beebe conducted his important bird and 
butterfly counts during the 1940s. Beebe claimed he had to wear glasses to 
protect his eyes from the cloud of insects migrating through the Portachuelo 
Pass, a V-shaped dip in the 4,000-foot tall mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 So many insects make good eating for 500 species of birds. Mary Lou Goodwin of 
the Venezuelan Audubon Society calls Rancho Grande at dawn "without doubt, one 
of the rarest, most exquisite experiences a bird-watcher can have anywhere in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But birding is something I have grown into with time; back in my weekend 
beachcomber days my mind was set on finding the most sublime surf the Puerto 
Colombia area could offer. That meant going down to the waterfront and paying a 
fisherman a few bolivares (the Venezuelan currency) to take me and my friends 
to one of the coves nestled at the foot of rocky cliffs or at the end of dense 
tropical forest, and accessible only from the sea. The waves were big and 
rolling, the sand soft and inviting, and you could knock a coconut from a 
nearby tree when you felt thirsty. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite place was Playa Escondida (Hidden Beach), a 15-minute hike west of 
town. I reached it by crossing a little stream flowing into the sea, following 
a trail through the forest and up a hillside dense with brambles, then 
scrambling down a cliff. There's no shade on this little inlet, and the surf 
pounds, but it's a spot where you can be utterly, romantically alone. The place 
is unmarked even today, but locals can give directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, lodging in Puerto Colombia -- a village of a few narrow 
streets -- was limited to the spare rooms of local residents, or the Spartan 
but welcoming riverside lodge of "El Aleman" (the German), a rotund German 
whose Venezuelan wife cooked up delicious meals for her guests. My friends and 
I sometimes stayed in the top floor "suite" of this inn, where the walls 
extended only half way to the ceiling, which was supported by columns, and the 
gurgling stream out back lulled us to sleep. We paid about $15 a night -- total 
-- for this pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1984 a Caracas businessman named Polo Casanova, in an attempt to 
stimulate tourism and boost the slumping local economy, restored a rambling, 
one-story colonial house with a double courtyard open to the sky, pledged to 
hire only locals and to buy only local products -- such as the hand-carved wood 
furniture and the garden vegetables served at each meal. While guests shared 
toilets and cold-water showers, rates at Casanova's Club Cotoperix were set at 
about $80 per person -- sky-high by traditional local standards. But they 
included meals, rum and beer, and local excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 And Club Cotoperix, with its fluffy four-poster beds, armoires and ceiling 
fans, has drawn international visitors to the area. Over the years several 
other entrepreneurs -- many of them German -- have opened their own lodges. 
Nudged by the increasing competition, rates at El Aleman's have doubled and the 
place has been spiffed up -- losing some of its rustic charm in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 But hotel prices become a distant thought after a long day in the sun, a bath 
in a mountain stream and a meal of fresh fish, rice, fried plantains and black 
beans at one of Puerto Colombia's small restaurant shacks. Then it's time to 
watch a dazzling sunset from the beach and while away a few hours over a beer 
at a local bar, until one heads back to the waterfront for tambores . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another area of small fishing villages, protected as a national park, is 
Morrocoy, west along the coast from Puerto Colombia. The towns of Chichiriviche 
and Tucacas, 18 miles apart, are the northern and southern gateways to this 
marine park of mangroves, sea-bird rookeries and coral reefs.  
</P>
<P>
 The low-lying streets of both places are flooded during the rainy season from 
May to November and pocked with dusty holes the rest of the year. As with all 
the coastal regions of Venezuela, there is little difference in temperatures 
between rainy and dry seasons; from the mid-80s to low-90s. In the rainy months 
there are occasional cloudbursts followed by clearing skies. When planning a 
beach trip to Venezuela, I don't take the season into account. On my last visit 
to Morrocoy two years ago, I was amazed to see tourism thriving, with new 
lodges and restaurants springing up on the mainland. In 1984, when I made the 
first of half a dozen forays to Morrocoy, a local hotelier was so moved at 
having a North American guest that he refused to let me pay for the bill. Today 
the same man earns most of his livelihood from foreign tourists.  
</P>
<P>
 In Morrocoy, as in Puerto Colombia, local fishermen double as tour guides, 
motoring groups of sun-worshipers out to the cays of the national park in their 
colorfully painted wooden boats at a charge of about $20 for a group of 10. One 
of the most interesting routes passes through Smuggler's Channel -- also called 
Lovers' Channel -- where bright, orange-red starfish rest on the shallow sea 
floor. Isla de Pajaros (Bird Island) is off-limits for environmental reasons, 
but from a boat one can spot nesting frigate birds, scarlet ibis and tropical 
cormorants. 
</P>
<P>
 At the northern end of Morrocoy Park, best reached by fishing boat from 
Chichiriviche, are seven main cays. Coral-ringed Borracho is known for its 
superb underwater views and is a favorite dive spot with its calm, bath-like 
waters, good visibility, and abundance of fishes, corals, sponges and turtles.  
</P>
<P>
 Other islands at Morrocoy include tranquil Varadero with its sweep of 
palm-lined beach stretching a mile and a half, and the lively Cayo Sombrero, 
where crowds of Venezuelans string hammocks, pitch tents and lounge in racy 
motorboats (although there is talk of restricting anchorage because of damage 
to the reef). Sombrero is the only one of the cays offering refreshments -- 
simple stands selling sodas and snacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Many visitors who aren't prepared to camp stay overnight at small inns or 
hotels in Tucacas and Chichiriviche. Beaches are definitely the focus of any 
visit here; night life is confined to the somewhat shabby discos of a few 
bigger hotels like Mario's in Chichiriviche. 
</P>
<P>
 A decidedly tonier beach resort area is about 150 miles to the east of 
Caracas. Puerto La Cruz, with its long seafront lined by outdoor cafes and 
yachts flying flags from every corner of the globe, is -- like Margarita Island 
-- featured increasingly in package tours from the U.S. The international 
airport in nearby Barcelona makes the area easily accessible to both charters 
from abroad and to daily flights from Caracas and Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a sleepy burg dominated by the 222-room Melia resort hotel, Puerto La 
Cruz now has a proliferation of seafood restaurants, souvenir shops, fast-food 
eateries and sidewalk loiterers shouting English phrases to passersby. The 
waterfront looks inviting but is polluted. The main culprit is untreated sewage 
from the high-rises of the nearby resort complex of El Morro, a jumble of 
sprawling apartment buildings, half-built hotels and time-shares ranging in 
style from Bavarian A-frames to Mediterranean villas. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the mishmash of El Morro, a few resorts stand out for their lavish 
facilities. Perhaps the most notable is the 500-room, low-rise Golden Rainbow 
Maremares, situated on an 18-hole golf course with two lighted tennis courts 
and lavish spa. The hotel has a lagoon-style pool with wave machine; the beach 
is a five-minute walk away. As I'm usually on a tight budget, I always stay at 
one of the economical places in downtown Puerto La Cruz on the Paseo Colon, the 
street skirting the waterfront. Such inns cost $15 and up per night for a 
double, including a private bathroom and air conditioning provided by a vintage 
window-box model. But the real beauty of Puerto La Cruz is to be found beyond 
city limits. Tours depart by shared taxi, minibus and boat to nearby Mochima 
National Park, where one can ride horseback to the remains of coffee and cacao 
haciendas in the tropical forest, or sail to unpolluted beaches such as Playa 
Colorada, Arapito and Blanca.  
</P>
<P>
 Last November a friend and I paid $20 each for a day-cruise out of Puerto La 
Cruz on a brand new 32-foot catamaran operated by the Venezuelan airline 
Aerotuy. The only other passengers on the spanking white boat were two British 
farmers. We dropped anchor to snorkel at a peaceful, coral-rich offshore lagoon 
east of Puerto La Cruz called La Tina (the Tub), and later sailed within feet 
of the coast to an empty beach.  
</P>
<P>
 But Venezuela's most remote and pristine beaches are found in Los Roques, the 
archipelago 100 miles offshore. When I lived in Venezuela, a boyfriend and I 
chartered a crewed sailboat from the marina beside the Macuto Sheraton hotel on 
the mainland near Caracas' airport. Setting sail on an inky black night, all 
was relaxing and peaceful until we hit open sea and endured a grueling 
overnight voyage against the strong current that I still remember occasionally 
in my nightmares. It was like dying and going to heaven when we awoke anchored 
near a deserted white-sand cay, where we stripped naked and jumped into the 
gentle waves.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago I returned to Los Roques on a day trip with the carrier Aerotuy. 
For about $120 each, a group of friends and I flew from Simon Bolivar 
International Airport to the landing strip on Gran Roque, where the 
archipelago's sport fishing fleet makes its home. From there we sailed in a 
motorized yacht to an isolated strip of sand, where we enjoyed a barbecue. 
During the afternoon, someone took $600 from my money belt, left among a pile 
of our beach bags. I had been robbed elsewhere, but never on a deserted island! 
Although most crime in Venezuela is confined to Caracas, it pays to always be 
on guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport fishing business has exploded in Los Roques in recent years, with 
U.S. magazines touting the bill-fishing and tour operators featuring programs. 
I don't fish, but I've heard raves about Los Roques. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Venezuela's best known island, Margarita, also offers its most famous beaches. 
With rates at the top hotels ranging into the hundreds of dollars, Margarita is 
pricey by local standards but affordable compared to many Caribbean islands. 
Charters from abroad and flights from several mainland cities land at Porlamar. 
There are also daily ferries from the cities of Cumana and Puerto La Cruz. (I 
took one once and found it to be time-consuming -- the four-hour voyage was two 
hours late -- and not very comfortable or interesting.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many visitors to Margarita fail to explore beyond the pools of the high-rise 
resorts of popular beaches like El Agua. If they ventured out, they would find 
shady colonial villages like La Asuncion and the historic fortress of La Galera 
where Venezuelans gather to watch the sunset. Margarita was the setting for 
South America's first Spanish town, founded in 1500, and the original settlers 
fished the pearl beds -- margarita means "pearl" in Spanish -- so greedily they 
depleted the supply in just 30 years. Today beach vendors hawk strands of 
freshwater pearls, farmed at the inland lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Margarita retains corners of immense natural beauty, some of the 
island's natural attractions have been ruined by tourist development. Last 
November, boatmen at the La Restinga lagoon -- a wildlife preserve -- admitted 
that most birds had been frightened off by the noise of the tour boat motors. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it's the duty-free shopping on the main drag of Santiago Marino in 
Porlamar and adjacent avenues that draws crowds. French perfumes, designer 
fashions, imported liquors and gourmet foods are the most sought-after 
bargains. I usually spend a day or two on Margarita during my trips to 
Venezuela, but visitors who limit themselves to this island alone are missing a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 For my taste, the lascivious beat of the tambores , the bite of the potent 
dark rum and the pleasant sting of the salty ocean spray are best enjoyed far 
away from people who need the air-conditioned rooms to be content. I can't 
think of a place where I'm happier than relaxing under the palms on a 
Venezuelan beach. GUIDEBOOK

SECRET BEACHES; AUSTRALIA; FRASER ISLAND: 200 MILES OF PERFECT SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN BARON, Baron is a New York free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems ironic that in Australia, a land outlined by endless golden beaches 
and filled in almost entirely with uninterrupted barren dirt, the tourist 
bureau would find it necessary to advertise sand. Yet that is exactly what 
they're up to with Fraser Island: a 100-mile sliver off Australia's as-of-now 
unspoiled Queensland coastline. With a Barnum-like zeal, Fraser (as the locals 
simply call it) is billed as the "largest sand island in the world." A truthful 
proclamation, yet one that also should be taken with, well, a grain of sand, 
considering that sand is only one chapter of the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aussies, after all, are something of an ironic folk. Most were in convict 
shackles when they first laid eyes on their new home. Not that this 
inconvenience restricted the settlers' curiosity in any way. It's said that 
when the unwilling immigrants first encountered the indigenous population, they 
immediately asked in their best Queen's English what those large 
</P>
<P>
 brown animals were that they'd seen bouncing all over the place. The answer 
they received was perhaps the last one ever taken at face value in Australia: 
"Kangaroo," said the natives, an Aboriginal term meaning, "I don't know what 
you're saying to me." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no surprise, then, that a visitor today first places a footprint in the 
200 miles of Fraser's sandy coastline with a sense of uncertain wonder. Given 
the jungle-like rain forests of its interior, the giant freshwater lakes, the 
magnificent sculptured cliffs, the myriad of brightly colored birds, the Willy 
Wonka-esque wildlife (brumbies, dingoes, echidnas, wallabies, dugongs) and the 
conflicting variety of plant communities ranging from low heathlands to tall 
closed forests, the sand can become a simple afterthought shaken out of a shoe 
at day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, one were to allow a little time between visits. Then, the 
true power of the sand would satisfy even the strictest truth-in-advertising 
commissions. For Fraser, one soon learns, is in a constant state of flux. The 
same sand that first created the island more than 100 million years ago, is 
today still burying forests, molding new freshwater lakes, altering the 75 
miles of unsullied coastline and thrusting sand mountains, seemingly overnight, 
800 feet into the southern sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Geographically, Fraser is the perfect middle ground between the urban civility 
of Brisbane, about 180 miles to the south, and the magnificent grandeur of the 
Great Barrier Reef, which begins just to its north. Yet of these three diverse 
points of interest, Fraser clearly would run a distant third in a 
name-recognition contest -- so distant, in fact, that it took the luxury of an 
extended "see everything" honeymoon to steer my wife and me away from the 
majestic reef and toward the rather dubious promise of sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet its relative anonymity is bound to be short lived. Conde Nast Traveler has 
named it one of the 10 best beaches in Australia. And thanks largely to the 
world's ardent naturalists -- who won a bitter battle against Fraser's zealous 
sand miners in the 1970s -- the island has been selected Australia's next 
contribution to UNESCO's World Heritage List. This decree places it on a global 
par with 300 or so other sites including the Serengeti, the Great Barrier Reef 
and the Grand Canyon, as an area to be preserved in its natural state for all 
time -- though try telling the sand about preserving natural states. 
</P>
<P>
 When Capt. James Cook first spotted the island in 1770, he thought the huge 
volcanic outcrop, dotted with hundreds of Aboriginal fires, was actually a 
headland. He called it "Indian Head" without ever coming ashore . . . and then, 
in true explorer fashion, quickly moved on, looking for other places to name. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 50 years for this mistake to be corrected -- and the corrector, it 
turns out, would wish he had never bothered. After carefully circumnavigating 
the island -- with the Pacific on its east, and the Great Sandy Strait on its 
west -- the Scottish sea captain James Fraser and his wife, Eliza, promptly 
wrecked their ship on the island's resilient shores. Some of the group 
perished, but others, including the newly-widowed Eliza, survived with 
Aboriginal help. In fact, following her rescue from the island, Eliza would go 
on to make something of a career for herself retelling of the marooning and of 
her life in the hands of her protective "savages." The Aborigines, for their 
part, met with a fate typical of colonized people who suddenly find themselves 
at the center of newly formed economic equations: Timber cutters ran them off 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a 10-minute ferry ride off Australia's east coast, Fraser is today a far 
more accessible place than it was for Eliza. Thanks to an abundance of ferries, 
tour buses and four-wheel-drive rental companies, there are now basically three 
ways to see the island: a one-day, three-day or on-your-own tour. The first 
requires curiosity; the second, stamina; the third, money. 
</P>
<P>
 The one- and the three-day excursions generally begin at the many campgrounds, 
hostels and backpacker hotels of Hervey Bay, the Queensland town from which 
ferries depart regularly for Fraser Island. Though launches do leave from the 
more distant Rainbow Beach and Maryborough, Hervey Bay is the nearest and most 
accessible avenue to Fraser. This curious mainland town, with an anachronistic 
row of World War II cannons still lining its streets, seems to almost 
physically lean toward the fruitful island. It's as if the overly solicitous 
people who make up its population feel they need to be as near to their fiscal 
lifeblood as possible. Perhaps this explains the cannons. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing to know about the one-day tour is that while you'll 
see a lot, you will experience little. As with most physically challenging and 
diverse landscapes, it is difficult to get a true sense of place when one is 
constantly being herded in and out of labor-saving, time-efficient, 
air-conditioned buses. Finances and time constraints, however, often make this 
the only realistic option. Thus, in order to get the most out of such a 
hit-and-run approach to the island, it is critical to secure the correct island 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fraser, that means an infamous Australian bushman who goes by the name of 
Bronco. Bronco, who knows just about everything there is to know about Fraser, 
takes special pride in the fact that he and his customized tour bus are made of 
roughly the same hulking steel alloy. With luck, or by booking a tour with 
Fraser Venture, you can find yourself in his harbor-like hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day tour is another animal altogether. Assembled by companies 
catering specifically to modern explorers, this tour loosens you to a 
guide-less, four-wheel-drive romp across the island. Unlike those on the 
schedule-keeping tour buses, you are steered only by your curiosity -- and the 
curiosity of the five others with whom you'll be driving . . . and sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, despite its economic manageability (or because of it), this is the 
love-your-neighbor approach to touring (and a litmus test for new marriages). 
With three strangers in a tent at night and six crammed into the vehicle during 
the day -- to say nothing of the Hervey Bay baloney you'll be living off of for 
the next three days -- this can either be a magically unforgettable experience 
. . . or the longest 72 hours of your life. (I quickly discovered that much of 
the enjoyment of four-wheeling depends on whether you sit on the front of the 
vehicle, or whether you hold on for dear life in the back.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obvious demands that come with the camping package, it is still by 
far the most popular among Fraser Island visitors. Certainly, sleeping under 
the stars -- as we did during a sweltering Down Under summer in December -- is 
the most natural way to fit into this rustic environment; especially when one 
can stake out one's bedroom either on a wide-open inviting beach or in a forest 
roofed by such odd looking trees as the satinay, kauri pine and blackbutt. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, usually more expensive, pathway to Fraser involves a small 
assortment of on-island lodgments. Inventively named outposts such as Dilli 
Village, Eurong Beach, Happy Valley, Orchid Beach and Kingfisher Bay are 
scattered about the island and provide accommodations to fit just about every 
need. This includes everything from the modest cabin to the "environmentally 
sensitive" resort that takes credit cards and can do your laundry while you 
busy yourself at the pool, in the shops or even in the conference center. 
Booking in advance is often a must. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how long one winds up staying on Fraser, nature-based recreation 
will always be the key to experiencing the island. Surf, rock and estuary 
fishermen have been known to miss their return ferries following long 
encounters with bream, trevally and wahoo -- to name just a few of the popular 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Herein lies a mystery. As many of the lakes are created (or perched) high in 
the dunes above sea level by trapped rainwater, scientists were for the longest 
time baffled by the presence of freshwater fish in these suspended reservoirs. 
The answer, after much head scratching and extended fish talk, was finally 
found, not in the lakes, but in the sky. The fish, like all shrewd travelers in 
this modern age, simply flew to the island. A stop at Fraser's geologically 
edifying Visitor's Center in Eurong resolves this mystery with an animated tale 
of mainland waterspouts and their rather surprised passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers who come to Fraser soon find themselves confronted with that most 
enviable of dilemmas: which part of the island to explore first. In truth, 
energy levels often give out before most agendas. Nevertheless, big-eyed 
visitors who don't get lost in the 3,000 acres of rain forest usually attempt 
to take in the following: Lake Bowaraddy, where if you clap your hands, 
tortoises pop their heads up to see if you are going to feed them; Lake Wabby, 
which is slowly being engulfed by the Hammerstone sandblow (guides encouraged 
us to slide down the giant sand dune and straight into the refreshing cool 
waters, though they said nothing about the energy-sapping walk back out); the 
Cathedrals, 15 miles of exposed, colored sand cliffs sculptured by the wind; 
the Maheno and the Marloo, twisted wrecks testifying to the island's shallow 
offshore sandbars; primitive Aboriginal sites, some restored to pre-settler 
conditions; a manual lighthouse, one of the last in the world, and Eli Creek, a 
welcome picnic spot as it discharges over 1 million gallons of cool fresh water 
onto the beach every hour. 
</P>
<P>
 For naturalists and animal lovers, Fraser also proves to be both a wonder and 
a challenge. There are more birds here than in all of the British Isles, 
according to the Australia Tourist Commission. Yet in a fine touch of winged 
Australian irony, these same graceful creatures are all but forgotten in early 
August through October, when numerous giant humpback whales arrive at the 
temperate shores after having fled the icy waters of Antarctica. Though these 
salt water giants cannot generally be seen from shore, local operators arrange 
ocean tours for viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not forgotten, but often missed by all but the earliest risers, is the 
spectacular mating ritual of the island's countless turtles, usually beginning 
in late November and lasting until the hatching in mid- to late January. 
Perhaps it was me, but I couldn't help feeling that these haughty little 
fellows actually seemed to perform better when they sensed they had an 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, however, this type of behavior hardly seems unusual on an 
island that is home to the strangest of Australia's many strange animals. Here, 
after all, one can find the brumby, a Swiftian-looking horse descended from the 
mounts of the original British Army; the dingo, that barkless, child-snatching 
dog of lore; and the dugong, a sea cow, of all things (attention Gary Larson). 
There's also advertised pipi, wong and eugarie hunting -- though none in our 
tour could ever figure out what those actually were or if we happened to catch 
any by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that we left empty-handed. By the time our little "stopover" on the way 
north to the Great Barrier Reef had ended, we had managed to come away with 
another, more unexpected prize: Fraser Island, despite everything the brochure 
was trying to tell us, was thankfully much more than just a whole lot of sand.

TRAVEL INSIDER: YOU CAN SET YOUR WATCH BY AMTRAK . . . 44% OF THE TIME; TRAINS: 
AGING EQUIPMENT AND OTHER PROBLEMS MAKE LONG TRIPS ESPECIALLY PRONE TO DELAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Does Amtrak have a punctuality problem? Ask Lynn Andreoli Woods of Los 
Angeles, who recently spent 11 1/2 hours waiting for a train, and you can 
expect a prompt answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was in New Mexico on Jan. 31 when she learned that because of a 
derailment elsewhere, her 3:05 p.m. Amtrak train out of the Lamy station (near 
Santa Fe) would be four to five hours late. By the time her train finally left 
the station, however, that estimate had been severely stretched. The time was 
2:30 a.m. on Feb. 1, and Woods had drafted a complaint about poor communication 
and "taciturn and unfriendly" employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I remain a fan of train travel, I've had comparable experiences, and 
I've read about many more in the angry letters that often land in this office. 
I've also seen the statistics on Amtrak's long-distance trains: In 1993, 56% of 
Amtrak's long-distance trains in the 11 Western states were at least half an 
hour late. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the end of the answer. There's a big difference in on-time 
performance between Amtrak's short and long routes, and there's a long list of 
factors at work in each case. The more a traveler knows about them, the more 
likely he or she will be satisfied by an Amtrak trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Amtrak's long-distance figures do seem to be improving, such as those 
for the popular 34-hour, 1,389-mile Coast Starlight route between Los Angeles 
and Seattle. About 68% of the trains on that route ran on time through 
February. But officials acknowledge that without more federal spending, 
equipment will continue wearing down faster than it is replaced. (Amtrak, 
created in 1971, covers 20% of its costs with federal subsidies, and over the 
last decade has fallen behind in spending to maintain and replace equipment.) 
</P>
<P>
 Track maintenance is a substantial problem, too, Amtrak leaders say -- in part 
because, of the 25,000 miles of track Amtrak uses nationwide, more than 24,000 
is the property of privately owned railroad companies. Generally, freight 
operations are the core of those companies' business. Amtrak officials say the 
timeliness of passenger trains often suffers because they must compete with 
thick freight traffic or because track conditions limit speeds. (Southern 
Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney, however, noted that just 10 of the 1,200 miles 
of Southern Pacific-owned track between Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., are 
affected by track-related "slow orders" that reduce train speeds.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, it's no wonder that Gena Holle, editor of the International 
Railway Travel Newsletter, finds her well-traveled subscribers "not too 
thrilled with Amtrak." 
</P>
<P>
 For Amtrak travelers within Southern California, the picture is different. 
Amtrak records show that in January, the San Diegan route between Santa Barbara 
and San Diego carried 574 trains, of which 87.5% arrived within 10 minutes of 
their scheduled time. Numbers were comparable in February, and between Los 
Angeles and San Diego, the on-time figures were even higher. For the last 
several months, Amtrak's local trains have been "doing great," said Lee 
Bullock, general superintendent for Amtrak's western division. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the catch. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 28, the Metrolink commuter system added two trains and lengthened the 
route of another on the route between Los Angeles and Oceanside, advancing the 
cause of public transportation but further crowding tracks that 10 years ago 
carried half as much passenger traffic. With the new traffic comes a variety of 
route improvement projects -- works in progress that will eventually yield more 
efficient service. But over the intervening year or so, rail authorities 
acknowledge, Amtrak timeliness is likely to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 How much? No one is certain. Amtrak's Bullock said the next several months 
pose "formidable challenges" to the line's staff and timetable. Metrolink 
spokesman Peter Hidalgo sounded a more muted warning, acknowledging that rail 
travelers may face "a minor inconvenience" until the system settles into a new 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce expectations, Amtrak added eight to 10 minutes to its scheduled 
travel times last September. (Current Los Angeles-San Diego schedules allow 
from 2 hours 45 minutes to 3 hours 5 minutes for the 128-mile journey.) 
</P>
<P>
 And to better cope with the heavier traffic, Metrolink last August began 
several improvement projects along the 62 miles of Amtrak-traveled track it 
owns between Oceanside and Fullerton. Foremost of the projects is 
double-tracking 40 miles of single track. Right now, trains approaching from 
opposite directions must do a dance that involves deceleration, turning out to 
a siding, and responding to orders from a dispatcher. By summer, 1995, Hidalgo 
said, Metrolink will lay enough new ties and rails to make up "almost an entire 
second track" along that route. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink will also install fiber-optic communications equipment to replace an 
antiquated signaling system that passes orders from dispatchers to trains. The 
dispatching center itself was shifted on March 28 to Los Angeles Amtrak workers 
(under contract with Metrolink) from an office in Schaumburg, Ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alaska has an intriguing new "cabin" that may have special appeal for train 
buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A refurbished caboose, donated to the U.S. Forest Service by the White Pass 
and Yukon Railroad, is now available as a camping facility for $20 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the caboose was part of a train that carried lead and zinc over 
the White Pass to Skagway. When the Yukon mines closed, the caboose was 
retired. Now repainted and refurbished to accommodate six, it rests at the 
trail head of the Denver Glacier Trail, about five miles and a 15-minute train 
ride from downtown Skagway. Visitors must bring their own bedding and cooking 
gear. For reservations, contact the U.S. Forest Service Information Center, 101 
Egan Drive, Juneau, Alaska 99801. 
</P>
<P>
 And new this year, the historic White Pass and Yukon Railroad has joined the 
AlaskaPass program, which allows visitors unlimited travel on three rail 
services, the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system and four motor coach lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting May 15, the passes will be good for eight days ($499), 15 days

SHOPPING: NEPAL AND INDIA; HUES OF THE HIMALAYAS; MONKS HAVE USED THEM AS 
RELIGIOUS ICONS FOR CENTURIES BUT THESE INTRICATE AND MYSTICAL PAINTINGS ARE 
ALSO STRIKING WORKS OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL DUNCAN, Duncan is a Victoria, British Columbia, free-lance writer. 
Research for this story was also contributed by Maria Horback, who is an art 
historian specializing in south Asian art. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exploring Himalayan art on a university grant, we are in the Lahaul Valley of 
northern India, resting on a footbridge flowing with prayer flags. High above 
us the Kardang monastery sits in splendid isolation. A Buddhist monk who paints 
thangkas lives there , and we want to see him. The climb will take all morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11,500 feet, roses and artemesias have given way to alpine flowers and 
grass. The summer sun stings, but the shadows beneath the monastery are chill. 
A red-robed monk greets us in the courtyard and shows us into the sanctuary. 
Statues of Buddhist saints crowd the altar. Draped with white prayer gauze and 
lit only by a yak butter lamp, they look like ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stairs lead up to the sunlit meditation room. Ancient thangkas (pronounced 
"tang-ka," a Tibetan word meaning painted scroll) hang on the walls. Many are 
framed in brocaded silk: Buddhas, meditating saints, astonishing mandalas, 
fearsome deities. Exquisite as Chinese art, exotic as a lost kingdom in the 
Himalayas. My friend and writing partner, Maria, and I step up for a closer 
look and fall under their spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Smooth to the touch, thangkas are painted not in oils but in powdered pigments 
mixed in a glue solution, flexible and durable yet allowing laser-sharp detail 
with striking color. Thangkas were designed to travel and the thin canvas may 
be rolled and unrolled many times without harm. Itinerant monks have used them 
as visual aids among the illiterate since the 8th Century. They are found 
throughout the Himalayan region. 
</P>
<P>
 We recognize the traditional "Life of Buddha" thangkas , each depicting the 
eight important stages of Gautama Buddha's life arrayed in groups around a 
central, serene Buddha. Many thangkas have a central figure. We see mandalas, 
for instance, which surround a central figure cradled in a geometric circle 
with intricate details -- all of which is contained within a square. Mandalas 
are sacred aids to meditation that are meant to take the viewer closer to the 
attributes of the deity within the circle. 
</P>
<P>
 As we browse, our artist-monk, looking quite stylish in robe and sunglasses, 
hurries into the room. He has been learning to sculpt dragons in wet cement, he 
says, catching his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Poljo Largey is a local man in his early 40s who has lived at the monastery 
and practiced thangka painting since he was 11. His favorite subject is 
Padmasambhava, the bodhisattva who brought Buddhism to the Himalayas in the 8th 
Century.

 "I paint mainly in the winter when deep snow covers the monastery," Largey 
tells us in English. "Then there are less chores, and I have more time." He 
prefers having eight full hours of quiet, but in any case needs three to four 
hours minimum without moving, he says. Thangkas can often take several months 
to complete. A single-hair brush is used for drawing the forms and finishing 
details. This takes great calm and concentration. "My sessions always begin 
with meditation and visualization . . . and because of the technique and type 
of pigment, a false line cannot be hidden." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if he does make a mistake when a thangka is almost finished? 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there is no thangka, " he says, without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting cross-legged on the wooden floor, the monk shows us a series of 
Padmasambhava thangkas he painted the previous winter. Each depicts one of the 
12 historical manifestations of the saint, and all are for sale. The money 
($100 each) goes to support the monastery. We choose two. They are unsigned. He 
explains that thangka artists by tradition never sign their paintings. Because 
it is religious art, the artist does not wish to aggrandize himself by placing 
his name on it. If there is a name on the back, it is the seal of the monastery 
where the work was made. He rolls the thangkas tightly for us and we slip them 
into our backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later we are in Katmandu where art from around the Himalayas can be 
found. Rickshaws, motorcycles, touts and tourists meander along medieval 
streets. Every few feet there is an ancient statue or shrine worthy of a 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Katmandu loves tourists, and tourists, it seems, have found out about 
thangkas. Hundreds of shops offer every kind and quality of thangka . A heavy 
concentration of thangka shops is found on the little street that leads from 
Taleju Temple in Durbar Square to Indra Chowk in the old town section of 
Katmandu. We choose one at random and duck inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop is full, floor to ceiling. We see Padmasambhava thangkas that are 
slick and professional. I think of our Kardang thangkas : simpler, more 
provincial, but perhaps more pious. Arrayed among "Life of Buddha" thangkas are 
green goddesses, lusty Tantric gods with voluptuous consorts, red-eyed demons 
with skull necklaces and meditating saints. The selection is overwhelming. We 
ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Manoj Kumar, who runs the shop for his father, places a painting on the 
counter and hands me a magnifying glass. The Green Tara, for instance, is one 
of the most important deities in Tibetan Buddhism, he explains. She is the 
great savior, always ready to descend to earth to bring help. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequently depicted deity in thangkas, he says, is the 
"thousand-armed" Avalokitesvara. He is the bodhisattva (one who has attained 
Buddhahood but who has elected to remain in this world to help others) of 
kindness and compassion. Having multiple heads and arms -- each hand with an 
all-seeing eye in the palm -- he is omnipotent. Kumar takes down a mandala with 
Avalokitesvara as its central figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-headed form, hardly three inches tall with all his heads, is stunning. 
Multiple arms fan out like butterfly wings. Each arm has a tiny hand with five 
microscopic fingers. An eye stares out of each palm. I bend close with the 
lens, shamelessly looking for a mistake. A missing finger? How can anyone paint 
125 arms without a mistake? This is considered a good quality "tourist 
thangka." Its price is about $225, but others start at less than $10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy percent of sales are to the tourists," Kumar says, gesturing to the 
walls around him. "We have to have cheap ones, because most people do not know 
what a thangka is and do not take the time to learn." But prices can quickly 
rise into the hundreds and bargaining is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "People expect to bargain in Katmandu these days. And bargaining will often 
bring the price down. But for my best thangkas, there is no bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
 And where are they? "Upstairs," he says, with a smile. "Do you want to see?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A back-street door leads to the bright upstairs room. We remove our shoes and 
he unlocks a sturdy chest. Kumar spreads a thangka on the immaculate linoleum 
floor and places glass weights on the corners. It is a "Life of Buddha" 
thangka, one of the most popular designs. It depicts the entire life of Buddha. 
He hands us the obligatory magnifying glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the expressions," he says, "the eyes. Notice the details, even minor 
ones in the corners." As the glass passes over the canvas, the tiny figures 
come alive, each individualized by the masterful touch of a one-hair brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Our hearts are taken by this "Life of Buddha," but now he shows us another. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a traditional design simply called "Buddha thangka. " It contains 208 
figures of Buddhas surrounding a central Buddha sitting in the teaching 
position, with his right palm facing out, fingers pointing down. It represents 
a vision of the 1,000 Buddha worlds, impressive but a bit too geometric and 
dense for Western sensibilities. Kumar quickly covers it with another. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one took 25 months to finish. It tells the legend of Manjusri draining 
the waters of the lake to form the Katmandu Valley." As we gaze at the 
three-by-four-foot canvas on the floor we realize that Kumar has saved his best 
for last. 
</P>
<P>
 Manjusri, found in paintings and statues everywhere in Katmandu, is the 
popular manifestation of justice and wisdom. We see the colorful saint, in 
flowing robes with sword upraised, surrounded by snowy peaks of the Himalayas. 
Down to the tiniest forest creature, it is alive with artistic mastery. We fall 
in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The price, $900, seems almost trivial when compared to art prices in the West. 
Almost. Reluctantly we ask him to roll it up. We want another look at the "Life 
of Buddha." Kumar sends out for some cold Cokes. His fixed price is $650 but -- 
just for this day -- he will take off $25. We take it. 
</P>
<P>
 That "Life of Buddha" thangka now hangs on the wall above our desk. Like the 
exotic part of the world it comes from, it is so packed with imagery that each 
time the eye looks it over, it finds something new. GUIDEBOOK

 In Katmandu: Numerous thangka shops are to be found along the street called 
Makhan Tole (part of the 7th-Century trade route that ran from Lhasa, Tibet, to 
India's Ganges plain) between the Taleju Temple and Indra Chowk. Shops are also 
found in the Thamel area along Tridevi Marg as it turns north past the 
Kathmandu Guest House, and in the tourist hotel area along Durbar Marg (try the 
lobby of the Yak & Yeti Hotel).

BOOKS TO GO: COSTA RICA, IMMEDIATE AND TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 COSTA RICA: The Last Country the Gods Made, photography by Kimberly Parsons, 
text by Adrian Colesberry and Brass McLean (SkyHouse Publishers, $35 hardcover) 
and COSTA RICA: A Traveler's Literary Companion, edited by Barbara Ras 
(Whereabouts Press, $12.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Countries come in and out of fashion. At any given time, certain destinations, 
just like certain actors or certain restaurants, are "hot" and certain ones are 
not. Costa Rica has been simmering for some time now. Guidebooks to the place, 
often emphasizing the richness of its flora and fauna and suitability for 
so-called "eco-tourism," have been showing up regularly in the United States 
for the past few years, helping to introduce Americans to this attractive 
little country down near the tail of Central America. Now, with the appearance 
of a slim but handsome hardcover collection of photographs and a stout little 
paperback filled with good writing about the place, Costa Rica ought to have 
arrived officially in this country's consciousness as an Important Destination. 
It certainly isn't the fault of these books if it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 With her stylish, moody images, landscapes, waterscapes, portraits both eerie 
and engaging, shots of fruit and birds and street scenes, Kimberly Parsons 
evokes a lovely if apparently difficult land. Science writer Adrian Colesberry 
and journalist Brass McLean provide not the usual picture-book fluff but rather 
a straightforward description of the Costa Rican ecosystem, liberally accented 
with notes on history, politics, archeology, etc. The result is more 
illumination than whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Traveler's Literary Companion" devoted to Costa Rica, the first offering 
from a new Bay Area publishing house, is not the usual collection of sketches 
of a place by famous international writers (P.J. O'Rourke on the local 
plumbing, Ernest Hemingway on getting drunk in San Jose, that sort of thing). 
Instead, it is a digest of 20th-Century Costa Rican fiction, stories of 
peasants and jet-setters, lovers and fighters and fools. For the potential 
traveler to Costa Rica, it offers an approach to the country and its people and 
its spirit that is perhaps oblique, but that seems immediate and true. 
</P>
<P>
 WILD FRANCE, edited by Douglas Botting, and WILD ENGLAND by Douglas Botting 
(Sierra Club Books, each $16 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 According to Douglas Botting, the new Sierra Club Natural Traveler Series -- 
of which these are the debut volumes -- is devoted to "embattled refuges of 
wildness and wet: the wild places of Europe." Botting, who is both the series 
editor and the principal author of one of these first two volumes (and who is 
the author of a well-received biography of the German naturalist and explorer 
Alexander Von Humboldt), admits that he has not tried to construct 
comprehensive guidebooks here, nor books addressed to the specialist -- the 
diver, the orchid-hunter, the cross-country skier. Instead, he says, the books 
are intended for "the general outdoor traveller including the expert outside 
his field of expertise (the orchid-hunter in a cave, the diver on a mountain 
top)." With that intention, they seem to do a good job. They cover national 
parks, mountain fastnesses, out-of-the-way beaches and more. They are clearly, 
almost crisply written, handsomely designed and illustrated and offer at least 
bare-bones practical information for the traveler.

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: WHEN LUGGAGE BECOMES A PAIN IN THE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever Annette Swezey took a trip, she would wait until the last minute to 
pack, stuffing clothes and other necessities into a suitcase flung open on the 
bed. She would reach into her closet and then bend over the suitcase, again and 
again, into the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as inevitable as her 11th hour pack-a-thon was the back pain that struck 
at the start of each trip. "I was beginning to think it was psychological," she 
said. Then Swezey, a health educator, and her husband, back specialist Dr. 
Robert Swezey, stepped back and looked at the big picture. Packing mechanics -- 
or rather the lack of them -- were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 So they made proper packing techniques a topic covered on educational tours of 
the model motel bedroom and bath in the Arthritis & Back Pain Center at the 
Swezey Institute in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 45-minute tour, travelers with back problems are taught how to hang 
clothes in a closet without hurting their backs, how to lift suitcases easily 
and how to endure long airplane or train trips. They also learn the best 
first-aid techniques for backs that give out despite such preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Travel is a real troublemaker for people who have had back problems in the 
past," said Robert Swezey, a UCLA clinical professor of medicine. Dr. Ian 
Armstrong, chief of neurosurgery at Century City Hospital, agrees. He receives 
many calls from patients complaining of back pain, both after a trip and even 
long distance during travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the back should begin, Robert Swezey tells patients, when travelers 
call for reservations. When booking a hotel, request a room with a firm 
mattress. And if traveling by air, ask for an aisle seat, preferably one near 
an exit, or for a bulkhead seat to maximize legroom, which can help to ease 
pressure on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 During a long trip by train, bus or air, occasionally walk around and stretch. 
"Get up every hour on a long flight, even if you have no discomfort," Armstrong 
tells patients. 
</P>
<P>
 If traveling by auto, adjust the seat so that knees are level with hips, 
Armstrong said. Sit closer to the steering wheel so that arms are bent at your 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 When packing, kneel down if the suitcase is at bed level, but it is easier on 
the back to pack a suitcase that is at card table or bureau height, Annette 
Swezey said, since that position minimizes bending. Pack two lighter suitcases 
rather than one heavy one to create more equal distribution of weight for 
carrying. Consider taking a lightweight luggage dolly. Robert Swezey recommends 
this over a suitcase with wheels, which he finds can jam and lurch. If airport 
luggage carts are available, use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the hotel or motel, avoid using fold-out luggage holders that usually 
require bending to unpack and pack. Before hanging clothes in a closet, 
remember the phrase "Feet first and face it," the Swezeys tell travelers. That 
stance will reduce twisting of the spine, which can lead to injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the front desk for extra pillows and use one or two between or under the 
knees to increase comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Take along a cold pack in case back pain strikes. A portable, fold-up 
footstool can also make long rides more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hotel bathroom, place toiletry articles up high to decrease the number 
of times it is necessary to bend over. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite best efforts, some travelers still experience back pain. For immediate 
first aid, Robert Swezey advised: lie down as soon as possible, ice the painful 
area and rest it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Limit activity and take anti-inflammatories like Motrin and Advil," Armstrong 
said. "During the acute phase of the injury, ice is best because it reduces 
swelling." Once pain has subsided, heat can be applied to increase blood flow 
to the area and further reduce pain, he said.

GEAR & GADGETS: AUTO-ANSWERS FOR LAND TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I love car trips. It's such a luxury to be spared the luggage limits inherent 
in air travel. When I head out by auto, I take along all sorts of little extras 
to add pleasure, convenience and safety to the experience -- after all, there's 
always room for one more gizmo in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are several nifty items for car travel. Except where noted, prices 
do not include postage and handling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't drive anywhere without a cup of hot coffee at hand, and I've tried all 
kinds of containers to make sure the brew winds up in my mouth instead of all 
over my lap or the car floor when I hit a bump or pothole. 
</P>
<P>
 Mug 1 is a 12-ounce thermal (hot or cold) plastic mug has a screw-on lid with 
a thumb-operated mechanism that opens two drinking holes in the lid. The holes 
accommodate both left- and right-handed users. To keep the mug in place when 
not in use, there is a plastic base with a rubber bottom to prevent sliding. 
</P>
<P>
 For extra stability, there's a Velcro strip for affixing the base to a smooth 
surface, as well as a removable bracket that allows the base to be secured to 
the passenger seat when not in use. I've yet to make a mess with the Mug 1, and 
on occasions when I don't have the cup on hand, I use the base to hold coins 
for toll plazas.  
</P>
<P>
 Mug 1 with base is $20 from Zelco; tel. (800) 431-2486. * 
</P>
<P>
 While on the road, I like to have a safe place to stash spare keys and 
emergency cash, but I'm nervous about relying on those magnetized little cases 
that snap under the car. An innovative solution is the locking gas-cap key safe 
(pictured on L1), available from Frontgate, a mail-order company. 
</P>
<P>
 Suitable for most car makes (check before ordering), the screw-on metal 
gas-cap has a concealed plastic compartment for storing an extra key and some 
emergency cash. You set the three-digit combination lock on the lid. The 
locking cap not only provides a safe storage space, but adds security for tanks 
on cars without locking gas-caps.  
</P>
<P>
 What about cars that have an indoor driver's-side lever for opening the flap 
covering the gas-cap? The gas-cap's operating manual shows how to adjust a 
lever inside the flap so it can be opened from the outside with a credit card. 
But beware: If you forget the combination, you may need a locksmith to remove 
the cap.  
</P>
<P>
 Gas Cap Key Safe (item 1834) is $19.95 from Frontgate; tel. (800) 626-6488.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both for security reasons and the hassle factor, it's good to be able to get 
into a locked car or a motel door as quickly as possible. But a dark night can 
foil a key -- especially when you're driving an unfamiliar rental car. Happily, 
this small, lightweight key holder has a red beam that turns on with the flip 
of a switch, illuminating the key and keyhole. The little lamp is run by a 
replaceable, five-year lithium battery (included). I've been grateful for this 
item many times on the road; I sometimes use it as a kind of 
ultra-mini-flashlight to find tiny things at the bottom of my purse or on the 
dark car floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Velco Keylight (41004) is $19 from Flax Art & Design; tel. (800) 547-7778. * 
</P>
<P>
 A car always should be stocked with basic emergency items: jumper cables, a 
flashlight, a tire-pressure gauge for use when changing a flat, and an ice 
scraper for cold-weather travel. Now all of these items come inside a zippered 
Leatherette case that fits compactly under a seat or in the trunk. I've packed 
this kit in my airplane-checked baggage on trips during which I would be 
renting a car for a substantial amount of time and wanted to be sure I was 
prepared for an emergency. On several occasions, the tools came in handy -- 
particularly the jumper cables, which once saved me from needing a costly and 
time-consuming tow in the mountains of Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
 Compact Roadside Emergency Kit ( 726728) is $27.98 from Lillian Vernon, a 
mail-order company; tel. (800) 285-5555. * 
</P>
<P>
 How will passing motorists know you're in trouble when you're pulled up on the 
side of the road? Enter Emergency Car Signs, the creation of a Kansas company 
called Ready-Set-Go. 
</P>
<P>
 Four folding, 23-inch-by-4-inch strips of bright yellow cardboard are printed 
on both sides with words that pair to spell out Send Police, Send Help, Send 
Gas, Send Tow, Send Medic, Send Mechanic and Gone for Help. Double-sided 
adhesive stickers are included for attaching the signs to windows, inside or 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Also enclosed is a self-protection guide that enumerates circumstances under 
which motorists could become crime victims. It provides security tips for 
dealing with high-risk situations such as car breakdowns, walking to your car 
in a dark parking lot, and auto accidents. I found the tips frighteningly 
insightful; thus, I probably will be a lot more safety conscious -- albeit 
paranoid -- in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 Emergency Car Signs and Self-Protection Guide packet is $6 (including shipping 
and handling) from Ready-Set-Go, P.O. Box 6415, Shawnee Mission, Kan. 66206.

TAKING THE KIDS: WHERE THERE'S SMOKEY, THERE'S FIRE SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The badly burned black bear cub was clinging to a charred tree limb, terrified 
after the devastating fire in New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters -- who themselves barely escaped the May, 1950, blaze -- found 
the little bear and carried him back to their camp. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the cub's badly burned feet and singed fur had begun to heal, he 
had a new name -- Smokey Bear -- and a mission: He would be the real-life 
counterpart of the fictional character created six years earlier for a national 
fire prevention campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 This year marks the 50th anniversary of that first Smokey Bear ad campaign and 
celebrations are planned everywhere. Families traveling around the country can 
teach their children the importance of respecting nature through careful 
tending of her resources. "We see the anniversary as a way to reinforce 
Smokey's message for those who got it growing up and to reach kids who may not 
know Smokey," explained Nancy Porter, a U.S. Forest Service fire prevention 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest officials note that growing numbers of families are taking to the woods 
each year to camp and hike -- and that there were nearly 300 million visits to 
national forests in 1992 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether camping or during hotels stays, parents can teach their children fire 
safety when they're traveling. Here's a tip from one Chicago Fire Department 
official: "I always make sure my kids know where the staircase in a hotel is 
and how to get down," he said, explaining that children should be taught never 
to enter an elevator when there's smoke or fire in a building. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a good idea to have a place for the family to meet outside a hotel, 
in case of a fire or emergency, officials note. "It's really common sense," the 
Chicago fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokey will be spreading the fire safety word everywhere this spring and 
summer. Look for him at the Indianapolis 500 in May, the Special Olympics-UCLA 
in Los Angeles in June, the World Cup Soccer Championships in Pasadena in July 
and the Wisconsin and Ohio State Fairs in August. In Capitan, N.M. -- where 
Smokey Bear was found and where he's buried -- there will be a Fourth of July 
weekend rodeo. A giant Smokey balloon will fly at festivals in New Mexico and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 A day-long celebration is planned for Aug. 9 -- Smokey's "official" birthday 
-- on the National Mall in Washington D.C., complete with puppet shows, fire 
prevention games and songs. (Children can send birthday cards to Smokey that 
will all be displayed on the Mall. Write: Smokey Bear, Smithsonian Institution, 
Office of Elementary Education, Arts and Industries Building, Room 1163 MRC 
402, Washington, D.C. 20560.) 
</P>
<P>
 My 8-year-old daughter Reggie and I recently visited the two-acre Smokey Bear 
State Park in tiny Capitan, a few miles from Lincoln, N.M., where Billy the Kid 
once lived, and not far from Ruidoso, a town known for horse racing and skiing. 
The small exhibit in Capitan explains how Smokey came to be -- from early 
sketches through more than 40 years of forest service programming to the 
manufacture and marketing of commercial products. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to the exhibit is a Smokey Bear Museum and gift shop crammed with 
even more kitsch (including different models of Smokey stuffed bears). We 
visited Smokey's grave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 forest fires are started by people being careless," explained 
Larry Bandy, a New Mexico forester and the park manager who showed us around 
the exhibit. Reggie loved seeing the early posters and memorabilia -- from 
banks to books to canteens to hats to shovels. I liked the advertising history. 
The messages were simple but crucial: Douse campfires carefully; make sure 
cigarettes aren't thrown carelessly away; keep kids away from matches and 
fireworks; don't burn trash when it's windy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need Smokey now as much as we ever did," Bandy said.

<P>
 Regarding the letter from J.R.A. Borrie ("Offended," March 27): J. R. A. 
Borrie manages to convey more about himself than about us -- his (American) 
hosts. It takes an uncommon amount of chutzpah and breach of manners to flaunt 
one's brash insensitivity as he has done.

 I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your article on Oxford, Miss. 
("Southern Sanctuary," March 12). Should you be back that way, I would make 
some suggestions: First, visit the building not far from the Student Union at 
Ol' Miss to see the stained-glass window in memorial to the "Mississippi 
Grays," a Confederate unit from the university whose members all died at 
Gettysburg.Second, if you should return to Holly Springs, have a hamburger at 
Phillips Grocery Store "out by the railroad tracks" -- once listed by USA Today 
as having the best hamburgers in the country. Finally, on your drive from 
Memphis to Oxford on Highway 78, between Olive Branch and Byhalia, take the 
Ingram Mills Exit and go 6.3 miles south on Red Banks Road, then enjoy a great 
catfish dinner at the Chatterbox.

leave." I am not surprised that someone who is probably accustomed to 
California's race riots and racially motivated assaults would find racial 
tolerance "astonishing."

 The letter writer who was dismayed about the Idyllwild Gastronome's "locals 
only" attitude was right on target (Letters, March 20.)My family has been 
visiting Idyllwild since 1957. It is home to many retired people on fixed 
incomes, and if the Gastronome had to rely on their minuscule pensions, it 
would close in about a week. This little cafe really takes itself seriously, 
but it is a relative upstart compared to other local eateries. For friendly 
service and great food, visitors should join the locals at the Bread Basket.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: REGAINING CREDIT AFTER BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I am in debt and considering filing for bankruptcy. How does one go about 
doing this? Will it hurt me in the future? C.G.K . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Personal bankruptcies are a time-honored way for over-extended debtors to 
wipe the slate clean and start their economic lives anew. However, they carry a 
considerable downside as well: social stigma, financial disgrace and a 
significant black mark on your credit rating. Perhaps you can accomplish your 
goals through alternative measures: simply ignoring your creditors if you don't 
have any property they can legally seize, or negotiating with them if you 
believe you need only a little bit of time to get back on your feet. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do decide to file for personal bankruptcy you should know that while 
most negative financial information, such as foreclosures and loan 
delinquencies, can remain on your credit history report for seven years, a 
bankruptcy can stay there for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with a lot of work and discipline it is possible to rebuild your 
credit within two or three years to the point where you won't be turned down 
for a major credit card or loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major creditors are just as interested in positive credit information as 
negative. They look for evidence of steady employment and any indication that 
you are capable of repaying your debts. The first step, of course, is to create 
a budget that you can and will, live within. Then you must open a passbook 
savings account at a local bank. As soon as you have $500 or $1,000 saved, 
apply for what is known as a savings passbook loan, or a loan that is secured 
by your savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you may not need the loan proceeds, your goal is to show that you can 
repay a loan. Even if you want to, don't repay the loan too quickly. It takes 
about six to nine months to appear on your credit report. Also, be sure to ask 
your bank if it reports this type of loan to credit agencies; if they don't, go 
elsewhere. Remember, your goal here is to establish a positive credit history, 
not to get a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some banks automatically offer their savings account holders a secured credit 
card. If you think you have your spending impulses sufficiently under control, 
you can get one of these cards that will give you a credit limit somewhat lower 
than the amount in your savings account. Use it sparingly and only if you're 
sure you can pay off the entire bill when it arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates of these cards are usually quite steep. Department stores and 
gasoline companies are also more liberal than the major credit card companies 
about extending credit to customers. Get one or two of these charge cards and 
charge some minimal purchases that you can easily repay.  
</P>
<P>
 According to our experts, most major credit card and loan issuers will ignore 
a negative credit history if you can demonstrate two or three years of 
consistently responsible credit behavior. Furthermore, they add, most will 
ignore a personal bankruptcy filing after five years of good behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best discussion of the issues and processes surrounding bankruptcy 
filings is contained in the book entitled "How to File for Bankruptcy," 
published by Nolo Press in Berkeley. The $24.95 book contains all the work 
sheet you will need to assess whether you should file for bankruptcy and what 
type of bankruptcy you should seek. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about credit rebuilding and responsible spending and 
budgeting techniques, contact Consumer Credit Counselling Services at (800) 
388-2227. Another source is "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope with Your 
Debts," by Robin Leonard, also published by Nolo Press. Coupon Savings Don't 
Escape Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Newspapers frequently print coupons for savings on taxable grocery items 
such as dog food and laundry detergent. Sometimes the stores will double the 
value of the coupon. However, state sales tax is applied to the pre-coupon 
sales price, not the amount after the coupon is redeemed. Is this a rip-off? -- 
H.L . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The state doesn't think so. It wants its share of the full sales price, not 
the amount the grocer receives from you. You should also remember that in most 
cases, the grocer is being reimbursed by the product manufacturer for at least 
some, if not all, the discount you enjoy. In reality, the total amount of money 
changing hands usually equals the full sales price. And the state feels 
entitled to levy its full tax on the transaction. By the way, this is the same 
procedure used with automobile rebates. Like the grocery stores where you shop, 
auto rebates are applied after the sales tax is computed on the full retail 
price of the vehicle. Pay Off Student Loan Faster, Save Money 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My son recently graduated from college and will soon begin repaying student 
loans totaling $50,000. The loans are scheduled to be repaid at 7% interest 
over 10 years, but he is considering a repayment plan offering 9% interest over 
a 20-year period. His thought is to invest the extra money he does not repay 
each month. Does this make sense? -- T.P.R  
</P>
<P>
 A. A $50,000 loan at 7% interest repaid in monthly installments over 10 years 
would cost a total of $69,600, with monthly payments of about $580. A $50,000 
loan at 9% interest repaid in monthly installments over 20 years would cost a 
total of $108,000, with monthly payments of about $450. By repaying about $130 
more each month -- or $1,560 each year -- for 10 years, your son can save a 
total of $38,400 in interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, your son would have to work magic with his investments to earn the 
return necessary to offset the cost of paying 9%, non-deductible interest on 
his student loans. The interest paid on student loans is considered the same as 
personal or consumer interest. It is not deductible on federal or state income 
taxes.

DID GREENSPAN SET OFF THE LEVERAGE TRIPWIRE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles R. Morris, Charles R. Morris, a Wall Street consultant, is the 
author of The Cost of Good Intentions, an analysis of the New York fiscal 
crisis. His most recent book is Computer Wars: How the West Can Win in a 
Post-IBM World (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing makes disaster more bearable than having someone to blame. As stock 
and bond managers took metaphorical plunges off Wall Street window ledges two 
weeks ago, they showered curses on the owlish head of Alan Greenspan, chairman 
of the Federal Reserve Board. Allegedly, by raising interest rates just the 
tiniest amount, Greenspan had touched a tripwire, that nudged over a domino, 
that blew open a dam, that wiped away a half-trillion dollars of the world's 
paper wealth. The partial bounce-back last week hardly mollified tempers. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling markets are bad news for beleaguered President Bill Clinton as well, 
who crowed all last year about falling interest rates and rising stock prices. 
The Wall Street Journal, along with most other conservative pundits, refused to 
give Clinton any credit for last year's booming markets, but leaped to point 
the finger at the White House two weeks ago. Consistency, after all, is the 
hobgoblin of small minds. 
</P>
<P>
 What did Greenspan do? The Federal Reserve lends money, mostly overnight, to 
banks. The rate the Fed charges to banks sets a floor on the rates that banks, 
in turn, charge their customers -- for credit cards, for mortgages, for 
business loans. By pushing bank rates up a bit, the Fed hopes to slow the 
economy down a little, prevent inflationary overheating and keep the recovery 
going longer. Greenspan's rate increases were truly small -- a quarter of a 
percent in February, and another quarter of a percent in March. Since the 
previous rate, at 3%, was equivalent to zero interest after inflation, the 
increases hardly seem unreasonable -- after all, why should banks get free 
loans from the taxpayer? 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Greenspan is just a scapegoat. It is in the nature of markets to 
overshoot, and a large number of market professionals had begun to feel that 
the long bull market in stocks and bonds had pushed prices past the point 
justified by underlying values. The fact that market professionals reach a 
consensus doesn't mean they're right. But it does mean a lot of fund managers 
were ready to sell at the slightest sign of anything going wrong. And a number 
of special factors in our post-'80s, rocket-science-based markets can cause 
fierce short-term turnarounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The common man understands the magic of leverage. That's why Californians made 
so much money in real estate for so many years. Buy a house for $100,000, but 
put up only $20,000 of your own. Sell the house for $120,000, pay off the 
$80,000 mortgage, and you have $40,000 left, doubling your investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Leverage works its magic in the financial markets too, but with a dangerous 
twist. If a fund manager buys stocks or bonds "on margin," it means she has 
borrowed part of the purchase price. The lending institution keeps the stocks 
or bonds in its vault as security against the loan. But if the price of the 
securities falls, the fund manager must send the lender additional cash, so the 
loan is always 100% secure. This is a "margin call." If there were margin calls 
in the housing market, the bank that held your mortgage would send you a bill 
for an immediate payment of $20,000 when the value of your house fell by that 
amount, so its mortgage loan would stay fully secured. Margin calls, obviously, 
can be nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional managers can leverage the newest breed of financial instruments 
like index options and futures to extreme degrees, such as 50-1, even 100-1. 
When markets start falling, margin calls against such highly leveraged 
positions can set off a mad scramble for cash. In thin markets for unusual 
instruments, cash-desperate fund managers may find no buyers at any price. If 
Edgar Allen Poe's Raven roosted on Wall Street, it would croak, "There are no 
bids." 
</P>
<P>
 Something like this seems to have happened to Askin Capital Management, which 
trades in exotic instruments based on mortgage pools. Trapped with an illiquid 
portfolio and a crescendo of margin calls, they lost hundreds of millions of 
investor money almost overnight, wiping out their fund. Some of the big hedge 
funds, like George Soros's, had also been forced into fire-sale liquidations to 
meet heavy margin calls, making managers everywhere nervous. It's hard to blame 
all this on Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondholders are natural melancholics -- they like recessions, empty factories, 
bread lines. If the economy is slack, interest rates tend to be low, and low 
rates make bonds more valuable. (What is a bond worth that pays $5 of interest 
a year forever? If long-term interest rates are 10%, it is worth $50. But if 
rates are only 5%, it is $100. Bond prices go up when interest rates fall, and 
vice-versa. House prices work the same way.) 
</P>
<P>
 When voters were pummeling George Bush for the slow recovery in 1991 and 1992, 
bondholders were smiling smugly over in the corner. The economy was at a crawl, 
interest rates were falling and the value of their pile was going up by the 
day. Highly leveraged bondholders wore smiles that almost split their skin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese puzzle of modern economics is that low, long-term interest rates 
mean happy bondholders; but low rates also spur growth and investment; but high 
growth frightens bondholders (for fear of inflation); frightened bondholders 
dump their bonds, so prices fall and rates rise; high rates choke off growth, 
so rates fall . . . And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of so-called modern economic management is just crude psychologizing. 
Greenspan hopes that by raising short-term rates, bondholders will be convinced 
that the economy will not grow so fast as to ignite inflation, and therefore 
long-term rates will stay low. The bond managers clinging to skyscraper ledges 
are shouting he'll produce the opposite result. Thomists and Occamites had 
these kind of arguments in the 14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Greenspan has little choice. After three full years of easy Fed 
credit, bank lending capacity has been rising fast. If banks suddenly converted 
all those potential loans into real loans, inflationary pressures really could 
increase. Keeping money super-cheap therefore makes little sense. What's a fair 
rate to charge for overnight loans to healthy banks? Three-quarters of a 
percent more than inflation? One percent? If so, short-term rates have to go up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sensible world, such tiny moves shouldn't make much difference, and over 
the medium-term, they probably won't. The economy is in as good shape as it's 
been in a while, and may even improve as Japan and Europe start to recover. The 
stock market pays extra returns because stocks are volatile. Investors with no 
stomach for daily ups and downs should keep their money in banks.

LOS ANGELES AND LAS VEGAS; HOW THE WEST WAS DEVELOPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN STARR, Kevin Starr, a contributing editor to Opinion, teaches in the 
School of Urban and Regional Planning at USC. His next volume on the history of 
California, The Dream Endures: California Through the Great Depression, will be 
published by Oxford University Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a tale of two cities, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, inspired by the 
resignation of Robert C. Maxson as president of the University of Nevada at Las 
Vegas. This July, Maxson will assume the presidency of Cal State Long Beach, 
after 10 years of extraordi nary achievement at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 That Maxson will be leading an academic institution in Los Angeles County 
brings the story full circle. For greater Las Vegas and Los Angeles County are 
more than mirror images of each other in their sprawl, their Sun Belt 
exuberance, their tendency to theatricalize everyday life. Los Angeles is, 
after all, the mother of Las Vegas. Between both cities there exist the deepest 
possible parallels. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Beatty would have us believe that Bugsy Siegel founded Las Vegas. That 
is partly correct. The gambler first glimpsed the possibilities of large-scale 
resort casinos in a desert tank town. But Siegel was not the first to do so. A 
decade and more earlier, metropolitan Los Angeles -- the prime mover behind the 
Boulder/Hoover Dam -- energized Las Vegas as the first available playground for 
the construction site. Eastern journalists in the mid-1930s -- including 
Theodore H. White, Edmund Wilson and Bruce Bliven Jr. -- were mesmerized by the 
casinos and bordellos that sprang up in Las Vegas to serve the builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a bit startling," wrote Bliven in the New Republic, "to walk down the 
main street at 11 a.m. and see in almost every block one or more gambling 
houses, doors open to every passerby, crowded with men and women, old and 
young, playing Keno, roulette, poker, shooting craps or betting on horse races 
described by a raucous-voiced gentleman who gets his facts by di-rect wire from 
the track." 
</P>
<P>
 On his visit to Las Ve-gas, White witnessed a scene worthy of Bret Harte. 
Entering the Nevada Bar, White heard above the raucous laughter the sound of 
classical music. "In the toughest place in town," he noted, "a young girl was 
playing Beethoven. A couple of maudlin drunks hung on the piano, weeping. 
Gently removing them, I asked the only female 'professor' what she would drink. 
An orange blossom was made for her -- without gin -- and we talked. She had run 
away from home in Oklahoma, and had banged out her keep on a piano as far as 
Nevada. The ultimate goal was a conservatory in Los Angeles. The Beethoven was 
a lapse, she explained. 'When they get drunk enough, I play it. They don't know 
it, and I get my practicing done.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel and Wilbur Clark (who brought Noel Coward to the desert and thereby 
established another tradition, big-name entertainment) seized upon this 
earlier, ruder identity, seeing in it the possibilities of an American Monte 
Carlo that would draw its clientele, initially and primarily, from greater Los 
Angeles. Without Los Angeles, Las Vegas made no sense. 
</P>
<P>
 In ancient Greece, when a city got too large, the citizens drew lots. Those 
drawing an "X" would be required to go out and found a new city. In a similar 
manner, Los Angeles served as the mother city of Las Vegas. Hollywood, 
including Ronald Reagan, who discovered the Strip before General Electric, 
found in Las Vegas not just a source of ready cash, but a way of playing before 
live audiences, of doing vaudeville with glitz, of making sure the public still 
loved them. 
</P>
<P>
 When historians search for points of transition in the developing identity of 
Los Angeles as a front-rank metropolitan culture, they invariably turn to the 
emergence of the University of Southern California, the California Institute of 
Technology and the University of California, Los Angeles. Few U.S. cities have 
used their two largest universities so consistently as icons of identity, as 
prisms through which to see the meaning of the present and the possibilities of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, for example, has three large universities -- Columbia, New York 
University and the City University of New York -- and a number of distinguished 
smaller institutions -- but none served as the primary mode of civic 
boosterism. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, by contrast, defined each of its epochs by and through a 
university. In its first American phase, the 1880s through the 1920s, USC 
served and epitomized the aspirations for professionalization and 
self-improvement of a region that needed thousands of doctors, lawyers, social 
workers, engineers, teachers. Then, in 1920, the Throop Polytechnic Institute 
changed its name to the California Institute of Technology. Behind that change 
was the transformation, spearheaded by astronomer George Ellery Hale, of a 
technical school into a leading scientific and engineering institute. 
</P>
<P>
 In the postwar era, the UCLA of Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy and university 
librarian Lawrence Clark Powell served, paced and expressed the unprecedented 
boom that was Westside Los Angeles -- which, in turn, expressed the even more 
unprecedented boom of Southern California as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Maxson arrived in Las Vegas, where the leadership and 
population desperately wanted something better; just as Los Angeles had when it 
founded USC, Cal Tech and UCLA. Maxson assumed the presidency of a small 
university -- Tumbleweed Tech, it was called, known for basketball and little 
else -- in an uncertain city where the primary industry had only recently been 
purged of the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard on the Los Vegas oligarchy to have Siegel and his pals among its 
founding fathers. By the 1980s, greater Las Vegas was pushing the 1 million 
mark -- the point where, as urban historian Lewis Mumford explains, urban 
centers begin to become aware of themselves as cities and aspire to cultural 
upgrade. Already, Las Vegas had been recognized for pioneering post-modern 
architecture and was on the verge of creating a whole new generation of casinos 
-- Caesar's Palace, Mirage, Excaliber, Luxor, Circus Circus -- that would shape 
a new form of interactive building (the building as entertainment and 
information system) for the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson instantly understood his task: upgrade UNLV as a means of both 
reflecting and intensifying the upgrading of Las Vegas. He was perfect for the 
job: In his origins (Arkansas), his academic lineage (University of Arkansas, 
Florida Atlantic, Mississippi State), his career path (provost at University of 
Houston), Maxson epitomized the Sun Belt in all its populist vigor, its sudden 
rush to prominence, its deep longing for what the nation's older regions seemed 
already to possess. Through UNLV, under Maxson, Las Vegas sought to put Siegel 
behind it the same way that Harvard and Boston had put behind themselves the 
slave-traders, the rum-runners, the Catholic-bashers and the religious 
hypocrites who had done so much to make Harvard and Boston esteemed and beyond 
reproach. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson raised $100 million. He built 35 buildings, won accreditation for 14 
new programs and 28 new degrees. He recruited top faculty and doubled 
enrollment to its current near-20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he took on a figure of near-mythic importance -- basketball 
coach Jerry Tarkanian. The clash between the two epitomized two sides of the 
emergent Las Vegas: its aspirations for distinction, its love of sport; its 
thirst for respectability and proper procedure; its driving desire to win -- no 
matter the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles, USC maintained a similar relationship to its football 
program. Athletics boosted each institution into notoriety, but each sport 
stood in the way, at least as previously practiced, when respectability became 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson vs. Tarkanian, heroic wills and egos in two self-made Sun Belt giants 
-- it nearly tore Las Vegas apart. But this is the stuff of which cities are 
made: the clash of will and ego, the drive toward excellence, the love of 
creative struggle and the challenge of the fray. The founders of Los Angeles 
had many a Maxson and many a Tarkanian among them. And now Maxson moves his 
flag to Cal State Long Beach, where Tarkanian began his coaching career. It 
isn't over til it's over, whether in Los Angeles, Las Vegas or Long Beach. 
There are still great cities to build.

POLITICAL URBAN MYTHS: RUMORS THAT WON'T DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the strangest part of the Whitewater scandal to date is the firestorm 
of rumor it produced about the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent W. 
Foster Jr. The stories about Foster -- tales of con spiracy, sexual 
assignations and murder -- began simmering right after he died last summer. 
Fueled by government secrecy, they came to a boil this spring in flaming 
tabloid headlines and still hang over the whole Whitewater affair, giving it an 
acrid, sinister smell. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rush of Foster stories was no anomaly. Apocryphal information plays an 
increasing role in common discourse, whether in local news or high politics. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, newspapers and magazines have always run human-interest stories 
illustrating the quirky variety and universal truths of daily life. Nowadays, 
though, this feature is more likely to be called, as it is in Washington's City 
Paper, "News of the Weird." Here we learn that a 35-year-old Colorado man was 
beaten up in a barroom fight, came home, blew his nose and had his eyeball fall 
out. (Doctors repaired the damage.) 
</P>
<P>
 It may be some consolation to know this growing love affair with the weird has 
seized the British, too. There, the journal Fortean Times gathers stories like 
that of the Southampton police who found a severed ear and refrigerated it; but 
when the ear's owner finally called to inquire, he was told the ear had already 
"gone off." "It was next to an egg roll that had gone off as well," said a 
police spokesman, "so there was nothing we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 But America has the lead. In fact, Fortean Times is named after an American -- 
Charles Forte, who, at the turn of the century, railed against the straitjacket 
that scientific rationalism imposed on human thought. Forte may have been the 
first to speculate that those mysterious lights in the sky were alien 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Forte has gained adherents by the carload. In fact, there is 
a comic book, "Urban Legends," that tells three dozen currently circulating 
myths in gruesome graphics. The best known of these modern tales are here: How 
people brought little alligators home from Florida as souvenirs, then flushed 
them down the toilet. So now there are alligators in the sewers, and you'd 
better be careful when you go to the bathroom. Or how the lady with the beehive 
hairdo, which she kept hair-spraying and never washed, turned out to have a 
colony of black widow spiders eating away at her brain. 
</P>
<P>
 For even many sophisticated folks, who think they believe in science and in 
rational explanations, have now developed a dark, baroque, Fortean view of 
American politics and public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the change started with John F. Kennedy's assassination, which caused 
the public to believe that the democratically expressed will of the people 
could be overmastered by sinister plotting done in secret. In the years since, 
public opinion about the assassination has increasingly been ruled by 
conspiracy theories of the most convoluted, Florentine sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Then followed Vietnam, the anti-war movement, Watergate and the coming of a 
more elaborate ethics system to define, uncover and punish public corruption. 
People began to see much more than before about officials' venality and 
sneakiness. In the private sector, white-collar prosecutions became more 
numerous; U.S. corporations were increasingly paraded before the country as 
conspiring enemies of the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The media started to give more attention to the private lives of public 
people, and news consumers learned about previously unsuspected strangeness 
among the famous. The press also increased coverage of bizarre events in the 
society at large: Never, before today, could much of the country have an 
up-close, day-in-day-out look at a spectacle like the Menendez trial. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to say for sure whether there is more corrupt, bizarre, 
inexplicable, non-rational behavior in this country than in olden days, and 
just as impossible to know with certainty whether such behavior plays a 
larger-than-ever role in guiding the country's destiny. There is no doubt, 
though, that we are aware of more such behavior than we used to be. We do not 
merely suspect but actually know that politicians are capable of distasteful 
sexual habits. We know details about the predations of Jeffrey L. Dahmer. 
</P>
<P>
 This increased visibility and disclosure have trained citizens and opinion 
makers to think even a seemingly loony story just might be true -- and that 
anyone who pooh-poohs it may end up looking the fool. At the same time, the 
publicity has discouraged trust in official channels of communication. Rumor is 
the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the new communications have simply put people in touch with one 
another in an increasingly immediate way. For example, stock markets, in 
America as elsewhere, have always been rife with rumor, since their denizens 
make a living from knowing pieces of news just a few seconds before the other 
guy. But now these people are hooked up by phone and computer to the entire 
known universe. It is no surprise that a rumor or joke can begin in the 
fertile, cheerfully demented mind of some bond trader and spread nationwide in 
24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors are fun. They are almost invariably more exciting than the stuff that 
makes up daily reality. Yet they are moving closer to the center of not only 
our casual interest but our public life -- and this is a warning. It means that 
people are not just skeptical about what government tells them but unbelieving. 
It means we think of our world as one where violence and corruption are not 
only possible but probable. And it means that the ever-present human desire for 
excitement is now becoming a dangerous need. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculating about the grisly possibilities in the Foster case has been a 
fascinating activity. But today's myriad rumors are a canary in the mine, and 
they have broken into full song.

FOR ROOTS OF SOUTH AFRICA'S VIOLENCE, LOOK TO BUTHELEZI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Clough, Michael Clough is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign 
Relations and co-chair of New American Global Dialogue, a Stanley Foundation 
foreign-policy program. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In less than three weeks, South African voters will elect their country's 
first non-racial government. This election was supposed to usher in a new era 
of peace, but fears are growing that it will instead spark a civil war. These 
fears are exaggerated. They derive from misunderstandings of the roots of 
recent political violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The current crisis is limited to a small number of areas where ethnic passions 
have been deliberately inflamed. Most of South Africa is peaceful. The armed 
battles and bloody massacres that have recently made headlines are confined to 
Natal, where the intra-Zulu rivalry between traditionalists allied to Chief 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi and those who support the African National Congress 
is most intense. It is also in a handful of black townships in the industrial 
heartland, where large concentrations of Zulu migrant workers live. 
</P>
<P>
 The current battles are outgrowths of Buthelezi's continuing efforts to carve 
out a political role for himself in a post-apartheid South Africa. It is only 
where his followers live that there is a serious danger of prolonged unrest. 
Paradoxically, however, Buthelezi himself may now be a relatively 
inconsequential factor in the larger equation that will determine how quickly 
the crisis can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to his critics' charges, Buthelezi was never just another homeland 
leader or merely a tool of the apartheid regime. If he had been, he would have 
already disappeared from the scene, like the other original homeland leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 From his student days in the 1940s, when he joined the ANC Youth League, 
Buthelezi has considered himself an opponent of white rule and looked to the 
day when he would be among the leaders of a black-ruled South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, he has changed strategies, but his eye remained on the ultimate 
prize of power in a post-apartheid South Africa. Unfortunately, his efforts to 
gain it have created deep divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, when Buthelezi became chief minister of KwaZulu -- the homeland in 
Natal created for South Africa's largest tribe, the Zulu -- he did so with the 
implicit blessing of many ANC leaders. At the time, the anti-apartheid movement 
was on the ropes. Buthelezi argued that control of KwaZulu offered an 
opportunity to use the system against itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of following the lead of other homeland leaders and accepting 
Pretoria's offer to grant KwaZulu nominal independence, Buthelezi insisted that 
his homeland would remain part of South Africa. His refusal ensured that the 
Afrikaner regime's plans never gained international approval. They also 
enhanced Buthelezi's personal credibility in liberal circles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, the revival of the anti-apartheid movement changed the 
political equation inside South Africa. A new internal opposition emerged that 
was bitterly opposed to Buthelezi's strategy of opposition through 
collaboration. In response, Buthelezi began to redefine himself as the moderate 
alternative to ANC radicals. He also created his own political organization, 
Inkatha. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Buthelezi de-emphasized his ethnic 
base because his "Zuluness" limited his political horizons. He also recognized 
that many Western interests and white liberals in South Africa were searching 
for a non-ANC horse to back in the anti-apartheid derby. It was then that the 
seeds of the current violence were sown. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting in Natal began in the mid-1980s, when the United Democratic Front, an 
ANC ally, began to organize workers and youth in Zulu areas. Buthelezi fought 
back -- politically and militarily. He quietly turned to Pretoria for 
assistance. The KwaZulu police soon became an extension of the South African 
military's covert war against the anti-apartheid movement. This irreparably 
tarnished Buthelezi's anti-apartheid credentials. As his chances to become a 
national leader declined, he promoted the idea that South Africa should become 
a federal state -- with power concentrated at the regional level. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Buthelezi's regionalism made him a natural ally of Afrikaner 
reformers, who sought to preserve white influence by pushing for a highly 
decentralized state. But this alliance was short-lived. By the time Frederik W. 
de Klerk became president, in 1989, it was clear that lasting peace would 
require an accommodation with Nelson Mandela and the ANC.  
</P>
<P>
 The De Klerk government continually used the Buthelezi card throughout its 
negotiations with the ANC -- and elements in the security forces continued to 
help Inkatha fight its war against the ANC. But Buthelezi no longer figured in 
the National Party's long-term plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Once agreement was reached on the plan for transitional elections, Buthelezi 
tried again to play a leading role. He declared that Inkatha would not 
participate in the elections and encouraged King Goodwill Zwelethini, the 
traditional leader of the Zulu, to declare their right to establish an 
independent state. 
</P>
<P>
 After all his maneuvers, Buthelezi has lost most of his influence. He no 
longer commands majority support even among Zulu in Natal -- one reason he is 
reluctant to participate in free elections. Groups he once controlled -- the 
KwaZulu bureaucracy, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Zulu nation -- have 
become significant forces that will have to be taken into account in the search 
for a way to end the violence. But Buthelezi is no longer in charge. In fact, 
it is only to the extent that KwaZulu bureaucrats, Inkatha warlords and the 
royal family believe he is still useful to them that he has any hope of 
remaining in the political game. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of these reasons, the keys to ending the current crisis are not in 
Buthelezi's hands. Negotiating efforts that concentrate on finding ways to meet 
his demands will fail. Instead, an attempt must be made to calm the Zulu 
passions that Buthelezi has aroused by reassuring them that a future government 
will not discriminate against Zulus or deny their king Zwelethini his 
traditional role. 
</P>
<P>
 This will require the enlightened statesmanship that both Mandela and De Klerk 
have already demonstrated. South Africans and the international community must 
come to terms with the fact that many Inkatha warlords are unlikely to 
compromise. Forcing them to accept the reality of a democratic South Africa 
will be a long, and probably violent, process -- but it is not likely to 
prevent the country from realizing its hopes for a peaceful and prosperous 
future.

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; MY SEDER WITH BLACKMUN: COURT GOSSIP & MATZOH BALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA S. KARLAN, Pamela S. Karlan is a law professor at the University of 
Virginia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a case 
challenging the constitutionality of Gramm-Rudman. As one of Justice Harry A. 
Blackmun's law clerks, I had one of the scarce courtroom seats. It was terribly 
exciting to look around the courtroom and see it filled with members of 
Congress and Washington heavyweights. It was even more exciting to sit in 
Blackmun's office later that day, listening to his account of how the justices 
had voted on the cases argued earlier in the week. But the real reason I 
remember that day has nothing to do with momentous issues of constitutional 
law. It was because of our Passover Seder. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of the justice's clerks for the 1985-1986 term were Jewish. (That 
year, Blackmun became the first justice to hire three female clerks for the 
same term -- he delighted in being a pioneer.) Every morning, precisely at 8 
a.m., the justice would eat breakfast with us. At one meal, Blackmun had said, 
somewhat wistfully, that he had never been to a Seder and had always been 
curious about it. So when spring came around and the crush of work that kept us 
all working 15-hour days -- including Blackmun, who was then 77, and in better 
shape than the four of us combined -- made it clear we couldn't get home for 
Passover, my co-clerk David Sklansky and I decided to hold a Seder for the 
other Jewish clerks at the court -- and Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun seemed enchanted with the invitation. He even authorized us to borrow 
folding chairs and tables from the court -- though he wondered, mischievously, 
if this might cause Establishment Clause problems if it came to light. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm-Rudman day was a blur of activity. David and I raced back and forth 
between meetings with the justice at the court and our 20-pound turkey -- 
cleaned, stuffed and roasting at the home of one of Justice Thurgood S. 
Marshall's clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, we were exhausted. But we were all looking forward to 
the typical ultra-casual, ultra-Reform Seder: the four questions, the four 
sons, the 10 plagues, some matzoh ball soup and a relaxing dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 At seven o'clock, about 15 clerks, spouses and companions gathered for the 
Seder. Soon the Justice and Dorothy, his irrepressible wife, arrived. In his 
typical fashion, Blackmun had meticulously prepared: He was carrying a yarmulke 
and a Haggadah (the Passover narrative), that he had been studying. It was 
clear he was expecting a full-blown Seder -- complete with Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing we managed to skip was the hand-washing. We certainly all 
finished every last required cup of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Something magical happened at the Seder. Garrison Keillor has described 
Blackmun as "the shy person's justice," but that night he threw himself into 
the occasion -- asking questions about the various rituals, reading a portion 
of the service, drawing clerks from the other chambers into conversation and 
telling self-effacing stories about himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, several clerks remarked they now understood why Blackmun's clerks 
loved him so. It was a week night, and we had thought the Seder would be cut 
short as people went back to work, but no one wanted the evening to end. It was 
nearly midnight before we got up from the table. Though many of us could barely 
see straight, Blackmun was as alert and vivacious as he had been at eight that 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 My year with Blackmun was defined as much by the series of ordinary meals -- 
our daily breakfasts -- as it was by this one extraordinary dinner. For much of 
the time, we were accompanied to the cafeteria by a Supreme Court police 
officer, since Blackmun had received death threats from extremists who 
disagreed with his position on abortion. But the justice, nonetheless, stuck to 
his regular routine. Frequently, we would be joined by one of his former 
clerks, and invariably, Blackmun would be up-to-date about that clerk's 
personal and professional life. We would discuss history, baseball, politics 
and current court gossip. Then the justice would pull out a written list of 
work-related items to discuss and we would get ready for the coming day. 
</P>
<P>
 One view of the American judiciary holds that the law is what the judge had 
for breakfast. A year with Blackmun cured me of that sort of cynicism. But 
those breakfasts, and the Seder and special dinners he took us to, were a 
reflection of the kind of person he is: an uncommon combination of regular 
habits and genuine openness to new experiences and new people -- a careful man 
in both of the best senses of the word.

THAT PAROCHIAL EASTERN TILT OF CLINTON'S 'NATIONAL' COUNCIL ON THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Knight, Christopher Knight is an art critic for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Council on the Arts, the presidentially appointed body that 
oversees the National Endowment for the Arts, has long been composed of a 
majority of members who reside along the Eastern seaboard, from New England 
through New York to Washington. On Mar. 25, it was shifted even further in that 
parochial direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Before President Bill Clinton finally nominated eight prominent Americans to 
fill long-standing council vacancies -- nominations almost certain to be 
confirmed by the Senate -- 13 of the 25 available slots were held by citizens 
from the East. Now, it's 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the ratio is far more than the lack of geographic diversity 
in a government body that claims national standing. Other criteria are also 
legitimate. Areas with a higher density of exceptional artists and outstanding 
arts organizations should have greater representation than others. Drawing 
heavily on a seat of abundant merit for talented nominees makes sense, since 
the council shapes arts policy to foster excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 What riles is that the East, especially New York, is not the only area of the 
country that qualifies. The emphasis in Clinton's current council picks is 
obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about the pitiful level of arts representation from California -- 
specifically Los Angeles. By far the biggest, most diverse city in the most 
populous state in the union, Los Angeles wasn't just pivotal to Clinton's 
election. In the 1980s, its expansive arts scene joined the rarefied ranks of 
internationally significant artistic milieus -- the only U.S. city other than 
New York that can make that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 National Council membership does not yet reflect that stunning development. A 
single Angeleno sits on the panel. That's the same number as from Boise, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 The term of University of California, Los Angeles ethnomusicologist Robert 
Garfias actually expired in 1992. He's one of nine sitting members whose terms 
were extended, many of them when President George Bush was keeping a low 
profile during the political brush fire that engulfed the NEA late in his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other distinguished Californians also sit on the panel: Peter deCourcy 
Hero, a foundation administrator from San Jose, and Catherine Yi-Yu Cho Woo, 
director of the China Studies Institute at San Diego University. This November, 
the terms of Garfias, Hero and Woo end. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Clinton's nominees are from New York City; one each hails from 
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Washington. Sole exception to 
the Right Coast tilt is Colleen Jennings-Roggensack, president of the Assn. of 
Performing Arts Presenters and head of public events at Arizona State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyebrows rise skyward when you realize that, once confirmed, a total of eight 
council members will hail from New York. That's one-third of a board that acts 
on behalf of the nation -- a percentage unchanged from the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, due to staggered terms, seven seats on the National Council will 
open up. The current gross imbalance of its membership could change 
dramatically by the end of the year -- for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 A significant number of California artists, patrons, historians or 
administrators must be nominated. In fact, several from Los Angeles should get 
the nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Culturally, Los Angeles is worlds apart from the traditions of older, more 
European-oriented American cities. The model for a suburban rather than urban 
social matrix; the crossroads for Asia, Latin America and the United States; 
the global capital of pop-culture -- any number of defining distinctions are 
obvious. Los Angeles' artistic coming of age in the 1980s has made its cultural 
life a widely recognized touchstone for America today -- one that the National 
Council on the Arts ought to reflect and benefit from. 
</P>
<P>
 NEA Chair Jane Alexander, a prominent actress and the first working artist to 
head the agency, has strong ties to the L.A. community. Still, the chairman 
reports to the council, and the council's composition says something about 
federal understanding of the state of the arts today, and of their critical 
relationship to the diversity of American life. 
</P>
<P>
 The current nominations, regardless of the qualifications of individual 
nominees, say that only New York and its equally Old World vicinity matter -- 
as if important Eastern artists and arts institutions are singular 
standard-bearers that should be followed with conformity by a homogenized 
American culture. The nominees look less appropriate for a 1994 National 
Council on the Arts than for a 13 Original Colonies Plus-a-Few Council on the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton can be expected to have put his defining stamp on the National Council 
by the end of the year, since by then he will have named 15 of its 25 members. 
Here's one certainty: Because terms are staggered, at least six will reside in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A worst-case scenario, which is unlikely, is that none will be from Los 
Angeles. The next worse, entirely possible, is that Los Angeles will again 
claim only token representation. If so, the serious artistic life of the nation 
will be the poorer for it.

CHINA PLAYS ITS CHINA CARD: N. KOREA OR HUMAN RIGHTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James A. Baker III, James A. Baker III was the 61st secretary of state and 
the 67th Treasury secretary.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barring resolution of the crisis over North Korea's nuclear program, the 
Clinton Administration will have no choice but to recommend that Congress 
extend Most-Favored-Nation trading status to China when it expires in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: Beijing's cooperation is critical if the United States 
and its allies are to thwart North Korea's effort to renege on its obligations 
under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and circumvent the internationally 
recognized standards and safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
While advancing human rights in China is important to U.S. principles, 
preventing a nuclear North Korea is essential to our vital interests. The 
crisis in Korea makes the case for MFN, already strong on economic grounds, 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to liberals in the U.S. Congress, the Chinese government has long been 
the object of "linkage" between human rights and trade. Now, because of the 
crisis in North Korea, China is in a position to turn the tables and practice 
linkage on an unwilling United States. This time the linkage will be between 
renewing MFN status and Chinese cooperation on North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-North Korean negotiations over the last few months may have worsened the 
situation. By giving the North Koreans the impression that we were prepared to 
accept less than full compliance with IAEA safeguards, we signaled weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the face of North Korean obstructionism, the Clinton Administration is 
shifting gears. The United States has dispatched improved Patriot air-defense 
missiles to South Korea, augmented its naval forces and called for the 
resumption of "Team Spirit," the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 All these measures are overdue. The North Koreans must understand that an 
attack on the South will mean war with America. The Administration's recent 
military steps should reinforce this message. It should consider going even 
further by informing Pyongyang that the United States will defend South Korea 
from attack with whatever it takes. We should bolster deterrence by letting the 
North know if it tries to turn Seoul into a "sea of fire" we would not rule out 
the use of that same U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent that prevented Stalinist 
aggression in Western Europe for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 A more assertive U.S. military posture can help deter North Korean aggression. 
But it cannot reverse Pyongyang's single-minded pursuit of the nuclear option 
-- an ambition that threatens peace on the Korean peninsula, stability in East 
Asia and the viability of efforts to control weapons of mass destruction. In 
Tehran, Tripoli and Baghdad, rogue regimes are watching to see how the West 
resolves its first nuclear-proliferation crisis of the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea may yet open its facilities fully to inspection by the IAEA. But, 
given Pyongyang's renegade record, the United States should not count on it. 
Any strategy to curb Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions must now plainly include 
international economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has apparently opted for such a strategy. Its plan, 
presumably, is to begin modestly with simple condemnation and then build 
Security Council resolutions toward sanctions if, as expected, Pyongyang still 
balks. Whatever the Administration's U.N. game-plan, one thing is certain: 
China will be critical to any effort.  
</P>
<P>
 First, China sits on the Security Council and can veto or, by threat of veto, 
dilute any Security Council sanctions. Second, China has a special relationship 
with North Korea.  
</P>
<P>
 With China's economic opening to the West, its relations with North Korea may 
not be as important as they once were. But the Sino-North Korean relationship 
remains essential to Pyongyang -- one of the world's most isolated regimes.  
</P>
<P>
 China is North Korea's largest economic partner, with total trade estimated at 
close to $900 million in 1993. China accounts for three-fourths of the energy 
and food imported by the North -- commodities that keep the North's economy, 
already faltering, from collapsing altogether. Active Chinese participation in 
economic sanctions against North Korea is a sine qua non for their success.  
</P>
<P>
 China has no national stake in promoting a nuclear North Korea. The prospect 
of a new nuclear power in East Asia is alarming to Beijing -- a fact that 
Chinese leaders revealed to me when I visited there as secretary of state in 
1991. And Chinese cooperation was instrumental in U.S. efforts to compel North 
Korea to agree to IAEA safeguards -- a step Pyongyang took in January, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Administration would be wise to avoid presuming that U.S. and 
Chinese views on North Korea are identical. Whatever Beijing's views on North 
Korea, China's leaders will seek to leverage cooperation on North Korea into 
U.S. concessions or quiescence on human rights. The Administration is publicly 
sanguine about the prospects for Chinese cooperation on North Korea. But it is 
hard to imagine cooperation on sanctions surviving a congressional decision to 
revoke China's MFN status. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration was never comfortable linking MFN status for China 
with human rights. We believed that too strict a linkage would not only 
undermine U.S. commercial interests in one of the world's largest and fastest 
growing markets but also, perversely, set back the cause of free-market reforms 
in China. Economic reform, we believed, would, in the long-run, lead to 
political liberalization, the surest way to ensure human rights for all 
Chinese. U.S. policy was to avoid both outright isolation and a zealous embrace 
of China's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 That position was the object of much scorn by congressional Democrats and by a 
number of candidates -- including Bill Clinton -- during the 1992 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high-decibel campaign rhetoric, the Administration has sent 
unclear signals since assuming office. Last summer, the Administration 
supported renewal of MFN status for China despite evidence of continuing 
human-rights abuses. Officials at Treasury and Commerce recently urged that 
human rights be down-played for the sake of U.S. commercial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Administration faces a stark reality: Washington needs China on 
North Korea -- and Beijing knows it. MFN renewal will almost certainly 
represent part of the price of securing China's help in sanctions against 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 This is unlikely to take the form of something so crude as a formal quid pro 
quo. Indeed, if Chinese leaders are wise, they will offer superficial 
concessions -- release of a dissident or two, the lifting of an odious if 
unimportant restriction -- before Administration officials are forced to go to 
the Hill to face the human-rights hawks in their own party. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not be a pleasant experience. The Administration will find 
conservatives pointing out how close its China policy has come to that pursued 
by the Bush Administration. Liberals will likely cite the Clinton 
Administration's own rhetoric as evidence of hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 But, however galling the Administration will find arguing the case of MFN 
renewal, it will have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic arguments for renewal remain powerful: thousands of U.S. jobs are 
at risk. There is no evidence that denying MFN will do anything but inflict 
immense harm to the Chinese economy and economic reformers in China and cause 
Beijing to dig its heels in further against democratization. And, though 
China's human-rights policies violate deeply-held American principles, a 
nuclear North Korea is an immediate threat to U.S. and Western vital interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing's cooperation on sanctions against North Korea is a Chinese trump card 
-- one China will almost certainly play. The Clinton Administration, facing one 
of those unpleasant choices between reality and rhetoric, will be forced to 
follow suit by renewing MFN.

TARIK AZIZ; IRAQ'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER STRUGGLES AGAINST THE U.N. EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD B. STRAUS, Richard B. Straus is editor of Middle East Policy Survey. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a nation deeply suspicious of the outside world, Iraq has produced a 
remarkable crop of diplomats. Controlled by a dictator, Saddam Hussein, who has 
spent only five days outside Iraq, and run from a capital, Baghdad, that has 
been described as an Arab East Berlin (before reunification), over the years 
the Iraqi Foreign Service has still managed to assemble a corps of diplomats 
often acknowledged to be among the best outside Europe and the Americas. In a 
further anomaly, it was a Christian, Tarik Aziz, who in 1983, became this 
overwhelmingly Moslem country's chief foreign-policy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 First as foreign minister, and now, as deputy prime minister, the courtly, 
57-year-old Aziz runs Iraq's day-to-day diplomacy. Last month, he was in New 
York for meetings at the United Nations. And for the first time since the end 
of the Gulf War, he is able to report progress in his efforts to free Iraq from 
the ring of economic and political sanctions that the United States has managed 
to maintain. Clearly relishing the prospect that Iraq may soon be able to 
export millions of barrels of oil, Aziz was only too pleased to describe the 
ways and means of his successful diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen times previously, the U.N. Security Council had met and ruled -- 
without dissent -- that Iraq had not complied with a post-war resolution 
requiring that all its weapons of mass destruction be dismantled. These include 
chemical and biological weapons and, of course, its nuclear-weapons program. 
Without such a finding, and an agreement allowing a permanent outside 
monitoring system, Iraq would continue under a world-wide embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, the Iraqis were anything but cooperative. They repeatedly 
challenged U.N. teams sent to inspect military sites and blustered about 
violations of their sovereignty. But during a visit by a senior U.N. official 
last summer, Aziz extracted a pledge that if Iraq were to cooperate, the United 
Nations would allow Baghdad to resume unrestricted sale of its crude oil. With 
oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia, a return of Iraqi oil exports will 
mean a shift for commercial markets, not to mention Middle East politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview took place in an elegant townhouse on Manhattan's upper East 
Side, the official residence of the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, 
Nizar Hamdoon. Burly security guards patrol the hallways. Hussein's ubiquitous 
visage stares down in nearly every room. However, there was a slightly jarring 
detail in the reception room where the conversation took place. On a small 
table where Aziz placed his cigar and pipe and Hamdoon his cigarettes -- both 
are big smokers -- was a silver-framed picture of Hamdoon, then ambassador in 
Washington, with a smiling President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Do you believe the Security Council members see a shift in your 
behavior?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We have been cooperating with the council. We have been implementing 
U.N. resolutions -- but this has not been acknowledged in the past. Under the 
pressure of the Americans, all the achievements of Iraq were obscured, were 
denied. But that has come to an end. That biased attitude has come to an end. 
Now more and more delegations in the Security Council are listening to us . . . 
. The only obstinate position is the position of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And Britain.  
</P>
<P>
 A: And, of course, Britain is supporting the United States. Though Britain is 
showing a . . . limited understanding of the position of Iraq -- they listen to 
us at least. I met with the British ambassador and we had a session with the 
British delegation in which we explained what we have achieved. So this is a 
bit positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about France? Key U.S. officials single out France, and go so far as 
to say there has been coordination between France and Iraq on a common approach 
to get the United Nations to lift the embargo.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, technically speaking, there has been no coordination . . . . But we 
have explained our position to the French . . . and they showed understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In Washington, the French are singled out in part because two of their oil 
companies are thought to be in a position to benefit from Iraq's return to the 
oil market.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, the French do have interests in Iraq . . . . It's not strange that a 
country like France would look at its legitimate interests with Iraq. We used 
to do clean business with them and we intend to resume a clean business. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You must be aware of the talk in the oil industry of deals you are on the 
verge of signing with the French.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, yes, this is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In your letter to the Security Council president, you only make an oblique 
reference to an issue even the French emphasize -- the need for Iraq to 
recognize Kuwait's border. How do you plan to address this issue?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I understand the French position and the position expressed by other 
members . . . . (But) we said now the main issue for Iraq is to see that its 
rights and its sovereignty are respected. 
</P>
<P>
 When the sovereignty of Iraq and the legitimate rights of Iraq . . . are 
respected by the council, then Iraq will abide by the rules of international 
law . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, if I understand you clearly, the embargo against Iraq would have to be 
lifted before you will address the question of the border between Iraq and 
Kuwait.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, we are not putting it in the sense of before and after, because there 
is a biased treatment by a number of members of the council -- mainly the 
United States, first and foremost. This treatment is, first of all, infringing 
on the sovereignty of Iraq by the implementation of no-fly zones in the north, 
no-fly zones in the south, the interference in our internal affairs -- as it 
has been officially acknowledged by (National Security Adviser) Tony Lake in 
his article in "Foreign Affairs" -- without justification, against the letter 
and spirit of U.N. resolutions, is blocking the lifting of the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 So in such circumstances, Iraq would like to see that its rights are respected 
. . . . When that is the case, of course, Iraq would feel that it's not being 
threatened, Iraq would feel that it's not being hurt. In such a climate Iraq 
would be ready to consider solving all of the remaining problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One problem the British and Americans have is Iraq's seeming inability to 
accept the permanence of Kuwait. For example, the Iraqi media continue to refer 
to Kuwait as Iraq's 19th province.  
</P>
<P>
 A: The media does not always represent the official position of the government 
of Iraq. The media is the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But it's hard to believe --  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm the spokesman of the Iraqi government. I have said that this chapter is 
closed. This is the position of the government of Iraq. No official spokesman 
on the side of Iraq contradicted what I said. About the media, . . . this talk 
has stopped. If you will follow and observe what's being said in the Iraqi 
media, you wouldn't find these things. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Now that you've made some gains at the U.N., what is the next part of your 
strategy, particularly toward the United States?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We would like to have normal relations with the United States of America. 
We have said that we would not want to be enemies of the United States . . . . 
But we think the United States has to reconsider its position because it's 
wrong, it's illegal and its becoming a minority position in the Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As a practical matter, can you imagine the U.S. government, just three 
years after the end of the war when the same leadership is still in place in 
Baghdad, changing its policy toward Iraq and allowing you to sell massive 
amounts of oil?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, that's up to the Administration to decide. This is the right of Iraq 
according to resolutions that were written by the United States itself. The 
United States wrote those resolutions and we have implemented those 
resolutions, so (if) they change their positions they will find themselves in 
an awkward situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: OK, but I don't understand how that gets you to your goal of selling oil.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that if the United States continues its position in blocking the 
process in the Security Council, the very rationale, the raison d'etre of the 
resolutions would be damaged. And they will lose their credibility. And when a 
resolution loses its credibility because of the behavior of a single member, 
then the result will be that international public opinion will change its 
attitude toward Iraq. This will be similar to the unilateral position of the 
United States vis-a-vis Cuba. The United States is imposing an embargo on Cuba 
but the world is not imposing an embargo on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, now Iraq is under embargo because there is a U.N. resolution. Even 
the Philippines is implementing it. Argentina is implementing it. Venezuela, 
Norway. But when Iraq implements its obligations according to the U.N. 
resolution, then why should the international community boycott Iraq? It will 
be just an American position, and if I were in the place of the American 
Administration I wouldn't love to find myself isolated and in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Considering your experience in dealing with the previous Administration, 
especially in the negotiations before the war, how do you rate the performance 
of this Administration's --  
</P>
<P>
 A: Amateurs! 
</P>
<P>
 Q: -- who are running day-to day policy.  
</P>
<P>
 A: They have this foolish policy of dual containment. That's just a theory put 
on paper -- but in practice who is being contained? First of all, Iran is not 
contained by any means. Iran can buy whatever it wants from all over the world. 
It has money. It has borders. It has ports. There is no containment on Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 And even Iraq is not contained in the sense Tony Lake mentioned in his 
article. A nation is not a bunch of chickens to put in a cage and contain it 
and feed it, give it the small amounts of food you would like to give it. This 
is very arrogant and shallow kind of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a point when you will no longer take the diplomatic approach you 
are taking now? Is there a time limit?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are told, "You have to comply with this resolution." We comply. Then, in 
spite of the compliance, one powerful member says, "No, I'm not going to do my 
share." So then why should we comply with (other) resolutions? Then Iraq will 
act according to what the situation is. They have to know that, you see. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have any doubt that the United States will do all it can to isolate 
Iraq as long as the present regime is in power?  
</P>
<P>
 A: But Iraq is not isolated. The isolation is breaking gradually. Now we are 
reviving our contact with many countries who were boycotting us in the past . . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The other countries are not acting according to this obsession. Iraq is Iraq, 
you know, whoever leads Iraq that's up to the Iraqi people . . . . I don't know 
what's behind this obsession in the position of the United States. They have 
been just wasting their time and efforts and money trying to achieve what they 
cannot achieve. The Iraqi people are not going to change their government 
because some people in the White House or the State Department don't like their 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the government feel any pressure because of the economic situation ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, the pressure will not be in the direction to give concessions at the 
expense of sovereignty. No, no the people of Iraq will not accept to give up 
their sovereignty. Somalia didn't accept to give up its sovereignty, and Iraq 
is much better than Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you now believe that in six months or so Iraqi oil will be back on the 
international market?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Iraq cannot be excluded forever from that market. It's up to the other 
parties to accommodate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you think other countries, like Saudi Arabia, feel about the return 
of Iraq ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They will have to accommodate themselves to reality. Iraq will be back. 
Sooner or later, Iraq will be back.

'WALL' TEST FOR POLICE APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to LAPD's 'Wall' May Topple as Part of Entrance Exam," April 1: 
</P>
<P>
 As president of the Los Angeles Women Police Officers' Assn., I am not in 
favor of removing "the wall" from the physical agility test. The ability to get 
over a wall is a job-related requirement. The reason for this requirement is 
because suspects routinely flee from the police, running through back yards and 
over walls to escape. Can you imagine? Two officers pursue a suspect. One 
officer goes over the wall or fence alone, and the other officer remains 
behind, looking for a stepladder. What's next? 
</P>
<P>
 This requirement is a valid part of the screening process for all Los Angeles 
police officers. Any potential candidate capable of passing the other entrance 
requirements can learn to scale a six-foot wall. The department provides 
preparation for the entire testing process. These preparation courses have been 
open to all candidates for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Climbing over the wall is not a matter of strength, but of agility and 
technique. Some woman may need to use a different method than men because of 
differences in upper body strength. The methods are all valid and are taught to 
candidates before the test is given. The department doesn't need to reduce the 
hiring standards to allow more women to succeed. However, test preparation may 
require some individual initiative and planning. 
</P>

 * In 1977, I went "over the wall." I was bruised like never before, and it 
took me about 30 tries, but the sense of accomplishment has never been 
duplicated. As a LAPD reserve officer specialist, this was not part of my 
required training. But I think it's part of being a cop. Now the feminists want 
me to be a damn sissy.

<P>
 * The average block wall between houses is six-feet tall, so if a criminal is 
being chased by a female officer he has a good chance of escaping just by 
jumping over a wall. We now have female firefighters who can't push a ladder up 
to a burning building, so what's next, blind detectives? What's wrong with 
hiring the people most qualified for the job? It's my life, not someone's ego. 
</P>
<P>
 HAYDEN D. HAMILTON

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I read with great interest former LAPD Assistant Chief David Dotson's column 
("Why Purging the LAPD of Bias Won't Be Easy," Opinion, April 3). 
</P>
<P>
 While I appreciate Dotson giving me credit for being the innovator of 
Neighborhood Watch while I was LAPD's chief, I was shocked to read his 
revisionist history statements that I stopped hiring police officers when the 
city agreed to hire women as full-duty officers. 
</P>
<P>
 While chief, I abolished the rank of "policeman" and "policewoman" and 
replaced them with the generic rank of "police officer." The accusation that I 
stopped hiring police officers because I did not want to hire female officers 
is absurd and insulting. As everyone knows, it is the City Council that 
authorizes the number of people the Police Department can hire, and it is the 
City Personnel Department that determines who is hired. 
</P>
<P>
 While the article is very moving, maybe Dotson ought to readopt the old LAPD 
motto, "Just the facts."

POST OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his March 24 letter, Gary A. Robb gets up in arms over the prospect of a 
government-administered health care program. He offers the post office as the 
kind of management he fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, what he should fear is the reverse: having the health care guys 
running the post office. Between 1967 and 1990, hospital care costs rose 1,200% 
while the cost of a first-class stamp went up only 417% (6 cents to 25 cents) 
-- about equal to the consumer price index.

<P>
 Once again, a government agency can't balance its budget, so it's raising 
prices. This time, not surprisingly, it's the post office. One can easily see 
why this monolith is losing money: The competition provides better service. The 
post office simply can't deliver as fast as the phone, a fax, or Federal 
Express. And raising the price of stamps is just going to drive away more 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, why not cut back on delivery? Most households and even businesses do 
not need mail delivered six days a week. Those that do can pay extra for it. Or 
how about charging more rather than less for junk mail? The post office, 
particularly in urban areas where there are several forms of "information 
delivery," will simply price itself out of existence unless it does some 
streamlining.

 * Re "Abramson to Defend Erik Menendez," April 6: 
</P>
<P>
 As a citizen of Ventura County, I am outraged that the taxpayers of Los 
Angeles County will be footing the bill for Leslie Abramson's legal fees for 
confessed murderer Eric Menendez. And what a bill it will be at $125,000 per 
year! The court-appointed counsel for brother Lyle indicates that the defense 
will not be ready for trial until later this year. Ms. Abramson will probably 
collect in 1995 if the past is any indication of the length of the trial for 
"the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 People will go to bed hungry tonight but an attorney who has already been paid 
$650,000 need not worry about her next meal. The judge should be ashamed of 
himself.

 * The accounting of how the Menendez brothers' vast fortune has been depleted 
("Little Remains of Menendez Estate, Records Show," April 3) was very 
interesting, but it somehow failed to arouse any compassion in me for these 
poor, murdering kids or for their pitiable attorneys who have so far earned 
only $1.5 million.

 Leslie Abramson, the defense lawyer for Erik Menendez, in her solicitation of 
$1 million for legal fees for the retrial, once again brings home the sad fact 
that in the present "justice" system, a "not guilty" verdict and the 
availability of money are closely related.

GIVING ELOQUENT VOICE TO ONE IN EIGHT; A SEARING EXHIBITION AT SANTA MONICA 
COLLEGE ON THE ISSUE OF BREAST CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "One in Eight: Women and Breast Cancer," now on display at the Santa Monica 
College Art Gallery, is the work of 12 artists who have had breast cancer. It 
is not an easy exhibit to view. But then, breast cancer is not an easy disease 
to explain or, in many instances, to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing incidence of breast cancer -- a disease that according to an 
upward-revised estimate will afflict one in eight American women -- has brought 
forth much anger and debate about the funding for research if not consensus 
about the disease's causation or a cure. "One in Eight" mirrors for breast 
cancer the despairing, wry creativity that has marked the suffering and death 
caused by AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 Anger is an easy emotion to stoke amid the growing ranks of breast cancer 
survivors. Consider just the recent charges of scientific fraud in large-scale 
research studies and the continuing -- and confusing -- debate among physicians 
about the advisability of regular mammograms for younger women and the efficacy 
of the less-radical surgical treatment options. Add in the absence of clear 
progress toward a cure and the alarming number of new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the pieces in "One in Eight" reflect that deep, raw frustration; "Left 
Breast, No Nipple" displays the artist's breast prothesis atop a circular saw 
blade, mounted on black velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are victories in the war against breast cancer, survivors, 
even apparent cures. The "One in Eight" artists are certainly among them. In 
"Some Days You Feel So Alive" a woman dances against a magnificent sunset. But 
still the casualties mount. Forty-six thousand deaths from the disease are 
predicted this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Art gives voice to the despair. And sometimes art prompts hard questions about 
how we allocate increasingly scarce federal research dollars and how we might 
do better -- questions that can change policy. This year the National 
Institutes for Health is spending $10 billion on research, $204 million 
specifically on breast cancer. Is this enough? No. Proposed federal legislation 
would increase research spending substantially through a 1% surcharge on health 
insurance premiums. The plan could generate an additional $6 billion annually. 
More for breast cancer, more for AIDS, more for Parkinson's disease, and so on. 
The idea is well worth exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 "One in Eight" runs through April 23 (the exhibit is dark this Monday through 
Saturday, during the Santa Monica College spring break).

THE FINANCIAL MARKET'S SHADOWY NEW RISK; DERIVATIVE DEALING ATTRACTS 
WASHINGTON'S ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's financial markets are complicated enough these days, what with the 
lightning speed of computer trading. Now along comes a relatively new wrinkle 
called derivatives. These are special financial tools that only the biggest 
investors can use to hedge their bets and protect their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects the world of derivative dealing is a scary one. Even 
Washington is starting to pay close attention to the growing use of these 
arcane, highly sophisticated financial instruments. Although derivatives are 
little understood or used outside of Wall Street, some companies, banks, 
brokerages and even mutual funds seem to love them; the face value of 
derivatives in play today is an awesome $15 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from another 
asset, such as stocks, bonds or commodities. Their purpose is to diminish risk. 
They do this by offering all sorts of contracts -- swaps, options, forwards, 
caps or collars, to name a few -- that can be used to hedge against 
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and stock and commodity 
prices. Small investors can't use derivatives -- only huge institutions like 
large banks, high-flying brokerage houses, mutual funds.  
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that unregulated derivatives could, in extreme cases, pose a 
systemic risk to world financial markets is prompting Congress to consider 
safeguards, especially oversight and disclosure. In introducing a bill in 
January to create a Federal Derivatives Commission, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) 
described them as "the new wild card in international finance." Last Wednesday 
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) called on the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to study the link, if any, between derivatives and the current 
volatility in the stock and bond markets. The House Banking Committee will hold 
a hearing on derivatives Wednesday. Used intelligently and with care, 
derivatives provide immense benefits by creating a vast pool of financial 
resources worldwide. Through computers, they allow money to grow in new ways. 
In some practical applications, derivatives -- which amount to speculative side 
bets -- enable businesses to improve their ability to secure financing and 
various other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they also pose huge risks that disclosures and better accountability 
might help to at least mitigate. Few if any of the companies, banks, 
brokerages, insurance companies, mutual and pension funds and other 
institutions that deal in derivatives break out these transactions on income 
statements or balance sheets. It is this woeful lack of accounting that is 
worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivative dealing must be moved into the light. After all, consider the 
downside: the huge risks involved when interest rates shift sharply or 
international events intervene to trigger derivative defaults that then might 
panic financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, thankfully, derivatives' losses have been contained and isolated. The 
giant German company Metallgesellschaft lost $1.3 billion last year on a bet on 
oil futures. Financier George Soros lost $600 million in February in mistakenly 
projecting a rise in the U.S. dollar against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought that a series of such derivative losses might have a devastating 
domino effect is a chilling one. Common sense calls for disclosure, 
accountability and maybe some sensible if limited regulation.

NAVAL ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Navy Panel Seeks to Expel 29 in Cheating Scandal," April 1: 
</P>
<P>
 The most enduring lesson I learned at the Naval Academy was given during the 
first few days of "plebe summer." During the Spanish-American War, a young 
soldier was instructed to deliver an important message to Garcia, an American 
officer, but the messenger was given no details as to Garcia's whereabouts, 
only an urgent message which could influence the result of the war.He delivered 
the message. No one knows how he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 That was to be our model for behavior at Annapolis -- get things done as 
directed, the method will not be investigated. Yes, we learned about the Honor 
Code, "A midshipman does not lie, cheat, or steal" but more often we were 
directed to "take a message to Garcia." The academy is not the only place in 
this country where there is a conflict between the competing virtues of 
efficiency and honor. But it is an extremely visible place where we all believe 
honor should be upheld. Perhaps the lessons of these midshipmen, as well as the 
questionable, yet efficient, actions of prominent alumni Oliver North and Ross 
Perot, might lead us all to re-evaluate the importance of a "sense of honor." 
Perhaps we should ask for some more details about Garcia's messenger.

L.A. HOTEL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Mike Davis' column ("Trying to Build a Union Movement in Los Angeles," 
Opinion, March 20) is a gross misrepresentation of the hotel industry and 
should offend all of the Los Angeles hospitality workers in general. 
</P>
<P>
 The author suggests the entire hotel industry mistreats and exploits its 
employees. He is clearly wrong about the cleaning standards quoted in his 
article. As in all industries, there are unfortunate abuses of employees, 
including white-collar. However, Davis' liberal misuse and distortion of the 
hospitality industry are upsetting for those of us who genuinely care of our 
employees and work hard to keep them fully (and fairly) employed. Davis 
conveniently omits from his shoddy article the value of the benefits of meals, 
tips, lodging discounts and health-medical coverage typically provided to our 
employees, both non-union and union. The author unfairly suggests that our 
industry openly promotes sweatshop conditions. How many hotels has Davis ever 
worked in? How many hotels did David research for his article? How many 
employees is Davis responsible for? 
</P>
<P>
 The author's suggestion that Local 11 efforts are economically justified only 
reflects Davis' lack of the facts surrounding the Los Angeles lodging industry 
and poorly reflects on his credibility. There are always exceptions and 
exploitation of employees is unacceptable for any industry. However, to 
actively disrupt our fragile tourist/convention industry will clearly backfire: 
Unions are not held in esteem around the country; they have consistently failed 
for the employee and benefited only the union officials. The only 
accomplishment from Local 11's advertised activities will be to further reflect 
the silly attitude of the union. And, once again, it is the union employee who 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
 I would strongly advise Davis to get facts and properly research for future 
articles regarding the hotel industry. Tourism is way too important (and 
sophisticated) to Los Angeles to be sidetracked by amateur journalists such as 
Davis.

COMMENTARY; VICTIM OF AN ETHICAL GENERATION GAP; JAPAN: HOSOKAWA CAME UP THE 
RANKS BY DOING FAVORS, A TRADITION THE OUTRAGED VOTERS NO LONGER ACCEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN C. CLEMONS, Steven C. Clemons is executive director of the Japan 
Policy Research Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few thought that Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would keep his job 
for long. Hosokawa, Japan's first head of state in 38 years not a standard 
bearer of the long-reigning Liberal Democratic Party, had obvious problems 
leading a coalition of seven divergent political parties. Some thought that 
fierce battling over political and electoral reforms would bring him down; 
others thought that recent feuds between two coalition giants, Ichiro Ozawa and 
Masayoshi Takemura, would end his tenure. But these he survived. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Hosokawa has completely changed Japan's election system, led 
modest but important reforms in campaign finance laws and just announced that 
his Nihon Shinto Party would merge with the Clean Government Party (Komeito) 
and with Ozawa's Shinseito Party. Boosting him further, Hosokawa has been 
sporting the highest public approval ratings of any prime minister in recent 
years. Things could not have been much better for this media-savvy leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hosokawa, often referred to as "Mr. Clean," may not be so clean after all. 
Like every other top-ranked politician in Japan, Hosokawa has been climbing the 
political ladder by exchanging favors for votes and money; by providing 
government goods or government access to constituents in exchange for their 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The political machines crafted by former Louisiana Gov. Huey Long and Chicago 
Mayor Richard Daley are not dissimilar from the powerful and enriching machines 
that former Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka built. Although Tanaka's 
prime ministerial career ended in 1974 amid allegations of money politics that 
later erupted into the Lockheed bribery scandal, his machine went on to support 
former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned over his role in the 
Recruit scandal, and LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who resigned his Diet post when 
it was discovered that $50 million in gold bars and cash bearer bonds lay 
stashed in his home closet. Ozawa, the behind-the-scenes political orchestrator 
who brought Hosokawa to power, is the latest beneficiary of the Tanaka machine. 
Huey Long and Kakuei Tanaka may have been superstars of political 
back-scratching, but Hosokawa is reflective of something different. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Lockheed and Recruit cases registered at extraordinarily high 
levels on the Richter scale for scandals in Japan, the attention focused on the 
firms and individuals involved has directed attention away from the real issue: 
all local, prefectural and national level politicians in Japan, if they wished 
to keep their jobs, have pursued votes and money in exchange for government 
favors. Maybe a local contractor gets the permit to build a new train station, 
or a small delivery company receives a tough to get permit to expand its 
territory, or any of a million favors are doled out to campaign donors by 
politicians. Hosokawa does not differ from thousands of elected leaders in 
Japan who have built their state through a process of mutual collusion between 
politicians, bureaucrats and favor-seeking firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's problem is that although he grew up in the same political 
fraternity as most of those in Japan's Diet, the Japanese people are demanding 
the kind of transparency into personal and financial affairs that was 
unthinkable until recent years. The Japanese public was outraged when it 
learned that securities houses were guaranteeing big companies like Hitachi and 
Nissan against losses while housewives took real risks in the stock market. 
They have been further shocked by revelations that Japan's gangsters, yakuza, 
have bankrolled politicians, compromised major financial institutions and are 
well-taken care of by the government. Kanemaru's gold bars and Hawaii condos as 
well as the continuing spate of revelations about outright bribes of public 
officials by construction firms have finally pushed the public beyond their 
tolerance of "behind the shoji screen corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa has refused to allow his personal finances to be opened to the 
public, although other LDP leaders in recent years have done so. Hosokawa, 
riding into office on the wave of political-reform hysteria in Japan, has 
tragically fallen on his own sword. In contrast to the clean image he promised, 
Hosokawa reflects the general and broad corruption of Japan's political system, 
not a corruption that has recently developed but the kind of publicly accepted 
and known corruption that has characterized Japanese politics in the entire 
postwar period. Hosokawa claims that a $1-million loan that he received from 
the Sagawa Kyubin firm was repaid. If so, then he is one of the only 
politicians who has repaid such a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue for Japan is that none of its current leaders matured in a clean 
political system. They are powerful because they built the best political 
machines, raised the most money and secured the greatest amount of government 
resources to return to their constituents. No politician has been exempt from 
this reality. Hosokawa's departure means one of two things: either the Japanese 
public is going to have to forgive the past misdeeds of their current leaders 
or the revolving door of the prime minister's office is going to be swinging 
for some time.

PERSPECTIVE ON PRIVATIZATION; OUTSIDERS WON'T PUT L.A. FIRST; THE CITY IS 
ALREADY COST-EFFICIENT IN THE AREAS IT WOULD CONTRACT OUT, WHILE PROVIDING JOBS 
FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK RIDLEY-THOMAS, Mark Ridley-Thomas is the Los Angeles City Council 
member for the 8th District, located in the South-Central area west of the 
Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 26 years ago this month that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in 
Memphis, Tenn., fighting for the rights of public employees. Today the fight 
continues. In January, an overflow assembly of 1,000 Angelenos packed a local 
church on the 65th birthday of Dr. King to rally against the privatization of 
city services. As we sang songs of unity and responded to speeches, the rafters 
shook and buzzed from the cheering and clapping. 
</P>
<P>
 These citizens were rallying against proposals in City Hall to launch pilot 
privatization programs for services such as trash collection, golf course 
operations, parking enforcement and building maintenance. These plans advocate 
replacing public employees with independent private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 I joined the rally, along with seven other members of the City Council, to 
help mobilize the public against privatization, simply because such a policy is 
not in the best interests of this city. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the mayor's office and the city's Department of Recreation and 
Parks met with a private company interested in operating the city's 11 golf 
courses. Other departments have been instructed to develop proposals to seek 
out private contractors. Whether these proposals will be included in Mayor 
Riordan's budget to the City Council is yet to be seen. However, privatization 
was a cornerstone of his campaign and he continues to explore ways to deliver 
on that pledge; for example, contracting non-emergency ambulance services with 
the L.A. Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost, quality and justice are all good reasons to reject privatization: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost. Other cities that have experimented with privatization have had mixed 
and inconclusive results -- even though many of them, unlike Los Angeles, were 
saddled with horribly inefficient union rules in the services to be privatized 
-- for example, many performed trash collection manually with two employees on 
each truck. But 95% of L.A. garbage trucks are already operated by single 
operators, so the biggest possible efficiency step has already been taken in 
this service area. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cities, taxpayers were hit with higher service fees by privatizers, 
offsetting lower direct costs to government. It is possible that contractors 
can provide a service for less money by offering employees lower wages and less 
benefits. They could also perhaps save on equipment costs. But the long-term 
result may be a work force as disgruntled as its equipment is unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quality. I have received more than 100 letters from constituents on the 
privatization issue. They have commented on the quality of the city's parking 
enforcement, golf-course operations, trash collection and other services. The 
majority of such letters oppose privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality is high because of worker attitude and the design of these public 
programs. An attitude that public service has meaning is part of the ethic of 
public employment, and it reveals itself in positive customer service. This may 
suffer when public accountability and control are reduced and pressure is 
increased to cut corners in the name of profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Justice. Hard-working people doing a good job should expect to continue 
doing that job. This is only fair. Also at issue are economic equity and social 
justice for women and minorities, since many are employed in services targeted 
for privatization. For example, about 85% of the city's refuse collectors are 
minorities. City parking enforcement employees are 85% minority and almost 50% 
female, even though the total city work force is only 25% female. 
</P>
<P>
 The population of women and minorities in these service areas is high in part 
because of discriminatory practices elsewhere. Public employment has been a 
haven for people of color who were systematically excluded from private 
employment or more "glamorous" professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Government, as the insurer of justice in our society, has an obligation to 
maintain this commitment within its own work force. Government employment is 
important in terms of the security, decent pay, benefits and the respectability 
it provides. The victims of past discrimination who have found a way to 
overcome the odds through meaningful employment should not now become victims 
of an insensitive policy with questionable merits. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, government has an obligation to identify areas of inefficiency. But 
the assumption that the private sector is, by definition, more efficient, more 
fair and delivers a better product is simply unsubstantiated. On the other 
hand, most of the targeted departments have been successful at efficiency, 
successful in quality of service and successful in employing people who 
struggle for social equity and economic justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The current state of affairs simply does not warrant efforts to privatize. 
Government has an obligation to foster equity, quality and efficiency, which 
are not inherently incompatible. Privatization is not in the best interests of 
the city.

 Yet top Republicans in the Senate are promising to filibuster to death a bill 
that would end this absurdity.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure, titled the Workplace Fairness Act, easily passed the House. A 
Senate majority supports it, including some Republicans. But even the GOP 
filibuster, which may well kill it, isn't enough for the union-haters. They 
want serious money from the public to wage more furious fights against labor. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise funds for the "Right to Work" Committee and its goal of a "union 
free" environment, Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.) says big money is needed quickly 
because if the measure passes, all hell will break loose. Here's a sample of 
his ranting, in a national fund-raising appeal: 
</P>
<P>
 "America will be smitten by rampant inflation! Taxes will soar as union 
sympathizers in Congress go on a tax-raising spree! Unemployment will mount! 
Strike violence will wrack communities! Good jobs will be moved overseas and 
productivity will plummet!" 
</P>
<P>
 While his logic is skewed, all of Smith's apocalyptic predictions are standard 
fare for the reactionary "Right to Work" Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is the unions, weaker today then they have been in years, that should 
be raising money for a nationwide campaign to bolster the courage of those 
senators who want fairness for workers and should vote to break the filibuster 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of the problems caused for workers by this contradictory law -- firms 
can't fire strikers, but can "permanently replace" them -- are everywhere. A 
particularly egregious one is the strike by about 500 workers -- mostly older 
Latinas -- against Diamond Walnut Growers Inc. in Stockton. They were fired 
("permanently replaced," to use the firm's euphemism) nearly three years ago 
after taking pay cuts of up to 40% to help the growers over a bad economic 
patch. They struck when the firm wanted even more cuts despite the healthy 
recovery of the walnut market and of Diamond Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert Reich has just persuaded the firm to resume 
negotiations with the workers' union, Teamsters Local 601, but management 
insists it will not make room for those it fired because they struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Workplace Fairness Act escapes the filibuster blockade, its 
provisions would really only return us to the days before 1981 when 
then-President Ronald Reagan permanently replaced striking air-traffic 
controllers. Employers had rarely used the "permanent replacement" weapon, 
which stemmed from a 1938 Supreme Court case, until Reagan set the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 The Workplace Fairness Act would not in general bring fairness to labor laws. 
It does nothing about putting teeth in current laws that allow the National 
Labor Relations Board little power other than to scold law-violating employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Take one of the latest decisions by the NLRB in a typical case: The board 
ruled after a year of costly investigations and hearings that Pony Express, a 
trucking firm based in Charlotte, N.C., broke the law many times and illegally 
refused to "bargain in good faith" with the Teamsters union chosen by its 
workers to represent them.  
</P>
<P>
 The NLRB heard more than 120 charges against Pony Express, which has about 
5,000 workers nationwide, and found a wide array of broken laws ranging from 
threats of reprisals against any worker found joining or even supporting the 
union to warning that the company would never reach a union-contract agreement, 
no matter what the union proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what happens? The company can appeal to the courts, and ultimately, if it 
loses all of its many possible appeals, it could be firmly "ordered" to bargain 
in good faith. That could take months and even years, with still more appeals. 
That is not a winning scenario for any worker who wants a union. 
</P>
<P>
 The NLRB is a toothless tiger that can only growl loudly. While the board has 
a promising new chairman, former Stanford law professor William Gould IV, 
companies like Pony Express are unlikely to abandon the strategy that holds it 
is better to spend a few hundred-thousand dollars for union-busting lawyers 
than to let workers vote for a union and maybe get a few extra bucks in wages 
and fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate should pass the Worker Fairness Act, then enact substantial 
labor-law reforms to give workers a real chance to have a union, as the Wagner 
Act promised 57 years ago.

NURSING HOME NEWSLETTER SPAWNS A MEDIA STAR; PUBLISHING: DAVID GREENBERGER TOOK 
NOTES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH ELDERLY RESIDENTS IN BOSTON, WHICH EVOLVED INTO 
TRADING CARDS, CDS AND EVEN A PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HOLGUIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When David Greenberger began interviewing residents of a suburban Boston 
nursing home in the late 1970s for an in-house newsletter, he certainly wasn't 
thinking of a career in multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly residents at the all-male Duplex Nursing Home were delighted to 
provide fodder for the photocopied issues of the "Duplex Planet." They were 
quite willing to be quoted at length. But they had no interest in reading it. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberger's friends, however, couldn't get enough. Greenberger's questions 
to his elderly friends were bizarre and capricious: "Would you swim in coffee 
if it weren't too hot?" 
</P>
<P>
 The anecdotes and conversations he gleaned contained a strange mixture of 
wisdom and disconnectedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are an old man and you go into a bar in pajamas, people will buy you 
drinks," Duplex resident Francis McElroy once told Greenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Word about "Duplex Planet" got around. Eventually, he had 500 subscribers, 
including such luminaries as movie director Jonathan Demme and REM's singer 
Michael Stipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 14 years later, the nursing home is closed and most of Greenberger's 
original sources are dead or relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "Duplex Planet" has taken on a life of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Now available from the Duplex industry, for example: trading cards with quotes 
and illustrated portraits of some Duplex residents; CDs featuring musical 
adaptations of the text or Greenberger's spoken word recordings; a Duplex 
Planet Radio Hour monthly broadcast by Greenberger over a public radio station 
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more: Greenberger has written a play based on characters from the 
Duplex and he travels the country on reading tours, spreading the Duplex word 
from a lectern -- including a recent performance at Seattle's Center on 
Contemporary Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 His subjects may ramble, but Greenberger generally pares their remarks to 
pungent commentary or deeply personal tales, sometimes clouded with lapses in 
logic and other times told with crystal clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all sweethearts, some of us are fresh sweethearts and some of us are 
stale," quipped William Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snakes are some of the finest things in the world, but they're also one of 
the finest things to leave alone," said Henry Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberger said he's trying to abolish societal or cultural fears about aging 
and at the same time remind us that -- no matter what -- growing old is just 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this material speaks to everyone because this is something that 
happens to all of us," said Greenberger, now 39. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just never made sense to me the way in which people resist aging. I mean 
there's a certain natural fear of dying, but if you're going to resist 
something, you might as well resist something that's going to give a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Faber and Faber published Greenberger's book -- "Duplex Planet: 
Everybody's Asking Who I Was." It is a compilation of several editions of the 
fledgling magazine, with entire chapters based on questions like "Who is 
Frankenstein?" or "How close can you get to a penguin?" 
</P>
<P>
 It shares shelf space with "Duplex Planet Illustrated," a comic book series 
published by Seattle-based FantaGraphics Books that utilizes Greenberger's text 
and combines it with illustrations from some of the country's most avant-garde 
cartoonists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleasantly baffled over how something this strange is starting to gain 
widespread appeal," said cartoonist Daniel Clowes, who was the first to start 
illustrating excerpts from Greenberger's magazine on the back pages of his 
popular comic book "Eightball." 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely feel like it's starting to reach more people," said Greenberger. 
"The book is a major step in getting the word out. It's meant for people to 
take this in and have them reflect on a part of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 At his live readings, Greenberger becomes an actor of sorts. He affects a 
strange stage presence while reading from his interviews -- something like a 
philosophic lounge act. 
</P>
<P>
 When the audience chuckles over some of Greenberger's interviews, however, the 
whole thing begins to sound a little like Art Linkletter's campy TV show, "Kids 
Say the Darndest Things." Both deal with groups of people who are completely 
devoid of self-consciousness. Except Greenberger isn't quoting unabashed and 
naive children. The humor in his text sometimes stems from senility and 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenberger said his Duplex Planet products are not a case of 
exploitation, profiting from the condition of others under the guise of 
exploring the wry or even bizarre perspective of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, people who voice that concern fear the notion of growing old. It's 
like going up to them and screaming, 'Cancer,' " he said. "I don't edit out the 
people who don't make sense. Some of these people don't make sense all the 
time, but the only option is leaving them out and that wouldn't be a complete 
picture. If we pretend it's not funny it becomes condescending." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberger said he continues spending time in nursing homes, building 
relationships, asking questions and, of course, taking notes. If he can't erode 
a cultural fear completely, Greenberger said, at least he's made some friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm very lucky I've gotten to know these people," Greenberger said. "A 
lot of them are still my friends and I'm very thankful for that. People should 
never underestimate other people and their abilities simply because of their 
age."

GREAT STRIDES SEEN IN WORLD FIGHT ON POLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The global campaign against polio scored gains against the crippling disease 
in virtually all regions of the world in 1993, with less than half the number 
of cases than were registered in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Geneva-based World Health Organization said a large outbreak of 
poliomyelitis in Pakistan in 1993 ran counter to the "almost universal decline" 
in the disease.Pakistan recorded 1,803 cases, up from 1,046 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO is campaigning to eliminate the disease through a vaccination program by 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 141 countries registered zero new cases during 1993, a WHO statement 
said. For the year, 7,898 cases were registered in 46 countries. In 1992, the 
total was 15,911 in 58 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time a case of paralytic polio was registered in the Western 
Hemisphere was Aug. 25, 1991, in Peru, said Dr. Nicholas Ward, head of WHO's 
anti-polio program.

DON'T BET AGAINST THIS DETERMINED WOMAN, GAMBLER WITH MIDAS TOUCH; COLORADO: 
VIRGINIA LEWIS OVERCAME AN EARLY ABUSIVE MARRIAGE AND LITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION 
TO STRIKE IT RICH WITH CASINOS. SHE CALLS HER CAREER A COCKTAIL PARTY THAT 
SHE'S BEING PAID TO ATTEND. HER SUCCESS ALSO RESTS ON STRONG WORK ETHIC AND 
PASSION FOR PERFECTION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia Lewis is a gambler with the Midas touch. 
</P>
<P>
 She survived an abusive marriage, reared two children and, with little formal 
education, became a successful entrepreneur in the casino business, a 
particularly risky pursuit historically dominated by tough personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been afraid that I could do anything, through sheer persistence," 
said Lewis, 38. "I'll read whatever it takes. I'll listen to whoever is 
interested in giving me any information available. I'm just not afraid to try 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was the first in Colorado to open a casino, called the Gold Mine, when 
limited-stakes gambling became legal in three former mining meccas in October, 
1991. Although 38 casinos have failed, she prospered and acquired a second, 
called Jazz Alley. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with Lewis attribute her success to high priority on customer 
service, a deeply ingrained work ethic and a passion for perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "She uses very clear judgment and really says and does the right things," said 
Tom Lettero, a casino marketing vice president for the MGM Grand Hotel in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed with the level of communication she had with her 
customers when she got them into her building," he said. "Location has helped 
her, but she's very smart business-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent wintry day, Lewis sat in a dim bar inside Jazz Alley, watching 
patrons plunk quarters in slot machines as she reflected on her life, a mosaic 
spanning nearly two decades of 75-hour work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh child in a family of 13, Lewis was born while her mother was on a 
fishing trip near their hometown of Locust Grove, Okla. "All I know was 
Liberace was playing while she was giving birth," Lewis said. "They called up 
some doctor and he was half drunk. It was a real country birth." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis grew into a loner who loved to read as the family moved from town to 
town in Oklahoma, Nevada and California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, she fell in love and married, beginning a five-year journey 
that would prove to be the most difficult of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was rebellion," she said. "I wanted my mother to tell me no, and she 
didn't and I was shocked. And you know, at age 16, you're so stubborn you go 
ahead and go through with it." 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned from a weekend honeymoon, Lewis' husband lost his job, the 
first of many. Lewis dropped out of high school and worked at a Burger King in 
Henderson, Nev. Three months later she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Things went from bad to worse after their second child arrived. The more her 
husband failed, the harder Lewis worked. She got her high school equivalency 
diploma, started college and worked nights as a casino photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband became abusive and they separated, but he remained in their lives. 
"It was a nightmare," she said, recalling nights she slept on a couch near the 
front door to protect the children. "His heart was breaking that he was doing 
this to me, but he couldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I had to prove I was stronger than him. I think that's when he 
finally gave up, when he realized I wasn't going to back down." 
</P>
<P>
 The day their divorce was final, Lewis was 21 with two children to support, 
but said she wasn't worried. "I always felt like I was going to get somewhere. 
I didn't know where that somewhere would be, but I always felt like I was going 
to be successful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She tried a home-renovation business and a restaurant before she met and 
married Jim Lewis. They ran a successful bar in Palm Desert, Calif., before 
they got gambling fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first venture was a casino on the Flandreau Santee Sioux Indian 
reservation in eastern South Dakota. It opened successfully, but they sold out 
when a new tribal leadership sought to renegotiate their contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The family headed for Colorado's legalized gaming towns: Central City and 
Black Hawk, side by side in a narrow, winding canyon 40 miles west of Denver; 
and Cripple Creek, near Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 At a main intersection in Black Hawk, Lewis spied a 1950s-era nondescript 
service station. That was to be her gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked feverishly to get the new casino ready in six months, often 
catching a few hours' sleep on the office couch. The first year, the Gold Mine 
netted $4.6 million. It has remained profitable, but Lewis declined to reveal 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, she and her husband took over Jazz Alley, at the far end of a 
dirt-packed Main Street, which curdled into ankle-deep mud during rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 They sunk all their profits into Jazz Alley, but it lost tens of thousands of 
dollars a month for 13 months. Although her husband wanted to quit, Lewis 
refused. The casino made money for the first time in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Her long working hours took a toll on the marriage, which ended in divorce. 
Jim Lewis remains a business partner, but has moved to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis considers work her entertainment, describing the casino business as a 
cocktail party where "they were paying me to come." 
</P>
<P>
 She has little time for outside activities, beginning her workday around 7 
a.m. and continuing until nearly midnight. She watches little television, but 
regularly reads magazines, from Forbes to Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' other priorities are her children, Jennifer, 21, and Mike, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 She views the setbacks that life has dealt her as challenges to conquer with 
quiet resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, if I didn't have a dime today, I could start over. It wouldn't 
scare me a bit. I'll go clean houses and I'll clean them better than anyone 
else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have a normal fear of failure because, boy, that hurts, you know, when 
you're not successful. But I'm not afraid that I couldn't start over again."

SCOUT LEADER KILLED IN DOING GOOD DEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Boy Scout leader died while doing a good deed when a piece of sheet metal 
blowing in the wind knocked him off a roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nevius, 54, was helping secure loose metal sheeting on a nearby 
building Monday so it wouldn't fly off and hurt someone. 
</P>
<P>
 A gust picked up a large sheet, knocking him off the roof. Building owner Don 
Hinds said he and two other men narrowly escaped the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the rest of us had been close to the end, it would have dumped all of us 
off," Hinds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevius fell about 15 feet, striking his head. He underwent surgery to remove a 
blood clot from his brain but never regained consciousness and died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevius was assistant scout master of Troop 104 in Fremont.

RENTS RAVAGING MOBILE HOME PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The committees of the four Lake Forest mobile home parks wish to express 
their appreciation for the article "Wheels Turning at Mobile Home Parks in 
O.C." (April 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the four parks (with 1,228 homes) have been trying to get some 
relief from the Lake Forest City Council for almost two years, with no 
success.Council members feel we need help, but they must feel that if they do 
something to help us, the four mobile home park owners will file a lawsuit 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived in El Toro Mobile Estates for 19 years, and I fully expected to 
spend my remaining years in this park. For the first nine years, the rent was 
governed by the Consumer Price Index. Since 1984, our rent has increased double 
the CPI. There are 50 homes for sale; 10 have been abandoned; and six people 
moved their homes from the park and have started their own real estate agency. 
</P>
<P>
 We have 150 widows living in this park; some are not going to be able to 
remain here and are not able to sell their homes either.

TRUSTEE DISPUTES BOARD'S LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I must respond to Keith Breon's letter to the editor (April 3), since he has 
used his contract with the Santa Ana school district as legal counsel as basis 
for his letter. Breon is not representing my views or beliefs in any way 
pertaining to the issues he presented, nor did he get prior approval from the 
Board of Education to debate the issue in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Breon rightfully points to appraisals or communications related to 
negotiations for the sale or purchase of property as proper closed-session 
agenda items. With the exception of a tongue-lashing in closed session to 
certain board members by Mr. Breon, neither of the documents used to censure 
board member Rosemarie Avila were discussed in closed session or even meet his 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not an appraisal nor do we yet have an appraisal of the Bristol 
Marketplace site. The memo cited was an estimate strictly used to encourage the 
state to set aside $22 million for the site, which they did. This became public 
knowledge in state executive minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 If everything is on the up and up, the district does not have any negotiating 
power in the price of the property, as the state is required to pay the highest 
appraisal price (another bureaucratic bumble). The key to all this is the three 
words "up and up." 
</P>
<P>
 With those three words in mind let's bring on the second memo in question. It 
was a summary of the 1990 purchase of the ECCO site which is currently under 
construction. I had asked for copies of the contract and documents preceding 
the purchase since this was the latest land purchase and I felt it would give 
me a better perspective of how the system works. Boy, did I get a perspective. 
I have yet to receive any of those listed documents. The summary was all that I 
was provided. I questioned how a land purchase four years ago could be 
classified from public knowledge. The answer to that question became obvious 
when the three board members who were on the board when the ECCO deal was 
completed, unjustly and without proof, censured board member Avila. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm hoping the outcome of all this will be a narrative appraisal that's over a 
month late now, that will save the taxpayers of California millions of dollars 
and no repeat of the ECCO deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's legal counsel (Breon) told Avila that at some point she must 
realize she is representing the district. Through the thick of it all, he must 
have gotten our job confused with his, for I represent the people.

GIVE FOOTHILLS' TEENS A PLACE OF THEIR OWN; * PLANNERS WOULD BE WISE TO CREATE 
A YOUTH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A century ago, historian Frederick Jackson Turner wrote that the periodic land 
rushes and western expansion influenced the nation's institutions and 
character, making Americans individualistic, mobile and optimistic. There is 
less land and more people these days, but there are still pioneers, people 
seeking to pull up stakes for newer communities that hold the promise of a 
better life for them and for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent years have seen a building boom in the foothills of southern Orange 
County that brings Turner's thesis to mind. Earlier waves of migration brought 
people from Los Angeles across the county line, and then from North County to 
South County. Now mobility and optimism are at work again, sending families to 
brand-new communities where you can still sometimes see deer and coyotes and 
there are promises of a better future. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite long commutes and a lack of some amenities, the feelings of hope and 
satisfaction in the foothill communities are remarkable. Eighty percent of the 
respondents to a recent Times Orange County poll of residents of the Foothill 
Ranch, Portola Hills, Robinson Ranch, Rancho Santa Margarita, Dove Canyon and 
Coto de Caza said they had very favorable views of their communities. 
Throughout Orange County, only 58% hold the same view. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Baldassare, a UC Irvine urban sociologist whose firm conducted the poll, 
said the suburban dream appeared "alive and well" for the new enclaves' 40,000 
residents. He found these latest pioneers trying "to separate themselves from 
the crime, gangs and urban ills" they perceived elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A key characteristic of the foothills residents is their devotion to family. 
Many are in their 30s and 40s, mothers and fathers of young children. They 
picked their new homes in large part because they were promised their children 
would receive good educations. And two-thirds say they are very satisfied with 
the public schools, far higher than the countywide total, 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a problem with those a little bit older, the teen-agers. And the 
residents of the new communities need to solve it soon. Most of those surveyed 
said they intend to stay where they are for the foreseeable future; that means 
their own elementary school children will be teen-agers before long, and they 
need to fit them into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Co. has been a major developer of the new communities. A 
spokeswoman for the firm said the company has not ruled out a teen center for 
Rancho Santa Margarita. But she said that while teen centers elsewhere do 
provide activities for teens, they also create a place where teens who gather 
sometimes cause trouble. That may be true, but the community would be wise to 
give teens a place to be active. Learn from the other teen centers, too. See 
what causes the trouble there and take steps to prevent it in the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 These are still raw, young communities. Traffic problems can be horrendous, 
though solutions are in sight with freeway widenings and a new toll road. 
Developers should also continue trying to attract light industry and other 
job-creating enterprises to negate the need to commute for some residents. A 
large degree of self-sufficiency is a laudable goal for a community, but it has 
many dimensions, including jobs and recreation, churches and schools, a good 
quality of life for everyone from toddlers to seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems that invariably crop up in new communities cannot be ignored, 
lest the foothills wind up suffering from the same conditions that prompted 
residents to leave their old cities behind.

HOTEL MAID'S REWARD SHOULD BE GREATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I could not believe what I was reading in "Only Scruples Stop Housekeeper 
From Cleaning Up,"(March 31). 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Shirley Rich Wagner (vacationing from Bel Air) did not have the common 
sense to store her valuables in a hotel security safe, but instead left them 
behind a drape? 
</P>
<P>
 Four hundred dollars and a kiss for this honest person to receive as a reward 
for $100,000 in jewelry is pittance. 
</P>
<P>
 The least she could have done for this deed was to buy a small new car for 
Maria Jimenez to commute to school or pay a year's tuition for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see Ms. Wagner live for one week on $6.10 an hour and walk in Maria's 
shoes.

jewels in one of the hotel rooms and returning them. 
</P>
<P>
 Any trusted employee would certainly do that, but there are those who 
wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 I personally think the $400 reward is an insult for having your $100,000 worth 
of jewels returned. And then a "great big kiss." Yuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent of the value would make much more sense of gratification.

OVERDUE HELP FOR POOR MOMS-TO-BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was about time someone did something to help pregnant teen-agers and 
illegal immigrants.The MOMS organization is doing a beautiful job giving all 
women prenatal care that they need. Every woman should be able to obtain the 
proper prenatal care regardless of her residency status. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County-based program, MOMS, is saving us, the taxpayers, great 
deals of money.  
</P>
<P>
 I would love to hear more about other communities starting their own MOMS or 
similar programs.

BORDER IS PLACE TO BLOCK IMMIGRANT INFLUX; * FENCE, WHILE A LIFESAVER, WOULD 
SERVE PURPOSE BETTER IF LOCATED NEAR ENTRY POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a symbol of resolve to get tough on illegal immigration and to save lives, 
it is hard to top the image of a seven-mile-long, eight-foot-high fence. It 
went up last summer in the median strip of Interstate 5 near the U.S. Border 
Patrol checkpoint south of San Clemente. Now some results are in: As of the end 
of last month, no pedestrian fatalities had occurred along an 18-mile stretch 
north of Oceanside to the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 This is great news, for the short term. However, tempting as it may be to 
declare victory in the campaign to stop fleeing immigrants from being killed, 
the situation is more complicated. Karl Hansen, spokesman for the California 
Highway Patrol, notes the "positive impact" of the fence, but cautions that 
people still could be hit by traffic while trying to cross the freeway at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the $458,000 spent constructing the fence has been well spent as a 
stopgap measure. As wildly erratic as the death statistics are from recent 
years -- seven fatalities in 1992, two in 1991, 15 in 1990, for example -- 
there's no quarreling with a measure of deterrence. Credit efforts of the CHP's 
Mexican liaison office to warn people in migrant labor camps of the dangers of 
Southern California freeways. But ultimately, as Hansen says flatly, the good 
record turns as much on luck as anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, there remains no substitute for dealing with immigration problems 
at the border, not miles inland. Dr. Thomas Shaver, director of trauma services 
at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, knows better than 
anyone the human cost of the freeway tragedies, because his facility treats 
many of the victims. And he makes sense when he asks why there needs to be "a 
dangerous obstacle 66 miles" north, after the border has been crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the fence is a lifesaver. But for the long term the same old question 
remains. Why try to stem the tide there when the border is so obviously the 
place to do it?

TAKING EXCEPTION TO INQUIRY, REPORTING IN DEPUTY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The information published about the sheriff's and district attorney's 
offices' investigation(s) of the Deputy Brian Scanlan shooting upsets me ("Why 
Secrecy in Shooting Probe," Platform, April 1).  
</P>
<P>
 Although it does not appear that Deputy Scanlan intended the death of Deputy 
Darryn Robins, it does appear that he acted without caution and he certainly 
violated department training policy by using a loaded weapon. It has been noted 
that Deputy Robins' concealed weapon was unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Deputy Scanlan above the law that protects citizens like Darryn Robins from 
careless and deadly acts? Would ordinary individuals be given the same 
consideration if they accidentally, but carelessly, hit a child with their car? 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was not conducted in the normal manner, and the need for the 
grand jury investigation was unusual, according to (your Platform article by) a 
former deputy district attorney. Why was the district attorney's initial 
recommendation for a manslaughter charge not pursued? 
</P>
<P>
 GENE P. MORRIS 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * With respect to your story about the Orange County sheriff's deputy who shot 
his partner, I can only wonder why you chose the word "cocky" to lead your 
article with ("O.C. Deputy Felt 'Cocky' During Fatal Exercise," March 24). 
There was, to my knowledge, 5 1/2 hours of testimony from Deputy (Brian P.) 
Scanlan, numerous other hours of testimony from the others at the scene and 
involved in the subsequent investigation, not to mention the videotapes. 
Perhaps this was the only word out of all the thousands of words that would 
throw a bad light on the situation. Perhaps your intent was to put the issue to 
the public in such a way as to do the most damage to the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was your intent to slant the news, you did a fine job. If it was your 
intent to belittle an individual, ditto. If you hoped to make a terrible 
situation worse, you accomplished it.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I can't begin to tell you how disgusting I found your article on the Scanlan 
shooting. The story was rife with innuendoes and pejorative language, which 
seemed to imply that the deputy was somehow indifferent to the fact that he had 
just killed a fellow officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of treating the information which the district attorney released 
factually, you appear to go out of your way to create controversy, seemingly 
indifferent to the fact that Deputy Scanlan was no doubt in severe shock during 
the initial interrogations. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age when we have more than enough controversy and racial tension to go 
around, it is a shame that your reporters found it ethical and appropriate to 
attempt to create more.

Officer's Killing," March 11) on the not so accidental killing of Deputy Darryn 
Robins last Christmas Day. Same also for your editorial March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 How in God's name can your reporters keep from laughing in the faces of the 
police spokesman? Do the police actually believe the public is that stupid? 
Their silence, followed by obscene explanations, is beyond belief.

STORIES AFTER 2 SLAYINGS MISSED POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This letter is in regard to two articles that were written last week in your 
newspaper: "U.S. Rushes to Reassure Japan After Carjacking" (March 29) and 
"Another PR Nightmare for O.C.'s Tourist Trade" (March 30). 
</P>
<P>
 I am particularly interested in the use of extreme and rash terms to describe 
the events surrounding the carjacking/killing of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura: 
slaying, shock, frantic, gun-infested, outrage, vicious. This is nothing more 
than the usual media ploy to hype and embellish the truth, to manipulate the 
events so that they occur in the minds of the public exactly how the media 
would like them to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is portrayed to us that (L.A. Mayor) Richard Riordan and Gov. Pete 
Wilson, being the honorable politicians that they are, are not going to rest 
until they see that our streets are cleaned up and that our cities are crime 
free. Somehow I think they, in their large suburban homes, will be resting just 
fine. They are interested in stopping crime now that California economics are 
put in further danger. African Americans, Latino and Asian American citizens 
have been "carjacked" for decades. What an insult to these particular victims' 
families and friends to turn this into a "PR Nightmare." It is so much more 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese editorialist who questions, "For a car?" and those who would 
chime in with him must understand that this is not about a car. Carjacking is 
one of the many urban crimes that involves much more than a person wanting 
something that someone else owns. Carjacking manifests a desperation and a 
sense of powerlessness in which one must exercise power over another in order 
to sustain some sense of self-reliance, self-determination and self-worth. It 
is deplorable that these two young men were killed, not because they were 
Japanese students but because they were in the unfortunate circumstance of 
being in the wrong place at the wrong time. More than a sense of loss to the 
California economy should be felt. Rather, what should be addressed by the 
media, politicians, teachers, religious leaders, etc., is the environment which 
produces hopeless, desperate young people with no sense of self-worth or hope 
for a respected and protected future. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a hopelessly ill and pathetically depressed society, and it is more so 
drawn to my attention when I read articles such as those which perpetuate the 
ghetto stereotypes that young black and Latino men are all gang-bangers, out to 
hurt, destroy and even slay anyone and everyone; and that white, wealthy 
politicians are here to save the day by single-handedly making our streets 
clean, our society virtuous and our cities available for widespread tourism. It 
is a battle out there, yes. But the battle has nothing to do with financial 
repercussions, national reputation or long-term strategies to improve 
tourist/city relations. I hope that you will begin to address the real issues 
behind crime, depression and the nihilistic threats to our society.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON HATE CRIMES; IS IT A FANATIC FEW WHO ARE

<P>
 As I listen to the play of my children in the background and hear an 
occasional "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!" I wonder if hate is just a 
normal part of growing up, something that we say, but don't really mean. I 
think also of all of the times when I think, or even say to my friends or 
colleagues, I hate this or that, with real feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 When swastikas were painted on the walls of a synagogue in Westminster, some 
asked if hate crime is really just kids looking for attention. Youth acting out 
in the most outrageous way they can imagine, seizing the most odious symbols 
without even understanding what they stand for. Surely they are not little 
Nazis intent on exterminating millions of people they consider inferior, or a 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 When vicious, nasty, racist anti-Latino flyers were distributed at schools in 
Newport, Laguna and Capistrano several weeks ago, many assumed that it was 
probably done by people from outside the school, outside the community -- not 
from here. We wanted to believe that this hateful behavior was not from within, 
it must have been perpetrated by "outsiders." We all know that "outsiders" 
bring all sorts of evil into our midst. They are responsible for the decline of 
our economy. They are responsible for the slipping academic standards in our 
schools. They are responsible for the growing violence in our neighborhoods. 
They are responsible for the breakdown in the moral fabric of our county, state 
and country. 
</P>
<P>
 When an African American student at Saddleback College was repeatedly 
threatened with racist notes, people asked if this was the work of a madman, 
certainly not coming from one of our normal students -- certainly not 
indicative of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 When anti-gay literature was distributed in Fountain Valley, we wanted to 
believe that it was just a disagreement over a religious issue, that no one 
would actually act out these hateful expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 When anti-Asian epithets were painted on the library elevator walls at UC 
Irvine, we assumed that the perpetrators were not university students in the 
library to study, but instead probably were non-students looking for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a handsome, popular, athletic high school student and his friends 
from the beautiful middle-class suburban city of San Clemente got together and 
traveled to Laguna Beach in an area frequented by gay men and jumped a man they 
presumed to be gay, and beat him beyond recognition, within an inch of his life 
. . . we could no longer comfort ourselves with the thought that this hate was 
not a part of the very fabric of our community. 
</P>
<P>
 When that young man initiated that vicious attack: 
</P>
<P>
 What was the responsibility of his friends who stood by and did nothing to 
stop this heinous act? 
</P>
<P>
 What was the responsibility of his parents for the attitude this young person 
had about a fellow human being? 
</P>
<P>
 What was the responsibility of the neighbors who interacted with this young 
man as he developed his values toward different people? 
</P>
<P>
 What was the responsibility of his teachers and schools to teach him to value 
diversity and respect all people? 
</P>
<P>
 What was the responsibility of the Orange County Human Relations Commission to 
prevent this hate from taking seed and growing in our county? 
</P>
<P>
 What is your responsibility to get involved in protecting those who are 
vilified, teaching respect through all of the institutions that you participate 
in, holding accountable opportunists who preach hate to galvanize their 
followers, supporting human relations institutions to move us toward a future 
where we are brought together in our rich diversity, not torn apart by our 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 180 hate-related incidents that the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission documented in 1993, there were considerable reasons for concern: 
</P>
<P>
 * White supremacist literature was distributed in lockers at high schools all 
over the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * The offices of the Jewish Family Services had their windows shattered and 
swastikas painted in 2-foot-high red letters on their walls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Death epithets against Latinos were painted on a high school. 
</P>
<P>
 * An African American woman had a truckload of white men yell racial epithets 
and fire three shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bar had a Molotov cocktail thrown at it by a person who drove by yelling 
anti-gay slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Vietnamese American woman was assaulted in a parking lot by three men who 
berated her with obscene anti-Asian epithets as they surrounded and pushed her 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 * A white victim was shot and robbed by an African American who told a friend 
he was going to get "whitey." 
</P>
<P>
 The overall number of incidents was down slightly and incidents against 
African Americans and Asians were down significantly, but incidents against 
gays and Jews were up. 
</P>
<P>
 These statistics are the result of the collaboration of every law enforcement 
agency in the county and hate crime victim groups in the Hate Crime Network. We 
are as a community doing better in responding to hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 We must as a community now focus on prevention. We must look at the way in 
which the vilification of elements of our community, if unchecked, unleashes 
our fringes with a violent vengeance. We must examine the standards of behavior 
that we accept in dealing with people who we just don't believe the same as. We 
must look at our communal responsibility for educating all with whom we come 
into contact.

CROWDED DWELLINGS ARE DANGEROUS, DAMAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The fundamental role of government is to protect lives. So, The Times is 
correct when it points out that the city of Santa Ana has persistently sought 
the ability to govern residential occupancy standards ("Using Safety as Tenet 
in Occupancy Issue," Editorial, March 27). 
</P>
<P>
 Current state law sets the maximum number of residents in a dwelling unit. 
Historically, this was determined by counting the square footage in bedrooms. 
This changed radically, however, as the result of a court decision which said 
you must count all 'habitable' areas for sleeping purposes (i.e., dining rooms, 
living rooms, etc.) in a dwelling to come up with the occupancy level. What 
this now means is that a 600-square-foot apartment can be legally occupied by 
10 people! 
</P>
<P>
 This is the state law and it does expose people to life-threatening risks. 
Residential units were never built to handle the occupancy loads allowed by the 
state's new math. 
</P>
<P>
 People have died. This evidence is compelling. In late 1991, Santa Ana Fire 
Battalion Chief Tom Skelly told me that there would be fire deaths in our city 
and it was just a question of when, due to severely overcrowded conditions 
sanctioned by the state. Just a few days later, three were killed in such 
conditions. Six more people would be burned to death and 10 would be injured in 
the following 13 months. The evidence is compelling and heart-wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 We have sought a legislative remedy because the state bureaucracy is unwilling 
or unable to explain why the existing standard is safe. Our approach is to 
restore common sense to the equation by giving local cities the ability to 
legislate in this area. Presently, local governments may only set a different 
occupancy standard than the state standard of 10 per 600-square-foot apartment 
when a finding based on climate, topography or geology is made. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously occupancy is unrelated to weather, earthquakes or hill slides. 
Nonetheless, the state Department of Housing and Community Development has 
stated that there should be a lower occupancy standard (2 per bedroom plus 1) 
for developments supported or subsidized by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should only the fortunate few who qualify for state programs have safe and 
affordable housing? It seems, instead, the state of California is blindly 
endorsing a policy that is unsafe. And if the answer is ultimately to build 
more housing, how many communities will step up when one must assume occupancy 
based on 10 people in 600 square feet? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we're persistent. As Battalion Chief Skelly told me back in 1991, when 
the fire deaths occur, city officials will be asked what was done to address 
this problem. We've presented the issue to the state officials who make the 
rules. We will gladly explain our evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 It only seems reasonable that the state housing and community development 
officials explain their evidence and methodology that results in a residential 
unit with 10 people in 600 square feet. Why not have a state policy that 
provides for both housing and safety? 
</P>

 ROBERT L. RICHARDSON 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * Your recent editorial in support of the families who are overcrowding the 
apartments in Santa Ana is just another example of muddle-headed, feel-good 
thinking that is destroying neighborhoods not only in our inner cities but in 
other communities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 I am on the board of directors of a condo association in Mission Viejo and we 
are experiencing some of the same overcrowding problems that Santa Ana is 
facing. 
</P>
<P>
 We have as many as 12 or more people jammed into rental condos with an 
occupancy limit of five, according to the CC&Rs of the association. 
</P>
<P>
 This has led to excessive noise, destruction of the landscape, increased wear 
and tear on the facilities, vandalism, graffiti, theft and other problems we 
never faced until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy of the situation is that many young first-time buyers and elderly 
retirees are seeing their property values decrease and their rights to the 
quiet enjoyment of their unit being trampled upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, your paper and the state seem to be on the side of the ones 
doing the overcrowding. My gut feeling is that you don't give a damn about the 
poor, your main concern is keeping a large labor pool of low-wage workers to 
fill jobs in the fast-food, retail and other low-paying industries. 
</P>
<P>
 I would wager that if you check into the overcrowding problems you will find 
that some of those who are involved are having a good portion of their rent 
paid by HUD, another well-intended but failed government program. 
</P>
<P>
 You might also find that some of the money saved on rent is being sent back to 
Mexico or other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupancy rules set by the state courts that allow up to 19 people in a 
two-bedroom apartment will not solve the affordable housing problems, it will 
only lead to chaos, crime, the breakup of families, slums and other social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The state will be better off when it empowers local communities to set their 
own reasonable occupancy limits. Maybe then we can make our communities more 
manageable and as a result safer and more livable.

HURTT CASE ILLUSTRATES NEED FOR REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your recent expose on Orange County state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), 
the wealthy businessman from Garden Grove, revealed the insidious use of PACs 
to get around contribution limits ("O.C. Sen. Hurtt Presses On Toward 
Conservative Goals," April 4).  
</P>
<P>
 Since federal and state election laws prevent individuals from making more 
than a $1,000 campaign contribution, Rob Hurtt and three wealthy Christian 
businessmen (Howard Ahmanson, Edward Atsinger III and Roland Hinz) did what 
many others have discovered as a way around contribution limits and formed 
Allied Business PAC. Through this "paper entity," they can each funnel many 
thousands of dollars to candidates of their choice, thus rendering the $1,000 
individual limit meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it a real contradiction in moral behavior, when so-called "Christian" 
men (such as those behind the Allied Business PAC) use such unethical methods 
to dominate the election of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 They should be setting a higher moral standard in the conduct of our elections 
-- not adding to the problems already created by those who seek to control the 
election of public officials through their financial wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County voters passed a new campaign finance ordinance in June, 1992. 
Unlike state and federal laws, our ordinance limits PAC contributions to the 
same limit that individuals are subject to. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Orange County elections are somewhat free of the influence of tons of 
money shuffled through the PACs by wealthy individuals who would otherwise not 
be allowed to make excessively large contributions.

 * Your article (April 4) on Sen. Rob Hurtt and the political power of his 
political action committee is a good illustration of how important it is to 
limit the power of PACs and institute sound campaign finance reform in our 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic democratic principle of one man, one vote is being defeated when we 
allow a small handful of wealthy persons to effectively buy their way into the 
state legislature.

TOO MUCH TRIFLING WITH JURY SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have been following with personal interest the news items in The Times 
regarding the developments connected to the conviction of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis 
in the attack on Aissa Wayne and Roger Luby in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the jury which convicted Dr. Gionis, I was appalled when I read 
later of the overthrow of that conviction by the 4th District Court of Appeal. 
According to the latest report in The Times (March 29), that court's summary 
decision is now being questioned by our state attorney general's staff in an 
appeal to the California Supreme Court to review that lower court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel personally troubled that our jury system can be so easily circumvented. 
I believe in the jury system, and feel that it, when properly conducted, 
reflects the basic principles of our democratically founded judicial system. 
What is happening to our judicial system when decisions arrived at by a 
dedicated jury can be so subverted? 
</P>
<P>
 The Times report mentioned the appellate court's decision as being 3 to 0. 
That means that only three judges successfully negated the results of a 
lengthy, (and, I presume, expensive) well-conducted trial presided over by a 
patient, well-qualified judge, culminating in a conviction by a diverse, 
intelligent, fair-minded 12-member jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Our jury listened carefully to all the evidence presented, considered all 
salient points of testimony, and gave due consideration to all facets in our 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the prosecuting attorney's closing remarks were cited by the appellate 
court judges as partial grounds for their decision to reverse our jury's 
conviction. May I say that, as a jury member, we were not swayed by either of 
the attorneys capsulated, emotional remarks in their closing speeches. The 
preponderance of the previous weeks' evidence was the basis for our decision. 
</P>
<P>
 I will be waiting for the results of the state lawyers' petitioning of our 
California Supreme Court to review this case.

A COWBOY TALE; WACKY FOOTBALL FEUD WAS ABOUT MONEY, EGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ATTNER, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you like your tales filled with a mixture of powerful people, the lure of 
money, the egos of the elite, the feuding of the Hatfields and McCoys and even 
a little hint of sex, this one might prove too good to be true. But trust us, 
nothing has been changed to protect the innocent. And just think, we once 
thought sports gave us a fantasy world of relief from real life's impurities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter One: A group of friends is sitting at a table with Dallas Cowboys 
Coach Jimmy Johnson. They are all former Cowboys employees, including a couple 
who were fired by owner Jerry Jones. They are attending a social function in 
conjunction with the National Football League winter meetings in Orlando, Fla. 
Jones spots them and wanders over to say hello. Inspired, he raises his glass 
to toast the continued success of the Cowboys. Of those sitting at the table, 
only Johnson makes any effort to respond, and even his acknowledgment is 
half-hearted. No question, Jones isn't welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 To Jones, the greeting is symbolic of a more troubling problem. Johnson and 
those around him have never shown him the respect the owner thinks he deserves. 
He knows they laugh at him behind his back, particularly when he takes credit 
for any football-related move associated with the Cowboys. From the outside, 
everything should be perfect for the Cowboys: They've won consecutive Super 
Bowls, they've got a young team that will be favored to capture an 
unprecedented third, and they are making money, lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson grates more and more at what he perceives as Jones' ever-growing 
desire to be cast as the Cowboys' savior. The football people in the 
organization want Jones to receive no recognition at all, except for having the 
common sense to hire Johnson five years ago from the University of Miami even 
though Johnson had no pro coaching experience. Johnson and his cohorts are 
amazed at the enormity of Jones' ego. The irony is that he really doesn't 
interfere with their ability to run the football operations. He just demands 
they keep him informed of what they are doing, so he can give his blessing 
before the moves are implemented. Even though Johnson and Jones vary between 
talking a lot and a little, depending on their moods, the Cowboys remain the 
most aggressive, responsive and effective organization in the National Football 
League. Jones needs to be stroked, that's all, but they prefer for him to go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 But what does it take to keep Johnson satisfied? He is being paid $1 million a 
year, he is universally credited with being the brains behind the rejuvenation 
of this once-proud club, he is one championship away from almost certain 
induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Yet just before the regular season 
ends, he expresses interest in jumping to the expansion team in Jacksonville, 
knowing it would rub Jones wrong. More than anything else, Jones demands deeply 
committed loyalty, and Johnson shows signs of distancing himself from his boss. 
Now this group in Orlando is laughing at Jones, too. Even though Johnson has 
five years left on his contract, Jones previously decided he would have an 
off-season meeting with his coach to straighten things out. Johnson has to 
re-establish his long-term commitment -- with free agency and the salary cap, 
Jones isn't interested in a coach who would stay maybe one more year -- or 
Jones is prepared to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
 The snub at the party outrages Jones and churns at his gut. Let them laugh. He 
adjourns to a bar in his hotel and has a few. Then a few more. He starts 
talking to reporters, telling them he should fire Johnson, that 500 coaches 
could win with the Cowboys, that Barry Switzer would be a great replacement. 
Tossing out Switzer's name has special meaning. Johnson and Switzer were 
college coaching rivals when Switzer was at Oklahoma and Johnson was first at 
Oklahoma State and then at Miami. In many ways they are much alike, but in 
truth, Johnson dislikes Switzer, who was the freshman coach of Jones and 
Johnson at Arkansas. If Jones wants to really outrage Johnson, he knows the 
correct button to push. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is outraged. Informed of Jones' outburst, Johnson storms from the 
meetings two days early. His fragile ego is aching. He has never spent more 
than five years at any head-coaching job, and he already has put in five years 
with Dallas. An intensely driven man, he needs to be reassured constantly about 
his achievements. He is angered by every imagined slight, outraged sometimes by 
the smallest mistake. He is a control and neatness fanatic, a man who can never 
get enough of the spotlight. He rarely has a spontaneous moment, carefully 
planning the messages he sends to his players, opponents and, yes, owner 
through the media. He loves to party, drink beer and eat Mexican food, but he 
is wound so tightly, especially during the season, that there is a constant 
tension around the Cowboys' office. He doesn't have a lot of friends and does 
little to broaden his circle. Courting favor is not a Johnson strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of Johnson's restlessness and Jones' uneasiness drives the two 
toward the owner's desired meeting. They exchange jabs through the press. The 
secretive Johnson suddenly is available for all types of interviews. He even 
flies in his mother and father, who rarely are seen in his company, to his 
Florida vacation spot. He appears on the verge of crying. Jones is being 
outmaneuvered by the master manipulator. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter Two: The two college friends finally decide to talk March 25 in 
Dallas. Or were they friends? Not really. They played on the same college team 
and roomed on the road because their names were next to each other in 
alphabetical order. But Jones hired Johnson because he was smart enough to 
recognize Johnson's coaching acumen. And Jones always has felt more comfortable 
surrounded by people he has known. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is business, and those old college ties mean nothing. People get the 
wrong read on Jones if they just listen to him talk in public. With his 
Arkansas drawl, he comes off as a country bumpkin. He and Johnson would chuckle 
about it, knowing that the rest of the NFL thought they were the second coming 
of Homer and Jethro. But engage Jones in a business conversation and out comes 
the side that made a fortune in the oil business. He is a tough, shrewd thinker 
who never reacts spontaneously in a business deal. He is bottom-line Jerry, 
tight with the buck and driven to succeed. The kind of person you shouldn't 
underestimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they have gotten along for five years and with the success this team 
has had, you would think they could work something out," Cowboys center Mark 
Stepnoski says. But the two men never really wanted to compromise. Jones goes 
into the meeting convinced that the chances of Johnson staying are far less 
than the chances of him being released. Just in case, Jones already has called 
Switzer, to make sure he has a replacement ready. Maybe if Johnson agrees to 
coach five more years with the same commitment and fire that characterized the 
last five, then the duo can continue to function. But Johnson wants one more 
season, period. He already has been spending less time in the off-season at the 
Cowboys' complex than he had in previous years, even though key incumbent free 
agents, such as Stepnoski and guard Nate Newton, need to be courted and 
resigned. There isn't as much desire as before, and winning a third Super Bowl 
really isn't that important to him, at least not enough to put up with an owner 
who can't get his shadow out of Johnson's spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 By the second day of the meetings, it is obvious their tenure is over. Johnson 
considers the two equal; Jones, as owner, thinks he is the boss. It is Jones' 
team; why should he back off from his role in personnel matters? Jones hands 
Johnson a $2 million severance offer. In exchange, Johnson can coach anywhere 
else immediately, but he agrees to talk positively about the breakup. Then, the 
two hold one of the most bizarre news conferences in sports history. They act 
like best pals who just won the lottery. But a grim-faced Johnson is packed and 
out of his office by early the next morning. Cowboys players, who rebelled 
sometimes at his psychological maneuvering but loved his drive and enthusiasm, 
are told to go to his house to say goodbye. Even in the end, Jimmy is 
choreographing their every move. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter Three: Barry Switzer? The same guy who hasn't coached anywhere since 
1988, his final season with an Oklahoma program that had lost control of its 
players. The same guy who never has coached in the pros? That Barry Switzer 
sits with Jones at yet another news conference, this one a day after Johnson is 
released. Switzer, the third head coach in Cowboys history, the guy who admits 
he thought he would never get a chance in the NFL, occasionally gets so 
enthusiastic it's almost laughable. He upstages his boss. He whacks him on the 
back. He makes people laugh. He is spontaneous. He is not Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 But given his Arkansas ties -- and his ties with Jones -- the hiring makes 
sense. He is high-profile, he is a motivator, he is a players' coach. Johnson 
also is all three. But Switzer is much looser, less moody, less prone to rebel 
at slights. He has an ego, but it hardly rivals Johnson's. Switzer is a good 
ol' boy, a skirt chaser, a party animal. His friends say he can coach; others 
say that Xs and O's were never a strength. But Jones knows Switzer is 
inheriting a great staff of assistants -- Johnson left much of the football 
stuff to his aides -- and Jones believes his new coach is smart enough not to 
interfere. He needs a skilled point man, and Switzer fills that need. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost too easy to dismiss Switzer as a Jones pawn. "It's Goober hiring 
dunce," Switzer jokes. Maybe that will be his role. But, unlike Johnson, 
Switzer is fully aware of who is in charge. Switzer is a leader in the Johnson 
mode; his main task will be to win over the affection of the Cowboys players. 
Receiver Michael Irvin, who reacts to Johnson's fate by throwing an empty 
garbage can at would-be TV interviewers, says, "Ultimately, I don't give a damn 
who the coach is. I'm going to still work out because I've still got to play." 
Stacey Dillard, the New York Giants' defensive lineman who played for Switzer 
at Oklahoma, says the new Cowboys coach "gets everything possible out of his 
players. He's a players' coach. And he knew how to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer leaves to spend the weekend studying the playbook "so I can learn what 
a forward pass is." He already has dealt with two major problems. Quarterback 
Troy Aikman played for Switzer at Oklahoma after being promised the Sooners 
would utilize a passing attack. But Aikman suffered a broken leg his sophomore 
season, and Oklahoma went on to win the national title with the wishbone. When 
Aikman realized Switzer wasn't going to abandon the 'bone, he transferred to 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure he is the best coach for the situation," Aikman says before 
Switzer is hired. After Switzer signs up, Aikman is more optimistic. "I think 
the chance of us repeating for the third Super Bowl is as realistic as before," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer also meets with Larry Lacewell, his former trusted assistant at 
Oklahoma. During a lawsuit involving his book, "Bootlegger's Boy," Switzer 
testifies that he had an affair with Lacewell's now ex-wife. Lacewell 
eventually joins the Cowboys, where he directs college scouting before being 
elevated last week to head the personnel department. Lacewell will direct the 
draft, but Jones will make the selections, a role Johnson had filled. Switzer 
says he will be an onlooker at this year's draft. After all, he isn't aware 
there no longer are 12 rounds. And Lacewell claims that the two men have made 
up and can work together just splendidly. Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Epilogue: In his second day as coach of the Cowboys, Barry Switzer learns 
that reserve tight end Alfredo Roberts, who spent the 1993 season on injured 
reserve, has been released. Switzer gets the news on his car radio. "I don't 
have an ego that allows me to be put in a position to injure" his relationship 
with Jones, Switzer has said earlier. That ego already is being tested. The 
head coach of the Cowboys no longer is in charge of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours later, Jerry Jones is sitting in the living room of his 
vacation place in Florida. In the background, a grandchild is laughing. Three 
days have passed since he severed ties with Jimmy Johnson, and Jones knows that 
around the NFL lots of people are laughing at him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's heard the laughter before from these football people. When he bought the 
Cowboys, man, did they chortle. Those two had no chance, none; after all, who 
was going to do the drafting? Who was going to teach Johnson to coach in the 
NFL? 
</P>
<P>
 After rebuilding the Cowboys into champs . . . after parlaying a $140 million 
investment that bought him a team and a stadium into a sum worth perhaps twice 
as much in five years . . . after becoming one of the most influential owners 
in the league, Jones believes he should have earned everyone's respect. Indeed, 
he feels that if he had been general manager alone, without the owner's tag, he 
would have been highly honored, perhaps been chosen Executive of the Year at 
least once, for what the Cowboys have accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there will be no question who really is the general manager of Dallas. 
But he won't be doing it alone. Just without Jimmy.

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; SHE'S CONSIDERING COURTS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On her 18th birthday recently, Jennifer Capriati accepted an invitation to be 
an alternate on the U.S. team that will play in the Federation Cup on July 
18-24 at Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "She indicated that, after high school, she's really going to start thinking 
about tennis again," U.S. Captain Marty Riessen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who hasn't played since August, said in January that she was taking 
a break while rekindling an interest in the sport. She indicated, however, that 
she probably would return after graduating from Pascual County High in 
Saddlebrook, Fla., on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon starts 11 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who has earned almost $1.5 million on the WTA Tour and won a gold 
medal in the 1992 Olympic Games, has moved back with her family after living on 
her own in a nearby apartment for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know she's been out hitting the ball and working out a little bit, getting 
back slowly, at her own pace," her mother, Denise, said from Wesley Chapel, 
Fla. "Obviously, she wants to play again. It's just a matter of getting school 
over and done with, then totally focusing on whatever she wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing it the smart way, just kind of enjoying the rest of her senior 
year and hanging out." 
</P>
<P>
 Riessen said Capriati was receptive to the idea of being an alternate on a 
team that will include Mary Joe Fernandez, Zina Garrison Jackson, Gigi 
Fernandez and another high school senior, Lindsay Davenport, 17, of Murrieta 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who helped the U.S. team win the Federation Cup in 1990, will be 
called upon only if one of the others is injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we couldn't pick Jennifer for the team because she's not playing," 
Riessen said. 
</P>

 Mixed reviews: Riessen welcomes the transformation of the Federation Cup, 
which next year will drop its one-week, one-site-a-year format to adopt a 
schedule similar to the Davis Cup's. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's eight quarterfinalists will make up next year's World Group, with 
the non-qualifiers relegated to zonal competition. Ties consisting of four 
singles matches, followed by a doubles match, will be played over two days at 
sites chosen by the host nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterfinals will be played in April, semifinals in July and the finalin 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the one chance for the event to grow into being a serious 
event," Riessen said. "Right now, it's a nice event, but it doesn't get that 
much coverage and notice in the total calendar. I think it needs a jump-start." 
</P>
<P>
 Gigi Fernandez, the world's No. 1 doubles player, wasn't happy about the 
placement of the doubles match, believing that it should be played before the 
last two singles matches. Most matches, she said, will be decided before the 
doubles match is played. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really upset about it," she said. "If doubles is going to be dead, why do 
I want to schlep all around the world to cheer?" 
</P>

 Passage from India: Tom Gullickson, in his first year as captain of the U.S. 
Davis Cup team, was prepared for the worst before he made his debut against 
India last month at New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his fears, the U.S. team of Jim Courier, Todd Martin, Patrick McEnroe 
and Richey Reneberg was a 5-0 winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody got sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took our own chef and we took a lot of our own food and all of our own 
water," Gullickson said. "And we even had the guys brush their teeth with Evian 
water, so they didn't use any water from the hotel tap system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I thought everything went quite well. Everybody stayed healthy, and 
when we got down there, all the boys worked pretty hard. There was a real good 
team spirit and a real camaraderie between the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullickson said Courier and Pete Sampras have expressed interest in playing 
against the Netherlands in a quarterfinal match July 15-17 at Rotterdam, "but I 
haven't talked to anybody specifically about playing." 
</P>

 Let's play five: The WTA Tour is not expected to oppose the decision by the 
Australian Open to change the format of its women's final from a best-of-three 
to a best-of-five-sets event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will help showcase women's tennis a bit," said Gerard Smith, the 
tour's executive director. "I've spoken to several of the top players and there 
doesn't seem to be any objection to it. I think the players are capable of 
staging a very exciting five-set final." 
</P>
<P>
 The season-ending Virginia Slims Championships has been the only event with a 
best-of-five women's final. 
</P>
<P>
 It has gone to five sets once, Monica Seles overcoming a 2-1 deficit to defeat 
Gabriela Sabatini in 1990. Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch are expected to announce Monday that they will build a temporary 
12,500-capacity outdoor stadium on the waterfront in Rotterdam for their 
quarterfinal Davis Cup match against the United States. The Dutch team on the 
hard court is expected to include Richard Krajicek, who returned to the ATP 
Tour last week after being sidelined four months because of a knee injury, and 
the world's No. 1-ranked doubles team, Paul Haarhuis and Jacco Eltingh. 
Haarhuis, ranked 22nd, is also expected to play singles. . . . Krajicek, ranked 
24th, said of his time away from the tour: "The first week, it was a holiday. 
Then I got bored." 
</P>
<P>
 Zina Garrison Jackson, a late addition last season, will again play for the 
Newport Beach Dukes during the World TeamTennis season, which runs July 6-Aug. 
7. Also playing for Coach Angel Lopez: Kelly Jones, Trevor Kronemann and Larisa 
Neiland. . . . Hana Mandlikova, winner of four Grand Slam singles titles, and 
Bud Collins, a Boston Globe columnist and NBC broadcaster, were selected as 
inductees into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I. . . . 
Until last month, when she was upset by Bettina Fulco-Villella at Houston and 
Ines Gorrochategui at Hilton Head Island, S.C., Martina Navratilova hadn't lost 
in the first round of consecutive tournaments since 1974.

AUTO RACING; NASCAR DRIVERS SHUDDER AT 'MIDNIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "Midnight" rolls around on NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit, there's a 
collective shudder among many competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the nickname for Rusty Wallace's favorite car. It used to be a Pontiac 
Grand Prix, but the Ronnie Hopkins-built chassis has found new life this season 
with Ford Thunderbird sheet metal and a Ford engine. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wallace had a tire failure and hit the wall two weeks ago at Darlington, 
it marked only the second time that Midnight has finished out of the top five 
in 21 races in which he has driven it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Darlington event, Wallace started eighth and led five times for 56 laps 
before hitting the third-turn wall. The car spent 75 laps in the garage area 
before Wallace was able to return to action, completing 218 of 293 laps and 
finishing 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team did a great job in getting me back out there," said Wallace, the 
1993 Winston Cup runner-up to Dale Earnhardt. "Most teams would have surveyed 
the damage and loaded the car into the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked up at least four spots by doing what we did. Those points gained 
could prove super important to us when November rolls around. We take some 
consolation in knowing how strong of a race car we had -- even after the 
crash." 
</P>
<P>
 The car was sent out Hopkins for quick repairs and returned to the Penske shop 
by that Tuesday to be prepared for this Sunday's race on the half-mile oval at 
Bristol, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the first of three straight weeks of short-track action for the 
Winston Cup cars, and Wallace feels good about that after finishing no worse 
than second -- with five victories -- in the last nine races on tracks shorter 
than one mile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race last month at Richmond, a three-quarter-mile oval, Wallace began 
the short track season with a runner-up finish to Ernie Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace is 13th in series points, trailing leader Irvan by a substantial 300 
after the first five races of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running a little bit behind of where I'd hopes to be and where I 
thought we'd be, as far as the points and the statistics go. But it certainly 
isn't because of any shortcomings within our operation or any lack of 
performance," said Wallace, who won earlier this season at Rockingham. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a car capable of winning all five races so far, so we can't ask for 
anything more out of the equipment. We've had the car to beat and then have 
tires blown, side windows break out -- freaky deals. . . . There's 26 more 
races filled with opportunity, plenty of time to put the necessary numbers on 
the board." 
</P>
<P>
 THE LAST THREE spring races at Bristol International Raceway have been won 
from the pole, as have four of the last six races on the half-mile, high-banked 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts the Unocal 76 Challenge bonus, which has grown to $83,600, in 
serious jeopardy for Sunday's Food City 500. The money goes to any driver 
winning from the pole position and builds at $7,600 per race until it is won. 
</P>
<P>
 The last driver to take the prize was Ernie Irvan, when he won from the pole 
at Martinsville, Va., last September. 
</P>
<P>
 KEN SCHRADER SAYS Indy-car veteran Gary Bettenhausen, who once finished second 
in the Indianapolis 500, will drive one of his Winston Cup Chevrolets on Aug. 6 
in the inaugural Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrader's Busch Grand National team will pit the car at Indy and Bettenhausen 
plans to test on the 2.5-mile speedway oval in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Schrader tried out Bettenhausen's Indy car at the speedway last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made one lap at about 165 (m.p.h.) and the second lap was about 180," 
Schrader said. "Then I parked it, because I was having too much fun. I didn't 
need to be going that fast or having that much fun."

VOICES: THE COP WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR; BUCKING THE TREND OF LOS ANGELES OFFICERS 
RESIDING OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS, KEITH THOMAS SEES DEFINITE ADVANTAGES TO LIVING 
NEAR WHERE HE WORKS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH THOMAS, According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 83% of Los 
Angeles police officers live outside the city. Keith Thomas isn't one of 
themand he wouldn't live anywhere but South-Central. The 34-year-old officer, 
who lives near the 77th Street Division station, grew up around South Hoover 
Street and attended Fremont High School. The nine-year veteran of the Los 
Angeles Police Department says his roots in the community make his job 
easierand make residents feel more secure. Thomas was interviewed by Sandra 
Hernandez. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've lived in the 77th area for the last 20-something years, and I've lived in 
the same house for the last seven years. People on my street know I'm a police 
officer, and as long as I'm not a police officer who goes crazy and shoots in 
my back yard, I think my neighbors feel better because of me. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it makes a difference to people that I'm from the area because I hear 
too often, "Well, you don't know what it's like to live here." But I know, so 
you can't tell me, "I have to go out and sell drugs" or "I have to go out and 
do this or that." That's not true. I'm not doing it and I'm in the same 
situation you are in. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody is comfortable working in the area they grew up in, or 
around their friends, or in the area where their kids live. I can understand 
that. The only thing I think most officers worry about is their families. 
</P>
<P>
 To have a suspect know that your family is over there is probably the only 
thing you really worry about. Having someone in a position where they can 
bother your family, well, that's the thing that gets most people. I feel a 
little different because, while my street is not quiet every night, and I've 
seen my fellow officers come out and do raids and I've had shootings on my 
streets, I've also seen that in Beverly Hills and in Fontana. There is no place 
I know of where I can go and feel 100% safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, living here has been a positive in that I have a lot of street 
knowledge, and that means knowing body language; it's figuring out what a 
suspect might do by remembering what you might do when you were in the same 
kind of situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy can't teach you everything about how to survive on the streets or 
how to talk or approach people in a manner that won't make them feel belittled 
or intimidated. It's something you have to have, an ability to talk to people. 
If they don't feel comfortable around you or feel like they can't trust you, 
then you won't be getting any information from them. 
</P>
<P>
 In this area, the 77th, I see a lot of people daily who I remember from 
growing up. I remember what kind of people they were then and what tendencies 
they had. They may not be the same way now, but I know what to look for. So if 
they were a mental patient with violent tendencies, then I have the advantage 
of knowing maybe this is someone I just can't walk up on. Whereas an officer 
who doesn't know him or never met him won't have the same advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to move at one time 70 miles away. I started thinking to myself that 
means I'll have to drive 70 miles every day, and I'm getting one more bedroom 
for twice as much money. For me, it wasn't worth it to move. 
</P>
<P>
 When I think about it, I live in a place where I get a breeze from the ocean. 
I can be at work on my bike in 20 minutes and no one can give extra patrol to 
my house better than I can. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember once my dog was scratching on the back door and my wife was at home 
with our baby son. And I was working and she called because she thought there 
was a burglar. I had 11 police officers in my back yard before I could get to 
my house, and the call came out Code 3, possible burglary in progress. The poor 
dog was the only thing in the yard, but there were 11 police officers in 20 or 
30 seconds. Where else can I get that kind of response? 
</P>
<P>
 I've spoken to a few fellow officers who want to move back into the area 
because they are tired of commuting or tired of seeing the area they lived in 
change and become occupied by the bad element of some other part of Los Angeles 
where the prices of homes are lower. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be the first one out in a new tract home, but who is going to move in 
around you? It may be the person you put away just yesterday for rape or 
robbery who is also trying to get away from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not trying to get away from Los Angeles. I'm trying to make it the nicest 
place I've ever lived in. And the place where I live now is the nicest place 
I've ever lived. It's not perfect, but I don't think you will ever find the 
perfect place. 
</P>
<P>
 I like Los Angeles and being able to get on any freeway in five minutes. I 
live close to the Sports Arena and the Forum. I live near major shopping areas, 
the beach. I stay because everything is here. Living way out there with all the 
loud crickets would kind of give me rattled nerves.

VOICES: A NEW WAY OF CUTTING UP THE PIE; SKILLED MANAGEMENT WILL BE NEEDED TO 
MITIGATE POTENTIAL CONFLICT AS MEXICANS AND OTHER LATIN AMERICANS CHALLENGE 
AFRICAN AMERICANS AT THE VOTING BOOTH

<P>
 Latino leaders are coming around to an unprecedented interest in promoting 
citizenship. They have seen that a lot of gains have been made. For example, in 
1992, Latinos from Los Angeles County went from three members of the Assembly 
to six, and we had an extra person elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a recognition that gains based simply on population growth and 
redistricting have pretty much been accomplished, and what's really lacking now 
is getting more voters out of the people who are already here. 
</P>
<P>
 So there is a drive among the Latino leadership to encourage citizenship. Lots 
of organizations now are really promoting this. The Clinton Administration is 
actually budgeting $30 million for the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
to promote citizenship acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential is extraordinary for a dramatic increase in the numbers of 
Latino voters. And that will have consequences. There's no question that this 
will lead to the election of more Latinos and this will mean replacing, in 
certain electoral districts, elected officials who are not Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 This is going to affect African American political officeholders. Electoral 
districts that form a good deal of the base of African American political power 
have seen substantial population change due to two things. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the influx of Latin American, Mexican and Central American immigrants. 
The other almost simultaneous factor is the out-migration by middle-class, 
upwardly mobile African-Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 This will probably mean a decline of African American office-holding in the 
city and the county of Los Angeles over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say there are not new avenues for African American politics, 
but it will be in other areas, such as the suburban and more middle-class areas 
African Americans have moved to. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that needs to be dealt with, with real political skill and 
honesty and commitment, is the likely competition between two distinct groups, 
both of whom are still struggling to define their place in American society. 
The competition could aggravate already tense relations between Latinos and 
African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's really incumbent on the broader metropolitan community to approach this 
with open eyes and to confront the delicacy of managing that competition and 
recognize that it is real. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-immigrant attitudes among African Americans, racist attitudes among 
Latinos -- those are real factors. And they require skilled management to 
contain the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 It's incumbent on the leaders of every community to confront bigotry when it 
manifests itself. And I think we've had notable failures to do that up to now. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had failures within the African American community to recognize and to 
confront and to suppress instances of bigotry toward Latinos -- Mexicans in 
particular. We've had in the Latino community a failure by elected officials to 
recognize when certain self-styled leaders make inflammatory statements or take 
a demagogic and racially provocative approach to Latino-black relations. And I 
think we've seen a failure in the established Anglo leadership to recognize 
this bigotry for what it is and to confront it as well.  
</P>
<P>
 A number of things have got to be made clear.  
</P>
<P>
 One is that as you bring in and represent groups that have lacked 
representation before, it is not to the exclusion of other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 African American politicians have got to recognize that their districts are 
changing and they may be, in several instances, the last African American to 
serve in that position.  
</P>
<P>
 They've got to recognize that they need to serve their entire constituency, 
everyone who lives in their district. That means their staff must reflect that 
and the issues they take up have got to reflect that. 
</P>
<P>
 It requires leadership on all sides.

 Softball rivalry shifted into high gear Thursday as Garfield beat Roosevelt, 
1-0, in a Southeastern Conference game that ended with a double-play at home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt, which threatened in the bottom of the sixth, did so again in the 
last play of the game. With the bases loaded, Garfield short stop Angela 
Cardenas threw the ball to first baseman Yolie Duran for the second out on a 
short grounder. Immediately Duran made a perfect throw to catcher Jennifer 
Inzunza who tagged Blanca Gonzalez in a collision as she was going in for the 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs remain undefeated, 5-0, in conference play while Roosevelt fell 
to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the top of the fifth, pitcher Alma Limon connected on a solid 
single for the Bulldogs. Left fielder Sonia Gutierrez followed with a single to 
left field. Then Vanessa Cardona delivered a single up the middle to bring in 
Limon for the only score. 
</P>
<P>
 Those singles were the only hits Roughrider Liz Ballesteros allowed. Arguably 
the City's best pitcher, Ballesteros lost her first game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took advantage of their one chance and they scored," said Roosevelt 
Coach Robert Drake. "We had several opportunities to score. We just didn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Roughrider catcher Michele Tiger was the only multiple hitter, hitting two 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield 3, Bell 1 -- Limon threw a three-hitter and Alex Abundiz hit a triple 
that brought in the go-ahead run and the cushion point for the hosting Bulldogs 
in an Eastern League game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate 15, Fremont 6 -- Senior Edith Martinez went three-for-four, 
including a double and triple and three RBIs in the Pathfinders' Southeastern 
Conference loss Thursday. Fremont sophomore second baseman Adrianne Barnes made 
an unassisted double play in the fourth. VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt 3, Jefferson 1 -- After breezing through the first two games by 
capitalizing on Democrat errors, the unbeaten Roughriders (5-0, 1-0) got sloppy 
and dropped the third game before trampling their guests in an Eastern League 
victory, 15-7, 15-2, 5-15, 15-4.  
</P>

TRACK; CAL STATE L.A. WOMEN EDGE RIVAL CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Los Angeles women edged rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 91-90, 
to place second in the recent Mustang Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won the meet with 173 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outcome of the seven-team meet did little to ease Cal State L.A. Coach 
Greg Ryan's concerns about what will happen when the same two rivals meet at 
the California College Athletic Assn. championships in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a chess match," Ryan said. "We're trying to guess who (Cal Poly) is 
going to put in what event, and they're trying to figure out what we're going 
to do. We don't want to let them go uncontested in any event. We need to go 
head to head with them as much as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy has paid dividends for Cal State L.A. the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Golden Eagles held off Cal Poly, 202-197, to end the Mustangs' 
11-year title reign. Cal State L.A. beat them again last year, 184 1/2-172, to 
win its second consecutive CCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Hill, the defending NCAA Division II champion in the shotput and discus, 
will be prominent in the Golden Eagles' bid for a third title. The senior won 
the shotput and discus with marks of 45-9 3/4 and 174-3 at the Mustang Open. 
Ganet Gorgis, Oshonda Posey and Marisol Pedraza also attained provisional 
qualifying marks for the Division II championships at the April 2 meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorgis won the 3,000 meters in 9 minutes 51.12 seconds and Posey placed second 
in the 100 meters in 11.96. Pedraza was third in the 1,500 meters in 4:37.81 in 
a race won by 1992 U.S. Olympian PattiSue Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Smith and William McCoy paced Cal State L.A. to a fourth-place finish 
among eight men's teams. Stanford won with 160 points, followed by Brigham 
Young and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with 128 1/2 and 126 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the 1989 state high school 200-meter champion, won the 100 in 10.54 and 
was second in the 200 in 21.61. McCoy leaped 24-1 to win the long jump and 
bounded 48-9 to finish fifth in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and McCoy also combined with John Hensley and Ruben Benitez on the 
Golden Eagles' victorious 400 relay (41.39). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A four-year unbeaten streak that spanned 21 meets ended Thursday for the Bell 
Gardens' boys' team as they lost 86-49 to Schurr in an Almont League meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Granville (10.2), Siro Ochoa (2:07.9) and Eduardo Diaz (10:24.6) 
recorded victories in the 100 yards, 880 and two miles for the host Lancers 
(0-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Murrillo won the 800 in 2:33.3 and led a Bell Gardens sweep in the 
mile, clocking 6:07.3, to lead the Lancer girls to a 86-39 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon LanYuen won the shotput with a heave of 35-5 for Bell Gardens (2-0). 
Sisters Sandra (100-3) and Kristina Paulo (12.8) won the discus and 100 yards.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; SOUTH GATE BURIES JORDAN -- WITH HELP FROM THE 'DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard for a team to get respect when it plays in the same conference as 
Huntington Park, Roosevelt and South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Coach Ray Duron knows the only way his Bulldogs will gain recognition 
is by defeating one of the Big Three: "Everyone sees playing Jordan as an easy 
game.The only way we can change that is to beat the top teams in our 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Duron and Jordan's quest will have to wait, losing to South 
Gate, 9-1, last week in a Southeastern Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 And before the Bulldogs can beat the elite, they will first have to learn how 
not to beat themselves. Mario Guillen and Arthur Valera both had singles taken 
away by the umpire in the third and fourth innings, respectively, after being 
called out for throwing their bats. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistakes helped South Gate pitcher George Zamora (1-0) cruise to a two-hit 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thrown bats and misjudged fly balls and we can't make those types of 
mental mistakes and expect to win," Duron said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate, playing its fifth game in four days, used a makeshift lineup to 
rest players. Their starting first baseman and clean-up hitter, Jesse Torres, 
sat out the game sick.  
</P>
<P>
 A break for Jordan pitcher Ernesto Jimenez (0-1)? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' replacement, Ernesto Barron, didn't play like anyone's backup, going 
two-for-two with three RBIs. Barron opened South Gate's scoring in the second 
inning with an RBI triple to centerfield and helped the Rams pad their lead, 
7-0, in the fifth with a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's Frank Medina drove in Oscar Coracero from second on a two-out single 
in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in typical Bulldog performance on this day, Medina was thrown out at 
second trying to stretch the single into a double.

 South Gate 2, Fremont 0 -- Pitcher David Coria threw a three-hitter, striking 
out one, as South Gate squeaked by Fremont in a Southeastern Conference game 
Tuesday at South Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams scored one run in the fourth on Damon Mojarro's sacrifice fly and one 
in the fifth on Edgar Marquez's run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont had the bases loaded with one out in the fifth, but Ernie Sandoval 
grounded into a double play to end the threat.  
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval gave up only one earned run on five hits and three walks. He struck 
out three. ROY JURGENS

 San Pedro 4, Dorsey 1 -- Charles Thompson's errant throw to third in the 
bottom of the fifth allowed the go-ahead run Thursday as the Dons lost a 
Southern Pacific game at San Pedro. Dorsey pitcher William Dillard flirted with 
a no-hitter until Pirate catcher Gary Sloan hit a solo home run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 University 14, Manual Arts 6 -- Manual Arts' Paul Gordon hit a two-run home 
run and Azizi Tharpes added a solo shot, but it wasn't enough as the Toilers 
lost to University in a Coastal Conference game Tuesday at Harvard Park. 
</P>
<P>
 University did not have trouble scoring off starting pitcher Jesus Rosales, 
who went the distance despite giving up 14 runs on 17 hits, three walks and one 
hit batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 7-0 in the second, Manual Arts got on the scoreboard when third 
baseman Juan Sandoval walked and scored on Gordon's blast to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 With University leading 8-2, Manual Arts' Joey Villegas singled, moved to 
second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored from second on a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts scored two unearned runs in the fourth, and scored another run in 
the sixth in Tharpes' home run. TONY JONES

SCOTT HARRIS: EARTHQUAKE SET HER POETRY IN MOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Men seldom make passes  
</P>
<P>
 At girls who wear glasses.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Dorothy Parker 
</P>
<P>
 (1893-1967) 
</P>
<P>
 Me thinks there is no bigger cheater  
</P>
<P>
 Than the guy who fixed my water heater . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Geraldine Forer Spagnoli (year of birth unknown) 
</P>
<P>
 And to think: Not long ago, Geri Spagnoli, the poet, thought of herself as the 
underachiever in the family. After all, one daughter is an attorney; the other 
is an artist who sculpted E.T. for Steven Spielberg. And as for her sister 
June, well. . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Mel Blanc was the Laurence Olivier of voice-over artists, then June Foray 
is the Katharine Hepburn. She was the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel, the KGB spy 
Natasha, Witch Hazel and countless commercials. June has such talent she once 
made manure seem sexy, purring: "Remember: Bandini is the word for fertilizer." 
</P>
<P>
 Geri Forer Spagnoli never had the need to change Forer to Foray. Oh, Geri did 
a few live TV commercials herself back in the early '60s. To the show biz 
crowd, Geri was June's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what do you do?" June's friends would ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gets married," June would crack of thrice-wed Geri. 
</P>
<P>
 So now that she's "in her 60s" and her latest marriage, to Sam Spagnoli, has 
lasted 21 years, it must be sweet that Geri may introduce herself as a 
published poet. Now, it may be true that Geri's book is self-published, or 
rather Sam-published, since it was he who assembled the work on home computer. 
But to read "In the Wake of the Quake" is to be reminded of the whimsy of Ogden 
Nash and Richard Armour. 
</P>
<P>
 A bonus are the doodles of Brian Cole, Geri's son-in-law. With a couplet about 
a water-heater cheater, for example, comes a cartoon of the repairman offering 
his estimate. "$$$$$$$," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Geri, who lives in Calabasas, sent me a copy of her book a few weeks ago, and 
after one glance, I dubiously put it aside. My experience with unpublished 
poets and philosophers has not always been positive. Once in a college English 
course, a Socrates-on-a-surfboard graced me with a self-published pamphlet of 
his deep musings. An example: "Ignorance is bliss. No s---. It really is." That 
I remember this is, I think, a tribute to something other than its profundity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So Geri's slim volume soon became buried under the daily chaos of faxes, 
newspapers and more mail. When I did my monthly desk cleaning, I felt like Jed 
Clampett out shootin' for some food, when up from the ground come a bubblin' 
crude. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse, that is. Light verse. Not Texas tea. Poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Geri's verse is more refined than crude. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake did intrude  
</P>
<P>
 I went to bed quite in the nude  
</P>
<P>
 Now I sleep in sweats instead  
</P>
<P>
 For a hasty exit from my bed.  
</P>
<P>
 Or this: 
</P>
<P>
 Among the experts they debate  
</P>
<P>
 Was it six point six  
</P>
<P>
 Or six point eight  
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes declared it number seven  
</P>
<P>
 To me it felt like an eleven  
</P>
<P>
 In the era of Beavis and Butt-head, light verse is rarer than a clean joke. 
Geri has dabbled in the form as long as she can remember, dedicating rhymes to 
birthdays, anniversaries and other occasions. It wasn't until the memorable 
morning of Jan. 17, she says, that the words really started to pour forth. The 
earthquake was her muse. As Geri observes: 
</P>
<P>
 It ' s strange that consequences dire  
</P>
<P>
 My creativity does inspire  
</P>
<P>
 She would fax her ditties to Brian, who would then fax back a corresponding 
cartoon. Geri's extended clan had its share of earthquake trouble, but nothing 
serious enough to keep them from grinning through the adversity. When Geri 
shared her poems and Brian's illustrations with friends, they urged her to 
publish. This was no problem; after all, Sam and Geri had owned a printing 
business before selling it last year to spend more time riding around on Sam's 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 They printed a couple thousand copies. "Sam went crazy," Geri explains. Only 
three weeks after the quake, they were done, setting a price of $3.50. It costs 
to self-publish, after all. Friends would buy several copies to share with 
other friends. At a beauty salon, one of Geri's friends showed it to a woman in 
the advertising racket, who promptly requested several copies. Geri's sister 
June gave copies to friends, including some who sit with her on the Board of 
Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, June received a thank you note. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear June,  
</P>
<P>
 A necessarily hasty note while I've got a few minutes during a taping.  
</P>
<P>
 I loved "In the Wake of the Quake!" As did my bride, Felicia . . . Walter is 
off limning "Einstein" in Princeton and I'll forward it to him in a day or so.  
</P>
<P>
 Your sister's terrific and so are you . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Love, Jack  
</P>
<P>
 Fan mail from some flounder? No. That's Jack as in Lemmon and Walter as in 
Matthau, whose home was devastated in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Geri may not be on the best-seller list, but a few hundred copies are floating 
around now, inspiring chuckles of recognition. Her wisecracking sister now 
brags about Geri. "She arrived at writing a little bit late," June says. "But 
it's never too late." 
</P>
<P>
 This critic has but one complaint. Fifteen poems and 15 cartoons aren't quite 
enough. A paucity of choices should make it easy to pick a favorite, but it 
doesn't, and I only have room to share one more. With the end so near, Geri's 
own finale seems appropriate, an ode to the way . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Quake has brought out the best in us  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor helping neighbor, in God we trust  
</P>
<P>
 So much kindness and all this good feeling  
</P>
<P>
 Had warmed up my heart and sent my head reeling  
</P>
<P>
 I said "People are nice" as I got on the freeway  
</P>
<P>
 I moved over a lane to give a guy leeway  
</P>
<P>
 My faith was restored  
</P>
<P>
 No more would I scoff  
</P>
<P>
 When he gave me the finger  
</P>
<P>
 And cut me right off.

PARENTS SPLIT ON UNIFORMS FOR STUDENTS; SURVEY: ONE HUNDRED VENTURA RESPONDENTS 
EITHER STRONGLY BACK THE CONCEPT FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OR REJECT IT AS AN 
ATTACK ON INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. 
</P>

 Parents at Ventura's 17 elementary schools are split sharply over whether 
their children should wear uniforms to school, a prospect raised by Supt. 
Joseph Spirito last week, a Times survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred parents, interviewed at Ventura Unified School District's 
elementary campuses, either strongly supported uniforms as a timely 
back-to-basics tool or rejected them as an infringement on individual liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six parents favored uniforms because they would blur the distinction 
between rich and poor students, cut clothing costs, enhance discipline and send 
out a message that children go to school to learn, not to strut designer 
fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea," said Pam Kottler, mother of a Pierpont School 
second-grader. "It's like you dress one way for work and you dress another way 
for play." 
</P>
<P>
 But 44 parents -- especially those at Junipero Serra and Juanamaria schools -- 
said uniforms promote conformity for no good reason, since gang-related dress 
is only a safety problem at middle and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's communist," said John Godinez as he dropped off his daughter at 
Montalvo School Friday morning. "What's wrong with the way kids dress now? This 
is a public school, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito, an avid backer of student uniforms, revealed last week that he had 
taken his plan to create one "back-to-basics" elementary school a step further, 
and will ask that every elementary school principal soon poll parents to 
measure their feelings on uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing from parents is, 'Why can't my neighborhood school have 
that?' " Spirito said. "I'm saying, "Go ahead. You can if you get a consensus.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 If at least 75% of parents from a school vote for uniforms, then Spirito said 
the district would seriously consider the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at each school could also decide to implement one or all of the other 
key elements of the district's back-to-basics program, Spirito said. Those are 
strict discipline, a curriculum that emphasizes traditional teaching methods 
and a requirement that parents spend time helping at school. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a strict uniform dress code is successful on the elementary level, 
Spirito said he would support it at middle schools as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it to start at the bottom and work its way up," he said. "If a parent 
says yes to a uniform for a third-grader, I think that parent will say yes in 
middle school." 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito's announcement last week came as more public schools throughout the 
state and nation consider requiring student uniforms as a way to cut violence 
linked to youth gang dress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Unified School District, which has a far more serious gang 
problem than the Ventura district, recently became the first in the state to 
require all elementary and junior high students to wear uniforms, beginning 
next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Long Beach's new policy would withstand legal challenge is not clear. 
Some school districts say such a strict dress code might violate a state law 
that reaffirms students' freedom of speech and rights under the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 A legislative bill that explicitly allows districts to mandate student 
uniforms passed the state Senate Education Committee Thursday on a 5-0 vote. 
The bill would require districts to purchase uniforms for students who could 
not afford them. Spirito said no Ventura parents would be forced to buy 
uniforms even if their children attend schools that adopts them as a general 
policy. He said transfers to a school without uniforms could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, school dress policies rely on the state education code, which under a 
1993 amendment allows the banning of gang apparel but does not specifically 
mention uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's interest in student uniforms, Spirito said, is part of the 
district's response to last fall's school voucher ballot initiative. It 
threatened to shift state money to private schools if parents decided to leave 
the public system. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we heard then was, 'We've lost confidence in you. We have no power. We 
have no voice,' " Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering to open up the system to more basic schools helps answer that 
complaint, he said. And most of the parents interviewed by The Times said they 
would like to take Spirito up on his offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents said they were not much concerned about gang dress in their 
schools. But some backed uniforms in elementary schools as necessary if strict 
dress policies are to be imposed where they are really needed -- at the middle 
and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents said uniforms are a partial response to unwanted societal 
influences over their children. 
</P>
<P>
 And they said uniforms would help eliminate snobbishness about clothes among 
rich and poor students, while curbing arguments between parents and children 
over expensive clothes and what to wear to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are truly mean to each other, and uniforms would free them from worrying 
about what they're wearing," said Karen Dice, whose daughter attends Will 
Rogers School. "It's a chance for the kids to be equal." Irene Bachmann said 
her son, a kindergartner at Elmhurst School, already has acquired a consumer's 
attitude about dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "He already knows how to pick out a $180 Bulls' jacket," she said. "He likes 
Air Jordan sneakers. He knows the difference from K mart sneakers. . . . It's 
out of control, and the uniforms would help." 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents said uniforms would help create a disciplined atmosphere at 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids in school are getting horrible, the way they behave, the 
disrespect," said Wendy Christy, a parent with children at both Oak View and 
Arnaz elementary schools. "The boys are wearing those real baggy shorts that 
hang down to their butts with their boxers showing." 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents who attended parochial school themselves said they appreciated 
having uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel proud and important," said Rosa de la Rosa, a parent at 
Saticoy School. "It showed that I belonged, that I was in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of school uniforms focused primarily on issues of conformity, 
individuality, creativity and choice -- positions similar to that taken by the 
American Civil Liberties Union in opposing the pending school uniform bill in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like my kids to be able to express their individuality and wear what they 
want to wear," said Lea Nussman, a parent of a fifth-grader at Juanamaria and a 
seventh-grader at Cabrillo Middle School. "They have two really nice Raiders' 
jackets, and they've chosen not to wear them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Henkel, a parent and teaching assistant at Mound School, said requiring 
uniforms would run counter to parents' efforts to teach children to be 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to teach our children to be individual and to think for 
themselves," Henkel said. "I think with the right guidance by parents and 
teachers, children will make the right choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents said uniforms address a safety problem that generally does not 
exist in Ventura's elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And a number of parents, especially poorer ones, said they were concerned that 
school uniforms would cost far more than the clothes their children now wear -- 
some purchased from thrift stores or hand-me-downs from older siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some affluent parents saw the uniforms as an added cost, since their 
children would still want nice casual clothes for non-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, students tended to agree with their parents -- and several said 
they would not object to uniforms so long as they were not ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have to think about what to wear every day. It would make my life 
a little easier," said Mike Dobson, 9, of Loma Vista School. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sara Hummer, a Pierpont fifth-grader, said, "Uniforms are better, because 
nobody can make fun of the way you dress. But some people might not like 
dresses. Some people -- like me -- just aren't dress persons." 
</P>
<P>
 Sara's friend Lacey Sikes said a uniform would be OK if the color was right. 
And another, Raichel Carbon, added: "We could wear overalls." They all agreed 
that was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elizabeth Aguillar, a third-grader at E. P. Foster School, said she likes 
to wear her own style of clothes. "I don't like wearing the same clothes as my 
friends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Will Rogers School's Tiffany Tyburski, 10, said, "I'd feel embarrassed in 
case a cute boy comes by." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents said their children would rebel against uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be nice," said Liz Gourley, mother of two Poinsettia School 
students. "But my kids would hate it." Views on Uniforms Vary 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking response to the Ventura Unified School District's move toward 
requiring student uniforms at some schools, The Times gathered the opinions of 
102 parents -- at least five from each of the 17 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six parents favored uniforms, 44 opposed them and two were neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents were interviewed last week as they dropped off their children at 
school or picked them up. This is a sampler of what they had to say. WESTERN 
VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 E. P. FOSTER: Six parents, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "These little kids have too much freedom. They need more structure in their 
lives. Elementary school might be a good place to start," said Eleanor 
Arellanes, mother of a kindergartner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sue Larimore said that her two children would hate the uniforms. "They 
like to wear what they want to wear, and I think I'd go along with them." 
</P>
<P>
 SHERIDAN WAY: Five parents, 3 oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it stinks. I think it will place an undue economic hardship on 
parents and take away kids' individual rights," said James Pike, father of a 
first-grade boy. "I think part of growing up is deciding what clothes you'll 
wear to school." 
</P>
<P>
 But Doreen Kennedy, whose son is in the second grade, said, "It would bring 
all the children together of all economic levels. . . . Nobody would feel like, 
'I have this great outfit on and you have on a set of rags.' " 
</P>
<P>
 ARNAZ: Five parents, 3 oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would be such a bad idea," said Lynn Muise, who has a 
daughter in second grade and a son in kindergarten. "That way the kids (who) 
can't afford the nicer, brand-name clothes won't be singled out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jay Paddock, mother of a kindergarten girl, said, "Who's going to pay for 
it? And I just don't see any reason for it. Where we live is completely 
different than Ventura. We're out in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 OAK VIEW: Five parents, 4 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to start somewhere," said school librarian Debi Carroll, whose two 
daughters attend the school. "Parents aren't making sure their kids dress 
properly when they walk out that door." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Landberg, mother of two at Oak View, said, "It might be a good idea to 
have (uniforms) in the upper grades. And I think in order to do that, you'd 
need to start it in elementary school to get them used to it -- where it's not 
such a shock." CENTRAL VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 WILL ROGERS: Ten parents, 6 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to have their $60 jeans and their $70 tennis shoes, when there 
are kids who can't afford that," said Tami Ulizio, whose children are in third 
and sixth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 But Casey Stafford, whose daughter attends Will Rogers, said, "I would support 
it if they could show it stops violence and gang activity, but I don't see that 
as a problem at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 PIERPONT: Ten parents; 5 in favor, 1 neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," said Gina Rylander, mother of four. "It would cut down on my 
height-of-fashion daughter. She's 8." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzie Hummer, mother of a fifth-grader, said, "I'd be all for it, but I don't 
think they could approve it. There are too many parents who don't want their 
kids' rights violated." 
</P>
<P>
 LINCOLN: Five parents, 3 opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have little girls who are going to want to wear their ballerina 
clothes and little boys who want to wear their Dodger shirts," said Neel 
DeBone, who has two sons at Lincoln. "They're a little young to impose 
sanctions of that sort. You have to let them be kids at some point." 
</P>
<P>
 But Margaret Martinez, whose sons are 10 and 5, said uniforms would "make the 
focus more on how they're doing in school, rather than how they're looking at 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 LOMA VISTA:  
</P>
<P>
 Five parents, 3 support. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Haycox, who has two children at Loma Vista, said she wore uniforms through 
the 12th grade. "When I first graduated, I wasn't so hot on them, but now, 
looking back, I think they solved a lot of problems. What clothes your kids are 
wearing shouldn't be one of the things we have to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 But Verlie Howser, mother of two, said, "I don't think that's the answer. If 
safety is the issue, then let's deal with the issues of safety." 
</P>
<P>
 BLANCHE REYNOLDS: Five parents, 3 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it takes away from a kid's creativity," said Matt Hickle, who has a 
daughter, 7, and a son, 9. "If you have a uniform, they don't have the ability 
to express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly believe in uniforms," said Maria Faulkner, whose two grandchildren 
attend Blanche Reynolds. "If they're poor, they won't feel bad, so everybody's 
equal."  
</P>
<P>
 ELMHURST: Five parents, 4 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's cheaper than buying jeans and tennis shoes for the kids, why not?" 
said Santos Rodrigues, father of two young students.  
</P>
<P>
 Toby Petty, whose 6-year-old daughter attends Elmhurst, said, "I think it 
would make our mornings easier. Now I am always arguing with my daughter over 
what she will wear." EAST VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 JUNIPERO SERRA: Six parents; 4 opposed, 1 neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody looking alike?" asked Rodney Campolini, father of two girls, 10 and 
6. "That's not fun when you are a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Lena Hill, mother of a 6-year-old boy, said uniforms would be boring. "I don't 
like the idea of everyone dressing the same. I like to pick my son's clothing 
in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 POINSETTIA: Nine parents, 7 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think making a fashion statement these days can be dangerous," said Kim 
Saracini, mother of four students, including one at Poinsettia and three at 
Anacapa Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Meza, whose son is a Poinsettia first-grader, said, "I think it would 
take away their First Amendment right. I think it's wrong. How you dress is who 
you are." 
</P>
<P>
 JUANAMARIA: Five parents, 4 opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have to wear them when I was little, and I hate them," said Suzette 
Boone, mother of a fifth-grade girl. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sherry Weeks, mother of first- and second-grade girls, added: "I don't 
like being told by someone else what to wear. My daughter wouldn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 MOUND: Five parents, 3 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it takes away from the competitive clothing aspect, the kids' 
one-upmanship that 'I've got to have this because everyone else has it,' " said 
Mary Rivas, who has two sons at Mound. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elaina Fletcher said uniforms are simply not needed at Mound. "The 
children are very well-behaved. I don't see a discipline problem at Mound." 
</P>
<P>
 MONTALVO: Five parents, 3 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like kids coming in looking like little gangbangers. I don't allow my 
sons to dress that way, but I see it, even at the elementary level," said Cathy 
Williams, who has two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Liza Shively, who has a kindergartner, said memories of her dad's military 
career leave her with a sour taste on uniforms and discipline: "I just don't 
like it when they start handing down all these rules." 
</P>
<P>
 PORTOLA: Six parents, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 10-year-old boy who wears only jeans and a T-shirt." said Shell 
Mercurio, parent of a fourth-grader. I think that's part of the freedom of 
being a child." But Anna Muir, who has three elementary-age students, said, "I 
think it would make things a lot easier on working moms. I have three girls and 
every morning I have to figure out what they're going to wear." 
</P>
<P>
 SATICOY: Five parents, 4 support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel like schools are completely safe anymore, and I don't think 
uniforms are going to solve the problem," said Fred Pickering, father of first- 
and second-grade daughters. "But I do think they would add a level of 
discipline and restriction that could be of some help." 
</P>
<P>
 But Corrine Leonardo, whose daughter is in third grade, said, "The school 
seems safe to me. They don't let them wear baseball caps. I think that's strict 
enough."

VALIDITY OF SCHOOL TESTS QUESTIONED; EDUCATION: FEWER OF THE NEW CLAS 
EXAMINATIONS WERE GRADED THAN REQUIRED BY THE STATE'S OWN GUIDELINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS and JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County school officials were shocked to learn that state educators 
scored a far smaller sample of the new student assessment tests than required 
by their own guidelines, calling into question the validity of the results. 
</P>
<P>
 And some officials said they were even more surprised to hear that the 
California Department of Education intentionally scored only a sample of the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm astonished at only 25% being scored," county Supt. of Schools Charles 
Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, about 8,000 students in the fourth, eighth and 10th grades took 
the California Learning Assessment System tests for the first time last spring. 
But only a fraction of the tests they took were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 California education officials maintained that the samples scored would be 
statistically sound, measuring a school's performance in reading, writing and 
math. But the state failed to meet even its own minimum standards on how many 
tests from each school should be scored, a Times computer analysis found. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis found that results in 83% of the schools in Ventura County and 
half of the schools statewide were less precise than promised because too few 
examinations were scored. But the vast majority of the samplings fell short by 
only a few tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county educators said the scoring problems will surely undermine the 
credibility of the revolutionary new assessment test. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't implement their guidelines, it seems to me it would ruin the 
results," Weis said. "It'll jeopardize the effect of the results without a 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other standardized exams that only ask students for the correct answer, 
CLAS assesses how well students write, think and solve problems. Because of the 
tests' complexity, state educators decided to score only a sample of the 
handwritten answers to the first year's exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest scoring problems in Ventura County, as elsewhere in the state, 
were with the tests of fourth graders in elementary schools. For example, of 
the 114 elementary schools in the county that had students take the exams, 73 
had too few reading tests scored to meet the state standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was greater at elementary schools because they tend to be smaller 
than junior highs and high schools. And state guidelines called for scoring all 
tests at small schools, while culling only a sample from larger schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the sampling of tests scored fell slightly short of state 
guidelines. At Anacapa Middle School in Ventura, for example, 331 students took 
math tests and 105 of these were scored, nine less than the state required. 
</P>
<P>
 But at two of the county's schools -- Sequoia Junior High in Simi Valley and 
Flory School in Moorpark -- the shortfall was more significant. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sequoia, 360 eighth-grade students took the CLAS math tests last spring. 
Only 14 -- 3.9% -- of the tests were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the extremely small size of this sample, the state extrapolated from 
the results on those 14 tests to calculate the overall performance of Sequoia's 
eighth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 And the results weren't good. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequoia's math test results were among the worst in the county; the tests 
indicated that 81% of Sequoia's eighth-grade students have only a limited 
understanding of mathematical ideas and rarely use the correct techniques to 
solve math problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley school officials said they suspected something was wrong with 
Sequoia's test results. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked at Sequoia's (scores), I knew automatically we had a problem 
because of the number of kids graded," said Becky Wetzel, testing director for 
the Simi Valley Unified School District. "It stood out like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Wetzel said she called state education officials the day she received the 
scores, then faxed them a letter the following day asking why so few tests were 
scored. She has not yet received a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing because we don't know what the real assessment looks like 
for that school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Flory School in Moorpark, 215 fourth-grade students took the tests. But 
only 52, or 24%, of their reading tests were scored. That made Flory one of 
only 148 schools in the state that had less than the required minimum 25% of 
its tests scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark school board member Clint Harper said he wanted to examine the Flory 
CLAS results more closely before saying whether the scoring problem made a 
significant difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Harper said, the state should have scored all of the tests at every 
school. "Ideally, as a board member, I'd like to see all the tests scored." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have promised on future CLAS tests to score a higher number of 
papers than were read in the first year of the exam. The next round of CLAS 
tests will be given this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper and other school officials said they view the scoring problems on the 
first round of tests as a simple glitch that can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test was being tested probably as much as the schools and the students 
were," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetzel agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you throw the whole thing out because you question it," she 
said. "I think you question it, revise it and try to make it better the next 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Weis said that he believes the scoring problems prove that the state has 
taken on more than it can handle with the CLAS exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of the test is outstanding," Weis said. But, he said, "When you 
get something as large as the state of California dealing with this, there can 
be huge logistical problems. It's such a huge undertaking, I don't think we 
have the resources to do it right."

SUPERIOR COURT RACE PITS A PAIR OF OPPOSITES; CAMPAIGN: PROSECUTOR COLLEEN TOY 
WHITE AND CRIMINAL LAWYER JAMES FARLEY MAY BE ALIKE IN ONLY ONE WAY: THEY BOTH 
WANT SEAT ON THE BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colleen Toy White is a career prosecutor and outspoken advocate of victims' 
rights. As Ventura County's chief assistant district attorney, she also helps 
decide who faces the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 James Matthew Farley is a veteran criminal attorney and passionate guardian of 
defendants' rights. As one of the county's most notable defense lawyers, he has 
defended numerous murder suspects, including one facing capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many elections -- in which candidates appear more alike than different 
-- the June 7 race for the county's only contested judicial vacancy pits a pair 
of legal opposites. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are two people who hold different beliefs, who bring different 
qualifications to the job," observed Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy, who 
backs Farley, his longtime confidante. "It seems to me that the public has to 
decide which qualifications they want." 
</P>
<P>
 White and Farley can't even agree on what the public is looking for in a 
judge.  
</P>
<P>
 Farley says a judge should be someone who understands how a trial court 
operates, who is aware of the various maneuvers and who knows the pressures 
trial attorneys face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Toy has that capability, and that's the issue in the race," 
said Farley, 59. "She's proven herself to be a capable administrator and, 
hopefully, she'll continue doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said White is not qualified to sit on the lower Municipal Court, let alone 
fill the vacancy on the Superior Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
 White agreed that the public wants a judge who is competent and who knows the 
law. But she also said it wants a judge who truly understands the fear of 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me, 'Do you believe in the death penalty? What do you think of 
these gangs?' I think people are ready to hold the people who have authority in 
their lives accountable," the 49-year-old prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to know, do I get it? Do I understand they are afraid to walk the 
streets at night? Do I understand they are afraid to send their kids to 
school?" 
</P>
<P>
 White has received endorsements so far from the Ventura County Deputy 
Sheriff's Assn. and police chiefs from Ventura, Oxnard, Santa Paula, Simi 
Valley and Port Hueneme. She is also supported by Superior Court Judges Ken 
Riley, Charles W. Campbell and Barbara Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley's endorsements include the Service Employees International Union Local 
998, the Mexican-American Political Forum of Ventura County and Superior Court 
Judges Lawrence Storch, William Peck and James McNally. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Todd R. Howeth said Farley is the best candidate 
"because he is a man of impeccable moral authority." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has more trial experience probably than anybody in Ventura County," Howeth 
added. "I can't think of anybody who would be a better candidate for a Superior 
Court judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he learned that Farley would make the race, Hardy had compared running 
against White to running against Mother Teresa. But Hardy is now 
enthusiastically supporting Farley. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always there for anybody who needs him," Hardy said. "Whether it's a 
cop, district attorney, defense lawyer, crook, judge or anybody else. I'm not 
ashamed to admit that I love the man." 
</P>
<P>
 White's supporters see things differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim comes with less quality experience to be a judge than Toy White," said 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, honorary chairman of White's campaign. "As an 
example, prosecutors make quasi-judicial decisions day in and day out on civil 
and criminal cases. Experience as a prosecutor probably is the best experience 
for a position on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the race a classic matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a candidate who has spent her career putting crooks in jail," 
Bradbury said. "On the other hand, you've got a defense attorney who has spent 
his career trying to keep crooks out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Campbell, a White supporter, said the fact that White has been an 
administrator and out of the courtroom for more than 11 years is not 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very small part of what a judge has to do," Campbell said. "Her 
opponent has a lot more jury trial experience, but you can quickly pick up how 
to handle a trial. I think what's more important is the person underneath." 
</P>
<P>
 White has been in the district attorney's office for 17 years, rising from law 
clerk to second-in-command. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've really spent my career trying to put people in jail," White said. "If 
the public is convinced you know the law, you're honest and you're not going to 
be afraid to make the tough decisions, then you're qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 She credited her drive to protect victims' rights to her upbringing. Raised in 
Wetumka, Okla., a town of about 1,000, White -- who picked up the nickname Toy 
as an infant -- said she grew up without much in terms of material possessions. 
She learned to deal with adversity, she said, and relates that to the problems 
crime victims endure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many girls in her town married as teen-agers, and White was no exception, 
tying the knot at age 16 while a high-school junior. By 1968, she had two 
children (a third was killed as an infant in an auto crash), a struggling 
marriage and no diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 After obtaining a high-school equivalency diploma at age 24, White earned an 
associate's degree before enrolling in the Ventura College of Law at 28 -- an 
age when most lawyers have several years of practice already under their belts. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time White took the state bar exam, she was a single mother of two with 
$800 in her pocket and the rent overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 She passed and was promoted from the law-clerk job to deputy prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 She soon formed the office's Consumer Mediation Unit, along with now-Municipal 
Judge Barry Klopfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when a con man was about to trick an elderly Fillmore couple out of 
$6,000 to research an alleged cure for cancer, White got into her car and met 
the man at the victims' goat farm. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived at the ramshackle house and stepped from her car, the heels of her 
boots mired in goat droppings. The couple, who had lost a daughter to cancer, 
had already handed the man the check. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even knowing for sure that she had a legal right to intervene, White, by 
rattling off a business and professional code, persuaded the man that he was 
breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just buffaloed him into giving me that check back, and then I literally 
ordered him out of town," she recalled. "You know, like you would see in some B 
movie, 'Get out of this town and don't come back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She said the man was later convicted in Los Angeles County for another scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, Bradbury asked her to be his chief assistant, although 
there were others with more experience who wanted the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she often goes to schools across the county to share with students the 
story of her rise from poor farm girl to a top county prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 The students at first are skeptical of taking advice from her, she said. But 
their jaws drop, eyes water and minds open up when they learn of the path she 
had to take to get where she is. 
</P>
<P>
 After a newspaper profiled White several years ago, a local woman who had been 
thinking of going to law school clipped the article and put it on her 
refrigerator. Then the woman enrolled in Ventura College of Law, glancing at 
the news clipping every day for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman recently graduated and capped her experience off with a call to 
White, her role model. "The message is, if Toy White can make it, I can make 
it," White said, recalling the story. 
</P>
<P>
 White believes she would be able to have an even bigger impact on people and 
the law as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a judge and really being involved in the day-to-day operation gives you 
a chance to make a difference on a different level," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As chief assistant, I've been making quasi-judicial decisions over some of 
the most important cases that the office has filed in the past 11 years," White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently oversaw an investigation that led to the county's largest ever 
civil settlement. AT&T agreed to pay the district attorney's office $1.25 
million after prosecutors accused the telecommunications giant of allowing its 
authorized dealers to use illegal tactics to sell home-security systems to the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "She personally spearheaded that and is the person we can thank for grinding 
out an extraordinary settlement for this county," said Bradbury. He also said 
that despite Farley's criticisms, White excelled as a trial attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juries used to love her," Bradbury said. "I would be comfortable sending Toy 
White in tomorrow to try a death-penalty case." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley has been a local defense attorney for 24 years. He ties many of the 
principles that guide his life to the Roman Catholic church, which he serves as 
a deacon. His position allows him to celebrate Holy Communion, marry, bury, 
proclaim the gospel and assist at Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 His church roots go back to his religious upbringing in Albany, N.Y. He came 
to Los Angeles in 1961 to study law and, after considering an acting career, 
thought about becoming a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I toyed with the idea for a while," he said. But he got married instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley became a church official anyway when the Vatican permitted married men 
to become deacons in the early 1970s. He spent two years studying theology and 
other subjects before being ordained. 
</P>
<P>
 As an attorney, Farley serves as one of the county's few "defenders of the 
bond" for the Marriage Tribunal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. In 
about 60 cases a year, he argues on behalf of the church against annulling 
marriages. Instead of a prosecutor, he faces a procurator advocate, or the 
lawyer who argues for annulment. A judge in the church court decides the final 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said he is against annulment in all but the most clear-cut cases in 
which "there was never a marriage in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 An example would be a 16-year-old girl who marries at the behest of her 
parents because she is pregnant or a person who married while psychologically 
ill or chemically dependent. He takes a harder approach toward people who 
simply want to break up after a decade or more of being man and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley received his law degree from Southwestern University in 1966 and was 
admitted to the California Bar a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, he was looking for a change from the big-city pace. Then, while 
trying a case in Ventura County, he encountered then-Public Defender Richard 
Erwin. Erwin liked Farley's style and offered him a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said he accepted without so much as a second thought. "I wanted to get 
out of Los Angeles desperately," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually went into private practice and helped found Criminal Defense 
Associates, a group of lawyers appointed by the court to defend the poor when 
the public defender's office has a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 CDA is where Farley picks up many of his high-profile clients. Many admirers 
point to the case of 16-year-old Gilbert Martinez when they talk about Farley's 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors accused Martinez of being the triggerman in the 1992 shooting 
death of Port Hueneme landlord Richard Schell. 
</P>
<P>
 Three accomplices who were not accused of actually firing the shots that 
killed Schell were convicted of murder. But Martinez, with Farley arguing on 
his behalf, was acquitted of murder in favor of a conviction on the lesser 
charge of attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley, however, said he does not coddle criminals. He said that he would 
"slam" defendants who were convicted in his court of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like violence," he said, adding that he could issue a death sentence 
if the evidence supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said the publicity he receives from some cases has its downside, 
particularly when it is connected to a case that might have outraged the 
public. "We've gotten some strange calls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parishioners, he conceded, find it contradictory that Farley defends 
suspected criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The individuals who I represent who have been notorious, I can't hate the 
people for what they've done. But I can hate what they did. What I can't 
understand is how people can be Christians and condemn someone for doing what 
Jesus did," he said, meaning Christ defended unpopular causes." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes the judicial campaign does not turn into what he called "one 
of these good-guy, bad-guy things." But he says he believes it will. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I'm not a bad guy, and she's not a good guy. We're two lawyers 
looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect the D.A.'s office, as time goes on, to get more and more desperate 
and to say, 'Jim Farley is a real slime ball,' " Farley predicted. "I've 
already been told by some people in the D.A.'s office I don't have a prayer. 
They're wrong. I have plenty of prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court judges are elected for a six-year term and earn $104,262 a 
year. The nonpartisan election will be held June 7.

ANXIOUS STEPS ARE TAKEN BEFORE THE BIGGEST DANCE; CULTURE: YOUTHS GET READY FOR 
PROM NIGHT, AN EVENT THAT CAN HIT THE HEART AND THE WALLET HARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 High school is hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this month, teen-agers all over Ventura County are choking down their 
Angst as they summon up the guts to ask the toughest question of the year: Will 
you go with me to the prom? 
</P>
<P>
 From Newbury Park High School's dance April 16 through Royal High School's 
fete on June 4, prom season hits kids straight in the heart -- and in the 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the gala promises a bright, musical swirl of glamour, it threatens a 
stab of rejection at one of the most vulnerable times of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teen-agers will throw hundreds of dollars at the evening, trying to 
ensure their prom night will be the most memorable of their young lives, only 
to walk away with little more than pain and empty pockets, adult counselors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the tension and cost, hundreds of juniors and seniors at every 
high school in the county are already hip-deep in prom plans, preparing for 
their big night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those special times for students, and I like to encourage 
every senior to go," said Toni Garubo, a guidance counselor at Adolfo Camarillo 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those moments that, in hindsight, you'll say at your 10th high 
school reunion, 'Gosh, I wish I'd gone,' " she said. "It's a moment in time. 
And we don't get too many of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Weaver, 18, a Simi Valley High senior, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the things you look forward to all your life," she said, watching 
friends clad in classy tuxes and prom dresses parade down a fashion show runway 
last week before hundreds of whooping classmates. "When you get into high 
school, that's what everyone talks about, going to the prom." 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations and prices run high. 
</P>
<P>
 A boy may spend $200 to $300 to line up tickets, limo, tuxedo, flowers and a 
ritzy restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 A girl may spend nearly $200 on a prom gown and languish for weeks waiting to 
be invited by the boy she wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teen-agers are left out or forced to accept charity -- free tickets, 
loaner dresses and borrowed tuxes -- because they just can't afford the biggest 
night of their high school career. 
</P>
<P>
 And those lucky enough to be in love already with that special boy or girl may 
see their fragile relationships crushed, adult counselors say, by the pressure 
of hard reality against their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, adult counselors said, couples may even break up before the 
prom and are forced to go through the motions of attending for fear they will 
lose money or face. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a buildup in terms of expectations," said Sara Davis, a guidance 
counselor at Royal High School in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see kids in tears because for one reason or another, something doesn't work 
out. . . . They fantasize a romantic evening with a guy that they really like," 
she said. "They're going to be so beautiful in their dress or so handsome in 
their tux -- and it doesn't happen. The guys are paling around with their 
buddies, or the girls with their girlfriends. A lot of the time, the reality 
doesn't meet the expectation." 
</P>
<P>
 The worrying starts early. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High School's prom is on May 21, five weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior A.D. Mathur, 17, is already stressed out about who he should ask, 
remembering how he stuttered and tripped while asking a girl to the Senior Ball 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really scary," A.D. said, pondering his prom prospects last week during 
lunch hour. "They could laugh at you." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled, "This girl who's a friend of mine was telling me to ask this girl 
I really like, and I said, 'No, 'cause I'll get rejected.' She said, 'After the 
first time, it gets easier and the pain wears off.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A.D. added: "But I don't know about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Hermanson, his schoolmate, tried to buck him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it if the guy's nervous when he's asking you . . . It's kind of cute," 
said Shannon, 16, a junior who has already lined up tickets with her boyfriend. 
"If the guy's all confident, like 'Hey, you want to go to the prom with me?' 
then he's probably all full of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet nowadays, the pressure of formally asking a date -- where boys must ask 
and girls must wait -- is no longer a hard-and-fast rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a boy-ask-girl issue any more," said Debbie Armstrong, junior class 
adviser at Buena High School in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls ask boys a lot more now. We're in the '90s. Girls don't wait to be 
asked, they fish around more," Armstrong said. "We have a lot of kids that do 
group dates, where there are two, three, four couples that go together." 
</P>
<P>
 Some girls are even offering to help pay for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, the guy would pay for everything," said Teresita Gomez, school 
psychologist at Oxnard High. "And it seems to be a little more equal now." 
</P>
<P>
 The clothes and tickets alone are a lot to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuxedos rent for $45 to $80, even with prom discounts offered by most formal 
wear shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional tux styles are big this year, with wildly patterned accessories 
such as paisley and floral ties and cummerbunds, said Monika Newman, manager of 
Gingiss Formalwear in The Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Prom gown prices shoot easily past $100, and some teen-agers spend as much as 
$500 for a gown. 
</P>
<P>
 But most prom gowns sell for $150 to $240, and girls this year are fond of 
long strapless sheaths in velvet with long satin gloves above the elbow, said 
Imelda Zaboski, owner of Beaux & Belles in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Prom ticket prices range from $40 per couple for Buena High School's 
dinnerless dance on April 30 at the Ventura Theater to more than $100 per 
couple (without student activities membership) for Simi Valley High School's 
May 14 dinner-dance at the Woodland Hills Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rented limousines have become popular with prom-goers who want to ride in 
style with a bunch of friends, or parents who want their kids to let someone 
else bear the risk of driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Limo rentals can cost around $65 an hour, said Bob DeMaio, general manager of 
Shoreline Limousines in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Then most youths jack up the price tag even further, paying for flowers, 
photos and post-prom parties. Some boys will buy their dates dinner out at a 
fancy restaurant beforehand, even when their proms already feature dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, one couple cruised up to Camarillo High School's prom in a 
horse-drawn carriage, he wearing a fully tailored tuxedo and she in a gown that 
looked as though it came from Beverly Hills, recalls guidance counselor Toni 
Garubo.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like one-upmanship," she said. "You can't go to a prom for less than 
probably two or three hundred dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Ferguson, a family therapist in the Conejo Valley with a teen-age 
daughter of her own, called the prom "a multihundred-dollar experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids at school tend to set up the whole thing without administrators 
taking the lead, and there's not enough guidance about keeping it affordable 
for everybody," Ferguson said. "I think it's been increasing each year." 
</P>
<P>
 The price may even shove some kids out of the prom altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that there's a lot of 'Oh well, that's OK, I don't have to go' -- a 
lot of sour-grapes kind of thing," said Gomez, the Oxnard High School 
psychologist. "But I'm sure if that's important to you, it's disappointing" not 
to have the money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students recognize how absurd the price can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the girls who spend hundreds of dollars on their dresses and rent 
limos and get $100 hairdos and makeup is a little bit excessive," said Laura 
Julian, 17, student body president at Royal High. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people, it is blown out of proportion, but most of my friends are 
pretty realistic about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools try to help teen-agers bridge the money gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo High holds a candy sale. Students can put $6 for every box of candy 
bars they sell toward the cost of their prom tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 And Buena High School gives out prom tickets and lends dresses and tuxedos to 
boys and girls who cannot pay the tab, said Debbie Armstrong, the school's 
junior class adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said students who find themselves too poor for prom night must be 
referred to her by teachers and counselors. She then provides the tickets, 
sending boys to formal-wear shops that offer free tuxedo rental and the girls 
to a school storage room full of prom dresses that have been donated to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only one on campus that knows that student has a free ticket," she 
said. "Even their date wouldn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 But once they are in -- dressed to the nines and ready to dance -- most 
teen-agers have a blast, said Sergio Castellanos, guidance counselor at Santa 
Paula High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a kick out of it as adults," said Castellanos, who is chaperoning 
Santa Paula High's May 14 prom. "It's kind of a different side of kids. 
Usually, they're relaxed on a day-to-day basis. At the prom, they feel they 
have to be on their best behavior, and their social skills will be tested. The 
young man takes the young lady out to dinner -- it's more of the adult world." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Sergey, 18, says he will probably go to the senior prom his Simi Valley 
High School class is throwing -- even if he has to go alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets, clothes, flowers and limousine will be expensive, he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 And the girl he really wanted to take turned him down, leaving him still 
looking for a date. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is important, said the handsome teen-ager, watching three tux-clad 
classmates at the school's fashion show as they pantomimed "romancing" a girl 
in a sheath dress of spangled cobalt blue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important," Sergey said a little sadly. "It's the last thing 
you're really going to remember from your senior year. You pretty much have to 
go."

DANA PARSONS: WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE FOR THE GAME, HE'S BATTING 1.000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 We're at the top of the stairs inside Joe L. Brown's home when, suddenly, much 
of the history of baseball engulfs me. It is almost jolting in its impact. Row 
after row of framed and autographed pictures of ballplayers jump off the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth . . . Williams . . . Gehrig . . . Musial . . . DiMaggio . . . Aaron . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Mazeroski's homer," Brown says, pointing to a photo showing the 
Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman still in the batter's box but having already 
connected with the fateful pitch that ended up over the left field wall in the 
bottom of the ninth of Game 7 that won the 1960 World Series for the Pirates. 
"The ball is up there someplace," Brown says, pointing toward the left field 
wall in one of the photos. . . . "Yogi Berra is playing left field." 
</P>
<P>
 The photo is one of several he has of Mazeroski's moment of baseball history, 
with the others showing Mazeroski, cap in hand, careening wildly and joyfully 
around the bases as he grasps what he has done. 
</P>
<P>
 With another baseball season upon us, I had come over to Brown's Dana Point 
home to talk some baseball. Now 75 and with 43 years in the Pittsburgh Pirates 
organization behind him, including more than 20 years as general manager, Brown 
is one of those "baseball men" who has seen the game close up. He celebrated 
two World Series while Pirates general manager. All he got to do the rest of 
the time was watch players like Clemente and Mays and Aaron and Snider and 
Koufax. "I fell in love with baseball when I was about 9 years old," he says. 
"I fell in love with the players, actually. The players were my heroes, I just 
loved them." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of famed comic actor Joe E. Brown, young Joe's first exposure was with 
the San Francisco Missions minor-league team, run by a friend of his father. 
When the Missions came to Southern California, where the Browns lived, young 
Joe would dress up in uniform, sit on the bench and soak up baseball. Other 
times, he would take train trips with the team up and down the Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1935, when he hurt his arm throwing, his father sent him to a doctor in St. 
Louis. "I spent the whole summer living in a hotel room that adjoined Pat and 
Dizzy Dean's. I was 16 years old. You think that wasn't something? Dad said to 
Pat and Dizzy, 'Now, I want you to look after my son.' After Dad left, Pat said 
to me, "I've got two kids to look after now -- you and Diz." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Brown why baseball fans are so nostalgic. "It's a game of nostalgia," 
he says. "It's a game of, 'Do you remember?' It's built upon memories. It's 
built upon Cobb and Grover Cleveland Alexander striking out Tony Lazzeri in the 
'26 World Series with the bases loaded and Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays and 
Roberto Clemente. And you go out there and you compare, and you say, 'These 
guys today aren't nearly as good.' And yet, 20 years from now, people will say, 
'Geez, do you remember Van Slyke and Bonds and, remember Piazza, and how about 
Griffey and weren't those great days?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was Pirates general manager from the 1956 season through the 1976 
season. The organization called him back from California for a brief stint in 
1985. But during his heyday, he saw what many consider to be one of baseball's 
brightest era of stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see anything special about it at the time, other than they were 
great players, but I think baseball has always had great players," Brown says. 
"The only period when it didn't was during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, you look at Frank Thomas and Griffey. . . . Piazza has a chance to be a 
Hall of Famer; he's a great talent and there are a lot of great talents. Nobody 
played like Clemente when he was playing. He had a different aura about him. 
Nobody played like Mays. They played differently, but nobody plays with any 
more zest than Andy Van Slyke." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if he still gets excited about Opening Day. "I'm just glad it's 
finally here. I like football and basketball and hockey, but let's get on with 
it. Let's get baseball here as soon as we can. I enjoy watching tennis and 
golf. I just enjoy watching people who do things well and who are competitive. 
I just happen to think baseball is the best game ever invented." 
</P>
<P>
 We talked about the passion the game generates. "Every day you win or you 
lose," he says. "That isn't true in many other businesses. Obviously, you have 
good days and bad days in business. But at the end, nobody's keeping score. You 
can make up in one day in business for a whole month of bad business. You can't 
do that in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in Pittsburgh and even in the minor leagues, every time the team 
won I was exhilarated. When the team lost, I was somewhat depressed. But it 
wasn't a lasting thing, because there's always tomorrow in baseball, always 
another year. When you don't do well and you know it's not going to be a good 
year, you start thinking about the following year." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is not one of those old-schoolers who thinks baseball has been ruined 
today. He wants a salary cap to equalize competition and hates artificial turf, 
but he doesn't decry the modern game. 
</P>
<P>
 As we talked for a while, I subtly asked if he has always been sentimental 
about the grand old game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know I was sentimental," he says wryly. "Do you feel I am?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I couldn't help but notice him dabbing at his eyes as he reflected. But 
it is by no means weepy sentimentality. I construed it as a love for the game, 
not because it paid his bills but because it shaped his life. I took it as 
Brown's unspoken knowledge that being a baseball man makes him part of 
something much larger than himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a defender of baseball," he says. "I recognize the weaknesses, but I 
think there are an awful lot of strengths to the game. I think a lot of times 
people who don't know what they're talking about criticize the game, or there 
are people who are just looking for something to be critical about." 
</P>
<P>
 I envy Joe Brown for the life he's had, for the people he's met, for the 
thrills he's had. In a way that only sports fans can appreciate, his life has 
been one of passion and burnished memories. 
</P>
<P>
 He had one last story for me. Some years ago, he says, he was in a lounge at 
Cooperstown, N.Y., site of baseball's Hall of Fame, and flanked by Hall of 
Famers Stan Musial and Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Y'know," he said in his best deadpan to Musial and DiMaggio, "we have three 
of the greatest hitters in the game sitting right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Brown, the comedian's kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Brown, the 9-year-old kid who loved baseball. The 16-year-old kid who 
lived next door to Dizzy Dean. The middle-aged man who went nuts when Mazeroski 
won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old kid who still loves the game and dabs at his eyes as he 
ponders its beauty.

PARK DISTRICT ON A SEARCH FOR FUNDS; RECREATION: WITHOUT HELP FROM LOCAL 
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES, RANCHO SIMI OFFICIALS SAY FREE EVENTS SUCH AS NEXT 
MONTH'S HUCK FINN FISHING DERBY WILL BECOME MEMORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual Huck Finn Fishing Derby, where hordes of small children descend on 
the lagoon at Rancho Simi Community Park in early May to hook catfish, is in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without a few more pancake breakfast fund-raisers such as the one the Kiwanis 
Club put on last month, Simi Valley park officials won't have the money for the 
1,800 pounds of fish it takes to stock the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the shaky state of finances of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District, which was created by the state before Simi Valley was incorporated. 
Encompassing both the city of Simi Valley and the unincorporated community of 
Oak Park, it includes 50 parks -- 35 of which are fully or partly developed -- 
totaling 2,319 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget problems have forced the district to lay off 17 of 77 employees the 
past two years. The park district's 1992 budget of nearly $8 million lost $1.1 
million in property tax revenues because of state restructuring, and park 
officials don't expect to ever see that amount restored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reality and we don't like it," park district spokesman Rick Johnson 
said. "But we're living with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Living with it means creative fund-raising solutions and asking the community 
to increase its involvement. Without help from residents and local businesses, 
park officials say free events such as the Huck Finn Fishing Derby will become 
only memories. It will cost at least $4,000 to buy the fish and stage the 
event, scheduled for May 7. The Kiwanis breakfast raised $500, and several 
companies together have donated $600, so the district is a few thousand dollars 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I've got two flyers here," said Johnson, spreading out two pieces of 
paper on his desk. "One says free, the other one has a $1 entrance fee. We've 
never charged for this event before, but we might have to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A dollar might not seem like much, but for Johnson, a 19-year veteran of the 
park district and one of the founders of the fishing derby, it's depressing to 
have to ask for it. The event draws as many as 900 children, all eager to catch 
their limit of three catfish.  
</P>
<P>
 "After all these years of free special events, it just seems kind of hard to 
get up and make the parents pay a dollar for a pole," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi Schultze, a member of the park district's board of directors, said 
community response to the district's needs has been strong so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really tried last year to reach out to the community to help us out with 
our non-revenue-producing events," Schultze said. "By working as partners with 
private industries and the community, we can get through this." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800 volunteers work occasionally with the park district, clearing 
trails, staffing special events and helping out wherever they can. About 125 of 
those volunteers provide a core that Johnson said he relies on heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Two golf courses owned by the district -- Simi Hills and Sinaloa -- are leased 
to a private operator. District board member Jim Meredith said he welcomed the 
arrangement, which began about two years ago, because it saves the district 
upkeep costs while keeping greens fees low. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten competitive and we're doing things we never would have thought 
of doing before," Meredith said. "And it's working." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Easter egg hunts in Oak Park and Simi Valley were rescued from 
cancellation by community donations that ranged from fast-food gift 
certificates to bunnies, both chocolate and stuffed. The TJ Maxx clothing chain 
donated $5,175 for the events. 
</P>
<P>
 To furnish the nearly completed community center at Rancho Santa Susana 
Community Park, officials have turned to the business community for help. The 
district took out a short-term, low-interest $3.1-million loan to construct the 
building, an imposing, gray stone structure at the eastern end of town on 
Katherine Road. But the 26,000-square-foot center still needs file cabinets, 
chairs, tables, desks and recreational equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent $23,727 donation from Simi Valley-based Micom Communications Corp. 
will furnish the lobby and recreation room, but five more rooms will remain 
bare until a benefactor comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the sponsorship, Micom gets the rooms named after it for five 
years, a tax deduction and an entitlement to hold one event a year free of 
charge in the room. In 1999, the sponsorship goes back up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze said the district hopes to make some money by offering the new 
community center to the public for wedding receptions, dinners and bar 
mitzvahs. The multipurpose room in the front of the center, complete with a 
sizable kitchen and attached patio, would be ideal, she said. Rental prices are 
still being discussed, but park officials say they will aim at being 
competitive with local hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Another topic of discussion is opening Strathearn Historical Park for weddings 
and receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the budget constraints, we're always looking for ways of raising 
revenues," Johnson said. "It's kind of tucked away in an isolated place, but 
people see how nice and quiet it is and so they want to get married there.' 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea has members of the historical society worried. They fear the 
city's oldest settled area will be damaged by party guests more concerned about 
where their next glass of champagne is coming from than about how barley 
farmers sowed their crops in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 The central feature of the six-acre park is the Simi Adobe, which was built in 
the early 1800s by the Pico family, the first Spanish settlers in Simi Valley. 
It is the oldest structure in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A Victorian addition was built onto the front of the adobe by Robert P. 
Strathearn, a Scottish settler who brought the land in 1889. He used the adobe 
as his kitchen and dining room and it remained virtually unchanged until the 
late 1950s, when his descendants installed wall heaters and a refrigerator. In 
1969, the family donated the property to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The roof and walls of the adobe were badly damaged by the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
and it has been closed since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Other buildings relocated to the grounds include the first library in Simi 
Valley and one of the original prefabricated homes brought from Chicago by 
early settlers. The atmosphere at the park is that of an old Western town set 
in the middle of suburban Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the historical society say they would like to see repairs -- 
expected to cost at least $500,000 -- made before the weddings discussion goes 
any further. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just too many unanswered questions," said Jan Smith, the society's 
president. "There are so many sensitive areas archeologically that there isn't 
a spot that would be conducive to holding a wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds may hold artifacts of the Chumash tribe, as well as items buried 
by Spanish settlers, she said. Wedding celebrants traipsing across the grounds 
is not an image Smith would like to see actualized. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze said a special wedding site, possibly a gazebo or rose garden, would 
need to be built on the grounds. She said the very limited on-site parking 
could also put a damper on plans. The fears of the historical society are 
legitimate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this caught everybody off guard, because we'd just been feeling the 
waters and had never even had an in-depth discussion," Schultze said. "But we 
only want to do something that's good for the community and good for the 
historical society and the park."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: INTERFACE CELEBRATES 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marty Bolton remembers that the plight of a family she was trying to help 
looked discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter, then 13, kept running away from home, was experimenting with 
drugs and was otherwise rebellious with her mother and stepfather. As crisis 
services director for Interface, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary, 
Bolton oversaw the girl's placement in a "cooling-off" home several times over 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 By the third time the girl had been in the Cool Home program -- where the 
nonprofit social service agency's volunteers offer to let troubled teen-agers 
stay in their homeswhile battles at home die down -- the teen-ager's parents 
were ready to abandon her, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with Interface's help, the whole family entered therapy.  
</P>
<P>
 The stepfather is learning how to manage his anger and the mother and her 
daughter are both receiving counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The family will soon be reunited and Bolton said they now stand a good chance 
of making it work. 
</P>
<P>
 It is cases like this family's (they did not want to be identified) that 
underscore what Interface has tried to do over the past 20 years, said Chris 
Rutter, the agency's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to bring fragmented families back together again," she said. "We don't 
just treat an individual problem and then let it go. We try to help the whole 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Interface celebrated its 20th anniversary in gala fashion at a posh dinner 
Friday at the Doubletree Hotel in Ventura. Besides honoring longtime members of 
the agency's advisory council, including philanthropist Alfrida Teague and 
banker A.A. Milligan, the dinner included individual lighted birthday cakes at 
each table and a rousing rendition of "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 As Interface enters its third decade the focus is the thousands of Ventura 
County residents it has helped, Rutter said. When the group started in 1973, 
its sole focus was to work with youths with drug problems, Rutter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's caseload 20 years ago was about 100; last year, Interface helped 
79,000 county residents through 16 specialized programs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are the Youth Crisis hot line, monitored 24 hours a day to help 
teen-agers and families by offering counseling and shelter; Domestic Violence 
services, offering crisis intervention for battered women; and McAvoy House, 
dedicated to providing shelter and treatment for mentally, physically and 
sexually abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just grown and evolved as the community has grown," Rutter said. KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CURFEW SWEEP LEADS TO ARRESTS OF 17 YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventeen youths were arrested by Oxnard police officers for violating a new 
citywide curfew meant to keep juveniles off the street after 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Charles Hookstra, who was in charge of the curfew task force Friday 
night, said officers confiscated a loaded 9-millimeter handgun, a starter 
pistol and a small quantity of marijuana during a three-hour sweep. They also 
found spray paint and indelible markers often used for graffiti on seven of the 
juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a success," Hookstra said. "If we had just gotten the 9-millimeter I 
would have seen the sweep as a success. I don't think they were out target 
practicing. Maybe we gave someone out there a reprieve by getting that gun off 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The department put an additional 14 officers and seven squad cars on duty 
during the beefed-up patrol Friday night during the 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Hookstra said the beginning of the curfew ordinance coincided with the start 
of spring break for many school-age youths in Oxnard. He said the Police 
Department will make random curfew patrols a regular part of its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting positive reaction," he said. "Even the parents that had to come 
in at 2 a.m. to pick up their kid who'd been arrested were thankful. They were 
mad at their kids, but they know if there wasn't an arrest, they may have never 
known what was going on." SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PORT DISTRICT BACKS LEASING NAVY WHARF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that could expand private operations at the Port of Hueneme by 
one-third, commissioners of the Oxnard Port District have tentatively approved 
leasing one of the harbor's wharves from the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Port commissioners on Monday approved in concept a plan for leasing the 
1,050-foot-long Wharf 3 from the Navy, which uses it for its cargo 
operations.The wharf is adjacent and at a right angle to Wharf 2 -- one of the 
Port of Hueneme's two commercial wharves. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the deal would be several warehouses and 25 acres of naval property 
abutting Wharf 3. The acreage would increase the size of the small commercial 
port by more than one-third. The Port of Hueneme covers 70 acres of dockside 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Details over the method and rate of payment have yet to be worked out between 
the port district and the Navy, said Raymond Fosse, port commission president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty excited," Fosse said after the vote. "Under the circumstances, 
this agreement can work well for both parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, more ships arrive at the Port of Hueneme than can be handled at 
the port's five ship berths on two wharves. With a third wharf, less time would 
be lost while ships wait outside the harbor for space. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would allow the Navy to continue use of the wharf for its own 
cargo operations. Final approval is not expected before September. PATRICK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SCATTERED SHOWERS LEAD TO HANDFUL OF ACCIDENTS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scattered showers across Ventura County early Saturday morning caught 
motorists by surprise, but the rain gave way to sunshine and gusty winds.  
</P>
<P>
 Clear skies are expected today, with temperatures in the upper 60s along the 
coast and lower 70s inland, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 A small-craft warning for winds of 15 to 25 m.p.h. could continue today, Coast 
Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm deposited 1/10 to a quarter inch of rain from Santa Barbara to 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The wet roads caused a handful of traffic accidents early Saturday morning, 
police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Police Department reported three non-injury accidents between 9 
and 10 a.m., and the Simi Valley Police Department reported two accidents about 
the same time.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of unusual for a Saturday morning to have that many," Ventura 
Police Officer Kelly Dean said. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: ROSE VALLEY; YOUTH GROUP TO USE EX-DETENTION 
FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit youth group has signed a five-year lease with the U.S. Forest 
Service for a three-acre facility in Los Padres National Forest to use as a 
quasi-boot camp for teen-agers this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 youths will make a former detention facility in Rose Valley their 
home during the work programs run by Concerned Resource and Environmental 
Workers, an Ojai-based group supported primarily by donations.The two six-week 
summer programs are aimed at boosting self-esteem while maintaining the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The site used to house criminal inmates but was closed in 1992 due to budget 
constraints, Sheriff's Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 CREW approached the Forest Service nearly two years ago with a proposal to 
turn the facility into a summer camp for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get these kids involved in something positive," CREW Director 
Paul Starbard said. "It's not only to get the (environmental) work done. . . . 
At the same time we use the forest as a tool for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers will earn $5 an hour repairing trails, cleaning campgrounds, 
launching wildlife projects and undertaking numerous other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real responsibility- and maturity-building experience," said Leslie 
Jehnings, a Forest Service official who has worked with CREW since its 
inception four years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Although CREW, which operates year round, has offered summer programs in the 
past, this is the first year the group will operate from a central facility, 
Starbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program already has received several applications for the summer program 
from local and Los Angeles teen-agers, Jehnings said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of two sessions starts June 20, Starbard said. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY SHARE OF FEDERAL AIDS FUNDS UP BY 70% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The amount of federal money being sent to help AIDS patients in Ventura County 
will jump by nearly 70% this year, due to the increasing numbers of local 
residents diagnosed with the disease, a local AIDS activist said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edie Brown, chairwoman for the Ventura County HIV Care Consortium, said both 
public and private organizations in Ventura will be eligible to receive a 
portion of $317,000 in federal aid this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, local organizations received about $187,000 in federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (federal) Ryan White funds are administered based on the numbers of 
people in the county diagnosed with AIDS, so we knew there would be an 
increase," said Brown, whose 22-group consortium will administer the federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't know it would be this big." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent figures released by the Ventura County Public Health Agency 
show that more than 400 people in Ventura have been diagnosed with acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and nearly 250 people have died from the disease 
here since 1981.  
</P>
<P>
 Grants will be given to local organizations helping those infected with the 
disease to find housing, health care and other needed services. One of the 
organizations hoping to win a grant is Christopher House, a hospice for people 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased the funds have been substantially increased over last 
year," said Tim Rawle, the administrator of the facility, which will house 
about 15 people with the disease when it opens in May. "We could definitely use 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is really meant to make sure people don't wind up on the street," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The HIV Consortium is accepting applications from any organization that 
provides one of a wide range of services, including dental care, legal advice 
and housing assistance, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications can be obtained from the Ventura County Public Health Agency at 
3147 Loma Vista Road, Suite 12, Ventura. They are due no later than May 13, and 
the grants will be awarded in July. For more information, call Brown at 
529-0564 or Susan Attaway at 652-5905. SCOTT HADLY

THOUSAND OAKS OFFERS A FORUM FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS; AFTERMATH: RESIDENTS WILL 
VOICE OPINIONS ON HOW WELL CITY STAFFERS PERFORMED AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE 
TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly three months after a frightful pre-dawn rattling sent their chimneys 
tumbling and pillars crumbling, Thousand Oaks residents will get a chance to 
criticize -- or compliment -- city staffers on their response to the Northridge 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unstructured forum Tuesday evening, the City Council will offer the 
podium to residents affected by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's building and safety managers will also have an opportunity to 
describe their programs for preventing earthquake damage and inspecting homes 
after a disaster hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get the message across that our buildings are built to code," 
Councilman Alex Fiore said. "They're supposed to withstand earthquakes of a 
certain magnitude. And in the last one, our buildings held up very well. 
Compared to other jurisdictions, even Simi, our damages were minuscule." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' quake-related losses, including every casualty from cracked 
foundations to chipped china, total an estimated $35 million, City Manager 
Grant Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The single largest chunk of damage occurred in the main library on Janss Road, 
where the collapsed metal ceiling and burst water pipes will cost about $2.5 
million to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks' cleanup tab amounts to just one-tenth of the cost in 
neighboring Simi Valley, the quake brought real pain to many. Still struggling 
to pin down responsibility, some quake victims intend to ask tough questions at 
the council forum, which starts at 8 p.m. in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for answers," resident Pat Prosser said. "I doubt the city 
has control over everything, but maybe there's a button they could push 
somewhere to get some kind of response." 
</P>
<P>
 The violent tremor tilted floorboards and cracked plaster in her Sunburst 
Drive condominium, and Prosser has still not determined who will pick up the 
repair bills. She's been poring over city and lease documents, but so far has 
found only confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of frustration, Prosser said the forum "might allow us to vent a 
lot of stress." 
</P>
<P>
 That's partly what Mayor Elois Zeanah hoped to accomplish when she scheduled 
the forum. She wanted to call attention to Thousand Oaks' suffering and perhaps 
spur the city to help its worst-hit residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the most severe damage was clustered in pockets, along certain streets 
of a few scattered developments, some victims have blamed shoddy construction 
-- or poor inspection by city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bought in good faith, thinking they were buying in a city that had one 
of the strictest building codes around," Zeanah said. "They're wondering how 
these construction defects could have escaped inspection. They want help." 
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety Director Barry Branagan has said that his inspectors 
perform spot checks as projects are built, but do not have time to monitor a 
development from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "No governmental agency in the world can guarantee that your homes won't get 
cracks during an earthquake," Councilman Frank Schillo said. "That's stupid. 
People have to realize that it was an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of complaining publicly, Schillo suggested that residents work 
directly with inspectors. "Do you want to get something done, or do you want to 
sit around and be mean and nasty?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he feared Tuesday's televised forum would degenerate into an 
all-out attack on city staff, and might sow distrust of the building and safety 
department. Several property managers agreed that the meeting could swiftly 
turn negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only hear from people who complain," said George Cox of Gold Coast Assn. 
Management. But while unhappy residents often talk louder, their gripes do not 
necessarily represent the majority view. "Most of the people we deal with got 
their inspections quickly and were very pleased," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his distaste for the public forum, Schillo said he hoped the meeting 
would offer a chance for the council to discuss a $500,000 earthquake-relief 
grant from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, distributed last week by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, is earmarked to help low- and moderate-income residents. But it 
can also be used to rebuild toppled block walls, an expense that Federal 
Emergency Management Administration grants and earthquake insurance sometimes 
do not cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something concrete where the city can come in and help," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has not yet decided how to disburse the money or whether to hold a 
public hearing for selecting recipients. Staff members are also investigating 
whether the money can be used to help refurbish the library.

TALES OF TOLERANCE; TEACHING: STORYTELLER RAY DE LA PAZ IS PART FOLKLORIST, 
PART MORALIST AND PART STAND-UP COMIC WHEN HE PERFORMS FOR SCHOOL GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The turban on Ray De La Paz's head elicits squeals of laughter from his 
audience of fifth- and sixth-graders at Barfield School in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, is that a baby blanket on your head? I hope you remembered to take the 
baby out!" he teases himself, playing both roles in a story about an American 
boy, Mickey, and a classmate from India who he taunts and then befriends. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Paz, a professional storyteller, is part folklorist, part moralist, part 
stand-up comic. The fables he invents weave lessons of cultural tolerance into 
adventure tales. And when their giggles subside, he said, children get the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey, for instance, chides the boy from India for wearing a turban, but then 
becomes enthralled when the boy presents him with a book on India that shows 
children riding elephants. As an adult, Mickey visits India and wears a turban 
to ward off the scalding heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other stories De La Paz performs, it evokes the exotic but brings it 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in our area, because we have such a distinct group of children, 
it's important for them to learn about other cultures so they can accept each 
other," said Barfield Principal Terri Mora, whose school is about 65% Latino 
and 35% black with a few Hawaiian, Vietnamese American and Korean American 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Claremont resident began telling stories as a bedtime ritual for his 
stepdaughter. She would spin a globe, and he'd spin a tale about the country 
her finger landed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he approached her principal at Jane Warner School in Altadena and asked 
to perform for the students. That went over so well that she asked him to 
return as a music and drama teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has pieced together a living telling stories, giving animation 
workshops for children and playing original songs. A graduate of Art Center's 
film department, he hopes to make multicultural children's films and is working 
on a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Without preaching, De La Paz tries to impart empathy to the children he 
teaches and performs for, drawing on his own unusual background to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York City to a Cuban mother and Panamanian father, the 39-year-old 
De La Paz said: "Spanish was my first language, culturally I was African 
American and I grew up in a white society. I grew up on the Beatles and I grew 
up on samba." 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to his grandparents in Cuba turned into a three-year exile when, at 
the age of 6, he was trapped during the Bay of Pigs invasion and refused exit 
by Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing what it is like on the other side of American missiles gave him 
insight into what the people of Iraq experienced during Desert Storm, and he 
sets some stories there to counteract negative stereotypes from the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 By getting children to laugh about their prejudices, he works at dispelling 
them.

SCHOOLS EARN HIGH MARKS FOR BILINGUAL PROGRAM; EDUCATION: THE ACCOMPLISHMENT 
WINS LENNOX SCHOOLS CHIEF KENNETH L. MOFFETT THE NATIONAL SUPERINTENDENT OF THE 
YEAR AWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At first it seems puzzling, that educators from all over the United States and 
other countries admire, tout and study the Lennox School District. It is, after 
all, a district whose students consistently perform poorly on state 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Lennox itself, which does not seem a magnet for visitors. A port 
of entry for immigrants, Lennox has become a textbook example of a community in 
the grip of poverty, gangs and crime. Most of the children in the school system 
come from one-parent families. Some live in converted garages; others live in 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are educators studying that cannot be seen in Lennox's test scores? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the district's success in teaching children -- who enter kindergarten 
speaking no English -- to speak, read and write in both English and Spanish by 
the eighth grade. It is largely for that accomplishment that Lennox Supt. 
Kenneth L. Moffett was chosen National Superintendent of the Year in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's entering students, 92% speak only Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
 "The research is very solid," Moffett said recently. "If the kids have a good 
foundation in Spanish then they can be successful. If they have poor tools in 
Spanish, then they develop poor tools in English, and the youngster is 
handicapped all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lennox School District can give the students a good foundation in Spanish 
because about 70% of the teachers are bilingual -- a higher percentage than any 
other district in the South Bay and one of the highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on speaking Spanish affects every aspect of education in Lennox, 
Moffett said. Students see role models speaking English and Spanish fluently, 
and the message to children is that the knowledge they acquired in their first 
language is worthwhile and useful. 
</P>
<P>
 And he added, the high percentage of bilingual personnel enables 
Spanish-speaking parents to more easily approach the school district or to help 
with their child's homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Another step that transformed the district was the implementation of a strict 
program of discipline. Every classroom displays a set of rules, consequences 
for violations and rewards for good behavior. Fights are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Moffett instituted the program, fights were common. Discipline was 
uneven. One teacher might punish a student for chewing gum while another 
teacher would not. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers might separate a fight and send offenders to class while others 
would send them to the principal's office -- an inconsistency that infuriated 
parents. Now every infraction of the rules is treated the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a call from a parent about a disciplinary problem in five 
years," Moffett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox fourth-graders have some of the lowest test scores in the state. But 
average test scores for students who finish eighth grade are only about 5% 
lower than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap is made up, Moffett said, because English literacy is the most 
important goal in the district, and he has hired people who agree that it 
should be. Teachers, aides, secretaries, custodians -- all are on a clearly 
defined mission. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moffett became superintendent 16 years ago, all Spanish-speaking students 
were taught by aides, and only three teachers in the district were bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett accomplished the 70% level of Spanish-English bilingualism in the 
district with a rigorous training program for teachers and a requirement that 
all newly hired employees speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers who were not bilingual were encouraged to learn Spanish, and 
bilingual aides were encouraged to become teachers. In the last five years, 35% 
of teachers hired were once teaching assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district made a deal with UCLA and Loyola Marymount: The 
universities prepared district aides and teachers for bilingual and teacher 
certification at no cost, and Lennox trained the universities' student teachers 
in district classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked very hard to make the language in the schools reflective of 
our clientele," said Moffett, who is one of the few district employees who is 
not bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox lies just east of Los Angeles International Airport and north of 
Hawthorne. The 1990 Census put the city's population at 22,757 -- about 19,400 
of whom are Latino and 1,433 are black. The city also has small Filipino, 
Tongan and Vietnamese populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tongan population is beginning to grow and the school district may have to 
offer more extensive bilingual services in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The state requires that students with limited proficiency in English be taught 
major subjects such as science, math and social studies in their primary 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole aim is for them to learn English, but while they're taking the five 
to seven years it takes to think academically in a second language, they're 
still learning (other subjects)," said Norman Gold, manager for bilingual 
compliance for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that teaching in the primary language is always the best answer for 
every child, but it's always the best starting point." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that parents who do not speak much English are more likely to become 
involved in their child's school and homework if the home language is used. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lennox, students who speak limited English are taught subjects in Spanish 
from kindergarten through third grade. Students take courses in both English 
and Spanish in fourth grade and are in English-only classes by fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before their students make the transition to English-only classes, 
teachers in Lennox are using English in their lessons and in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the last day before spring vacation at Whelan Elementary school. Only an 
hour is left in the school day, and the second-graders in Lisa Falagan's class 
are fidgeting with excitement, talking and jumping out of their chairs to ask 
her questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Falagan, a first-year teacher, is urging them to finish their final project, a 
timeline of important events in their lives, before vacation. As part of a 
social studies lesson on biographies, the children have written dates on the 
front of index cards and important events in their lives on the back.  
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Ochoa, 7, wearing a hat with a big carnation pinned in front, 
finishes early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is my timeline," she said in Spanish, flipping the cards to the year 
1987. On the back was written in English, "I was born!" 
</P>
<P>
 Falagan walks through the room, punching holes in the index cards and 
measuring string for the children to make necklaces of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of Cuban refugees, Falagan worked full time in the Lennox School 
District to put herself through college. Before becoming a teacher, she was a 
teaching assistant, a technician in the Whelan computer laboratory and a 
preschool instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of the teachers district officials point to with pride when they 
discuss the aide-to-teacher program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lesson in biographies, the children also studied the lives of famous 
people, including Martin Luther King Jr., Shakespeare and Pablo Picasso. The 
lessons on Picasso were particularly popular. 
</P>
<P>
 First Falagan asked the children to draw a portrait of her. Then after 
teaching them about Cubism, she asked them to draw her portrait a la Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, this one's mine," said Veronica, pointing to a multi-nosed drawing. 
"Isn't it pretty?" 
</P>
<P>
 To drive home her lesson, Falagan, who lives in Long Beach, has been taking 
students, four at a time, to see the Picasso exhibit at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 For the creativity and zeal Falagan displays in her teaching -- in school, 
after school and on weekends -- Whelan Principal Ken Knott is nominating her 
for district New Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Falagan's dedication is not unusual in the Lennox district. Teachers arrive 
long before the students do and stay into the evening to tutor, mentor and 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 For their dedication, the teachers are paid more than those in similar 
districts. Nearly 70% of the 216 teachers make more than $40,000 a year and, of 
those, 32% make more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We staff lean, but we pay teachers well," Moffett said. "We have to have 
something to attract people to come here."  
</P>
<P>
 At Lennox Middle School, the sports clubs have no funding for transportation, 
so the teachers, who volunteer to coach, also transport the students to and 
from games and often take them home afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its many activities, the school has a handball club, a drama club and a 
group that helps homeless people. Teachers take students to plays, to movies, 
sports events and museums, fighting to keep them off the streets and out of 
gangs. They stay late to help with homework or console a child who's having 
trouble at home.  
</P>
<P>
 But the activism sometimes takes its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good place to work, but it can be hard, very hard," said physical 
education teacher Karen Korzelius. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lennox Middle School, she coaches the girls basketball team, teaches class, 
and takes kids to games. If their parents don't show up afterward, she takes 
them home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I bought a Blazer when I traded in my Nissan pickup truck," she 
said with a sigh. "It has more room for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett's rule requiring Spanish speaking for just about anybody in the 
district who has to speak out loud is not always easy to follow, some 
administrators say. But most seem to agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something that Dr. Moffett has been relentless on, which has been good 
for us as a district -- frustrating for me as a principal, but good," said 
Lennox Middle School Principal Larry Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say that we cater too much to the necessities of our kids, but 
the majority of people here accept that bilingual education is the way to go," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Head Counselor Pam Rector is often the last person to leave Lennox Middle 
School. It is her job to see that more Lennox students go to college. Even 
former students who are now in high school visit after school, and parents come 
when they get off work. 
</P>
<P>
 She often takes students to see college campuses.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unless kids can visualize themselves at a college, they can't get there," 
Rector said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before spring break, mentors from Loyola Marymount University, who tutor 
Latino students at the middle school several times a week, invited them to 
spend the day at Loyola and then sleep over. The program is called El Espejo, 
The Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it that because we hope they look at the college students and see 
themselves," Rector said. "In return, the tutors look at the kids and remember 
themselves at a young age." 
</P>
<P>
 Toting sleeping bags, the students arrived early in the morning, both boys and 
girls wearing the urban adolescent uniform of flannel shirts and loose jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 They were surprised to see so many Latinos on campus and to find out how much 
fun it was to be at college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that college would be, like, all work and homework and that the 
people would be, well, kind of geeky," said Danny Godoy, 13. "But they're nice; 
they're not racist at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Godoy's mentor is Juan Cueva, 18, an engineering major who graduated from 
Lennox Middle School and Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it feels good to do something and give back to the community. I 
wouldn't be here if somebody had done it for me -- if it weren't for Pam 
(Rector)," Cueva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cueva turned to Rector, even though he had left the district. Lennox schools 
only include kindergarten through eighth grade. After middle school, students 
attend Hawthorne High School, where Lennox counselors say their former students 
either have great success or tend to get lost in the crowd and drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell us that we coddle the kids and spoil them so that they're not ready 
for high school," Rector said. "We feel like they're just not as supportive as 
they should be of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox officials yearn to have a high school in the community but say there is 
no money to open one. So the Lennox staff tries to nurture the students from a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett's crusade to educate the children of Lennox is, in part, because he 
looks at them and sees himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett's German grandparents immigrated to the United States and came West in 
a covered wagon, happy if they found enough food for the day, he said. His 
family settled in a small logging community in Washington state, and he grew up 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on my own since I was 17, and I put myself through college," the 
58-year-old Moffett said. "I think I've always liked working with poor 
children. They're very honest. What you see is what you get." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a finalist for the National Superintendent of the Year Award, 
Moffett and three other superintendents flew to Washington to interview with a 
panel. To this day, he is not sure why he was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they asked me what I'm proud of," he said. "I told them that I'm most 
proud of the attitude we've been able to create here, because it's an area 
people could really give up," Moffett said. "And we don't."

HANDSHAKE BAN SETS BAD EXAMPLE FOR ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It was disturbing to read the story (March 25) about the banning of 
handshakes after high school sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on winning at all costs has taken precedence over the enjoyment 
and learning experience derived from the competition itself. 
</P>
<P>
 What message and lesson is being taught by an adult, a coach in this case, who 
says he isn't sure "if someone is beating you pretty good that you want to go 
shake hands?" Maybe someone who feels that way is taking winning and losing a 
little too personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as learning and accepting the word "no" is important for an infant or 
child, realizing that for every winner someone has to lose is also a valuable, 
if sometimes painful, lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe even more so, as it can teach a person character and humility and often 
inspires perseverance and the willingness to keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't a student athlete be taught to strive to be the best, prepare well 
and train hard to become better, and feel bad only when he or she doesn't give 
the best effort? The reality is that sometimes the other guy is just better 
than you are.

PUSHING THE LIMITS OF DISASTER; WIDESPREAD DAMAGE SHOULD MAKE IT 'GREATER LOS 
ANGELES EARTHQUAKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the wildfires last autumn? There were several, and each blaze had a 
name. Collectively, however, the disaster was known as the Southern California 
firestorm, an important distinction that told folks throughout the nation that 
the damage was indiscriminate and widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad earthquakes are named for their epicenters, or at least for where the 
experts initially presume the epicenter to be. In the example that concerns us 
here, the "Northridge" name reveals little about the destructive seismic force 
that also befell Santa Monica, the Newhall Pass and Sherman Oaks, to name a few 
other hard-hit areas. This is a matter of some importance when one considers 
the fact that those who control the state and federal aid spigots are often 
hundreds or thousands of miles distant. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can now add the city of San Fernando to the slowly growing list of 
communities that were struck much more severely by the main quake and its 
aftershocks than anyone might have believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 7.5% of the 5,700 residential units in this northern San Fernando 
Valley locality have been declared unsafe or restricted to limited entry. More 
than 10% of its commercial units sustained similar damage. This means that the 
rebuilding effort there must include a thorough accounting of what 
circumstances, including seismic shaking and building codes, contributed to the 
severe impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps now the folks who name these things will get around to calling this 
one the Greater Los Angeles Earthquake.

EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO THE COYOTE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I attended the meeting on coyote trapping, and I would like to clarify a few 
points brought forth in your story "Coyote Trapping Debate Continues" (March 
24). 
</P>
<P>
 First, you mention that the conflict is between wildlife conservationists who 
oppose trapping and San Fernando Valley residents who say trapping is needed 
for protection.The majority of people who attended the meeting are Woodland 
Hills and West Hills residents who oppose trapping the coyotes. It is not 
residents vs. conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, you fail to mention the scientific facts regarding coyote populations 
that were discussed by various experts. Trapping will not resolve the issue of 
the coyotes' alleged presence in our hillside neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you close by discussing the option of "nontoxic salt" to discourage 
coyotes from entering neighborhoods. You fail to mention that the board 
overwhelmingly agreed that more education of hillside residents seems to be a 
key to resolving this problem, not poisoning the coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that any further articles The Times undertakes regarding this issue 
will include all information presented, not just an emotional account of a 
select few who are obviously ignorant of the facts regarding the coyote 
populations residing in our hills.

EVICTED BARBERS ARE HEROES FOR HELPING HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Jim Carcioppolo and Tom Wilson, featured in "Evicted Barbers Sweep Up for 
Last Time" (March 27), would not remember, but I used to take my two sons in 
for haircuts when they were little. Going into the barbershop was like setting 
foot in the '50s of my childhood.I noticed the old calendars and the ancient 
piano, wondering if anyone ever played it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 We have lived in this neighborhood for 18 years and never expected to see our 
local barbershop close, and for the most ridiculous of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim and Tom were part of the solution to the problem of homelessness, giving 
free haircuts and providing a small haven of camaraderie and caring to those 
down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 For the landlord to evict them for this reason really stinks! It seems to me 
that the landlord is contributing to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He could provide odd jobs for them in the spaces that he rents out. He could 
encourage his tenants to provide discounts for their merchandise and services 
(in return for a rental discount) and he could offer them gift certificates to 
Lucky's (across the street) when they are hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 He could now even consider converting the vacant barbershop into a day shelter 
or donating the space to a food bank or other social service agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people are just that: people, like all of us. Most of them are not 
dangerous, and the problems they have will not disappear until we treat them 
with dignity. For their gentle kindness, Jim and Tom are quiet heroes to my 
entire family.

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; THE ROBERTI RECALL -- A FOOLISH IDEA AND A WASTE OF MONEY; 
THE GUN LOBBY'S POLITICAL REASONING IS EASY TO SHOOT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in the 20th Senate District -- which includes Reseda, Van Nuys, North 
Hollywood, Panorama City, Pacoima and Sylmar -- face an important civic 
responsibility on Tuesday. They will take part in the first recall election of 
a state official in 80 years. Recall elections are a fundamental right in a 
democracy, but the process has been horribly abused in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes are trying to recall state Sen. David A. Roberti, a Democrat, and throw 
him out of office a few months early because of his eminently sensible stance 
on gun control. One of his initiatives, in 1989, was co-sponsoring a ban on 
military-style semiautomatic weapons. For such displays of courage, Roberti has 
been targeted by the gun lobby. He has not violated the law or the public's 
trust, and voters should cast a ballot to keep him in office for the remaining 
months of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by the charge that the Roberti recall is nothing more than a political 
vendetta, his opponents have offered other reasons for the campaign to vote him 
out of office less than eight months before he is scheduled to step down. The 
arguments have little substance. We'll deal with them one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Claimed reason 1: Recall Roberti because he opposed term limits. Well, they 
don't get any sillier than this. If term limits had been defeated, the argument 
might make a little more sense (not much more, but a little). We now have term 
limits, however, thanks to the voters. That's why Roberti can't run for the 
20th Senate District seat again. That's why his name cannot appear on the 20th 
District primary ballot on June 7. That's why he's stepping down from the seat 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Claimed reason 2: Political accountability for corruption in Sacramento. Well, 
last we heard, the folks who admitted transgressions or were justly convicted 
for corruption, the Alan Robbinses and Pat Nolans, were getting their just 
deserts. Roberti has not been accused of any such wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Claimed reason 3: Recall Roberti, the liberal tax-and-spend Democrat. Oh, 
please. This particular recall election will be meaningful for just eight 
weeks. That's how long 20th District voters have to wait until the real 
election, the primary, takes place on June 7th. For this, the Los Angeles 
County government has to ante up $800,000 to $1 million, and perhaps more, to 
conduct the recall election. That just adds to the roughly $1-billion projected 
deficit already facing the county. This is fiscal responsibility? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the five challengers on the recall ballot amount to little more 
than a cast of wanna-bes and also-rans who do little to shed the image of this 
election as a vendetta by gun lovers and the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Randy Linkmeyer, a former sales representative for a national gun store 
distributor who bought Art's Guns in Canoga Park in 1990. Linkmeyer helped 
found the Constitutional Rights Federation to fight gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Bill Dominguez, a systems analyst from Van Nuys, who has said that he 
owned his first gun at the age of 8 and who recently reported the theft of 12 
more recently acquired guns from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Al Dib, the retired owner of a produce market, who has run for public 
office four times. He urges the following foolishness on a nation weary of gun 
violence: the abolition of all statutes outlawing concealed weapons and machine 
guns. Dib's campaign adviser, Manny Fernandez, was purged from the recall 
coalition after he was quoted saying the movement was the gun lobby's revenge 
against Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Larry Martz, a Van Nuys handyman who chairs the Valley chapter of the 
American Pistol and Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Dolores White, a real estate broker who earned a whopping 
10.5% of the vote against Roberti in 1992. "We need to draw a bead on David 
Roberti and bring him down to send a message to Sacramento," White said to the 
audience at a National Rifle Assn.-sponsored forum for the recall election. 
Nice choice of words, Dolores. 
</P>
<P>
 How much gun money is fueling the Roberti recall? Well, of the meager amount 
raised by recall backers in the past year (just $164,000 as of late March), 
more than half a dozen of the largest contributions came from gun or ammunition 
makers. Kevin Washburn, manager of the effort to recall Roberti, claimed that 
$30,000 came from a victims' rights group. Washburn touted the money as 
evidence of the diversity of recall backers. Wrong. The head of the alliance 
that gave the $30,000 later told reporters that it was indeed closely tied to 
gun-lobby interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters in the 20th District who have a stake in good government, who decry 
such blatant attempts at purposeless political retribution, can send the right 
message on Tuesday by casting a ballot for Roberti.

GUNS ARE NOT THE ONLY ISSUE IN ROBERTI RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Outrage! The media's lack of balanced coverage of the recall of state Sen. 
David Roberti is maddening. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time he's being interviewed he waves a gun and says, "This is what it's 
all about."Not true! That's a smoke screen contrived to cover up the real 
issues. Where are the tough questions? If guns were the only issue, why are so 
many non-gun-rights citizen groups supporting the recall? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti voted against Proposition 13. He voted for a bill to allow property 
tax increases without a vote of the people. He voted to lower the votes needed 
to raise taxes. He voted for Senate Constitutional Amendment 2, lowering the 
vote needed to raise property taxes. He raised vehicle registration and license 
fees. There's nothing this world-class spender won't tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert used taxpayer money for a lawsuit against term limits, trying to defeat 
the will of the people. Voters passed Propositions 68 and 73, which would have 
reduced special-interest influence by limiting contributions. Roberti sued the 
voters and overturned those needed reforms. Roberti has voted 10 times to raise 
his own pay. And now he wants to run for state treasurer? Enough! 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti failed to support the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act and opposed 
"three strikes and you're out" until he saw that the public overwhelmingly 
favored tougher anti-crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not a member of the National Rifle Assn. It is in the interest of every 
Californian to give the boot to this carpetbagger before he can do more damage. 
That's why the recall is supported by People's Advocate, begun by Paul Gann; 
the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau; Citizens for Law & Order; Californians 
Against Corruption; Townkeepers Action Group, and other grass-roots citizen 
organizations.

AID PROGRAMS DON'T MEET NEEDS OF QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article "Quake Fails to Shake Valley's Housing Glut" (March 27) failed 
to deal with two critical areas that have contributed not only to the "glut" 
but to a significant delay to true recovery for thousands of quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's policy is to provide 
significant aid to the single-family homeowner, including a large initial check 
for relocation, and continuing rental subsidies while the home is being 
repaired with additional FEMA grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants are based on an evaluation of need and continue as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The renter however, receives no such aid. Regardless of need, the renter 
receives a check marked "two months rent" and then no further aid of any kind! 
Again regardless of need. In fact, while the renter has only the Individual and 
Family Grant Program (a state program funded by the department of Housing and 
Urban Development), FEMA has been unable to transmit the needed forms to the 
grant program office, resulting in additional difficulty for the quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The second area of problems lies in the fact that the Section 8 subsidy 
program will not allow the renter to add money to the subsidy. Rather the 
program has set severe limits on subsidy, based solely on family size, and will 
not allow any flexibility in decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 While the original thinking by HUD may have been to protect the renter from 
landlord abuse, this is a critical failure of the program, since it limits its 
value to the displaced middle class as well as to the working poor who have 
earned the right to improve their lot. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, my wife and I are senior citizens on Social Security and SSI. We 
are ineligible for Small Business Administration loans. We lost a two-bedroom 
apartment in the quake. We need the second bedroom to operate a home-based 
business. The Section 8 offer was for no more than a one-bedroom apartment 
subsidy of some $630. Our need for the second room is critical to our recovery. 
Needless to say, not only were we refused, nobody cared to ask if we needed 
further help. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion is that the programs that are out there are not enough to meet 
their intended goals and need to be changed. Unfortunately, no one seems to 
care.

CRIME ARTICLE SHOULD HAVE HAD A FOLLOW-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On March 29 you had a five-sentence story on the arrest "after a brief 
chase" of two heavily armed men driving in Encino. They were accused of illegal 
possession of weapons, according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times has lots of subscribers in Encino and other Valley 
communities. Do you think they might be interested in the details, including 
what happened next? I am. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the judge or state entity that paroled one of these men? Are the 
accused in jail on these new charges or out on bail? Will you check out if they 
will be tried, or will they simply plea-bargain themselves back on the street? 
Do these goons have to kill someone before our society takes note of their 
conduct to date? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think follow-up on matters of legitimate interest to your readers is 
appropriate? If not, we might as well all just watch television news programs.

SEWAGE PLAN THREATENS HEALTH IN ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A large corporation is planning to haul 20 truckloads (500 tons) of Los 
Angeles sewage sludge every day from the Hyperion and Terminal Island sewage 
treatment plants and dump it on the west side of the Antelope Valley to 
manufacture compost. 
</P>
<P>
 This sludge will contain all the heavy metals -- arsenic, cadmium, copper, 
lead, mercury, nickel and chromium, just to name a few that are deadly -- from 
the drains of all the commercial and industrial plants in Los Angeles.Add to 
that the pathogens, viruses and diseases like hepatitis B, polio and 
tuberculosis, from the many hospitals and the daily flushes of Los Angeles 
toilets.  
</P>
<P>
 A plan has been approved to dump it in an area where residents all depend on 
well water to drink. And dump it on a flood plain where water has been known to 
flow more than three feet deep. And dump it upwind of the citizens who live out 
there, some unfortunate ones who have built their dream homes right across the 
street from a lovely alfalfa farm. Our 30 m.p.h. to 50 m.p.h. winds will 
deposit this debris in all directions. These same winds closed some valley 
roads with six feet of blowing sands during the last drought. 
</P>
<P>
 What will this mean to our health? What will it do to the value of the 
property around this 67 acres of blight? Will those who live right across the 
street have to move to protect their families? 
</P>
<P>
 This is a threat to the air, water and health of every valley resident.

 On good days, they pooled their money from collecting cans and bottles to pay 
for dinner -- chicken in the toaster oven, instant mashed potatoes and a couple 
of cans of green beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, though, they collected their belongings in plastic sacks, swept up 
the band shell and left the park for good. In a unique agreement, Pasadena city 
officials and social services providers reached a deal with regulars in the 
park's homeless encampment, asking them to leave in exchange for a program 
designed to help them find a new life elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowden, 60, was so excited by the prospect that he couldn't sleep during his 
last night in the park, tossing and turning and then waking at dawn, like a 
little boy on Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the encampment was like family; sure, he called the place home. But he 
chuckled at the thought that he would want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mind leaving here?" he said with good-natured sarcasm. "Mind going on to 
something better? I look at it like this: The beginning is now to start anew, 
rebuild ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Memorial Park has been a popular homeless encampment, with its 
broad expanses and charming band shell. Church volunteers regularly dropped off 
food and clothing. Park officials left the bathrooms unlocked at night. Police 
officers didn't enforce the park's 10 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, during the Altadena wildfire, the homeless encampment drew 
attention because its inhabitants lit fires at night for warmth. Then the 
Pasadena Senior Center, next door to the park, announced expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 And then a local theater group, Theater Quest, announced plans to use the band 
shell for classical theater productions for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 So the deal was put together, with suggestions from the park's regulars, by 
city officials and Joe Colletti, director of Lutheran Social Services in 
Pasadena. The city agreed to contribute $15,000 for the interim shelter and 
case management program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the arrangement, the nine homeless men and two homeless women get 45 
days of interim shelter at New Revelation Baptist Church in Pasadena. During 
that period, Lutheran Social Services case managers will work with each person, 
helping with everything from job interviews, transportation, legal papers, 
credit advice and welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to get each person into a rehabilitation program, shelter or 
housing within 45 days, Colletti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 homeless people have agreed to never sleep in Memorial Park again, and 
police will start enforcing the park's curfew and no-camping ordinance, 
officials said.

CAMPAIGN'S BITTER ROOTS RUN DEEP; POLITICS: BILL MABIE AND ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA 
ARE LOCKED IN A BRUISING PRIMARY FIGHT TO FILL RICHARD POLANCO'S 45TH ASSEMBLY 
DISTRICT SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an area with a history of bitter campaigns, the June Democratic primary 
race in northeast Los Angeles' 45th Assembly District is likely to mirror past 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Front-runners Bill Mabie and Antonio Villaraigosa are gearing up for a 
bruising primary contest to fill a seat being vacated by Assemblyman Richard 
Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who is running for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner is virtually assured of victory in the November general election 
because 62% of the district's registered voters are Democrats. Three other 
Democrats, one Republican and one Libertarian candidate are also running. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the Latino-majority district not only pits candidates backed by 
two political rivals -- Polanco and Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina 
-- but also threatens to divide Latinos who have supported Polanco. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Polanco allies are upset that he is endorsing Mabie, his white chief of 
staff, in a district that has had Latino representation in the Assembly for 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is also clouded by the threat of a no-holds-barred slugfest. Each 
camp, vowing to stick to the issues, is charging that the other is preparing to 
run a dirty campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco won his Assembly seat in a bitter 1986 contest against then-Highland 
Park bondsman Mike Hernandez, who is now a Los Angeles City Council member. The 
election was marred by criticism of Polanco campaign mailers accusing Hernandez 
of "making money" by letting child molesters and rapists "out on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's race is shaping up to be no less confrontational, especially 
because the consultant who designed the 1986 mailers, Richie Ross, is directing 
Mabie's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Polanco has said to at least three individuals that this is going to 
be the dirtiest campaign that the Eastside has ever seen," Villaraigosa said. 
"It's been a modus operandi for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco denies making those comments. And Mabie called Villaraigosa's remarks 
"political disinformation." He said he is running the campaign, not Polanco or 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie also questioned why Villaraigosa paid $6,000 to hire Smart Campaigns, a 
Northern California firm that researches opposing candidates. Such firms 
generally compile background information used to discredit or smear an 
opponent's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's planning to run a clean campaign, I can't understand why he would 
spend that kind of money for that type of firm," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa says the race is his to lose, pointing to his longtime ties to 
the community and a host of high-powered endorsements. Along with Molina, his 
supporters include Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), Lucille Roybal-Allard 
(D-Los Angeles) and Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente); Hernandez and fellow Los 
Angeles City Council members Jackie Goldberg and Mark Ridley-Thomas; county 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those endorsements reflect an acknowledgment of my 25 years of 
grass-roots work on behalf of this community," said Villaraigosa, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie, 32, countered that Villaraigosa's endorsements reflect his connection 
to the "Molina machine" more than his community support. Come election day, he 
says, voters will look at the qualifications of the candidates, not who is 
backing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this contest is judged on the merits of the candidates, I think I come out 
ahead," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie is endorsed by Assembly members Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) and Martha 
M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park), and Los Angeles Councilman John Ferraro, among 
others. He is also endorsed by the Hollywood Highlands Democratic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Actively campaigning since the fall, Villaraigosa has amassed a commanding 
20-to-1 lead in fund raising. According to campaign statements, Villaraigosa 
has raised $105,218 so far and says he hopes to collect an additional $245,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie reported raising $5,405 of the $150,000 he says he will need to win the 
race. He discounts his opponent's fund-raising lead, saying that "early money 
is like a quarter in a kid's hand -- it's spent quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates say crime, education and economic development are the 
district's top concerns. Both tout their community work and their respective 
backgrounds as making them the most qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a doctor, Mabie grew up with eight brothers and sisters in a 
comfortable home in the east San Gabriel Valley city of Claremont. After 
graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in political science, he 
joined the Peace Corps and spent two years in Honduras, where he designed and 
managed fish hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie is president of the Highland Park Chamber of Commerce, among other civic 
organizations. He is also the founder of Gardens for Kids, a nonprofit 
organization that builds gardens at urban schools in Los Angeles to teach 
youths about science and agricultural careers. He and his wife live in Highland 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have worked with the people of this district, from Ramona Gardens to 
Hollywood, from Echo Park to Eagle Rock, and I know the issues that are 
important to the residents of this area," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa is one of four children raised by a single mother in a poor home 
in the Eastside neighborhood of City Terrace. Although he dropped out of 
Roosevelt High School in the 11th grade, he says he re-enrolled the next year 
and graduated on time in 1971 after attending day and night classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa graduated from UCLA with a degree in history. He has served as 
president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and 
president of Local 3200 of the American Federation of Government Employees, 
among other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 As Molina's alternate to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board of 
directors, he has developed a reputation as an advocate for bus riders. 
Villaraigosa lives with his wife and four children in Mt. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been battling to increase representation and opportunities for everyone 
all of my life," Villaraigosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos have represented portions of the 45th District since 1968. Within the 
district's current boundaries, which stretch from Highland Park to Echo Park, 
63% of the 370,000 residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has been the focus of lengthy civil rights battles that resulted in 
court-ordered reapportionments to create Latino-majority districts for the City 
Council and county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Polanco supporters charge that he has turned his back on those 
hard-fought victories by endorsing Mabie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of maintaining and electing Latino candidates, especially in a 
district where we have fought so hard for Latino representation," said state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who backed Polanco when he was first elected 
to the Assembly but said he will consider Villaraigosa in this year's contest 
if the campaign gets dirty. "Certainly, candidates who are not Latinos would 
have ample opportunity to run in other districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco said there were several Latinos he would have endorsed, such as 
Leticia Quezada, president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, but that none 
was willing to run. He said he decided that Mabie was the most qualified 
candidate.

THE VOTERS' RIGHT TO RECALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY; IT IS RESERVED FOR 
REMOVING OFFICIALS WHO ARE GUILTY OF CRIME, MALFEASANCE OR OMISSION OF DUTY. 
BUT INCREASINGLY, IT IS BEING USED BY OPPORTUNISTS.

By JON ROBERT LORENZEN, Jon Robert Lorenzen is the owner of Lorenzen Media 
Services in Reseda, which provides writing services to clients. In 1992 he was 
a candidate for the Republican nomination for the California Assembly in the 
40th District, which is part of Roberti's 20th Senate District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recall as practiced in California today is the most insidious part of our 
political process. In many respects it is an act of political rebellion. It 
requires the petitioners, those who advocate the removal from office of an 
elected official, to turn to character assassination for their success. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally the targeted elected official is the scoundrel that petitioners 
portray. However, increasingly, the recall process is being used by political 
opportunists to blindside elected representatives with opposing points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall is tantamount to impeachment and should possess the same standards of 
significance and sincerity. It is the politicization of a judicial role 
reserved for the electorate whereby the voter is permitted to decide if an 
elected official has committed criminal acts, malfeasance or omissions of duty 
and deserves removal from office. It should not be taken lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against state Sen. David Roberti is void of the foundation necessary 
to justify his removal. Roberti and I are partisan adversaries, yet there is 
zilch, zip, nada, absolutely nothing in his political or professional career 
that would warrant the disgrace of being recalled. The diatribe charging 
corruption circulated by the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity and 
Californians Against Corruption, the chief organizing committees of this 
fiasco, is nothing more than political rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged grounds for recall are that Roberti: 
</P>
<P>
 * Moved into the district in 1992, where he won a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supported the regulation of treacherous assault weapons in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * Served as president pro tempore of the Senate in an era when other members 
of the body were found guilty of crimes. The recall sponsors clearly hope the 
voters will conclude that he is guilty by mere association. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these charges are criminal acts nor are they acts representing 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues of residency and his political philosophy were presented to the 
voters and decided upon in 1992. As far as his associations go, what would the 
gun dealers say if we convicted them of criminal conspiracy for selling assault 
weapons to criminals? 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of this recall are operating on a purely political level. The worst 
"crime" Roberti has committed is achieving a level of respectability and 
leadership. Being elected president pro tem of the Senate by his colleagues 
brings the responsibility of ensuring that the state's work is done. He has 
done so with fairness and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 We elect officeholders who we believe will best represent our viewpoints. We 
cannot demand or expect that they vote precisely as we demand on every issue. 
We entrust specific legislation to our representatives in the belief that they 
will apply their best judgment to the detailed information available to them. 
Nothing denies the right of the electorate to petition their representative, 
but once a legislative decision has been made, we as an electorate should then 
use that information to judge the record at the next election cycle -- not use 
it for prosecutorial fodder in a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls are not referendums on political philosophy. Those who damage the 
integrity of our rights, through misuse, for their political egos need to be 
reminded that the electoral process is the foundation of our freedoms. 
Perversion of the recall mechanism, as this surely is, filets open its 
pseudo-judicial role for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the only recall process that has attempted to bastardize the 
political process and it probably won't be the last. Roberti has not committed 
a crime that would justify this form of crucifixion. Those who are attempting 
to discredit him should be rejected by all of us on Tuesday.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; EDUCATION COULD FINALLY GET THAT LONG-AWAITED WAKEUP CALL; 
STANDARDS IS THE BUZZWORD, AND EVERYBODY IS JUMPING ON THE BANDWAGON TO WRITE 
THEM. PATIENCE IS NEEDED BECAUSE BIG CHANGES WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

Angeles Unified School District.

 If Rip Van Winkle had fallen asleep in the 1930s and had awakened in 1994, the 
only place where he'd feel comfortable would be in a public school. There he 
would find the same dusty chalkboards, rows of desks occupied by kids doing 
long division with pencils and teachers lecturing in front of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of society, of course, has moved from agrarian to industrial and on 
to an information-driven age. Yet we are teaching the kids the same old things 
in the same old way, preparing them for an industrial-based workplace which is 
growing more and more rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, there is a chance that substantive change is under way. Standards is 
the buzzword of the hour; everybody is jumping on the bandwagon to write them 
-- and the President is driving the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals 2000, a new federal program aimed at education reform conceived during a 
1990 governors' conference headed by then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, was 
signed into law last week by President Bill Clinton. It is an effort to put the 
federal government in a leadership role in establishing national scholastic and 
skills standards. It calls on local school districts to establish higher 
standards to prepare our children to enter the 21st Century. The federal 
government is offering seed money to schools that accept the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, anticipating passage of the law, had already started thinking 
seriously about standards, through a program it calls the Quality Education 
Design Collaborative. This is an effort to establish a set of communally 
agreed-upon education standards whose attainment would assure a graduate's 
post-high-school success. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in January, intrigued by the question "What do our students need to 
know?" I joined the voluntary project and attended a three-day training session 
at UCLA. There, Charlotte Higuchi, a Los Angeles elementary school instructor 
assigned to the QED-C, introduced 114 teachers, parents, business leaders and 
community representatives to the national debate on standards. 
</P>
<P>
 A national standard is quite broad. It might look something like this: 
"Students will be able to reflect on what they have learned from a variety of 
sources and apply that knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, acting on its own, began a 
discussion five years ago and has written broad national standards for math. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: "In grades K-4 the study of mathematics should emphasize problem 
solving so that students can: use problem solving approaches to investigate and 
understand mathematical content; formulate problems from every day and 
mathematical situations; and verify and interpret results with respect to the 
original problem." The National Education Standards and Improvement Council 
being created by the new federal law could do worse than to adopt the math 
teachers' standards. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts are to decide what will happen in classrooms so students can 
meet these objectives. In Los Angeles this is happening with volunteers who 
include teachers, parents and outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the QED-C debuted its standards program to participants from 200 
schools at eight sites around the city. Larry Tesh, the principal at Walter 
Reed Junior High School in North Hollywood, hosted our session. Nearly 60 
people attended, primarily teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting went slowly, and we got off track occasionally, but after two 
hours we were fairly focused and into a substantive discussion of what kids 
need to know. 
</P>
<P>
 We have five more meetings scheduled between now and June. (Anyone is welcome; 
call an LAUSD school for dates and places.) When we're done, we will have a set 
of standards we think are important. Our ideas will be compiled and 
consolidated with standards from the other sites. And that will be only the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising school standards is not just a job for educators. Parents will have to 
see that their children report to school ready to learn, and some students will 
have to work a lot harder. We will need community support in the form of 
technologically equipped classrooms, and we will need patience because big 
changes won't happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, I'm feeling more optimistic than usual these days. I'm on the 
bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 We teachers don't have to wait for the process to be completed before asking 
more of students. I've been reading the preliminary report, prepared by the 
National Council for Teachers of English, on national language arts standards. 
It contains some model lesson plans aimed at pushing high school students to 
meet broad goals. One, for example, sets out to help kids find real-life 
meaning in literature by discussing a passage in "Black Boy," the Richard 
Wright novel, and then writing about prejudice in their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, instead of just putting a grade on a paper I'm asking that 
students' assignments be rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm also re-examining my lesson plans, throwing away those that don't meet the 
highest standards and keeping those that do. And my wastebasket is usually 
full.

PARENTS PICKET AT MASSAGE PARLOR; POMONA: HEARINGS ARE UNDER WAY TO DETERMINE 
IF THE CITY CAN DENY AN OPERATING PERMIT TO THE SWEDISH SALON, LOCATED NEXT TO 
A SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A chain-link fence separates the windows of the Swedish Salon massage parlor 
on North Garey Avenue in Pomona from the curious eyes of children at Abraham 
Lincoln Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen parents and students from the newly expanded school stood on one 
side of the fence on a recent morning, holding picket signs and shouting, "Go 
away so we can play!" Cold eyes stared at the parlor and the talk was of 
pornographic magazines found crumpled in the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side sat the masseuses, who describe themselves as working 
mothers who are sick of being portrayed as prostitutes as they try to earn an 
honest living. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind closed doors, meanwhile, attorneys for both parties have spent most of 
the past two weeks arguing the legality of the parlor in a still-unfinished 
hearing that will determine if the city can deny the Swedish Salon an operating 
permit and shut down the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish Salon opened at 1293 N. Garey Ave. in 1969. The school, built in 
1937, was still on the other side of the block. But community objections grew 
over the years as the school added parking lots and playgrounds and moved 
closer and closer to the massage parlor, said Julian Villasenor, administrative 
director of elementary school services and programs for the Pomona Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 When the parlor applied to renew its business license in 1989, the city 
investigated, found several minor violations dealing with building codes and 
massage licenses and denied the request, said Roger Colvin, Pomona's deputy 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The parlor's owner, Herschel H. Jennings, fixed the problems, got his 
masseuses licensed by the city and appealed the denial to city officials. 
Scheduling conflicts have put the appeal in legal limbo for the past five years 
until the hearings began March 29, Colvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings said that before 1989, the salon had operated for nearly 20 years 
with no violations. Police have never reported any illegal activity there. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials and parents say they have collected pornographic 
magazines and packaged, unopened condoms that have been dropped over the fence. 
Parents complain that their children see the women who work at the salon 
wearing provocative clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Council members have made no bones about their desire to kick the 
parlor out of town. Mayor Eddie Cortez has gone on TV denouncing the salon, and 
Councilwoman Nell Soto, who has had five grandchildren attend Lincoln, has 
protested along with the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is determined to get rid of it one way or the other," Soto said. 
"We are determined to find some loophole . . . we want him to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Soto's desire to see the salon go was echoed by salon owner 
Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be more than happy to sell the property," said Jennings, noting that 
the city backed out of a deal to buy the land two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings wants the right to relocate to the site of his choice or get the 
right price for his land before he gives up his salon. "You can't take away 
someone's license just because you don't like them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But parent Cyndi Guerra sees it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see these women coming to work in short skirts with plunging necklines . . 
. it's a bad influence on the children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women in question -- who were all modestly dressed the day of the protest 
-- are bewildered by the moral indignation of the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 One masseuse said: "Look, I have two kids in the district. (Another masseuse) 
volunteers at her school. And we're tired of our kids getting flak from the 
other kids."

 Mayoral and council candidates agree that the Azusa City Council must present 
a united front to improve the city's declining image and attract new business. 
But when it comes to how to achieve that, they are worlds apart.

 Councilmen John Dangleis, Anthony Naranjo and Stephen J. Alexander are running 
for mayor now that Eugene F. Moses has stepped down after 10 years to run for 
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten others, including two former councilmen, are battling for the council 
seats vacated by two of the mayoral contenders in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to change the city's image and be more receptive to investors. . . 
. The council has to stop looking like a bunch of bitching kids," said 
Dangleis, 62, who spent 14 years as a city administrator, first in Azusa and 
then in Carson, before becoming a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's image problem stems in part from such matters as poor air quality 
and old-fashioned architecture. It has been compounded by nearly a decade of 
political infighting among council members and a City Hall with a reputation 
for being less-than-receptive to business concerns. Together, these factors 
have deterred many businesses from locating in Azusa, a community of 41,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangleis, a one-term councilman, said he would promote the city to investors 
through a public relations push and a more business-friendly City Hall. He said 
he would maintain control of the volatile council meetings, which he said have 
worsened the city's image, as have the council's attempts to close the Azusa 
Rock quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarry has concerned environmentalists, who fear its operation may be 
damaging the mountainside where it is located. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander sees the quarry at Fish Canyon as part of Azusa's poor image and 
would like to restrict its operation because of the dust it releases. 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-year-old attorney, Alexander said taxes and what he terms "redevelopment 
giveaways" are hurting the city. He opposes an assessment that was added to 
electric bills to pay for fire service. 
</P>
<P>
 The third mayoral candidate, Naranjo, 38, a two-term councilman who has 
attended council meetings since childhood, said he would encourage investment 
in the community through promoting youth and senior citizens' programs, 
adequately staffing the Police Department and making City Hall more fiscally 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Naranjo has been the subject of two failed recalls because of his support of 
the Azusa Rock quarry and in this election is the only mayoral candidate to 
have received campaign contributions from its owners.  
</P>
<P>
 Dangleis, too, is haunted by his past. In 1987 he left the Carson 
administrator's post while under investigation by the district attorney's 
office for his role in awarding a $300,000-a-year insurance contract to an 
agency owned by a friend and business associate. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his contract expired, the council learned Dangleis had apparently not 
disclosed $1,200 in income from work he had done for the insurance company that 
got the city business. Dangleis denied any wrongdoing. The city put him on paid 
leave until his contract expired; the probe also was dropped at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The council candidates are: 
</P>
<P>
 Don Flowers, 51, Planning Commission chairman and building contractor, who 
wants to attract new businesses and retain existing ones. He likes the idea of 
hiring a public relations firm to promote the city. He favors the quarry's 
continued operation and has accepted $510 in campaign contributions from its 
owners. No other council candidates have received money from the quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Claro Perez, 46, who owns a cash register business, is campaigning for 
recreational programs for youth, health programs for seniors and job training 
to reduce unemployment. He said more after-school programs are needed to keep 
youth away from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Romy Torres Pangilinan, did not return calls or provide a campaign statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry L. Stemrich, 62, a former councilman and retired businessman, said he 
would increase police presence on the streets by placing paid volunteers in 
police squad cars. He survived two recalls while in office for his support of 
the quarry and was a leader in the fight against malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando L. Camarena, 47, a former councilman and a national auction group 
executive, is a fiscal conservative who said he would use his negotiation 
experience to aid redevelopment deals. Camarena favors tighter regulation of 
the quarry and wants to see more Americans of Mexican descent on the council, 
in a city where 53% of the population is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Moritz-Beebe, 31, a real estate appraiser, said teamwork and 
communication at City Hall must be improved. She wants Azusa city staff to 
treat residents with a customer-service approach. She said little can be done 
about the quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Morales, 62, a city historical commissioner, is the town's proud gadfly 
and a war veterans' leader. He opposes the assessment on electric bills, wants 
to protect mobile home residents from rent increases and favors stricter 
regulation of the quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Rubio Martinez, 48, a clerk at a home building supply store, is a 
community activist involved in many local service groups, from PTA to the 
police chief's committee on crime. She opposes the assessment fees and said new 
leadership is needed to redevelop the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Nine, 58, a real estate agent, favors a public relations drive to 
promote the city to outsiders and said his experience in real estate would be 
an asset. 
</P>
<P>
 David O. Hardison, 47, owner of a building materials business, advocates the 
construction of more single-family homes in the city on unused land. He said 
new residents would attract retailers. He wants to put an end to political 
infighting and calls the quarry a false issue because he believes the city does 
not have the legal authority to close it.

AT LEAST DODGERS GET HITS; BASEBALL: BUT ONLY FOUR OF THEM, AS BRAVES WIN IN 
10TH, 2-1, FOR SIXTH IN A ROW. GROSS STRIKES OUT 11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nine great innings of pitching aside, Saturday's game came down to a throw and 
a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi threw it, but Mike Piazza couldn't catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting to rest an impressive pitching duel, pinch-runner Mike Kelly scored on 
Jeff Blauser's single in the 10th as the Atlanta Braves slid past the Dodgers, 
2-1, before a crowd of 42,996 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasted in the effort was an 11-strikeout performance by Dodger starter Kevin 
Gross, who bore no signs of shoulder problems in a splendid seven-inning 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Maddux, the two-time Cy Young Award winner, outlasted Gross to improve to 
2-0. Maddux gave up four hits in nine innings, with four strikeouts and one 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg McMichael pitched a scoreless 10th to pick up his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell took the loss for the Dodgers, and it would be tough to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the 10th, Mark Lemke slapped a single to left off Worrell. 
After pinch-hitter Tony Tarasco lined to right, Deion Sanders singled to 
center. Kelly, running for Lemke, stopped at second. 
</P>
<P>
 Blauser then dropped an opposite-field single to right. Kelly, running at the 
crack of the bat, charged home. Mondesi fielded the ball on a short hop and 
fired a strike home on one wicked bounce, the ball handcuffing Piazza, who 
could not make the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The throw had beaten Kelly to the plate. But, all told, it would add up to 
another Dodger loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, still mired in their hitting slump, went down in order in the 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
 One night after being no-hit, and batting .138 as a team, the Dodgers managed 
only four hits off Atlanta pitching, three by Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Braves improved to 6-0. The Dodgers fell to 2-3. The 
only consolation was that Atlanta no longer resides in the National League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving up a run during a shaky first inning, Gross settled down and 
turned downright dominating in his 1994 debut. The question going in concerned 
tenderness that has plagued Gross' pitching shoulder most of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Gross was overpowering. He gave up four hits and hit one batter. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the eighth time Gross has struck out 10 or more in his career, and 
it was the most he has recorded since striking out 12 Chicago Cubs in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross gave up only one hit after the first. He did not surrender another after 
a leadoff bunt single to Sanders in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 There were rumblings this spring that Gross might lose his spot in the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hung with me and here I am," Gross said after his performance. "I don't 
look at this as a wasted effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross would hurt his cause only at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed a great opportunity to help himself in the bottom of the fifth, 
when, with one out and runners on first and third, he grounded into an 
inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux, in turn, would match Gross through seven and then some on a chilly 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "A perfect night to pitch," Maddux said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scoring opportunities were squandered. Brett Butler walked on a 3-2 
pitch to open the ninth, but was erased when Mike Piazza grounded into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, after Mondesi singled and stole second, Jose Offerman and Mitch 
Webster popped meekly to third and Delino DeShields flied to left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves stranded Sanders at third in the third. In the eighth, they had 
runners on first and third with two out against reliever Gary Wayne, but were 
denied when Ryan Klesko grounded into a force play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves scored in the first inning when leadoff man Sanders singled, stole 
second, advanced to third on Blauser's broken-bat single and scored on Fred 
McGriff's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been a lot worse for Gross, who escaped relatively unharmed 
after giving up three hits while facing six batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Notions of consecutive no-hitters thrown against the Dodgers were dashed when 
Tim Wallach singled to left with one out in the second. It was Wallach's first 
hit of the season after an 0-for-13 start.

LEITER IS ANGELS' REAL WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Leiter stood helplessly on the mound Saturday afternoon, his body 
trembling with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter could think only of Ryan, wondering now if he should even be pitching. 
His 9-month-old son had died only five days earlier, and maybe his friends were 
right, he should take time to grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost felt guilty warming up," Leiter said, " 'Is this too soon? What am I 
doing?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept thinking, 'I wish to God Ryan was here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There was no one on the field Saturday who could comprehend the pain Leiter 
endured. Then again, perhaps no one could experience the same fulfillment in 
the Angels' 6-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to win today," Leiter said, "more than I ever wanted to win in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, who struggled the first couple of innings with his emotions, left the 
game trailing 2-1 after six innings. The Brewers expanded the lead to 4-1 
before the Angels tied it with three runs in the eighth, then scored two in the 
ninth on back-to-back, two-out singles by Jim Edmonds and Eduardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds produced the game-winning hit, Mike Butcher got the victory and Joe 
Grahe the save, but the Angels said that there was no bigger hero than Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can possibly imagine what he went through out there today," said Angel 
reliever Craig Lefferts, who has four kids of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went out there today, I prayed for peace for him. I just wanted God to 
give him peace to do what he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter's wife, Allison, and their 3-year-old son, Mark Jr., were sitting in 
the stands. They traveled together to Milwaukee on Thursday night, not bearing 
to be apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time were all together, we were at the ballpark Monday," Allison 
said. "The four of us just went out and sat in the stands at Anaheim Stadium. 
No one else was around. It was so peaceful, so beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Ryan was here for a reason, and it was not to rip our family apart or 
make us miserable people. It was to bring us together. Ryan will always be with 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an angel watching over us now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan died of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, a children's form of Lou Gehrig's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult aspect of the day was not pitching to the Brewers, but 
knowing that to concentrate, he had to shut down the memories of Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of going through the motions the first couple of hitters," Leiter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started getting upset at myself, telling myself, 'You can't let everybody 
down.' I'll be thinking about him my whole life, but I can't be doing this on 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go on, you have to focus on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 While Leiter's mind was wandering Saturday, the memory of Friday evening 
provided the most comfort. He started to think of his son, Marky, who kept him 
awake most of the night with a stomachache. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, worried, wasn't able to fall asleep until 1:15, and Marky woke up at 
3:50. Leiter stayed up and rubbed Marky's stomach, finally falling asleep at 
5:15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh, this is great. Unbelievable. What else can go wrong. Throw it 
all at us. Dish it out, we'll keep battling.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I just looked at each other, and started laughing. We thought, 
'Boy, if this was the biggest problem in life, it would be great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter allowed six baserunners the first two innings, but he retired the side 
in order in the third inning and prevented anyone from reaching third base 
again until Dave Nilsson's wind-blown home run in the sixth. He wasn't the 
winning pitcher, but the Angels said it was one of the greatest performances 
they ever witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he did today was totally unbelievable," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina 
said. "This will be a day that none of us will ever forget."

THE MASTERS; LEHMAN PROVES HE'S NO LEMON; GOLF: NON-WINNER MAKES 50-FOOT PUTT 
ON NO. 16 AND SHOOTS 69 FOR ONE-SHOT LEAD OVER OLAZABAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something is wrong with this picture. Here, on the eve of golf's annual 
coronation in one of its most prestigious tournaments, stands a commoner. A 
golfer who was so down on his luck that he accepted a job as a club pro at Wood 
Ranch in Simi Valley. A man who has never won on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as Tom Lehman will find out today, there are 18 more holes to play. 
So, maybe this picture is nothing more than a playful illusion, created for the 
amusement of those who worship Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman posted a three-under-par 69 on Saturday to give him a seven-under-par 
209 and a one-stroke lead after three rounds of the Masters. Sitting 
dangerously in second is Jose Maria Olazabal, who equaled Lehman with the day's 
low round of 69. Two shots back is first- and second-round leader Larry Mize, 
who shot an even-par 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite is another shot back at 212, tied with Jim McGovern and Ian 
Baker-Finch at three under. Tom Watson is alone at two-under, ending the list 
of golfers who seemingly have a chance at this year's green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointing rounds were turned in by Greg Norman, whose 75 puts him at 215, 
and Chip Beck, whose 75 has him at one-over 217. Dan Forsman, who shot a 66 on 
Friday and was one stroke out of the lead, shot a 76 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman played on the tour in the early 1980s with little success. He knocked 
around every imaginable mini-tour there was. "When you're in Riverton, Wyoming, 
you know you're in Riverton, Wyoming," he said of those days. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, he was interviewed for the job as golf coach at the 
University of Minnesota, his alma mater. "I probably would have taken the job, 
except they wanted me to rent cross-country skis at the pro shop in the 
winter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he accepted the job as pro at Wood Ranch but stayed for only eight 
months, picking up his pursuit of making it big on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman has never won a tour event, with his best finish a second last year at 
the Hardee's Classic in Coal Valley, Ill. Last year, his final-round 68 at the 
Masters left him a four-way tie for third, six shots behind winner Bernhard 
Langer. Today will be the first time he has been in the final group to tee off 
on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what he knew about Lehman, Olazabal said: "You don't need to know a 
lot about a person shooting seven under, because that's all you need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman will get known a lot sooner if he has any more putts like his 50-footer 
with the 20-foot break on the par-three 16th. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was walking up to the green, I started to think about 1991, when Mark 
McCumber made that same putt," Lehman said. "Tom Watson has made that putt, 
too. . . . I was just trying to get it up on the ledge and let it come back 
down a bit. Obviously, I wasn't trying to make it. I just wanted to get it 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 Close in this case was the bottom of the cup. It was one of five birdies he 
had on the day, three of them on par fives. On the 500-yard 15th hole, he was 
on the back edge with a driver and nine-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hole was downhill, downwind, down everything," he said trying to downplay 
the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman had only two bogeys, one on the treacherous par-three 12th, when he 
lipped out a putt, and on the 18th, when he missed a seven-footer for par after 
coming out of a greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 His bogey on the final hole left him a bit disappointed, but overall he said 
he had nothing to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times today when I was walking up to the green and people were 
cheering that I was getting a little water in my eye," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal had a chance to lead, but on the 13th, the par five that ends "Amen 
corner," he hit his second shot short into the green and it spun back into 
Rae's Creek. The bogey dropped Olazabal into a tie for first. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal had two spectacular holes, getting an eagle on the eighth after 
hitting a three-iron 240 yards to within six feet of the hole. He also knocked 
the ball to within two feet on the 10th hole for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind was causing havoc for the third consecutive day with gusts up to 25 
m.p.h. Olazabal thought it worked to his benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're used to playing in similar windy conditions in Europe," he said. "The 
more you play in it, the more you get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mize, he of the 140-foot chip shot in 1987 to win, likes his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a tough day out there," Mize said. "I was up and down, so I'm pleased 
to have a 72. I just wanted to put myself in position to win on Sunday, and I 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Mize also rationalized losing the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just as soon be leading, but I don't mind being two back. Leading can be 
a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The person most likely to come out of the pack on the final day is 44-year-old 
Tom Kite, who has shot steady rounds of 69-72-71. If it wasn't for a misplayed 
approach to the 17th green, he would have had a bogey-free round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good solid round with not a lot of the putts going in," Kite said. "I 
burned the edges all day, yet I'd be hard-pressed to tell you that I putted 
poorly today." 
</P>
<P>
 Kite believes his experience could work in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little better than I used to be at handling the pressure and accepting 
missed putts," he said. "Winning the U.S. Open (in 1992) makes everything 
easier. Knowing that I won it and won it under difficult circumstances makes a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most difficult circumstance that Lehman will face today is walking 
up to the first tee and realizing he has a chance to win the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who thought a kid from Minnesota would be leading?" Lehman asked. "I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did anyone else.

LAKERS GET KNOCKED FOR A LOOP; PRO BASKETBALL: PLAYOFF HOPES WANE AFTER 112-104 
COLLAPSE AGAINST PORTLAND GIVES NUGGETS 4 1/2-GAME EDGE FOR FINAL BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This was no Coop-a-loop, the high-flying basketball shows from days gone by. 
This was Michael Cooper's new gig, temporary as it was, being turned into a 
flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 His coaching debut, serving as the interim to the interim while Coach Magic 
Johnson was in Michigan for his high school all-star game, looked great early. 
But the Lakers and Cooper went under in the second half, dragged down by 
scoring 39 points and shooting 36.4% to eventually lose to the Portland Trail 
Blazers, 112-104, before 12,888 at Memorial Coliseum and fall 4 1/2 games 
behind Denver with eight games left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually in a year you have four seasons," Cooper said. "It seems like we had 
a good summer season. We played well in the first half and we had a lead. But 
we went from summer to winter real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 That winter was also the Lakers' fall, when they trailed only 89-85 with 8:59 
remaining and then fell off the pace. Five turnovers in eight possessions tends 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a big game last night, and that took a lot out of us emotionally," 
said Tony Smith, who led the Lakers with 18 points. "Tonight, we played well 
the first half and knew they would make a second-half run at us. It was just a 
matter of whether we could withstand it. We couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 So Cooper is 0-1 and waiting for his next chance, even if that's not what the 
pinch-hitting assignment was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is like anything," he said. "I'm just taking over for Earvin, 
who had a prior engagement. Why I was chosen, I don't know. But we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 If this was, in fact, a chance for Cooper to get his feet wet with an eye 
toward the future, he got a handful after the Lakers' loss to Denver on Friday 
at the Forum in the biggest game of the season. They were down, and Cooper knew 
it.

 "You can see it," he said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Come tipoff, though, you couldn't see it. When the Trail Blazers went 3:08 
without a field goal, a stand that made defensive specialist Cooper proud, the 
Lakers converted a stretch of that into a 9-0 run and a 48-37 lead. The cushion 
stayed around 11 points much of the rest of the second quarter, peaking at 12 
at 60-48, before Portland closed to 65-56 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 3:44 of the second half, the entire lead was gone, having been turned 
into a 69-67 advantage for the Trail Blazers after a 13-2 rally. Cooper had 
already called two timeouts in the quarter, one a 20-second. That helped 
stopped the bleeding before the Lakers got down by more than three points in 
the third period. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel on Friday became only the fifth Los Angeles Laker to score 1,000 
points as a rookie, joining impressive company: Jerry West, Magic Johnson, Norm 
Nixon and James Worthy. West holds the record for first-year players, at 1,389 
points. Van Exel can't catch him, but went into the Trail Blazer game needing 
only 32 points in the final nine outings to pass Worthy and 107 to pass Nixon 
for No. 3. "I haven't really thought about it much," he said. The record Van 
Exel does have his eye on is the NBA mark for three-pointers by a rookie. He 
began the night second to Orlando's Dennis Scott, needing 15 to pass. . . . 
Kurt Rambis missed his second game in a row because of a strained rib muscle. .

 Karl Malone scored 15 of his 25 points in the decisive third quarter Saturday 
night as the Utah Jazz won consecutive games for the first time in a month, 
defeating the Clippers, 128-104. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Chambers, John Stockton and Tyrone Corbin scored 20 points each for the 
Jazz, who had failed to win two straight games since the end of their 10-game 
winning streak on March 8. The Jazz defeated Dallas, 99-82, Thursday night and 
won the season series from the Clippers, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dehere and Ron Harper led the Clippers with 17 points each, and 
Dominique Wilkins had 16. It was the ninth loss in the last 11 games for the 
Clippers (26-48). 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 59-58, after Gary Grant made a 16-foot jumper, the Jazz responded 
with a 15-1 run to lead, 74-59, with 7:14 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone scored seven consecutive points later in the quarter, extending Utah's 
lead to 86-67. After a 21-foot jumper by Wilkins, Malone made two free throws 
and Corbin made a basket to give Utah a 90-69 lead, its largest to that point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers outscored the Jazz, 9-2, through the end of the quarter to close 
within 14, but they came no closer. Utah's largest lead was the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said Utah's defense and transition game in the second 
half were the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stepped up their defense a notch, and we weren't quite getting the same 
shots we were in the first half," said Weiss, whose team, 41-41 last season 
under Larry Brown, might not win 30 games this season. "They do a great job of 
picking you apart, and the smallest mistake, they capitalize on." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah tied its highest point total of the season. The Jazz made 50 of 87 
field-goal attempts (57%), much better than their season average of 47.1%, and 
far better than their 42% clip during a recent slump during which they lost 
nine of 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers made 35 of 75 attempts (46.7%), but were four for 19 from 
three-point range. Wilkins and Harper were a combined 11 for 27 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the blowout, Utah Coach Jerry Sloan was angry about his team's 
first-half play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised our fans stayed around and watched us after that. It was a 
pretty poor exhibition of basketball," said Sloan. "We didn't get back and 
defend them. We just exchanged baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't trying to defend them at all. In the second half, we started 
running the floor better, because of what we were doing on the other end."

 The Birmingham Barons will be traveling in style this year, thanks to Michael 
Jordan. No more 12-hour trips on the double-A team's old bus. Jordan is buying 
a new one for the team -- a $350,000 luxury vehicle similar to one used by 
touring rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
 It has 35 reclining seats, six television sets and a VCR, and a lounge area 
with wet bar in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the latest thing," said Joe Thrasher, president of the Thrasher Bros. 
Bus Co., which has provided the Barons' charter service for the past 14 years. 
"It's like stepping into a new airplane. It just never leaves the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Jordan: Chicago White Sox outfielder Tim Raines put together a list of 
reasons why spring training "was different with Michael Jordan around." It 
included: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tickets were scalped for batting practice, and our outfielders are being 
taught to stick out their tongues while making a catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the last California native to win the Masters? 
</P>
<P>
 Cluck cluck: Max Patkin, the "Clown Prince of Baseball," refused to perform in 
an all-star game at St. Petersburg, Fla., after "the Chicken" -- also hired to 
perform -- refused to let him do his act before the bottom of the fourth 
inning.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what he's complaining about," said Ted Giannoulas, alias the 
Chicken. "All great performers -- the Sinatras, the Streisands -- go on last." 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Patkin: "I'm so angry. I'd like to eat that little chicken for lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Hot snack: Unusual things seem to happen to pitcher Curtis Leskanic of the 
Colorado Rockies. For example, the hotel where Leskanic and his spring 
roommate, catcher Jayhawk Owens, were staying in Tucson serves complimentary 
popcorn. One night, the machine was empty and Leskanic was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those old-fashioned machines with the big heater," Owens said. 
"Curtis got it going, but he couldn't figure how to dump it. So, all the 
popcorn caught on fire and the smoke alarm went off in the hotel. I think we 
burned up the machine." 
</P>
<P>
 White lightning: Paul Runyan, 85, two-time PGA champion, recalled playing in 
the first Masters tournament in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good corn whiskey," Runyan told Jo-Ann Barnas of the Kansas City Star. "It 
was a fun sort of a tournament. They had 50 gallons of it and ran out by 
mid-morning of the third day of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was inebriated, but we had fun." 
</P>

 Fish story: After being released by the Oakland Athletics, veteran relief 
pitcher Goose Gossage said:

CANADIANS FASTEST OF THE FAST AT PHOENIX; INDY CARS: TRACY HAS THE POLE WITH 
RECORD SPEED. MANSELL ISN'T COMFORTABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The speeds keep going up at Phoenix International Raceway -- despite efforts 
by Indy car officials to slow them down -- and not everyone, including 
defending series champion Nigel Mansell, is happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Paul Tracy, one of Roger Penske's team of Marlboro drivers, won the 
pole Saturday for today's Slick 50 200 with a record lap of 176.266 m.p.h. 
around the one-mile oval. In all, seven drivers, including Mansell, bettered 
the track record of 172.804 set last year by Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not comfortable here," Mansell said. "That's not a reassuring thought for 
a race driver before a race, but here, if anything goes wrong, you are in the 
wall. I know exactly what can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Mansell was preparing to make his oval racing debut at 
Phoenix, he crashed during practice and suffered a concussion and back injuries 
that required surgery. The British former Formula One world champion returned 
to win four consecutive oval races en route to winning the PPG Cup 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Saturday, Mansell crashed again late in the final practice session, 
slowing in the third turn after coming up quickly on another car. He appeared 
to simply lose control in the fourth turn, spinning up toward the wall and 
hitting Jacques Villeneuve's car as the 23-year-old Canadian tried to slip 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Both drivers escaped injury, but Mansell will probably start today's race in 
his backup car. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't compare this track to any of the other ovals," Mansell said. "It is 
so much faster. We are close to making three laps every minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy needed only 20.4 seconds to complete his record lap. Earlier in the day, 
during practice, he was even quicker, with an unofficial lap at 178.104. 
</P>
<P>
 "They changed the rules to reduce the down force through the corners and slow 
us down, but it had a reverse effect," Tracy explained. "We were going 180 down 
the straightaways last year, but with less down force we are up to 193." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell added: "The result is that our entry speeds (into the corners) are so 
much higher. Because of the speeds and the banking, there aren't too many lines 
out there, and there'll be a lot of cars out there tomorrow going awfully 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy was joined on the front row by countryman Villeneuve, making what 
officials said was probably the first all-Canadian front row in Indy car 
history. Villeneuve ran 176.110, with Mansell third at 175.478. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve is the son of the late Formula One champion Gilles Villeneuve, one 
of Canada's most revered sports heroes. Jacques' uncle, also named Jacques, won 
the pole at Phoenix in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the first one out, so I didn't know what to expect," said Villeneuve, 
whose car was deemed reparable after the crash with Mansell. "The car felt 
great right out of the pits, and I just had to trust it. Tomorrow's a 
completely different thing, because with 30 cars going at the same time, the 
aerodynamics will change the car quite a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Tracy, Villeneuve and Mansell, the track record was bettered by 
defending race champion Mario Andretti (174.932), Raul Boesel (173.357), 
Emerson Fittipaldi (173.346) and Robby Gordon (173.113). 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti, who returned to Indy cars this season after a disappointing 
year in Formula One and won the opening race last month in Australia, could 
squeeze a lap of only 171.204 from his Reynard. He will start 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti won the Phoenix race in 1986.

MARTIN PROCEEDS WITHOUT CAUTION AND HANDS THE VICTORY TO GREEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Green was awarded a bizarre victory Saturday in the Goody's 250 when 
leader Mark Martin mistakenly pulled off the track 300 yards before he was to 
take the checkered flag under caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life, I think," said Martin, 
who dominated the Busch Grand National event at Bristol International Raceway, 
leading 195 of the 250 laps."What can I say? I thought it was over." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin was about 10 car lengths ahead of Green when the final caution flag 
flew after Robert Pressley slammed into the third-turn wall on lap 246. 
</P>
<P>
 As the field came out of the fourth turn and the flag man reached for the 
checkered flag, Martin ducked down out of the racing groove and headed for 
victory lane. 
</P>
<P>
 A stunned Green kept his Chevrolet in line and took the checkered flag at 35 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only lap he led. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been pulling for David Green, wanting him to win a race," Martin said, 
"but not like that."

 Billy Tubbs said he was ready for a change, so he is leaving Oklahoma after 14 
seasons to become basketball coach at Texas Christian.

NBA ROUNDUP; MAXWELL GETS VOTE AT HOUSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sellout crowd in Houston came to watch Hakeem Olajuwon against David 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 They let it be known early that Olajuwon was the people's choice with shouts 
of "MVP, MVP," Saturday, but at the end of Houston's 100-89 victory over San 
Antonio, they were talking about Vernon Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
 His 27 points led the Rockets into a two-game lead in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell's role and the victory seemed to go hand in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to the Rockets is, if their guards are making their shots, they are a 
different team," Spur Coach John Lucas said. "Their guards are a little like 
ours. If they hit the first couple of shots, their confidence goes way up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Smith added 22 points and seven assists as Houston's guards outscored 
the Spurs' backcourt starters, 49-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon and the Spurs' Robinson were saddled with foul trouble, each having 
five over the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon finished with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Robinson, after scoring only 
one point in the first quarter, led the Spurs with 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 127, Philadelphia 122 -- Larry Johnson scored 20 points and Muggsy 
Bogues had 19 points and 13 assists as the Hornets won in overtime at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 117, Washington 103 -- Stacey Augmon made 12 consecutive shots and 
scored 26 points for the Hawks at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 125, Miami 105 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored the Magic's first five 
points in a 14-4 fourth-quarter spurt after the Heat had tied the score, 88-88, 
at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 117, Minnesota 105 -- Chris Mullin scored a season-high 29 points 
and Latrell Sprewell added 17 as the Warriors won at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 125, Milwaukee 99 -- B.J. Armstrong scored the first five points and 
the Bulls scored the first 15 in blowing out the Bucks at Chicago.

 That was fun, wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers' playoff drive was like Jerry Buss' last-ditch attempt to get Magic 
Johnson to coach his team: exciting, but a longshot. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all the more electric because Johnson proved to be a natural, because 
the boring, sullen Lakers responded as if someone had waved a wand over them 
and the fans returned almost as if they had never left. Opponents fell like 
tenpins right up until Denver's baby bull, Rodney Rogers, trampled their bubble 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the diversion of a race suddenly gone, a question intrudes: 
</P>
<P>
 What now? 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, it was as if Kim Basinger had agreed to marry Buss' frog on the 
hope of turning him into a prince. What if Kim backs out, instead, and lets the 
frog go back to dating?

 Indeed, Johnson acknowledged last week what everyone around the Forum had 
guessed -- he had taken the job for a month only as a favor to Buss and had no 
intention of staying beyond this season. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he seemed to be wavering. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was going to be in and out, and it still might be," Johnson said. "Now 
it's going to be emotional, no matter what happens. I never thought it would 
be, but you get attached." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the week, however, he was backing away. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are the chances of me being back?" he said before Friday's loss to the 
Nuggets. "More so the other way -- that I won't be." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says he won't decide until the season ends, but it's up to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The ownership issue? 
</P>
<P>
 No problema. Buss says he will sell him a chunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry West? 
</P>
<P>
 No problema. West looked like a man being forced to go along and, indeed, had 
his own agenda for replacing Randy Pfund, preferring to wait for summer to see 
if they could get a hot replacement, reportedly Kentucky's Rick Pitino, Kansas' 
Roy Williams or Cincinnati's Bob Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
 West is said to have had one fear about the interim appointment -- what do we 
do for an encore after we've built up everyone's expectations if he doesn't 
stay? -- but was part of the effort to bring Johnson back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry West was in on these discussions from day one," says Johnson's agent, 
Lon Rosen. "He pushed for it as much as Jerry Buss did. He (West) wants Earvin 
to be the coach of this team, and you can see why." 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one issue: What does Johnson want? 
</P>
<P>
 Problema . 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching, as Johnson learned it from Pat Riley, isn't a lifestyle, it's a 
life, and Johnson likes the one he has. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have gone back to practicing as they did under Riley, long and 
hard, with Johnson carrying a schedule of drills on a doubled-over sheet of 
paper, as Riley did. Magic worries about every detail, such as reminding 
everyone to set their clocks ahead, although he has yet to get into the music 
they play at the Forum or when the Laker Girls dance, as his mentor did. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakers are required to wear jackets and ties on the charter now. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakers are again required to remember they're Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they've been on a honeymoon. Vlade Divac is as unlikely to maintain 
his recent 70% shooting percentage as Elden Campbell is to keep his new 
17-point average, but it was a new experience to see the fire in Vlade's eyes, 
or Elden with both of his open. 
</P>
<P>
 If Johnson leaves, he will at least have shown what a top coach can mean, even 
in a rebuilding program. The pressure will be on to find another big-timer, 
someone like Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-timers, however, run on their own schedules and have options galore. The 
line of NBA teams that want Pitino goes around the block, and some have stars 
like Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a brave, desperate, risky thing Buss is trying, with a tremendous up side 
and a depressing down side. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, things aren't boring any more at the Forum. STAY IN SCHOOL 
(NOT YOU GUYS) 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone expected another big underclass move into the draft, but the recent 
announcements of freshmen Rashard Griffith of Wisconsin and Dontonio Wingfield 
of Cincinnati were surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are recruiting these kids with scare stories about a rookie cap. 
Actually, a rookie cap is a longshot; the NBA will have all it can do to close 
its salary-cap breach without asking the players for more give-backs. 
</P>
<P>
 What do the kids know? What do they care with talk of $50-million deals 
everywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 Wingfield is 6 feet 9 and 250 pounds and, with his youth and unbridled talent, 
reminds people of Shawn Kemp. Unlike Kemp, whose indiscretions were penny-ante 
and whose attitude was good, Wingfield has been getting into trouble with 
coaches and other authority figures for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll probably go from the end of the lottery to the 20s, which is a sad 
commentary," an agent said. "This is not Shawn Kemp." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-11, 265-pound Griffith hasn't withdrawn from school but is home in 
Chicago rather than on campus in Madison, Wis. Anything but a problem child, 
he's upset at Coach Stu Jackson for bringing him along slowly. Jackson 
reportedly went to Chicago to see him last week but returned to Madison without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith isn't the second coming of Kareem, but he's strong and precocious. 
After meeting Johnson at a camp last summer, he has his heart set on the Lakers 
but will have to get past the Mavericks, Bullets, Kings, Bucks, Pistons and 
Timberwolves, who figure to pick first and need a center. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Wingfield, who shouldn't have been in school in the first place, 
Griffith ought to buy a good insurance policy and stay. He has things to learn 
about basketball, not to mention himself, and no one should be in a hurry to 
truncate his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't bet he won't come, though. Soon he'll be doing those "Stay in School" 
ads with a bunch of other guys who never saw their junior years. HOW LOW CAN 
THEY GO? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks' losing streaks of 20, 17 and 16 account for 78% of the 
schedule, but last week's victory over Sacramento gave them a total of nine, 
tying them with the 9-73 76ers of 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least 20 years from now," Sean Rooks 
</P>
<P>
 said, "the media won't be looking me up, asking me how it felt to play on the 
worst team of all time." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Dallas, with consecutive 70-loss seasons, would post a new standard 
for sustained incompetence. Coach Quinn Buckner is hanging by a thread, but 
owner Don Carter, who circles to the beat of a different drummer, will probably 
bring him back. Carter wants to rehire Dick Motta, despite Motta's feud with 
the front-office people who canned him, as a consultant to help with the lower 
picks in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chances are," Carter said, "that an idiot can make that first pick." 
</P>
<P>
 And has. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets, 6 1/2 games ahead of the Lakers on March 27, ended a four-game 
nose dive with victories over the SuperSonics and Lakers, but they're young and 
volatile on all levels. "I guarantee you," General Manager Bernie Bickerstaff 
said, zinging point guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, "if we had someone in the 
backcourt who understands the game, we wouldn't have any problems." . . . 
Talking about the young and volatile, impetuous Charlotte owner George Shinn 
almost gave emotional Allan Bristow a vote of confidence, saying he remains his 
coach "on this day" and adding: "If something comes along that's best for the 
team, I have a responsibility to do what's best for the franchise." . . . More 
trouble: Washington's Wes Unseld, an old favorite of owner Abe Pollin, is 
expected to be booted upstairs and replaced as coach by 76er General Manager 
Jimmy Lynam, an old friend of Bullet General Manager John Nash. Kevin 
Loughery's three-year contract is up in Miami, and Heat management is keeping 
an ominous silence. . . . You know your program is losing steam when CBA guys 
don't want to report: Lester Conner said when the Pistons got him from the 
Sioux City (Iowa) Sky Force: "I have mixed feelings coming here. I may be on a 
10-day contract, but I'm giving them a 10-day tryout." . . . Charles Smith, the 
Knicks' $3.8-million-a-year non-producer, was due to return from the injured 
list but reported that his sore knee hurt after a shootaround, leading to a 
confrontation with Coach Pat Riley in a Madison Square Garden hallway. Riley 
wouldn't comment. "It was a delicate situation," Smith said. "We've put it 
behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his glowing smile and moose's physique, Chris Webber is a problem for 
Warrior Coach Don Nelson, who wants him to be more physical but must tread 
lightly around him for fear of straining their relationship. "I'm not a 
center," Webber protested. "I'm very uncomfortable playing that position. The 
problem is, we don't have many big men, so I'm usually checking centers like 
Hakeem (Olajuwon) and the rest of them. It's tough going through that night 
after night." . . . Bad choice for a comparison, CW: Actually, at 6-10 and 260, 
Webber is the same size as Olajuwon. . . . The free-agent crop took a hit when 
Buck Williams unexpectedly re-signed with the Trail Blazers. Williams would 
have made a useful power forward for the Hornets or the Magic, so Horace 
Grant's value just went up even further. 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. Armstrong, upset over a quarrel with Bull Coach Phil Jackson, said he had 
reached "a low point in my career" despite being selected as an All-Star 
starter and signing a long-term contract. Jackson, when asked if Armstrong has 
a beef with him, said: "B.J. does not eat beef. B.J. is a vegetarian. I don't 
think he has any beef at all." . . . New Bull Luc Longley, to teammate Bill 
Cartwright: "In Minnesota, when we'd complain on the bench about not getting a 
call, we'd always say, 'If we're the Chicago Bulls, we would have gotten that 
call.' " Cartwright replied: "Yeah, we say the same thing now."

GRETZKY DOWN, OUT AND SO ARE THE KINGS; PRO HOCKEY: STAR CENTER WILL MISS AT 
LEAST ONE GAME AFTER TWISTING LEFT KNEE IN AWKWARD FALL IN 4-3 LOSS TO JETS. 
</P>

<P>
 The troubled Kings' season took another downward turn Saturday when Wayne 
Gretzky suffered a twisted left knee midway through the second period and had 
to leave the game. Gretzky said he won't play today against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 He had one assist as the Kings went on to lose, 4-3, to the Winnipeg Jets. 
Nelson Emerson scored two goals for the Jets in their final home game of the 
season. The Kings, who were officially eliminated from the playoffs last week, 
have lost three consecutive games and are 1-6 in their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky injured his knee while killing off a penalty with the Jets holding a 
3-2 lead. Moving laterally, he jumped to avoid a check and came down awkwardly 
and limped off the ice. Later, Gretzky said he stepped on the stick of 
Winnipeg's Darrin Shannon when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the game, Gretzky said the knee was not swollen, but he was 
limping. But he did not rule out playing in the Kings' final two home games 
this week. Gretzky has points in 10 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Blake and Dixon Ward scored for the Kings in the second period when it 
looked as if they might overcome a 3-0 first-period deficit. John Druce had the 
last goal for the Kings, late in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Romaniuk and Darrin Shannon also scored for Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Romaniuk scored after taking a pass in front and beating Robb Stauber at 8:13 
of the first period. Shannon slapped a hard shot through the pack in front of 
the King net at 11:18, prompting the Kings to replace Stauber with Kelly 
Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
 But Emerson poked a loose puck past a prone Hrudey with 32 seconds left in the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The second period was dominated by the Kings, and the turnaround started with 
Blake's slap shot at the 1:30 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward made it 3-2 with 12 seconds left on the Kings' first power play, when he 
deflected the puck past Winnipeg goalie Tim Cheveldae at 8:17. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson gave Winnipeg a two-goal edge at 7:45 of the third with his second 
goal of the game. Druce scored at 16:16.

 UCLA started slowly but gained momentum in a 12-15, 15-11, 15-8, 15-8 victory 
over USC in the final of the UCLA volleyball tournament Saturday at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Nygaard had 27 kills and nine blocks and Tim Kelly added 10 blocks to 
lead the top-ranked Bruins (22-1) before a crowd of 1,061. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Underwood and Jason Mulholland had 33 kills each in a losing effort for 
fourth-ranked USC (15-5). 
</P>
<P>
 USC gained a 5-0 lead in the first game before the Bruins came back to tie it 
twice before finally losing the game. 
</P>
<P>

 Sandy McCarthy and Ron Stern, better known for their time in the penalty box, 
scored Saturday for the Flames, who hung on for a 4-2 victory over Detroit at 
Calgary and retained a slim chance of overtaking the Red Wings for the Western 
Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary has 95 points, three behind the Red Wings.Each team has three games to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 James Patrick and Mike Sullivan also scored for Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 It was McCarthy's first goal since Dec. 30 and Stern's first since Jan. 24. 
The two have more than 400 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Keith Primeau scored twice in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 3, Boston 0 -- Wendel Young stopped 32 shots for his first shutout 
in four seasons as the Lightning, which won't be in the playoffs, won at Boston 
to complete an 11-day sweep of Buffalo, Montreal and the Bruins, the three 
teams fighting for fourth place in the Eastern Conference and home ice in the 
first round.

 Washington 8, Ottawa 4 -- Todd Krygier scored three goals and the Capitals 
moved within a point of wrapping up a playoff berth at Landover, Md.

DUCKS WIN ONE FOR THE ROAD; HOCKEY: TEAM GETS EXPANSION RECORD WITH 3-1 VICTORY 
OVER VANCOUVER DESPITE DEPLETED LINEUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks started the final road game of their first season beaten and 
battered. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, they weren't beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without their top two scorers, their best fighter, and three of their 
top four centers, they defeated Vancouver, 3-1, Saturday at Pacific Coliseum 
anyway -- and set NHL records for most victories (33) and most road victories 
(19) by a first-year team. 
</P>
<P>
 One other note. The victory guaranteed that the new Southern California team 
with the goofy nickname will finish ahead of the 1993 Stanley Cup finalist 
Kings in the standings. Under last season's postseason format, the Ducks' 
fourth-place finish would have put them in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their expansion companions, the Florida Panthers, are still alive in their 
playoff race and have set an expansion record with 80 points with three games 
left (the Ducks have 71). Florida has won 32 games and can overtake the record 
for victories -- which was 31 before this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the road record is the Ducks' to keep. They finished at 19-20-3, and 
Florida ended its road schedule with 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was unbelievable, with what we had to work with tonight," Coach Ron 
Wilson said after the Ducks' victory was assured by Joe Sacco's empty-net goal 
with 20 seconds left as a six-on-four Vancouver advantage expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were down to one regular center. . . . We as coaches were looking at the 
cards tonight not knowing how we would come through." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Shtalenkov made 32 saves in his first game since March 22, and shut 
out fellow Russian Pavel Bure -- the NHL goals leader with 58. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury-struck Ducks had to go with 11 forwards and seven defensemen. They 
have been without center Bob Corkum since March 27, when his season was ended 
by a severed tendon in his foot. Right wing Terry Yake, who shares the scoring 
lead with Corkum, had to sit out because of a mild concussion suffered against 
Edmonton on Friday. Center Shaun Van Allen had gone home to Anaheim because of 
the birth of his first child. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrik Carnback, a double-shifting center, broke a 1-1 tie at 14:34 of the 
third when he put a rebound into a nearly open net after Kirk McLean went down 
near the right post to stop a shot by Sacco, who had a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to go out like lions, not like lambs," Wilson said. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kariya, the Mighty Ducks' unsigned No. 4 overall draft pick and a North 
Vancouver native, was in the stands and will travel to Anaheim this week to 
watch the final game of the season Wednesday. He and the Ducks are still 
millions apart on a multiyear deal. He doesn't plan to negotiate further until 
after playing in the World Championships later this month.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARDINALS GAIN SPLIT WITH GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury gave up a home run to Barry Bonds and then not much else, but by 
the time his St. Louis Cardinals finished winning the second game, 5-1, to 
split a doubleheader against the San Francisco Giants, most of the fans at 
Candlestick Park had left. 
</P>
<P>
 A cold, windy evening was exacerbated by a four-hour, 11-inning first game, 
won by the Giants, 4-3, on Matt Williams' two-out, run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first few days it was beautiful. The last couple of days it's been all 
I've heard about," said Rich Monteleone, signed by the Giants as a free agent 
in the off-season and the first-game winner. "The Giants are the only team I've 
played for that have five different jackets." 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury and Salomon Torres engaged in a pitchers' battle for four innings of 
the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals didn't get a hit off Torres until the fifth inning. Then he 
faltered, giving up five hits and three walks in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Oquendo drove in Mark Whiten with a single to tie the score, and 
Tewksbury followed with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (2-0) gave up six hits in seven innings and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 2, Philadelphia 1 -- In his first victory after a disappointing 
1993, John Smiley pitched 7 1/3 shutout innings for the Reds, who won their 
third in a row at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley, a washout in the first season of an $18.4-million, four-year contract, 
won for the first time since June 7 by limiting the Phillies to seven hits. He 
was 3-9 last year and needed elbow surgery in August. 
</P>
<P>
 He has given up only three runs in his two starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 10, Colorado 5 -- Carlos Garcia homered and drove in three runs, 
and Jay Bell had three hits at Pittsburgh as the Pirates finally got some 
production from the top of their batting order and became the last National 
League team to get a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's top two spots in the order, filled by Garcia, Bell and Al Martin 
thus far, were a combined one for 31 as the Pirates started 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
 They picked on the right team. Despite a league-leading 11 homers in five 
games, the Rockies have been outscored, 46-30, while losing four of five. Their 
team earned-run average is 7.16. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 8, Houston 2 -- After starting the season under a five-day suspension 
for spraying bleach on reporters last season, Bret Saberhagen made his first 
start a good one, pitching a five-hitter at Houston and taking a shutout into 
the ninth inning before giving up consecutive homers to Andujar Cedeno and 
pinch-hitter Chris Donnels. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Montreal 3 -- John Wetteland, who blew only six saves in 49 chances 
last season and had not given up a run since last Aug. 29, gave up two in the 
ninth inning at Montreal as the Cubs rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 15, San Diego 1 -- Jeff Conine hit two home runs and drove in five 
runs as the Marlins set a team scoring record at San Diego. Conine hit a 
three-run homer off A.J. Sager during an eight-run outburst in the seventh 
inning, and had a two-run shot off Mark Davis in a six-run ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 runs broke the team record of 12, set last Aug. 11 in a victory over 
the Chicago Cubs.

SMILIN SINGIN SAM TOO STRONG FOR FIELD AT REMINGTON PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smilin Singin Sam took the early lead and outran heavily favored Silver Goblin 
to win the $300,000 Remington Park Derby on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Smilin Singin Sam, with Larry Melancon aboard, entered the race as a 22-1 
longshot.But the 3-year-old took off from the No. 5 hole and led the rest of 
the 1 1/16-mile event that quickly became a two-horse race. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Goblin, the 2-5 favorite ridden by Dale Cordova, stayed about two 
lengths off the pace during the early going as both pulled away from the 
eight-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Silver Goblin rated real nice off that fast pace and I thought he'd 
sure come back," Cordova said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the two neared the top of the stretch, Smilin Singin Sam opened a 
five-length lead as Silver Goblin wobbled. Smilin Singin Sam held off Blumin 
Affair, trained by Hall of Famer Jack Van Berg, to win in 1:43 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling Singin Sam, a Dogwood Stable entry owned by W. Cothran Campbell, 
returned $46.60, $9.20 and $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumin Affair, with Alex Solis aboard, finished 2 3/4 lengths back and paid 
$3.40 and $2.60. Silver Goblin paid $2.20, six lengths off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the stretch, Silver Goblin slowed and gave up second place to Blumin 
Affair, the runner-up to Brocco in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita 
last fall.

TRACK AND FIELD / ARCADIA INVITATIONAL; STAFFORD RALLIES IN 100 METERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One of the fastest high school fields assembled in the boys' 100 meters 
provided plenty of theatrics Saturday night at the Arcadia/Foot Locker 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Running before 6,000 at Arcadia High, Bryan Howard of Moreno Valley Canyon 
Springs and Pat Johnson of Redlands gained a quick lead and appeared to be 
running away from the field. But with 15 meters remaining, Jermaine Stafford of 
Rochester (N.Y.) Franklin came from behind to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford's time of 10.46 seconds is the nation's second fastest prep time this 
season, trailing Johnson's 10.42 recorded in a meet at UC Riverside two weeks 
ago. Howard, the defending State champion in the 100, was second in 10.55 and 
Johnson third in 10.57. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so nervous before the race that I feared I might not run well," said 
Howard, nursing a hip injury. "I just wanted to get out and lead from start to 
finish. Jermaine came out of nowhere, but I knew he was capable of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a football player-turned-sprinter participating in his 17th race, 
said he thought he would win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryan and I were neck and neck the whole way," he said. "Just before we got 
to the finish line, I saw this guy flash by us. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The three sprinters were expected to continue their battle in the 200 later in 
the evening, but Stafford pulled out with a sore hamstring and Howard scratched 
because of his hip. That opened the door for Johnson, who won in 21.18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking forward to another battle, but I'll take the win," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and Johnson will face each other again this weekend at the Mt. San 
Antonio Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir turned in one of the evening's best performances, 
winning the 110-high hurdles and 300 hurdles in times of 13.98 and 36.94, 
respectively. He has the nation's fastest times in both events this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip also ran legs on Muir's winning 400 and 1,600 relays, earning him the 
boy athlete of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Michael Granville of Bell Gardens recorded the nation's fastest time 
in the 800 with a 1:51.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Anderson of Long Beach Poly, a junior, further established herself as 
one of the leading sprinters with easy victories in the 100 and 200. Her times 
of 11.57 and 23.48 are the nation's fastest this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzy Powell of Modesto Downey set a national record with a throw of 178 feet 8 
inches, breaking the mark of 176-10 set by Melisa Weis of Bakersfield in 1990. 
Powell was the top girl athlete of the meet.

LOW CEILING HIGH ENOUGH FOR FISCHER; TRACK AND FIELD: CAMARILLO HIGH JUMPER 
CLEARS ONLY SEVEN FEET, BUT WINS AT ARCADIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High got a big monkey off his back, Jamaal Chase 
of Quartz Hill joined an exclusive club and Esa Sallinen of Burroughs took 
advantage of a big-name athlete failing to show in the Arcadia Invitational at 
Arcadia High on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the region record-holder in the high jump at 7 feet 4 inches, missed 
three times at 7-2 1/4 after clearing 7 feet on his first attempt, but it was 
good enough to defeat Arthur Lloyd (6-10) of Rialto Eisenhower and James 
Lincoln (6-8) of Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning height was also four inches higher than he jumped at Arcadia as a 
sophomore and a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of disappointed because my main goal this season was to clear at 
least 7-2 in all the big invitationals," Fischer said. "But it's OK. At least I 
got over (seven feet), which beats the heck out of last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer had a personal best of 7-1 entering last year's Arcadia meet, but 
managed only 6-8 and finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a bit of a gamble Saturday -- passing at 6-10 after Lloyd, Lincoln and 
he each cleared 6-8 -- but it paid off when he made 7 feet on his first 
attempt. Until then, he trailed Lloyd in the competition because the Eagle 
senior negotiated 6-10 on his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passing to seven feet was a little gamble, but I was pretty sure I could make 
that height," Fischer said. "Now it's on to (the Mt. San Antonio College Relays 
on Saturday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer cleared a then-personal best of 7-2 at Mt. SAC last year and loves the 
high jumping facility there, which is in direct contrast to his opinion of 
Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase had no complaints about the long jump facility as he leaped a personal 
best of 24-2 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 The long jump mark improved his personal best by 3 1/4 inches and makes him 
only the second athlete in the region to jump 24 feet in the long jump and 49 
feet in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase finished third in the triple jump at 47-8 3/4, but set a personal best 
of 49-3 to win the Sunkist Invitational in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The pole vault lost some of its luster when Scott Slover of Leland San Jose, 
the yearly national leader at 17-0, pulled out of the meet, but Slover's 
absence left the door open for Sallinen, who won with a personal best of 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, a senior foreign exchange student from Finland, was one of three 
vaulters to clear 15-6, but he was declared the winner on the basis of fewer 
total misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kokorowski of El Camino Real, who began the year with a personal best of 
13-0, continued his dramatic improvement this season with a third-place effort 
of 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's one-two punch of Jason Medearis and Brett Strahan notched three 
personal bests between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis timed 14.12 to finish third in the 110 high hurdles and 37.42 to 
finish second in the 300 intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Haslip of Pasadena Muir won both races with times of 13.97 and 36.94, 
but Medearis battled him shoulder to shoulder for the first seven flights of 
the intermediates before Haslip pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get under 38, that was my big goal coming in here," Medearis 
said. "I'm very happy about the way I ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan lowered his personal best by more than four seconds to finish third in 
the 1,600 with a time of 4 minutes 9.71 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 The Indian junior was never really in the hunt for first -- as Mebrahtom 
Keflezighi of San Diego led from start to finish to win in a yearly national 
leading time of 4:08.32 -- but Strahan closed well to improve upon his previous 
best of 4:13.90 which he ran to finish fifth in last year's Arcadia meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other athletes produced yearly region leading marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fischer of Thousand Oaks ran 9:10.42 to finish fifth in the boys' 3,200 
and Kim Mortensen, also of Thousand Oaks, timed 10:56.32 for fifth in the 
girls' race. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wenz of Canyon ran 1:54.46 for fourth in the boys' 800 and Cathy Prater 
of Agoura timed 44.48 in the girls' 300 low hurdles.

SHERWOOD HITS CLOSE TO HOME; COLLEGE BASEBALL: DOUBLE IN NINTH BY FORMER 
BURROUGHS CATCHER SPARKS CUESTA TO A 10-8 VICTORY OVER PIERCE IN BATTLE OF 
DIVISIONAL LEADERS.

<P>
 There's no place like home, or at least closer to it, for Bobby Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood, a former Burroughs High catcher now at Cuesta College, hit a two-run 
double with one out in the top of the ninth inning Saturday to give the Cougars 
the tying and go-ahead runs in a 10-8 victory over Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuesta (24-11, 11-2 in conference play) entered the game with a four-game 
cushion over Moorpark in the Western State Conference's North Division. Pierce 
(16-12, 8-5) had its lead over Bakersfield in the South shrink to one-half 
game. The Cougars rallied for three runs in the ninth against relief ace Chris 
Frith-Smith (1-2). Troy Silva squeezed home Ryan Weeks with the final run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played as bad as we can play for the first half (of the game) but our bats 
kept us in it," Cuesta Coach Larry Lee said. "Some of our best hitters are just 
starting to get in a groove." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce opened a 4-0 lead in the second against right-hander Mario Mendoza with 
the help of two errors. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Kevin Milligan led off with a home run to left-center field. 
With one out, a two-base error by second baseman Kenny McMurry on a grounder by 
Robert Vazquez allowed Brian Sturges to score from second and John Novak from 
first for a 3-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez, who had three hits, scored on a two-out single by Cesar Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas got two more in the third on run-scoring singles by Novak and 
Vazquez with two out. Cuesta started its comeback with two runs in the fourth 
against right-hander Jason Warren, who made it only to the sixth inning, when 
the Cougars added three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Brown led off with a home run, McMurry had an RBI single for one of his 
four hits and Sherwood added a run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce increased its lead to 8-5 through seven, but Cuesta pulled to within 
one in the eighth on RBI singles by Troy Silva and Jesse Zepeda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas threatened in the ninth when Novak and pinch-hitter Adam West 
walked, but Harvey Gamboa got Martinez to hit into a game-ending grounder to 
second.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rio Mesa feasted off Bell-Jeff pitching Saturday, scoring 41 runs in a 
nonleague doubleheader at Rio Mesa. The Spartans won the first game, 11-4, 
behind Steve Arneson, who had three hits and four runs batted in, and Donald

<P>
 Agoura 1, Lompoc 0 -- Craig Gladstone (1-1) scattered seven hits over seven

STEERING CLEAR OF TROUBLE, STEWART WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIN ESPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In front of a near-capacity crowd and a national cable television audience, 
Tony Stewart of Indianapolis survived a war of attrition at Ventura Raceway, 
adding to his lead in the USAC Western States Midget Championship points 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the second of the season for the 1991 USAC Sprint Car rookie 
of the year, who finished fifth in the Midget standings last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six of 20 starters were running at the finish of the 30-lap main event, 
which was slowed five times by accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pole-sitter Page Jones, who defeated Stewart in an earlier 10-lap heat, was 
eliminated after flipping in the first turn on the first lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Pankratz and Simi Valley's Rick Hendrix were forced from the race when 
five cars spun or collided trying to avoid Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-time Western States champion Ron (Sleepy) Tripp had the pole for the 
restart, but Stewart got the jump when the green flag dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Rauch and Carry Faas spun out on the restart, John Cofer flipped into 
Jimmy Sills and Robbie Flock one lap later, and there were two more incidents 
on successive laps, but Stewart avoided the carnage each time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-lap semi-main served as a preview of what was to come, with Rauch 
taking the checkered flag under caution conditions after several spinouts and 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most spectacular flip of the evening occurred in the semi-main when Bob 
Ellis of Moreno Valley came over the rear tire of a car that had slowed for the 
caution flag. Ellis flew into the first-turn wall head-on at full power, then 
flipping back into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Moody of Ventura took the 20-lap three-quarter Midget main event, 
holding off another Ventura racer, Marc Hart.

CSUN ACROSS LINE FIRST IN LAST EVENT AT UCLA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The time of 3 minutes 11.93 seconds was not as fast as they had hoped for, but 
the members of Cal State Northridge's 1,600-meter relay team were nonetheless 
ecstatic after winning the final event of Saturday's triangular track and field 
meet against UCLA and UC Irvine in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 When Matador sophomore Akiem Brown held off UCLA senior Marcus Reed in the 
final straightaway, it marked the first time Northridge had beaten UCLA in the 
1,600 relay, an event in which the Bruins have won eight NCAA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does a great deal for our morale," Brown said. "If we had lost after 
having the lead, we definitely would have been down." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge assistant Tony Veney, who set a then-UCLA record of 1:48.5 in the 
880-yard run in 1973, might have been more excited than anyone with the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled to have four young men who can come in here and run that 
competitively," Veney said. "We've been getting closer and closer to them (in 
the 1,600 relay) over the last two or three years, but we always seemed like we 
were intimidated by them when we came here. This was the first time that I 
sensed that the guys thought they had a real chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Evans, who won the 100 in 10.89 seconds and the 200 in 21.59, ran a 
48.7-second opening leg for Northridge in the 1,600 relay. He was followed by 
Troy Collins (47.3) and Chris Brown (47.5) before Akiem Brown -- no relation to 
Chris -- ran a 47.9 anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA totaled 98 points to win the men's meet, followed by Northridge (76) and 
Irvine (15). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruin women won with 97 points, Northridge had 52 points and Irvine 
totaled 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherise Ellison of Northridge won the 200 in a wind-aided 24.66 and was second 
in the 100 in 12.03. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Matador winners were Kristen Dunn in the javelin (155 feet 4 inches) and 
Tannel House in the long jump (19-0).

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; LONG BEACH STATE GETS BACK AT THE TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing can be taken for granted when Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State 
come together on the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 That was obvious again Saturday night when Long Beach jumped on Fullerton ace 
Mike Parisi for five runs in the first four innings and went on to a 10-2 Big 
West victory in front of 1,826 at Blair Field. It was the largest home crowd 
ever for Long Beach State baseball. The 49ers turned the tables on the Titans, 
who won the opener of the three-game series Friday, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left Long Beach at 24-8, 5-3 in the Big West, and gave Coach Dave 
Snow his 400th collegiate coaching victory. Fullerton fell to 27-7 and 6-2 in 
the conference. The deciding game of the series is at 1:05 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi, who had a 1.44 earned-run average, gave up nine hits after allowing 
only six in his previous 15 1/3 innings. Long Beach pitcher Scott Rivette ran 
his record to 7-1, giving up six hits before leaving at the start of the eighth 
with an eight-run lead. Parisi fell to 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good show of character on our part," said Snow, taking note of his 
team's lopsided loss in the series opener. "It was good to see our club bounce 
back the way they did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had runners in scoring position in each of the first two innings 
but failed to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, Dante Powell walked and stole second, then advanced to third on 
a fielder's choice, but Jeff Ferguson struck out and Bret Hemphill grounded 
out. In the second, Jeremy Giambi doubled off the glove of a diving Rolando 
Avila in center field and Jason Gill walked, but Rivette struck out Jack Jones 
to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers clipped Parisi for two hits in the first inning. Eric Martins 
singled up the middle and, with two out, Jeff Liefer's hit advanced Martins to 
third. But Parisi got Jeff Tagliaferri to bounce out, ending the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more solid hits gave the 49ers two runs in the third. Avila singled, 
stole second and scored on Martins' line drive just inside first base. Liefer 
doubled off the bottom of the center-field wall, bringing in Martins. Parisi 
escaped without further damage when he struck out the next two batters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans got one run back in the fourth. Hemphill lined a triple off Avila's 
glove to open the inning and scored when Mark Kotsay grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State unloaded on Parisi for four runs in the fourth. Consecutive 
hits by Nate Vopata and Tim Falsken and a walk to Avila loaded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Vopata scored on an error by Titan third baseman Gill, whose throw to the 
plate was in the dirt. Ryan Miller doubled in two more runs and sent Parisi to 
the bench in his earliest exit of the season. Chad Rolish came on in relief and 
gave up two consecutive walks, the last to Ramon Smith, which forced in another 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans scored a run in the sixth. Ferguson led off the inning with a 
double and scored on Adam Millan's one-out single. The Titans stranded two 
runners in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia 7-7, Point Loma Nazarene 3-5 -- Jake Miller gave up two earned runs 
in seven innings and Alex Vicario had two hits and two RBIs to lead Concordia 
(14-19-1, 4-5) to the sweep. Point Loma, ranked No. 3 in NAIA, is 22-10, 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 UC San Diego 7-9, Chapman 3-3 -- Donny Disbro hit a two-run homer in the 
second game for Chapman (10-20-1), which gave up 23 hits in the two games.

PREP TRACK ROUNDUP; GARRITSON'S TIME IN 3,200 IS NATION'S BEST OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carrie Garritson of Buena Park posted the best outdoors time reported in the 
nation this year, winning the 3,200 meters in 10:39.33 at the Arcadia/Foot 
Locker Invitational Saturday at Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in her first meet since the Sunkist Invitational in February, when 
she ran her worst race in three years, Garritson broke from the pack with 1,200 
meters remaining and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were going too slow," Garritson said. "I felt like I could have 
run another mile." 
</P>
<P>
 With one lap remaining, Garritson led by 20 yards, but at the end of the race 
her lead over the second-place runner was only 1.63 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea anyone was behind me," Garritson said. "I was just running my 
own race." 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' 800, Tiffany Boykin of Laguna Hills, recovering from a head 
cold, finished second with a county season-best of 2:16.30. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a really good time for me, but I wanted to run faster," Boykin said. 
"At the Pasadena races I was so excited to get that time so I could be here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' high jump, Misty May of Newport Harbor finished second with a 
height of 5-6. Teammate Tina Bowman, jumping with a sore heel, tied for third 
at 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' discus, Angela Burgess of Woodbridge threw a county season-best 
137-7, finishing seventh. Gina Heads of Newport Harbor threw a personal best of 
135-1. The event was won by Downey Medesto's Suzy Powell, who broke the high 
school federation record with a throw of 178-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads finished first and improved the county season-best in the shotput with a 
distance of 45-7. Delores Tuimoloau of Simi Valley Channel Islands, the 
nation's leader in the shotput, was second in 45-3 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' shotput, Newport Harbor's Wade Tift (59-6) finished first, with 
his effort from the preliminary round. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's Tara Oettinger improved on the county's season-best in the girls' 
long jump, with a distance of 18-11 3/4, giving her a fourth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 In open events, Chris Clark of El Modena finished first in the 800, with a 
county-best time of 1:52.57. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' open 800, Edison's Julie Kaudelka posted an impressive 2:16.95 
in her victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In other top performances from athletes outside the county: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jermaine Stafford of Rochester (N.Y) Franklin came from behind with 15 
meters remaining to nip Bryan Howard of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs and Pat 
Johnson of Redlands in the 100 meters. His time of 10.46 seconds was the 
nation's second fastest this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir swept the 110-high hurdles and 300 hurdles in 
times of 13.98 and 36.94, respectively. Haslip also ran legs on Muir's winning 
400 and 1,600 relays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sophomore Michael Granville of Bell Gardens recorded the nation's fastest 
time in the 800 with a 1:51.90. 
</P>
<P>
 * Andrea Anderson of Long Beach Poly, a junior, posted easy victories in the 
100 and 200. Her times of 11.57 and 23.48 are the nation's fastest this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Suzy Powell of Modesto Downey set a national record with a throw of 178 feet 
8 inches, breaking the mark of 176-10 set by Melisa Weis of Bakersfield in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southland Invitational track meet: 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda's boys finish third, girls seventh -- Brett Saari finished second 
in the two mile, with a time of 10:16.7, and placed fourth in the mile in 
4:47.2 to help Brea-Olinda's boys take third place at the Southland 
Invitational at Hemet West Valley High.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Gray finished second in the 440 in 53.14, and he ran a leg on the 440 
relay team, which finished third in 45.9. He also was a member of the mile 
relay team, which took third (3:38.2). 
</P>
<P>
 On the girls' side, Kelly Daucher won the mile (5:34.3) to record 
Brea-Olinda's only victory as the team finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats' chances were hindered by the absence of three key runners. Carl 
Daucher, the team's top distance runner, missed the meet to attend the 
California Assn. of Student Leaders meeting. Roger Wirz, the team's top pole 
vaulter and 300 hurdler, was out because of a slight concussion he suffered 
during Friday's practice when his pole snapped, and Brian Mochon, an 800 
runner, was out because of severe shin splints.

GRAND NATIONAL; IT'S NO PROBLEM FOR 16-1 SHOT MIINNEHOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after the biggest fiasco in Grand National history, the world's premier 
steeplechase went off without a hitch Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miinnehoma, a 16-1 shot ridden by Richard Dunwoody, held off a late challenge 
from Just So to win the grueling 4 1/2-mile race at Aintree by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorcroft Boy, the 5-1 favorite, finished third and Ebony Jane, a 25-1 shot, 
was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best performance by a female jockey in the National, Rosemary 
Henderson, 51, rode 150-1 shot Fiddlers Pike to fifth place. Roc de Prince was 
the sixth and only other finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor conditions caused by recent heavy rain took their toll on the other 30 
starters, who either fell, lost their riders or pulled up on the heavy ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The main casualty was The Fellow, the French-trained gelding bidding to become 
only the second horse in history to win both the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Grand 
National in the same year. The Fellow was contending for the lead when he fell 
at the 24th fence. 
</P>
<P>
 What mattered most, really, was that the race came off. Last year, it was 
declared void after two false starts. 
</P>
<P>
 A new starting procedure worked perfectly, as starter Simon Morant pressed an 
electronic button that automatically raised the tape above the heads of the 
jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Police mounted a massive security operation to prevent the race from being 
disrupted by animal-rights activists. Last year, demonstrators got onto the 
course, causing one of the false starts.

MURDER IN MONTANA: VICTIMS INCLUDED RANCHER AND INNOCENCE; CRIME: WAYNE 
STEVENSON'S DEATH WAS AS IF BEN CARTWRIGHT HAD BEEN SLAIN. A MAN SOUGHT BY 
CALIFORNIA ON MURDER CHARGE IS ACCUSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Stevenson didn't have to check his cows every night. As one of Montana's 
most prosperous ranchers, the nation's biggest breeder of Black Angus cattle, 
he had hired hands for that. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also was a man who fussed over his cows as if they were children, 
especially in calving season. A breeched calf might have to be pulled out of 
its mother. A cow could steal another's newborn calf. There's no telling what 
might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 And so at 9 p.m. on March 27, Stevenson climbed into his mud-caked truck and 
drove 10 miles out to his calving shed, a dark and cavernous barn packed with 
pregnant cows. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just like any other night -- until the ransom call at 11:41. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got your husband and his red pickup, and I want $1 million in 24 hours," 
a man told Stevenson's wife, Marian. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, searchers dug Stevenson's bullet-riddled body out of a manure 
pile in a lean-to near the calving shed. On March 31, a trusted ranch hand was 
charged with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson's death was unsettling enough for the 226 people of Hobson, a speck 
on the map in central Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shock reached far beyond Judith Basin County, which hadn't had a 
murder since 1945. As more than 1,000 mourners poured into town for the 
funeral, Stevenson's stature in the ranching world became clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age when the Old West image of rugged ranchers has been diluted by 
absentee landlords and agribusiness conglomerates, Wayne Stevenson was the real 
item: a cattleman's cattleman who thrived on the harsh Montana range only to be 
betrayed while doing what he loved best -- tending his herd. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if Ben Cartwright had been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want money," said his daughter, Valerie. "All he wanted was better 
cows." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody went to him for advice on cattle," said Tess Brady, an old friend. 
"If they needed a bull, he'd loan them a bull. If they needed help, he'd help 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Stevenson was born 51 years ago, the third of five sons in a Hobson 
ranching family. He never strayed from the Judith Basin, a broad and grassy 
plain ringed by low mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 He married Marian when he was 18 and she was 16, and they moved into an 
8-by-30-foot trailer on his parents' ranch. Stevenson worked for his father but 
was paid only in livestock, so the newlyweds raised cash by hand-milking cows 
and raising bum lambs, castoffs rejected by ewes. 
</P>
<P>
 They also reared a family: first Valerie, then Doug and Clint. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1972, they had saved enough to buy their own ranch, a modest spread of 
about 1,500 acres and 150 cattle. They named it the Basin Angus Ranch and 
raised purebred Black Angus cattle for breeding stock. 
</P>
<P>
 With an unerring eye for cows, a knack for salesmanship and an enthusiasm for 
15-hour work days, Stevenson steadily expanded his ranch to 25,000 acres. The 
trailer home is long gone, replaced by a big house with five bathrooms and an 
indoor swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stevenson was not softened by success. At 51 he was still as sturdy as a 
post, with calloused hands and a rancher's tan, his forehead white beneath the 
shade of an ever-present cap. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd rouse friends with phone calls before dawn, declaring, "Early's all over 
by 6 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, when it was 40 below, he was outside all day, hustling pregnant 
cows to shelter until his hands turned numb. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch hands say Stevenson never asked them to work harder than he did, and he 
was as loyal to them as they were to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never fired a person, even when some of us thought he should," Marian 
Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hired 32-year-old David Llamas Blake last year, putting him and his family 
up in a house across the road from the calving shed. Stevenson liked Blake. He 
worked hard and kept the house in good repair. 
</P>
<P>
 What Stevenson didn't know was that Blake was a wanted man. California 
authorities say he was a "coyote" who smuggled Mexicans across the U.S. border 
for a fee. They believe he killed a man in 1986, shooting him in the head 
because he didn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of March 27, soon after Marian Stevenson got the ransom call, she 
phoned Blake at his house. No, Blake said, he hadn't seen her husband, but he 
promised to go look. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't find him. Neither did the army of ranch hands, FBI agents, sheriff's 
officers, tracking dogs and pilots who scoured the ranch for the next 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Tuesday afternoon, when a skittish horse pawed up some manure 
in its lean-to, that Stevenson's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators quickly zeroed in on Blake. FBI agents traced the ransom call 
back to Blake's house, and authorities say there was blood on Blake's clothing, 
blood in the calving shed, and blood on a front-end loader sitting next to 
Blake's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with murder and kidnaping, Blake is being held without bail while 
awaiting trial. Authorities say they're still trying to determine whether 
others were involved in what one called "a bungled abduction." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Stevenson's family and friends, nearly everyone within a 
50-mile radius of Hobson, struggled with questions of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no explanation," Marian Stevenson the day after Blake was charged. 
"It's just an evil, and we can't find why." 
</P>
<P>
 After the murder, Hobson's few gathering spots were busier than usual. Some 
people just sat and stared. Others quietly swapped Wayne Stevenson stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Tess Brady said she'll miss his jokes, even the ones at her expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Morrow, owner of the R & R Ranch Cafe, will miss Stevenson's daily 
theatrics when he ordered pie. "Now don't put that on the tab," he'd say, "or 
my wife will find out for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson's wife and brothers and children and grandchildren -- all in Hobson 
and most in ranching -- will miss the man who always made time for family, even 
after long days in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a great loss," Marian Stevenson said. "But many people never know a 
love like we had for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Mourners squeezed into the Hobson High School gym, the largest hall in town, 
for the funeral. But it was not big enough for some old cowboys, who stood and 
watched from the parking lot, shy of crowds and closed-in places. 
</P>
<P>
 A horse-drawn hearse carried Stevenson past nubby fields softening with the 
first green hints of spring. He was buried by the Judith River, in a quiet spot 
where the wind rustles through the cottonwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the funeral, Doug Stevenson drove out to the calving shed where his 
father was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not for sentimental reasons. Newborn calves, jet black and still wet 
from the womb, hobbled around the pens. Doug chased after them, clamping tags 
into their ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad would be disappointed," he said, "if we didn't get all the chores 
done."

RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CHARGES RAISED IN EAST TEXAS PUBLIC HOUSING; SEGREGATION: 
HUD'S CISNEROS SAYS DAYS OF SEPARATE HOUSING FOR BLACKS AND WHITES ARE OVER AND 
POINTS TO INTEGRATION IN VIDOR. BUT RESIDENTS OF 188 PROJECTS IN STATE DISPUTE 
HIS ROSY CONCLUSION.

 It was a rainy wintry day, and Gwendolyn Davis had her oven on to cut the 
chill. The new heaters didn't work, but the Beaumont Housing Authority had 
known about that for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't take care of us," said Davis, a well-spoken woman in her 60s. 
"When you call in a work order, half the time maintenance is somewhere else. 
You don't get the quick service you should, and you get nasty attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents of Grand Pine, a 94-unit apartment complex for low-income 
elderly people, have joined with nearly 40% of the tenants in Beaumont's 10 
public housing projects to demand that Carolyn Hudler, Housing Authority 
executive director, be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants charged "disrespectful" and "humiliating" treatment by authority 
personnel, and blistered Hudler for being "insensitive to our needs, concerns, 
safety and health." 
</P>
<P>
 This is special code, understood by all. Davis and the vast majority of 
Beaumont's tenants are black. Hudler, and the majority of her employees, are 
white. Black employees call the Housing Authority "the White House," but not 
because of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaumont, a rough-and-tumble oil town 90 miles east of Houston, is the hub of 
the biggest housing discrimination lawsuit in U.S. history, affecting 60,000 
low-income people in 36 East Texas counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit covers 188 East Texas public housing projects, of which 98, or 52%, 
are racially segregated. For decades, federal and local housing officials have 
practiced informal apartheid here: one standard for whites; another standard 
for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant is the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, and 
East Texas is the acid test for an agency charged in at least 12 U.S. cities 
with using federal dollars to prolong segregation and discrimination through 
its low-income housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros insists that those days are over. On Sept. 14, he 
traveled to Vidor, Tex., just north of Beaumont, and took over the local 
housing authority to integrate an all-white project. "This is a new day," he 
proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 4, he followed up by filing separate desegregation plans for all 70 
public housing authorities in the East Texas counties, deliberately putting 
HUD's reputation on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is no question that HUD has been part of the problem for a long 
time," said Roberta Achtenberg, HUD's assistant secretary for fair housing and 
equal opportunity. "Secretary Cisneros is trying to reverse that pattern 
significantly and irretrievably." 
</P>
<P>
 He is also trying to reverse it nationwide. "We have decided to tackle this 
one first," Achtenberg added, with the hope that "progressive models" developed 
in East Texas "can be applied elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 But many HUD-watchers are not so sure of the agency's resolve. Vidor, 
notorious as a onetime Ku Klux Klan stronghold, was a welcome symbol of HUD's 
good intentions, they note, but it was only one project among 188 in East 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are also disappointed that HUD has decided to support Hudler in 
Beaumont, even though the Houston district office made a preliminary assessment 
that she should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Dallas attorney Michael M. Daniel, who filed the suit nearly 15 years 
ago, is skeptical that HUD's action will address the many forms of housing 
discrimination in the region. East Texas, he says, has "separate but unequal" 
housing for different races, local officials "steer" white and black tenants to 
segregated projects and send families to apartments that are too big or too 
small, but where people are the same color. 
</P>
<P>
 At Grand Pine, tenants have 28 outstanding requests for basic maintenance, 
painting, insulation, security guards and vent hoods for stoves. No one has a 
bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 At Neches Park, hard by the Beaumont piers, mountains of wood chips waiting 
for export give off pungent fumes in the rain, leaving children with headaches 
and coughs. At Northridge Manor, some children recently were found to have high 
lead levels in their blood, and several units had faulty air conditioners and 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need people in charge that more clearly understand the predicament here," 
said Barbara Scott, president of the Northridge Manor Resident's Council. "The 
point is that people from outside Beaumont are in charge of people inside 
Beaumont. At 5:30 (p.m.), they go home to their world and leave us to 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel has complained to HUD for years, and HUD has promised change. Cisneros' 
and Achtenberg's effort will be the fourth attempt to redress East Texas 
housing discrimination in the last decade. All previous tries failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely convinced of Henry Cisneros' and Roberta Achtenberg's good 
will," Daniel said. "But to believe they are about to turn around . . . 
agencies who have fought desegregation tooth-and-nail would be to ascribe to 
them superhuman powers." 
</P>
<P>
 Festering conflicts like Beaumont's have sapped HUD's energy in East Texas and 
provoked disdain among housing advocates who question both HUD's good will and 
motives. "These PHAs (public housing authorities) are thumbing their noses," 
said Scott Newar, a Beaumont public-interest attorney helping Daniel in East 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Newar is pressing HUD to take over Beaumont, as it did Vidor, "to send a 
message" to the 70 East Texas authorities. Instead, HUD appears to be using 
Vidor as its model for what can happen to housing authorities that don't fall 
into line. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of last month, Vidor's earth-colored, one-story buildings housed 10 
black tenants, with U.S. marshals and Vidor police ensuring their safety. 
Intimidation last year drove away the project's first black residents, one of 
whom was subsequently murdered in what authorities called an unrelated 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "From growing up in the Golden Triangle, you know about Vidor -- that it's 
all-white, prejudiced, a troubled city," said Valeria Stredic Reed, 21, who 
moved into the project Jan. 13. "But it was a challenge, so I decided to do 
it."

PROJECT RESCUES BRAZIL'S STREET CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOVA CHAPOVAL, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like thousands of other children and adolescents, 17-year-old Adriana de Souza 
has a family but for a long time her home was the streets of Salvador, a port 
city in Brazil's tropical northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Adriana took drugs, got pregnant at 15 and induced an abortion by taking 
dangerous medication. 
</P>
<P>
 But today Adriana's life has turned around. She has learned to read and write, 
has a job and, most important, has returned home to live with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Adriana is one of the success stories of Projeto Axe, which helps nearly 3,000 
of the more than 15,000 street children in Brazil's third most populous city. 
</P>
<P>
 Adriana, who is about to open her first savings account, has a dream: To buy a 
home someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I lived on the street I had a dream, which I knew could never come true. 
Then I was given this opportunity and now I know it can," said the bubbly 
teen-ager as she stirred a bowl of steaming soup in the kitchen of a factory 
belonging to OAS, one of Brazil's biggest construction companies. 
</P>
<P>
 OAS is a major supporter of Projeto Axe and employs 50 16- and 17-year-olds 
who have gone through the program. This number is expected to rise to 100 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Axe, an African word meaning positive energy, was founded in 1991 by Italian 
lawyer and philosopher Cesare de Florio la Rocca. 
</P>
<P>
 Axe has a philosophy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want children to leave the streets but through the self-realization that 
the streets are no place for them to be." 
</P>
<P>
 La Rocca has worked with children for 31 years, 26 of them in Brazil. For four 
years, he served as senior program officer for the U.N. Children's Fund in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of the Italian non-governmental group Terra Nova, La Rocca 
set out in 1990 to survey Salvador's street children. 
</P>
<P>
 The census found that only 823 children actually slept on the streets but 
12,000 lived off the streets, selling candy, washing windshields, begging or 
stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993 this number had risen to more than 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Axe's biggest goals is to stimulate the children to return home. La 
Rocca estimates that only 15% do not have homes or have completely lost touch 
with their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not really need shelters because so many of the children have started 
to return home. Even though the misery continues and their families are still 
as big a disgrace as ever, the children create conditions that allow them to 
more easily accept their families as they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Nilton Silva de Jesus, a 17-year-old who works as an office boy at OAS, used 
to sell candy on the streets, where he also spent many a night. "My father used 
to yell at me that I didn't work, that I only ate. Now he treats me 
differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rio de Janeiro, where last July's massacre of eight sleeping street 
children provoked an international outcry, the Inter-American Development Bank 
is investing in a project similar to Axe. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Axe, Projeto Semear seeks to teach street kids and children from very 
poor families to read and write as well as basic skills needed to gain 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Semear, a joint project between the city government and the Catholic 
archdiocese, has received a three-year donation of $300,000 from the bank, 
which last year announced an $8-million grant for street children projects in 
Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Semear offers its 200 students workshops in graphics, sewing, silk-screening 
and electronics. The children pocket part of the profits they earn making 
T-shirts and raising chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same method used by Axe, where the children also benefit 
financially from apprenticeships, even before they are placed in companies such 
as OAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Semear's students also study agriculture. "It is not so much that we are 
preparing them to be farmers," said Alexandre Gollo, one of the teachers. 
"Rather, it is a sort of therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 The violence and death that pervade the lives of these children has removed 
all notion of a future. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children have always lived for the immediate," he said. "But with 
gardening they learn patience."

ANCIENT CURES, MODERN MEDICINE CLASH; KOREA: TRADITIONAL WAYS VIE WITH NEW 
CURES, NOT ONLY FOR PATIENTS BUT FOR REFERRALS AND INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a hole-in-the-wall pharmacy off a crowded side street, the shelves hold 
familiar brands of aspirin and cough syrup -- along with exotic remedies like 
ginseng, bear claw and reindeer antler. 
</P>
<P>
 It might look like an example of modern medicine coexisting with traditional 
Asian cures. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, South Korean pharmacists have fought a long battle with 
traditional healers over who has the right to dispense herbal remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 That dispute, in turn, is part of a larger struggle between the modern medical 
Establishment and so-called Oriental doctors, who practice centuries-old 
healing methods like acupuncture, massage and meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to make one system, one way to practice medicine," said Dr. Kang 
Sung-keel, an acupuncturist who teaches at the College of Oriental Medicine at 
Seoul's Kyunghee University. "They ignore our methods and don't believe in 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 In a treatment room across from his office, Kang's patients recline in 
curtained cubicles. 
</P>
<P>
 A young man's face bristles with needles. 
</P>
<P>
 A middle-aged woman lies on her side with a cone of compressed moxa leaf 
burning on her cheek, filling the air with a bitter-musk fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Many South Koreans prefer traditional herbal doctors to those trained in 
Western medical methods. Oriental medicine is a multimillion-dollar business 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 But people are also proud of South Korea's near-miraculous economic growth in 
the 1970s, which helped the country build a modern medical Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Public health professionals cite steep drops in the incidence of infectious 
diseases and infant mortality and point to the role of vaccinations, new 
clinics and hospitals and stricter regulation of medications. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriental practitioners say much of their medicine is preventive, and its 
effects are thus harder to quantify. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, traditional practitioners must be licensed by the government. 
They undergo a minimum of six years' training. Students compete fiercely for 
places at one of the country's 11 Oriental medical schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what they describe as high professional standards, the herbal doctors 
believe the system works against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most South Korean insurance covers only limited treatment by Oriental doctors, 
so their services tend to cost patients more. 
</P>
<P>
 The herbal doctors also say government regulators are more likely to come from 
the ranks of Western-style medicine -- and thus are more sympathetic to the 
medical Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Western-style doctors, they complain, generally refuse to cooperate with 
referrals, provide medical records or perform lab and other tests for patients 
who are seeing an Oriental doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Asian medicine is not without its modern aspects. Acupuncture 
needles were once fashioned of jade and fish bone; now they are stainless steel 
and disposable. Kang's young students use computer imaging to map meridians, or 
energy pathways. 
</P>
<P>
 In the school's herbal pharmacy, wooden drawers labeled with Chinese 
characters stretch from floor to ceiling, like a room-sized version of an old 
apothecary chest. On a work table, herbs are heaped in fragrant piles -- deep 
red, pale feathery green, sticky black -- for hand-wrapping into paper packets. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the pharmacy's tradition-steeped air, prescriptions are 
computerized and code-numbered, and a digital scoreboard in the waiting room 
advises patients when theirs are ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The herbalists have tried to win a ban on Western-style pharmacies selling 
herbal cures, saying they alone should be allowed to dispense them. A law 
taking effect this summer will restrict such sales in the next few years, but 
not halt them outright.

BETTER SAFEGUARDS SOUGHT FOR RESEARCH SUBJECTS; MEDICINE: ETHICISTS NOTE THAT 
NEWER REGULATIONS FOCUS HEAVILY ON INFORMED CONSENT, WHICH WAS OFTEN ABSENT IN 
COLD WAR RADIATION EXPERIMENTS. BUT SOME WANT MORE SCRUTINY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each week the ads pop up in the help-wanted sections of newspapers around this 
hub for medical research: "Reap the Rewards of Research." "New Year's Cash Flow 
Low?" "Earn Up to $150." 
</P>
<P>
 The ads seek paid volunteers for medical studies, be it a closer look at 
toenail fungus or how the elderly sleep. Elsewhere, subjects come from the 
ranks of the sick; their payment is the hope of a cure for their illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people take part each year, and most of them are fully informed 
of risks involved, unlike the unwitting subjects of radiation research during 
the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 But most contemporary research on humans goes on behind tightly closed doors, 
with scrutiny mainly by scientists' peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know more about how many mice, cats, dogs and monkeys are involved in 
experiments than we do about people," said Arthur Caplan, director of the 
Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the federal guidelines on use of laboratory animals are 83 pages 
long, while its guidelines on human research subjects cover 19 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the right of patient privacy, the medical community says, is what 
mitigates against more information being collected on people. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows exactly how much research is performed on humans. But the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services, the biggest single backer of research 
on humans, funds nearly $5 billion worth of projects annually at about 1,000 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Who keeps track of the roughly 15,000 HHS projects each year? 
</P>
<P>
 That and all medical research on humans is guided by the so-called Nuremberg 
Code, principles of informed consent drawn up after disclosures about Nazi 
medical experiments conducted during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal regulations enacted only in the 1970s, the Office for Protection 
from Research Risks is charged with overseeing all research on humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the OPRR actually reviews research proposals for 600 of the hospitals, 
schools and businesses doing HHS research. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400 other institutions, considered the biggest and best in the country, 
get approval for research from their own institutional review boards, composed 
largely of people who work there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rely on the integrity of our investigators, and we have no real reason to 
believe they would violate the regulations," said Paula Knudson, coordinator of 
an institutional review board at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center 
in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every hospital or medical school is like a jungle; there are drums beating 
all the time," she said. "There are lots of eyes around." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that her board checks out about 1,000 research proposals a year, and 
that in her 17 years on the board the worst violation involved a researcher who 
failed to get all of his consent forms signed by participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Most complaints seem to center on what is known as "informed consent," that 
is, fully telling patients of the experiment and its risks. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, paralyzed patients at a Boston hospital contended last year that 
they were falsely promised they would be able to walk if they underwent an 
experimental spinal operation. And an independent review last year of a major 
women's health study found that study procedures did not give participants 
enough information on risks or benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of informed consent was at the heart of the controversy over 
radiation experiments at the Fernald State School for the Mentally Retarded in 
Waltham after World War II. That, and other recently disclosed Cold War studies 
with radiation, prompted investigations by the Clinton Administration and by 
some members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethicists note that regulations since the 1970s focus heavily on informed 
consent and make a repeat of the Fernald School experiments highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 But as recently as a 1992 congressional hearing, questions were raised about 
whether women in a breast cancer prevention study were being adequately 
informed about a drug they would take. 
</P>
<P>
 And late last month, the National Cancer Institute ordered the University of 
Pittsburgh to temporarily stop enrolling new patients in 14 cancer studies, 
including that of tamoxifen, which aims to test whether women susceptible to 
breast cancer can avoid developing the disease if they take the drug. Before 
enrollment can resume, the university and the cancer institute must examine the 
university's oversight procedures and safeguards. The suspension is expected to 
last at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ellis, director of the Office for Protection from Research Risks, said 
his office has investigated 115 complaints about research on humans in the last 
four years, leading to corrective actions in 90% of the cases. Most of them 
related to informed consent of research participants. 
</P>
<P>
 After the uproar over the post-World War II radiation experiments, some people 
want even more scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no disclosure regulations for strictly private research, leading 
some to call for a law covering all research on humans, just as the Federal 
Animal Welfare Act does for laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, drug company research increasingly is carried out by companies that 
specialize in testing, and those tests can escape the scrutiny they might get 
in a major teaching hospital, some critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. H. Jack Geiger, a past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, 
adds that more oversight is needed on human experiments by the military and 
intelligence agencies, for which there still is no independent review. 
</P>
<P>
 George Annas, chairman of the health law department at the Boston University 
Schools of Medicine and Public Health, said there should be more protections 
for experiments on children and the institutionalized disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical community resists these pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Scarlatelli, a spokeswoman for Brigham and Women's Hospital in 
Boston, wouldn't list research projects there, saying: "Our obligation is to 
report to various government agencies. Our obligation is not to report out to 
the press." 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is based on trust," said Ellis, the regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I told you there were no problems at 1,000 institutions and 15,000 
projects, you would have strong reason to conclude that I was either blind or 
looking in the wrong place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, the complaints his office gets give evidence of "a monitoring 
program that is vigorous and healthy."

IT WEARS PELT LIKE RICHEST FUR, DENUDES MARSH; ECOLOGY: THE NUTRIA'S INSATIABLE 
VEGETARIAN APPETITE PUTS LOUISIANA'S FLOATING ISLANDS OF VEGETATION IN PERIL. 
THE STATE HOPES TO ENCOURAGE TRAPPING TO REDUCE THE POPULATION OF THE CRITTERS, 
ALSO KNOWN AS RAT BEAVER OR COYPU.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are floating islands in Louisiana -- islands where herons nest in the 
branches of myrtle trees, alligators cruise beneath the roots and slow ripples 
spread out with every step you take. The mat of leaves, stems, and roots sinks 
beneath your feet and rises again behind you. 
</P>
<P>
 But now these floating masses of vegetation are in danger, all because of the 
insatiable appetite of a strange critter called variously the rat beaver, the 
coypu or the nutria. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a snub-nosed, slow-moving beast with webbed feet, scraggly fur, a naked, 
rat-like tail, and inch-long, orange buckteeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike rats, nutria average 15 pounds, have plush, velvety pelts beneath their 
scraggly guard hairs, and are vegetarian. 
</P>
<P>
 But their diet is a danger to the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 They have gnawed some areas down to circles of mud hundreds of acres across, 
said Greg Linscombe, a biologist with the state Department of Wildlife and 
Fisheries. They stymied a study to see if cypress plantings could reduce marsh 
erosion by gobbling all 100 seedlings within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some areas where you can go out and see literally hundreds of 
animals," Linscombe said. "It looks like a big pasture, except the whole thing 
is floating. And as far as you can see on the horizon, you see nutria." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, it is almost impossible to measure overall nutria damage in the 
masses of vegetation known as "flotants" in French or, in English, "floats." 
</P>
<P>
 "These floats are moving around. You almost have to do aerial photographs and 
measure land-water ratios over time to see if there is more water and less 
land," Linscombe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana State University ecologist Charles Sasser is leading a small-scale 
study. Last summer he and a team of researchers caged in small areas of the 
flotant to keep nutria out, and will measure the plants inside and outside the 
barriers next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The enclosed plants were already visibly taller in the fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar study on ordinary marshland wound up with vast mud flats surrounding 
small enclosed stands of high marsh grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The nutria problem has its origins in Scandinavia where an overabundance of 
farmed minks reduced the demand for nutria pelts. A few cold winters in Europe 
might be enough to control the mink competition, at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 From about 20 years starting in 1962, more than 1 million nutria pelts a year 
were harvested in Louisiana -- 1.7 million one year in the late '70s, Linscombe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During that entire time, you didn't hear anything about marsh damage from 
nutria," Linscombe said. "You didn't hear anything until '85-'86," Linscombe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, the nutria market plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reasons were a fashion change from fur to leather, combined with 
seven very mild winters in northern Europe, and overproduction of ranch mink 
that made mink as cheap or cheaper than nutria, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people put much of the blame on anti-fur protests by animal-rights 
activists. Linscombe said that may have played a part but was not a major 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 to 7,000 trappers had to look for other income. The number of 
nutria trapped for their fur dropped to a couple of hundred thousand a year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like once we got below 500,000 to 600,000, we started seeing 
damage, and having damage reported by land companies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutria are known as coypu in South America, their original habitat. But when 
the conquistadors saw them, they mistook them for otter and called them nutria 
-- Spanish for otter. They also have been called the South American beaver, but 
are really their own kind of animal. Their scientific name, Myocastor coypus, 
reflects the similarity to beaver, which has the scientific genus Castor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco creator E. A. McIlhenny brought nutria to Louisiana in 1937. He 
figured they could be farmed for their pelts. It was a reasonable idea -- 
nutria are farmed today in Europe. The pelts are used for both felt and fur and 
the meat, called ragondin, is sold as a delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the guard hairs, either by cutting or pulling them out, leaves a 
rich, velvety pelt. It is used more often as a lining than as an outer fur for 
coats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were raised in tremendous numbers at one time in Poland -- more mutation 
colors -- whites, blacks, gun-metal gray," Linscombe said. 
</P>
<P>
 McIlhenny's plans went awry in the floods of '39 and '40. Nutria swam out of 
their pens and into the swamps. Their only predator there is the alligator and, 
because one female nutria can bear six to eight litters a year, they were 
fruitful beyond all imagining. Within two years, they had spread to Texas and 
Mississippi. More recently, they have been seen as far north as Virginia and 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nutria denudes the marsh down to the soil, which is organic in nature. 
That may be just enough that the marsh cannot recover," Linscombe said. "It's 
an added factor that aggravates these other, more serious, conditions and may 
make the difference between the marsh continuing to be marsh or turning to open 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 The state is looking at several ways to deal with the problem and the 
attendant coastal erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Linscombe has traveled around North America and to Europe and the Far East to 
drum up interest in Louisiana furs. The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is 
also trying to drum up interest in nutria meat with a Nutria Fest at the 
Louisiana Nature and Science Center in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Nutria Fest, last fall, attracted a few hundred people and a score 
of chefs with a nutria cooking contest judged by Paul Prudhomme. It was hard to 
tell what the meat would taste like on its own, but many of the recipes were 
tasty enough to those who were willing to eat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like one veteran who had too many close encounters with rats in 
Vietnam, found themselves queasy at the thought of eating nutria, even though 
the Nature Center staff stressed that the critters are closer kin to the guinea 
pig than to the rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sort of bounty will be needed to encourage trapping, at least at first, 
Linscombe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have examined a lot of alternatives. We haven't found any. We know what 
works, because it worked in the '60s. If you have 5,000 or 6,000 people out 
there and they have a reason to trap the nutria, your problem is eliminated."

 The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore announced Friday that Pope John 
Paul II would visit the city on Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishop William Keeler said in a statement details were not finalized for 
the visit to Baltimore, America's first diocese. But Keeler said it was 
possible the Pope would hold a mass at Oriole Park.

VAN CLIBURN HAPPY TO BE BACK AFTER AN 11-YEAR BREAK; MUSIC: PIANIST SAYS THERE 
IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR LIVE PERFORMANCE. HE FINDS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DISCOVERING 
CLASSICAL MUSIC AND WANT TO KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN COMPOSERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Van Cliburn decided in 1978, after a demanding, 20-year career as a concert 
pianist, to take a little intermission. He enjoyed it so much that it lasted 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 During those 11 years, Cliburn did practice, "but not like I was going to play 
Carnegie Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so happy with life, to be able to be home. I got to eat regularly, 
which I never was able to do. I got to see my friends, and I was able to 
luxuriate in the sound and creativity of other performers." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before Cliburn left his Ft. Worth home for New York, he heard 
Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli. "When you hear a gorgeous voice like 
that," he said, "you know why every instrumentalist listens, to learn how to 
breathe, phrase, extend a line and project a melody. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what is important about playing the piano -- a really percussive 
instrument -- to try to make it lyrical." 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn has long been admired for his large but non-percussive tone, as well 
as for the completeness of his technical command. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn, 59, said he didn't miss performing during his "intermission." 
</P>
<P>
 But now that he's back on stage, he said, he doesn't feel like he has put 
himself back into a straitjacket. "I love music." 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels the same to be back playing concerts," the pianist said. "Nothing 
has changed. Don't you think that's the beauty of classical music? You don't 
have to reinvent yourself. What was good yesterday will still be good tomorrow. 
It doesn't go out of style." 
</P>
<P>
 But musical insights continue to come, he said, sometimes during practice. 
"Sometimes it'll come during a concert. That can be some of the greatest 
instruction, that you've understood something." 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn is the only child of Harvey Lavan and Rildia Bee Cliburn. His mother 
was his only piano teacher until he entered the Juilliard School at 17. She 
listened to his serious practice in 1987 and said yes to his re-entry as a 
performer. He debuted at a White House state dinner for Mikhail Gorbachev. His 
97-year-old mother, Cliburn said, is his "chief critic." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he resumed giving concerts, Cliburn hasn't performed a great deal. Sol 
Hurok booked a rigorous schedule for him in the years after he won the gold 
medal in the first Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1958. His triumph came 
six months after the Soviets put Sputnik in space; the tall, slim, courtly 
Texan was acclaimed as a Cold War hero for America. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Cliburn intends to step up his pace, but the only upcoming concerts he has 
announced so far are with the Houston Symphony at the Woodlands on May 28 and 
with Chicago's Grant Park Symphony on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also going to record, Cliburn said. A recent promotional tour coincided 
with RCA Victor's release of his Rachmaninoff "Piano Concerto No. 2" and 
Beethoven "Emperor Concerto," from the early 1960s, remastered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glenn Gould thought the day of the live concert was over," he said. "He would 
do recordings. I always said, 'Glenn, no, because this is so thrilling. When 
people would go to hear him, that was an experience right there. Live 
music-making -- there is never going to be a substitute for that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, he said, he found that young people are discovering 
classical music. "They express so much interest and want to know the history of 
certain composers and reasons behind certain compositions," he said. "It is 
really extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 It bothers Cliburn that some people don't try listening to classical music 
because they think, "It's too high for me. It's out of human existence." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're put off by the idea of structure," he said. "But it is so human. It 
is written for human beings. Beethoven said, 'I wrote from the heart to the 
heart' about his 'Missa Solemnis.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The music he likes best to play, Cliburn said, is music by a composer whose 
intent was "to realize the potential of the piano, who tried to make it sing as 
well as have a big, organic sound like an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer I live, I realize I know very little. You find that you're 
discovering and learning more with each day that goes by. It is wonderful. It 
keeps life very thrilling. I love to contemplate. I read a lot. If you have a 
book, it is to know that you are not alone. I love life, people, beauty and 
great music."

FLORIDA BAY ECOSYSTEM ON VERGE OF COLLAPSE; EXPERTS DIFFER ON CAUSE; 
ENVIRONMENT: SOME BLAME DIVERSION OF FRESH WATER FOR FARMING; OTHERS SAY 
POLLUTION RUNOFF IS UPSETTING THE BALANCE OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was a sunny Florida Keys morning, the kind of day when death should have 
been on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter fishing guide John Kipp revved up his 17-foot skiff and joked with his 
two passengers as they glided through flat bay water and headed for Rabbit Key. 
They were after big game: tarpon, which they would cut loose after capture to 
allow the silver monsters to fight again another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp saw the dead fish about eight miles out. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of 
them were lying on their sides, motionless but for the rocking caused by the 
boat's bow wave as he throttled back for a better look. Each button eye was 
staring into the sun, as if in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not small fish," Kipp recalled. "These were large snappers, 
barracudas. It certainly wasn't a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The fish devastation Kipp saw last August has become a distressingly common 
sight in Florida Bay, a 1,000-square-mile wedge of water between the Florida 
Keys and the Gulf of Mexico, once haunted by the likes of Zane Grey and Ernest 
Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agrees that Florida Bay is dying. The question is how to bring it 
back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 As it expires, it threatens to take with it much of south Florida's sport and 
commercial fishing industry. Floridians also fear harm to other natural assets, 
including almost 500,000 acres of mangroves that line the shores and islands, 
and the chain of coral reefs just offshore in the Atlantic Ocean that annually 
draw hordes of scuba divers and snorkelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusky blooms of algae sometimes stain as much as half of the bay. The brown 
and green smudges suck up oxygen that fish need for life and choke off beds of 
sea grass and sponges that lobsters, stone crabs and other species call home. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to swim in dark green water, and nobody wants to go fishing if 
the fish aren't there," said stone crabber and lobsterman Karl Lessard of 
Marathon, Fla. "I've seen dive boats just bring the people back to the dock and 
give them their money back because the visibility was down to zero." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ecosystem on the verge of collapse," said Michael Collins, an 
Islamorada charter boat owner who used to help run fishing expeditions for 
President George Bush and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just five years ago you could read a newspaper lying on the bottom through 
eight feet of water," Collins said. "Now, sometimes the visibility is less than 
six inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial fishermen and marine scientists report declines of 80% in catches 
of pink shrimp and 30% in juvenile spiny lobsters. Average lobster catches on 
the east side of the bay are down 40%, and commercial catches of pompano and 
mackerel have plummeted by 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage is all the more remarkable because it has occurred in an area 
nominally protected by the federal government. The bay is part of Everglades 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, environmentalists, along with fishermen and others who depend on 
Florida Bay for a living, have argued that the chief culprit has been the 
diversion of fresh water that once flowed into the bay from the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 That view is now disputed by scientists who blame high nitrogen levels caused 
by pesticides and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Since early in the century, water has been siphoned off from the vast wetlands 
to the north to create farmland, control flooding and provide drinking water 
for cities on both of Florida's coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshwater diversions have intensified over the last decade. Today, 1,400 
miles of canals drain off 970 billion gallons of water a year. Park 
hydrologists estimate that the bay receives as little as 10% of the fresh water 
it once did. 
</P>
<P>
 These diversions, the environmentalists say, have upset the delicate balance 
between fresh water and salt water that sustains Florida Bay's diverse plant 
and animal life, elevating salinity levels and setting off chains of 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 All this has produced a bitter struggle between the bay advocates and the 
farmers whose livelihoods depend on the diverted water. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of controversy and delay, state and federal agencies have agreed 
that the way to save the bay is to restore the flow of fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Corps of Engineers recently proposed that the federal government buy 
a belt of farmland north of the bay to act as a buffer zone between the 
Everglades and other farmland. The immense plumbing system would be redesigned 
to restore much of the freshwater flow into the bay. The initial estimated cost 
of the whole project is $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists argue that the biggest problem isn't salinity, but pollution. 
Some say that chemical runoff from farms and cities raises the levels of 
nitrogen in bay waters, sustaining the death-producing algae. Others attribute 
the high nitrogen content to decaying sea grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal proponent of the runoff view is marine biologist Brian LaPointe, who 
operates an independent laboratory at Florida's Big Pine Key. "Nutrient 
pollution is the No. 1 threat to water quality in Florida Bay," he said. 
"Adding more water is like adding fuel to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Rosendahl, dean of the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine 
and Atmospheric Science, advocates a federally financed two-year study of the 
bay's ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think lack of water flow into the bay is certainly a problem," he said. 
"But it's probably a complex series of issues, including pollution. I would 
like to know what the entire problem is before I start dumping money into any 
one part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, veteran fisherman John Kipp doubts that anything will be done 
soon. "We'll probably all be dead before it's cleaned up," he said.

 In an expanse of rolling hills and farmland on the edge of Amish country, the 
Police Department's typical week means a theft, a bad check, maybe a stolen 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence? Rare. Murder? Not since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But a typical day in Warwick Township finds the police chief pursuing 
pedophiles, rapists, big-time fraud artists and even vampire-style killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Alfred O. Olsen, one of a few self-appointed sheriffs patrolling 
America's latest rough-and-tumble boom town: cyberspace, the "world" created by 
millions of communicating computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a frontier without boundaries. It breaks down all the traditional 
jurisdictional restrictions," said Olsen, a 40-year-old former New Jersey 
police officer. "We're walking a new beat in a neighborhood without an end." 
</P>
<P>
 Local law enforcement, accustomed to nabbing crooks with old-fashioned brawn 
and clue gathering, is discovering it needs to track electronic footprints to 
find child pornography and invitations to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more people use computers, the more they find ways to abuse things," said 
Rick Sigurdson, an Internal Revenue Service investigator who is chairman of the 
Federal Computer Investigations Committee, an umbrella group of law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen's interest began in 1990, when Florida police investigating several 
vampire-style killings found in suspect John Crutchley's computer a map leading 
to a body -- in Warwick Township. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities never found the body, but Olsen was intrigued by the case anyway. 
Crutchley pleaded guilty to rape, and police said he lured victims to his home 
with his own computer "bulletin-board service." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen already had a computer, his daughter's, "so I bought a modem for 50 
bucks and I started."

 Today, on his own initiative, Olsen scours cyberspace for illicit activity, 
particularly sex crimes involving pedophilia. Mindful of his local 
responsibilities, he does most of his computer work on his own time; when he 
becomes aware of crimes, he offers his help to the proper jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 He's found a lot to investigate, from guidelines on killing parents to images 
of men having sex with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're rapidly approaching the point where there's a physical world and an 
electronic world. And they're doing exactly the same things," Olsen said. "And 
one of those things is sex." 
</P>
<P>
 In one prosecution, a California man operated a bulletin board to lure 
youthful rape victims to his home. One officer logged on posing as a 
15-year-old boy while Olsen signed on from Lititz portraying a fellow 
pedophile. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was simultaneously corresponding with the "boy" and sending Olsen 
messages about his intentions to rape. Police got him when he tried to attack 
an 18-year-old police cadet sent to his house undercover. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen went to California to testify but said he could have tried the case at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now, everything has had a base in physical presence," he said. "Now, 
what exists where? Where do you take possession? Where does the crime occur? 
These are questions we're going to have to answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in fighting computer crime love officers like Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a police officer in a small town who has taken on this very aggressive 
role to try and fill a void," said Ken Lanning, a specialist at the FBI 
Behavioral Sciences Unit in Quantico, Va. "It takes a special kind of police 
officer to know how to communicate this way."  
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the on-line community welcome police but prescribe a careful 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a culture gap between law enforcement and the electronic communities 
it's trying to police," said Mike Godwin, counsel for the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, an advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important they be involved. If they're not, that vastly 
increases the risk that they'll misunderstand some conduct they see or hear 
about," Godwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicts few problems in adapting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crimes committed in cyberspace will be mapped to our existing understanding 
of the law," Godwin said. "But we need to know how clear the map is. If I 
invade your computer, is that burglary or trespass?" 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen has been involved in more than a dozen criminal investigations involving 
computers. In his off time, he tours the country teaching other officers how to 
spot and fight computer crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to require a totally new law enforcement officer. The ham-fisted 
guy who goes in and breaks up a bar brawl is not the same guy who tracks 
computer child pornography," Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You still need the people who can dig ditches. You still need people to flip 
the hamburgers in law enforcement," he said. "You need all you originally had, 
but more."

SINGER SLEDGE ADMITS $95,000 TAX EVASION

 Singer Percy Sledge, whose biggest hit was the song, "When a Man Loves a 
Woman," has pleaded guilty to cheating the government out of more than $95,000 
in taxes from performances in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old singer who lives in Baton Rouge told U.S. District Judge John 
Parker on Thursday, "I knew I owed more."Later he said, "I'm glad it's all 
behind us now. It's something that didn't need to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Sledge was one of the biggest stars of the Soul Music craze of the 1960s. His 
first hit, "When a Man Loves a Woman" in 1966, was followed by "Warm and Tender 
Love," "Cover Me," "Take Time to Know Her," and "Out of Leftfield." 
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service said that Sledge failed to pay all the taxes he 
owed from 1987 to '89 from live performances for which he personally collected 
75% of his fees in cash or certified checks. 
</P>
<P>
 He could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and fined $750,000.

RESEARCHERS DEVELOP PIANO KEYS OF SYNTHETIC IVORY THAT FEEL REAL; SCIENCE: BAN 
ON USE OF ELEPHANT TUSKS PROMPTED HUNT FOR A SUBSTITUTE. NEW MATERIAL'S 
ADVANTAGE IS THAT ITS SURFACE RESEMBLES THAT OF IVORY, MAKING IT EASIER TO GRIP 
THAN PLASTIC.

<P>
 To Henry Scarton, the solution to the problem of the piano keys was at his 
fingertips all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fundamental approach is to understand the physics of what's going on, and 
this is physics," he said, watching the ratcheting effect as he rubbed a thumb 
and forefinger slowly back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarton, an expert in the mechanics of vibrations and sounds -- not to mention 
biomechanics and physiology, led a team of seven fellow scientists at 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in a quest for synthetic ivory for piano keys. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York City piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons funded the $250,000 
study, along with the state-run Northeast Manufacturing Technology Center, 
starting in the late 1980s. The scientists' work began about the time a 
worldwide ban was going into effect on the sale or import of ivory, to protect 
endangered elephants from whose tusks it comes. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as the 1960s, piano makers were running short of ivory, and plastic 
had become the material of choice for keys on all but the most expensive 
instruments, according to Donald Dillon, executive director of the Piano 
Manufacturers Assn. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 But ivory keys have an advantage over plastic ones. Because it is bony matter, 
ivory is pockmarked at random with holes and tiny fissures. Like the tread on a 
tire, that porous texture provides traction for the fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're at Avery Fisher Hall . . . and you've got on a tuxedo and the 
lights are on and you're doing a Mozart concerto, you're sweating," Scarton 
said. "You also have oils on your hands. What happens is the finger will 
hydroplane, like a tire that hydroplanes when you go into a skid on a wet 
surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Scarton and the other lead RPI researcher, Sal Calabrese, assembled experts in 
areas ranging from synthetic materials to tribology -- the study of 
lubrication, friction and wear. 
</P>
<P>
 In 2 1/2 months, the team came up with the concept, Scarton said. Then came 
three years of fiddling with the materials to mass-produce the synthetic ivory, 
called RPIvory. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest procedure calls for the faux ivory to be hardened in nickel molds. 
A water-soluble powder -- polyethylene glycol, a form of antifreeze -- is mixed 
with the polyester solution and white dye to make the polymer resemble the 
color of keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the mold hardens it is immersed in water and the polyethylene glycol 
washes away. The places where the particles dissolve become the irregular pits 
and holes that simulate the porosity of ivory, Scarton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team received a patent last year for RPIvory. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinway has tried out the synthetic ivory on a few grand pianos and plans to 
put it on five other Steinway grands, said Daniel Koenig, the company's vice 
president of manufacturing. A discerning and demanding bunch, pianists didn't 
know what to say when told that the keys were an ivory substitute, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that it (RPIvory) has the touch and feel of ivory," Koenig 
said. "But from our viewpoint, for a commercial venture the jury is still out 
by a long shot on whether anyone would pay the slight extra cost" for the 
artificial ivory instead of the now-standard plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Steinway's deal with the RPI research team, the piano maker has 
exclusive rights to the synthetic ivory's use on piano keys. Scarton said he is 
weighing proposals for other commercial uses of the substance, such as on 
computer keyboards or the steering wheels of automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other piano makers have been hunting for ivory substitutes too, according to 
Frank Seta, vice president of the Cincinnati-based Baldwin Piano Co. Baldwin 
has worked for years with General Electric's plastics division, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are trying to find a product that will give us those positive 
effects of ivory but address the negatives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivory, he pointed out, was not perfect either. In addition to the supply 
problems, it tends to become brittle and to yellow as it ages. 
</P>
<P>
 But, undeniably, there is something about ivory that cannot be replaced by any 
plastic, polyester, ceramic or resin substitute, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a mystique to it," Seta said. "When you hear the word 'ivory,' what 
do you think of? Something like a diamond or gold. Very expensive material. 
It's quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Busch, an associate professor at the Crane School of Music at the State 
University of New York at Potsdam, estimated that 90% of Americans playing 
pianos would not know or care they weren't playing on ivory keys. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the other 10%, the piano aficionados or professionals, the allure of 
ivory remains strong, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with romance," he said. "When you are playing on ivory, you're 
playing the music of the past on the material of the past. Plastic is OK. Most 
pianos are made with plastic keys, and all musicians have pretty much adapted. 
But ivory is luxury."

HARRIED GRANDPARENTS EXPERIENCE PARENTING, THE SECOND TIME AROUND; LIFESTYLE: 
RESEARCHERS SAY DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE, TEEN PREGNANCY, UNEMPLOYMENT AND AIDS 
ARE LARGELY TO BLAME. WHEN PARENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO CARE FOR THEIR 
CHILDREN, THEIR OWN PARENTS OFTEN STEP IN.

 Tom and Mary Fron had dreamed about life after the last of their four 
teen-agers moved out: They would buy a cabin in the northern Michigan woods and 
spend weekends snowmobiling. Just the two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then 16-year-old Betsy, their youngest, announced she was pregnant, and the 
Frons soon found they were not grandparents, but Mom and Dad. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 They adopted Nathan, now 5, when their unmarried daughter proved too immature 
to care for him and moved out. The Frons shuffled their work schedules to avoid 
day-care costs. The money they had saved for a vacation cabin pays for Nathan's 
preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't give him up for anything," Mary Fron said from her home in Niles, 
Mich. "But there are wild days when he's playing his flute and has his dog 
romping with him in the house, and there is a smidgen of resentment that this 
isn't what I expected." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for baking cookies, reading stories and baby-sitting occasionally. 
Nowadays, being a grandparent can turn into a 24-hour-a-day job. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers say drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy, unemployment and AIDS 
are largely to blame. When parents are unable or unwilling to care for their 
children, grandparents often step in. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, almost 3.3 million children lived in a home maintained by a 
grandparent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Of those, 867,000 children -- 
or about 1.3% of the nation's youth -- lived with grandparents in homes where 
neither parent was present. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and Hispanic children, especially those living in cities struggling with 
crack cocaine and AIDS, are more likely to live in a home maintained by a 
grandparent. The Census Bureau found 12% of black children living in a 
grandparent's home, compared to 6% of Hispanic children and less than 4% of 
white children. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, about 60% of grandparents rearing grandchildren are white, and 
many are affluent, said Meredith Minkler, professor of public health at the 
University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandparent care cuts across class and ethnic group lines," Minkler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Child-rearing grandparents range in age from the late 20s to early 90s, 
Minkler said. Some grandparents are surprisingly young because they became 
parents as teen-agers, and so did their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom and Mary Fron, 47 and 46 respectively, are among the young grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the grandparents rearing children again are beyond the typical 
child-rearing age. Preliminary studies at Berkeley show more than half are 55 
or older, and one-quarter are 65 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 For the older ones, especially, serving as parents again "can really take a 
toll," Minkler said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is good news, however. As awareness of the problem grows, more help and 
advice are available for these grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Fron helped establish a network of support groups called ROCKING, or 
Raising Our Children's Kids: an Intergenerational Network of Grandparenting. It 
receives hundreds of calls and letters a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, the American Assn. of Retired Persons opened a Grandparent 
Information Center to help second-time-around parents cope with financial, 
legal and emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our first five months, we had over 2,400 calls or letters requesting 
help," said coordinator Renee Woodworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The AARP center offers tips ranging from how to find a baby-sitter to the 
advantages of adopting a grandchild. It also refers callers to more than 350 
local support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is asked most often about legal issues, such as whether a 
grandparent should seek court-ordered custody or go through a foster parent 
program, Woodworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many grandparents also need help with finances. Retirees may find their 
pensions and Social Security won't pay the new bills. Their health insurance 
often doesn't extend to grandchildren. They may be forced to move out of 
subsidized senior-citizen housing that doesn't allow children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it will mean not taking their medicine to buy their kids a pair of 
jeans," Mary Fron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the emotional stresses: Older care givers may feel isolated 
from friends their own age. But they don't feel comfortable among the young 
families at parent-teacher association meetings, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Some resent the loss of the traditional grandparent role. Some are racked by 
guilt because their children did not turn out to be good parents. 
</P>
<P>
 There is often self-doubt, and one overriding fear -- that their health will 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie and Morton Taylor of Duluth, Minn., 55 and 53 respectively, worry about 
who will care for their 7-year-old grandson, Patrick, if they don't live long 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we worry about is seeing him through high school, getting him raised, 
and keeping our health until then," said Jessie Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taylors fought their youngest son and his wife for legal custody of 
Patrick when they saw signs of neglect. He was 2 1/2 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrendous. It was awful," she said. "You pray the whole time that 
you're doing the right thing, and then you pray you can handle it all, to raise 
a child again."

RESCUING ALL CREATURES, SOAKED AND STARVING; MIDWEST: WILDLIFE CPR MADE A 
SPLASH DURING LAST YEAR'S FLOODS, SAVING CATS, A POSSUM, EVEN A SALAMANDER. NOW 
THIS ANIMAL RESCUE SQUAD HAS FOUND A PERMANENT HOME AND IS BUSIER THAN EVER.

 They made headlines last year saving the forgotten victims of the great 
Midwest flood -- the victims with whiskers, wings and webbed feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Mary Rotz and Jane Seitz are moving Wildlife CPR from their living rooms 
to 10 rustic acres in central Illinois. Selling two of their rescue boats and 
using four others as collateral, they bought the property for $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the two have cared for more than 1,000 animals, many of them 
endangered or threatened. The phones would ring with news of an owl caught in 
barbed wire, baby birds left homeless by a storm, a muskrat with an eye 
infection, a badger with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I've been doing this, my religion has been deeper, broader," said 
Seitz, who quit a full-time job so she could nurse animals and then return them 
to the wild. "Mary and I just never learned to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 But until last summer, the two had limited their mission to central Illinois 
and paid most expenses from their own pockets. Then a flood of historic 
proportions hit the Midwest; their tiny organization was never the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotz, Seitz and Jack Nuzzo, a former Boy Scout ecology director, began making 
300-mile round trips to the Mississippi River. They dived into murky water to 
rescue cats, grabbed a starving possum whose babies had drowned in its pouch 
and even raised a salamander to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 At first they hopped aboard Coast Guard boats to hunt for trapped animals, 
then bought two vessels of their own. The four others were donated. 
</P>
<P>
 As their work gained attention, more donations began to trickle in, including 
$5,000 from the International Fund for Animal Welfare. They still have to take 
money from their pockets to keep Wildlife CPR going, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very dedicated people who do a fantastic job," said veterinarian 
Thomas Burke, director of the wildlife clinic at the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 They do it for the animals, the kind of everyday wildlife that Nuzzo noted are 
sometimes overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids in school hear about elephants, pandas and giraffes," he said. "But they 
don't know much about the American bittern, a state endangered bird." 
</P>
<P>
 "God didn't make a useless animal," said Rotz, inspecting the wing of an 
injured pigeon. "There's a reason for them all."

YOUTH'S HOMETOWN BACKS CANING IN VANDALISM

<P>
 Michael Fay, the American youth sentenced to be caned in Singapore, got little 
sympathy in his hometown Friday where a poll found residents backing the lash 
nearly two to one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Michael Fay was my son, I'd cane the hell out of him myself," one resident 
told the Dayton Daily News, which conducted a call-in telephone poll on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 2,270 people who called the newspaper, 1,442 approved of the caning while 
828 did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had caning here in American schools, I bet children would listen to the 
adults and have respect for them. I say go for it!" a woman told the newspaper. 
"Cane every single one who doesn't have respect and I bet they'll learn real 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, 18, grew up in Kettering, near Dayton and his father still lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay was sentenced March 3 to six strokes of the cane, four months' jail and a 
fine of $2,000 for spray-painting cars and other offenses. He is in a Singapore 
prison pending an appeal for clemency on his sentence to President Ong Teng 
Cheong. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensely painful punishment, a common one in Singapore for crimes ranging 
from rape to vandalism, is administered with a split rattan rod that leaves its 
victims bleeding and sometimes scarred for life.

FLORIDA TO PAY VICTIMS OF '23 RACIST ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Florida Legislature decided today to compensate the victims of racist 
violence that wiped out the black settlement of Rosewood more than 70 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate passed a $2.1-million claims bill 26 to 14 to pay survivors and 
those who lost property, and create scholarships for the descendants of 
Rosewood's residents.The community near Cedar Key was burned down in January, 
1923, and at least eight people died in a rampage that began when a white woman 
claimed a black man had assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill now goes to Gov. Lawton Chiles, who has said he supports compensating 
the survivors. The state House passed the measure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the bill had originally sought $7 million. They said the state 
should acknowledge and make amends for an episode that occurred at a time when 
lynchings and other acts of racial violence were common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosewood has become a symbol of the countless secret deaths and atrocities 
that took place throughout this era," said Sen. Daryl Jones, one of the bill's 
sponsors. "It is time for us to make Florida fair to all of its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors will be eligible for up to $150,000 each if they can prove that they 
lived in Rosewood and were forced out by the violence.

2 SOUGHT IN SHOOTING OF BICYCLIST IN OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police are looking for two juveniles suspected of shooting and 
attempting to rob an 18-year-old Oxnard man while he was riding his bicycle 
about 6:30 p.m. Saturday in the 1200 block of Hull Place in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Ortiz was shot once in the left leg and once in the lower back, a 
Police Department spokesman said.He was treated at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center and is listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Details on the incident were sketchy, the spokesman said, but a witness 
reported seeing the victim and two others arguing on the street. As the 
argument escalated, Ortiz reportedly tried to ride away on his bicycle and was 
shot by one of the young men. The pair fled the scene, the spokesman said.

NEIGHBORS UNITE WHAT FREEWAY DIVIDED; SANTA MONICA: THERE'S A GROWING MOVEMENT 
TO REJUVENATE THE MULTIETHNIC AREA, WHERE MINORITIES OUTNUMBER WHITES 2 TO 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minnie Duncan McCauley was a toddler when her folks brought her to a sleepy 
little country town called Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1925. Santa Monica was mostly bean fields, lemon groves, and dirt 
roads, which turned into mudholes when it rained.  
</P>
<P>
 The Duncans came to California from Arkansas for the same reason as most: a 
better life. The difference was their skin color. And, as it turned out, that 
hardly mattered, they say, as they and their brood of 10 settled down as one of 
the community's early African American families. They found a town that, 
although not exactly colorblind, abided by a live-and-let-live philosophy that 
was unusual in that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Juarez arrived a year or so later from Texas, by way of Montebello, to 
work at a local brickyard that lured many Latinos. He raised a family of five 
and still lives in Santa Monica with his wife, Beulah. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Rosemary Romero Miano's family had been there for generations. 
She is a descendant of the Marquez and Reyes families that settled Santa Monica 
Canyon in the mid-1800s, living on a 6,000-acre Mexican government land grant 
called Rancho Boca de Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few decades, more minorities filtered into town and prospered, 
becoming tradesmen, merchants, teachers, secretaries, lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Belying the image of the Westside as an all-white enclave, African American 
and Latino families lived side by side with whites and Asian Americans, mostly 
in the city's southeast corner: the Pico Neighborhood, an area roughly bounded 
by Pico Boulevard, Centinela Avenue, Santa Monica Boulevard and Lincoln 
Boulevard. That's where the land was most affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 There were horse-driven hayrides to Malibu by moonlight and Mexican 
Independence Day festivals on Olympic Boulevard. Minority children went to 
school, rode the streetcar and attended Saturday matinees side by side with 
everyone else, practicing multiculturalism decades before the buzzword was 
coined. Pico residents didn't call it that, though. To them it was simply the 
good life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never sat in the back of nothing," McCauley, 73, said emphatically. "I 
didn't know prejudice, growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 But like many good things, the spirit of the Pico Neighborhood that McCauley 
and others recall so fondly didn't last. Though still a polyglot neighborhood 
with neatly kept bungalows, it has taken a battering since she romped through 
the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction of the Santa Monica Freeway in the late '50s to the mid-60s 
drove a stake through the heart of the neighborhood. Today, the sound of 
children's laughter has given way to gunshots as drug-dealing youth loiter in 
alleys. Many younger African Americans and Latinos now distrust each other, 
unaware of past alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 On streets where they once learned each other's language and customs, they now 
eye each other suspiciously and keep to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a growing movement is afoot to rejuvenate the only area in town where 
minorities outnumber whites 2 to 1, according to census figures. The idea, as 
exemplified in a city-sponsored cultural festival that ran last week, is to 
solidify the future by honoring the past. THE EARLY YEARS: "No one cared what 
color you had living next to you."  
</P>
<P>
 Though they grew up at opposite ends of town, the 1930s were wonderful, 
carefree years for Miano and McCauley, and they both remember them as filled 
with love, respect and food, but not much money. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did they come to Santa Monica? 
</P>
<P>
 The Depression was in full swing, but land was cheap. California offered a new 
start and, best of all, a more relaxed racial climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Its cool ocean air appealed to those used to the humidity of the South and 
Midwest. And as early migrants settled in, they told their friends and 
relatives about it. Some of them came West too. 
</P>
<P>
 Miano, now 71, grew up on part of the family land on Entrada Drive, where she 
still lives on one of the two remaining lots from the land grant. Her mother, a 
young widow, taught her English before she started school at Canyon Elementary. 
There were family picnics on the beach and in the shade of the sycamore groves. 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley walked through fields to junior high and to the library at night, 
picking guava off trees along the way. She helped her Mexican playmates with 
their English; her brothers learned Spanish in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to segregated school systems elsewhere, Santa Monica had one high 
school for everyone, a key factor in promoting tolerance, people agree. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the mid-1930s, when Beulah Juarez married her husband, Tony, a 
bricklayer, and came to town, they found comfort and acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nice little town where you could raise a family," said Beulah 
Juarez, now 83. "You could go to the beach at night and not lock your doors." 
</P>
<P>
 "No one cared what color you had living next to you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vabel Reed, 78, a longtime civil rights activist, was a young married woman 
when she came to Santa Monica from Texas around 1940 in search of a job. The 
daughter of a Howard University graduate, Reed hoped to get away from the 
stifling segregation at home, where blacks couldn't even use the same drinking 
fountain as whites.  
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Reed joined thousands of women who worked in factories. 
She worked the assembly line at Douglas Aircraft as a riveter and bought a 
bungalow that she still owns on Virginia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We faced some prejudice," the longtime civil rights activist said, recalling 
a department store that would not hire black clerks, "but not to the depths of 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the relatively benign past described by longtime members of 
Santa Monica's ethnic community, people of color did face barriers, in 
accordance with the laws of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, minorities could not buy property north of Montana Avenue, 
retired Santa Monica High School teacher Forrest Freed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed, a descendant of the Marquez and Reyes families, remembers his extended 
family attending a groundbreaking ceremony for a subdivision called Marquez 
Knolls. But a year later, when a cousin wanted to buy a lot, he was dissuaded 
from doing so by those marketing the tract. THE POSTWAR DECADES: "All of a 
sudden it became a black area and a Mexican area."  
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, things began to change. Soldiers from all over the country 
who had been stationed here during the war decided to settle in town. The land 
became more valuable. Tolerance, several longtime residents suggested, seemed 
to come easier when there was plenty of room for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came in and brought their prejudices," said Harriette McCauley, Minnie 
Duncan's daughter, who surmises that people who came here earlier, when it was 
a bold move, were more driven to put old ways behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the '50s would bring a mortal blow to the thriving multiethnic Pico 
Neighborhood, life was still sweet on the streets for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton Ricard, who had helped build St. John's Hospital in the '40s, in the 
'50s used his carpentry skills to build the Little League field where his five 
sons played on integrated teams, his widow said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the state and county governments were looking for a place to put the 
Santa Monica Freeway in the mid-'50s, it was the Pico Neighborhood they deemed 
expendable. Though officials denied it, people in the neighborhood believed 
that, as minorities, they lacked the clout to block the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway, which opened in 1966, literally cut the neighborhood in half and 
displaced some 600 families, mostly black and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 People lost their dream homes to eminent domain, and many middle-class African 
Americans moved to communities such as Baldwin Hills, while their counterparts 
in the Latino community headed for places such as San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Each group used to make up about 20% to 25% of Santa Monica's population. 
According to the most recent census, African Americans constitute 4.1% of the 
city's population; Latinos, 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to stop (the freeway)," said Vabel Reed. "Some of us stood in front 
of the bulldozer to stop it. We walked. We fought. We picketed. They 
overwhelmed us. After the freeway came, things started to go downhill." TODAY: 
"Everybody is fighting for crumbs"  
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s, the Pico Neighborhood is fighting for its life. The enemies are 
gangs, drugs, the breakup of the family and something that flabbergasts the 
old-timers: a breach between blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where does it come from?" said Vabel Reed. "This never was. We was always 
kind of kin." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, there are signs of gentrification as first-time 
homeowners seek affordable housing on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarik Ricard and Harriette McCauley, both officers of the Pico Neighborhood 
Assn., are trying to infuse others with community pride. "People here need to 
recognize they have the power to change the neighborhood," McCauley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricard said the breach between African Americans and Latinos has been fostered 
by a system in which both groups are competing for ever-dwindling resources. 
"Everybody is fighting for crumbs," he said.

WESTSIDE WATCH: THE TALE OF A MAN, HIS DOG, AND THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time -- actually, it was Feb. 10 -- Jonathan Bogner of West Los 
Angeles went for a walk with his 1-year-old son on his back and his 2-year-old 
dog, Juliette, at his heels. 
</P>
<P>
 As they passed a neighbor's house, the neighbor asked if Juliette was 
responsible for the doggie deposit on his lawn, Bogner said. 
</P>
<P>
 He denied it and kept walking, only to be surprised upon his return 25 minutes 
later to find a city of Los Angeles animal control officer demanding the 
immediate surrender of the white pooch. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor had reported that the dog was vicious. After arguing with the 
animal control officer, Bogner says, he declined to turn over the pooch and 
headed for home. There, he was even more surprised when two LAPD officers 
arrived a few minutes later and took him away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge: battery against the dogcatcher. Bogner says he never touched the 
dogcatcher, who -- he contends -- threatened him with arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was absolutely absurd when this man said, 'If you don't give me 
your dog, I'm arresting you and your baby,' " said Bogner, who produces 
children's videos and parenting programs. "I didn't touch him. My attorney and 
I are contending they made up the charge of battery in order to justify the 
arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Burns, district supervisor for the animal control department, said 
Thursday that he could not comment on the case. But at a hearing late last 
month, a representative of the city attorney's office decided to drop the 
charges of battery and walking the dog off her leash. 
</P>

<P>
 POSTHASTE: Tis the season for political junk mail in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tide of City Council campaign mail, we've noticed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bad spelling. Before the "Friends of Sal Guarriello" spent their money, they 
might have learned to spell his name. A mailer bearing his picture spells it 
"Guarrillo." Twice. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's cool to be a nerd. A Jeff Richmond piece includes an on-screen photo 
from his championship "Jeopardy!" appearance. Over five games, he won $58,302 
(the figure's on the screen) and, the mailer notes, made it to the show's 
Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Topless pics! Steve Martin appears in swimming trunks. He's waist deep in a 
pool, holding a "Save Our Pool" sign, along with three other people opposing a 
onetime bid to build a civic center at West Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Multiculturalism. Daniel Kovatch appeals to the city's Russian-immigrant 
voters by rendering his name and pitch in the Cyrillic alphabet, along with 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mother of All Mailers. John Heilman's eight-page piece is really a 
little book, with glossy photos and more text than a front page of USA Today. 
Anyone make it to the end?

IT'S A SMALL, SMALL WORLD; MUSEUM: CAROLE AND BARRY KAYE'S PRIVATE COLLECTION 
OF LILLIPUTIAN WORKS FINDS A NEW HOME AT A 14,000-SQUARE-FOOT SITE ON MIRACLE 
MILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Perhaps the Miracle Mile should be named Museum Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, it was reported that the Petersen Automotive Museum, a four-story 
facility devoted to automotive history, will open June 10 at Wilshire Boulevard 
and Fairfax Avenue, near the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the George C. 
Page Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Now another museum plans to open in the neighborhood: The Carole & Barry Kaye 
Museum of Miniatures, a private collection of Lilliputian works ranging from 
monogrammed flatware less than half an inch long to an ornate tea set that sits 
on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, to open June 1, will be an expanded, 14,000-square-foot 
reincarnation of the 3,800-square-foot Petite Elite Miniature Museum in Century 
City, which was scheduled to close Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials hope the miniature collection, together with the new 
automotive museum, will help revitalize the Miracle Mile portion of Wilshire 
Boulevard by drawing more visitors to the area. That effort may also get a 
boost, they say, with the renovation -- scheduled to be completed this summer 
-- of the Craft and Folk Art Museum, which is also on the Miracle Mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much a part of the county's strategy to make that a museum 
corridor," said Joel Bellman, spokesman for County Supervisor Ed Edelman, who 
represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The new museum and its predecessor, the Petite Elite, grew out of the 
enthusiasm of Carole Kaye, the museums' co-founder and curator for miniature 
art. She built a dollhouse with her grandson four years ago, she said, and 
found she enjoyed it so much that she eventually made six more by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The hobby soon grew into a business. Carole Kaye learned all she could about 
the world of miniature art and -- along with her husband, Barry, an estate 
planner who heads Barry Kaye Associates/Wealth Creation Centers -- attended 
shows of miniature works and met with artists. Later, she commissioned 
dollhouses by several artists.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got carried away," she said. "It became an obsession. We just kept 
collecting (miniatures)." 
</P>
<P>
 Her home, however, began overflowing with dollhouses, and her husband decided 
to display them in space next to his Century City office. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have used their own funds to add to the museum, which opened in 
August, 1992. They own most of the pieces, and have received others on loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Kayes' collection, the pieces, all made by contemporary artists, are 
tiny, but not the attention to detail. They offer intimate views of places, 
people and things -- all in small, but proportional scale. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a tiny chest with 600 pieces of wood inlay, highly detailed, 
miniature rooms made by the late Eugene Kupjack and his son, Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the pieces are minuscule. The collection, for instance, features 
historical figures by George Stuart, including an 18-inch piece depicting Louis 
XIV, and foot-long dioramas by Ray Anderson -- among them, a Southern 
plantation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the collection was cramped in its Century City location and tucked 
away in an area of corporate offices, the Kayes decided to set up shop 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection's new two-story home is at 5900 Wilshire Blvd., across the 
street from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's shop will retain the Petite Elite name and sell miniature 
furniture, chandeliers, porcelain, silver and other items, with prices ranging 
from $1.50 for a hand-sculpted, ceramic vegetable up to $4,000 for a 
hand-painted, five-piece bedroom set. Also available for sale will be an 
hourlong video tour of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility will feature Kupjack and Stuart galleries, exhibits with 
varied artistic themes and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also plans to display works by artists from all over the world. 
Among other works already in the collection are British and American 
dollhouses, a Japanese palace, a Western town, a winter wonderland, a 
snow-dusted Victorian mansion, and gargoyle-trimmed medieval abbeys. Also, 
displayed will be miniature versions of First Ladies' inauguration gowns and a 
miniature Fontainebleau Palace from France. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, there is a scene at the Hollywood Bowl featuring the Louis 
Armstrong Orchestra and celebrity guests including Count Basie, Ella 
Fitzgerald, and Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting June 1, visitors can examine the new museum's collection from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Admission 
will be $7.50, $6.50 for those 60 and older, $5 for students 12 to 21, and $3 
for children 3 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 10, the museum will be the site of a fund-raiser organized by the 
Malcolm Forbes Family, Carole Kaye said. All proceeds from the invitation-only 
party will go to the Elizabeth Taylor Foundation for AIDS.

GOOD GRIEF, IT'S A COMEDY

 Meet Grandma Sylvia's family. It's not a pretty bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 There's performance artist skyBoy (formerly known as Stewart) in red-tinted 
sunglasses and Reebok sneakers; gum-chomping Marlena, who totes Evian bottled 
water and a Gucci bag; Jerry, in patent-leather white shoes and a jungle-print 
shirt; Elsie, in a puffy vest resembling an ostrich dipped in lame and toilet 
paper dangling from her shoe; sobbing Melissa playing a tuneful Hatikvah on her 
violin; grandstanding Gary taking the opportunity to belt out a chorus of "My 
Yiddishe Mama," and Dori, in fishnets and skintight mini-dress, reading her 
tribute: "God couldn't be everywhere, so he invented grandmas." 
</P>
<P>
 They're all part of the fun at "Grandma Sylvia's Funeral," an interactive 
comedy that marked its 18th month last week at the Hudson BackStage in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-character piece follows in the tradition of such participatory theater 
works as "Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding" and "Barry Moses' Bar Mitzvah," with cast 
members segueing from their scripted dialogue for impromptu chatter with 
theatergoers. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences meet the colorful, bickering "family" as it lines up to enter the 
Helsenrott Mortuary, last resting place of Sylvia Schildner Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is the brainchild of actors Glenn Wein and Amy Lord, who were 
longtime cast members in the New York company of "Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding," 
which poked fun at the raucous nuptials of a young Italian American couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amy and I went to lunch one day and decided to create an environmental show 
for Jewish audiences," said Wein, who also directs "Grandma Sylvia" and plays 
grandson Gary. Some time later, when they were both in Los Angeles -- and both 
their grandmothers and many friends had died -- they got together and plotted 
an outline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed an outlet to express our grief, but in a comical, entertaining 
way," Wein continued. "We knew the parts of 'Tony 'n' Tina' that worked, the 
parts that were underdeveloped. What audiences liked most was the opportunity 
for intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Solemnity, however, is hardly the order of the day. From the creepy mortuary 
greeter (who stamps entrance passes with a Batman design and hisses to himself, 
"I hated the old lady") to Rachel (that's doctor Rachel), who offers an airy 
lecture on dysfunction and denial, the memorial service and reception are high 
on humor, low on philosophy. For energetic theatergoers, there's a chance to 
hit the dance floor with one of the chatty cast members. For hungry audience 
members, there is a well-stocked buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnicity is a strong component of the piece. The Yiddish flies fast and 
furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being Jewish and doing a Jewish show," said Wein, "we wanted a broad base of 
characters: wealthy Jews, poor Jews, assimilated Jews, the discarded first 
wives -- and the flashier, easier models that replaced them. In other words, we 
wanted to make some political points, and let the characters tell the story." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial cast was assembled by Wein and Lord with friends and people whose 
work they'd seen. The script was created through a series of workshops, 
brainstorming and storytelling among the group. Many of the characters hit 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, some are based on real people, some are composites," said Wein, 
who acknowledges his own mother was one of the "abandoned first wives." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most striking visual aspects of the show is the age range of its 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had very old, very sick people to the show," Wein said, "and they have 
a good time. I think it's been successful because it doesn't offend anyone. 
We've had Hasidim -- which surprised me because the show is so irreverent, a 
lot of black people, a whole party of Koreans. We have everything. You never 
know what you're going to get in the audience, which is great."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY: CITY COUNCIL SCRAPS PLAN FOR DOWNTOWN FARMERS 
MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have again shelved a plan to bring a farmers market to the 
closed off area of Washington Boulevard downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council has instructed city staff to pursue developing the 
half-acre site between Culver Boulevard and Main Street as a town square where 
such activities as outdoor art shows and festivals could be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing concerns about increased traffic and whether the site should be 
overlaid with a gravel-like substance, the council voted 3-2 last week to 
reject the farmers market at the closed-off area. City officials will explore 
other locations for such a market. 
</P>
<P>
 The city first proposed a market on the site in February. Council members 
voted to pave over the closed-off Washington Boulevard area to make room for 
the market. On March 14, however, the council reconsidered the idea because of 
concerns about the loss of grass. A farmers market on grass, said community 
development director Mark Winogrond, would be too expensive because of 
maintenance costs. Rain would also leave the ground muddy, making a mess for 
vendors and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Development Agency then proposed covering the grass on the site 
with "decomposed gravel," which is granite crushed to a gravel-like 
consistency. But council members last week balked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like walking on Kitty Litter," said Councilman Steven Gourley. "For 
God's sake, don't let them put that gravel there. Just make it attractive, a 
place where people want to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual operating cost of a farmers market, Winogrond said, would be 
$14,000, which would be paid by the city's redevelopment agency. The agency 
would derive $6,000 annually from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Winogrond pointed to the success of Santa Monica's farmers 
market, and said that holding a farmers market in the heart of Culver City 
would attract more people to the other downtown businesses. CAROL CHASTANG

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW: TEAM MAKES 6,000-MILE GOODWILL TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven members of the Dorsey High School track team went a distance that they 
never imagined they would: 6,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how far they traveled recently to run as a marathon relay team in 
South Korea. Yet the marathon, the first the students had ever competed in, was 
not the pinnacle of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race was a challenge," said 17-year-old Anthony Hinton, "but the real 
victory was seeing the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 At the invitation of the South Korea-based company Kolon International Corp., 
the group traveled to South Korea as goodwill ambassadors of Los Angeles' 
African American community. The delegation also included seven runners from 
Gardena High. Kolon representative Bronnie Lee traveled with the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to help try and bridge the gaps between the black and Korean 
communities," said Lee, credit manager of the Los Angeles division of Kolon, a 
billion-dollar import-export firm that manufactures a sporting goods line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was less about winning a race and more about bringing students together 
through cultural education." 
</P>
<P>
 Kolon picked up the $35,000-plus tab for plane tickets, food and hotel 
accommodations. The annual national marathon for high-schoolers pitted the two 
Los Angeles groups against 27 relay teams from South Korea, China and Japan. 
Although the U.S. group -- the first Americans ever invited to participate -- 
finished last, students said they were happy just to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey Coach Paul Knox, who along with Assistant Principal Beverly Clarkson 
accompanied the students to South Korea, said his team rarely runs more than 
three miles for an event. And none had ever run five-mile legs in a 26-mile 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 For Betty Butler, 15, the race was grueling but the trip was eye-opening in 
more ways than one. "I really enjoyed it. The Korean culture there is very 
different than the culture here." 
</P>
<P>
 During the students' six-day stay, Lee took them on whirlwind tours of 
museums, palaces, historical sites and cultural events in Kyong Ju, Korea's 
ancient capital city, and Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most impressive thing -- the school, the discipline," said 
17-year-old senior Anthony Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 The culture shock, from acquiring tastes for seaweed to learning that Korean 
business manners differ greatly from those of Americans, were not entirely new 
for Dorsey runner Cyrena Thomas, 15. Thomas' father is black and her mother is 
Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents were glad about this trip, because they always felt I should know 
that other side of my culture. Now I feel like I do." ERIN J. AUBRY

A NATURAL SETTING; * LIFESTYLES: STRIPPED OF THEIR INHIBITIONS, NUDISTS AT 
ELYSIUM FIELDS IN TOPANGA CANYON SAY THE SAFE ENVIRONMENT SETS THEM FREE. THE 
CAMP HAS ENDURED SINCE 1968 DESPITE EFFORTS TO SHUT IT DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On warm weekends, its grassy, eucalyptus-scented grounds are covered with 
naked men and women. Waitresses and teachers mingle with affluent couples and 
aging hipsters, their tanned bodies glistening in the sun. Some play tennis in 
nothing but sneakers. Others skinny-dip in the pool. Children romp across the 
lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 With the passage of time, the Elysium Fields nudist camp in Topanga Canyon is 
more quaint than risque. A product of the sexual revolution of the 1960s, it 
has survived prudish neighbors, prayer vigils outside its gates, and, until 
recently, persistent efforts by Los Angeles County officials to close it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few of the nation's 100 or so nudist camps have fallen on bad 
times, Elysium Fields -- like nude recreation generally -- thrives. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, where sex is prohibited, has become a popular venue for 
self-awareness experts spreading the New Age gospel. Parents take their kids 
there to explain the birds and bees. Women who wouldn't be caught in a singles 
bar swear by the secluded, eight-acre compound as a place to meet quality men. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were hoping for and fighting for in the '60s, people are more 
comfortable doing now," said Ed Lange, Elysium's 72-year-old founder and a 
former Life magazine photographer. Sitting on a veranda overlooking his domain, 
wrapped in a towel as a concession to the weather, Lange resembles a professor 
who has just stepped out of the shower. He is among the movement's elder 
statesmen, having spent four decades trying to demystify the nudist way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 As the publisher of nudist books and magazines, Lange has fought numerous 
legal battles, including one that led to a 1956 U.S. Supreme Court decision 
that granted second-class mailing privileges to nudist publications. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1950s, he persuaded Eastman Kodak to change its policy of refusing 
to return prints of nudes that were sent for developing. Later, he successfully 
challenged the publishers of Look magazine after they took exception to him 
calling one of his publications Nude Look. 
</P>
<P>
 He even scandalized daytime TV viewers in the early '60s by appearing -- fully 
clothed -- on "Art Linkletter's House Party" to promote the lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 26 years, his focus, and the source of his pride, has been 
Elysium Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled below a hill at the end of a tree-lined back road, Elysium is a rustic 
Shangri-La where visitors are encouraged to shed their problems along with 
their attire. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign on a towel rack beside the steam bath reads, "Leave Your Hang-ups 
Here." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no loudspeakers, televisions or radios. Patrons are invited to get 
in touch with their senses, to smell the grass, enjoy the fresh air, count the 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 On sunny weekends, when crowds number in the hundreds, the grounds are filled 
with couples and families with lunches spread on picnic blankets. People read, 
meditate, sunbathe, throw Frisbees. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a park scene like any other, except that, for the most part, the 
participants aren't wearing clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet eroticism is strangely absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small bits of clothing are far more seductive than nudity can ever be," 
explains a divorced fashion model, lounging in a lawn chair, her chin resting 
on her knees. She brings her young daughter whenever possible. "If I wanted to 
be leered at, I'd go to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Although uninhibited among themselves, many nudists remain wary about 
revealing their lifestyle to others, noting the lingering stigma associated 
with it. The model, for instance, didn't want her name revealed for fear that 
it would complicate a child custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think nudists were wackos," says Paul Stevens, 82, a Woodland Hills 
pharmacist who began coming to Elysium with his wife in the late 1960s and has 
continued since her death 10 years ago. "It's easy to ridicule something that 
you don't know anything about." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other nudists, he extols the lifestyle for its ability to break down 
ordinary social barriers. "Communication is easier when you're naked," he said. 
"Out of their uniforms, people are on a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 He tells of once talking to a pleasant man from England named Alex for nearly 
an hour "right here where you see me now" and not learning until later that he 
was Alex Comfort, the noted biologist and author of "The Joy of Sex." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the pool with Stevens this day was a brain surgeon, a prominent child 
psychologist and a former National Geographic photographer on his first visit 
to the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Kaufman, the newcomer, had brought his 5-year-old daughter to attend a 
Jewish Passover feast, among the numerous "clothed" events hosted by Elysium 
throughout the year. When his daughter insisted on swimming, he shed his 
clothes and joined her. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't meet any strange, weird or questionable characters," he said. "Nor 
did I see it in anybody's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 An oasis of tranquillity where the two most common status symbols -- cars and 
clothes -- have no currency, Elysium seems an unlikely target for the kind of 
campaign that forced Lange to spend an estimated $1 million in legal fees in 
order to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 "A less determined person would have walked away a long time ago," said Los 
Angeles criminal attorney Stanley Fleishman, whose clients, besides Lange, have 
included the publishers of Henry Miller novels and the exhibitors of the movie 
"Deep Throat." "Ed has stuck to his guns because of his beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Not until early last year, following a series of court reversals, did the 
county finally recognize the camp's right to exist. A political realignment in 
1991 had removed Elysium from the district of County Supervisor Michael 
Antonovich, a longtime foe. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp's troubles began almost as soon as it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from neighbors, deputies arrested Lange and two dozen 
other nudists on successive weekends in 1968, charging them with indecent 
exposure under a 29-year-old county law. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lange waged a successful legal battle to overturn the law, the county 
used zoning changes in an attempt to drum Elysium out of business. When that 
tactic also failed, the supervisors -- led by Antonovich -- asserted that the 
property was seismically unsafe to accommodate visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the complaints once lodged against the camp border on the comical. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Rohde, a Los Angeles civil attorney, still chuckles when recalling a 
courtroom exchange with an Elysium detractor, a woman whose house bordered the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'After dinner parties, do you take guests up to the attic with 
binoculars to peer over the eucalyptus trees?,' and she said, 'We don't do it 
all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although some neighbors still object to the nudist camp, local opposition has 
largely melted away. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Topanga Chamber of Commerce whose members once shunned Elysium now 
use its clubhouse for their functions. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the stuff that our opponents imagined was hidden was revealed to be 
nonsense," Lange said. "I didn't have a tail and horns and there were no orgies 
being conducted on the grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange became fascinated with nudism as a teen-ager growing up in Chicago after 
buying an early nudist magazine, Sunshine & Health, under the counter at a 
drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other young men drawn to the magazine because it was the only 
publication at the time to offer an unimpeded view of the female anatomy, he 
was more interested in the articles than the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resented guys in school who were only out to (score), and I resented girls 
who were only out to find a lifetime meal ticket," he said. "Unhealthy 
attitudes about sex and the human body seemed to drive each group." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoning Chicago along with his strict Baptist upbringing, Lange moved to 
Los Angeles in 1940. He found work as a set designer and free-lance 
photographer and renewed his interest in nudism just when one of the movement's 
pioneer West Coast leaders came under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Besieged by hostile newspaper accounts and under pressure from authorities, 
Lura Glassey was on the brink of losing her popular Elysia nudist park in the 
hills above Tujunga in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Herald-Express printed stories hinting at "unspeakable orgies" 
behind the "impenetrable walls" of Elysia. In 1939, county supervisors passed a 
law effectively prohibiting the practice of nudism in the county -- the same 
law that Lange was later responsible for overturning. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply, Elysia's female members took to wearing G-strings. But when an 
unsuspecting sunbather dropped hers to go skinny-dipping, sheriff's deputies, 
peering through binoculars, swooped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Glassey was arrested. As her case languished in court, she was forced to sell 
the property and close the nudist park. Through the ordeal, Lange was one of 
her strongest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me angry," he said. "From that point on, my dream was to some day 
open my own camp and do something to improve conditions for nudists." 
</P>
<P>
 The nudist philosophy is simple: To be nude is to be natural. It isn't that 
nudists are opposed to clothes. They simply believe that clothing restricts the 
full enjoyment of nature and outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite adage is: "Clothed when practical, unclothed when possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Once regarded as nut-eating, berry-chewing exercise fanatics and treated as 
social lepers (outsiders often even referred to their gathering places as 
"colonies"), nudists by tradition have tended to be socially conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement was created in an environment of fear where to acknowledge that 
you were a sexual being was to imply that you were a pervert of some kind," 
Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his former wife, June, set about to change what Lange refers to as 
nudism's "puritanical streak" when they formed the Sundial Club for nudists out 
of their Hollywood apartment in the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the movement were dismayed when a stunningly attractive club member, 
Diane Webber, posed for Playboy and later became one of the most photographed 
female sex icons of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudist sensitivities were also tested with the opening of Elysium Fields, with 
its more libertine rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Elysium allowed touching, frowned upon at other camps. Professional masseurs, 
unheard of in the nudist world at the time, were added to the staff. And 
Elysium was designated as "clothing optional," a departure from camps that 
required guests to disrobe before getting past the entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say such changes have helped make nudism more acceptable to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place represents a different attitude toward sexuality," said Art 
Kunkin, who gained notoriety in the '60s as founder of the Los Angeles Free 
Press, the nation's first underground newspaper. He works for Lange part time 
as publisher of Journal of the Senses, an Elysium quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a full-fledged nudist ("I'll take off my clothes to go in the 
pool"), Kunkin was attracted to Elysium as a kind of truce zone where men and 
women relate to each other without being caught up in the sexually infused 
gamesmanship involving fashion and possessions. "People here aren't abusing one 
another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the example of Esalen Institute, the personal development center 
near Big Sur, Lange introduced a curriculum of personal growth seminars -- 
including yoga, diet and fitness experts, psychological counselors and 
herbalists -- and promoted them in his own as well as non-nudist publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elysium has been on the cutting edge in any number of ways," said Debra 
Peterson, an official with the American Sunbathing Assn., the nation's largest 
nudist group, with 44,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Long content to keep a low profile, that group now actively promotes nudism by 
sending speakers to civic clubs and to trade and travel conventions, places 
Peterson insists "would have been out of the question just a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 At Elysium, the membership roll recently topped a record 1,400, and Lange 
anticipates a new growth spurt now that the threat of closure has dissipated.  
</P>
<P>
 Like nudist camps everywhere, Elysium strives to keep a balance between men 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's established that if the balance gets out of kilter, both men and women 
start to feel uncomfortable," says Norm Swirin, a librarian who moonlights as 
the camp's tennis coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp leaders say that currently, 65% of members are men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a requirement, male enrollees are encouraged to bring their wives 
and girlfriends, with discounts provided for couples. Besides the $200 annual 
dues, members pay daily grounds fees that range from $9 to $14, depending on 
the season and the day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sessions for prospective new members are held three times a week. A staff 
member gives the newcomers a tour, lays down what few rules there are ("Don't 
violate others' personal space; use a towel when sitting") and tactfully seeks 
to weed out voyeurs from those genuinely interested in nudism. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the weather is lousy, a few people usually show up. 
</P>
<P>
 On one such day recently, a weekday morning, three men came, including Don, a 
young UCLA graduate student, and Carl, a retired insurance salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Don said he learned of the place after meeting a young woman at a shopping 
mall who had an Elysium bumper sticker on her car. By the end of the day, he 
was eager to share the experience with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl, who was visiting from Florida, had slipped away from his wife on the 
pretext of sightseeing. And that was exactly what he was doing. "She wouldn't 
go for this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Lesley, Elysium's executive coordinator, insists that people who come 
for the wrong reasons usually don't return. "They see what goes on and the type 
of people here and we usually don't see them again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley, a former ballet dancer, recalls her first day at Elysium 10 years ago 
with mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressed from the demands of motherhood and her job as a network TV censor, 
she had been admonished by a doctor to find somewhere to unwind. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend suggested Elysium Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You're kidding, how do you get naked with a whole bunch of people?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Her first husband, the late film director Nicholas Ray, had been a private 
nudist, shedding his clothes after coming home from work the way some people 
toss their shoes. It was not something she cared for. 
</P>
<P>
 But her friend was persistent. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls mustering the courage to walk out of Elysium's ladies room after 
disrobing. "I whispered, 'Let's go somewhere up the hill where nobody will 
notice us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the stack of TV scripts she had brought from the office were abandoned. 
"I discovered for the first time in my life the pleasure of being totally 
unfettered, like a baby," she recalled. "It was extremely liberating."

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * WORK DAY -- Approved participation by all city employees in "Take Your 
Daughter to Work Day" on April 28. The event is designed for girls age 9 to 15 
to observe the working world. 
</P>
<P>
 * VENICE ART WALK -- Authorized the Department of Transportation to post 
temporary no-parking signs on the east side of Main Street between Westminster 
Avenue to Club House Avenue from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May 14 for the art walk.

 * TICKET AGENCIES -- Approved a motion expressing support for a bill in the 
state Assembly that would impose stiff fines on ticket agencies that fail to 
provide tickets to customers who have paid in advance. The bill, which would 
impose penalties up to $50,000, stems from an incident at the 1994 Rose Bowl, 
when a ticket agency failed to provide tickets to dozens of fans from Wisconsin 
who had already paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
 * METRO RAIL STATIONS: Approved the appropriation of $500,000 to enhance three 
Metro Rail stations along Wilshire Boulevard at Western, Normandie and Vermont

FOR SENIORS; CONCEIVING A MORE NURTURING WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her book "The Child of Your Dreams," Laura Huxley writes: "Look at the 
whole picture: a baby continuously and irrevocably present in your life. Not 
just for one hour, for play and fondling; not just for a pleasant afternoon of 
relaxation; not just for a day, as an exquisite gift of life; but day, after 
day, after day -- and night, after (sleepless) night." 
</P>
<P>
 Huxley, 82, is appalled at the conditions under which some children live and 
is convinced that if only people would more seriously consider the decision to 
have a child, a great deal of human suffering would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Huxley -- author, therapist and lecturer -- is the widow of Aldous Huxley, 
best remembered for his novel "Brave New World." She will celebrate the 
centenary of his birth with a conference this month titled "Children: Our 
Ultimate Investment" at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the conference is to instill such thoughts in people. The birth of 
a human being, Huxley believes, is the most important happening in society -- 
an event for which one must prepare physically and emotionally, intellectually 
and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceiving an infant is not to be taken lightly, Huxley says. Her organization 
supported a day-care center in Santa Monica where teen-age boys and girls 
volunteer a few hours a day and learn how much responsibility is involved in 
minding children. (It recently closed, although she is ready to open another if 
she could find the funding for it). "A teen-ager taking care of a 2-year-old is 
prevention against pregnancy," Huxley said. "(The teen-agers) are exhausted at 
the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Huxley does not believe women should raise children on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can a single mother, barely getting by, fight the gun lobby, the 
cigarette manufacturers, the liquor industry, violent television and inadequate 
education? So much is against her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huxley talks about children, she speaks with the sensitivity of a loving 
mother, although she never had children of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 43 when I married Aldous. I knew I would have to stop everything else 
in my life if I had a child, and I didn't want to stop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for being married to a scientist and artist with one of the first-rate 
minds of the 20th Century, she said: "It was easy to be married to Aldous. He 
was not neurotic. He was someone who could delight in my ideas too." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Huxley, who lives in the Hollywood Hills, was born in Turin, Italy. From 
age 10 until 26, she trained as a concert violinist. She made her Carnegie Hall 
debut as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still self-involved but much wider," she said, "still greedy for life, 
but everything is fascinating -- especially finding a very simple and effective 
way to do away with complications. I feel I would be an accomplice to the 
cynics by not doing positive or creative things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would betray myself if I believed nothing could be done. I do believe much 
of human suffering can be prevented." 
</P>
<P>
 Huxley's concerns include the elderly. And she has a dream that the 
generations will bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envisage on every city block a serene, soundproof, pastel-colored room, 
furnished only with comfortable rocking armchairs and pillows. This is a 
caressing room where the new and the old will meet and loneliness will 
dissolve," she wrote in a 1978 preamble for Project Caress, one element of a 
nonprofit organization she created for the "nurturing of the possible human." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, 60 years after her husband wrote about the danger of overpopulation, 
propaganda, inadequate health care and pollution, Huxley celebrates his birth 
by offering a conference that asks for a lot more than ideas. It's a call to 
action and solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldous Huxley died on the same day as John F. Kennedy. Both men left a legacy 
of ideas that can flower in a thousand fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldous Huxley wrote in "Island:" "Never give children a chance of imagining 
that anything exists in isolation. Make it plain from the very beginning that 
all living is relationships. Show them relationships in the woods, in the 
fields, in the ponds and streams, in the village and in the country around it. 
Rub it in." 
</P>
<P>
 To live in a world where cynics are taken more seriously than idealists is 
diminishing to the human spirit. Where the Farrakhans and Limbaughs rush in to 
nourish hate and envy, Laura Huxley says: Why not something beautiful, gentle 
and loving? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the future be a "Brave New World" without vision or an "Island" composed 
of a loving society? 
</P>
<P>
 The Aldous Huxley Centennial will be April 28 through May 1 at the Wilshire 
Ebell Theatre, 743 Lucerne Blvd. Information: (213) 461-8248 or (213) 461-8976.

HOT PROPERTY: 'ODD' MAN OUT OF RANCH LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-time Emmy-winning actor JACK KLUGMAN, who last fall reprised his 1970s 
TV role of Oscar Madison for the CBS TV movie "The Odd Couple: Together Again," 
has put his Temecula horse ranch on the market at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of behind me now," he said of the 38.6-acre El Rancho de Jaklin, 
where he has kept as many as 110 horses, including his prize-winning 
thoroughbred Jaklin. "I bought the farm (in 1980) because of him. He was very 
exciting, but now I just want to keep one or two horses . . . and I want to 
concentrate more on acting." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides portraying the sloppy roommate of fastidious Felix Unger (played by 
Tony Randall) in "the Odd Couple" series and TV movie, Klugman, 71, starred for 
seven years, until 1983, as the crusading coroner in the NBC series "Quincy." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he was a regular on sitcoms, specials and the stage until he had a 
vocal cord removed during 1989 surgery for throat cancer, caused by smoking. 
Then Klugman couldn't speak above a whisper until he worked with a voice coach. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of scream therapy, Klugman appeared in one Broadway performance 
of "The Odd Couple" and then made the TV movie, which aired last fall. Now he 
is about to go on tour with "The Odd Couple" to benefit Randall's repertory 
company. "It will be great fun," Klugman said. "We'll be hopping around, going 
to a number of cities. I'll see a lot of racetracks." 
</P>
<P>
 He has about a dozen horses now, including Jaklin, and he plans to board out 
the ones he decides to keep after he sells his ranch with its 7,500-square-foot 
mansion, which he had built; four smaller houses; barns, paddocks, pastures, 
tennis court, pool and spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Klugman also has a beachfront condo in Malibu, where he'll live after he sells 
the ranch, listed by Gene St. Amand with Coldwell Banker Johnson & Johnson, 
Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never move out of California," Klugman said. "It's a wonderful place 
to live, even with its fires, mudslides and earthquakes. I was evacuated during 
the fires . . . but there must be some risks in life. When I see the ocean 
here, I'm just glad to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 MADONNA has sold her former residence in the Sunset Strip area for about $2 
million, sources say. Escrow closed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, where she lived for about four years before moving last fall to her 
new home in the Hollywood Hills, was purchased by Madonna's tenant, producer 
Dan Melnick, who leased the house last November at $10,000 a month, sources 
said then. Melnick was a producer of the films "L.A. Story" (1991), "Roxanne" 
(1987) and "Footloose" (1984). 
</P>
<P>
 The gated, 4,500-square-foot home, with three bedrooms, was originally listed 
last September at just under $3 million. Madonna paid about $3 million for the 
home in 1989, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Offenhauser of Jon Douglas Co., Beverly Hills, had the listing, and 
Barry Peele of Fred Sands' Directors Office represented Melnick. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL JUNGER WITT and SUSAN HARRIS, the married-couple partners at 
Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions -- one of the most prolific teams of producers 
in television -- have purchased a seven-acre estate in Montecito for slightly 
more than $5 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate, which had been on and off the market for five years, was 
originally priced at $7.2 million. The house is said to be in need of a major 
rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has red-flocked, velvet wallpaper in one room, lime green wallpaper in the 
next, and you must go through some rooms to get to others, but the house is in 
a nice location," a local realtor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt-Thomas-Harris, which includes Tony Thomas as a partner, has been 
responsible for such hit TV shows as "Golden Girls," "Blossom" and "Empty 
Nest." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was in dire financial straits as a single mother one year short of a 
college degree and no job history when she wrote and sold an unsolicited sitcom 
episode in 1970. Since then, she created, wrote and produced "Golden Girls," 
"The Golden Palace," "Nurses" and other shows, winning an Emmy in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides co-producing his company's shows, Witt, who married Harris in 1983 and 
is the father of her second child, produced the TV movie "Blossom in Paris" 
(1993), "The John Larroquette Show" TV series, "Final Analysis" (1992) and 
"Dead Poets Society" (1989). 
</P>
<P>
 Former syndicated talk-show host and singer MIKE DOUGLAS has put his Beverly 
Hills house on the market at $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7,000-square-foot home has five bedrooms plus maid's quarters, a pool and 
a five-car garage. The French Country-style home was completely rehabbed a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas and his wife have lived there for about six years but are looking for 
a home in the same neighborhood with a larger yard for their dogs, said listing 
agent Bruce Nelson of John Bruce Nelson & Associates, Beverly Hills.

CONDO Q&A: WHAT CAN BE DONE IF BOARD BREAKS RULES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Our condominium association has 200 units with pools, tennis courts 
and other amenities. Our annual budget is about $1,000,000 and we have about 
$1,000,000 in our reserve funds for future repair and replacement of major 
components of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent board election, the campaign was a nasty one. Negative stories 
about the previous board appeared on the front page of a local newspaper. 
Owners of multiple units were taken to lunch by the proxy gatherers, and 
lawsuits were threatened against the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The new controlling majority, three of the five board members, were elected 
through a well-organized proxy collection effort. They include an attorney, a 
wealthy real estate investor and another person who always votes with the 
attorney and the investor. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, the new board fired the management company that had 
performed well for five years. The new management company appears to do 
whatever the majority wants, even though it is in violation of the 
association's legal documents or state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Your column has warned against many of the actions that the board has taken. 
For example, reserve funds are being withdrawn with only one board member's 
signature and without any board discussion. In the last four months, our 
reserve funds have been depleted by $100,000 even though no reserve 
expenditures have been discussed or approved at a board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Our association's declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions 
(CC&Rs) requires accrual accounting methods for our financial records. The new 
management company switched to cash accounting methods and changed the chart of 
accounts. We are now six months into the contract year and the management 
company has not been able to produce a single financial report in time for 
review at the monthly board meeting. They blame the prior management company's 
lack of proper records. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any board discussion, the law firm that was handling our foreclosure 
procedures for delinquent assessments has been dismissed. The association now 
uses a non-judicial procedure for foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Please answer the following questions: Does the association's board have an 
obligation to comply with the legal documents? Does a manager with the 
Professional Community Association Manager designation have an obligation to 
comply with the law? When professional "wheeler-dealers" take control of the 
board, what can an owner do? What protection is available other than expensive 
legal action? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The board of directors has almost all of the power and authority in a 
community association. That is why the election of directors is so important. 
The owners should be very careful to elect people who are known to be fair, 
honest, competent and loyal to the common good. 
</P>
<P>
 Once elected, the board has an obligation to comply with state laws and 
enforce the governing documents of the association. Accurate financial records 
must be supplied to the board so that they can review actual expenditures and 
income and compare the association's current financial status with the budget. 
State law requires that the board review accounting records and bank statements 
at least every three months. For an association of 200 units, this should be 
done at each monthly board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Accrual accounting provides a more complete picture of the association's 
finances since it shows accounts payable as soon as the obligation is incurred 
and income is accounted for as soon as it is billed. Cash accounting, on the 
other hand, does not take into account any unpaid bills that may be 
accumulating without the board's knowledge. In my opinion, accrual accounting 
is better, especially for a large association such as yours. That is probably 
why your association's CC&Rs require the accrual method. However, some 
management companies do not provide accrual accounting. These companies say 
that, as long as the annual review or audit is performed using accrual 
accounting methods, they are in compliance with the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Board meeting minutes must be kept of any and all important board decisions, 
especially firing attorneys, changing assessment collection procedures and 
approving reserve expenditures. If these decisions are being made in between 
board meetings, California Corporations Code, Section 7211(b), gives specific 
procedures: "Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be 
taken without a meeting, if all members of the board shall individually or 
collectively consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or 
consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board." In 
other words, all board members must not only participate in the decision, they 
must all agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding your manager's failure to provide timely financial reports, this is 
a serious problem. The change in management companies should not delay the 
printing of financial reports. The reports do not have to balance with the 
prior management company's records. The new management company starts with the 
current status of the assessment billings, accounts payable and the current 
bank balances to prepare their reports. 
</P>
<P>
 After a management change, an audit should be conducted by a licensed 
accountant who is experienced in community association accounting. The audit 
will clear up any discrepancies in the accounting records. 
</P>
<P>
 Your manager's Professional Community Association Manager (PCAM) designation 
means that he or she exhibits a professional level of education and experience 
and that the person has agreed to abide by a professional code of ethics. In my 
opinion, the manager is causing or allowing the association to be in breach of 
the law and he or she is in breach of the PCAM professional ethics if financial 
reports are not being provided on time and reserve funds are being used without 
proper signatures and without documentation in the board meeting minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The PCAM Code of Professional Ethics requires that the PCAM accept only those 
contracts that he or she can perform with professional competence. A complete 
copy of the ethics code can be obtained from your local chapter of the 
Community Associations Institute. A written complaint about the performance of 
a PCAM can be sent to Barbara Byrd-Lawler, executive vice president, at the 
national CAI office, 1630 Duke St., Alexandria, Va. 22314. 
</P>
<P>
 California Civil Code, Section 1365.5(b), states that the withdrawal of 
reserve funds requires two signatures, either two board members should sign or 
it is permissible to have an officer who is not a member of the board and a 
board member as the signers. The manager should be aware of this law and, in my 
opinion, he or she should inform the board in writing if reserve funds are not 
being handled properly. 
</P>
<P>
 In your letter, you have accused some of your board members of being 
wheeler-dealers, but you and the other owners have elected them and you are the 
only ones who can remove them from power. Unless there is criminal action, 
there is no state agency that oversees the operation of community associations 
after the original developer has completed the project and turned it over to 
the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to talk with an attorney who specializes in community association 
law. If the election was unfair, or if you can prove that deception or proxy 
fraud was involved, you can petition the superior court to review the voting 
records and possibly the election will be set aside. Your petition must be 
filed within 11 months of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 If a majority of the owners are now displeased with the board, the owners can 
petition the board for a recall election. I do not recommend board recall 
because bickering and resentment last a long time after the battle is either 
won or lost. Even if a board recall is successful, it is almost always 
detrimental to the association in the long run. You can decide if the board's 
illegal action is serious enough to attempt to unseat them.

AT HOME: CITY STYLE WITH LAID-BACK OCEAN ATMOSPHERE; OCEAN PARK: HILLY SANTA 
MONICA COMMUNITY WITH TRENDY SHOPS IS CALLED 'SAN FRANCISCO IN LOS ANGELES' BY 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTIANE KESSING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Kessing is a free-lance writer who 
lives in Santa Monica.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ocean Park resident Dorothy King steps out on her veranda in the morning, 
she is welcomed by a dreamlike vista. Past the green leaves of a huge palm tree 
she overlooks the Pacific Ocean, its waves still veiled by cotton-like mist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although just eight blocks south of bustling Wilshire Boulevard, the community 
of Ocean Park in the southwest corner of Santa Monica has beach-town 
atmosphere. Often described by residents as "San Francisco in Los Angeles," 
Ocean park boasts hilly terrain, cool breezes, galleries, sidewalk cafes and 
trendy shops. Charming turn-of-the-century Victorian homes contrast with 
contemporary, resort-style condos. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find a combination of city living and the laid-back feeling of a small 
town here," King said. "It's a pleasant neighborhood to walk in, and everything 
is in walking distance. I hardly take my car out of the garage." 
</P>
<P>
 King, 71, moved to Ocean Park in June with her dog, Pauley. The retired high 
school English and history teacher sold her house in West Virginia, shipped her 
furniture and found a new home in Ocean Park. 
</P>
<P>
 She paid $145,000 for a newly remodeled one-bedroom, 720 square-foot 
condominium on Fourth Street. The three-story condo complex has elevators and a 
swimming pool. "I got more for the dollar here than every other place," King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than one square mile in size, Ocean Park is bounded by Pico Boulevard on 
the north, by Marine Street on the south, by Lincoln Boulevard on the east and 
the Pacific Ocean on the west. The middle- to upper-middle class community's 
more than 11,000 residents are primarily Anglo with Latinos as second largest 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Among beach-goers and surfers, the area is best known for its white sandy 
shores. Gourmets from all over Los Angeles flock to Ocean Park for upscale 
restaurants like Wolfgang Puck's Chinois, Rockenwagner's and Gilliland's Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Tree-lined Main Street is the community's commercial and cultural heart. It 
features a charming collection of architectural styles that tell about Ocean 
Park's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting out as a sleepy colony of summer homes in the late 1800s, the 
community soon emerged as the most popular beach resort in Southern California. 
Once the Santa Fe Railroad extended its tracks to the area in 1892, sun-seeking 
tourists and profit-seeking investors swarmed the area. By 1900, Ocean Park was 
booming, featuring an amusement wharf, golf links, business buildings, a school 
and even a race track. 
</P>
<P>
 Visionaries among the community's then 750 residents planned to show the world 
a model city. Activist Dana Burks, in an interview with The Times in September, 
1903, said: "We propose to make Ocean Park the best lighted city in the United 
States. . . . Pure food regulations will be enforced strictly. . . . City 
officials will serve without pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a couple of years, real estate prices jumped from a few dollars an acre 
to $15,000 for a small lot. California bungalows, practical little homes on a 
tiny plot of land, shot up like mushrooms in Ocean Park. Soon the popular 
bungalow became the symbol of the good, middle-class life many Easterners hoped 
to find in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time buyer Chris Meloni paid $530,000 two years ago for his California 
bungalow just one block from the beach. The 32-year-old actor, who played Frank 
Fanelli on the NBC show "The Fanelli Boys" and just finished the movie "Clean 
Slate" with Dana Carvey, immediately fell in love with the 1907 home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked for a unique house in a unique neighborhood. I found both in Ocean 
Park. There are only four blocks like this in Los Angeles," Meloni said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy jogging and bicycling at the beach or the lazy stroll down Main 
Street. It has a really neighborhood feeling to it. We even close off our 
street once a year and have a block party with a barbecue and pony rides for 
the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The community's Bohemian ambience has long attracted a wide variety of people. 
"Heterogeneity is the catchword for Ocean Park," said Adam Blumenstein, realtor 
with Jon Douglas Properties Estates. Home prices range from $99,000 for a 
one-bedroom, fixer-upper condominium to $1.2 million for a contemporary 
beachfront villa. An average single-family home currently sells for about 
$360,000. The median price for a condo runs about $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The diversity of the real estate reflects the diversity in the community. 
"Ocean Park has an edge to it because it is a mixed neighborhood. That makes it 
interesting to live here," said Daphne Dennis, who moved to Ocean Park 13 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis, a social services planner for the City of West Hollywood, and her 
husband, John Given, a real estate planner for the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, paid $240,000 for a two-bedroom, 2,500 square-foot California 
bungalow on Sixth Street in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1915 bungalow's cornered back yard serves as playground for Samantha, the 
couple's 6-year-old daughter. "She is a real outdoor kid," said Dennis. "She 
plays soccer in the local parks and roller-blades at the beach. We are lucky to 
live in a community where Samantha and her friends can do all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha is a first-grader at the Santa Monica Alternative School House 
(S.M.A.S.H.), one of Ocean Park's two public elementary schools. "We chose 
S.M.A.S.H. mainly because of its smallness and the community involvement. The 
180 students are like a family. We love it, " said Dennis. The alternative 
school house offers cross-grade-level grouping and written evaluations instead 
of letter grades. 
</P>
<P>
 A more traditional approach is found at John Muir Elementary School, which 
Diane Goodwin, a strategic planner in her 30s, and her husband, Browne, a 
consultant for Metrorail, chose for their son Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel is a fourth grader at Muir, one of the smallest schools in the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District. "John Muir is a fine school, enriched by 
the economic and cultural diversity of the community," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin rented in Ocean Park for several years and moved to a condo in the 
community before buying the a turn-of-the-century Craftsman home with a back 
yard six weeks after her son was born in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ocean Park has a wonderful mix of people. It's not only diverse but 
intellectually stimulating. People here are real, not superficial," said 
Goodwin. "There is a sense of community to preserve Ocean Park. We never even 
thought about moving away." 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for longtime Ocean Park resident Evelyn Williams, 73. She's 
lived in the community since 1946, when her family left a coal-mining town in 
Ohio in search for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ocean Park has always been great. When we came here right after the war, we 
were into dancing," Williams said. "Ocean Park Pier with its casinos, clubs and 
big bands was the place to go. I still enjoy walking along the beach."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, Williams and her husband, Kenneth, a salesman for Wonder Bread, 
bought a two-story, four-bedroom Victorian for $22,500. "I loved the house the 
moment I set foot in it. It has a feeling of stability that is characteristic 
for Ocean Park," Williams said. "Even nowadays I know all my neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Close-knit contacts among neighbors are the reason for the slight downward 
trend of crime in Ocean Park while crime is up nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actively promote Neighborhood Watch programs and encourage people to get 
to know their neighbors. In Ocean Park, residents and businesses are very 
involved in the prevention of robberies and burglaries," said Gary Gallinot, 
chief's adjutant with the Santa Monica Police Department. One problem remains 
the homeless, who committed almost 40% of the robberies and burglaries in the 
community last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who raised her children in Ocean Park and now watches her 
grandchildren grow up here, still feels safe. "I leave my door open like in 
1946 when I first came to Ocean Park. Where else can you do that?" she asked.

YOUR MORTGAGE; REVAMPED LOAN IS BOON FOR FIXER-UPPERS 
</P>

<P>
 Attention first-time home buyers and small-scale real estate investors: The 
most cost-effective -- but least-known -- federal mortgage program in the 
country has just been made even more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 With a series of user-friendly rule changes, the Clinton Administration has 
pushed "203k" mortgage insurance onto center stage for anyone interested in 
affordable housing. Picture a program that gives: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First-time purchasers the ability to acquire a house with zero down 
payment. You read that right: Zero. Zip. No equity money down. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Non-first-time home buyers the ability to finance a dwelling with a 
mortgage that's bigger than the current appraised value of the property. For 
example, you might have an "as-is" appraised value of $100,000 and walk away 
with a mortgage of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Investors the right to stack the full costs of renovating a fixer-upper 
property on top of the regular acquisition costs of the house -- all for a 15% 
down payment that the investor can recoup with substantial profits in a matter 
of months. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound too good to be true? Not if you get up to speed with the Federal Housing 
Administration's new and improved 203k program. Although on the books for years 
as the federal government's primary financing vehicle for home renovations, 
203k never produced many loans because lenders considered it an administrative 
nightmare. Barely a handful of mortgage companies nationwide ever bothered to 
offer it to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until the Clinton Administration's team at the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) decided to rescue it, streamline it and turn it 
into a high-volume housing producer. With the administrative revisions 
inaugurated last week, HUD expects a network of hundreds of lenders nationwide 
to actively promote 203k -- almost certainly including mortgage firms in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 How does 203k work? The basic premise of the program is that one of the best 
sources of affordable housing for moderate-income purchasers is fixer-uppers: 
Homes that need work and are priced or valued below their potential as a 
result. Put on a new roof, install a new heating system, modernize the kitchen 
and apply a coat of paint and the "handyman special" that everybody has passed 
by turns into a hot property. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for fixer-upper purchasers -- whether owner-occupants or investors 
-- has always come in financing the renovations. Lenders typically have 
required buyers to come up with large down payments and to finance the rehab 
expenses separately from the "as-is" acquisition cost of the house. Only after 
all the repair work was completed might lenders be willing to provide a 
permanent mortgage on the renovated house. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter 203k. It allows borrowers to roll the as-is price of the property and 
the cost of the future renovations into one loan upfront. Even better, it 
extends highly favorable FHA down payment terms to the entire package. Although 
frequently that can mean a down payment of just 5%, the 203k program takes the 
low down payment concept a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 For what the government defines as "first-time buyers," the required down 
payment can go to zero. First-timer for 203k, by the way, doesn't necessarily 
mean you've never owned a house before. Rather you simply cannot have owned a 
home during the three years immediately preceding your 203k loan application. 
And if you've been divorced or separated for less than three years, don't 
worry: You qualify as a first-timer as long as you no longer have an ownership 
interest in a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this example of a zero-down deal provided by Ann L. Johnson of 
Tidewater First Financial Group of Springfield, Va., an active 203k lender. Say 
a small-scale investor or renovator locates a rundown townhouse needing $20,000 
worth of repairs. The as-is, unrestored price of the place is $70,000. Total 
acquisition costs are projected at $90,000. The investor puts down 15% 
($13,500). If the investor were going to retain the property for rental, a 
$76,500 loan ($90,000 less $13,500) would be the maximum mortgage allowed under 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the investor planned to sell the renovated house to a first-time 
buyer, the loan ceiling could be considerably higher. Let's say an FHA-approved 
appraiser estimates that after the renovations, the home would have a resale 
value of $125,000. Using what FHA calls the "escrow commitment procedure," the 
investor could then qualify for a maximum loan of $119,250. 
</P>
<P>
 After completion of the renovations, the investor would allow a first-time 
buyer to take over (assume) the $119,250 loan for no cash down payment. The 
investor could either waive the $5,750 down payment altogether or take back a 
second mortgage note. The buyer, of course, would have to qualify financially 
to handle payments on that size mortgage debt. 
</P>
<P>
 At loan closing, from the $125,000 sale price, the investor would get the 
$13,500 he or she originally put down, plus a "profit" of $29,250 (the 
difference between the $119,250 ultimate loan amount and the $90,000 
acquisition and renovation costs). 
</P>
<P>
 Sound intriguing? To get information on the 203k program, plus the names of 
participating lenders in your area, contact HUD at (202) 708-2720. Or write for 
the 203k brochure from HUD-203k, 451 7th St. S.W., Washington D.C. 20410-3000.

 My house has been sitting on the market for six months. It won't sell; what 
are my options? 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a down market, real estate experts say that price and condition are 
the two most important factors in selling a home. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the first step is to lower the price. Also, go through the house and see 
if there are cosmetic defects that you missed and can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sellers should make sure that the home is getting the exposure it 
deserves through open houses, broker open houses, advertising, good signage and 
a listing on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). 
</P>
<P>
 If the seller is using a real estate agent and the property isn't getting that 
exposure, find another agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is to pull the home off the market and wait for overall housing 
conditions to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, frustrated sellers who are forced to sell because of a divorce or 
financial considerations, could discuss a short sale or a deed in lieu of a 
foreclosure with the mortgage lender. But these would be considered more 
radical options than lowering the price. Other Sources:

TO REPAIR OR TO REPLACE?

 "For a hole in your roof or a whole new roof . . .," that's the catchy slogan 
of a large Los Angeles roofing company. It's also a dilemma faced by the 
leak-plagued homeowner. If you don't have any idea how old your roof is, how do 
you know when it's time for a new one? 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be tricky," admitted Joe Peyton of Ford Wholesale Co., a large roofing 
supply showroom in El Monte. "If you've got several leaks and can't quite 
pinpoint a source, you can end up spending more money to repair it than it's 
worth." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to understand, too," he said, "that a contractor will have to 
charge you for the time-consuming job of looking for the source of the leak." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyton estimates that a repair job can cost about a third the cost of a new 
roof. He said that often the homeowner will wind up paying for a new roof 
anyway a few years down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 But some roofers, like Richard Silverman of Silverman Roofing in Santa Monica 
say a leak or two doesn't have to mean immediate replacement. "I go to people's 
houses where the person has been told he needs a new roof. I look at it and 
sometimes find you can buy time with some repairs. If I can do it for them, I 
will because roofs are so, so expensive. And a limited budget is a big 
consideration for some people." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Petersen of Angeles Roofing in Los Angeles says a good roofer can usually 
tell when the old one's had it just by looking. "Sometimes it (an asphalt roof) 
just crumbles -- you can see all the waterproofing has come off, with a wood 
shake or shingle you see them curling up and coming off." 
</P>
<P>
 The key is to find a roofer you can trust who will tell you when it's time.

TEAR OFF OLD ROOF OR NOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LAGATREE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may be faced with the decision of whether to remove your old roof or lay 
the new one on top of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tearing off the old roof can be messy, and it can add from several hundred to 
$2,000 to the total cost of your roof job. But it may be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Vanderslice of Roofing Forensics in Yorba Linda says unequivocally, 'Yes, 
tear off the old one. Typically you're replacing a roof that's leaking. So it's 
common to find problems with the structure -- dry rot, termite damage and so 
forth." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowner wouldn't discover these problems until they had become major 
headaches if he put the new roof over the old, Vanderslice said. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be other problems associated with keeping the old roof in place. 
Catherine Carlisle's Redondo Beach home was reroofed by the previous owners, 
who put a new shake roof over the old wood shingle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the contractor didn't extend the new roof beyond the edge of the old. 
Whenever it rains, water runs in, saturating the bottom wooden layer. This has 
weakened the original roof and caused decay. "Our roof has monster molds 
growing along the entire edge and no doubt underneath. We're just praying the 
roof doesn't cave in until we're ready to remodel," Carlisle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other factors, such as the added weight of the old roof and the 
difficulty in finding any leaks that may come up with the new roof, should also 
be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Vanderslice, "A leak in the new roof is hard to find because no 
longer does the water run straight down, it meanders through the old roof 
system. How do you know where to begin? You wind up patching here and there, 
hit or miss and hope you've got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes local building codes dictate whether you must remove one or more old 
layers of roofing before installing the new material. The uniform building code 
allows three layers. But some cities may be more restrictive than that. 
Glendale adheres to the code -- except in city-designated fire zones. Those 
homeowners must remove existing wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities, such as Culver City, require tearing off. Some manufacturers may 
require removal of roofing as part of their warranty agreement. Be sure you 
read the manufacturer's installation specifications and product warranty. (See 
story on warranties on Page 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware that the tear-off job is a frequent source of problem between 
homeowner and roofer. Some contractors hire "tear-off crews" who come in and do 
only that part of the job. In some cases, they neither warn the homeowner about 
nor take precautions of their own to avoid the huge amount of dirt and debris 
the job creates. The debris can become a fire hazard when it winds up in places 
where it is difficult or expensive to remove -- like attics or crawl spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the contents of garages -- from car to cartons of Christmas 
ornaments are inundated with dirt, wood chips, nails and occasionally even 
cigarette butts and pop tops, leaving the hapless homeowner enraged and 
frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do decide on a tear off, talk to your contractor about the potential 
mess, get it in writing that he is responsible for clean up and haul-off of the 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
 And above all, make sure you get it in writing that the contractor is 
responsible for tarping your roof in case of rain. Spell out in your contract 
that he will be liable for any damage that might occur, should it rain while 
you're roofless. KIRSTEN LAGATREE

SELECTING CORRECT ROOF FOR YOUR HOME, AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LAGATREE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your concern about fire-safe roofing will depend, to some extent, on where you 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Some municipalities dictate what material you may use. Los Angeles and 
Glendale, for example, ban even treated wood shake and shingle roofs. Other 
cities, Long Beach, for example, leave wide latitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, you'll get the most for your money if you know a thing or two 
about fire ratings. "I'm very pro-fire prevention, but don't get snowed by a 
Class A fire rating," said Bill Teie, former deputy director for fire 
protection in the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are using it as a sales gimmick -- but that's just a part of the 
picture. It should be just one factor among many," Teie said, adding that 
keeping dead and flammable brush cleared at least 30 feet around the house is 
just as important as having a fire-safe roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Teie believes factory-treated shake and shingle roofs, which come in either B 
or C ratings, can be adequate for certain locales. Former State Fire Marshal 
James McMullen agrees -- to a point. "The issue with shake and shingle roofs is 
that the untreated type have spread fires . . . " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen said that even the fire-conscious homeowner with a Class B treated 
wood roof can pay a terrible price. "A firefighter in a difficult situation 
goes first to those homes he can save with the resources he has," McMullen 
said, explaining that in a desperate situation beleaguered firefighters will 
sometimes turn away from wood-roofed homes because they have no way of knowing 
whether they're fire safe (and therefore savable) or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire ratings are given based on tests that simulate what can happen to a roof 
in a fire. The first and lowest rating is no classification. Untreated shake 
and shingle fall into this category. Next come the A, B and C ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the test for a Class A rating, a 12-inch-square piece of burning wood is 
put on the roof. If the wood doesn't burn through, the roof gets a "Class A" 
rating. To earn a B classification, a roof must withstand two smaller 
(6-inch-square) burning brands. Class C rating is given when 20 1 
1/2-inch-square brands burn out before igniting the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an irony involved here," Teie said. "The rating is to prevent fire 
from getting into the house through the roof. But I would say 90% of home fires 
in this nation are internal. Statistically, they start most often in the 
garage, in the kitchen, or in the attic," he said, adding, "I personally feel 
that if you get a roof rated B, you more than adequately meet the wildland 
threat if you're in an area with brush, grass and timber." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire ratings can have a significant impact on the cost of a roof. For example, 
untreated shake costs about $123 a square (100 square feet equals one 
"square"). That price jumps by nearly $40 a square for Class B and by $50 a 
square for Class A. 
</P>
<P>
 But safety and cost are not the only considerations that will affect your 
choice of fire classification in roofing material. Next year two tough new 
state fire laws will supersede less restrictive municipal codes and narrow the 
choice somewhat. One law, authored by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell, requires 
Class C ratings on all new construction -- and whenever more than half the roof 
is to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a more far-reaching law written by Assemblyman Tom Bates calls for 
the Department of Forestry to map high fire-hazard areas throughout the state. 
Municipalities will be allowed input on their classifications, but once they've 
accepted or modified their rating, all local jurisdictions in designated high 
fire zones must require Class B roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, untreated shake and shingle roofs will be outlawed by 
mid-1995, as will Class C treated shake and shingle. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, your best bet is to start with a call to your local building and 
safety department to find out what is allowed and what isn't.

A WORD ON BOTH WARRANTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 You're going to have to read some small print on this one. Many a sadder but 
wiser homeowner has learned the hard way that the most important thing to know 
about a warranty is what you are not getting. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you should know that your job will entail two separate warranties: one 
from the manufacturer on the roofing material, the other from the contractor on 
his workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 The stated duration of a material warranty can be misleading because the 
warranty is usually pro-rated. Simply put, this means that if you have a 
20-year warranty and the roof has a major problem in 10 years, you only get 
half the value of the original cost. 
</P>
<P>
 You should also know that the material warranty is generally dependent on 
installation being done according to the manufacturer's specifications. Many 
contractors don't even read the specs, said Mark Vanderslice of Roofing 
Forensics in Yorba Linda, an independent consulting firm.

 While material warranties are set by the manufacturer and are not usually 
negotiable, the warranty from your contractor very likely can be. For one 
thing, often the labor warranty is not well spelled out. Some contractors won't 
even volunteer one. Others will only offer language that vaguely guarantees 
labor for a certain number of years. But it may not cover the cost of the 
materials he'll need -- even if he's at fault in the installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Protect yourself by specifying in writing that the contractor will bear the 
cost of labor and materials to eliminate all leaks if a problem other than 
accidental damage results within X number of years. Typically contractor 
warranties are for anywhere from one to five years. But don't be snowed by a 
long labor warranty, warned Vanderslice.

LAGUNA TOUR SHOWS VISITORS THE WORK OF ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Trudging over sodden grass, they marveled at the setting: brilliant flowers 
and hand-tiled walkways leading to bungalows that hid intricate, original 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Mercer hurried them inside her one-room cottage overflowing with 
sparkling, plastic jewelry. Andy Wing whirled them through his bright, airy 
home-studio, showing off collages featuring household items. Then they went 
farther into the canyon, to Bob Bonn's immaculate work space, where colorful 
Southwestern images brighten white walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that in Laguna, there's an artists community, but I don't know 
how many translate that into a real little village where you walk down grass 
pathways between the houses and the studios," said Kevin Dorse, a Glendale 
attorney who was one of about 40 participants in Laguna's third annual Artwalk 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This, to me, is an amazing discovery. This is the difference between being an 
outsider and being an insider," Dorse said of the daylong tour. "Even if you go 
to (a gallery) opening and the artist is there, it's a pretentious setting; 
it's all business. Here, the artists are so inviting. It's more real." 
</P>
<P>
 Intended to give collectors, tourists and nearby residents a chance to see 
artists in action and talk with them about their work, the Laguna Artwalk is 
modeled after a similar event started in Venice 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Venice Artwalk, which raises money for a local health clinic, the 
Laguna Beach version is simply a cultural event that promotes local art and 
artists. Each participant pays $60 to peek into the life and work of seven 
different artists -- including glassblowers, silk-painters, leather-cutters, 
mask makers, painters, sculptors and potters -- and enjoy a gourmet Chinese 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on Dorse's tour enjoyed frank talk with such artists as Mercer, who 
welcomed the guests out of the rain saying, "I think you're all very, very 
brave," then rewarded them with complimentary pieces of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer, 41, took up ceramics as a bored psychology major when she became 
mesmerized by the process of throwing pots. After a stint as a commodities 
broker, she took her $68 in savings and started making jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then she has been featured in Nordstrom's Christmas catalogue and has 
opened her own shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go work at the 7-Eleven and scrape together $68 and start a business 
that eventually will become very successful. Mine did," Mercer giggled as she 
showed the crowd how she makes her funky plastic pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to Mercer, Wing's house also overflows with art, most of it his. The 
bathroom is a full-fledged gallery, with an intricately tiled tub and a 
eucalyptus branch to hold the shower curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining-room table started as a slice of a redwood tree but now has chunks 
of mirrors and enamel embedded in its surface. Just inside the front door hangs 
a decorated steering wheel; nearby, a rusty pair of scissors is the centerpiece 
of a collage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wing is a true believer in recycling. Among his latest works: a 
three-dimensional painting made from the plastic bands that come with each 
morning's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as an accident in my realm," said Wing, a tall, 
eccentric man with white hair and a beard. "It looks like all my work is 
accidental, but all accidents are choices sort of made in an accidental way."

'ONE STRIKE' SEX OFFENSE MEASURE DRAWS PRAISE, SCORN; POLITICS: THE BILL, 
CARRIED BY STATE SEN. MARIAN BERGESON, WOULD PUT RAPISTS, CHILD MOLESTERS 
BEHIND BARS FOR LIFE AFTER THE FIRST CONVICTION. CRITICS SAY IT MIGHT PRODUCE 
UNINTENDED EFFECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The awful facts are straightforward, simple. She was the victim of a brutal 
rape. The assailant was caught and convicted on 28 counts involving 11 
different women. He received 153 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Catherine Christie who feels like the one serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Orange County woman continues to salve the emotional wounds she 
suffered in the 1988 attack, her anger has grown over society's attitude toward 
rape. Though her attacker will probably never leave prison, Christie learned 
that such stiff sentences are the exception rather than the rule in California, 
where rapists average less than five years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like others, I will live with the effects of this rape for the rest of my 
life," Christie said. "It only seems fair that perpetrators should face the 
same consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 She might soon get her wish. Buffeted by gusts of anti-crime sentiment 
sweeping the state in this election year, the Legislature is considering a "one 
strike" measure that would put rapists and child molesters behind bars for life 
after a first conviction. It would be the strictest such penalty in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, carried by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) at the 
behest of Gov. Pete Wilson, has been championed forcefully by victims of rape 
and molestation such as Christie, who came forward with several others last 
week to provide compelling personal testimony at a televised Capitol public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' policy is not to identify rape victims, but Christie's name is 
being used in this story -- with her permission -- after she was publicly 
identified at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 While Christie and other boosters suggest a "one strike" law would mete out an 
appropriate penalty and could help begin to curb rape and molestation, 
opponents contend the proposal goes too far, representing a dangerous precedent 
as the state and nation grapple with how best to get tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that Bergeson's bill would send incarceration costs skyrocketing 
and, in cases of date rape or incest, have a chilling effect on victims, 
witnesses, jurors or even prosecutors -- potentially making it more difficult 
to put sex offenders behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say the measure blindly boosts penalties to the limit instead of 
carefully ratcheting up sentences for varying sex crimes, which run the gamut 
from lewd behavior to the most savage of rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the drafting of penal law, this is the crayoning in of punishments 
on an apparently arbitrary basis," said Franklin Zimring, a professor of law at 
UC Berkeley. "Penal law reform has become a branch of the theater of the 
absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Most critics blame the effort on election-year politics and pent-up public 
rage over crime. And in recent weeks, rape has became a top story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A public outcry erupted last month over the parole of Melvin Carter, a serial 
rapist eventually released in rural Modoc County. In Claremont, residents 
protested plans to parole a convicted rapist in their community; their hopes 
were answered at least temporarily when he flunked a psychiatric test and was 
kept behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson absorbed a dose of public abuse for the Carter parole but has used the 
"one strike" bill as a powerful retort. When gubernatorial opponent Kathleen 
Brown blamed him for Carter's release, Wilson responded with a television 
commercial ripping the Democrat for misunderstanding California parole law and 
citing the "one strike" bill as proof he is tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, the Republican governor has barnstormed the state touting the "one 
strike" bill to boost both his crime credentials and his stock with women 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But some women's groups, most notably the National Organization for Women, say 
the "one strike" measure would make rape reporting and convictions less likely. 
Wilson stalwarts, meanwhile, suggest NOW's opposition stems from a different 
motivation -- the group has endorsed Brown in the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the motivations, critics contend the "one strike" bill remains an 
election-year caricature of careful legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that politicians feed on crime hysteria to help themselves 
get elected," said Francisco Lobaco, the American Civil Liberties Union's state 
legislative director. "That's the unfortunate reality of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents tried to water down the Bergeson bill during last week's Senate 
Judiciary Committee hearing. Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) attempted to add 
language drawn from Democratic legislation that would essentially make only the 
most heinous crimes subject to a "one strike" penalty of life in prison. An 
uneasy Bergeson pulled the bill back and asked for more time to work with 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are legitimately concerned about public safety and tired of repeat 
offenders who seem to be inadequately punished," Lockyer said a few days later. 
"But I want the Legislature to produce a statute that's appropriate and not 
overreact because it's fashionable (to pass harsh crime laws) in an election 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson and officials in the governor's office remain resolute, saying they 
won't compromise on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will have the votes to move a strong bill," Bergeson said. "The 
bottom line is we release 250 convicted sex offenders from prison in California 
each month. To me, that is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson contends a tough "one strike" measure is needed because most 
perpetrators of sex crimes are repeat offenders who rarely respond to 
rehabilitation. "I don't want to give them a chance at that second victim," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say evidence demonstrates otherwise. A 15-year study concluded in 
1988 by the state Department of Justice found that about 20% of all sex 
offenders were arrested again for a similar crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer and others suggest the statistics paint an ominous scenario -- the 
"one strike" bill might unnecessarily incarcerate for life the four of five who 
would not likely commit another sex crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the bill's opponents dispute that repeat rapists and molesters with a 
penchant for violence deserve to be put away for life. But they express 
concerns about handing out such extreme punishment for every sex crime 
conviction, suggesting a blanket life sentence for all might produce unintended 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In less sensational cases, juries may acquit defendants if they believe the 
penalty doesn't fit the crime, critics contend. Prosecutors, meanwhile, may be 
more reluctant to press charges, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 People assaulted by friends or family -- particularly in incest cases -- might 
refuse to cooperate with authorities once they learned of the possible 
consequences, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Such qualms have prompted some prosecutors to quietly voice reservations about 
the current draft of the Bergeson bill. Even as devout a crime fighter as Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren, who agrees certain sex crimes demand a life sentence, has 
expressed concerns to Wilson that the bill might discourage the reporting of 
some cases, particularly molestations. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would impose a life sentence for an offense such as spousal rape 
that may currently be charged as a misdemeanor. A molesters who forcefully 
fondles a child under the age of 14 through his or her clothing also could be 
put behind bars for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should marital rape be considered more serious than unaggravated 
first-degree murder, attempted murder, mayhem?" Zimring questioned. "Having 
relations with someone under 14 is a serious crime, but is it worse than 
murder?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, rape and many other violent sex crimes are punishable by 
sentences ranging from three to eight years for a single count. Lobaco of the 
ACLU contends those terms are tough enough, particularly because rapists often 
serve consecutive prison sentences for multiple convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others worry because rape and molestation have among the highest rates of 
false arrests, increasing the odds that innocent people could be incarcerated 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimring, for one, finds it troubling. "All around us," he said, "we're having 
this enormous debate about recovered-memory cases and in the middle of it up 
walks the governor with a proposal to make incest a crime punishable by life in 
prison without the possibility of parole." 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters of the "one strike" bill, however, contend that such arguments 
shouldn't eclipse the most pressing reality they see: that sentences for rape 
and molestation aren't tough enough.

STUDIO CITY; REVITALIZATION: SANTA ANA IS HOPING THAT A PLANNED ARTISTS COLONY 
IN A DEPRESSED AREA DOWNTOWN WILL SPUR COMMERCIAL GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For now, the buildings that line 2nd Street sit mostly vacant, their pillars 
and grillwork testament to a grander epoch in downtown's history. 
</P>
<P>
 But the elaborate architecture of the Santora Building, the Grand Central 
Building and the Old City Hall, among others, may soon teem with new life: a 
fledgling Artists Village with galleries, Bohemian-style cafes and studios 
where artists would work and live. 
</P>
<P>
 To city officials, who have climbed on board the project, the village promises 
revitalization of a depressed stretch that will spur commercial growth and feed 
off the influx of potential consumers the new federal courthouse is expected to 
bring to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 To county artists who have long nurtured the vision, the village will bring 
them out of isolation, sparking new collaborations. And Santa Ana -- gritty, 
diverse and rich in history -- provides a perfect laboratory for the new 
colony, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the unexpected rub together, then you get new things. You get sparks. 
Ideas are born. People start cooperating," said Don Cribb, president of the 
Santa Ana Council of Arts & Culture and the visionary behind the artists 
community. "I hope it draws disparity together. To me it's a crucible." 
</P>
<P>
 Unresolved issues remain: While Santa Ana city officials are taking steps to 
ensure the plan moves forward, they concede that the financing remains up in 
the air for certain projects key to its success. And some Latino artists who 
only recently heard about the plans for an artists community question why their 
opinions have not yet been sought. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overall response from many touched by the project is a buzz of 
excitement -- an incredulous belief that a creative heart for Orange County's 
emerging artists is now seriously in the making and may get underway by early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is happening in Santa Ana! It's not happening in Irvine. It's not 
happening in Newport Beach," said Randy Au, a ceramic artist who heads the 
Santa Ana Studio Artists Assn., launched four years ago as the vehicle to make 
the live-work concept a reality in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of going next door to borrow a cup of sugar, you're going to go over 
to borrow a tube of cadmium paint. Hopefully, people who paint will collaborate 
with people in theater or in music." 
</P>
<P>
 The project should succeed, Au said, because almost everything an artist could 
want is already nearby: a library, City Hall, restaurants and stores lining 
bustling 4th Street, coin-operated laundries, and even a multicultural 
bookstore.  
</P>
<P>
 Slapped against the window of Au's current studio near the train station in an 
industrial stretch of Santa Ana is a poster teasing the times to come and 
comparing Santa Ana to New York's art scene.  
</P>
<P>
 "SoHo? So What," it reads in playful letters designed by Santa Ana advertising 
consultant Joe Duffy to look raw and home-grown. "We have grungy work space in 
drafty old buildings right here in Santa Ana. What we don't have are 
bone-chilling winters. Or a butt-numbing 2,400-mile drive to get here. Need 
more reasons to move in?"  
</P>
<P>
 Members of a planning committee, including Cribb, Au, architect Ernie Vasquez 
and city staff and council members, have traveled to Portland, Los Angeles and 
San Diego to check out other artist colonies. A market study commissioned by 
the city and completed in February stamped the project "viable."  
</P>
<P>
 The village "anchor" -- the Orange County Center for Contemporary Arts -- is 
fixing up its new home at Sycamore and 2nd streets recently purchased with 
financial help from the city. The building is undergoing extensive renovations 
that should be completed for an opening by next January, said Mike McGee, 
president of the OCCCA board and the art gallery director at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton is submitting a proposal to convert one building in the 
area into studio and living space for graduate art students and is considering 
a satellite gallery there and offering extended education courses, McGee said.  
</P>
<P>
 And the city is in the process of buying the old Handlebar Saloon, another 
historic building along the 2nd Street Walkway, blocked to traffic for more 
than a decade, for an as-yet-undecided use. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope that once the anchor tenants get up and running, the 
project will snowball. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we make these key investments, we should be able to step back and enjoy 
the fruits of our labor," said Cynthia Nelson, executive director of Santa 
Ana's Community Development Agency. "We're prepared to make commitments that 
will be the catalyst to get the project off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nelson said it was unclear how the Cal State Fullerton project would be 
funded. "We need to step back and figure out what we can afford to do first," 
she said. "We have no money. They have no money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can do things that don't cost money," she added, such as modify zoning in 
the area to make it specific for live-work space, which the city expects to do 
by July.  
</P>
<P>
 The persistent force and vision behind the project is Cribb. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cribb moved back to Santa Ana from Los Angeles after a long break, he 
said he felt restless, energized by the spontaneous Los Angeles art scene. He 
started searching for Santa Ana's culture and, much to his surprise, found that 
there was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four theater and dance troupes make the city their home, and Cribb's 
Santa Ana Council of Arts & Culture, founded in 1988, represents two dozen 
artistic organizations. The idea for a center with studios where artists could 
afford to live and work came from local artists, and Cribb became their voice, 
promoting the cause to city officials until they were sold on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laguna Beach has all but given up the opportunity to be a creative center. 
Land is too valuable. There is no spirit of creativity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana doesn't identify itself with one small slice-of-life experience. It 
has everything. You have all kinds of people from different ethnic backgrounds, 
rich and poor, from different educational levels. Orange County is giving birth 
to its first true city." 
</P>
<P>
 A live-work space with affordable rent has been a dream for artist Jeffrey 
Frisch, who now lives in a cramped one-bedroom Irvine condominium filled with 
his multimedia sculptures, pieced together with the discarded objects of urban 
life. Frisch ponders the Santa Ana village and the years he has waited for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent so many years a while back as an artist isolated. Here there's a 
whole sense of a community developing," said Frisch, director of the Orange 
County Center for Contemporary Arts and one of the village's biggest fans and 
promoters. "My only frustration is that it's not happening faster. It's the kid 
in me coming out. I want it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Jimenez, executive producer of the recently formed Tropical Music Channel, 
is also eager to be part of the new colony. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second floor of the Santora Building, a splendor of baroque 
architecture with iron grillwork and curved glass, Jimenez paces the grandiose 
lobby explaining his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still negotiating with city officials about where he will place his 
offices. But he plans to participate in the village by bringing to it a piece 
of the information superhighway: a high-definition television broadcast channel 
featuring the music of more than 40 Caribbean island nations, and another for 
Christian music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fiber-optics -- what a new medium for expression," said Jimenez, who sports 
wild black curls and a pair of sneakers he painted in green, yellow and red. 
"We are not going to leave the artists village area!" 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, who learned of the artists village after he decided to move downtown, 
wants to augment it with even bigger plans of his own. On the wall of one 
office he has occupied since November is a drawing of a four-story 
Inter-American Cultural Center, complete with two- and three-story reliefs of 
Aztec, Inca and Mayan figures that would be commissioned to local artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is not without skeptics, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the county's Latino artists are angry that they have largely been left 
out of the planning stages. The market study commissioned by the city polled 
two focus groups of artists, and Rosa M. Huerta-Williamson, chairwoman of 
OCCCA's exhibitions committee, says none were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we ever get a true picture of the community's needs if the community 
isn't included? Santa Ana is 65% Mexican. How could there not be one damn 
Mexican that was included in that?" she said. "I think the artists village will 
be a good thing for the county if they include Mexicans, because the Mexican 
people need a cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say that in the future they want to have an open door to anyone who 
wants to get involved in the colony.  
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this whole project is to bring the whole community together, 
not to be divisive," Frisch said. "I wouldn't put a nickel's worth of energy 
into it if I thought it was going in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio O'Cadiz, an Orange artist who designs murals, facades and reliefs to 
accompany architectural projects, said he learned of the village only recently 
and was disappointed that more Latino artists weren't initially included. 
Still, he is eager to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this is a good possibility," he said. "We are a community of creative 
people who don't have a place to get together."

BACK TO THE FUTURE; ARCHITECTURE: L.A. CONSERVANCY TOUR WILL VISIT MODERN 
BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTED BETWEEN 1945 AND 1964, A UNIQUE, OPTIMISTIC PERIOD, GUIDE 
PETE MORUZZI SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Touring Los Angeles with Pete Moruzzi is like traveling with a fervid believer 
on a pilgrimage through a holy land. In his case, the religion is Southern 
California architecture in the 20 years after World War II, and the shrines 
include the Capitol Tower, the Cinerama Dome, the Palmdale House apartments and 
Ship's coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I love most about them is they reflect an extremely playful, 
experimental time in American history. It was a unique, brief, optimistic 
period in American history, especially in Los Angeles," said Moruzzi, a 
32-year-old computer marketer who has become a missionary for Modern 
architecture in a Postmodern world. 
</P>
<P>
 Moruzzi's calling is to proselytize why the geometric Mar Vista housing tract 
designed by Gregory Ain deserves as much attention as Victorian bungalows, why 
the Space Age excesses of Pann's coffee shop in Ladera Heights demands the same 
respect as Art Deco department stores. He delights in showing off a concrete 
doorway screen shaped like a snowflake at the original Directors' Guild 
building in Hollywood, built in 1954, or the large rubber tree in the glass 
lobby of the Fairfax district's Devonshire Motel, built in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is the mecca of Modernism. This is where the gods of Modernism were 
doing their work. So where else could I live?" asked Moruzzi, who is the 
volunteer chairman of the Los Angeles Conservancy's Modern Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 17, he and fellow devotees will get an unprecedented chance to preach 
to a large audience of the converted and the uninitiated. The conservancy, a 
nonprofit preservation organization, is sponsoring a driving and walking tour 
of 79 noteworthy houses, shops, hotels, theaters, restaurants, schools, office 
buildings and a gasoline station built between 1945 and 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Moruzzi and the other unpaid docents hope the sprawling tour will help save 
structures even if some styles give today's aesthetes the creeps, the blahs or 
the giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reminder of losses, the tour passes several sites of demolished Modern 
landmarks, such as the departed Googie's coffee shop, designed by John Lautner 
and built at Crescent Heights and Sunset boulevards in 1949; Googie's, with its 
flying red roof, lent its name to an exuberant architectural trend aimed at 
attracting passing motorists. An early McDonald's hamburger stand in Downey is 
too far off the main path for the tour, but its threatened demolition adds 
relevancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if people currently don't like these buildings that much, our goal is to 
just get them to actually look and understand how significant they were and why 
they were built the way they were," Moruzzi said during a dry run of the tour. 
Tastes, he confidently predicts, will come around. After all, now-beloved 
gingerbread Victorian houses were for many years considered "ugly and overdone 
and ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Moruzzi is an unusual candidate for his avocation. He is not an architect, not 
a critic, not an artist, but a self-taught enthusiast. Raised in Hawaii, he 
earned an economics degree at UC Berkeley and moved to Los Angeles five years 
ago in part, he says, because of its architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 His home is in Silver Lake, near houses designed by his heroes Ain, Lautner, 
Richard Neutra and R. M. Schindler; within an easy walk is the Astro, a 1958 
diner by the Googie firm of Armet and Davis. The apartment, built in the 1940s, 
is furnished with blond wood pieces of the era and two vintage TVs. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1961 Buick LeSabre convertible used to grace the driveway until, he 
confesses, maintenance got too expensive. So, at the wheel of his 1993 Honda, 
Moruzzi set out on the dry run, telling how the Modern principle of "less is 
more" blossomed in the California sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a prewar European revolt against ornamentation, Modernism was 
characterized by glass-enclosed houses with flat roofs and efficient, sleek 
office buildings with horizontal window bands. In the 1950s, a fascination with 
the future found expression in new construction techniques and marketing 
gimmicks. Using plastics and metal alloys, Space Age diners looked ready for 
takeoff and motels seemed ready for the Jetsons. Unlike Postmodernism, which 
echoes classical styles, Modernism allowed no looking back. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy tour begins at the Hollywood's Capitol Tower, the world's 
first round office building. It is, he said, "fabulous," although it really was 
not designed to look like a stack of records with a needle on top. (The 
architect who designed it in 1954, Welton Becket, contended that the round 
layout would promote efficiency.) Moruzzi cruised through Hollywood, 
Mid-Wilshire, Beverly Hills, Culver City, Mar Vista and Inglewood, with a break 
at the restored Ship's on Washington Boulevard for a dose of its neon jet trail 
sign and table-side toasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he pointed to less flashy buildings, like the two-story, red 
and green Palmdale House apartments in West Hollywood. Designed in 1951 by 
Sanford Kent, the building fronts the side street with a trellis swooping off 
its roof. "You can take something that's functional and make something 
sculptural," Moruzzi says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mishmash" is Moruzzi's ultimate put down and he uses it for the nearby Virgin 
Megastore on Sunset Strip. That new retail and movie complex qualifies as his 
creed's Great Satan because it is high Postmodern, combining ancient Roman 
patterns with colorful fun house doodads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's sort of a betrayal of the tenets of Modernism, which was, 'Form 
follows function,' " he said. "This is pretty much decoration. There's no 
integrity to it really and, I think, within just a few years, it will be dated. 
I don't think it will age well." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mar Vista, he argues for the Ain tract of boxy houses that might send 
Spanish revival fans fleeing. "It's a time warp, it's incredible," Moruzzi said 
cruising Beethoven, Moore and Meier streets. "It's everything you love about 
Modern -- the flat roofs, beautiful landscaping, clean lines, lots of glass. 
It's tasteful, it's elegant, it's consistent. It's not a mishmash."

ASSEMBLY OFFICER, 2ND MAN ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A sergeant-at-arms for the California Assembly is facing charges of possession 
of drugs for sale after allegedly being caught with cocaine and cash in a 
state-owned Cadillac, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Perry Thompson, a sergeant-at-arms assigned to the Assembly Rules 
Committee office in Los Angeles, was arrested Friday night in Encino along with 
a companion, Nicholas Robert Brown, who also faces drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to release any details or even give the ages of the suspects or 
Brown's occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said that more than 30 grams of cocaine and an undisclosed amount 
of cash were found in the late-model Cadillac when the car was pulled over by 
police after a tip from members of a citizens' patrol who were suspicious of 
the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's job as sergeant-at-arms includes chauffeuring Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown and other members of the Assembly when the politicians are in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sometimes drives for the Speaker," said Darolyn Davis, press secretary for 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cadillac and two Buicks are assigned to the Rules Committee office in Los 
Angeles for the use of members of the Assembly, according to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 sergeants-at-arms work for the Legislature, most of them in 
Sacramento, with only three stationed in the Los Angeles Assembly rules office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergeants-at-arms are sworn state peace officers and provide security for 
meetings and hearings of the Assembly. But the jobs are widely seen as 
political patronage positions, and the sergeants are sometimes considered 
gofers for members of the Assembly and are required to run routine errands for 
their politician bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson and Brown each paid a bail of $15,000 and are scheduled to appear in 
court May 4 to answer to the felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cadillac, which was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department, was 
released to a state police officer Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the West Valley Division made the arrest about 11 p.m. near 
Ventura Boulevard and Yarmouth Avenue after being radioed by members of a 
volunteer surveillance group, according to Steve Getzoff, founder of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 members of the group were working with police to help crack down on a 
string of auto burglaries along Ventura Boulevard, according to Getzoff. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the area where the arrests were 
made, called the incident ironic and depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 She said: "Here we have citizens that feel they have to work with the LAPD to 
make their neighborhoods safer, and here they are working with police who catch 
and arrest a state peace officer. It's disgusting." 
</P>

MORE THAN 50 ELECTIONS TO BE DECIDED TUESDAY; POLITICS: MAIN THEMES OF 
CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY ARE CRIME AND BUDGET CRISES. ROBERTI FACES 
RECALL VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Local elections across Los Angeles County on Tuesday have attracted scores of 
candidates, including 13 Long Beach hopefuls running for an office long on 
prestige but lacking in power. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Long Beach plays only a small role in crafting the city's budget, 
has no vote on the City Council and possesses limited veto authority. "In terms 
of formal powers, I know of no other major city in the country in which the 
mayor is weaker," said Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State 
Long Beach. "About all the mayor does is take charge of chairing the (council) 
meetings and seeing that the proper decorum is maintained." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the job pays more than $80,000 a year. And the reelection bid by 
65-year-old Ernie Kell, who has been mayor for six years, is viewed by many as 
a key contest in the city's history. While Kell touts his behind-the-scenes 
approach to issues, several of his challengers argue fresh blood is needed to 
help Long Beach cope with sweeping economic and social changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Tuesday, the one race attracting national interest takes place in 
the San Fernando Valley, where state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) faces a 
bitter recall election. Roberti has been targeted by a coalition of firearms 
advocates angered by legislation he authored that banned military-style assault 
weapons in California. Roberti has branded his foes single-issue gun fanatics, 
and the race will be watched as a gauge of the power of gun control opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall is, in part, a symbolic gesture because, even if the effort fails, 
Roberti will leave his Senate seat at year's end because of the state's new 
term-limits law. Roberti initially planned to retire from public life. But 
declaring that he would not be forced out of politics, he decided to run for 
state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Norwalk, meanwhile, a former city department head who was fired last year 
after being accused of sexual harassment is running for City Council. Carson 
voters will directly elect their mayor for the first time in an election marred 
by accusations of racism. And West Hollywood may see its first gay council 
majority in nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, more than 50 local elections are on tap Tuesday. In dozens of them, 
two themes predominate: crime and looming budget crises. From the posh 
boulevards of Beverly Hills to the ethnic enclaves of Rosemead, candidates are 
calling for more police and less government red tape. The "tough-on-crime, 
business-friendly" rhetoric comes at a time when cities, pinched by the state, 
are cutting budgets and looking for ways to attract investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Political clout is also an issue in many cities, with minorities hoping to 
gain more power at city halls. Monterey Park voters could make history by 
electing the first city council in California with an Asian American majority. 
And the San Marino, Arcadia and Rosemead city councils may get their first 
minority members -- each an Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolly Leong, a council candidate in Rosemead, said: "The Asian community is a 
third of this city, and it's about time we had a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos also stand to gain from the elections. South Gate, where 83% of 
residents are Latino, could get its first Latino council majority since its 
founding 71 years ago. The tiny city of San Fernando, with nearly an equal 
percentage of Latino residents, could gain its first all-Latino council. 
Challengers in two Long Beach City Council races also are making strong bids to 
become the first Latinos on the nine-member body. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most attention in Long Beach is focused on the mayor's race. Whoever 
wins it and occupies the mayor's 14th-floor office at City Hall will take the 
helm of a city in flux. Long Beach once was home to giant defense contractors, 
a thriving naval station and a population whose homogeneous roots gave rise to 
the city's nickname of "Iowa-by-the-sea." But military cutbacks have thrown the 
economy into a tailspin at a time when immigration has created growing Latino 
and Asian enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, much of the campaign rhetoric has concerned the need to create 
jobs, unite disparate neighborhoods and promote an international image for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Among incumbent Kell's well-financed foes -- those who have raised more than 
$100,000 -- are City Council members Ray Grabinski and Jeffrey A. Kellogg, 
former Long Beach City College President Beverly O'Neill, Redevelopment Board 
member Don Westerland and Belmont Shore businessman Frank Colonna. The eclectic 
field also includes an avowed Marxist, a Santa Claus look-alike and a 
20-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many candidates, no one is expected to win the primary by gaining more 
than 50% of the vote. If that does happen, the two top vote-getters will meet 
in a June 7 runoff. And with Kell coming under attack from virtually every 
challenger, his fate remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conventional wisdom is that Ernie Kell will be a shoo-in for one of those 
two top slots, but he certainly doesn't have a lock on it," said Jeff Adler, a 
veteran Long Beach political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look other notable elections on Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Norwalk, a former department head who was dismissed last year after being 
accused of sexual harassment is running for City Council. Jesse M. Luera, 
former director of the city's Social Services Center and currently president of 
the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified school board, has denied allegations that he 
sexually harassed two female employees who worked for him. Both women have 
lawsuits pending against Luera and the city. A third employee has filed a 
lawsuit alleging that Luera raped her when she worked in his department in 
1992, a claim Luera denies. No criminal charges have been filed. Luera was 
dismissed last year by City Manager Richard Powers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The mayor's race in Carson has been filled with accusations of racial 
politics, punctuated by a break-in at one of the candidate's campaign 
headquarters. Michael I. Mitoma, currently the city's appointed mayor, has 
accused the community's influential grass-roots organization United Voice of 
endorsing an all-black slate of candidates mainly because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnically mixed city was left with no black council members for the first 
time in its 25-year history when Juanita M. McDonald was elected to the state 
Assembly in 1992. United Voice and Mitoma's challenger, James Peoples, denied 
the group's endorsement was based on race. 
</P>
<P>
 Peoples also noted that Mitoma, a Japanese American, was endorsed by the 
Pilipino-American Alliance. Peoples charged that a recent burglary at his 
election offices was politically motivated. Mitoma said he knows "absolutely 
nothing about the break-in." 
</P>
<P>
 * West Hollywood, whose population is about one-third gay and lesbian, could 
get its first gay council majority since 1986 with a sweep of the three 
available seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent John Heilman, who is seeking reelection, currently is the only 
openly gay member on the five-member council. Nine of the 10 candidates are 
openly gay. But the one heterosexual in the race, incumbent Sal Guarriello, was 
the city's top vote-getter in the 1990 council races.

RACES SHOW PECULIAR SIDE OF POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Tuesday's municipal elections approach, just about every city has its big 
campaign issues. You have your crime, your gangs, your local landfill, your 
decimated municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Temple City, you have your bridal shops. 
</P>
<P>
 In this city of 31,000, the nine bridal shops have taken center stage in the 
City Council election, with one candidate calling for an investigation of the 
"plague of bridal shops." Some Asian Americans see that charge as thinly 
disguised racism because all the shops are owned by Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 That is only one of the election oddities that have surfaced recently in the 
San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A Monrovia mayoral candidate admits that she illegally spent $5,295 of her 
campaign money on four tailored suits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the El Monte Police Officers Assn. is under investigation for 
allegedly paying a transient to steal the campaign signs of candidates the 
union opposes. In Arcadia, the son of a councilman was investigated for 
allegedly removing the sign of one of his father's opponents. A volunteer for 
one Monterey Park City Council incumbent spent a night in jail on suspicion of 
defacing the campaign signs of another incumbent with swastikas. But he was 
released for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 And the consultant for a proposal to build a card club in Monterey Park -- a 
proposal that died largely because of the efforts of a Chinese American 
councilman -- is alleged to have sent out a flyer that the secretary of state's 
office says might illegally discourage Asian Americans from voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign is a mess," said Carolyn Besnyl, president of the League of 
Women Voters in the east San Gabriel Valley. "Some of the things that have been 
going on are really strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicos say elections in smaller cities provide fertile breeding ground for 
such capers because they receive less scrutiny than elections in cities the 
size of Los Angeles, where campaigns are more closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the horror stories come from local elections, in large part because a 
few voters can make a big difference so there's an incentive not to play by the 
rules," said Tony Miller, acting secretary of state who oversees the Fair 
Political Practices Commission. "A lot of things can go on that probably 
wouldn't withstand the light of day if it happened in bigger places." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has referred the Monterey Park flyer case to the Los Angeles County 
district attorney for investigation into possible violations of the state 
election code. About 13,000 residents received an official-looking but 
anonymous flyer printed in English and Chinese that warned of $10,000 fines and 
imprisonment for those who disobey voting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the flyers were traced to Steven G. Mott, a consultant for BCTC 
Development Corp., whose proposal to build a card club was thwarted last year, 
in large part because of opposition from Councilman Sam Kiang. Kiang believes 
the flyers were aimed at keeping his supporters from the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone calls to Mott were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Monte, George Hopkins, president of the police officers association and 
a training officer with the Police Department, denies that he paid a transient 
50 cents for each sign the man removed that bore the name of candidates opposed 
by the association. The group seeks to oust Mayor Patricia A. Wallach for her 
opposition to increasing the number of police patrols. The El Monte Police 
Department is investigating the claims against Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Monterey Park, Councilman Fred Balderrama hired a private investigator 
after more than 40 large campaign signs disappeared or were defaced with 
swastikas. At 2:30 a.m. Thursday, the investigator allegedly spotted a 
volunteer for City Councilwoman Marie Purvis crouching with a hammer and gloves 
in front of a Balderrama sign and made a citizen's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Alexander Dunetz Jr. of Monterey Park, spent a night in jail but 
was released after police decided they did not have enough evidence to charge 
him. Dunetz, who says he is innocent, maintains that he was jogging. Purvis 
said she barely knew Dunetz and has denied knowledge of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arcadia, Robert Fasching, son of Councilman George Fasching, was one of 
three young men investigated for removing a campaign sign belonging to 
challenger Sheng Chang, who has lost more than 300 signs and calls the incident 
"outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fasching admits he was driving the car when he says another boy 
uprooted a sign. Chang decided not to pursue the matter in court but says he 
will file charges if any more signs disappear. The police have closed their 
investigation without any arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The spotlight is also on Monrovia mayoral hopeful Valerie C. Johnson-Morton, 
who spent $5,295 in campaign funds on "wardrobe expenses" last month at a swank 
Pasadena designer clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson-Morton had listed campaign contributions of $16,868 as of March 31, 
all but $300 of it in loans from herself and her husband. She said she was 
unaware she had broken the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an intelligent woman. I should have read the rules," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Temple City, a sleepy, mainly white residential town with a 
Midwestern feel that has seen its Asian American population jump 313% in the 
last decade to make up 20% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Council hopeful Joe Walker, a crime analyst with the Sheriff's Department who 
has been endorsed by the school board and the teachers association, asserts 
that bridal shops may be fronts for illegal activities, despite police reports 
to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says they bring in little tax revenue because most of their business 
is rentals -- a charge that many shops deny. Walker says businesses avoid 
moving to Temple City because they think the city has become a hub for bridal 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joon Fong, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based Asian Pacific American 
Legal Center, does not buy that reasoning.  
</P>
<P>
 "The justification he gives against bridal shops makes little sense," Fong 
said. "We think this person is taking a position that is racially 
irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker denies that his reasoning is racially motivated and says his campaign 
includes Asian American supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Raphael Sonenshein, a professor of political science at Cal State Fullerton 
who wrote a book on Los Angeles politics, says it is not surprising to find 
such incidents in elections in small- to medium-sized cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not U.S. senators, these are not the most dynamic and thoughtful 
campaign organizations . . . a real political thug would probably look down on 
a lot of this, think it was really tacky."

EXCESSIVE FORCE CONTRIBUTED TO JAIL WARD DEATH, NURSES SAY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES AT COUNTY-USC MEDICAL CENTER PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE IN 
FATALITY, ACCORDING TO TWO WITNESSES. FBI AND LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES ARE 
INVESTIGATING. 
</P>

<P>
 Excessive force by sheriff's deputies probably contributed to a prisoner's 
death last month in the jail ward of County-USC Medical Center, two nurses who 
work in the facility charged Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (deputies) were responsible for his death," William Strachan, a nurse 
who was among witnesses to the incident, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they used excessive and unnecessary force, which caused his death," 
Johnnie Blue, the other nurse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is investigating to determine if the prisoner's civil rights may have 
been violated. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves John Bernard Wiley Jr., a 41-year-old former construction 
worker who died March 4 after being brought to the jail ward for booking in an 
assault case. He was to be treated there for a head wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's officials say Wiley became combative at the 
facility. He stopped breathing, according to the department's account, as 
deputies and one Los Angeles police officer attempted to restrain him. Deputies 
staff the jail ward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department is investigating the case, said Sgt. Ron Spear, a 
spokesman who declined further comment when contacted Saturday. The Los Angeles 
Police Department and the district attorney's office also have launched 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office has not released information on the 
cause of Wiley's death pending the results of toxicology and other tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The two nurses, who witnessed the confrontation between Wiley and the 
deputies, said the prisoner initially seemed cooperative. But one deputy 
taunted the suspect physically, Blue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pushing him, like bullies do to kids in school," Blue said of the 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to both nurses, another deputy shoved the prisoner off a gurney and 
onto the ward's floor, which he hit headfirst. The suspect's head struck the 
floor "like a melon," said Blue. 
</P>
<P>
 As fellow deputies strapped Wiley back onto the stretcher, the nurses said, 
one of the deputies wrapped an arm around the prisoner's neck to assist in 
restraining him. Another placed an orange prison smock over the prisoner's 
face, apparently to prevent him from spitting, the nurses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle ended after about 15 minutes, the nurses said, when Wiley went 
limp and was rushed into the emergency room, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over Wiley's death became public last month when five hospital 
workers, including the two nurses, wrote a letter to the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors, demanding an investigation into what they called a case 
of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department had arrested Wiley on suspicion of assaulting an officer 
during a scuffle that took place after police responded to a domestic violence 
call by his ex-wife at her Mar Vista home. 
</P>

ELECTIONS / 20TH STATE SENATE DISTRICT; RECALL BATTLE INTENSIFIES IN 11TH HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The recall election of state Sen. David Roberti continued to widen Saturday as 
vanloads of San Francisco activists joined local Roberti campaign workers amid 
reports that the National Rifle Assn., the senator's sworn enemy, was targeting 
thousands of local voters with an out-of-state phone-bank operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, voters go to the polls to decide Roberti's fate in the first recall 
election against a state official in 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot, which also features five candidates seeking to replace the 
incumbent Van Nuys Democrat if more than 50% of the 20th Senate District 
electorate votes to oust him, is being closely watched nationally as a 
referendum on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 With the election only three days away, the campaign tempo picked up Saturday 
as the candidates and their allies fanned out across the San Fernando Valley in 
search of voters and their support. 
</P>
<P>
 A big topic was the NRA's exact role. Ten days ago, an NRA spokesman confirmed 
that the organization would enter the race to defeat Roberti, who authored a 
1989 ban on assault rifles that has galled California and national gun 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of Friday, Stephen Helsley, an NRA executive in Sacramento, was still 
refusing to specify what steps the organization was taking against Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 However, attorney Kevin Washburn, spokesman for the pro-recall coalition, said 
it was his understanding that the NRA would be making tens of thousands of 
phone calls this weekend to identify anti-Roberti voters and then, in a second 
push, remind them on Monday and Tuesday to vote. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Roberti confirmed Saturday that his campaign workers were hearing about 
out-of-state phone calls being placed by the NRA. "It's the NRA's modus 
operandi to come in at the last minute," added Sandy Cooney, western regional 
director for Handgun Control Inc., the group run by celebrated gun control 
activist Sarah Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooney also reported Saturday that his own group, based in Washington, D.C., 
had helped Roberti pay for one-minute radio ads that began running Saturday on 
local stations. Meanwhile, Roberti also benefited Saturday from other imported 
help as three dozen Catholic church volunteers drove down from San Francisco to 
join his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Rathbone of St. Mary's Church in San Francisco said he and his group 
of seven volunteers wanted to ensure that progressive politicians like Roberti, 
who support rent control and gun control, stay in office. 
</P>
<P>
 At a midmorning pep rally in North Hollywood, Roberti told 80 precinct 
workers, including the fresh troops from the Bay Area, that the real issue in 
the recall is the public's right to control guns and the real political enemies 
are the gun extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're going to drive them out of the San Fernando Valley once and 
forever!" Roberti told his cheering supporters, many of them members of VOICE 
(Valley Organized in Community Efforts), an activist group of Valley-based 
church volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sick and tired of our kids being destroyed by guns," Celia Barragan, a 
leader of VOICE from Pacoima, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, recall drive leaders gathered at their own headquarters, where one of 
them claimed that even if the recall fails at the polls Tuesday, the movement 
has been victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already won," said Russ Howard, a South Bay financial consultant and 
leader of the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity. "We've effectively 
prevented David Roberti from going on in politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, who will be forced to leave the Senate in December anyway because of 
term limits, is running for the Democratic nomination for state treasurer 
against former Democratic Party head Phil Angelides. Roberti has been so badly 
crippled by the charges made by the recall movement against him that he will 
lose to Angelides, Howard predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall organizers have said that Roberti, as president pro tem of the Senate 
for 13 years, tolerated the political corruption that has scandalized the state 
capital in recent years and has been soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying Roberti knew exactly" about the corruption of many of his 
fellow senators, including Alan Robbins of Van Nuys, Howard said. "But it's 
hard to believe that he didn't know something stank up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has denied that he knew of or was involved in any of the corruption 
that has resulted in prison sentences for three former state senators. 
</P>
<P>
 At the pro-recall coalition headquarters in Van Nuys, half a dozen workers, 
including Paul Payne of Riverside and Easyriders magazine writer Jim Clark, 
were calling voters, asking them to recall Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne, who owns an auto shop, said he was seeking Roberti's ouster because the 
senator has opposed the death penalty. Payne said his father was killed in an 
armed robbery in Sacramento in 1991 yet his killer was able to avoid the 
electric chair. "Guys like Roberti let him go," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a Van Nuys resident in a Harley-Davidson sweat shirt, said he was 
recruited to work the phones by People's Advocate, a taxpayer group founded by 
Paul Gann. "Relatives and friends of mine died in World War II, Korea and 
Vietnam, and they didn't do so to keep the likes of Roberti in office," Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several miles away in Sherman Oaks, candidate Randy Linkmeyer, a gun store 
owner, was trying to persuade John Goddard, a local contractor, to vote for the 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Goddard, standing in the doorway of his Sherman Oaks home, was leery at first, 
but his attitude appeared to change when Linkmeyer told him of Roberti's 
support for ousted California Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird. "He called her a 
modern-day Joan of Arc," Linkmeyer said. "Oh, ge-e-e-z," said Goddard, turning 
away in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we turned him around," Linkmeyer later told a reporter as he and his 
entourage walked along Fulton Avenue. Among the Linkmeyer troop was the 
candidate's 5-year-old son, Danny, friends with their child and Helen Gabriel, 
who in years past was the GOP nominee in races against former state Assemblyman 
Tom Bane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here with Randy, because I think he's highly qualified," the veteran 
campaigner said of Linkmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, outside a Hughes Market in North Hills, candidate Al Dib, a retired 
green grocer, and his daughter, Vanessa Birkner, were having some luck with the 
voters they were hitting with campaign flyers. "I hadn't made up my mind, but 
now I have," said Virginia Meyer, a retired real estate broker. "I think it's 
good that he's out in a public place asking for support." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget to vote for me," Dib told one shopper as he stuffed a flyer in 
her grocery bag. 
</P>
<P>
 But the candidates also faced some rough spots, too, indicative of the 
passions aroused by the Roberti recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Composer Rand Bishop cursed Dib at the Hughes Market, saying he had just that 
morning seen Dib's TV commercial that criticizes Roberti for being soft on 
crime. "I saw your ad and it was disgusting," Bishop told an astonished Dib. 
"Well, at least they're seeing them," Dib said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, an unidentified man in a Jeep rolled down his window and hurled 
expletives at Roberti as the senator stood in the parking lot outside his 
campaign headquarters talking to supporters. "What was the license plate on 
that car?" a security man from the Roberti camp later asked reporters.

POVERTY, PRIDE -- AND POWER; IN LINE FOR FEDERAL HELP, PACOIMA HIDES PROBLEMS 
BELOW NEAT SURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The poorest community in the San Fernando Valley, and one of the worst off 
citywide, nevertheless hides its poverty well. 
</P>
<P>
 Few homeless people walk Pacoima's streets. Its major shopping center has no 
vacancies. And, for the most part, the houses are neat, their yards 
well-tended. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pacoima also is a place where the poverty rate hovers between 25% and 40%, 
where one of three people lives in public housing and where holding a job is no 
guarantee against being poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Those bleak statistics have led area Councilman Richard Alarcon and Pacoima's 
congressional representative, Howard Berman, to push for a two-square-mile 
section in the heart of Pacoima to be included in the city's bid for a federal 
empowerment zone, the centerpiece of President Clinton's urban revitalization 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation would allow the area to share in tax breaks for businesses and 
up to $100 million in government funds for social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city will not formally decide which communities to include in its 
application until June, the proposed Pacoima area is virtually assured a spot 
on Los Angeles' wish list. Likewise, the city is considered a shoo-in to be one 
of six urban areas nationwide selected by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on everything that's happened in Los Angeles over the last few years, I 
would be stunned" if the city was not picked, said Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed zone is home to about 13,000 people, who live in a section of 
central Pacoima and a southern sliver of Lake View Terrace. The area lies 
between Van Nuys Boulevard and Hansen Dam, the Foothill Freeway and San 
Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
 It includes the site where Rodney King was pulled over and beaten by police, 
an incident that led to the Los Angeles riots, and in turn to a national focus 
on depressed urban locales, and finally to the empowerment zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very neglected area, one that needs a lot of attention," Alarcon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides wanting a concessions business at Hansen Dam, Alarcon said he has no 
specific plans for the area if it wins empowerment zone status. He merely hopes 
the zone would attract commercial and industrial firms and, with them, 
well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the political attention is coming none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community has been ignored for too long," said longtime resident Anthony 
Johnson, 68, who lives in a trailer parked off Van Nuys Boulevard, between the 
two sprawling public housing complexes that dominate the proposed zone. "Crime 
is bad, people's job status is worse than it's ever been. . . . We sure need 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The last few years have been especially trying for the blue-collar town, which 
is dependent on employment at nearby factories. Pacoima was left reeling by 
deep cuts at Lockheed, which has dropped more than 8,000 jobs at its Burbank 
plant since 1990, and the loss of 2,600 more jobs when General Motors closed 
its Van Nuys plant in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, those relatively high-paying jobs had provided families with a 
springboard out of the San Fernando Gardens and Van Nuys Pierce Park Apartments 
public housing complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 After the layoffs, many longtime residents simply left. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people have lost jobs, they started selling their homes and moving 
out," said Oscar Williams, owner of Big "O" Realty, which has been located in 
Pacoima for 16 years. "They had to follow their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 One who has stayed is W.C. Williams, a 26-year resident who now lives at the 
Pledgerville Senior Citizens Villa on Van Nuys Boulevard. On a recent spring 
day, Williams, 68, relaxed on his three-wheeled bicycle, taking in the sun and 
exchanging waves and hellos with friends driving by the center. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, he said, the bad old days are over, especially with regard to 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the old people used to get robbed in here," he said of the senior 
center that has since been equipped with a security gate. "The dope fiends used 
to run in through here with cops chasing them. It was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he suffered a stroke a few years ago, Smoky, as friends call him, has 
ridden his three-wheeler daily for exercise. Williams says he rides without 
fear, even though in 1993, 10 people were slain within five blocks of the 
senior center, including one of Williams' longtime friends, Olivia Divers -- a 
homeless woman who was gunned down in a drive-by. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that although crime in Pacoima remains a major problem, 
particularly in the area encompassing the empowerment zone, the situation is 
far improved from the 1980s, when a dead-end street in San Fernando Gardens was 
nicknamed "Sherm Alley." There, drug dealers traded in a popular brand of 
cigarette -- Shermans -- dipped in the hallucinogen PCP.  
</P>
<P>
 But that crime surge was met by an unprecedented wave of activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, led by churches, social service agencies and schools, began working 
on several fronts: They held rallies and marches; schools were opened on 
weekends and in the evenings to offer expanded recreation and tutoring 
programs; petitions were circulated to keep out liquor stores, and most 
significantly, residents began holding weekly meetings with a gang that had 
long been a neighborhood scourge. 
</P>
<P>
 The activism appears to have paid off. In addition to reducing major crime in 
the area by 6%, residents reached an accord with liquor outlet owners, who 
agreed to erase graffiti on their storefronts within 24 hours and to discourage 
public drinking by selling no cold individual beers. Additionally, meetings 
with Latino gang members have led to 143 consecutive days without a drive-by 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to choose the major reason why crime is down, it would have to be 
the community involvement," said Officer Minor Jimenez, senior lead officer in 
Pacoima for the past 3 1/2 years. "More people are cooperating with the police 
and the bad guys know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Berman says that activism, joined with a true need, forms the perfect 
setting for one of the new federal zones. "Pacoima is an example of why there 
is every reason for the creation of empowerment zones," Berman said. "It has 
high unemployment, serious social problems, (but) a community leadership that 
wants to turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The poverty rate in the proposed zone is twice that of the rest of the city. 
And even though indications of entrenched poverty are not obvious, hints are 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pacoima Elementary School, more than half the students eat federally 
subsidized lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there are few boarded-up storefronts along the Van Nuys Boulevard 
commercial strip, many of the spaces are filled with pawnshops, storefront 
churches and auto repair shops. Check-cashing outlets abound, but the nearest 
bank is several blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 The public housing complexes are relatively free of graffiti, but are home to 
nearly a third of the neighborhood's residents. Families on waiting lists for 
the complexes live out of sight, crowded in garages and converted tool sheds, 
often without electricity, heat or running water. 
</P>
<P>
 That the area is free of the overt blight found in other low-income 
neighborhoods is no accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very poor community, but there's a tremendous amount of pride here," 
said Cecilia Costas, principal of Maclay Junior High School. "You can be poor, 
but that doesn't mean you have to grovel or look like you are poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Alvarez, who grew up at San Fernando Gardens and now manages Pierce Park 
-- a federally subsidized but privately owned complex -- also emphasizes the 
positive. "The important thing is to have a positive living environment no 
matter where you live." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Alvarez has expanded youth recreation programs, admonishes 
tenants not to refer to their home as "the projects" and also has tried to 
soften Pierce Park's look. "We have a small fence because we don't want to 
encase the area with wrought iron and concrete," she said. "And we plant lots 
of flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Leticia Fuentes, a 32-year-old single mother of four, sat and watched 
her children play. Nearby, a group of young men stood smoking cigarettes and 
drinking bottles of beer. Every few minutes, a police car passed, the officer 
and the group of men exchanging long stares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an easy life, but with a little luck, maybe we can get enough money 
to buy a house," Fuentes said, pulling out two old Lottery tickets, neither a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 An immigrant from Mexico two years ago, Fuentes said she can't work because 
she has no green card or anyone to care for her children. She lives at Pierce 
Park in a two-bedroom apartment, with her aunt and her aunt's two children, 
whom Fuentes also watches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a bad place to live here, but it's too small," she remarked. 
</P>
<P>
 According to census data, most of the residents of the two tracts that make up 
the proposed empowerment zone live in crowded homes and nearly 40% are under 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate was nearly 14% at the time of the 1990 U.S. census, 
compared to 8.4% citywide, and even many of those who work bring home less than 
$14,000 -- the official poverty rate for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, more than 40% of the residents were born outside the United States, 
and nearly two of three people speak Spanish at home, a fact borne out at 
Pacoima Elementary, where three-quarters of the school's students speak only 
limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacoima has traditionally been a first stop for immigrants to Southern 
California escaping rural poverty. First, it was African Americans fleeing 
segregation in the South after World War II, who settled there because of 
racially discriminatory covenants elsewhere in the city. Eventually, the area 
became the center of African-American life in the Valley and, by 1960, nearly 
all of the Valley's 10,000 African Americans lived in Pacoima and nearby 
Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1960s, the area began to be transformed again as immigrants -- 
this time from rural Mexico -- came to Pacoima, drawn by its low housing costs 
and proximity to manufacturing jobs. As the African Americans who could afford 
to moved out, they were replaced by a growing population of even poorer people. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of African Americans in Pacoima's population went from 75% in 
the 1970s to 10% in 1990. Meanwhile, the Latino population rose to 71% in 1990, 
as Mexican immigrants were joined by Salvadorans and Guatemalans. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Pacoima's Latinos and African Americans have not always gotten along, 
the mood has shifted from conflict to conciliation as the town has become 
increasingly Latino. An African-American hairstylist specializing in black 
women's hair now advertises in Spanish. Several African-American churches have 
added Spanish-language services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need each other right now," said Williams, the real estate broker. But 
the bottom line, he added, is that Pacoima "is 
</P>
<P>
 a transitory place where people have tended to stay only until they can afford 
to move someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the empowerment zone say its creation would help buck that trend 
by attracting new businesses -- and jobs -- to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the guidelines, if Pacoima receives empowerment zone status, businesses 
inside the zone would receive tax incentives, including payroll tax deductions 
of as much as 20% of the wages paid to workers living in the zone. 
Additionally, businesses would get significant tax breaks for buying new 
equipment and machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Pacoima zone could share in $100 million set aside for programs 
ranging from substance abuse to child care to job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighborhood in Pacoima, this one south of the Golden State Freeway, 
has been part of a similar city enterprise zone since the late 1980s, but has 
had only limited success in luring new businesses. The problem, critics say, is 
that for the most part, only existing businesses benefit from any of the 
government-sanctioned zones -- and people who want to open up new places are 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Carlos Orrelas. At 58, Orrelas is the would-be owner of Esquina Market -- 
the full-service grocery store he wants to start inside the proposed federal 
zone. But Orrelas is about $8,000 short. While he tries to save, he sells 
fruits and vegetables out of boxes inside an otherwise empty store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need a tax break. We need a loan," said his son, Gerardo Orrelas, 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lake View Terrace Village, a shopping center just south of the 
Foothill Freeway on Foothill Boulevard, is the kind of place the zone might 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 When the center's major draw and anchor for more than 16 years, Phil's Food 
Queen Court supermarket, closed last October, fewer people came to use the 
center's other stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline can be traced through notes left on store windows. "Dear 
Customers, we are closed. Please come and pick up your clothes. . . . We are 
not responsible after 15 days," reads one at Janek's Cleaners and Laundrys, 
where all that's left inside are racks of laundered white shirts. A similar 
message greets visitors to a now-closed soul food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynoso's Donut shop has survived, but a note might appear on its window any 
day now. Before the supermarket closed, the bakery sold $160 to $170 a day in 
doughnuts. Now, the shop is lucky to sell $40. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only ones making money are the liquor stores," said store clerk Tony 
Santiago, 14, nodding to a bustling liquor store at one end of the shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, life goes on in Pacoima. Gang members and ex-gangsters meet the 
rest of the community each Wednesday night to hash out their differences. 
Residents at Pierce Park are collecting $600 for a Mother's Day mariachi 
concert to honor the complex's moms. And with a little luck, tomorrow might be 
the 144th consecutive day without a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Though hope is eternal, there is also the recognition that residents can't do 
it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing is that there are no jobs here," said Veronica Rodriguez, 
director of the Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center. "That's what's keeping 
them in the streets: They have no jobs. We need (help) before we become another 
South-Central."

NEW YEAR'S FESTIVAL KEEPS TRADITIONS ALIVE; OBSERVANCE: THE CAMBODIAN COMMUNITY 
MIXES RELIGION, CUSTOMS AND ENTERTAINMENT TO USHER IN THE YEAR OF THE DOG, 
WHICH BEGINS WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 500 people celebrated their hope for the Cambodian new year on Saturday 
with a daylong festival of prayers, food and dancing at The Cambodian Family 
center here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to get together," said Kieng Lim of Garden Grove, who brought 
her 3-year-old nephew to celebrate the Year of the Dog. "We ask for luck, 
spirit and longevity for the New Year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cambodian New Year observance, which actually begins Wednesday and lasts 
three days, is a reverential time in which offerings of rice are placed in 
incense-filled bowls as sustenance for dead ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities also are marked by games for children and teen-agers. 
According to a Cambodian tradition that has been lost over the years in the 
United States, the three days of New Year are the only time young boys and 
girls can play together, rather than being divided rigidly by sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in Cambodia, people stay home for the three days of New Year, relaxing 
and playing. Cooking, cleaning and working are avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Cambodian refugees from across Southern California gathered in 
Santa Ana to celebrate and pass along some of the traditions to their children. 
Older Cambodians sat in circles on the floor of a performance space, which was 
pressed into service as a Buddhist temple. The barefoot men and women, burning 
candles and pungent incense at the feet of several monks in orange robes, 
prayed for their family members, both living and dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room. Cambodian youngsters competed for prizes at American-style 
game booths and amused themselves playing POGs, the decorated cardboard circles 
that have become popular with local children. 
</P>
<P>
 "New Year is a very big event for us," said 16-year-old Narin Keo, as he hung 
out with a group of teen-agers who considered themselves too old for the games 
but also too unfamiliar with many of their parents' Buddhist customs to join 
the religious ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Keo, whose family came for the second year from Long Beach to participate, 
added: "We hope the New Year will bring good and will enrich the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's celebration was pushed inside when early morning rain pounded the 
pavement. The rain soaked dozens of families as they slowly made their way to 
the festival on foot, across railroad tracks and along a rain gutter, from 
their apartments in the Minnie Street neighborhood, home to many Cambodian 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Each family brought rice for the ancestor offering in the traditional chan 
sruck -- three engraved silver bowls stacked together and topped by a handle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, 13 children in the Cambodian Family's youth program 
entertained the audience with traditional Cambodian folk dances that are 
performed throughout the year in Cambodia, not just at New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that through the dancing, they can identify themselves," said Chea 
Lim, the youth coordinator for the Cambodian Family, a nonprofit organization 
that helps refugees from war-torn countries adjust to life in the United 
States. "They don't know if they're Cambodian or American. We're hoping that 
here they can feel something that is Cambodian."

TINY WOMAN STOPS 300-POUND CARJACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 4-foot-11, Maria Valdoria may be small, but her grip was too much Saturday 
for the 300-pound man who tried to steal her car in Whittier, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdoria, 23, of La Mirada, was driving out of a carwash shortly before noon 
when the man approached and told her the car was leaking oil, said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Angie McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 When Valdoria got out to check her car, the man allegedly jumped in and began 
to drive away. But Valdoria leaped into the car on top of the man and held fast 
to the steering wheel, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Honda Accord careened along busy Telegraph Road as the two struggled 
at the wheel. McLaughlin said off-duty sheriff's Deputy Larry Thompson, stopped 
at a light, noticed the vehicle and gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 From his car, McLaughlin said, the deputy could heard Valdoria screaming for 
the man to stop as she was hanging out of the car, swinging.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect stopped the vehicle about two blocks later and Valdoria grabbed 
the keys and turned off the ignition, McLaughlin said. She said Thompson 
arrived and held the man at gunpoint until other officers came on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, identified as Carlos Garcia, 39, of Corona, was booked on 
suspicion of kidnaping and carjacking. He was being held at the Norwalk 
sheriff's station late Saturday on $100,000 bail, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdoria was not injured.

ASSEMBLY OFFICER, 2ND MAN FACE DRUG CHARGES; CRIME: THE TWO ARE ARRESTED IN 
ENCINO AFTER CASH AND COCAINE ARE ALLEGEDLY FOUND IN STATE-OWNED VEHICLE. 
</P>

<P>
 A sergeant-at-arms for the California Assembly is facing charges of possession 
of drugs for sale after allegedly being caught with cocaine and cash in a 
state-owned Cadillac, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Perry Thompson, a sergeant-at-arms assigned to the Assembly Rules 
Committee office in Los Angeles, was arrested Friday night in Encino along with 
a companion, Nicholas Robert Brown, who also faces drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to release any details or even give the ages of the suspects or 
Brown's occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said that more than 30 grams of cocaine and an undisclosed amount 
of cash were found in the late-model Cadillac when the car was pulled over by 
police after a tip from members of a citizens' patrol who were suspicious of 
the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's job as sergeant-at-arms includes chauffeuring Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown and other members of the Assembly when the politicians are in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sometimes drives for the Speaker," said Darolyn Davis, press secretary for 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cadillac and two Buicks are assigned to the Rules Committee office in Los 
Angeles for the use of members of the Assembly, according to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 sergeants-at-arms work for the Legislature, most of them in 
Sacramento, with only three stationed in the Los Angeles Assembly rules office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergeants-at-arms are sworn state peace officers and provide security for 
meetings and hearings of the Assembly. But the jobs are widely seen as 
political patronage positions, and the sergeants are sometimes considered 
gofers for members of the Assembly and are required to run routine errands for 
their politician bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson and Nicholas Brown each paid a bail of $15,000 and are scheduled to 
appear in court May 4 to answer to the felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cadillac, which was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department, was 
released to a state police officer Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the West Valley Division made the arrest about 11 p.m. near 
Ventura Boulevard and Yarmouth Avenue after being radioed by members of a 
volunteer surveillance group, according to Steve Getzoff, founder of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 members of the group were working with police to help crack down on a 
string of auto burglaries along Ventura Boulevard, according to Getzoff. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the area where the arrests were 
made, called the incident ironic and depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 She said: "Here we have citizens that feel they have to work with the LAPD to 
make their neighborhoods safer, and here they are working with police who catch 
and arrest a state peace officer. It's disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jim Newton and Carl Ingram contributed to this story.

ELECTIONS / BURBANK SCHOOL BOND; SIDES PAINT 2 VASTLY DIFFERENT PICTURES OF 
$100-MILLION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on who holds the brush, the $100-million bond facing voters is 
either the only hope for renovating and repairing Burbank's deteriorating 
schools -- or an inaccurate, wildly optimistic plan that could leech the 
pockets of already overtaxed residents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, voters will decide which portrait they accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole issue is, as a community do we want to take responsibility for 
rebuilding our school system?" said school board member Denise Wilcox. "Do the 
children of this community merit that kind of effort?  
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank as a community has always placed schools as an important part of the 
infrastructure of our city." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the bond will be used to modernize, renovate and rebuild the 
district's schools. Burbank High School would be completely rebuilt, Burroughs 
High School would be expanded and renovated, and all other schools would be 
renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond supporters say the measure would mean slightly higher property taxes -- 
an average of $33.63 a year, or "the cost of one fast-food meal per month." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents have accused bond promoters of misleading the public. "It is my 
opinion that the cost will be many more times what they're telling us, and 
that's what concerns me," said Joel Schlossman, a Burbank resident who once ran 
unsuccessfully for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking the easy way out and asking us to dig in our pockets and sign 
a blank check." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last election for both the school board and City Council, Burbank's 
aging and increasingly inadequate schools were a frequent topic of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "All one has to do is tour any school in the Burbank Unified School District" 
to realize the extent of the problems, said District Supt. Arthur Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we are talking about buildings which are 40 to 70 years old -- most 
of which have never had major renovation." 
</P>
<P>
 The schools bear deep scars of age: leaking roofs, falling tiles, poor 
lighting, sewage backup, brown water. Many classrooms have no air-conditioning 
and sometimes become so hot that computers shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "One has to say if a computer is too hot to operate, what about a human being, 
a student or teacher who is in that classroom which is 90 degrees, 100 degrees 
or higher?" Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the schools are not expanded, the district may be forced to adopt a 
year-round session to deal with overcrowding, district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the school board determined that the renovations and rebuilding 
would cost $138 million and devised a plan in joint meetings with members of 
the board and the City Council. The plan calls for schools to receive $23 
million from the City Redevelopment Agency, about $15 million from the state 
and the bulk of funds from the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burbank Board of Education has been able to structure a very unique 
financing package that will enable us to completely rehabilitate and modernize 
every school in our district," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each property owner's yearly cost would be based on the assessed value of the 
property as determined by the county tax assessor. In Burbank the median 
assessed value for houses is $101,000. The school board's financial 
consultants, Stone & Youngberg, projected that the bond would cost the typical 
homeowner in Burbank about $33.63 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who oppose the bond question both the board's figures and the manner in 
which school officials have presented the bond to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "This $33 is very deceptive," Schlossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlossman argued that the figure is significantly lower than one previously 
determined by another consulting firm and city staff. That firm, Praeger, 
McCarthy & Sealy, projected that a $100-million bond would cost the typical 
homeowner $112 per year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the impact of interest rates on the yearly cost per homeowner has not 
been fully explained to the voters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep in mind that the majority of these bonds will be issued in 
two years," he said. "We cannot predict what interest rates are going to be. We 
know that since this stuff was printed interest rates have gone up." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlossman concluded that the district arrived at the $33.63 figure by using 
best-case scenarios of projected assessed value and interest rates, both of 
which have been changing in ways that could make costs per property owner much 
higher, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce acknowledged that the first consultant and city staff projected that 
the average cost per homeowner would be higher than the district's figure of 
$33.63. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they were different proposals for different purposes and have no 
relationship to one another," Pierce said. Unlike the current plan, the first 
estimate was based on the idea of selling the bonds all at once, which explains 
the higher costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also question the growth rate used by district consultants in 
calculating the projected cost of the bond per homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though "two previous experts -- two from the city and Praeger -- 
projected that assessed value would grow at a much lower rate," the district's 
consultant uses a rate of 8.75%, said resident Ted McConkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dishonest," McConkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cost for each property owner "goes up if the growth rate is not as 
high as they say it is," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In its ballot statement about the bond, the Los Angeles County 
auditor/controller's office projects a growth rate of 5%. That figure, however, 
is "a generic formula" for Los Angeles County that does not consider factors 
specific to Burbank, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a 14% growth rate in Burbank over the last 25 years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several long-term factors unique to Burbank -- the increase in 
tax base that will result over the next few decades once the now vacant 
Lockheed property is developed, and the selling of pre-Proposition 13 homes, 
which significantly increase in assessed valuation when sold -- justify the use 
of a growth rate of between 8% and 9%, Pierce argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a conservative estimate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler McCauley, assistant auditor controller said the county tries "to use 
what we consider the most reasonable figure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our figure is based on the past three years and then a general estimate of 
where we think generally growth will go. . . . Both parties, us and them, are 
trying to predict growth over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Admittedly it's trying to guess the future. A lot of things change." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past the need to improve the schools rarely surfaced as an issue of 
debate, but in the remaining few days before the election, some opponents 
question the district's characterization of its campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're portraying this dismal picture of students not getting an education, 
students not having classrooms and students in classrooms that are falling 
down," said Elizabeth Michael who opposes the bond. "I think that's alarmist. I 
don't think the situation is anywhere near that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems at the schools are "not so urgent that they could not wait until 
we are in a better economic position to handle a rise in taxes like this," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say the picture is in fact dismal and will grow even more 
critical the longer the city waits. "They know that the need is 
unquestionable," Wilcox said. "What they're trying to do is create this aura of 
confusion among the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the election may stem in part from residents' view of the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are bad times," McConkey said. "When people get anxious about the 
future, they are not likely to buy new cars and increase their taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say they expect the economic future to be much brighter and they 
want to ensure the same for Burbank students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank has been through some of the worst of the recession already," Wilcox 
said. "Burbank city officials believe we have no place to go but up. They're 
very confident of that." Bond Facts 
</P>
<P>
 If the Burbank school bond passes, low-income elderly and disabled property 
owners will not be affected, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the Burbank City Council approved a subsidy plan that will 
reimburse low-income elderly and disabled property owners for the cost of the 
bond, which will be added to property tax bills. To be included in the subsidy 
plan, residents must be 62 or older, disabled, with a yearly household income 
of less than $16,900 or 19,300 for two people. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, characterized by council members as a means of assisting low-income 
residents, has been criticized by some residents as "vote buying." 
</P>
<P>
 Other features of the bond: 
</P>
<P>
 * Approximately 60% of the bond will be paid by commercial property and 40% 
residential, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bond is supported by the Burbank Teachers Assn., Parent Teacher Assn., 
Burbank Chamber of Commerce and many other local groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bond is opposed by Taxpayers Against Corruption and Double Taxation, Dr. 
Michael Stavropoulos and other residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bond requires a two-thirds vote to pass.

PENDLETON TO HOLD SHELLING EXERCISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People living within 50 miles of Camp Pendleton should expect to hear sporadic 
explosions throughout the day on Monday because of shelling exercises at the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosions will be the result of 95-pound projectiles fired from 155mm 
howitzers in the middle of the base. Five surrounding communities -- San 
Clemente, Temecula, Fallbrook, Vista and Oceanside -- will probably feel 
rumblings in addition to hearing the explosions, which will last until 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelling is part of monthly training.

TEACHER WILL REMAIN HOSPITALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high school English teacher who became ill after drinking a soda laced with 
cleaning fluid will remain in a Palmdale hospital for another night, hospital 
officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Ennis felt a burning sensation in her throat and then vomited during 
class Thursday morning at Littlerock High School after she drank from a can of 
soda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis told doctors that she feared someone poured dry-erase board cleaner into 
her drink because she had a bottle of the cleaner near her opened drink, said 
Cindy Reid, a spokeswoman for Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. Sheriff's 
reports noted that the can smelled of cleaning fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said doctors were keeping the 32-year-old teacher to run further 
gastrointestinal tests, including checks to determine whether Ennis has 
suffered kidney damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said there was no information about any suspects in the case. 
Officials at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station told reporters on Friday 
that they believed the incident to be a misguided prank and not a murder 
attempt.

PLAN TO HIKE BUS FARES AND REDUCE SERVICE PROTESTED; TRANSPORTATION: SMALL BUT 
VOCAL CROWD AT MTA MEETING IN PACOIMA ARGUES THAT LOW-INCOME RIDERS WOULD BE 
HURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposed fare increases and reductions in bus service introduced at a 
community transportation meeting drew sharp objections from a small but 
emotional crowd at the Boys & Girls Club in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only a handful of residents showed up for the meeting, sponsored by 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, they responded strongly to the 
possible increase in fares from $1.10 to $1.50, the scaling back of weekend and 
holiday service, and the cutting of bus lines that run parallel to rail routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about people who are on GR (general relief) who can barely afford the 
$1.10 now?" asked Garry Alourdas, a San Fernando resident who said he rides the 
bus at least twice a day to his job in Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not taking into consideration the people who can't afford the bus 
now. Pretty soon, it will be cheaper to buy a car than ride a bus," Alourdas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of Alice Parra's 300 employees at Precision Dynamics Corp., a 
manufacturing company in San Fernando, use the bus as their only form of 
transportation and would be greatly affected, Parra said.  
</P>
<P>
 "At $4.25 a hour, they can't afford increases," she told the MTA staff. "I am 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the MTA, which has a combined operating and capital deficit of 
$300 million, was forced to consider the cost-cutting measures to balance its 
budget by fiscal year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one at the MTA or any public transportation provider in the country likes 
telling their customers that their fares might go up," said Mark R. Dierking of 
the MTA. "But we are here today to tell you the truth as we see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dierking said the changes, which would be effective July 1, would be the first 
fare increases since 1988, when a basic fare was raised from 85 cents to $1.10. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the MTA will consider raising the price of monthly bus passes or 
discontinuing all but senior and disabled passes. Also proposed is the 
cancellation of late-night service, special-event service and bus lines with 
low ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposals will be held by the MTA at 10 a.m. April 23 
in the Los Angeles County Hall of Administration, 500 W. Temple St., Board of 
Supervisors hearing room, in Los Angeles.

ELECTIONS / LANCASTER CITY COUNCIL; PET-STORE VOTE DOGS INCUMBENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three incumbent City Council members, facing 10 challengers in Tuesday's 
election, have been forced time and again while campaigning to defend their 
decision to lure a large pet-supply store to town. 
</P>
<P>
 At political forums and in interviews with the candidates, the fur has flown 
most often over the council's vote last year to spend up to $187,500 in 
redevelopment funds over 7 1/2 years to persuade PetSmart to open in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the candidates hoping to unseat incumbents Arnie Rodio, George Root 
and the Rev. Henry Hearns, have asserted that the city should not subsidize 
larger retailers. They have said the council should be more sensitive to the 
concerns of Lancaster's small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal outraged the smaller pet-shop owners in town, who said PetSmart, with 
the city's support and discount prices, would steal their customers and 
jeopardize their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some 11th-hour campaign charges developed, the campaign has been 
otherwise low-key. The incumbents have stood by their decision, saying the city 
needs PetSmart's sales tax revenue to support critical services such as law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 They insist that the store will generate far more than the subsidy in sales 
tax revenue. Without the subsidy, they say PetSmart might have opened in 
Palmdale instead. 
</P>
<P>
 And they believe the challengers are hammering at the PetSmart deal because of 
the absence of more serious issues that have angered residents in the past -- 
such as growth limits, traffic problems and flooding hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our records stand on their own," said Root, who is seeking his second 
four-year term. "They don't have any issues on their own, so all they do is 
attack things that we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodio, who spearheaded a drive to incorporate Lancaster in 1977 and now is 
seeking a third term on the council, has no regrets about the PetSmart deal. "I 
did what was right for the city of Lancaster, protecting the taxpayers' base," 
he said 
</P>
<P>
 Hearns, who is seeking a second term, also stands by the vote. But he says the 
incumbents did not fully consider the impact on other pet stores. "I think we 
could have looked at it a lot more, maybe talked to the existing (store) owners 
some more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three incumbents each plan to spend more than $20,000 on their reelection 
campaigns, far more than any of the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some local activists believe the incumbents are vulnerable. They 
say the PetSmart deal showed they are out of touch with the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not PetSmart per se," said Milton Huckaby, secretary of the Lancaster 
Coalition of Neighborhood Organizations. "It's the thought behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, representing 23 homeowner associations and about 3,000 
households, has endorsed three challengers: Deborah Shelton, Michael Singer and 
Ronald Thomason. Four years ago, the group backed Hearns and Root, who were 
elected; two years ago, it supported Shelton and Singer, who finished third and 
fourth in a race for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the PetSmart issue, Singer has stirred attention by calling for 
unification of Palmdale and Lancaster. He believes the rival cities could 
operate more efficiently as a single entity. It would also eliminate the costly 
competition for new businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates have promised to increase spending on law enforcement, 
although the incumbents have pointed out that crime in Lancaster, a city of 
almost 110,000, is decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department figures, the number of 
major crimes in Lancaster dropped 7% between 1992 and 1993, and the crime rate 
-- the number of incidents per 10,000 residents -- dropped about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents also have taken credit for projects such as a new sheriff's 
station and new library, both slated for construction soon on Lancaster 
Boulevard. And they point with pride to the recent opening of the new Avenue L 
overpass at Sierra Highway.  
</P>
<P>
 Unseating the current council members will be tough, but not impossible, 
Huckaby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all agree it's hard to beat an incumbent," he said. "In less than a week, 
the general public will tell us whether we're right or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boils down to the public. If they're satisfied with the way things are 
going, they should vote for the incumbents. If they're not satisfied, they 
should vote for someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Running for the three seats on the Lancaster City Council are: 
</P>
<P>
 * ALBERT E. BLIGHT, 60, a retired aircraft inspector who has lived in 
Lancaster for 37 years. He has never run for office before and plans to spend 
less than $400 on his campaign, all his own money. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the city should stop giving incentives to retailers such as 
PetSmart and strive to bring more industrial employers to Lancaster. He also 
opposes the city's purchase of mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * IRENE M. FLORES, 36, a former small-business owner who has lived in 
Lancaster for six years. She plans to spend about $5,000 in personal funds and 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 She has never run for office before but entered the Lancaster race because of 
her concerns about crime in the Antelope Valley. She believes the city should 
encourage more community involvement to reduce crime. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * The REV. HENRY "HANK" HEARNS, 60, a civil engineer who retired in 1989 as

at First Missionary Baptist Church in Sun Village for 29 years and is a 
seven-year resident of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 He is active in many social service groups and views himself as a peacemaker 
on the council. He plans to spend about $22,000, mostly in donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * RONALD L. MAIN, 26, owner of a small gardening business and a five-year 
resident of Lancaster. He has never run for public office, but entered the race 
because he is upset that the city allowed a manufacturing firm to operate near 
the mobile home park where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He favors the elimination of federally subsidized housing in Lancaster. He 
plans to spend less than $1,000 on his campaign. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * DEBORAH SHELTON, 37, a four-year resident who works for the Lancaster United 
Methodist Church, running an after-school help line for latch-key children. She

 * MICHAEL J. SINGER, 41, a county paramedic-fire captain and lifelong

ELECTIONS / LANCASTER CITY COUNCIL; 3 ACCUSED OF UNFAIR USE OF MAILING LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 11th-hour election maneuverings, a Lancaster voter has complained to the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission that three City Council incumbents 
unfairly used city property for their reelection campaigns by buying 
city-printed absentee voter mailing labels. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Los Angeles County fire captain running for Lancaster City Council for 
the third time in Tuesday's election accused Mayor Arnie Rodio of threatening 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Registered voter David McBride complained that City Clerk Barbara Howard sold 
mailing labels of voters who had requested absentee ballots to the committees 
to reelect Councilmen George Root and Henry Hearns and Mayor Rodio. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates said they were not informed by the clerk's office that they 
could purchase the mailing labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Michael Singer said that when he called Howard after learning about 
the incumbents' joint flyer, she offered to print out the labels for him and 
said she hadn't thought to call all the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practice Commission said the issue would 
not fall under the commission's jurisdiction. However, she said she did not 
believe the city clerk would be under any obligation to call candidates and 
inform them that the mailing list was available. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman stressed that the question would fall under the city attorney 
or a city manager's jurisdiction. Neither official could be reached. However, 
the city's public information officer said city staff had determined earlier in 
the week that neither Howard nor the candidates were at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked into what had happened and incumbents had requested public 
information. And they paid $1.71 a sheet for mailing labels. This is a service 
that is available to any candidate or any citizen because they are public 
record," spokeswoman Nancy Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought copies of the labels, which is perfectly legal and above board," 
Root said. "They can file all the complaints they want. They're just grasping 
at straws." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Michael Singer, a Los Angeles County fire captain, accused Rodio of 
threatening his job during a confrontation Thursday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said Rodio told him after an argument: "You're a fire captain with the 
L. A. County Fire Department. I am going to show them what kind of a captain 
you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodio did not return telephone messages left at his office and home Friday 
afternoon.

NO ORDINARY FORUM; POLITICS: TEN HOPEFULS IN CARSON'S ELECTIONS FIELD TOUGH 
QUESTIONS FROM COALITION MEMBERS OF 4 LATINO GANGS WHO CREATED TRUCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tattooed Carson gang members with close-shaven heads, white T-shirts and baggy 
pants bunching over their shoes sat in chairs in the middle and back rows. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates dressed for success were lined up in a row at the front of the 
community room. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a run-of-the-mill candidates forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of four Latino gangs who created a truce more than a year ago 
sponsored the recent meeting. The coalition, known as the Harbor Area Action 
Committee, invited candidates running for mayor, City Council, treasurer and 
city clerk in the election. The response was impressive -- only city clerk 
candidate Samson C. Labasan did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 area residents, including 40 gang members, turned out to ask 
questions of the 10 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang members called for community centers and tutoring for dropouts who 
return to school. But most of all, they wanted to know which of the candidates 
could find them jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Coni Hathaway and Gayle L. Konig, both running for City Council seats, 
ventured to answer. "I'm not promising," Hathaway said. "There is no council 
person that can guarantee jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Konig cautioned that developing jobs could take time. "I don't think it's 
going to happen tomorrow," she said. "The bottom line is that a lot of people 
here aren't educated enough to take (many) jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates emphasized the importance of education and vocational training. 
A few tried to describe the intricacies of their jobs in city government, but 
when the discussion focused on whether retailer Ikea's sales-tax revenue was 
proprietary information, their audience, composed mostly of young men, got 
restless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to know about Ikea. We want to know about us," gang member 
Aaron Mora said in an exasperated tone. 
</P>
<P>
 When Keith McDonald, a council candidate and former professional football 
player, talked about his off-season training programs in local parks, he got a 
strong reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know nothing about this in the Mexican neighborhoods," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
 The session started about 45 minutes late because many gang members were wary 
of entering the Carson Community Center, which is in the same block as the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department station. 
</P>
<P>
 But after it got started, the meeting lasted three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Like moderators at other political gatherings, Eugene A. Urias and other forum 
organizers struggled to move the meeting along. 
</P>
<P>
 "People kept talking and taking too long," said Urias, whose family has 
belonged to a Keystone area gang for two generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang members might not appear to have a lot of political clout, since many 
of them are too young to vote or are ineligible for various reasons to cast 
ballots. But the Harbor Area Action Committee has emerged as a viable community 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group have been meeting since their truce began, and continue 
to organize in their neighborhoods. The group, which represents about 600 gang 
members, has sponsored football and baseball games, barbecues and a car show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got tired of us fighting against each other. We want to get involved with 
our city -- and get programs for our young people," said gang member Rudy 
Viveros. "I've got a kid now, and I want it to be better for my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the truce does not extend beyond the four Latino gangs that claim 
about one-third of Carson's neighborhoods, Mayor Michael I. Mitoma said. Urias 
said he would like to see other gangs eventually included in programs that the 
coalition hopes to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have everything set up with the city, we're going to reach out to 
other gangs," Urias said, adding that everyone would be welcome at the teen 
centers that Action Committee members hope to create. 
</P>
<P>
 Since December, the gang members have worked with Mitoma and Arthur Caracoza, 
chairman of the city's Human Relations Commission, organizing crews to paint 
over graffiti and discussing what the city can do to help their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral candidate James H. Peoples said he was pleased to see more interest in 
politics by any group, but he questioned Mitoma's new-found interest in helping 
the gang members, since he has been on the council for seven years.

FITNESS BUFFS WORK UP A SWEAT FOR AIDS RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 200 fitness buffs worked out for three grueling hours Saturday morning, 
sweating to raise $5,000 for AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, organized by the City of Hope National Medical Center near Los 
Angeles, was one of 120 "Sweat-A-Thons" held simultaneously throughout the 
country by the hospital to raise money for AIDS research and patient care. 
Twenty-thousand participants were expected nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 As music filled Orange Coast College's gymnasium, the mostly female group 
danced and jumped through a series of 15-minute aerobic programs, including 
"Slappin' Leather," and the "Electric Slide," both popular country steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so much fun, working out with all these people," said participant 
Robin Guild, 33, a personal trainer at Superbodies Gym in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Guild won a two-night stay at Newport Beach's Le Meridien Hotel for raising 
the most money, $373, through pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizer Barbara Wright, an aerobics instructor at Orange Coast 
College, said the City of Hope had a goal of $2 million nationwide. About a 
dozen volunteers from throughout Orange County organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 20 health-related businesses and sportswear companies set up 
booths in the gym, where their representatives offered advice, food, and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the sixth year that the hospital has held this event. It's an 
opportunity to work out and do something vitally important," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 aerobics instructors took turns leading the group, which began 
warm-ups at 9 a.m. and finished the day with circuit training, spending about 
20 seconds at each of 10 stations, where they engaged in different workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break to gulp down some water, David Wright, 32, a loan processor for 
Bank of America in Costa Mesa who had attended two previous Sweat-A-Thons, said 
this year's turnout was the largest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty strenuous out here," said Wright, who is no relation to the event 
organizer.

POLICE WOUND DRIVER AFTER BRIEF CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police officer shot and wounded a 25-year-old man who had tried to run over 
the officer and a partner with a car early Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinh The Nguyen, of Garden Grove, was arrested on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon on a peace officer, evading a peace officer and driving under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Nguyen had been driving a car erratically with the headlights off 
about 2 a.m. That attracted the attention of Sgt. Scott Watson, who was 
patrolling a residential area near Lampson Avenue and 9th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson tried to pull Nguyen's auto over but the driver fled in his car, Sgt. 
Joe Johnson said. A second officer in a patrol car joined the pursuit, and 
Nguyen led both into a cul-de-sac, he said. Police gave the following account: 
</P>
<P>
 When Nguyen pulled into the driveway of a home in the 11500 block of Dorada 
Avenue, officers blocked the exit with their patrol cars and got out to 
approach him. Nguyen then tried to escape, driving over a lawn between two 
trees and attempting to ram the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The second officer -- whose name was not released -- fired one shot at Nguyen, 
grazing him in the lower arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was treated and released from Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A car, when used in such a way, may be considered a weapon, Johnson said, and 
department policy allows police officers to fire at a suspect if lives are at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was being held Saturday at Orange County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at West Orange County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the district attorney's office are looking into the 
shooting, which is routine in officer-involved shootings in the county.

CRYSTAL COVE PARK REOPENS, WITH A WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crystal Cove State Park is scheduled to reopen this morning to hikers, 
bicyclists and equestrians after a six-month recovery from last fall's 
destructive wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready," said park ranger David Ruger."People have been waiting a long 
time for this." 
</P>
<P>
 The park, north of Laguna Beach, will reinstate its regular hours, 6 a.m. to 
sunset every day, with one new rule: that visitors stay off the new plants 
struggling to gain a foothold in the charred soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only place you can walk is on the trails," said Ruger. "Everywhere else 
is completely off-limits. It can be a very expensive ticket if we catch people 
off the trail." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruger said he hopes the crowd that shows up today isn't too large because the 
park environment is still fragile. "I sure wish we were opening on a weekday 
instead of a Sunday," he said. LYNN FRANEY

MARRIAGE STANDS THE TEST OF TIME AND SPANS 2 CONTINENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In preparation for their parents' recent wedding anniversary, Chan-Yong Kim 
and his brother and sister decided to look up the traditional names associated 
with anniversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The list says silver for the 25th anniversary, then gold for the 50th. If a 
couple makes it to 60 years, it's their diamond anniversary. But what about 
after that? 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knew the name for the 75th anniversary," Kim said. "I guess no one 
figured that any couple would be married beyond 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, on March 26, Kim's father, Jae-Ok Kim, and mother, Ok-Sun Kim, of 
Koreatown celebrated a union that has spanned three-quarters of a century and 
two continents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember ever having a fight," said Ok-Sun Kim, who at 87 is a year 
older than her husband. "The main thing is that we respect each other, always 
try to understand each other's situation and give rather than take." 
</P>
<P>
 As was the custom at the time in their native Korea, the marriage was arranged 
by the couple's parents. She was 12, he was 11.  
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, parents made the arrangements so as not to lose the 
opportunity for having a good son-in-law or a good daughter-in-law," explained 
Chan-Yong Kim, 60, the couple's eldest child. "Even before their children were 
born, friends often said, 'Let's get them married.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the wedding, the couple lived at his parents' house near the city of 
Kaesong, then part of a unified Korea and now in North Korea. They didn't live 
together as husband and wife until they were in their 20s, Chan-Yong Kim said. 
Jae-Ok Kim's job as a construction contractor took him all over Korea and 
China, so his wife kept up the house, tended the family farm and took care of 
her husband's eight siblings as well as their own three children. 
</P>
<P>
 With the outbreak of the Korean war, the family fled to the port city of 
Inchon and then moved to Seoul, South Korea, in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, the couple moved to the United States to be with their children, who 
had left South Korea to continue their educations and pursue careers in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they enjoyed being around their three children and eight 
grandchildren, the couple wanted friends their own age, so they moved into an 
apartment building in Koreatown where they became active in the Korean senior 
citizens' association and their local church. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Jae-Ok Kim has given lectures to schoolchildren about Korean 
philosophy and culture, practiced calligraphy and studied English. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's worn out a couple of Korean-English dictionaries," his son said. "And 
even though all his children wear glasses, he still doesn't need them." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan-Yong Kim said his father is somewhat conservative while his mother "has a 
more liberated side. It's a good blending." Unlike many older Korean couples, 
the Kims can occasionally be seen holding hands when they walk down the street, 
said Kyung-Yong Kim, their second son.  
</P>
<P>
 "God gave us health and happiness and we've enjoyed our time together," said 
Ok-Sun Kim, the more talkative of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan-Yong Kim, who runs a tae kwon do school in Cerritos, sees his parents as 
role models for younger couples: "Maybe times aren't always happy, but when an 
unfavorable situation develops, rather than saying, 'The heck with it,' there's 
always a way to reconcile the situation and work things out." 
</P>
<P>
 The family invited about 300 guests to the anniversary celebration at a 
Koreatown restaurant, but an additional 100 well-wishers showed up after local 
Korean-language newspapers ran stories about the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guinness Book of World Records lists two couples who were married for 86 
years, so the Kims have a goal to set their sights on. In the meantime, Ok-Sun 
Kim has a simple plan: "After all these years, my responsibility is to continue 
to love my husband, never hurt his feelings and and make sure he eats well."

FEWEST OFFICERS -- 4% -- LIVE IN CENTRAL L.A.; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THOSE WHO DO

 Police Lt. Thomas (Reggie) Maeweather grew up in Central Los Angeles and still 
lives in the area, and he believes that he is a better officer because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Maeweather, 46, commander of the detective detail at the Los Angeles Police 
Department's 77th Street Division, attended 75th Street Elementary School and 
graduated from nearby Fremont High. He and other officers who live in the area 
say it makes them more sensitive to the people they serve and has helped them 
better understand how poverty, broken families and desperation have pushed many 
residents into a life of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, I can understand it just by living in the community and having 
grown up and seen it," said Maeweather. A 19-year department veteran, he 
stresses that he is no apologist for those who break the law but is aware of 
the root causes behind many illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of police residency was thrust into the local spotlight with the 
recent release of an American Civil Liberties Union report finding that only 
17% of the Police Department's 7,658 sworn officers live in the city. The 
smallest concentration was in Central Los Angeles, home to 304 officers -- or a 
scant 4% of the force. An additional 34 officers live in several Southeast Los 
Angeles County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU officials contend that the residency patterns, coupled with factors such 
as the slow pace of police reforms, bolster longstanding beliefs that the LAPD 
is an occupying army with little connection to the communities it serves. The 
ACLU recommends that the city provide salary incentives, rental subsidies or 
special mortgage loan programs to attract officers to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not so naive as to say that residency patterns are the only issue that 
contributes to this isolation pattern, but they are part of the problem," said 
ACLU spokesman Allan Parachini. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials dispute the ACLU's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "To assume that an officer is less committed based on the location of the 
residence, in my view, is a quantum leap," said Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, 
commander of the department's South Bureau, which covers much of South-Central 
and Southwest Los Angeles. "I don't care where your bed is. I care where your 
heart is." 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the ACLU charted residency patterns from ZIP codes supplied by 
the department for all its sworn officers. The findings showed that the vast 
majority of officers reside outside the city and that many are concentrated in 
largely white, suburban communities in the Antelope Valley, West San Fernando 
Valley and Ventura County.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 304 officers who live in Central Los Angeles, 71 are in the area that 
includes the middle-class communities of Baldwin Hills, View Park and Ladera 
Heights. Another 32 reside in a roughly 6 1/2-mile strip of South-Central 
bordering the Harbor Freeway between Slauson Avenue and El Segundo Boulevard. 
The rest are scattered across the area, including 23 officers in Northeast Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Kenny Garner, who owns a home just blocks from the Wilshire Division 
station where he works, says living in the community is a distinct advantage, 
especially since the Police Department has pledged to move toward 
community-based policing. Garner says he has more incentive to find solutions 
to local crime problems and has a better understanding of residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a big difference," said Garner, 38, a 16-year veteran who supervises 
the day patrol watch and a special community-based policing unit assigned to a 
high-crime area in West Adams. "I think it just gives me a different 
perspective on policing and how I would like to see policing in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 For Garner, the choice to live in Mid-City was easy: He liked the ethnic 
diversity of the area, his home was reasonably priced and it is in the Wilshire 
Division. Until recently, he was assigned to the department's South Bureau 
headquarters near USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to Wilshire Division, I knew firsthand what the problems were," 
said Garner, who has lived at his home near Washington Boulevard and La Brea 
Avenue since 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 Garner, who grew up in South-Central, lived near 76th Street and Harvard 
Boulevard for a year while he was a patrol officer in the Southwest and 77th 
Street divisions in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Maeweather, a View Park homeowner, says his community connections have helped 
his investigations. "When you need information, you don't have to build 
relationships. You already have a connection with the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Maeweather added that being from the community can also be a psychological 
advantage for an officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's less of a sense of paranoia. I think people who grow up or 
live in the community tend to be more trusting. The fear factor isn't as 
great," said Maeweather, whose parents still live in the 77th Division area and 
who attends Faithful Central Missionary Baptist Church on Hoover Street. 
"You're not an outsider." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Maeweather and others point out, growing up or living in a 
community is no guarantee that a police officer will be more sensitive or 
responsive to residents' needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being committed has nothing to do with where you live," said Detective 
Gilbert Escontrias, who grew up in the rough Maravilla and Ramona Gardens 
housing projects on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 Escontrias, 35, who works in the Rampart Division and lives in Pico Rivera, 
has donated $900 of his own money to help three Eastside youths attend the Los 
Angeles Music School and helped build a library at Para Los Ninos, a Skid Row 
social service agency.  
</P>
<P>
 He said many officers live outside the city because they could be targeted by 
people they arrest. Other officers say that if an attacker wants to hunt down 
an officer, it will happen regardless of where he or she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone really wants to find you, they will," said Officer Keith Thomas, 
34, who is assigned to the 77th Division and lives within the precinct's patrol 
area. As a precaution, he says, he is always prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's ridiculous to wear your gun while you're out cutting the grass, 
but I do," Thomas said. "I can't think of anywhere I don't go where I don't 
take my gun." 
</P>
<P>
 What can help make officers more sensitive is exposure to different people in 
social or community events outside the context of law enforcement, which often 
deals with the negative aspects of society, said Lucky Altman, a 
community-police relations specialist with the National Conference, a service 
organization that provides cultural-awareness training for law enforcement 
agencies across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is in that context that police officers will open themselves up to 
different people and ideas," said Altman, who added that officers do not 
necessarily have to live in the community they serve to be culturally 
sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker, who lives in the Santa Clarita Valley, said officers are becoming 
involved with the community in various functions such as reading to children at 
libraries and working with the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity organization to 
build and refurbish homes in South-Central. "There's a whole bunch of things 
we're unleashing," he said.

Critics say the numbers bolster their argument that the LAPD has little 
connection to the communities it serves. Source: American Civil Liberties Union

 Teresa Dominguez has sold tacos along Hoover Street from a catering truck for 
years. But these days, Dominguez and other vendors find themselves in a dispute 
with residents who call the trucks a threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haul our trash away and pay all our licensing fees," said Dominguez. "We 
aren't doing anything illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents say catering trucks such as Dominguez's Tacos del Gordo are 
violating city parking codes and attracting gangs on Hoover Street near 22nd 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is these three trucks are out there constantly, until the wee 
hours of the morning. . . ," said Bob Byers, president of the North University 
Park Community Assn., a residents group formed in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Catering trucks may park for as long as 30 minutes in a residential area, or 
an hour in a commercial area, but are required to relocate at least one mile 
away after the time limit expires, according to Bob White, the city's parking 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 White said his department stepped up its patrols in the area after receiving 
complaints to ensure that the trucks do not overstay their visits, but said 
there has been no noticeable increase in the number of citations issued. He 
said that the trucks are complying with the parking laws for the most part, 
moving after the time limit expires and returning an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against anyone making a living, but I wish them to follow the law," 
Byers said. "Our concern is this is breeding trouble within the gangs. These 
trucks are becoming gang headquarters and we can see it. We're not blind." 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors such as Dominguez deny they are creating problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting has been scheduled Tuesday between the residents group and city 
officials, including Councilman Mike Hernandez's office, whose 1st District 
includes part of North University Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need information on what's going on, first of all," said David Marquez, a 
field deputy with Hernandez's office who will attend the meeting. "But we also 
need to have an understanding between the neighbors and the catering trucks so 
that there is room for coexistence." 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents say they are looking for the same respect for their 
neighborhood that other areas in the city enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we have a beef is this problem is only happening here," said one 
resident who did not want to be identified. "You don't see these trucks near 
the Beverly Center or the Westside Pavilion." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; STUDENTS GET THIRD PRINCIPAL IN A YEAR

 Students at Grape Street Elementary School returned from spring break to be 
greeted by their third principal in less than a year. Jeri Dunnigan said she 
hopes to focus her efforts on rebuilding community-school relations after her 
predecessor was allegedly assaulted last month by a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Morris-Mack was named principal in September, replacing Alvin 
Andrews, who was transferred to another school last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris-Mack left the 670-student school after she was allegedly assaulted by 
the mother of a 9-year-old who was suspended from the school after he 
accidentally killed Kimberly Bracey, 7, with a high-powered military-style 
rifle while the two were playing at his home.  
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges were filed against the boy or the adult who owned the gun, 
according to police Detective Paul Mize. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy found the gun in a bedroom of a boarder in the boy's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault on Morris-Mack took place during Kimberly's funeral, according to 
Wesley Mitchell, chief of the Los Angeles Unified School District Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said Morris-Mack was struck in the head by the woman's purse as she 
and her son left the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working on getting (the boy) reinstated to another school," said 
Yvonne Chavez, a regional director with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said that Morris-Mack has been out ill since the incident but 
declined to comment on her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed in the alleged assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working with the staff to find out what they feel they need to bolster 
up the morale and reduce stress," Chavez said. The district added patrols 
around the campus immediately after the shooting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My focus is on improving the students' achievement," said Dunnigan, who took 
over at Grape Street on March 21 after serving as an assistant principal in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though . . . I haven't had interaction with anyone at the housing 
projects, I know the needs of the students are great and I plan to do community 
outreach." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 The Weingart Urban Center YMCA is sponsoring free health education courses as 
part of its monthlong 10th anniversary celebration this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The courses -- on weight loss, blood pressure control and diabetes -- will 
start Monday in the newly renovated health and fitness center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weingart YMCA will sponsor an April 16 music festival featuring local 
youth choirs at USC's Annenberg School of Communication. Also scheduled is a 
free April 23 health clinic, which will include immunizations, dental 
check-ups, and eye and health exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at 9900 S. Vermont Ave., renovated its fitness center after 
raising more than $100,000 during a three-month fund drive. "This community has 
a higher need than most others for fitness, (which) most people think is a 
recreational thing. But people have a far greater need to be involved in 
preventive medicine," said Robert Wilkins, executive director of the Weingart 
YMCA. "People think poor folk have a greater agenda. They think, 'You need to 
learn to read before you get around to lifting weights or running around a 
track.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing this to mark our agenda for the next 10 years as we become more 
proactive as a health care provider in terms of fitness," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; PLAZA DE LA RAZA IS ACHING TO GROW

<P>
 At a long cafeteria table, Teresa Munoz sits with other women and their 
children, molding flowers, small hats and other knickknacks out of a pliable 
mixture of dough and glue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy for her," said Munoz, marveling at their teacher's mastery. "She 
makes a teardrop with one finger and then flowers and all sorts of things, all 
with one finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz and her daughters, Rebecca, 11, and Desiree, 7, are taking lessons in 
migajon , the traditional Mexican technique of using scraps of dough to create 
art, one of the after-school classes offered at Plaza de la Raza's School of 
Performing and Visual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school, which was established in 1978, has had a tough time in recent 
years, faced with an economy on the slide and a population on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not being able to expand (our programs), that is the hidden tragedy in this, 
said Director Gema Sandoval, "because our community has significantly grown and 
we end up turning people away.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our community needs more than ever programs that keep children on task, that 
give them a chance at success, and at the same time, the few programs that 
exist have a tough time making ends meet." 
</P>
<P>
 The school enrolls 350 to 600 students a week in dance, drama, art and music 
classes. Most students, she said, cannot afford the $35 fee for a 10-week 
session and are enrolled at a reduced fee. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has made fund raising more vital to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate donations account for 60% of the school's $250,000 annual budget, 
Sandoval said. The rest comes from government grants. Last year's donations 
amounted to $100,000 less than the previous year's, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the city, which has suffered a variety of natural disasters, all the 
traditional funding that we usually receive has been drastically reduced. For 
the first time in the history of Plaza de la Raza, we are looking for 
membership donations and having all these fund-raising parties that we have to 
have in order to keep the place going." 
</P>
<P>
 The school has had two fund-raisers this year and is working on a third in 
May; it usually has one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although shrinking budgets have not yet forced cuts in services or staff, 
their effects have been felt. For example, La Tiendita, the Plaza's store that 
sells professional arts and crafts, was closed for a week when the person in 
charge went on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members, who feared their benefits and wages would be cut as budgets 
tightened, approved joining the California Professional Employees Union in 
December. The union, which represents more than 700 members of nonprofit 
organizations, has requested a three-year contract for Plaza's eight support 
employees (not including teachers), increases in wages and benefits and an 
updated personnel policy.  
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the school's uncertainty is Sandoval's impending departure. The 
director recently announced that she will step down July 1 from the post she 
has held for seven years to commit more time to her dance group, Danza 
Floricanto. Plaza's board of directors has hired a consultant to search for a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvana Berberian, 17, has taken a variety of lessons for four years at the 
school and insists its teachers are more challenging than those at Reseda High 
School, where she is in the 11th grade. In the session that just ended, she 
took theater, cello, tap-dancing and folklorico dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place to get away. When I go in the door, it feels like a totally 
different world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berberian said that the theater classes have helped pull her out of her shell: 
"That's what I think helps me talk to people now. Before, I didn't talk. I 
would hide behind my mom, and now they have to shut me up." 
</P>
<P>
 The school wrapped up its winter session two weeks ago and begins its spring 
session April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are mostly children and teen-agers, but Sandoval said that when 
children are involved, the whole family usually is too: 
</P>
<P>
 "It changes the aspect of the park. There are no graffiti, drug and gang 
problems when you bring the whole family in." MARY ANNE PEREZ

 An eclectic group of performers and musicians will gather Friday at Plaza de 
la Raza to raise money for a 13-year-old poet with Epstein-Barr syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehecatl Chumacero of Pasadena received the diagnosis one month ago and has 
missed two months of school, said his mother, Olivia Chumacero.Ehecatl, who 
attended Washington Middle School, has undergone physical therapy and requires 
more medical attention. His medical bills have already reached $4,000 and will 
continue to rise, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chumacero, the mother of two, has no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor told us they don't have any Western cure for this, and they tell 
him to rest and eat well," said Chumacero, a writer and teacher of film and 
theater at Mujeres y Hombres Nobles, an alternative school in East Los Angeles. 
"I've met other people who have dealt with this and I'm trying to find out 
what's best for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The performers, including Luis Alfaro, host Diane Rodriguez and members of 
Latins Anonymous and Culture Clash, are friends of Chumacero's and have agreed 
to help. Other performers include Evelina Fernandez, Maria Elena Gaitan and the 
singing group Los Jalapenos. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $15 for the show, which begins at 8 p.m. Plaza de la Raza is at 
3540 Mission Road.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; DEATHS ADD URGENCY TO POLICE OUTPOST BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the carjacking slayings of two Japanese college students 
in San Pedro, Little Tokyo community leaders are stepping up their efforts to 
open a ko-ban, or police outpost, on 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two years, community leaders have sought to open a police outpost 
in Little Tokyo that would provide assistance in Japanese and English to crime 
victims. But the project became entangled in red tape at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the March 25 killings of the two Japanese students and the resulting 
concern about crime among visitors, Little Tokyo community leaders are drafting 
letters to Mayor Richard Riordan and other city leaders about making the ko-ban 
a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders have also added tourist information -- such as public 
transit schedules and sightseeing tips -- to the list of services they hope to 
offer at the ko-ban.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very fitting right now. We can provide tourists assistance at the 
ko-ban, " said Brian Kito, a Little Tokyo merchant and member of the Greater 
Little Tokyo Anti-Crime Assn., a community group spearheading the project. "The 
city should jump on board." 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders envision an outpost-information center staffed by bilingual 
volunteers. Police officers would stop in to take reports and provide 
information and assistance, similar to an arrangement used in Chinatown for the 
past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Such small police booths are found on many street corners in Japan, providing 
victims with a convenient and unintimidating place to report crimes. Little 
Tokyo community leaders hope a similar setup here will encourage crime victims, 
particularly tourists, to report even small incidents such as burglaries in 
cars. They say many crimes go unreported primarily because of the language 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-crime association has already gathered a corps of volunteers and has 
long eyed a store space in a city-owned building at 303-307 1/2 1st St. as a 
ko-ban site. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters has backed the proposal. But the early-1900s 
building has needed to be repaired and seismically improved. City construction 
crews had expected to have their work done by December, 1992, but a series of 
construction and bureaucratic glitches created delays and threatened the police 
outpost project. 
</P>
<P>
 One key problem that arose was a city plan for only two store spaces in the 
renovated building, rather than a restoration of the original four spaces. 
General Services Department officials believed two larger spaces would be 
easier to lease and utilize, particularly because there is a rather narrow 
street frontage, said Frank Mercier, a senior real estate officer for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would have left no room for the police outpost since two of the prior 
tenants, a restaurant and a water purification company, wanted to return to the 
building, community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 So ko-ban supporters enlisted the help of Walters and Gloria Uchida, the 
area's Community Redevelopment Agency project manager, who persuaded city 
general services officials to provide a third space in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have this thick bureaucracy . . . and it went around in circles," said 
Carolyn Cooper, a senior analyst in the City Administrative Officer's 
department who also supported the three-space concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said she expects repairs of the building to proceed quickly now that 
the number of spaces has been clarified. The city has budgeted about $600,000 
for the improvements. The money will come from seismic retrofit bonds approved 
by voters in 1990, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc Nghiem, a city structural engineer, said the building has been gutted and 
architects should have interior plans, which will include upgraded restrooms 
and improved access for the disabled, drafted by early May. 
</P>
<P>
 The project should go out to bid by June and construction, which is expected 
to last about four months, should begin by September, Nghiem said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do the best we can to speed it up," Nghiem said, although he noted that 
city construction and engineering employees have been occupied with Northridge 
earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, community leaders hope to get mayoral and City Council support for 
a low-rent agreement for the police outpost. The anti-crime association would 
like a nominal lease, such as the $1 per year that some other nonprofit groups 
and agencies pay for renting city properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alternative that community leaders want to discuss with city leaders 
is the idea of the anti-crime association becoming the building landlord and 
thus benefiting from the rents provided by the other two tenants. The 
association would sublease the spaces and use rent proceeds to help pay the 
police outpost's insurance and maintenance costs. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; GROUP TO STUDY HOW TO REVIVE BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried about the economic future of Chinatown, a new group of business 
professionals is studying the area's needs and determining how to revive its 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinatown Economic Development Council took shape over the past year to 
keep businesses and consumers in Chinatown. Businesses and shoppers who 
depended on Chinatown for ethnic goods and services are going elsewhere, 
particularly to the booming Chinese enclaves of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a situation that's been going on for several years. We need to take a 
serious look at what remedies and strategies there are," said attorney William 
Tan, one of about 15 core members. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American Economic Development Enterprises Inc., an organization that 
aids small businesses, has been instrumental in forming the new council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's first major step was to enlist another organization, Leadership 
Education for Asian Pacifics, to conduct a comprehensive study of the area's 
economic base. The results are expected to be released in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan said the study will address such questions as "What drives Chinatown?" and 
"What are its shortcomings?" 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the study's results, group members will discuss solutions. 
Some areas of improvement are evident, Tan said, such as the need to increase 
marketing efforts to battle attitudes among some consumers that Chinatown is 
unsafe, its goods lack value and its novelty is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 But a difference of opinion has already emerged, Tan said. Some say 
rejuvenation lies in offering more low-cost goods and swap-meet markets to 
consumers in recessionary times. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tan and others say that would be a short-term fix. Tan said a better mix 
and diversity of businesses may be the key to prosperity. The needs of an 
increasingly multiethnic community must also be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger picture is: 'What do you do tomorrow?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Borden, executive director of Asian American Economic Development 
Enterprises, said one strategy is to find ways to link Chinatown to regional 
development and transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, members of the new council have been lobbying the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority about locating a light-rail station in or near 
Chinatown for the potential Blue Line extension to Pasadena, Borden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan said the council was not formed to compete with the Chinese Chamber of 
Commerce and other long-established community groups. Rather, the council hopes 
to draw these organizations together to pull Chinatown from an economic brink, 
Tan said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Borden put it, even if the Asian community disperses throughout the county, 
"This is the emotional home of the Chinese in Los Angeles." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; 5 FAMILIES WIN SUIT OVER UNSAFE 
HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Five families who sued their landlord for ignoring substandard living 
conditions have been awarded more than $500,000 to cover back rent and 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one for the good guys," said Nelson L. Cohen, attorney for the 
plaintiffs, adding that his clients were "ecstatic" with the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who bring home $1,000 a month to feed a family of four. 
They're thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The property owner, Dr. Charles Sassoon, a Walnut Park-based obstetrician, was 
ordered on April 1 to pay $19,740 in back rent, $168,000 for distress, $350,000 
in punitive damages, and about $31,000 in interest, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is to be split equally among the five families. 
</P>
<P>
 Sassoon, however, said he would appeal the decision. The plaintiffs "don't 
deserve anything," he said. "I should be paid for what they did to me."  
</P>
<P>
 The jury trial in Norwalk Superior Court found Sassoon guilty of ignoring 
tenants' complaints of unsafe and unhealthful living conditions that ranged 
from rat infestation to raw sewage and numerous other code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 City building inspector Carlos Levario, who was a key witness for the 
prosecution, testified that the city inspected the 11-unit apartment complex at 
5516 Gotham St. about 40 times over an 18-month period beginning in July, 1991, 
in an effort to solve problems there. Most of the other tenants in the building 
had moved away by the time the five families filed suit, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the worse violations, Levario discovered, was an illegal garage 
conversion where sewage flowed under a baby's crib. "It was one of the worst 
properties I'd been in," Levario said. 
</P>
<P>
 A videotape documenting conditions at the property helped sway the jury, 
Levario said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Sassoon pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of failing to 
correct substandard living conditions at the Gotham Street building and was 
sentenced to three years' probation and fined about $2,500. Sassoon asserted 
that the tenants vandalized the property and then called city inspectors in a 
ruse to win free rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been treated very unjustly," Sassoon said last week. "Before they 
left, they broke the place and took pictures. I treated them very fairly. I did 
everything possible to keep the place in the best way possible that I could." 
</P>
<P>
 It is rare in Bell Gardens for tenants to file lawsuits on housing complaints, 
Levario said, but the success of this case could encourage tenants to take on 
negligent property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't usually pursue it this far," he said. "I wish they would. If 
more tenants would go after (landlords) legally and see what the law provides 
for them in health and safety, I think they'd be surprised." MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; NEW RESERVOIR NEARLY READY FOR USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the water from the tap may look the same, within a month residents will 
be drinking from the city's new state-of-the-art, 4-million-gallon reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5.4-million project will not be operational for four to six weeks, but 
city officials celebrated the reservoir's completion at a grand opening last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this city's history, this is a very unique and advanced project and we are 
very proud of it," said project manager Shafique Naiyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir, which is 30 feet deep and measures 140 feet by 260 feet -- 
enough to hold about one day's supply of water -- is buried under a 140-space 
parking lot in South Gate Park. The reinforced-concrete structure will treat 
and store water from four wells that were closed in 1985 because of 
contamination from PCE, or perchloroethylene, a solvent used to remove grease 
and dirt from metal. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir will use a built-in spray aeration process to remove PCE gases 
by churning them out of the water and funneling them through an overflow pipe 
and into the air, Naiyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposure to high levels of PCE vapors can cause problems ranging from eye 
irritation to breathing difficulties and lightheadedness. The Air Quality 
Management District approved the process and will not require the city to test 
for vapors, said Department of Public Works Director Jim Biery. 
</P>
<P>
 The water will be tested for PCE levels every two weeks and the wells will be 
tested every three months, city officials said. Reopening the wells, which are 
in South Gate Park, will help the city purchase less water from the 
Metropolitan Water District, Naiyer said. The city reservoir can supply water 
for about $250 per acre-foot compared to the $479 per acre-foot the city pays 
for water from the district, Naiyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After officials complete equipment testing, the reservoir will be dried, 
disinfected and filled for public use. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; SCHOOL'S NEW MAJOR MUSIC TO THEIR 
EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Park High sophomore Pearl Alvarez loves music more than just about 
anything. So when it was time to apply to high schools, the 16-year-old 
saxophone player's first choice was to attend a music magnet school. Huntington 
Park High School, on the other hand, was "a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez's tune has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm glad I did come to HP," she said, "because of the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez and 27 other young musicians are the first to take part in an 
innovative program that allows them to major in music while attending their 
local high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The music major, the only program of its kind at any of the regular high 
schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, was launched in January by 
music teacher Edward Trimis. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimis came to Huntington Park in 1991 and is credited with pulling the music 
program back from the brink of extinction, increasing student participation 
from about 30 to 470 singers and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimis designed the music major when he realized that some of his students 
wanted to pursue music in college. "One of my students said he wanted to be a 
music teacher, and I thought, What have I taught him? What does he need to know 
to be a music major?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To answer those questions for future students, Trimis designed a comprehensive 
regimen that he believes will prepare students for advanced training and 
attract more music students to Huntington Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park youngsters interested in music often had to travel about an 
hour from home to attend Hamilton High School in West Los Angeles, the closest 
of three music magnets in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Park music major will be at least as comprehensive as programs 
offered at magnets, Trimis said, and will require students to complete at least 
60 credits of instrumental and vocal instruction, music theory and history, and 
teacher training. Music majors will also act as ambassadors for the program by 
spending at least 10 hours tutoring students at the high school or at local 
middle and elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who complete the program will be awarded special certificates upon 
graduation, Trimis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy is that kids that think highly of themselves and have high 
self-esteem will do well in life," Trimis said. "This is really special and 
something that's not found elsewhere. Now they think, 'Wow. We're special. 
We're music majors.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy appears to be taking root. Music students brag about how crowds 
will come to a losing football game just to watch the marching band, and the 
band members look forward to their first tour to San Francisco next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real serious about applying to a music magnet," said 15-year-old 
Christian Puerta, a bass player. "But I think I'll stick it out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The program could be a model for other schools, said Don Dustin, the district 
director of performing arts. "If they can pull it off at a year-round school 
which is in a blue-collar area, a lot of schools can do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the excitement, school officials warn that music students will most 
likely need to take some of their music courses while they are off track, to 
ensure a balanced curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can take all these music classes, but if they can't take the other 
electives like math and language and science that some colleges look at, that 
becomes a problem," said Pete Glos, head counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the program looks impressive on paper, Dustin is concerned that it 
could prove too big for the school to handle. Trimis could face staffing and 
funding problems and other obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dustin has faith in Trimis, who has been called the "pied piper" of 
Huntington Park music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling (Trimis) is going to pull it off because he has that kind of 
drive," Dustin said. "He doesn't take no for an answer." MARY HELEN BERG

 Seven members of the Dorsey High School track team recently went a distance

 "The race was a challenge," said 17-year-old Anthony Hinton, "but the real 
victory was seeing the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 At the invitation of the South Korea-based company Kolon International Corp., 
the group traveled to South Korea as good-will ambassadors of Los Angeles' 
African American community. The delegation also included seven runners from 
Gardena High. Kolon representative Bronnie Lee traveled with the students, 
acting as interpreter and tour coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to help try and bridge the gaps between the black and Korean 
communities," said Lee, credit manager of the Los Angeles division of Kolon, a 
billion-dollar import-export firm that manufactures a sporting goods line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was less about winning a race and more about bringing students together 
through cultural education." 
</P>
<P>
 Kolon picked up the $35,000-plus tab for plane tickets, food and hotel 
accommodations. The annual national marathon for high schoolers pitted the two 
Los Angeles groups against 27 relay teams from South Korea, China and Japan. 
Although the U.S. group -- the first Americans ever invited to participate -- 
finished last, students said they were happy just to be part of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have chosen a better team from another school, like San Pedro, but 
they chose us," said Hinton, a senior who specializes in the 400 meters. "But 
we were treated very well. People encouraged us on, waving and clapping. 
Everyone was so hospitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey Coach Paul Knox, who with Assistant Principal Beverly Clarkson 
accompanied students to South Korea, said his team rarely runs more than three 
miles for an event, even the cross-country runners. None had ever run five-mile 
legs in a 26-mile marathon.  
</P>
<P>
 For Betty Butler, 15, the race was grueling but the trip was eye-opening in 
more ways than one. "I never thought I'd be able to do something like this," 
she said. "I really enjoyed it. The Korean culture there is very different than 
the culture here." 
</P>
<P>
 During the students' six-day stay, Lee took them on whirlwind tours of 
museums, palaces, historical sites and cultural events in Kyongju, Korea's 
ancient capital city, and Seoul. Students got a chance to witness a traditional 
Korean wedding, compare and contrast the countryside with the bustling big 
cities, hear Korean music and visit a high school that specializes in training 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most impressive thing -- the school, the discipline," said 
Anthony Wheeler, 17. "Koreans really seem to support themselves as a people. 
They buy their own products. That's something blacks here need to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The culture shock, from acquiring tastes for seaweed to learning that Korean 
business manners differ greatly from those of Americans, were not entirely new 
for Dorsey runner Cyrena Thomas. Thomas' father is black and her mother is 
Korean. Still, the trip was something of a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up here and only speak a few phrases of Korean," the 15-year-old said. 
"My parents were glad about this trip, because they always felt I should know 
that other side of my culture. Now I feel like I do." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; POLICE STATION ON WHEELS GETS FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department has received a $95,000 federal grant to help pay for a 
mobile police station in the Wilshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the station will operate in the entire division, but that 
heavy emphasis will be placed on patrolling neighborhoods in Koreatown. During 
the past year, residents and business owners have become increasingly vocal 
about crime in the Koreatown area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something should have been done a long time ago. Nevertheless, we think the 
mobile unit is a great idea," said business owner Yohngsohk Choe, an anti-crime 
activist and member of the Wilshire Division Community Police Council. "We need 
all the assistance we can get." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Division, which covers part of Koreatown and portions of the 
Mid-City and Southwest areas, is the most violent of the four precincts in the 
department's West Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the division logged 77 homicides, 132 rapes, 3,856 robberies and 
2,864 assaults, according to department data. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the mobile station will help the department reach out to the 
division's heavily immigrant residents, many of whom are afraid or unable to 
travel to the Wilshire station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to create a lot more interaction with the community," said Sgt. 
Frank Hurtado, who coordinates the station's lead officers involved in 
community-based policing. "This will be a welcome addition in Wilshire." 
</P>
<P>
 Choe agreed. "Residents will have access to cops right in the problem areas," 
he said. "It's what community policing is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado said the station will be a mobile home outfitted with department 
computers and telecommunications equipment. It will also have a small holding 
room where suspects can be processed. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grant is part of the U.S. Justice Department's Community Projects 
for Restoration Program and will be augmented by an additional $20,000 from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grant was announced last week by U.S. Sens. Diane Feinstein and 
Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime in Los Angeles is simply out of hand," Feinstein said in a written 
statement. "This mobile unit will be the fourth of its kind, working out of the 
Wilshire area community police station and focusing on the Koreatown 
community." ROBERT J. LOPEZ

YMCA NEEDS VOLUNTEERS FOR SOCCER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the vacant lot at 3rd and Bixel streets is to be turned into a 
temporary soccer field, volunteers are needed to establish a recreation program 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 An alliance of neighbors, businesses, social service agencies, the 
Ketchum-Downtown YMCA and the police persuaded Cathay City Development, the 
owner of the property, to allow the lot to be used for recreation in the 
absence of immediate development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA seeks coaches, insured drivers, grant writers and people who can help 
with security or teach gardening, art or pet care. In addition, the Y needs 
volunteers who are bilingual in Spanish or Korean and anyone who can maintain a 
computer database for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are also needed to survey schools, churches and community 
organizations in developing a plan to transport children to and from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Recreation Field Project Team will meet at 5:30 p.m. Monday and 
April 25 on the second floor of the Mayfair Hotel, 1256 West 7th St.

COVER STORY; SHE-NANI-GANS N. (COLLOQ.) 1.) NONSENSE; MISCHIEF 2.) THE CURRENT 
STATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS IN THE AREA KNOWN AS THE HUB CITIES -- BELL, 
BELL GARDENS, CUDAHY, COMMERCE, HUNTINGTON PARK, MAYWOOD, SOUTH GATE AND VERNON 
-- WHERE EXPERTS SAY THE POLITICAL INSTABILITY IS A REFLECTION OF DEMOGRAPHIC 
AND ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL.

 PICTURE A TYPICAL RED-WHITE-AND-blue sort of ribbon-cutting ceremony, the type 
held in towns everywhere. City Council candidates nod approvingly during the 
dedication of a new sports program at the youth center. Parents and their 
children mill about, sharing hot dogs, sodas and the latest gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, good manners dissolve and one candidate allegedly shoulder slams 
another's 16-year-old cheerleader daughter. Assault charges are filed with the 
police department and the two candidates, former political allies, go to court. 
One candidate seeks a temporary restraining order. The other tells the judge 
the whole incident is imaginary. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to election season in Southeast Los Angeles County, where politics as 
usual is anything but. 
</P>
<P>
 From Vernon to South Gate and Huntington Park to Bell Gardens, local politics 
in the area known as the Hub Cities is often a hubbub of conflict and scandal. 
Even to a jaded electorate that has come to expect political infighting and 
allegations, the consistent record of controversy in the densely populated 
12-square-mile area stands out. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider recent history in Bell Gardens alone. In addition to the alleged 
assault on a candidate's daughter, there have been two recall campaigns 
launched in the past three years; closed session chair-throwing; allegations of 
voter fraud after the last two elections, and a council member fined $1,500 by 
the Fair Political Practices Commission for casting a vote illegally.  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, incumbent candidate Josefina Macias alleged that she received 
threatening letters and that her husband was run off the road by her opponents' 
supporters. Allegations of jobs and scholarships offered in return for votes 
and accusations of other political dirty tricks abound.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Andy Romero has told council members that he has turned so many 
city investigations over to the District Attorney, the office is overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Things have gotten so bad that "people feel embarrassed" to admit they live in 
Bell Gardens, said Councilwoman Rosa Hernandez, who is seeking her second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask where they live, they say: 'A little place near Downey.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Bell Gardens politics is still recovering from the animosity created 
by the historic 1991 recall campaign that ousted four white council members and 
gave the city it's first Latino council majority. But while the recall may have 
focused a media microscope on that city's political blemishes, it is not the 
only place in the Southeast where politics is said to be, if not dirty, in need 
of a good dusting. 
</P>
<P>
 * In tiny Cudahy, where a half dozen recall campaigns have been launched in as 
many years, one finally reached the ballot last year. Councilman John O. 
Robertson survived a recall effort organized by his four council colleagues 
only to become an issue in this year's election -- and he isn't even a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson and two other men agreed to pay a $39,000 settlement in October 
after being named in a civil suit alleging that they misused funds from the Hub 
Cities Consortium, a regional job training program. But the defendants missed 
the December payment deadline and fees now amount to about $55,000. Robertson 
backs two council candidates who, some fear, if elected would vote to have the 
city pay his debt. Robertson asserts no fraud was found and it is the city's 
legal responsibility to support him. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Huntington Park, Councilman Luis M. Hernandez, running for his second 
term, still owes the Fair Political Practices Commission $10,000 from more than 
$20,000 in fines for violations he racked up during two other campaigns. The 
FPPC charged Hernandez with 11 violations of campaign disclosure practices in 
two campaigns, which it said "denied the public important information" before 
the two elections. The fines, Hernandez said, are "merely a smudge on my record 
rather than something that should take me out office. We feel we were fined 
substantially for first-time offenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hernandez ally and political newcomer MariCarmen Medrano has asked 
the district attorney to investigate alleged fraudulent use of absentee ballots 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * In South Gate, candidate Ted Moore, a vocal council critic who was summarily 
dismissed from the planning commission this year, temporarily vanished. Moore, 
who many depended on as council watchdog, filed candidate's papers and then 
disappeared without notifying the city. After some investigative work, 
officials determined that he had sold his house. Moore was missing for several 
weeks before he called City Clerk Nina Banuelos to inform her he was in Las 
Vegas and insisted he was still a candidate. He still has yet to surface in 
South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-city region that lies southeast of Downtown Los Angeles -- Bell, 
Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Commerce, Huntington Park, Maywood, South Gate and Vernon 
-- is a residential landscape characterized by single-family homes, card 
casinos and factories. Settled by Midwesterners and Dust Bowl refugees who 
sought a better life in California, the area was until the 1970s a middle-class 
white community where bustling industry backed up to thriving neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past 20 years, the Southeast area has become a first stop for 
Latino immigrants and one of the poorer, more overcrowded regions in the state. 
Between 1980 and 1990, the population in Southeast cities grew by up to 33% and 
most of the newcomers were Latino. During the same period, heavy industry and 
some of the area's largest employers, such as General Motors, moved away, 
leaving toxic waste sites to clean up and thousands of people unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 If political instability and malfeasance in the area appear epidemic, the 
turbulence is no mystery, experts say. Local politics are a reflection of the 
demographic and economic upheaval in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really tough time to be councilman in one of these Southeast cities," 
said political scientist Fernando J. Guerra, who heads the Chicano studies 
department at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demographic shift is understated and understudied in the Southeast," 
Guerra said. "The area has gone from 95% white to 80% and . . . up to 95% 
Hispanic. The area has deindustrialized and the tremendous transition that is 
occurring creates instability and political insecurity. . . . Until the late 
1980s, the councils weren't representative, but they were stable." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the overwhelmingly Latino population, five of the eight city councils 
still have white majorities. But whether political representation of Latinos 
has come with a jolt, as in Bell Gardens, or more gradually, as in Huntington 
Park, all the local city councils have begun to reflect their changed 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who assumed that Latino representation would mean harmony was sorely 
disappointed to see the Bell Gardens council break into bickering so fierce 
that two members now rarely speak. In Huntington Park, the Latino majority does 
not vote as a bloc. In fact, Councilman Hernandez's campaign rhetoric targets 
incumbent Raul Perez, also seeking his second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disagreements shouldn't surprise anyone because "Latinos cannot be 
identified as a political entity" any more than whites or African Americans, 
said David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Alta California Research Center, a 
Los Angeles think tank that studies Latino issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, Hayes-Bautista said, is that in many cases the new crop of 
Latino council members has been ill-prepared to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, California's Latino community has had few institutions to 
nurture leadership, Hayes-Bautista said. Unlike the African American community, 
where churches and black colleges and universities have provided stages to test 
aspiring leaders, few Latino leaders enter the political arena with experience; 
thus, they are making their mistakes in the harsh public limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic hard times have made the transition from white to Latino control even 
more difficult. Latinos elected to represent the concerns of working-class and 
poor constituents have had to impose utility taxes, assessments and budget cuts 
to steady sinking city budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have representation in those communities now, but (new Latino leaders) 
need to deal with very real problems there," said Larry Berg, director of the 
Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. "They're at a distinct 
disadvantage because they don't have the resources to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates and incumbents acknowledge that council battles in the Southeast 
area have contributed to the region's turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park Councilman Raul R. Perez said city councils should use 
political appointments and other means to nurture potential leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time I criticized the council because they didn't prepare anyone 
to take over when they left," said Perez, who is seeking his second term. "I 
appointed a couple of people (to commissions) who are running against me now, 
but I can't criticize them because they have to cut their teeth somehow."  
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, council challenger Maria Victoria Martinez has included 
parenting, leadership and citizenship classes in her platform. Residents need 
to take responsibility for the community and help keep their leaders 
accountable, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "So many people here are new immigrants and they aren't used to speaking out 
and taking leadership roles," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter apathy and a large non-citizen population play a role in lack of 
accountability in the area, observers said. About 40% to 50% of residents in 
the Southeast cities are not U.S. citizens, according to the 1990 Census. Of 
those registered to vote in the 1990 Bell election, 16% turned out. The 1992 
election was canceled because the incumbents drew no challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of media coverage is also a problem in the area, said Gregory Rodriguez, 
a researcher with the Alta California Research Center, who has studied the 
Southeast region. The South Gate Press and other local newspapers stopped 
publishing by 1992, creating a communication gap between city officials and 
residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "Politics becomes irrelevant because no one knows what's happening," Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City council candidates rallied some voters in 1992 by making race and 
representation into campaign issues. This year, 35 of 53 candidates are Latino, 
bread-and-butter issues such as accountability and crime are back in vogue, and 
some question whether having Latino leaders has made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Gate, where the council still has a white majority, "some people say 
it should be a Latino council because the majority of us are Latino," said 
Victorio Gutierrez, a South Gate High School teacher. "But it doesn't matter if 
you're white, pink or blue, you still need to be accountable. . . . It doesn't 
matter who gets in as long as they listen to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, home of what some called a Latino revolution, voters "are 
ashamed" of their Latino leaders, said a longtime resident who would identify 
himself only as Ramon. "They say we have Latinos in there, but it was better 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 But even dogged Bell Gardens critics, such as former council candidate Victor 
Vaillette, said the leadership has matured and members have overcome initial 
gridlock to enact innovative policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent approval of a city-sponsored student loan program and support for a 
badly needed family health clinic demonstrate the council is capable of 
proactive policy that addresses some of the community's more pressing concerns, 
Vaillette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Latinos on the council has encouraged Huntington Park residents to 
participate in city meetings and programs, said Rudy Griego, a Huntington Park 
businessman and former Chamber of Commerce president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latino leaders make (residents) want to vote and feel (the city) is theirs," 
said Rodriguez of the Alta California Research Center. "That will translate 
eventually into better government." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Southeast cities worked together to bring a branch of East 
Los Angeles College to Huntington Park is also an example of Latino leaders 
having an impact in the region, said Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia 
(D-Huntington Park).  
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly don't think that would have happened without Latino leaders on the 
councils," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials in many cities said the campaigns this year have been 
relatively calm despite some requisite sign-stealing and name-calling. Still, 
fierce battles are being waged in Huntington Park and Bell Gardens, among other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park Councilman Luis Hernandez and maverick MariCarmen Medrano have 
faced off against incumbent Raul Perez, former state legislative aide Rosario 
Marin and real estate agent Jessica Maes. There, camps are trading allegations 
of voter fraud and misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, opponents of challenger Maria Chacon allege that her camp is 
using bribery, intimidation and fraud to win the election, charges that Chacon 
vehemently denies. Chacon, a catalyst in the 1991 recall movement, has split 
with incumbent Josie Macias and teamed on the ticket with Planning Commissioner 
Ramiro Morales. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in Maywood, Bell Gardens and Huntington Park are among those 
pushing residents to vote by absentee ballot and hoping to lock up their 
victories before Election Day. Maywood City Clerk Samuel A. Pena said he has 
had more than 800 requests for absentee ballots in a city where only about 
1,200 voted in the previous municipal election. Large numbers of candidates -- 
11 in South Gate and nine in Huntington Park -- also have complicated the races 
and are certain to make them closer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the beleaguered councils stumble into maturity, real stability in the 
Southeast area could be a long time coming, Rodriguez said. In Bell Gardens, 
officials have estimated a 30% transience rate in the city and less than 25% of 
the 42,000 homes are owner-occupied, numbers that illustrate the instability of 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the Southeast region remains an entry point for new immigrants -- a 
highly mobile population -- community leaders need to find ways to incorporate 
non-citizens into the political life of the city, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to a Bell Gardens student loan program -- which requires parents to 
remain in the city while students are accepting city money and includes a 
community service component -- as an innovative example of programs that can 
encourage residents to stay put and become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Southeast area) is at a nascent stage, but it will coalesce and get past 
the chair-throwing," Rodriguez said. "I don't think you can categorize these 
cities by allegation and indictments. This is only a snapshot in time and it 
will pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's election is not expected to be a major turning point for the 
Southeast area, but another small step in the area's maturation process. If the 
region can overcome its growing pains, Rodriguez said, it has the potential to 
become a regional political power to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will bring pride back to the city of Bell Gardens," Councilwoman Hernandez 
stated at a recent council meeting. "We just need to survive this period." City

 South Gate City Council candidates wait for their turns at the podium as 
another gives a speech during a recent forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Council elections, and politics in general, in the Southeast Los Angeles 
County Hub Cities are often characterized by finger-pointing, name-calling and 
sometimes bizarre accusations. Experts say the political instability in those 
cities is a reflection of demographic and economic upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 The messy incidents so common to Southeast politics are "blemishes of 
perfectibility on the road to democracy," said H. Eric Schockman, a writer and 
professor of California municipal politics at USC.

MONDAY DEADLINE FOR PROPERTY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second installment of 1993-94 property tax bills will become delinquent if 
not received by the county assessor by 5 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 County Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn said the second installment will be deferred 
for property owners who have filed both an application for tax deferral and an 
application for reassessment due to damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners are responsible for paying taxes when due regardless if they 
have received a bill. Substitute tax bills are available at the assessor's 
regional offices, which are listed in the phone book.

SUCCESSES MOUNT AT SHEENWAY SCHOOL -- BUT SO DO BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH HASTINGS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hope is a scarce commodity in the heart of Watts. But at the Sheenway School 
and Culture Center, it springs eternal from the heart of Aunt Dolores. 
</P>
<P>
 Her real name is Dolores Sheen Blunt, but to 42 African American students in 
brown plaid uniforms, she is simply Aunt Dolores -- a take-no-guff, 
stand-up-straight, spit-that-gum-out kind of principal who does something very 
special at this private school at 10101 S. Broadway, in the rumbling shade of 
the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt teaches respect, self-pride and manners in a neighborhood often short on 
all three. She teaches reading and writing and arithmetic too, but don't expect 
to find much in the way of institutionalized book learning at Sheenway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got all kinds of state-approved textbooks the kids use as a resource 
and for research," Blunt said. "I rarely use them when I teach." 
</P>
<P>
 What she does use, in a one-room-schoolhouse setting for 
preschool-through-12th-grade students, is simple common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go by what they don't know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day begins with morning assembly, where the children line up in neat rows 
to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and to sing their alma mater ("Sheenway 
takes us, Sheenway makes us true to what we are . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
 Each day also brings assorted conflicts of human nature. On a recent 
afternoon, two boys stood before Blunt, one seething, the other contrite. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been arguing, and the exchange had degenerated into critiques of each 
other's mother. Blunt, in a low, steady voice, admonished them to "find 
someplace to talk and come to some conclusion and write it down so I can see it 
tomorrow morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt, a medium-sized woman with salt-and-pepper hair, then looked the angry 
student straight in the eye. "Robert," she said evenly, "your temper's going to 
be the death of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Aunt Dolores' charges come from all points on the spectrum of societal ills. 
Some show signs of sexual abuse. Others have parents who are in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 One 10-year-old boy, now being raised by grandparents, had been locked in a 
trunk as a toddler while his father had sex with prostitutes in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lay there in the dark, in the trunk, hearing everything," Blunt said, 
shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolisha Smith comes here joyously, determined to study hard and make something 
of herself. Her 14-year-old brother is a gangbanger, and she frets that "he 
could get killed on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, single parent Gloria Bluitt, has high hopes for the 9-year-old. 
"She would not miss a day out of school," Bluitt said proudly. "She had a fever 
and was sick for two days, and every day she wanted to get up and go to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Bluitt also has hope for her son, even though he seems beyond it. Nothing 
fazes him, she says, not even the body of a Crips gang member she dragged her 
son to see, lying in the street with its face blown off by a shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son's reaction was not what she had hoped for. "He fell out laughing," the 
mother said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the kind of children Blunt wants to save. "It seems natural to me to 
want to take care of the helpless," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That mission is exactly what her father, Dr. Herbert A. Sheen, envisioned when 
he founded the school in 1971, six years after the Watts riots ravaged this 
neighborhood. He died in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so wise, I just automatically accepted his terms," Blunt said, 
explaining why she gave up her own desire to become a doctor and took over 
Sheenway instead. "He thought that education was the only way to empower his 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheenway began as a preschool. Over the years, higher grades were added as 
more and more children came here, their parents complaining of violence and 
inadequate public school curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 400 students on Sheenway's waiting list, all of them needing 
financial assistance. Tuition is $260 a month, but few parents can afford that, 
so Blunt uses a sliding scale. Consequently, the school relies heavily on 
private donations and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt, 55, raised her five children along with the other students. Once 
widowed and once divorced, her longest-lasting commitment is to Sheenway. 
</P>
<P>
 It has nearly gone under several times. Richard Pryor rescued Sheenway about 
13 years ago by donating $100,000. Lionel Ritchie bailed her out four years ago 
with $45,000 -- an amount she owed the Internal Revenue Service for employer 
tax payments that were embezzled by a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters, who represents Watts, is a frequent contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she is a wonderful human being who has dedicated her life to that 
school," Waters said. "There's nothing she could ask me to do that I wouldn't 
do. I love her, because no matter what kind of problems she runs into -- and 
she's had a few, I tell you -- she finds a way to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank is threatening to foreclose on Blunt's home, which she has mortgaged 
twice to keep the school going. A balloon payment of $190,000 is due, and Blunt 
doesn't have it. She draws no salary from Sheenway and is financially supported 
by her son and personal donations from friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put it in God's hands," said Blunt, standing in Sheenway's kitchen on a 
recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them they could keep the house. But I've got to find somewhere else to 
live," she said. "Not here. If I lived here, I wouldn't get no rest. I'd have 
dying babies on my doorstep, people needing counseling." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, she is at the school most days from early morning to past 9 p.m., 
planning menus, supervising day care and watching weekly karate classes. 
Volunteers teach dance, music and photography. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Anderson, a student at Cal State Northridge, teaches phonics as part of 
her work toward a master's degree in special education. 
</P>
<P>
 "My roommate went here," says Anderson, 25. "The ideals are terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 As Blunt scurried off to handle a minor crisis involving a cut finger, 
Anderson confided: "She needs a lot more help. She takes on a lot. She knows 
everything about every one of her kids. It's too much for one person."

ANALYSIS; LATINOS WAIT IN VAIN FOR RECRUITERS TO COME CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White men can't jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Black men are all natural athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Latinos? 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever created these absurd basketball stereotypes seems to have overlooked 
someone: the area's Latino basketball players go unrecognized by Division I 
college programs come scholarship time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches agree that there's a reluctance on the part of many college 
recruiters to take a chance on Latino players, who don't get the kind of 
exposure while in high school needed to attract the interest of Division I 
programs in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball is a sport dominated by non-Latino athletes and therefore, if a 
player is not black or white, many may say he is not athletic," said Los 
Angeles City College basketball Coach Mike Miller. "Coaches and people in the 
media are also a little guilty of stereotyping." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 16 players named to the All-City Section 4-A Division Team this year, 
10 were from the Central City area. Six-foot-one Joe Covarrubias of Huntington 
Park was the only Latino on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven representatives from the Central City area were named to the 3-A team. 
Four -- Jerry Espinoza of Bell, Gerardo Roman of Lincoln and Roosevelt's Mario 
Hernandez and Paul Burgueno -- are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Covarrubias averaged 20 points and six assists last season. Roman averaged 27 
points and Espinoza, 20. None of them received scholarship offers from a 
Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Gomez found himself in the same predicament last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, who averaged 26 points and nine rebounds for Garfield High, was the 
only Latino named to the 1993 City Times All-Star Team. Gomez, 6-5, led the 
area in scoring but was not offered a scholarship from a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez made the UC Irvine team as a walk-on but quit three weeks later.  
</P>
<P>
 "Walk-ons don't receive scholarships," Gomez said. "I had to quit because I 
needed a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said he would like to try again next year as a walk-on, but remains 
uncertain. "The school is raising its fees and I probably won't be able to 
afford it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LACC's Miller is familiar with the prejudice Latino basketball players 
encounter. "Many (Latino players) need a coach who will give them a chance and 
care about them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller coached at Cathedral High School from 1987-89 and amassed a 43-11 
record with an all-Latino team. The Phantoms won two consecutive Santa Fe 
League Championships and went to the Southern SectionFinal Four both years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's top player at Cathedral was Luis Fuentes, who earned All-Southern 
Section honors and was voted Most Valuable Player of the Santa Fe League in 
1989. Fuentes, who was not offered a Division I scholarship, went to Glendale 
College where he played little, became discouraged and gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Miller: "Those were some of the most dedicated kids I have ever coached. 
Many of these players are victimized by the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell High Coach Randy Kiehm offered another perspective. "At many of the 
Southeastern Conference schools there are kids 6-2, playing in the post that 
don't get the exposure of handling the ball," he said. "A 6-2 post player is 
not going to make it at the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 USC basketball Coach George Raveling said coaches are responsible for getting 
their players adequate exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "High school coaches have an obligation to sell their kids," he said. "Maybe 
the kids (in that area) being overlooked are not getting out to the summer 
camps and summer leagues where they can be seen. Ethnic background doesn't make 
a difference. If a guy can play, I don't think anyone cares what nationality he 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who guided the Trojans to a birth in the National Invitation 
Tournament last season, added: "College coaches are always accused of only 
being interested in winning. If that's true, wouldn't coaches be there looking 
at these kids? If a coach called me and told me that they had a kid that I 
should see, either I or one of my assistants would be there."

 The reason why I, Joe Covarrubias Jr., am the basketball player that I am is

 I remember everything you used to tell me about shooting a free throw: Take a

 You used to call me "Big-One" when I was just 6. I never understood why. It 
was as if you knew something I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if you knew that this year I would make the City Section 4-A Division 
first team and the City Times' first team as Huntington Park's starting point 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 You had to know, because before you died, on Dec. 4, 1992, you told me that I 
would be recognized for my talents one day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why when I went to Gage Junior High School, I would get up at 5:30 
every morning to go outside to practice dribbling. Sometimes Mom wouldn't let 
me go out, so I would dribble around the house. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first hint of daylight, I would run down to the park and play 
basketball all day. People would play and leave. Many of my friends were out at 
parties. But I stayed, practicing and dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
 All I've ever wanted was to lead my team to a City championship. I was never 
able to accomplish that in my four years at Huntington Park but I did mature as 
a player and as a person. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to think scoring was the most important aspect of the game. My junior 
year, I averaged 25 points and six assists -- second in the area -- but we lost 
a lot of games. Twelve out of 19, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 That summer, I watched Jason Kidd, who played point guard for Cal at the time, 
in a college basketball game. I noticed the way he handled the ball when 
closely guarded by a defender as opposed to dribbling in the open court. I 
studied the way he drew defenders toward him and then passed to an open man for 
an easy shot. I started taping the games he played in and then tried to emulate 
what I'd seen him do. 
</P>
<P>
 I realized that being the point guard on a basketball team is not that much 
different from being the quarterback on a football team. 
</P>
<P>
 So last season, I tried to get my teammates more involved offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 I averaged fewer points -- 20 -- and more assists -- seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Although our record improved very little, 9-13, we did play every game tough. 
</P>
<P>
 I could feel that I was getting better as a player, but I feared it might not 
be good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that Latino basketball players in our area do not receive the same 
respect and recognition from Division I college recruiters as non-Latino 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992-93, 6-6 center Alex Gomez of Garfield High was named to the City 
Times' first team, averaging 26 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't receive one scholarship offer from a Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, not one player from Roosevelt, the City 3-A runner-up to Banning, 
has signed to play at a major university. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't heavily recruited this year either. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks as if I will attend Los Angeles Community College in the fall, 
although I would really love to play at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal assistant coach, Curtis Townsend, phoned me to say that LACC Coach 
Mike Miller had spoken highly of my basketball abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Miller said I have "Big-Time" vision on the court as well as a great 
sense of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 My high school coach, Joe Reed, taught me that anything can happen if you 
believe. Coach Reed made me believe in myself, just like you did. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth grade, he told me hard work on the court pays off, just like at a 
job when a worker gets paid at the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Coach Reed, I wanted to be one of the best players in the City. And 
this year, it came true. 
</P>
<P>
 But not too many other things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 I work with Dad from 4 to 7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday and 10 to 6 p.m. on 
weekends at Dearden's Furniture store in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Frank, Frank Covarrubias, and my girlfriend, Nancy Vitela, an 
18-year-old East L.A. College student, went to most of my games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom, Martha Guerrero, always encouraged me to choose my basketball family over 
gang life. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't changed much either. 
</P>
<P>
 I go outside around 10 at night and dribble around the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the neighbors turn on their lights and the dogs bark, but most of 
them know it's me. Don't worry, if the barking gets louder, I dribble faster. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll bet you know where I will be next year. 
</P>
<P>
 You always had all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll tell you something I know: 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever I play, I plan on doing a lot of pointing.

ROAD BACK HAS POTHOLES FOR ONCE-IDYLLIC LAGUNA STREET; RECOVERY: A FEW PLAN TO 
REBUILD ON FIRE-RAVAGED BUENA VISTA WAY, BUT LANDSLIDE FEARS, RANCOR AND TIME 
TAKE A TOLL. 
</P>

<P>
 The sun slipped slowly into the Pacific as a loose knot of people stood in the 
middle of their desolate street last week, ticking off the names of the 
neighbors who once lived among them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carys? one asked. Gone. The Williamsons? History. Jim and Rob? Gone too. 
And so was Joe, who had decided a month or so back not to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just terrible," lamented Jackie Allen, standing on Buena Vista Way with 
her husband, Jim, and neighbor Thomas Homan. "Here we thought we'd have a real 
coming together after the fire, and I wanted to have this block party when we 
all got back in. But there won't be anybody left on the street to come to my 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after the October firestorm incinerated nine houses along this 
narrow, winding street, nearly half of those who lost homes here have chosen 
not to return. Their decisions to build or buy elsewhere ensure what once 
seemed only a disturbing possibility: in the wake of the fire, this one-block 
street on a hillside commanding a sweeping ocean view will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of at least four of the nine homeowners whose dwellings 
were destroyed by the wildfire -- including Don and Jo Williamson, who had 
lived here for 37 years -- the scope of the fire's impact on Buena Vista Way 
has struck home as never before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heartbreaking to see the neighbors go," said Sheila Patterson, who is 
planning to rebuild. "I really liked these people. I liked the age mix, I liked 
the different interests. I can't believe they're all going." 
</P>
<P>
 On a street where residents had long lived in contented isolation from one 
another, the wildfire had brought them together, forging new relationships as 
they struggled to rebound from the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for many, that newfound spirit of community will be dashed before it can 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just breaks my heart," Jackie Allen said. "Our street is just falling 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 The departures spell other changes for Buena Vista. Several of those who 
remain said they wonder whether the other lots, still dotted with blackened 
trees, may lie empty for a while. And they worry that their own property values 
may be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners' reasons for leaving vary, ranging from a reluctance to endure 
the inevitable headaches of rebuilding to concerns about reports that 
geologists have found possible signs of an ancient landslide under some lots in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said last week that the city has 
not received any written reports about the possibility of geological problems 
in the Buena Vista or Temple Hills area, although he said residents raised the 
issue at a recent City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are rumors of ancient landslides all over the city," Frank said. Even 
so, the percentage of Buena Vista residents who have chosen not to rebuild 
appears to be high when compared with the rest of the city, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors have intensified since the council's controversial decision two 
weeks ago to delay rebuilding for some property owners in the nearby Mystic 
Hills neighborhood while geologists try to determine whether an ancient slide 
lies beneath a number of lots there. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank said he did not doubt that geologists may have found such evidence under 
Buena Vista Way, but said the city could take no action without written 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamsons decided they can not wait, either for geologists to complete 
their tests or for the city to act. Based on preliminary advice from a 
geologist, Don, 80, and Jo, 78, made the wrenching decision to move from the 
neighborhood where they have lived for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of us feel a little like traitors to the street," admitted Don 
Williamson, standing on the lush new lot the couple has purchased in Bluebird 
Canyon. "We loved that area. I just have a very good feeling about this, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamsons' geologist, Fred Pratley, told them he had located disturbing, 
if preliminary, signs that an ancient slide might at least delay their plans to 
rebuild on Buena Vista, they said. The city requires geological studies before 
it will issue building permits. "We don't have that much time," said Jo 
Williamson, who held her husband's hand tightly as she walked slowly across the 
uneven ground of their new lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame the city and I don't blame the geologists," said her husband, 
an architect who already has designed their new house. "Jo and I, though, are 
at the age where we don't care to wait around." 
</P>
<P>
 Pratley, of Coastal Geotechnical of Laguna Beach, could not be reached for 
comment last week. But Allen Bell, another geologist working in the area, 
confirmed that his firm and others have found preliminary evidence that an 
ancient landslide may exist in the area. He stressed that the tests are 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, president of Petra Geotechnical of Costa Mesa, was reluctant to discuss 
specifics of the early findings, but said geologists and city officials are 
planning to meet soon, possibly this week, to decide on a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 He also emphasized that even if a slide is shown to exist under parts of Buena 
Vista and the street below, Temple Hills Drive, it does not necessarily mean 
that homes cannot be rebuilt in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "My advice (to residents) would be to stay calm and let the process work its 
way through," Bell said. "We're hopeful that it can be resolved without undue 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 A third company, Geofirm, which also consults for the city, found no problems 
in the studies it conducted for two residents of Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 But one year ago, just after a small landslide buckled the street, forcing the 
condemnation of two houses and the evacuation of two others, the company's 
geologists warned city officials that they believed an ancient landslide might 
exist in the area, said Hannes Richter, a geotechnical engineer and one of the 
company's principals. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of last year's landslide has not yet been determined and is the 
focus of litigation among some of the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Geofirm's own borings at that time did not locate a problem, Richter 
said, other data, including aerial photographs and information shared by other 
geologists, led the firm to suspect the existence of an ancient slide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Vista residents, several of whom learned only last week about the 
potential problems, said they could not help but worry about the possible 
impact on their hopes to rebuild their homes and neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first consequence is that everybody's ultimate dreams have been put on 
hold," said Christian Werner, who has lived on Buena Vista for 22 years and 
hopes to rebuild there. "The situation is somewhat unraveling." 
</P>
<P>
 Some families are going forward with rebuilding plans, however. The Allens are 
proceeding, armed with a geological report that will allow them to rebuild. So 
is Patterson. George Cary and Marlene Wright, who lived with their young 
daughter next door to the Allens, are not rebuilding, but said their decision 
had to do with their desire to provide a better play area for their daughter, 
Christina. Geologists with Geofirm have approved the lot for building, Cary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and his wife reached a settlement recently with their insurance 
company, which allowed them to look around at other property. They decided to 
buy a much larger, flatter lot at the top of a hillside across Park Avenue, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we were starting from scratch anyway, we felt we might as well see what 
the other opportunities were," Cary said. They have not yet decided whether to 
sell their Buena Vista property. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Homan, who has lived on the street since 1985, is among those planning 
to rebuild. In fact, the architectural plans for his new house are complete, he 
said, with a design review hearing set for later this month. Homan has not yet 
arranged for a geological study of his property but said he would do so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Homan and the Allens met on the street between their devastated 
lots one evening last week and tried to console themselves over the loss of so 
many neighbors. Laughing and lamenting by turns, the three joked about their 
new status as members of a dwindling group pushing ahead with rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the 10 little Indians," said Jim Allen, assuming an ominous tone. " 
'There were nine and then there were four.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Homan grinned. "Hey, sooner or later, God willing, all these lots will sell 
and nice people will move in and we'll be back in business, right?" he said, 
waving his arm down the barren street. "Then we'll just have to break them in." 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Edger, whose primary residence is in Illinois but who owned a house 
between Christian Werner and the Williamsons, said she is planning to rebuild 
"at this point." She said she worries, though, about the time commitment 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could just have my old house back, the way it was before the fire, I 
wouldn't have any question about it at all," she said. "But I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other households will not rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Becker, who spent almost $300,000 in 1991 remodeling his house, put his 
lot up for sale in February. Becker, who had rented the house to a series of 
tenants since the remodeling, said he was not interested in going through the 
construction process again. 
</P>
<P>
 And James Kelly and Robert Mangel, who had lived on the street for five years 
and whose Spanish-style house was the last to burn, decided to buy an existing, 
oceanfront home in Laguna's Woods Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said their reasons included fears that previous troubles with one 
neighbor might only be exacerbated by the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, though, "we just decided we wanted to get on with our lives," Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad for the street," Kelly added, speaking fondly of such neighbors as 
Julie Ireland, 74, whose home a couple doors down survived the fire, and the 
Williamsons, whose earlier plans to rebuild their Buena Vista house had 
represented "the hope of the street." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it was so great, these 80-year-olds going forward with 
rebuilding there," Kelly said. "I'll really miss them, but I'm so glad they're 
rebuilding elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamsons, whose giant, charred oak tree has become a symbol for 
residents of the street's rebirth since it sprouted leaves a few weeks ago, 
said that they have mixed feelings about their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But mainly, they said, they found themselves relieved when they closed escrow 
on the new lot -- ironically, on the same day their plans for rebuilding on 
Buena Vista were approved by the city, pending the geological report. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of last year's landslide, which forced them to evacuate their home, 
then the fire and lately, the geological worries, "the vibrations just seemed 
bad," said Don Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the couple has no plans to sell the lot, at least for now. In fact, they 
said, their son, who has always loved the property, may one day want to build 
on Buena Vista.

SCORING OF SCHOOL TESTS FOUND TO BE INACCURATE; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS CONCEDE 
USING TOO SMALL A SAMPLE FOR MANY GRADES. O.C. HAD SIX CASES WITH UNDER 25% 
TALLIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 State education officials broke their own rules in scoring California's new 
achievement tests, counting so few examinations that the scores for hundreds of 
schools may be wildly inaccurate and the results in half the cases are less 
precise than was promised, a Times computer analysis shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most extreme examples found in The Times study are a San Bernardino 
County middle school where only 1% of the math tests were counted, and two 
schools -- Vicentia Elementary in Corona and Columbia Elementary in Tuolumne 
County -- where results were based on exactly one student's work. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roosevelt Elementary in Indio, 169 students took the tests, but the state 
graded only four papers, then reported that everyone there scored at the lowest 
possible level, showing "little or no mathematical ability." 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept reading (the results) over and over again. . . . I kept trying to turn 
the bar graph upside-down. It really had me panicked," Principal Kennedy Rocker 
said. "It's not even a snapshot. It's a very blurry Polaroid with some Vaseline 
over the lens." 
</P>
<P>
 Short of time and money in the first year of the revolutionary California 
Learning Assessment System, which 1 million students took last spring at a cost 
of $15 million, education officials decided to score only a fraction of the 
tests at each school, promising that results would remain statistically sound. 
</P>
<P>
 But when told of The Times analysis, several independent statisticians agreed 
that although the scores in reading, writing and math may offer a general 
picture of California students as a whole, sampling error makes them too 
imprecise to be used for judging most districts or individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears they lost control," said Lee Crombach, a retired Stanford 
professor of education who has studied testing for 60 years. "(Sampling) is 
certainly something that can be managed, but in the first run it can go wrong, 
and it apparently went wrong here." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials acknowledged dozens of sampling problems with the scoring 
system, and said last week that reporting results on schools where the most 
extreme snafus occurred was a serious error. They said corrections and 
apologies would go out to some schools this month, while a new group of 
students takes the tests with a state promise that this time many more exams 
will be scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, education officials strongly defended CLAS, a new approach to testing 
that evaluates students' thought processes, as well as their ability to derive 
correct answers, and measures performance against tough statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're beginning a program as massive as this one, with limited funding, 
there have to be choices made," Acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. 
Dawson said. "The expectation is that it's going to be simple, it's going to be 
perfect and it's going to be painless the first time through. That's 
impossible. It's just an absolutely extraordinary accomplishment to have moved 
as far as we have as constructively as we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Results released last month to schools and the media painted a grim portrait 
of student achievement across California, with an especially woeful performance 
in math, where at least a third of the students statewide showed little or no 
understanding of basic concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 In their attempt to obtain valid samples from the 1993 tests, CLAS architects 
set some guidelines: At least 25% of the exams taken at every school were to be 
scored. The percentage varied by school but the state said the number should 
never fall below 44 tests for fourth grade, 70 for eighth grade and 80 for 
sophomores. At the smallest schools, all exams were to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, using the state's data, the Times analysis found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Overall, the guidelines were broken more than 11,000 times, meaning that in 
49.8% of the cases, individual school results were based on smaller samples 
than the state intended. In about half of those cases, the errors were minor, 
with samples falling one to five tests short of the guidelines. But in some 400 
instances, the samples were at least 15 tests off. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most serious errors, where fewer than 25% of tests were scored, occurred 
in 148 cases, mostly in elementary schools. In general, the sampling problems 
were the worst at elementary schools, where the guidelines were broken more 
often than they were followed. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the writing segment, more than 60% of the small schools did not have all 
their tests scored as the guidelines require. 
</P>
<P>
 * The ability of the samples to reflect a school's diversity also broke down 
when the smallest number of tests were counted. At one school where less than 
4% of the children have learning disabilities, for example, 40% of the tests 
scored belonged to those students, skewing the school's results. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Orange County, there were six cases where less than 25% of a school's 
tests were scored. Those and other less extreme sampling violations occurred in 
49% of the cases countywide; among fourth-graders, samples were too small 58% 
of the time, with guidelines broken in 75% of the schools on the writing 
segment and 72% in reading. At the 10th-grade level, math samples were too 
small in 61% of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles County, there were more than 50 cases -- most of them in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District -- of the extreme violation in which fewer 
than 25% of a school's tests were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, the overall sampling guidelines were violated in 53% of the 
cases. For fourth-graders, samples fell below the standard in 81% of the 
schools on the writing segment and 70% in reading. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials agree that it would be best to avoid sampling and have 
announced plans to count all tests and report individual results when the CLAS 
system -- which is expected to cost $55 million a year -- is fully in place: 
"Every student, every paper -- that's the plan," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS Director Dale Carlson said that since the 1993 results were released last 
month, the contractor that handled the scoring has discovered sampling errors 
at about 70 schools. But the Times analysis found that in at least twice that 
number of instances, not even the required minimum of 25% of tests were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that magnitude of sampling error directly spoiled the scores at only 
about 1% of the state's schools, the imprecise data was factored into district 
averages and other comparisons used for the 7,000 schools that took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a waste of money," said Barbara Anderson, principal of Santee 
Elementary in San Jose where 90 children took the tests but only nine or 10 
were scored in each subject. "It's a difficult test to give, it's a hard test 
for students, and you'd at least like to have some (accurate) results." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Carlson said, he wishes the state had not publicized data based 
on so few students' work in schools such as Anderson's. He called the situation 
very disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to think of anything that can go wrong that didn't go wrong this 
year," Carlson said. "A lot of mistakes were made on a lot of people's part -- 
most all of them were related to it being the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 The private firm hired to process the tests, CTB Macmillan/McGraw Hill, is 
trying to figure out how the errors occurred, Carlson said. So far, officials 
say the problems resulted from answer sheets getting lost at the contractor's 
office, arriving there defaced, or being split into groups that caused 
processors to believe that fewer students at certain schools took the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie Young, CLAS project director for the company, said the state Department 
of Education instructed her not to discuss the tests with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous standardized tests, which used multiple choice answers scored 
by a computer, the CLAS tests include essays, diagrams and explanations that 
must be judged by people. Last summer, about 2,000 public schoolteachers 
statewide were paid $100 a day to score a random sample of tests. Overall, 
48.7% of the state's tests were scored, and because most students took three 
tests, that left 1.5 million answer sheets untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Each graded test was evaluated against the tough new achievement standards and 
assigned a score of 1 to 6. Then every school, district and county in the state 
was told what percentage of their students scored at each level. 
</P>
<P>
 All test scores contain some degree of "standard error," a statistical term 
that measures the level of precision. CLAS results have higher standard error 
than previous tests because students are given a diverse set of problems and 
many of their answers are explanatory rather than absolute. 
</P>
<P>
 Small samples amplify standard error, in some cases raising it so high that 
the results have little meaning, said Gary Phillips, associate commissioner of 
the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to be giving a test that has high stakes . . . if it's going 
to affect the lives of the students, the schools and the state, then you want 
to have as low a standard error as possible," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Baker, a UCLA professor of education who runs the Center for Student 
Testing, Evaluation and Standards, cautioned people against choosing schools or 
changing curricula based on the test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people should be massively running around moving people about 
at this point," Baker said. "High-stakes decisions ought not to be made until 
they have the kinks worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though educators warn against it, the public typically uses standardized 
tests as a barometer for judging schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents carry lists of the scores, encouraging buyers to move into 
neighborhoods where the numbers are highest. With new state laws allowing open 
enrollment, public schools compete with one another for students, and many 
parents see CLAS as the simplest way to measure schools' success. 
</P>
<P>
 So to Steve Simpkins, principal at Canyon Hills Junior High in Chino, the CLAS 
results are "less than useless." 
</P>
<P>
 "When incorrect scores come out, people remember that first information," he 
said. "We're going to have to do damage control." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, the state's largest, included schools 
with some of the worst sampling mistakes: 51 schools where less than 25% of the 
tests were scored, 37 of them among fourth-graders, according to the Times 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the district, the guidelines were broken in some way more than 
1,100 times, or 61% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide at the eighth-grade level, more than half of the schools had fewer 
than half of their math tests scored. Similarly, fewer than half the sophomore 
math tests were scored at 49% of California's high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sampling problems were most widespread at the fourth-grade level, 
where thousands of schools -- 76% in writing, 65% in reading and 30% in math -- 
had fewer tests scored than promised by the state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those rules, any school with 49 students or less should have had 
all their tests scored. But the data shows that about 500 such schools, more 
than half of the total, did not have 100% counted in the writing or math 
sections. In reading, more than 400 of these small schools, 48% of the total, 
did not have 100% of their tests counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an unfortunate occurrence," said Dawson, the state's top education 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing, 43 schools had less than 25% of their tests scored, while in 
reading, there were 37 such schools. On the math tests, 21 schools had less 
than 25% of their tests scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Like about half a dozen other schools, Cahuenga Elementary in Los Angeles 
makes the list in all three categories. At Cahuenga, only eight of 95 papers 
were graded in each area, instead of 46, as the guidelines require. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work so hard. . . . Our test scores have always shown that we were above 
the state average," Cahuenga Principal Lloyd Houske said. "To drop to the 
lowest level -- it was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 At Lerdo Primary in Kern County, 106 students took the exams, but only 12 were 
scored in reading and 13 in writing (the sampling guidelines call for 46). At 
Muir Elementary in Fresno, only 25 of 151 writing papers were graded (it should 
have been 48). At Excelsior Elementary in Garden Grove, the math results are 
based on five of the 30 students tested (the guidelines require 30). 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you get for what you're paying?" asked Christine Olsen, spokeswoman 
for a Sacramento County district where five of 72 math tests were scored for 
one school. "There are a lot of things that are better about CLAS (than 
previous tests). . . . But (these results are) just flat not accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's scoring guidelines instructed that "the larger the school, the 
larger the number of students sampled," but in fact, some large schools had 
results based on tiny numbers of students. 
</P>
<P>
 About four dozen of the state's junior high and high schools had less than 25% 
of their tests counted, breaking the main sampling rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples: two of 350 math tests were scored at Terrace Hills Junior High 
in San Bernardino County, 14 of 360 tests at Sequoia Junior High in Simi 
Valley, 16 of 305 tests at Tetzlaff Junior High in Cerritos, 41 of 494 tests at 
Mar Vista Middle School in San Diego County and 74 of 590 tests at Portola 
Middle School in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous," said Rollin Grider, director of curriculum for the district 
that includes Terrace Hills. "These results are not valid. We can't draw any 
conclusions from (them). They told us they'd get us some new results, so we're 
waiting for those. And if they don't, we'll scream." 
</P>
<P>
 Another key question educators are asking is: Which students were counted? The 
state's sampling was done randomly to ward off bias, but some administrators 
say that in schools in which the samples were too small, the group often lacked 
diversity and did not reflect the student population. 
</P>
<P>
 Cahuenga Elementary's student body is one-third Asian American and two-thirds 
Latino, but the tests that were scored all belonged to students of Asian 
heritage, Houske said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was flipped at Santee Elementary in San Jose, where only nine or 
10 students were scored on each portion of the exam. Santee is 40% Asian 
American, but no Asian American students' tests were graded, according to the 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, four of the tests graded in each area belonged to students with 
learning disabilities, although only 3.8% of the students overall have such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't our population. The CLAS test is a better assessment tool than the 
former tests were, but they need to make sure there's enough time and energy 
and money to correct them and give them back to schools so they have correct 
information," Principal Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a nice feeling to know that the public is seeing information like 
this. They don't know what we know about it. They don't know it's inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Reilly is The Times' director of computer analysis. The story was written by 
Wilgoren. Small Samples 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education scored only a fraction of the California Learning 
Assessment System (CLAS) tests taken at each school last spring. To ensure 
statistical validity, there were sampling guidelines, including a promise not 
to base any school's scores on less than 25% of the tests taken there. But in 
148 instances -- about 1% in most testing areas -- schools got results based on 
less than 25% of the students tested. When no tests were scored, schools did 
not receive any results. Some examples:

GARAMENDI'S CAMPAIGN RUNNING ON LEAN FUNDING; POLITICS: ALTHOUGH HE LACKS 
KATHLEEN BROWN'S BASE, THE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IS NOT WITHOUT RESOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are lean days for John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner who is 
running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 What insiders call "smart money" has been going to Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
his main opponent in the Democratic primary. She had more than $3 million in 
mid-March. Garamendi had only $50,000 on hand and $450,000 of his total fund 
raising was from loans. 
</P>
<P>
 With the primary campaign in its final two months, Garamendi knows he will not 
match Brown's money. Garamendi's family, though wealthy, does not come with 
fund-raising connections. He does not attract big bucks from Hollywood, Wall 
Street or a nationwide network of politically active women. All have been fat 
sources of cash for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In politics, however, lean is relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he took office as insurance commissioner in 1991, Garamendi has raised 
$3.5 million. He used much of the money to pay off campaign debts. Now, he is 
spending it as fast as he raises it to air television spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he lacks Brown's fund-raising base, Garamendi is not without 
resources. He raised $340,000 from labor unions since last year. He also has 
tapped into several wealthy entrepreneurs who have given him more than 
$100,000, and he has the potential to raise much more. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Patty, have put their own considerable wealth behind their 
previous campaigns, although nothing yet to this one. Other Garamendi 
supporters have the capacity to dump huge sums into races. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Robert M. Bass, a billionaire from Ft. Worth, Tex. Bass and his 
associates have given Garamendi $54,000 since 1991. Garamendi had lunch with 
Bass during a fund-raising swing through Texas last week. The amount he came 
back with will not be known until he files his next campaign finance report. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hard-working, pragmatic and the kind of guy who is dedicated to economic 
growth in California. We've got business interests, so we're looking for that 
kind of leadership," said Owen Blicksilver, the Bass organization spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Some actions by a California governor could bear on the Bass group. The 
governor has five appointees to the Bay Conservation and Development 
Commission, which oversees development on the shores of San Francisco Bay. The 
Bass' California holdings include a stake in Pier 39, a tourist stop at 
Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. The partnership has been seeking approval 
from the bay commission to build an underwater aquarium at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, 49, took office as California's first elected insurance 
commissioner in 1991 and became among the most high-profile statewide officials 
with his news conferences attacking insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance commissioner oversees virtually every aspect of the insurance 
industry. He rules on requests for rate increases, seizes insolvent insurance 
companies, handles consumer complaints and cajoles insurers into granting 
rebates ordered by Proposition 103, the 1988 initiative that made the office of 
insurance commissioner elective. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi makes a point of refusing money from the industry he regulates, 
although given the contempt insurance companies have for him, they would be 
unlikely to donate much anyway. He has criticized Brown for taking more than 
$800,000 from investment houses, law firms and other corporations with which 
she does business as treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Garamendi refuses insurance company money, he has accepted more 
than $200,000 from other firms with which his Department of Insurance has 
dealt, a Times analysis of his campaign finances shows. They include law firms, 
investment houses, accountants and others over whom he had jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's typical John Garamendi. He says one thing and does another," said 
Michael Reese, spokesman for Brown. "That is inconsistent at best, hypocritical 
at worst." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said his policy is to turn down money from entities he regulates, 
but added: "The application is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know everyone with whom we may be doing business," said Garamendi, 
who agreed to an interview with The Times about his fund raising. "I don't 
manage the day-to-day (contribution) policy. It is the general policy, but I'm 
not going to say it is ironclad." 
</P>
<P>
 (Brown would not discuss her fund raising, referring questions about it to her 
campaign aides.) 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi recently strengthened the policy. He decided that he would no longer 
take money from one of his longtime benefactors, the San Francisco-based law 
firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Orrick and its lawyers have given Garamendi at least $33,500 since he took 
office, and $22,000 to Patty Garamendi during her unsuccessful runs for the 
Assembly in 1991 and Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Orrick, Herrington has represented the Department of Insurance in 
litigation involving the seizure of First Capital Life Insurance Co. Orrick has 
received $8.7 million in fees for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want the hassle, the questions," Garamendi said, explaining why he 
will no longer take Orrick money. 
</P>
<P>
 Orrick lawyers say there is no connection between their donations and the 
work. The firm and its lawyers have given more than $50,000 to Brown, who also 
has hired the firm to do bond work. 
</P>
<P>
 As California state treasurer, Brown oversees billions of dollars in state 
money. She hires investment houses and outside attorneys to sell state bonds 
and manage state money. 
</P>
<P>
 As insurance commissioner, Garamendi's portfolio is more modest. Still, it 
amounts to $242 million, which comes from assets of insolvent insurance firms 
seized by the Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi divides his portfolio among five investment houses, which must bid 
for the business. One is Wertheim, Schroeder & Co. The New York firm manages 
$56 million in insurance department money. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheim, Schroeder has given Garamendi $11,000 in campaign contributions 
since 1992, the year after it began managing insurance department money. One of 
the firm's partners is former California Rep. Tony Coelho, whose former San 
Joaquin Valley district overlapped Garamendi's when Garamendi was a state 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Coelho, who resigned from Congress and relocated to Wall Street in 1989, said 
he and Garamendi have been "good friends politically for a long time." When 
Garamendi appeared in New York at a fund-raiser last April, the former 
congressman was among the hosts. Garamendi has raised more than $100,000 from 
his East Coast fund raising, but Coelho takes little credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't twist any arms," said Coelho, who was a prodigious fund-raiser when 
he was in Congress. "He didn't want me to beat the bushes for him because we 
are a manager of money of his. He doesn't want the appearance of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's ability to raise money in his race for governor is intertwined in 
other ways with his work as insurance commissioner. His donors include business 
people and activists who laud his work as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has worked and delivered and been there for the AIDS community," said 
David Mixner, a gay businessman and influential Democratic activist from West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixner, who has given Garamendi at least $1,000 and is trying to raise more, 
credited Garamendi for being the nation's first insurance commissioner to set 
up a task force that focuses on AIDS-related insurance issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has received $200,000 from physicians and the health care industry 
since 1991. He and his doctor-donors say the money is a tribute to his plans 
for health care reform. Reese, Brown's spokesman, says that they give because 
they depend on insurance for payment and Garamendi oversees insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was as insurance commissioner that Garamendi met one of his biggest 
benefactors, Maurice Marciano, chairman of Guess? Inc. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Marciano was distressed at the runaway cost of workers' compensation. 
Concluding that he was a victim of fraudulent claims by some employees, 
Marciano met with Garamendi in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who has authority to investigate workers' compensation fraud, 
formed an anti-fraud unit. Now, Marciano said, his workers' compensation costs 
have been cut by half, and he gives Garamendi much of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed us he could do something, he could achieve something," Marciano 
said. "He understood there was a problem and he really went after it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marciano has shown his appreciation. Since 1991, Guess? has donated $95,000 to 
Garamendi. When Garamendi asked for more money last year, Marciano wrote out a 
check for $50,000. It is a loan. If he loses the primary, Garamendi must repay 
it. If he wins the primary, Marciano said, he will convert it to a donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Marciano said he is not looking for favors from the next governor. He said the 
biggest issue is crime and he is convinced that Garamendi is the candidate who 
could do the most to make neighborhoods safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess? also has issues pending before the labor commissioner, an appointee of 
the governor, over alleged violations of wage and labor laws by its 
subcontractors. Labor inspectors recently seized a load of jeans because of 
problems with a subcontractor. Marciano said such actions, coupled with 
worsening crime, have prompted him to consider moving his operation from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mathematics of political fund raising, contributions tend to follow a 
candidate's standing in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say that if the race begins to close, I'll give (Garamendi) 
some money," said San Francisco lawyer Duane Garrett, a Democratic activist and 
a radio talk show host who supports Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap between Brown and Garamendi remains wide. Garamendi trailed Brown, 39% 
to 25% in the most recent Times poll. In his private fund-raising pitches, 
Garamendi talks about other polls that show he would fare better than Brown 
against incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson -- though both Democrats lead Wilson, polls 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitch appealed to Democratic donor Herbert Hafif of Claremont, but not at 
first. When Garamendi first called last year, Hafif was blunt: "You're wasting 
your time, and I don't think you're eloquent enough to change me." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hafif said, Garamendi "hounded" him until he agreed to meet for dinner. 
The meal was supposed to last an hour. Hafif, an attorney and property manager, 
stayed until 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that Garamendi would be a terrific governor, Hafif decided to "send 
a message" to other would-be donors. The code was fairly simple: a dollar sign 
followed by six digits. He lent Garamendi $200,000. Hafif said he is uncertain 
whether he will forgive the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I size up jurors and witnesses all the time. He has credibility. He can do 
it," said Hafif, who once ran for governor as a Democrat against Brown's 
brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown. "Ideals without moxie just makes bad 
plumbing. Here's a guy who wants to do it and has the moxie." 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two months before the June primary, Garamendi is running hard, 
volunteering at various jobs around the state for publicity and raising money 
full time. His aides say he needs another $2 million to $3 million to win -- 
roughly $50,000 a day until June 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi -- taking a cue from state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who is 
seeking the nomination on a platform of political reform -- vows to make 
campaign finance reform a "big-time priority" if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system has got to change," Garamendi said. "How many articles do the 
newspapers need to write? It is a bankrupt system and it has got to change."

DEATH UNDERSCORES YOUTH OFFICERS' PERIL; LAW ENFORCEMENT: UNARMED PROBATION 
WORKERS RELY MOSTLY ON GUILE TO HANDLE INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS JUVENILE 
OFFENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is a thankless and often perilous job, one that Arnold Garcia performed 
without the benefit of a gun, baton, chemical spray or personal alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, he worked the graveyard shift at the Dorothy F. Kirby 
Center in the City of Commerce, supervising the locked cottages that house some 
of Los Angeles County's most youthful and troubled offenders. Like all of the 
Probation Department's 3,000 employees, he got by with only two weapons -- 
muscle and guile. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, something changed about the teen-agers who ran afoul of 
the law. They became less respectful, more menacing -- not merely wayward 
youths but often hardened veterans of Southern California's bloody gang wars. 
One of them, bent on escape, allegedly clubbed Garcia to death last week with a 
metal leg from a desk. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the 58-year-old East Los Angeles resident was buried in a 
mahogany coffin under a bed of white carnations, the first Probation Department 
employee killed in the line of duty since the agency was formed in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
 His family remembered him as a devoted husband and father of nine who 
dedicated himself to his delinquent wards as if they were his own blood. But, 
to many of his co-workers who operate the county's three juvenile halls and 20 
probation camps, he also was a symbol of their increasingly hazardous mission 
-- one they are expected to perform without any of the protective equipment 
issued by other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "By wits, cunning, personality and, occasionally, force, we have been able to 
keep a lid on things," said Mary Ridgeway, a veteran Eastside probation 
officer. "But this isn't the 1950s anymore. If a major incident breaks out, our 
people have nothing except themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kirby Center, where Garcia worked as a group supervisor for 17 years, was 
considered among the county's least-volatile facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1961 as a home for troubled girls, it eventually became a co-ed 
treatment center with a sterling reputation for offering psychological therapy 
to the emotionally disturbed. With 13-foot walls designed to blend into the 
landscape, it resembles a well-kept prep school. In its confines, about 100 
teen-agers complete eight-month stays. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he left for work, he would say: 'I've got to go take care of my kids,' " 
said Garcia's son, 35-year-old Arnold III. "He tried to make them feel like he 
was their father." 
</P>
<P>
 During his all-night shift from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., Garcia often bent the 
rules, bringing candy and videos for the most well-behaved wards. Always, 
co-workers said, he had his Bible in hand, passing the lonely hours by praying 
for those who had strayed. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 a.m. last Monday, he heard a knock from inside one of the bedroom 
doors. A teen-ager, who authorities said was serving time for burglary and 
possession of a concealed weapon, asked if he could be let out to use the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Garcia unlocked the door, he was whacked in the head with a metal 
object, apparently a leg from a desk that had been disassembled in the room. 
The alleged assailant then fled with another teen-ager, but the two boys, ages 
16 and 17, were captured a short time later at a nearby railroad yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so vulnerable here," said one of Garcia's colleagues, who asked not to 
be identified because the staff has been instructed not to discuss the 
incident. "I used to look at these as just troubled kids . . . but now it's 
like, just give me a baton and Mace." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers at the California Youth Authority are given chemical spray and, in 
some cases, batons. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles County Jail, deputies are armed with pepper spray, flashlights 
and radios. Should a riot break out, a tactical squad in riot gear arrives with 
stinger grenades that explode into hundreds of hard rubber pellets. 
</P>
<P>
 At state prisons, correctional officers carry batons and personal alarms. In a 
disturbance, they have observation posts equipped with 37-millimeter cannons 
that fire wood blocks known as "knee-knockers." 
</P>
<P>
 But under Probation Department guidelines, officers are pretty much on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was allowed to have handcuffs, his co-workers say, but he would have 
been required to leave them in his desk drawer. An alarm is installed there 
too, but that assumes he would have had time to go back to his office. There is 
even an intercom device that picked up the sounds of the attack, the co-workers 
added, but it is so antiquated that officials could not immediately determine 
from which of the 10 cottages the noise had come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't control the place anymore," said a guard at Central Juvenile Hall 
who once had to break up a melee by spraying a group of youths with a fire 
extinguisher. "I hate to say it, but these kids could get away with almost 
anything they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is partly one of shrinking government resources, a trend that has 
forced deep cuts in a department widely viewed as the justice system's 
forgotten stepchild. Although agency guidelines recommend one guard for every 
10 juveniles in custody, Kirby Center employees say that Garcia was alone 
watching over a 20-bed cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond economics, however, lies a philosophical crossroads for the department. 
Historically, its officers have been asked to meld social work into their 
watchdog responsibilities. By counseling youths and setting expectations, they 
usually can deliver strict discipline without resorting to force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe our brain is our best weapon," said Craig Levy, the department's 
media relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, the dynamics of these juvenile facilities have been 
undergoing a dramatic conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang rivalries and racial tensions, long the purview of county jails and state 
prisons, have started to polarize the 40,000 teen-agers who pass through the 
Probation Department's system each year. Although some of the youths are car 
thieves and vandals, others are likely to be awaiting trial for murder, rape or 
a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them minors, but they're just as dangerous and volatile -- if not 
more so -- than some of the felons you have in maximum-security prisons," said 
Richard Shumsky, president of Local 685, the probation officers' union. "The 
department has learned a very difficult lesson at the expense of one of our 
colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
 After Garcia's death, Shumsky met with Probation Department supervisors and 
complained about the lack of security. Among the union's demands: pepper spray 
and personal alarms, which can be clipped to a belt and triggered at a second's 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't intend to trade in our brains and our compassion," Shumsky said, 
"but we also don't want our people battered or killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Probation Officer Barry J. Nidorf, who on Saturday presented Garcia's 
widow with an American flag that had been draped over Garcia's casket, conceded 
that his deputies are being asked to supervise a very different generation of 
teen-agers without any change in equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nidorf, who has not made a decision on the union's demands, also said he 
was concerned that such protective devices could lull officers into a false 
state of security. "If you begin to rely on Mace or pepper spray to maintain 
control in an institution, in many ways you lose control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's impossible to say whether any protective equipment would have 
made a difference in Garcia's case. By all appearances, co-workers lamented, 
Garcia never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mass was said at St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, some speculated that 
Garcia may have become too trusting after so many years, especially working at 
a facility that emphasizes therapy, not punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved those kids," said one Kirby co-worker, "even the baddest ones who 
always cursed him out."

U.S., UKRAINE IN ACCORD TO SHUT CHERNOBYL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chernobyl nuclear reactor plant, site of the world's worst nuclear 
accident and still a major source of electric power, will cease operations 
under an agreement struck between the United States and Ukraine, U.S. officials 
announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Energy Secretary Bill White told reporters that a delegation from the 
U.S. Department of Energy, working with Ukrainian officials over the course of 
several days, secured a "commitment in principle" to shut down Chernobyl's two 
remaining nuclear reactors "at the earliest possible date." 
</P>
<P>
 The closure would follow a U.S.-Ukrainian study of options for replacing the 
lost energy. American officials said that energy conservation and more 
efficient technologies, including cleaner, coal-burning power-plant designs, 
could more than make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "This public statement puts Ukraine unalterably on the path to a shutdown," 
White said in Washington within an hour of his return from Kiev, Ukraine's 
capital. He called the decision "courageous and creative." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that previous efforts to close the plant had failed, White 
expressed confidence that the combination of Western technical assistance and 
Ukraine's changing political climate would allow Ukrainian officials to follow 
through on the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two governments left unresolved significant differences over how 
quickly the Chernobyl plant should be shuttered. White declared flatly that the 
reactors should halt operations no later than mid-June, when the joint study is 
expected to be complete. His Ukrainian counterpart, Vice Prime Minister Valery 
Shmarov, has argued that the plants could not be decommissioned until 
alternative sources of energy are secured -- no sooner than 1998 or 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting timetables suggest that Ukraine, which bargained hard before 
recently giving up Soviet-era nuclear weapons on its soil, may seek more 
concessions or guarantees from the West before it shuts down the reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chernobyl power station seized the world's attention in April, 1986, when 
an explosion in one of its four reactors sent clouds of radioactive dust 
spreading across Eastern Europe and Scandinavia and much of the former Soviet 
Union. Although the death toll at the time was officially put at 32, Ukrainian 
authorities have since claimed that up to 8,000 people subsequently died from 
illnesses brought on by the explosion and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 The inoperative reactor involved in the incident remains entombed in a leaky 
casement of sand and concrete. But two other reactors in the complex -- No. 1 
and No. 3 -- continue to generate electricity. Ukraine, seeking reliable 
sources for additional energy, had planned to repair and recommission the 
remaining reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 White said that Washington will provide technical assistance and funds for the 
shutdown through the World Bank and the European Development Bank. The Clinton 
Administration plans to explore whether a pool of funds earmarked by Congress 
to help the former Soviet republics retire their nuclear weapons could be used 
to help take the Chernobyl plant out of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 If implemented, the agreement could mark the end of a long and frustrating 
effort by much of the world community to persuade the Soviet Union -- and, 
later, independent Ukraine -- to decommission the reactors, which sit in an 
eerie, depopulated wasteland north of Kiev. No one except the plant's 4,500 
employees is allowed to travel within roughly 20 miles of the blown-out 
radioactive core of Reactor No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the shutdown would mark the end of operations for a pair of 
reactors that are among the world's most dangerous and unstable. The 
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. body that monitors the 
safety and security of nuclear materials worldwide, concluded in late March 
that "numerous safety deficiencies" remain at the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station. It suggested that the entombed reactor involved in the 1986 accident 
could collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an event "would have serious consequences," the IAEA noted. And White 
predicted that it would create a significant obstacle to the orderly shutdown 
of the remaining reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 White told reporters that a visit to the plant provided unsettling indications 
of the continuing hazard involved in operating the Chernobyl reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 The average age of plant employees is under 30, and there have been two full 
turnovers of personnel there, leaving relatively inexperienced workers to 
manage any emergency. Hallways were lined with flammable plastic material, and 
White said he saw one plant operator light a cigarette in a control area. 
Smoking would be strictly forbidden in such an area within a U.S. nuclear 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ukrainians have argued that the reactors must be permitted to continue 
operations or the country's beleaguered economy will founder further. In 
December, as Ukraine faced a harsh winter and had no hard currency to pay 
Russia for oil and gas to run its factories, a decision to close the power 
station was canceled by the Ukrainian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two operational reactors at Chernobyl supply roughly 7% of Ukraine's 
electricity needs, the cost of operating them has been an onerous burden for 
the cash-strapped government. Continuing cleanup efforts and public-health 
programs designed to treat victims of the disaster consume 12% of the former 
Soviet republic's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 White said conservation measures in a country that uses energy as 
inefficiently as Ukraine could be applied easily and quickly. He added that the 
recent Russian decision to accept barter, rather than hard currency, for its 
oil and gas would make it easier for Ukraine to find alternative energy 
supplies beyond its border.

 LONG ABSENTEES: They'll be going to the polls in Irvine on April 26, but it 
takes exclusive qualifications to vote in this election. South Africa will let 
its citizens living in the U.S. vote in its intense general election that day. 
Irvine City Hall was selected locally for its centralized location. . . . The 
county's South African population numbers about 3,000. Says one Irvine South 
African: "Everybody I know plans to be there. We're quite excited."

 YOUNG & ITALIAN: If you're at Carmelo's Ristorante in Corona del Mar this 
afternoon, you'll get a surprise at how young the waiters are. And the 
hostesses. And the cooks. . . . They're all from nearby Corona del Mar High 
School, and owner Carmelo Manto will turn his dining room over to them. Manto 
says it's so "the youngsters can do something fun and get a 
behind-the-scenes-look at the restaurant business." The students see another 
bonus: The school gets to keep the profits from its two-hour stint. 
</P>
<P>
 IMAGINE TIME: If you think art means anything from finger painting to full 
orchestration, the county's Department of Education and the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center say they've got the thing for you. They call it 
Imagination Celebration. It starts Saturday. After that it runs April 23-May 1, 
nearly 40 art-related events countywide. . . . You'll see a lot of the poster 
by Heather Wilson, 17, of El Modena High, who won its contest with her idea 
that imagination is a world where "animals can fly a plane." 
</P>
<P>
 STARTING EARLY: Would you go to a college student to help you with something 
as complicated as exports or real estate? Liang Meng, 21, a Chapman University 
senior, isn't your average student. A straight A scholar, he's built an 
impressive list of clients who pay for his investment advice -- including some 
of the university's own trustees. The past week he was named Chapman's 
outstanding business and economics student. Says Meng, a native of Shanghai: 
"The faculty here really pays attention to the students."

SCORING OF SCHOOL TESTS FOUND TO BE INACCURATE; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS CONCEDE 
THEY USED ONLY A HANDFUL OF TESTS TO RANK SOME CAMPUSES IN STATEWIDE EXAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 State education officials broke their own rules in scoring California's new 
achievement tests, counting so few examinations that the scores for hundreds of 
schools may be wildly inaccurate and the results in half the cases are less 
precise than was promised, a Times computer analysis shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most extreme examples found in the Times study are a San Bernardino 
County middle school where only 1% of the math tests were counted, and two 
schools -- Vicentia Elementary in Corona and Columbia Elementary in Tuolumne 
County -- where results were based on exactly one student's work. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roosevelt Elementary in Indio, 169 students took the tests, but the state 
graded only four papers, then reported that everyone there scored at the lowest 
possible level, showing "little or no mathematical ability." 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept reading (the results) over and over again. . . . I kept trying to turn 
the bar graph upside-down. It really had me panicked," Principal Kennedy Rocker 
said. "It's not even a snapshot. It's a very blurry Polaroid with some Vaseline 
over the lens." 
</P>
<P>
 Short of time and money in the first year of the revolutionary California 
Learning Assessment System, which 1 million students took last spring at a cost 
of $15 million, education officials decided to score only a fraction of the 
tests at each school, promising that results would remain statistically sound. 
</P>
<P>
 But when told of The Times analysis, several independent statisticians agreed 
that although the scores in reading, writing and math may offer a general 
picture of California students as a whole, sampling error makes them too 
imprecise to be used for judging most districts or individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears they lost control," said Lee Crombach, a retired Stanford 
professor of education who has studied testing for 60 years. "(Sampling) is 
certainly something that can be managed, but in the first run it can go wrong, 
and it apparently went wrong here." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials acknowledged dozens of sampling problems with the scoring 
system, and said last week that reporting results on schools where the most 
extreme snafus occurred was a serious error. They said corrections and 
apologies would go out to some schools this month, while a new group of 
students takes the tests with a state promise that this time many more exams 
will be scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, education officials strongly defended CLAS, a new approach to testing 
that evaluates students' thought processes, as well as their ability to derive 
correct answers, and measures performance against tough statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're beginning a program as massive as this one, with limited funding, 
there have to be choices made," Acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. 
Dawson said. "The expectation is that it's going to be simple, it's going to be 
perfect and it's going to be painless the first time through. That's 
impossible. It's just an absolutely extraordinary accomplishment to have moved 
as far as we have as constructively as we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Results released last month to schools and the media painted a grim portrait 
of student achievement across California, with an especially woeful performance 
in math, where at least a third of the students statewide showed little or no 
understanding of basic concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 In their attempt to obtain valid samples from the 1993 tests, CLAS architects 
set some guidelines: At least 25% of the exams taken at every school were to be 
scored. The percentage varied by school but the state said the number should 
never fall below 44 tests for fourth grade, 70 for eighth grade and 80 for 
sophomores. At the smallest schools, all exams were to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, using the state's data, the Times analysis found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Overall, the guidelines were broken more than 11,000 times, meaning that in 
49.8% of the cases, individual school results were based on smaller samples 
than the state intended. In about half of those cases, errors were minor, with 
samples falling one to five tests short of the guidelines. But in about 400 
instances, samples were at least 15 tests off. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most serious errors, where fewer than 25% of tests were scored, occurred 
in 148 cases, mostly in elementary schools. In general, the sampling problems 
were the worst at elementary schools, where the guidelines were broken more 
often than they were followed. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the writing segment, more than 60% of the small schools did not have all 
their tests scored as the guidelines require. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles County, there were more than 50 cases -- most of them in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District -- of the extreme violation in which fewer 
than 25% of a school's tests were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, the overall sampling guidelines were violated in 53% of the 
cases. For fourth-graders, samples fell below the standard in 81% of the 
schools on the writing segment and 70% in reading. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials agree that it would be best to avoid sampling and have 
announced plans to count all tests and report individual results when the CLAS 
system -- which is expected to cost $55 million a year -- is fully in place: 
"Every student, every paper, that's the plan," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS Director Dale Carlson said that since the 1993 results were released last 
month, the contractor that handled the scoring has discovered sampling errors 
at about 70 schools. But the Times analysis found that in at least twice that 
number of instances, not even the required minimum of 25% of tests were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that magnitude of sampling error directly spoiled the scores at only 
about 1% of the state's schools, the imprecise data was factored into district 
averages and other comparisons used for the 7,000 schools that took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a waste of money," said Barbara Anderson, principal of Santee 
Elementary in San Jose where 90 children took the tests but only nine or 10 
were scored in each subject. "It's a difficult test to give, it's a hard test 
for students, and you'd at least like to have some (accurate) results." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Carlson said, he wishes the state had not publicized data based 
on so few students' work in schools such as Anderson's. He called the situation 
very disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to think of anything that can go wrong that didn't go wrong this 
year," Carlson said. "A lot of mistakes were made on a lot of people's part -- 
most all of them were related to it being the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 The private firm hired to process the tests, CTB Macmillan/McGraw Hill, is 
trying to figure out how the errors occurred, Carlson said. So far, officials 
say the problems resulted from answer sheets getting lost at the contractor's 
office, arriving there defaced, or being split into groups that caused 
processors to believe that fewer students at certain schools took the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie Young, CLAS project director for the company, said the state Department 
of Education instructed her not to discuss the tests with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous standardized tests, which used multiple choice answers scored 
by a computer, the CLAS tests include essays, diagrams and explanations that 
must be judged by people. Last summer, about 2,000 public schoolteachers 
statewide were paid $100 a day to score a random sample of tests. Overall, 
48.7% of the state's tests were scored, and because most students took three 
tests, that left 1.5 million answer sheets untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Each graded test was evaluated against the tough new achievement standards and 
assigned a score of 1 to 6. Then every school, district and county in the state 
was told what percentage of their students scored at each level. 
</P>
<P>
 All test scores contain some degree of "standard error," a statistical term 
that measures the level of precision. CLAS results have higher standard error 
than previous tests because students are given a diverse set of problems and 
many of their answers are explanatory rather than absolute. 
</P>
<P>
 Small samples amplify standard error, in some cases raising it so high that 
the results have little meaning, said Gary Phillips, associate commissioner of 
the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to be giving a test that has high stakes . . . if it's going 
to affect the lives of the students, the schools and the state, then you want 
to have as low a standard error as possible," Phillips said.

 Eva Baker, a UCLA professor of education who runs the Center for Student 
Testing, Evaluation and Standards, cautioned people against choosing schools or 
changing curricula based on the test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people should be massively running around moving people about 
at this point," Baker said. "High-stakes decisions ought not to be made until 
they have the kinks worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though educators warn against it, the public typically uses standardized 
tests as a barometer for judging schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents carry lists of the scores, encouraging buyers to move into 
neighborhoods where the numbers are highest. With new state laws allowing open 
enrollment, public schools compete with one another for students, and many 
parents see CLAS as the simplest way to measure schools' success. 
</P>
<P>
 So to Steve Simpkins, principal at Canyon Hills Junior High in Chino, the CLAS 
results are "less than useless." 
</P>
<P>
 "When incorrect scores come out, people remember that first information," he 
said. "We're going to have to do damage control." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, the state's largest, included schools 
with some of the worst sampling mistakes: 51 schools where less than 25% of the 
tests were scored, 37 of them among fourth-graders, according to the Times 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the district, the guidelines were broken in some way more than 
1,100 times, or 61% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide at the eighth-grade level, more than half of the schools had fewer 
than half of their math tests scored. Similarly, fewer than half the sophomore 
math tests were scored at 49% of California's high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sampling problems were most widespread at the fourth-grade level, 
where thousands of schools -- 76% in writing, 65% in reading and 30% in math -- 
had fewer tests scored than promised by the state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those rules, any school with 49 students or less should have had 
all their tests scored. But the data shows that about 500 such schools, more 
than half of the total, did not have 100% counted in the writing or math 
sections. In reading, more than 400 of these small schools, 48% of the total, 
did not have 100% of their tests counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an unfortunate occurrence," said Dawson, the state's top education 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing, 43 schools had less than 25% of their tests scored, while in 
reading, there were 37 such schools. On the math tests, 21 schools had less 
than 25% of their tests scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Like about half a dozen other schools, Cahuenga Elementary in Los Angeles 
makes the list in all three categories. At Cahuenga, only eight of 95 papers 
were graded in each area, instead of 46, as the guidelines require. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work so hard. . . . Our test scores have always shown that we were above 
the state average," Cahuenga Principal Lloyd Houske said. "To drop to the 
lowest level -- it was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 At Lerdo Primary in Kern County, 106 students took the exams, but only 12 were 
scored in reading and 13 in writing (the sampling guidelines call for 46). At 
Muir Elementary in Fresno, only 25 of 151 writing papers were graded (it should 
have been 48). At Excelsior Elementary in Garden Grove, the math results are 
based on five of the 30 students tested (the guidelines require 30). 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you get for what you're paying?" asked Christine Olsen, spokeswoman 
for a Sacramento County district where five of 72 math tests were scored for 
one school. "There are a lot of things that are better about CLAS (than 
previous tests). . . . But (these results are) just flat not accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's scoring guidelines instructed that "the larger the school, the 
larger the number of students sampled," but in fact, some large schools had 
results based on tiny numbers of students. 
</P>
<P>
 About four dozen of the state's junior high and high schools had less than 25% 
of their tests counted, breaking the main sampling rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples: two of 350 math tests were scored at Terrace Hills Junior High 
in San Bernardino County, 14 of 360 tests at Sequoia Junior High in Simi 
Valley, 16 of 305 tests at Tetzlaff Junior High in Cerritos, 41 of 494 tests at 
Mar Vista Middle School in San Diego County and 74 of 590 tests at Portola 
Middle School in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous," said Rollin Grider, director of curriculum for the district 
that includes Terrace Hills. "These results are not valid. We can't draw any 
conclusions from (them). They told us they'd get us some new results, so we're 
waiting for those. And if they don't, we'll scream." 
</P>
<P>
 Another key question educators are asking is: Which students were counted? The 
state's sampling was done randomly to ward off bias, but some administrators 
say that in schools in which the samples were too small, the group often lacked 
diversity and did not reflect the student population. 
</P>
<P>
 Cahuenga Elementary's student body is one-third Asian American and two-thirds 
Latino, but the tests that were scored all belonged to students of Asian 
heritage, Houske said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was flipped at Santee Elementary in San Jose, where only nine or 
10 students were scored on each portion of the exam. Santee is 40% Asian 
American, but no Asian American students' tests were graded, according to the 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, four of the tests graded in each area belonged to students with 
learning disabilities, although only 3.8% of the students overall have such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't our population. The CLAS test is a better assessment tool than the 
former tests were, but they need to make sure there's enough time and energy 
and money to correct them and give them back to schools so they have correct 
information," Principal Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a nice feeling to know that the public is seeing information like 
this. They don't know what we know about it. They don't know it's inaccurate." 
</P>

Wilgoren. Widespread Under-Sampling 
</P>
<P>
 State guidelines for scoring CLAS tests at individual schools were violated 
49.8% of the time, although in most cases samples were only a few tests short. 
Here are the percentages of schools in which samples were smaller than planned:

MARINES ON ALERT AS AMERICANS FLEE RWANDA FIGHTING; CENTRAL AFRICA: ABOUT 300 
U.S. TROOPS MUSTER IN NEIGHBORING BURUNDI, WHILE REBELS CLAIM TO BE WITHIN 10 
MILES OF CAPITAL. CLINTON DEPLORES 'TRAGIC SITUATION.'

<P>
 Under cover of darkness, Americans fled escalating warfare in Rwanda by convoy 
late Saturday, a senior U.S. official said, while hundreds of U.S. Marines 
gathered in neighboring Burundi to help rescue foreigners from the ethnic 
bloodletting and civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 With a cease-fire between Rwanda's rival Tutsi and Hutus quickly falling 
apart, President Clinton expressed concern about the "tragic situation" and 
about the safety of the approximately 250 U.S. citizens in the small Central 
African nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels belonging to the Tutsi-aligned Rwandan Patriotic Front undertook an 
offensive north of Kigali, the capital city, the Reuters news agency reported. 
Fighting involving heavy artillery was said to be raging along a hilly region 
best known as one of the last homes of the rare mountain gorilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels claimed to have advanced to within 10 miles of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Americans and other foreigners were moving south "on anything with 
four wheels that moves," a senior U.S. official said. Their destination was 
approximately 100 miles away in Bujumbura, the capital of neighboring Burundi, 
and the Associated Press reported that about 300 of the refugees -- American 
and European -- arrived there safely late Saturday and early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other convoys of Americans spent the night at a Danish mission station at 
the border between the two countries, U.S. military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape route through the southern part of Rwanda is relatively stable. 
U.S. officials said 170 Americans had left the capital and that 85 were still 
in Rwanda as of late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 300 U.S. Marines were sent to Burundi on Saturday, "basically there to 
assist if anything starts to go wrong," the senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines were dispatched from U.S. warships in the Indian Ocean off 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Marines, the Defense Department said that three huge CH-53 
transport helicopters had been flown to Bujumbura along with four KC-130 tanker 
planes, which can be used as transports, and that four C-141 jet transports 
were sent to Mombasa, Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 If needed, the troops could aid in mass evacuations -- possibly today -- of 
about 1,500 Belgian, 600 French and the remaining 85 U.S. citizens in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation in Rwanda remains tense, and a sharp escalation of fighting has 
been reported in the capital city," State Department spokesman Mike McCurry 
said Saturday. "The United States is taking steps to evacuate Americans from 
Rwanda, with the cooperation of local authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda, roughly the size of Maryland, is one of the poorest nations in Africa. 
It has been convulsed by violence since its president, Juvenal Habyarimana, and 
the president of Burundi, Cyprian Ntayamira, were killed late Wednesday when 
the airplane in which they were flying crashed as it approached the Kigali 
airport. The government said the plane was brought down by rocket fire from 
unidentified forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders, both Hutus, were returning from a regional summit in Tanzania 
intended to end years of violent spasms that have taken the lives of tens of 
thousands of the majority Hutus and minority Tutsi. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium said it had sent elite paratroop units to Rwanda, its former colony, 
and French troops were said to have taken up positions in central Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 There were conflicting reports about whether the contingent of about 300 
French paratroopers had succeeded in securing the airport. Col. Luc Marchal, 
commander of Belgian forces serving with a U.N. peacekeeping unit, said Rwandan 
government forces opposed to the international effort later blocked the runway 
with firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Paris, the Foreign Ministry said that French troops had evacuated 43 
nationals by air and that other rescue flights are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Pierre Harze, a spokesman in Paris for the humanitarian organization 
Doctors Without Borders, said the wounded and the dead in Rwanda's capital "can 
be counted by the thousands." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a huge number of bodies in the street," he told the Associated 
Press, relaying a report from staff members in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian television, which has two correspondents in Rwanda, carried several 
eyewitness reports Saturday that provided a picture of mounting confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In one account from Kigali's main hospital, medical coordinator Fabienne 
Dorlencourt described scenes of horror. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen about 150 bodies here, but the real figure (for the area around the 
hospital) is likely to be 300 to 400," she said. "The wounded seem to have been 
injured mainly by machete and grenade attacks. It's total anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners were ordered to dig mass graves for the victims, Radio France 
Internationale reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats were trying to reach all foreigners by radio to urge those 
willing to risk an overland journey to make their escape. U.S. personnel and 
their dependents -- roughly half the Americans in Rwanda -- were ordered to 
leave. Missionaries make up most of the rest of the U.S. population there. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that once the 
evacuees reach Bujumbura they are to be flown to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is mostly a civilian operation, with cooperation from local authorities 
and Rwandan security," he said of the convoys. "There's a lot of refugee 
traffic under way." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher conferred by telephone throughout the 
morning with Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
and Anthony Lake, Clinton's national security adviser. He also spoke early 
Saturday with the U.S. ambassador in Rwanda, David Rawson, to discuss options 
for "the ordered departure of U.S. personnel, their dependents and other 
American citizens," McCurry said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no reports of specific threats against Americans in Rwanda," 
McCurry said, adding that as of midday in Washington, "things are proceeding 
smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department spokesman said the United States was participating in 
informal discussions in the U.N. Security Council on the violence in Rwanda, 
the safety of foreigners and the status of the U.N. mission there. 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly radio address, Clinton said he is "deeply concerned about the 
continuing violence following the assassination of the president, the prime 
minister and other officials, as well as some of our United Nations 
peacekeepers" in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, he said, he is "very concerned" about the safety of the Americans 
there. "I want you to know that we're doing all we can to ensure their safety," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kigali, the Speaker of the Parliament, Venat Sindikubwabo, announced the 
formation of an interim government. The Speaker, an ally of Habyarimana, the 
assassinated president, said on state radio that he is forming the government 
to restore order and that he wants to contact the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front 
to set up a transitional government within six weeks, Reuters reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The overture to form the transitional government was rejected by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The RPF has irreversibly decided to fight this clique. . . . Let us work 
together to find and bring to book these murderers," Paul Kagame, the rebels' 
military leader, said in a statement said to have been broadcast repeatedly by 
a rebel radio station. Anyone standing in the way of the rebel front, he said, 
"will be considered an accomplice of the murderers and dealt with accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the latest round of violence were Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana, a Tutsi, and other political leaders, human rights advocates, 
aid workers, nuns, priests, ordinary Rwandans and 10 Belgian soldiers, part of 
a 2,500-member U.N. peacekeeping unit. Rwanda was a colony of Belgium that 
gained its independence in July, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels began their violent campaign, which has resulted in thousands of 
deaths, with an invasion from Uganda in 1990.

POLICY DISPUTES WEAKEN JAPAN'S SHAKY COALITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's rainbow coalition confronted the threat of a breakup Saturday as 
leaders of its eight parties failed to agree on policies that a successor to 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should follow. 
</P>
<P>
 They promised to choose a new leader from within their ranks and elect him 
prime minister by the end of this week. But quarrels among themselves 
undermined the credibility of their pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Japan Renewal Party and the Buddhist-backed Komei (Clean 
Government) Party insisted that without a new policy agreement, they would balk 
at forming a new Cabinet within the present framework of seven parties in the 
lower house and eight in the upper chamber of Parliament. But the Socialists, 
whose leftist policies repeatedly hampered Hosokawa during his eight months in 
office, rejected any new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are tax reforms, considered essential to support measures to end a 
three-year recession, and how a new Cabinet will deal with U.S.-Japan economic 
frictions and continuing fears of a North Korean nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's shock resignation came Friday, but he will stay on as caretaker 
until his successor is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure of the eight parties to agree on a new leader would fracture the 
coalition and force its segments to turn to the Liberal Democrats for help. 
Even united, the coalition holds only a five-seat majority in the lower house, 
which elects the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, new splits within the coalition -- as well as the possibility of 
one within the Liberal Democratic Party, which lost its 38-year grasp on power 
last summer -- appeared one after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa officially broke his once close relationship with Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head of the New Party Harbinger, by removing 40 
of his followers from a joint parliamentary negotiating body and registering 
them in a new group under his sole leadership. Later, however, about 10 of the 
Hosokawa followers indicated they would break with him and join Takemura. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Renewal and Komei parties again put out feelers to former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, the leader of the Liberal Democrats' 
third-largest faction, urging him to bolt his party and head a new coalition as 
prime minister. On Saturday, Watanabe all but accepted the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he would do if support for him as a non-Liberal Democrat prime 
minister emerged, Watanabe replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "Any member of Parliament would accept such an offer. That's why we spend 
decades serving in Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathematics remained the main obstacle. A Watanabe candidacy would be certain 
to rupture the present coalition, and whether Watanabe could bring enough LDP 
defectors with him to paste together a majority was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialists, Democratic Socialists and the Harbinger party all spoke out 
against choosing the coalition's most obvious candidate, Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, the titular leader of the Renewal Party. They cited his close 
ties with Ichiro Ozawa, the forceful deputy chief of the Renewal Party who 
served as Hosokawa's top strategist and often pushed policies they opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 So fluid was the situation that, among Japan's 10 parties, only the 
Communists, who have been excluded from the maneuvering, appeared free of fears 
of an intraparty split. 
</P>
<P>
 Minoru Morita, a highly respected political commentator, predicted that the 
coalition will agree to ignore its disputes and pick Hata by next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiaki Imamura, political editor of TV Asahi, speculated on the political 
realignment but could narrow the possibilities to no fewer than three coalition 
mixtures with a total of seven possible successors to Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Imamura's multifaceted speculation omitted one remote possibility -- that 
the Liberal Democrats might ultimately form a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberal Democrats, whose 219 seats fall 37 short of a majority but make 
them the biggest party in the lower house, would need only one coalition 
partner to elect a prime minister. Help from either the Renewal Party, which 
holds 60 seats, or the Komei Party, with 52 seats, would do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Yoshiro Mori, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, announced 
that his party would consider supporting a non-LDP leader as prime minister -- 
a lure apparently designed to produce an LDP-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacuum created by Hosokawa's resignation threatens both U.S.-Japan 
economic relations and hopes for economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan had promised to hammer out by June both a master plan for reducing and 
removing government regulations that inhibit imports and competition within 
Japan and a more forceful program to spur growth in the stagnant economy. 
Without strong leadership from a prime minister, little progress is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats, who had halted budget deliberations for a month to press 
Hosokawa to clarify suspicious financial transactions, finally agreed Saturday 
to participate in debate on the budget for fiscal 1994, which began April 1. 
Deliberations, however, cannot proceed until a new Cabinet is named.

COLUMN ONE; DIET CLINIC TACTICS DRAW FIRE; PATIENTS WERE TOLD OF GLAMOROUS 
STAYS, COURT PAPERS SAY, BUT THEY WERE SENT TO PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. INSURERS 
CLAIM RECORDS WERE FALSIFIED TO OBTAIN PAYMENT. A PLACE FOR US OWNER DENIES THE 
CHARGES.

<P>
 Michael quickly realized that A Place for Us wasn't the place for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Overweight and suffering from stress, the New Yorker had flown cross-country 
to attend what was advertised as a weight-loss clinic in sunny Southern 
California. The air fare was free and the treatment, he was told, fully covered 
by his Blue Cross plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Michael reached Los Angeles, he was shocked to find himself booked 
into a psychiatric hospital in a run-down section of Bellflower where he was 
diagnosed as suffering from psychotic depression and bulimia -- conditions he 
denies ever having. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was told he could not leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael's is one of many stories emerging from federal and state lawsuits in 
Los Angeles in which insurers accuse A Place for Us of enlisting doctors and 
hospital staff to falsify diagnoses and medical records in order to obtain 
payment for treatment that -- whatever its value to patients -- was not covered 
by their health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 A Place for Us, the insurers contend in their lawsuits, was at heart a chain 
of "fat farms" that masqueraded as psychiatric centers because most health 
plans do not cover weight-reduction therapy. During its peak years from 1989 to 
1991, they estimate, the Orlando, Fla.-based program generated $100 million in 
billings. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which also is the focus of a federal grand jury investigation in 
Los Angeles, attracted several thousand patients through nationwide ads on 
television and in magazines such as People and TV Guide. The campaign was 
backed up by a telemarketing sales force and a toll-free phone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing blurbs played up the glamour of the clinic sites here and in Nevada 
and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visit the Queen Mary or take in a tour of one of Hollywood's famous movie 
studios," one brochure invited prospective patients, amid photos of the Beverly 
Center and a bistro at Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For most patients, A Place for Us was a free ride, insurers contend. Air 
tickets, a limousine from the airport to the clinic, four weeks of treatment, 
outings to Disneyland, Universal Studios and the beach -- all were included in 
a therapy regimen whose average cost to insurance companies was $30,000 to 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury probe has resulted in a guilty plea to felony fraud charges by 
a psychiatrist who admitted falsifying patient records to trigger insurance 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychiatrist, Dr. Barry Alan Smolev, is said to be cooperating with 
investigators while awaiting sentencing. He declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's owner, Janet Greeson, author of popular self-help books, is the 
main focus of the federal criminal investigation and insurers' lawsuits. She 
says she is the innocent object of a Blue Cross vendetta that has crippled her 
business, saddling her with personal losses of more than $1 million in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse than the financial losses, Greeson said, the legal turmoil has kept her 
from fulfilling her dream of opening nonprofit counseling clinics in 
cooperation with the Vatican and Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Greeson brandished a list of nearly 100 former patients of A 
Place for Us who she said would testify in her behalf. Indeed, several patients 
telephoned at random from the list warmly praised Greeson and the program. 
</P>
<P>
 She has countersued the Blue Cross affiliates, charging that they have tried 
to ruin her by rejecting her clients' legitimate claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from insurers, A Place for Us has largely folded up. Greeson 
operated a similar program until September at a Houston hospital under the name 
Janet Greeson's Your Life Matters, the third name that Greeson had used for her 
clinics in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Place for Us hit the "radar screen" at Blue Cross of California in April, 
1991, when an unsigned letter reached in-house fraud investigator David R. 
Ignatius. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, entered into court records, charged that A Place for Us patients 
at Van Nuys Community Hospital were being admitted with diagnoses of severe 
mental illness -- most commonly, "major depression" or "psychotic depression" 
-- but the vast majority were really there for eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant described walking in on a meeting where Smolev, the 
psychiatrist, instructed staff members in falsifying medical records to support 
insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members were cautioned against documenting improvement in a patient's 
condition, the informant said, "so that insurance companies would justify 
coverage for the entire four weeks of the program." (Many health plans have 
28-day annual limits on inpatient care.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ignatius obtained a computer printout of claims submitted to Blue Cross by the 
three Los Angeles hospitals then hosting A Place for Us: Van Nuys Community 
Hospital, Los Angeles Doctors Hospital and Bellflower Doctors Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 (A fourth clinic opened later at Suncrest Community Hospital of Orange County. 
Outside California, A Place for Us operated at Womens Hospital in Las Vegas, 
St. Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson, Nev., AMI Medical Center in Orlando, 
and Peninsula Medical Center in Ormond Beach, Fla.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ignatius discovered that a vast majority of the claims submitted by the three 
hospitals were for "major depression" treatment and that virtually all of the 
patients were from out of state and were insured by Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
affiliates in their home states, according to his court declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitals submitted claims to the insurers and paid Greeson's program a 
flat fee for each patient. This had the effect of concealing Greeson's role, 
according to one insurer's legal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, weekend forays to recreation or shopping centers were billed as 
"life skills therapy." Twelve-step workshops were charted as "cognitive 
therapy" and aerobics classes as "physical therapy," the complaint added. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics also routinely waived the 20% co-payment that many patients were 
required to pay under their insurance plans, according to the complaint. That 
had the dual effect of making patients more likely to sign up for the program 
and reducing their financial incentive to alert insurers to any irregularities, 
the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Blue Cross of California shared Ignatius' findings with affiliated plans 
in other states, they began closely scrutinizing claims generated by A Place 
for Us, causing payment to screech to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The denial of claims prompted the three Los Angeles hospitals to file for 
arbitration with Blue Cross. That dispute blossomed into three lawsuits, which 
have generated more than 30 volumes of records in federal and state courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeson, the hospitals and the Blue Cross plans are on the brink of a 
settlement whose terms will be cloaked by a confidentiality agreement, Blue 
Cross lawyer William E. Von Behren said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as that case heads toward conclusion, insurance giant Aetna Life 
Insurance Co. has just filed its own massive federal lawsuit against Greeson 
and the hospital companies, making virtually identical allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the records that surfaced in the Blue Cross case and that have been 
incorporated in Aetna's complaint are internal memos written by staff members 
at Los Angeles Doctors Hospital, suggesting how to resubmit claims that 
insurers had sent back to the clinic for more documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one memo: "This case is very weak in terms of medical necessity. Pt 
(patient) had no prior tx (treatment). She denied ever having suicidal 
thoughts. . . . Recommendation: Send records in order to speed up billing 
process. Most GM (General Motors, the patient's employer) contracts have been 
paying approximately 80% even when no days are cert (certified, or approved in 
advance by the health plan)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "All the records requested would be appropriate to send except 
nurses notes, due to 2 references to limousine, 1 reference to OA (Overeaters 
Anonymous) meeting & 1 reference to working on the steps." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the hospitals initially maintained that they were unaware of any 
falsification of records and that they believed all treatment was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Asklepios Hospital Corp., parent of Los Angeles Doctors and 
Bellflower, broke with the other defendants and reached a separate settlement 
with the Blue Cross affiliates late last year. Asklepios also filed a 
counterclaim against Greeson, repeating many of the Blue Cross allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 William Bluestein, former program director at A Place for Us at Los Angeles 
Doctors Hospital and Van Nuys Community Hospital, said in interviews that when 
the Los Angeles clinics were starting up in 1989 and 1990, most patients had 
genuine psychological problems that led to overeating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the insurance companies wouldn't treat obesity, we had to use the 
fiction," Bluestein said. "It was the insurance companies' fault. Everybody 
felt that way in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 In weekly meetings, A Place for Us staff members were instructed -- sometimes 
by Greeson herself -- how to fill out patients' charts or other records to be 
sure of getting reimbursement, Bluestein said in a court declaration. "Nobody 
was told to lie, but we were told to emphasize certain things," he added in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Greeson's marketing machinery moved into high gear, fueled by the 
national ad blitz, the clinics saw an influx of patients "who were 20 pounds 
overweight or who just wanted to get away," Bluestein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrist Mark J. Mills, a former Massachusetts mental health commissioner 
whom Blue Cross consulted as an expert witness, said in a court declaration 
that psychiatric hospitalization should be avoided unless a patient is acutely 
suicidal, is psychotic, has unremitting severe depression or has repeatedly 
failed to improve under outpatient treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A Place for Us patients whose records Mills reviewed "did not demonstrate any 
of these severe symptoms that would have required extensive inpatient 
hospitalization," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills was also critical of the clinics' practice of admitting patients without 
an initial interview by a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Another former program director, Terry Shapiro, said that patients were 
cleared for admission through conversations with telemarketers on the toll-free 
line. A psychiatrist often would not see them until a day or two after they 
checked into the clinic, he said in a sworn declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also said as many as half of the 200 patients who arrived at the Van 
Nuys unit during his tenure complained about being admitted to a psychiatric 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said that telemarketers at Greeson's headquarters had described the 
facility as a "health spa" or "hacienda," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michael arrived at Bellflower, he was alarmed to find himself in a mental 
hospital and feared that a psychiatric admission would hurt his career, he said 
in court statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission documents listed his diagnosis as "depression psychosis/severe" and 
bulimia, both of which were false, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few days at the Bellflower facility, Michael said he demanded to go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was informed by the staff member that my return airline tickets to New York 
were locked in the safe and that if I left before the end of my full scheduled 
admission that I might be responsible for paying out of my own pocket the 
remaining days' balance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael eventually got his ticket and was allowed to go home early. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients anticipating the glitz of Beverly Hills might have found it jarring 
to be deposited -- especially by limousine -- at Bellflower Doctors Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The main building -- a two-story box with a gray stone facade -- is arguably 
the handsomest structure on a dreary stretch of Artesia Boulevard occupied by 
body shops, storefront insurance offices, the crumbling Midtowne trailer park 
and Willie's Detail Shop ("Give Willie Your Auto but Give Jesus Your Soul," the 
sign advises). 
</P>
<P>
 Belen Garcia, who hails from the Central Valley town of Reedley, said many of 
her fellow patients at Bellflower complained about the facility and initially 
asked to be sent home. Most eventually were talked into staying, she said, but 
a few were allowed to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia discovered that she was practically the only Californian at Bellflower 
during her stay. She recalled in an interview that A Place for Us staffers had 
strongly urged her to fly to Florida to attend the program. But never having 
been on an airplane and fearful of traveling so far from home, she had insisted 
on staying in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Most patients attended A Place for Us clinics in other states, which made it 
more difficult for their home-state health plans to discover problems with the 
program, Blue Cross said. Frank L. Ettin, an attorney for Blue Cross of 
California, explained that when dealing with out-of-state patients, hospitals 
bill the local Blue Cross or Blue Shield affiliate and the affiliate seeks 
reimbursement from the patient's home-state plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it can count on such reimbursement with no questions asked, Ettin 
said, the local Blue Cross plan might not pay as close attention to 
out-of-state claims as it would to those of its own patients. Ettin 
acknowledged that this is a weakness that Blue Cross is trying to rectify. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients have said in court declarations that their clinic bills sometimes 
listed treatment they never received or that the time spent with psychiatrists 
and other therapists was exaggerated. Group discussions, for example, might 
appear as individual sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 During her stay, Garcia said, the Bellflower facility was overcrowded, the 
program was disorganized and the days were full of boredom, broken up by 
occasional trips to the beach or to theme parks and by regular visits to 
12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Overeaters Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she did not have a drinking problem, she said, she learned to be 
assertive in such meetings and was able to draw some lessons from them. In that 
way, she said, A Place for Us benefited her. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the trips to the 12-step meetings were not always closely supervised, 
investigators say. Blue Cross investigator Bob Casey recalled his surveillance 
of a vanload of patients being transported from A Place for Us in Las Vegas to 
an Overeaters Anonymous meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 As other patients filed into the building for the overeaters session, "these 
two ladies just hooked on down the street and went into Burger King and had it 
their way," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bellflower, where patients were put on a low-fat, sugar-free diet, Garcia 
said she lost 11 pounds, but gained it back afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Greeson twice visited the Bellflower unit during her stay, Garcia said. 
Clinic employees asked the patients not to raise complaints during Greeson's 
visits, and most patients adhered to the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who is 5 feet 4 and 200 pounds, said she was surprised by Greeson's 
appearance: "I expected her to be thinner. She's my size." 
</P>
<P>
 Greeson, who calls herself a recovering food addict, said she weighs 190 and 
is comfortable with her size. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at her headquarters, a modest suite of offices in a one-story 
commercial building, Greeson said that during the years when she vacillated 
between crash diets and binges, she hit 350 pounds. After developing her own 
techniques to address problems she realized were psychologically based, Greeson 
said, she shed more than 150 pounds and has kept it off for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeson, 50, described her metamorphosis in her hit book, "It's Not What 
You're Eating, It's What's Eating You," a 28-day plan to heal hidden food 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite modest expectations from publisher Pocket Books (the initial 1990 
printing, in paperback, was 10,000 copies), Greeson's book has become a 
stunning success in the self-help genre, with more than 250,000 copies in print 
and a new hardcover edition. 
</P>
<P>
 The book -- like its recently published sequel, "Food for Love: Healing the 
Food, Sex, Love & Intimacy Relationship" -- reflects Greeson's view that eating 
disorders arise from deep-seated psychological problems, often caused by trauma 
associated with childhood sexual abuse. She has said that as many as 
three-quarters of A Place for Us patients were, like Greeson, victims of incest 
or other sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming her compulsion has given Greeson serenity in dealing with other 
challenges, she said, but serenity does not equal passivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeson, in interviews, defended her programs combatively. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's bull----!" she said several times, dismissing allegations by patients 
and former employees such as Bluestein and Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluestein turned against her after she disciplined him for sexually harassing 
patients, Greeson said. Bluestein said later that there was no basis for the 
allegation and that he quit the clinic over ethical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 To the basic accusation that A Place for Us used false medical diagnoses to 
obtain insurance payments, she said: "It's a lie. How can I get all these 
psychiatrists to lie about a diagnosis? I have that much power? Nobody's going 
to put their credentials and license on the line for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Greeson said she is unaware of where the federal criminal probe stands. Other 
than a January, 1992, interview that the FBI scheduled with her and then 
canceled, "I haven't heard a word," she said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeson, who uses the title of "doctor," holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology 
from Columbia Pacific University, an unaccredited correspondence school in San 
Rafael. For several years, she ran addiction counseling centers as a civilian 
employee of the Navy before establishing her treatment clinics beginning in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court declaration, Greeson referred to Michael, the New Yorker who said 
he was surprised to be in a psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only explanation which I have for the statement . . . that he did not 
know his diagnosis," she said, "is that one of the symptoms of depression is 
difficulty in concentrating, or that the patient was engaging in denial." 
</P>
<P>
 Greeson said that she has lost more than $1 million because of the legal 
actions against her. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged that the program made money in its peak years but added: 
"Everything I ever made I put into this company." 
</P>
<P>
 According to real estate records, Greeson owns homes and income property in 
Orlando, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, including two condos in a luxury high-rise 
on Doheny Drive in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those properties are heavily mortgaged, Greeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm basically broke," she said. "My liabilities exceed my assets." 
</P>
<P>
 As to the future, Greeson said she will continue to market her books, as well 
as self-produced audio- and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 She has no more hospital relationships but conducts seminars and outpatient 
therapy. "It's better than nothing," Greeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals tell her they are being driven out of the inpatient psychiatric 
business by the insurers' pressure for cost containment. "You can't get 
patients admitted anymore," Greeson said.

ELECTIONS MAY TEST SEN. HURTT'S STRATEGY TO CRAFT GOP MAJORITY; POLITICS: IN 
HIS BID TO PUT REPUBLICANS BACK IN POWER IN SACRAMENTO, THE CONSERVATIVE 
LEGISLATOR HOPES TO SEAL HIS OWN FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He burst into the staid chambers of the state Senate a year ago, a political 
outsider crashing the most exclusive of clubs. Life in the Capitol hasn't been 
quite the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative rookies are expected to quietly find their spot on a back bench, 
but Rob Hurtt -- Orange County businessman, conservative Republican, 
evangelical Christian -- would have none of that. Hurtt had just spent $300,000 
to win a state Senate seat. Like any good capitalist, he wanted his money's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The upstart lawmaker, who had never before held elected office, spent his 
first year testing the traditions of the political Establishment. He talked 
precociously of becoming Senate Republican leader and griped about his party's 
complacency. Occasionally, Hurtt brashly questioned GOP veterans about floor 
votes he felt were anti-Republican. Democratic leaders quickly labeled him a 
bully. 
</P>
<P>
 But his biggest splash has come with the huge sums of campaign cash Hurtt 
funnels to other like-minded candidates. In the brutal election battles of the 
California Legislature, Hurtt has become the Republican T . rex. In the past 
two years, the senator has joined with three other Christian businessmen to 
contribute a whopping $3.6 million to conservative candidates and causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come the elections of 1994, and for Rob Hurtt, the future could be just a 
few precinct victories away. He is the GOP's Senate point man on campaign 
strategy, and perhaps the chief architect of the Republican Party's latest 
grand design to recapture the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to GOP plans, the party will gain ground in the Assembly 
and Senate during this year's races, then seize power in one or both houses in 
1996. Should that scenario unfold, the junior senator from Orange County could 
probably script whatever political future he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a pretty heady possibility for a lifelong industrialist who, until 
recently, had never tinkered with California's political machinery. Before 
politics, Hurtt was into cans, building a fortune with his Garden Grove company 
that manufactures decorative tins and plastic containers. By most accounts, the 
hard-driving senator has nimbly switched hats from businessman to politician, 
using money and gumption to acquire a position of influence many lawmakers 
never achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Rob is the best thing that has happened to the Republican Party in 
many, many years," said state Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange), a conservative ally 
from Orange County. "For years, we've been outmanned and outspent by the 
Democrats. Rob is the great equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many conservatives look to the 49-year-old senator as a political 
messiah, Democrats are alternately bemused and bewildered, irritated and 
incensed. And worried. 
</P>
<P>
 As they mobilize to defend the Capitol turf they have controlled for decades, 
Democratic leaders point to Hurtt as the prime threat -- and not just because 
of the money he commands. Hurtt may promote himself as a "citizen legislator" 
and champion of business, but Democratic chiefs contend that the public facade 
masks the Bible-based platform of the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the Senate leader, suggests the Republican 
freshman and the Allied Business PAC, the political action committee Hurtt 
formed with Orange County savings-and-loan heir Howard Ahmanson, are bent on 
creating a "religious oligarchy." If conservative Republicans sweep into power, 
an era of New Testament intolerance would follow, Lockyer warns: "Our 
democratic institutions are threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt is weary of the dire rhetoric, saying Democrats are "trying to make me 
into a bogyman." Yes, he believes in traditional two-parent families, is 
staunchly against abortion, opposes specific rights for gays and supports 
conservative goals such as school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists, however, that he has no desire to see California become a 
theocracy. For now, he is content to vote against taxes, sponsor legislation to 
fight unions and work to slash regulations hampering industry. The conservative 
social issues are important, Hurtt concedes, but they can wait until 
California's recession-racked economy rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Hurtt assures doubters, "there's no reason for alarm. Our agenda 
is pretty much America and apple pie." 
</P>
<P>
 The man himself, friends say, is hardly puritanical. He drinks in social 
settings and laments that he has taken up smoking again after more than a dozen 
years of abstinence (he vows to quit). To pass evenings away from home, Hurtt 
often invites Republican allies over for low-stakes poker in his hotel suite. 
And while many of his legislative cohorts tool around town in tax-subsidized 
Buicks and Lincolns, Hurtt pilots a sports car he bought with his own cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative colleagues say he is glib and quick-witted, principled and 
competitive, a hard charger and a fast learner. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is so kind. Some moderate Republicans, who spoke on condition 
they remain unidentified, contend that Hurtt is a politician with an attitude, 
flaunting an imperious nature developed during years as a boss in the business 
world. They also grumble about his freshman mistakes and occasional 
cantankerous confrontations. One veteran lawmaker complained, "He can tell you 
off with a smile on his face." 
</P>
<P>
 But get Hurtt talking about his boyhood and he can be downright charming. A 
product of Pasadena public schools, the 5-foot-8 senator tells of getting 
knocked unconscious in a high school football game and wobbling to the 
sidelines: "The coach spun me around and said, 'No, son, the other sideline.' " 
Hurtt also played tennis with future Wimbledon champ Stan Smith. "He was two 
years younger than I was," Hurtt recalled. "Whipped his butt." 
</P>
<P>
 After college, Hurtt went to work for his dad's can manufacturing firm, 
Container Supply Co. The firm prospered, with sales of $23 million in 1990. 
Underlying that success is his father's simple philosophy: Don't operate on 
borrowed money. It's a law Hurtt says the state of California should emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for Hurtt's political mission can be found in part at his Garden 
Grove factory, a bustling maze of assembly lines and punch presses. That sound 
and fury of free enterprise has drawn the scrutiny of regulatory agencies, 
notably the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the AQMD hates, this great big ugly thing," Hurtt said one 
recent afternoon, waving a hand at a huge oven that bakes ink labels onto 
aluminum cans -- and produces the building blocks of smog. Hurtt has been 
battling the AQMD for years over how much the oven can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt was also prodded toward politics by watching his four children grow up 
in a world much changed from his youth. The watershed came when he talked with 
a high school counselor about his eldest son's mediocre grades. The counselor 
told Hurtt not to worry. His boy was a good kid, never got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "A light bulb went on," Hurtt recalls. "They didn't care if he wasn't learning 
anything. As long as he wasn't causing problems, they thought he was great." 
</P>
<P>
 The spiritual element played a role in his political conversion. Hurtt began 
attending a men's Bible study group in the mid-1980s, and joined an evangelical 
church in Santa Ana. He also drew inspiration from the work of James Dobson, 
whose evangelical operation in Colorado Springs, Colo., produces books, tapes, 
videos and the nationwide radio program "Focus on the Family." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Hurtt decided to put his money where his convictions were. 
He founded Capitol Resource Institute, a conservative Sacramento group that 
specializes in family issues. But the businessman quickly learned the limits of 
lobbying for conservative causes in the Democrat-dominated state Capitol. Hurtt 
turned to trying to remake the Legislature in a conservative image. 
</P>
<P>
 He began in 1990 by donating modestly to a few Orange County candidates. But 
the campaign contributions skyrocketed with the creation of Allied Business PAC 
before the 1992 elections. Hurtt and his three cohorts quickly became a force, 
helping elect 12 of the more than two dozen conservatives they supported that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt took the plunge himself when a central Orange County Senate seat was 
vacated, saying he feared a Democrat might swoop down and defeat a weak field 
of GOP contenders. He cruised to victory in March, 1993, with 76% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in the state Capitol and immediately made waves. In one episode, 
senators blanched after he voted in committee for a jail construction bond, 
then joked loudly to a prison guards lobbyist to remember it when Hurtt came 
calling for a campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Some colleagues contend that Hurtt's first-year difficulties went beyond 
snippy rhetoric. They say he failed miserably to heed advice from legislative 
veterans, as if oblivious to the Capitol's cardinal rules: Experience and 
knowledge count, and political friendships are based almost as much upon 
personality as on ideology and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Those facts smacked Hurtt in the face after he made noises about challenging 
Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) for Senate GOP leader. Despite his campaign clout, 
Hurtt fell far short of the support he needed when the leadership fight came to 
a head last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was quite honest with him and told Rob he needs to pay his dues," said Sen. 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). "Being leader doesn't just mean you get 
Republicans elected." 
</P>
<P>
 In a conciliatory gesture, Maddy named Hurtt chairman of the Senate's new 
elections committee. Some see it as a shrewd ploy by Maddy -- the leader can 
take credit for election victories, but blame Hurtt if the GOP stumbles this 
year. Hurtt has tried to make the most of the post, but expresses frustration 
over the committee's lack of aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 On the legislative front, Hurtt broke from tradition and was the only lawmaker 
from either party who didn't support Lockyer's nomination in January for 
president pro tem of the Senate. In early March, Hurtt was one of only three 
Senate Republicans to join in overriding the governor's veto of a Democratic 
illegal immigration bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the Democrats need Hurtt. That fact was vividly illustrated a 
few weeks ago when all 40 senators gathered for an annual photograph. Sen. Tom 
Hayden, the liberal from Santa Monica best known for his Vietnam-era activism 
and marriage to actress Jane Fonda, arrived late. Finding his spot, Hayden 
paused to shake hands with Hurtt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Photo opportunity!" one of the senators quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but which one will it hurt more?" remarked another, prompting laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been a joke, but therein lies a political truth: Rob Hurtt has 
become the poster boy for the Democratic fund-raising machine. 
</P>
<P>
 When visiting potential donors, Lockyer totes charts warning of a "theocratic" 
threat posed by Hurtt and his moneyed allies. The pitch is well-received. 
"Voters," Lockyer said, "don't want to be governed by extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt says Lockyer and other critics have it all wrong. Given his way, Hurtt 
wouldn't force-feed religion, he maintains. Rather, he has a vision of society 
flipping back the calendar. 
</P>

ON CALIFORNIA: RECALL BLOODY RECALL 
</P>

<P>
 A second-grade teacher, Janet Geng, had playground duty that January day five 
years ago. She recalls breaking up a fight at the tetherball court, bending 
down to talk with a child, hearing a noise. She recalls clumps of asphalt 
kicking up along a straight line. She followed the line until she found the 
source. She saw a man in a military stance, a black gun and red sparks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get down!" she screamed at the children. "Get down!" 
</P>
<P>
 These were the littlest students at Cleveland School, about 400 of them, and 
they filled the playground. Now some dove into a sandbox. Most ran for the 
schoolhouse. "Everything seemed to be in slow-motion," Geng says. "Never had I 
seen so many kids running so slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange what memory will edit. Geng cannot recall the face of the gunman, who 
later would be identified as a mentally troubled drifter named Patrick Purdy. 
She cannot recall a child falling dead a few steps away, one of five Purdy 
killed that day before taking his own life. She does recall turning to run. 
Then she was on the ground. Her leg felt like a balloon that been blown too 
full and popped. She tried to slither across the pavement, but made no 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman kept firing, sweeping back and forth, 105 rounds in all. She had to 
have seen his face. "On the fifth sweep," Geng says, "I just turned my back to 
him. I remember thinking about John F. Kennedy. As a kid the big issue had been 
how Kennedy's brains had splattered all over the car, and I told myself I did 
not want my brains splattered all over the playground. I thought about my 
children and waited to die. I don't know how he missed me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Mackey taught deaf children in a temporary classroom. She recalls looking 
out a window. Six paces away stood a man in battle dress, blazing away with an 
AK-47. "He had such a determined look on his face," she says. Mackey can 
remember how Geng's body jerked when the bullet hit, "but I can't remember her 
falling down. I can remember the noise of the gun, but it was like I had no 
concept someone was shooting at the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 In sign, she told her pupils to hide under a table. They watched the teacher 
and tried to read her face. She watched the windows, and could follow the tip 
of the rifle as the assailant walked right behind the classroom to a new 
shooting position. She kept her face blank. Survival, she remembers thinking, 
depended on quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced," she says, "that the only reason we're alive today is that he 
didn't know we were there." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the playground, in another classroom, Melanie Foss had thought she 
heard firecrackers. She looked out and saw children running. The gunfire lasted 
only minutes, but her pupils stayed huddled on the floor a long time afterward, 
whimpering, whispering. They knew there were children hit outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying to themselves," she said, " 'Is it my sister? Is it my 
brother?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Foss looked out again. She saw blood, bullet holes, bodies. Wounded youngsters 
were "piled up" outside classroom doors that had been locked at recess. What 
has stuck with her most vividly, though, is an eerie image of "basketballs and 
kick balls and other balls rolling slowly across the playground. It was all 
quiet, except for the distant sound of sirens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, these teachers still speak with something like awe about the 
power of Purdy's assault rifle. It pierced holes in iron tetherball poles, 
ripped through walls. It was so loud that students dove for cover at a school 
three blocks away. Mackey's pupils later recalled that although they heard 
nothing, they could feel the gunfire's vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnage was extreme, breaking apart little bodies, leaving a hole in 
Geng's thigh the size of a grapefruit. In a way, the bullets keep ricocheting. 
The teachers speak of disturbed children, derailed careers, bad dreams, 
divorce. "Oh," says Foss, "I could tell you stories." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Geng, Mackey and Foss all made public pleas for tighter 
controls on combat weapons. In return they received hate mail from gun 
enthusiasts. These gun people tend to see themselves as enlightened patriots, 
who alone perceive that massacres on schoolyards are but a cost of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 From the gun ranks came people instrumental in forcing an election Tuesday in 
the San Fernando Valley. They want to "punish" -- their word -- state Sen. 
David Roberti for a bill that, in response to the Cleveland schoolyard attack, 
banned certain assault weapons. What they want is for "the people" to recall 
Roberti. What they don't want anybody to recall, however, is what started all 
this. What they don't want recalled is that bloody day in Stockton, Jan. 17, 
1989.

AIDA GREY, SKIN CARE INNOVATOR, DIES; COSMETICS: FRANCHISE FOUNDER CREATED 
RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE WARES TO WARD OFF TIRED SKIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aida Grey, the doyenne of skin care who founded a series of cosmetic 
franchises that today are busy battling wrinkles and the other menacing marks 
of age, died Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for her Beverly Hills-based company said Miss Grey, the daughter 
of a French dermatologist who had battled acne as a teen-ager, died at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been ill for some time and her death was attributed to heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The cosmetics counselor to Marilyn Monroe and hundreds of thousands of 
lesser-known women and men in the United States and Europe was always secretive 
about her age. She was believed to be in her mid-80s, although she did not look 
it and denied that she had ever had a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Aida Grey products that kept Aida Grey looking 20 years younger than 
she was, she liked to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Her credo was: "Everybody's born with good skin. . . . It's what you do with 
your skin that counts." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a town where appearance often ranks ahead of reality she offered women 
(and later men) relatively inexpensive wares to ward off tired skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were cucumber lotions, raspberry masks and time-release 
mini-facials. She wrote and spoke extensively about skin care, advocating her 
collagen moisturizers, in-store facials and deep-pore cleaning to restore and 
maintain the diminishing glow of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her most innovative creations was a seaweed facial that lasts 90 minutes 
and leaves a mask that is lifted from the client's face. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Women's Wear Daily estimated her annual wholesale volume at $4 
million to $5 million. The more than 100 franchises she launched in the United 
States, Kenya, Portugal, Ireland and elsewhere receive big discounts for 
purchasing the estimated 150 items shipped from a huge warehouse in Beverly 
Hills, home of her extravagant Institute de Beaute on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miss Grey, in an accent that reflected her French heritage, said she never 
sought fame while amassing a small fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was individual service that brought her satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be custom-style," she said in 1987. "We blend everything and we 
match things to people. I don't want mass production." 
</P>
<P>
 She was among the first to preach the advantages of holistic treatments, using 
fruits, vegetables and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Grey began her beauty empire in the 1940s after finding, she said, that 
she was allergic to her own cosmetics. Her first salon was a relatively modest 
5,000-square-foot treatment and makeup center in Beverly Hills. From the 
beginning, she said she never claimed, as did so many others, that her 
treatments could remove wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only plastic surgery removes wrinkles," she would say. But her creams and 
lotions (some of which sold for only $5 or $6) could help postpone that 
procedure or make it unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who sought her advice and guidance could have paid 10 times her 
prices: among them Cary Grant, Joan Crawford, Julie Christie, Ingrid Bergman, 
Jacqueline Bisset, Nancy Reagan and Miss Monroe, who Miss Grey said "was not a 
great beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 For all her public posturing, she was a private person. A Los Angeles Times 
reporter in 1979 asked about her private life and in response was told about 
the benefits of ginseng lotion. 
</P>
<P>
 All Miss Grey would advance without reluctance was: "I was put on this earth 
to help people look better. That is what I am all about." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that because of her modest prices, women who had resigned themselves 
to looking old could slow or reverse the process. 
</P>
<P>
 And they did not have to sleep with a gooey night cream on their skin. "You're 
wasting your time and your love life. Your skin is like your stomach, it 
thrives on very small meals, very frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 Creams and lotions should be used only 20 minutes and then removed. "And no 
makeup or skin care product should cost $100 unless it's in a gallon jug." 
</P>
<P>
 While the heart of her operation was in sunny Southern California, she 
preached that sun and healthy skin were adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Her charitable works included complimentary consultations to the UCLA School 
of Public Health, the Sybil Brand Institute for Women, St. Anne's Maternity 
Home, the Veterans Administration and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her other honors, she was named "entrepreneur of the year" by the Los 
Angeles YWCA in 1991. The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive 
Surgery has recognized her efforts to improve the understanding of their 
specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 She continued to write beauty columns for newspapers and magazines until 
shortly before her recent illness. Her Encyclopedia of Beauty is scheduled to 
be published soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, she was "slightly flamboyant," wrote a Times fashion writer several 
years ago. "Pleasantly rounded, perfectly manicured, conservatively coiffed . . 
. (she) commands attention wherever she goes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an aura, Miss Grey said, she had created for herself and which any 
woman could emulate. And it was her hope that "every woman will do just that." 
</P>
<P>
 In her memory, her Beverly Hills and Biltmore Hotel salons will be closed 
Monday so employees may attend her funeral at noon at Mt. Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include her husband, Douglas Behrend, an attorney; a son, Steven; a 
daughter, Loretta Dix; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

FEELING THE STING; BUSINESS: MORE THAN HALF OF VENTURA COUNTY'S APIARIES HAVE 
CLOSED, AND OTHERS ARE THREATENED BY LOW HONEY PRICES, PARASITES AND THE 
EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF THE AFRICANIZED BEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Crouching into the cab of her beat-up yellow truck, beekeeper Ann Bennett 
performed the meticulous task of transferring pinhead-size queen bee larvae 
into new hives. 
</P>
<P>
 As she carried out this yearly ritual, deep within an orange grove, Bennett 
comforted the tiny insects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," she said softly. "There are good things in store for you. Soon 
you'll be a queen." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bennett could speak with confidence about the bees' future, she and 
her husband, Red Bennett, are more wary about their own. 
</P>
<P>
 As the year's prime honey season rolls around again, the financial and 
physical perils of the bee business are becoming so numerous that local 
beekeepers are souring on life amid the sweet smells of orange blossoms and 
honey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the conditions are changing, I think a lot of people aren't getting 
the enjoyment out of beekeeping that they once did," said Red Bennett, who has 
been a commercial beekeeper for more than a decade. "The industry has 
definitely hit a rough patch." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, the number of commercial beekeepers in Ventura County 
has dropped from more than a dozen to about five, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercially owned hives in Piru, Ojai and Ventura and hives farmed by 
hobbyists in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks are being sold, given away or 
intentionally poisoned as the industry falls prey to a host of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Local beekeepers blame the decline in part on a glut of imported honey from 
China, which has sent prices through the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who have been able to endure the drop in honey prices are 
questioning whether they can survive a recent surge in bee parasites and the 
impending arrival of more aggressive, Africanized honeybees. 
</P>
<P>
 That combination, they said, could spell doom for local beekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has had a bee industry for years, Bennett said, because many 
local farmers prefer to use bees to pollinate their crops rather than leave the 
process to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of avocado groves and flower farms call on beekeepers to bring in their 
hives every year for pollination, according to Ben Faber, a Ventura-based farm 
adviser from the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Faber said, the decline of local beekeepers has forced 
Ventura County growers to turn to beekeepers as far as Florida to help 
pollinate their crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just spoke to a grower last week who had been using the same local 
beekeeper for the past five years," Faber said. "When he dialed the guy up this 
year, there was no one at the end of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the need for bees, nearly every commercial beekeeper in Ventura 
County has hives on the selling block. 
</P>
<P>
 The keepers make $15 to $20 per hive by renting them to farmers, but the bulk 
of the income from keeping bees comes from honey sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a peak in the 1970s of about 65 cents per pound, Bennett said, the 
wholesale price of honey has dipped to a rate of about 45 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't even get the wholesalers to talk to us anymore," said veteran 
beekeeper William E. Farlow of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see this happening to such a wonderful business." 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow's apiary, like most of those around Ventura County, is a family-run 
enterprise driven by the allure of self-employment and the chance to work 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a beekeeper is like being an alcoholic," said 65-year-old Farlow, who 
has been in the business for 40 years. "Once it gets in your system, you can't 
get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow, whose small Ventura business produced 50 tons of honey last year, is 
now worried that the job that has supported him will not survive to support his 
son, David. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the problems of falling honey prices, bee farmers like Farlow 
have fought off attacks by two types of parasitic mites, which can ravage 
hives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Farlow is gearing up for the long-ballyhooed arrival of aggressive 
Africanized honey bees, which have moved from Brazil as far north as Texas, 
Baja California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is some hope that these bees can invigorate the industry 
because they are prolific honey producers, beekeepers fear the fierce bees will 
create a host of new hassles and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The African bees are ferocious," Farlow said, not only because it takes 
little more than the vibrations of a tractor to provoke them, but because 
farmers are afraid beehives will pose a liability threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance people won't let people keep bees on their ranch because 
they're afraid the bees will seriously hurt someone," Farlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beekeepers -- commercial operations and hobbyists alike -- have long relied on 
the farmers to allow them to keep hives out on ranches so the bees could 
pollinate the crops. 
</P>
<P>
 As the growing seasons shift, most beekeepers travel with truckloads of 
beehives to farms where they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow recently returned to Ventura from Bakersfield, where almond growers 
used his bees for pollination. 
</P>
<P>
 The beekeepers maintain the hives, breed new colonies and collect the honey, 
which forms in gobs along wood panels filled with wax honeycombs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the groves of Piru, commercial beekeeper Bennett's bees whiz freely through 
the orange blossoms, returning by instinct to the white wooden boxes so they 
can begin converting orange pollen into some of the finest quality honey. 
</P>
<P>
 In groves in Simi Valley, hobbyist Len Bellenson used to keep as many as 100 
hives without fear of upsetting neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Bellenson said, he has only a handful of hives and he, too, is 
getting out of beekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved doing it," Bellenson said. "It was wonderful relaxation, but now I'm 
too concerned about getting sued." 
</P>
<P>
 Bellenson said that as the Africanized bees are found closer and closer to 
Ventura County, the price for insurance rises, and the threat of a lawsuit 
becomes more real. He said he is one of the last hobbyists in east Ventura 
County, and he will soon give his handful of hives away. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, said Red Bennett, is that the aggressive bees may take the joy 
out of beekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Red and Ann Bennett both feel completely at ease around the bees. They are 
able to judge the bees' moods by the weather, choosing to skip work on days 
when it is cold and gray and the bees are more volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 They are comfortable working around hives amid virtual clouds of bees with 
little more than a screen over their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not to say we don't get stung," Ann Bennett said after working 
barehanded with the bees for five hours one day this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at my hands," she said, scanning her callused skin for evidence of a new 
sting. "These are not beautiful hands anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bennetts said that the pleasure of working without thick gloves and 
body armor protection will disappear when the aggressive bees arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to wear 50% more gear, and we'll still get stung 50% more of the 
time," Red Bennett said. "Nobody looks forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
 But that will be the price to stay in the business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hope for area beekeepers to make a living will come if they learn to 
work with the Africanized bees, Faber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive bees, he said, are more vigorous workers and will produce more 
honey. If they can be bred with the less harmful bees, there is some hope the 
industry will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly the chance beekeepers will be able to work with these 
bees," Faber said. "But even if they can solve that problem, it's not the only 
one they face. We're still quite concerned about the future."

AX-WIELDING ARAB KILLED IN ISRAEL AS VIOLENCE PERSISTS; MIDEAST: MAN, 18, 
APPARENTLY BENT ON AVENGING MOSQUE MASSACRE IS SHOT BY SOLDIERS HE TRIED TO 
ATTACK. 
</P>

<P>
 A young Palestinian from the Gaza Strip was shot dead Saturday when he tried 
to attack a group of Israeli soldiers with an ax, deepening the bitterness of a 
violent week as negotiators prepared to resume talks on Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli border guards were deployed around an East Jerusalem 
hotel, blocking a scheduled conference on the 30th anniversary of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and sending participants marching through the streets 
with American civil rights leader Jesse Jackson to an alternate site. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, still frustrated by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's failure to personally 
condemn two terrorist attacks last week that killed eight Israelis, announced 
new determination to impose an economic seal on the occupied Palestinian 
territories. Since Thursday, travel restrictions have prevented up to 70,000 
Palestinians from going to their jobs in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture Minister Yaacov Tsur said the Israeli Cabinet will meet today to 
set recruitment figures for foreign workers to replace Palestinian laborers in 
Israel. "The most important thing is organizing for a longer term of closure," 
Tsur said, "recognizing that the main goal is to return the sense of security 
to residents of Israel and to create a situation in which workers from the 
territories will not enter." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials, furious at the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said 
Israel is transforming Palestinian lives into "a true hell." They said the 
peace talks, scheduled to resume today in Cairo, have little chance of 
producing an agreement by the Wednesday deadline envisioned under the 
Declaration of Principles signed by Israel and the PLO last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal is dying, and the diplomatic process is reaching a total impasse," 
Yasser Abed-Rabbo, head of the PLO information department, told reporters in 
Tunis, Tunisia. "Even if the talks resume tomorrow, there will not be results 
before April 13, nor the month's end." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday afternoon's attempted ax attack took place at the northernmost 
crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian sources identified the attacker as Atef Abed, 18. They said that 
the ax was engraved with Hamas and that he was carrying a Koran and leaflets of 
the Muslim extremist group. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third attack in a week mounted in apparent retaliation for the Feb. 
25 massacre of about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque. On Wednesday, a 
suicide car bomb attack against a crowded bus in the northern Israel town of 
Afula killed seven Israelis. A day later, one Israeli was killed in a drive-by 
shooting in the port city of Ashdod. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson traveled to Afula on Saturday to visit victims of the bombing. 
Earlier, in Jerusalem, Jackson and a number of Palestinian leaders were blocked 
from holding an academic conference at the hotel where the PLO was founded in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Defying a government order prohibiting them from holding the conference in 
Jerusalem or Hebron, participants marched to the Orient House, a nearby 
headquarters of the Palestinians, where the conference was allowed to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years ago, a conference met here to liberate Palestine and destroy 
Israel. And today we are saying coexistence and peace. I think it would mean 
more to say this today in the same place," conference organizer Nabil abu Zneid 
said before leaving the Ambassador Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was scheduled to give the conference's keynote address, compared 
Saturday's events to the attempt by black students in 1954 to enter Little Rock 
High School in Arkansas. President Dwight D. Eisenhower deployed troops to back 
the students up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, the opposite is happening," Jackson said. "The troops are here 
not to stop those who would sabotage the peace process but to stop those who 
would implement the peace process." Jackson said he would make a personal 
appeal to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who was to be host of a dinner for him 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why the U.S. must play a very aggressive role in this area," Jackson 
said. "The Israelis and Palestinians are still like two very strong people who 
have a death grip on each other, and each is afraid to turn the other loose. 
The U.S. must push them apart and offer both of them what neither can offer the 
other: mutual security and a plan for institutional growth."

IN PAKISTAN, U.S. ENVOY UPBEAT ON ARMS LIMITS; ASIA: STROBE TALBOTT'S MISSION 
WAS TO FORESTALL NUCLEAR BRINKMANSHIP BY ISLAMABAD OR INDIA. 'MUCH WAS 
ACCOMPLISHED,' HE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite some blunt public statements by Pakistan, Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott voiced "high optimism" Saturday as he ended discussions there on 
regional nuclear arms control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have just completed a very good day of talks in Islamabad," Talbott said 
after lunching with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and meeting other Pakistani 
officials. "Much was accomplished today." 
</P>
<P>
 In his maiden voyage abroad as Secretary of State Warren Christopher's top 
deputy, Talbott flew into the subcontinent Wednesday to try to stem the rot in 
U.S. relations with India and Pakistan and to promote a plan for preventing 
them from engaging in nuclear brinkmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration blueprint calls for separate but parallel 
approaches to India and Pakistan to encourage both to cap their nuclear 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Delhi, where Talbott met Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao on Friday, 
the reception was far from enthusiastic. Talbott was told that "we don't 
believe third parties should look for equality, parity or balance between 
Pakistan and India," one official source said. 
</P>
<P>
 India specifically objected to the U.S. offer to sell Pakistan 38 F-16 fighter 
planes in exchange for a verifiable freeze on Islamabad's nuclear program. U.S. 
experts believe the Pakistanis have enriched enough uranium to have 
manufactured the cores for seven Hiroshima-style bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Talbott's arrival in Islamabad, Bhutto flatly ruled out agreeing 
to unilateral inspections of her country's nuclear facilities as a way to 
obtain the high-performance warplanes, which Pakistan has paid for. U.S. law 
has prohibited delivery of the jets because Pakistan is suspected of building 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Talbott's discussions with Bhutto, President Farooq Leghari, Foreign 
Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali and others, a more nuanced position than the 
one publicly expressed by the prime minister reportedly emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pakistanis indicated that they are not opposed to outside inspections in 
principle. Instead, they reportedly said, a mechanism has to be devised to keep 
India from learning of the exact magnitude and achievements of a secretive 
program that the Islamabad government has always maintained is exclusively 
peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Pakistanis reportedly did not reject the tit-for-tat bargain with 
the United States that would lead to a verifiable cap on their nuclear program 
but said India would have to commit to a similar arrangement so they could sell 
the deal to their public. 
</P>
<P>
 New Delhi's stand has been that it cannot agree to nuclear restrictions that 
do not constrain China, its much more powerful neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan's response has been to propose a disarmament conference attended by 
China, the United States, Russia, Pakistan and India. But Indian officials did 
not approve that proposal in their talks with Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
 India and Pakistan have acrimonious relations caused largely by their 
longstanding territorial dispute over Jammu-Kashmir. Talbott made it clear that 
the conflict will make agreement on a nuclear cap difficult to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is much on that subject that needs to be done," he told reporters after 
his talks with the Pakistanis. But he said he will leave Islamabad today "with 
quite a high optimism." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott, the highest-ranking American to visit India since October, 1985, 
stressed to the Indians that he wants to turn over a "new leaf" in the often 
troubled relationship between the two countries.

IN SHANGHAI, CHINA ROUNDS UP MORE DISSIDENTS BEFORE FRENCH LEADER'S VISIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 China rounded up dissidents in Shanghai in advance of a visit Saturday by 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. France's foreign minister denounced the 
arrests as becoming "out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 police took Shanghai activist Bao Ge from his home Saturday morning, 
pushing and hitting him when he refused to leave, friends said. Police gave no 
reason for detaining him and showed no warrant, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, police picked up another dissident, Wang Fuchen, from his 
apartment. He had not returned home Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 China has been under increasing pressure from the West to improve its human 
rights conditions, but the Beijing government has resisted. Dissidents also 
were detained in advance of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington on Saturday, the White House called on Chinese officials to 
immediately release dissidents incarcerated "for the peaceful expression of 
their views." 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly support the right of these advocates of peaceful change to 
exercise their internationally recognized human rights," Press Secretary Dee 
Dee Myers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers expressed concern about China's reluctance to provide information about 
the status and location of detainees. She said the human rights issues are "of 
crucial importance" to the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also criticized the detentions. "That's 
enough," he said angrily after arriving in Shanghai. "It's starting to get out 
of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 He later said Chinese authorities had "assured us there have been no arrests 
of dissidents in the past few hours."

WAR THREATENS RWANDA'S GORILLAS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A British veterinarian and others who care for mountain gorillas in 
strife-torn Rwanda must abandon their posts, leaving the endangered animals to 
the mercy of poachers, an official at the Morris Animal Foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a potential tragedy for the rest of the world," Robert Hilsenroth, 
executive director of the foundation, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the decision was made Friday to abandon a clinic at the Volcanoes 
National Park and a research center that are under the auspices of the 
foundation and an affiliate group, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups support research and medical programs at the park and the Karisoke 
Research Center. Fossey, a scientist who devoted herself to saving gorillas in 
Rwanda, was murdered in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only 651 of the majestic apes worldwide, 331 of them in Rwanda 50 
miles north of the capital city, Kigali, where battles are raging.

WINNIE MANDELA SUBJECT OF ANC FRAUD INVESTIGATION IN S. AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The African National Congress said Saturday that it is investigating fraud 
charges against Winnie Mandela, estranged wife of ANC leader Nelson Mandela and 
a likely member of South Africa's first all-race Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, including misappropriation of U.S. donations to the ANC, were 
revealed in a newspaper report on a secret internal ANC inquiry into Mrs. 
Mandela's management of its welfare department. 
</P>
<P>
 She was dismissed as head of the Social Welfare Department in May, 1992, amid 
allegations of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Mandela, who is 31st on the ANC's list of candidates for the April 26-28 
election of South Africa's first democratic Parliament, was convicted as an 
accomplice to kidnaping and assault of children in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cape Times newspaper said it obtained a copy of the secret report of an 
ANC commission of inquiry into Mrs. Mandela's affairs between January and March 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the report covered her management of the ANC's Social Welfare 
Department between February, 1991, and March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations in the report include: 
</P>
<P>
 * That Mrs. Mandela and her companion and deputy, Dali Mpofu, failed to 
declare or deposit donations received during a visit to the United States in 
1991. The total value of the donations was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 * That she deposited a donation of $135,000 into her personal account, 
subsequently transferring only $115,000 to the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 * That withdrawals from the welfare department account totaling $58,000 by 
Mandela and Mpofu were not adequately documented. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are investigating the charges . . . but an investigation is a process and 
not an event. I cannot say how long the investigation will take," ANC spokesman 
Ronnie Mampoepa said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that Mrs. Mandela had refused to testify before the commission 
but had acknowledged that she owes the ANC $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC officials confirmed Saturday that Mrs. Mandela has not returned any money 
to the organization.

U.N. RENEWS THREAT OF AIR STRIKES AS SERBS ADVANCE; BALKANS: REBELS CAPTURE 
STRATEGIC GROUND OVERLOOKING GORAZDE. CEASE-FIRE TALKS BREAK DOWN AMID 
REJECTION OF MEDIATORS' DEMANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations renewed threats Saturday to launch air strikes against 
Bosnian Serbs after the nationalist rebels conquered the most strategic high 
ground around the besieged eastern town of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions also heightened after talks aimed at wresting a cease-fire out of the 
warring factions broke down when Serbs rejected Western mediators' demands that 
they pull back from Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb assault and capture of the commanding Gradina heights 
overlooking the trapped Muslim community of 65,000 was waged under cover of a 
24-hour truce designed to improve the atmosphere at negotiations. It clearly 
angered British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander for Bosnia, who 
arranged the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali demanded that Serbian 
forces withdraw to positions they held before the Gorazde offensive that began 
nearly two weeks ago and said "all available means" could be used by U.N. 
troops to push them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't exclude any measures, and air strikes are included," said Therese 
Gastaut, Boutros-Ghali's spokeswoman in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO commanders meeting in Naples, Italy, confirmed that they are prepared to 
intervene with air power should the U.N. peacekeeping force in the Balkans, 
UNPROFOR, request it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the threat of North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes against 
Serbian rebel artillery encircling Sarajevo that halted the deadly bombardment 
of this battered capital two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and other Western powers had appeared reluctant to issue 
similar warnings to protect Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe area" that has 
never been accorded a protective deployment of troops. Only 13 U.N. military 
personnel are stationed in the region; all but four arrived in the last two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensified Serbian incursion into Gorazde on Friday seemed to have 
spurred the tougher U.N. position. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian forces used tanks and artillery to seize the Gradina promontory, said 
U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink, describing the assault as "a major advance." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bosnian Serb army has the initiative and military dominance, but we do 
not think Gorazde is under imminent threat of being taken because it is 
strongly defended and because we do not believe the Serbs actually want to take 
the town," Annink said. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. officials had earlier said that the Serbs were unprepared to take the 
Gradina heights. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few foreign aid agencies in Gorazde, the Paris-based Doctors 
Without Borders, contradicted the U.N. assessment, saying in a statement that 
it feared the pocket was at risk of being overrun. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the U.N. military observers recently dispatched to Gorazde have suggested 
in confidential communiques that the seriousness of the Serbian assault is 
being understated by U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 85 people, mostly Muslim civilians, have been killed during the 
offensive and more than 400 have been wounded, said U.N. refugee agency 
spokesman Kris Janowski. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sarajevo, cease-fire talks between the rival military commanders with Rose 
and U.S. special envoy Charles Redman became deadlocked and broke off. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian army commander Gen. Rasim Delic blamed the breakdown on the Bosnian 
Serb military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who refused to withdraw from land 
seized around Gorazde and sought to freeze the territorial status quo as the 
basis for U.N. troop deployments. Serbs now control 70% of Bosnian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "In principle, nothing has been agreed. Gorazde is still under attack," Delic 
said. "Now it is up to UNPROFOR and Mr. Redman to find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Mladic, in turn, accused the Bosnian government of scuttling a truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted in our agreement the permanent and complete cessation of 
hostilities, which is far more than what was offered by the opposite party," 
Mladic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediators cast the deadlock as an opportunity for "reflection" on a 
proposed plan to call a two-week halt to the fighting while diplomats work out 
the terms of an overall settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some political assurances still have to be made, and both sides have gone 
back to consult with their political authorities," Rose said as he emerged from 
nearly five hours of fruitless discussions, his arms clenched anxiously across 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman said the Bosnian factions are drawing closer than ever to a common view 
of how this war-ravaged country should be pacified but noted that the 
government and the Serbs remain in disagreement over the timing, duration and 
scope of any cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown underscored the growing complexity of the Bosnian conflict, in 
which strengthening government forces are unwilling to give up the military 
option to recover land lost to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is also wary of Western promises that a fair deal will be 
concluded if they leave the ethnic partitioning to be worked out through 
negotiations instead of on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 2-year-old war that has killed more than 200,000 people, the 
United States and its allies have denounced Bosnian Serb aggression in U.N. 
Security Council statements but done little to deter it.

 The rock music world Saturday mourned the suicide of Kurt Cobain, the troubled 
lead singer of the grunge band Nirvana, whose anguished lyrics gave voice to a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain, 27, who was at his Seattle home after leaving a California drug 
rehabilitation facility, died of a shotgun wound to the head, according to a 
statement from the county medical examiner.His body was identified by 
fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've classified it as a suicide," said Seattle police spokeswoman Vinette 
Tichi. "We won't be investigating." 
</P>
<P>
 A steady stream of Nirvana fans and the curious trickled through a small park 
next to Cobain's home, peering through a fence to see the garage apartment 
where the musician's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and private security guards were posted around the 90-year-old home in 
an exclusive Seattle neighborhood, allowing selected friends and family members 
to pass the plastic yellow police tape.

TEAMSTERS BREAK OFF TALKS ON TRUCKERS' STRIKE

<P>
 Talks aimed at scaling back a nationwide trucking strike broke down Saturday 
and the Teamsters Union accused major trucking companies of muzzling smaller 
ones that had sought interim pacts with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of 18 small trucking firms had come to the union's 
headquarters in Washington after Trucking Management Inc., the umbrella group 
that represents the industry in contract talks, released them to seek interim 
agreements that would have ended the strike against them. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a brief meeting, the Teamsters broke off the talks and issued a 
statement accusing TMI of placing a "gag order" on the companies that barred 
them from discussing their views about TMI's bargaining positions. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI President Arthur Bunte accused the union of trying to "deceive the public 
and their members."

HOURS AFTER SHUTTLE LAUNCH, VITAL RADAR TEST HITS SNAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the prime experiments on the shuttle Endeavour's Earth-monitoring 
mission ran into trouble Saturday just hours after the craft's dawn liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-power amplifier for one of two radar instruments aboard Endeavour 
wouldn't work, and researchers had to pass up viewing opportunities.Ground 
controllers spent several hours struggling with the problem before activating 
the amplifier in a manual mode. The amplifier is vital because it powers the 
radar's antenna. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Control told the crew that the flight would be extended from nine to 
10 days, thanks to their efforts at power conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers continued to study the amplifier trouble and late Saturday night, 
after numerous tests, began scanning Earth with the radar. 
</P>
<P>
 While that radar was down, the other radar took its first images as Endeavour 
flew over Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment is supposed to be the most advanced space radar ever built for 
civilian use. The mission is meant to provide the most extensive monitoring of 
Earth's environment ever made from orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of the mission is to see how well the radar works. Scientists 
will compare the radar images of Earth to thousands of photographs to be taken 
by the six astronauts and the results of on-the-spot surveys by research teams. 
</P>
<P>
 After two launch delays last week, the 4.5-million-pound shuttle thundered 
from its seaside pad right on time at 4:05 a.m. PDT.

CLINTON SHIFTS HIS FOCUS TO CRIME THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton shifted his focus to crime Saturday after a weeklong health 
care sales trip, saying the nation can't resolve other big problems until it 
deals with "the overwhelming force of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 With Republicans and Democrats in Congress blaming one another for failing to 
act, Clinton told Americans in his weekly radio address: "For six long years 
we've waited for a comprehensive crime law.We shouldn't have to wait any 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress returns from its spring break this week, with crime legislation high 
on the House agenda. The Senate passed its version of crime legislation 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton wants a bill to, among other things, put 100,000 more police officers 
on the streets, deny parole to criminals convicted three times of violent 
offenses and set up boot camp disciplinary programs for young first-time 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican response to Clinton's radio address provided a glimpse of the 
partisan wrangling over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Susan Molinari of New York said Democrats "continue to emphasize social 
programs that do little to impact crime immediately" when the nation should 
"stop focusing on criminals as the victims of society and begin focusing on 
helping the victims of crime."

<TEXT>
<P>
 A justice on Pennsylvania's Supreme Court was convicted in Pittsburgh of two 
counts of conspiracy and acquitted of violating drug laws by having a doctor 
issue prescriptions for him in his employees' names.Justice Rolf Larsen, who 
had been next in line for the chief justice's position, gasped when he heard 
the verdict but showed no other reaction. He faces a maximum sentence of three 
years in prison and a $10,000 fine on each count. Larsen testified he has taken 
tranquilizers and anti-depression drugs for a decade. He said he asked a doctor 
to prescribe the drugs in his court employees' names to avoid the stigma 
attached to mental illness.

 A government audit said the U.S. Navy has caused serious pollution in its 50 
years of operations at the Argentia naval base in Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit said investigators found petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, PCBs 
and organic contaminants around the hazardous waste building and landfills on 
the base. The report added that the United States must clean it up before they 
shut the base Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. has held authority over the site since 1941 and according to the

<P>
 Thousands of federal workers last week took advantage of the first 
governmentwide attempt to reduce its work force by offering employees buyouts, 
some of them worth $25,000. The Transportation Department, for example, had 
received 1,800 applications by week's end. Under the legislation signed by 
President Clinton on March 30, departments and agencies can offer buyouts to 
employees who resign or retire early between now and March 31, 1995.

FRIENDS HELP HOMELESS N.Y. COUPLE HAVE A REAL WEDDING AND HONEYMOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They almost didn't get their marriage license because the bride had no photo 
I.D. The wedding gown was a borrowed prom dress. And their friends took up a 
collection for a honeymoon night in a real hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But being homeless didn't stop Lucy Diane Dickerson and John Doster from tying 
the knot Saturday, proving again that home is where the heart is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're sweet together," said Wendy Fox, one of about 75 guests -- 
most of them homeless -- who attended the ceremony at a drop-in center in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride, 49, wore a pink lace-and-satin gown borrowed from a center 
employee. The groom, 53, wore a donated suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifts included a Section 8 city housing form, wrapped in shiny paper with 
a bow. Doster's caseworker, Jim Kwiecinski, said the city's Emergency 
Assistance Unit had promised to come through with an apartment in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The groom's brother, John Caserta, said Doster had been homeless much of his 
life and that he met the bride at a bus station after she arrived from Atlanta 
in 1992.

TWO TEENS IN VAN ARRESTED AFTER 3-COUNTY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two youths who apparently tried to steal a minivan were arrested after leading 
police on a chase across three counties and finally crashing the vehicle in 
Anaheim early Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers first tried to stop the driver of the minivan in Riverside 
County about 3 a.m. Officers pursued the teen-agers into San Bernardino County 
and back to Riverside before they sped west to Anaheim, where Anaheim police 
officers assisted in the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths drove as fast as 90 m.p.h. on city streets, Anaheim Police Sgt. 
Mike Zigmund said. They allegedly tried to ram Anaheim police cars twice before 
crashing near State College Boulevard and the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 When the youths got out of the van and ran, officers began a short pursuit. 
Both teen-agers were caught and arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon -- a vehicle -- and evading police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the youths had a bloodied lip, which police attributed to the crash. 
Because both are juveniles, their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers are not sure why the youths fled from police, but the van's ignition 
area appeared to be damaged, leading authorities to believe the van was stolen. 
However, its owner has not yet reported it missing.

INSURERS, GOVERNMENT ATTACK MENTAL HEALTH FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A popular though unscientific estimate is that one-tenth of the nation's 
$800-billion annual health budget gets skimmed off by crooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody claims to know how much of the toll goes to psychiatric scams, but 
industry and government have begun showing a new aggressiveness toward 
suspected mental health fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, 600 federal agents blitzed 20 offices of National Medical 
Enterprises across the country, searching for evidence in a massive criminal 
probe of the Santa Monica-based hospital chain. The ongoing investigation is 
said to center on allegations of illegal patient recruitment and false billings 
and diagnoses, mainly in the company's psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical, the target of more than 100 lawsuits alleging overtreatment, 
filing false claims and other transgressions, last month struck a final 
agreement to sell most of its psychiatric facilities to rival Charter Medical 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Blue Cross of California, most large insurance companies now have their 
own health fraud units, whose investigators try to identify and plug holes in 
their defenses against scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Because health plans often have annual caps on inpatient psychiatric benefits, 
some unscrupulous operators treat chronic illness with one eye on the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 One program under scrutiny by Aetna Health Plans flies depression patients to 
a clinic in Mexico for therapy that includes horseback riding. The treatment 
seems to cure the problem for a year, investigator James Garcia said, "but it's 
a recurring type of illness, so you need to keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The mental health community is apprehensive that fraud and abuse are 
undermining support for appropriate psychiatric care and threatening to erode 
the gains that advocates have made in winning acceptance for legitimate 
treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by rising costs, many employers have slashed the number of days of 
inpatient mental health care that their health plans provide. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the cap is high or low, "there's a temptation to treat people till 
the benefits run out and then declare them cured," said Jacque J. Sokolov, a 
Los Angeles physician and managed-care consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokolov believes in holding psychiatric treatment to the same results-oriented 
standards as any other kind of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronni B. MacLaren, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles involved in the 
National Medical Enterprises and A Place for Us investigations, said mental 
health is ripe for fraud for two reasons: Overhead is low because operators do 
not need expensive equipment, and diagnosis remains relatively subjective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychiatrists don't have a fractured bone they can point to," MacLaren said. 
"They're talking about a mental state."

GARAMENDI'S 1991 SEIZURE OF EXECUTIVE LIFE CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mel Fuchs, a Newport Beach real estate broker, used to go out of his way to 
boost John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave Garamendi $750 in his race for insurance commissioner, and even 
traveled to Garamendi's ranch near the tiny Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta 
town of Thornton for Garamendi's annual barbecue and fund-raiser in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But not anymore. Fuchs soured on Garamendi when, four months after taking 
office in 1991, the insurance commissioner declared Executive Life Insurance 
Co. insolvent and seized it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very good-looking guy, very nice," Fuchs said. "Got all the attributes 
and ego to be President of the United States, and that's what he's going for." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Life was among the state's largest life insurance companies. It also 
was among the largest single investors in high-risk junk bonds sold by Michael 
Milken and his defunct Drexel, Burnham, Lambert. When the junk bond market 
collapsed in 1989, Executive Life posted huge losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, Garamendi sold the remnants of Executive Life to a group 
that included a former partner at Drexel, Burnham and the French bank, Credit 
Lyonnais, for $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the deal was a boon for the new owners. In a March cover 
story critical of Garamendi's handling of Executive Life, Forbes magazine 
estimated Executive Life's portfolio has appreciated by $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi defends his decisions. Neither he nor anyone else could have 
anticipated that the junk bond market would rebound, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decisions we made were applauded at that time by Mel (Fuchs) and others," 
Garamendi said. Garamendi said 90% of the more than 330,000 policyholders got 
or will get all of their money -- a figure hotly disputed by many 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs, 73, is among those whose benefits were cut by half. He had hoped to use 
his life insurance policy with Executive Life for retirement and thought it 
would be worth $1 million. In the end, he said, he will end up with what he put 
in, about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing stinks," Fuchs said. "But I'm the lucky one. Others lost 
everything. It's a horror story what happened to the people. They're older 
people. They can't get insurance any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Another who lost was Wallace Albertson, a West Los Angeles Democratic activist 
who had annuities managed by Executive Life. Albertson enlisted Maureen Marr, a 
political and consumer activist, to take up the policyholders' cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Marr combed Garamendi's campaign finance reports, and found more than $100,000 
in donations to Garamendi since 1991 from law offices, accountants and other 
experts hired by the Department of Insurance to oversee the seizure and sale of 
Executive Life, and related litigation -- a figure confirmed by a Times review 
of the records. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show that those firms have received $94 million in fees in the 
Executive Life case. The money came from the assets of the insurance company. 
Albertson and Marr contend that much of that money should go to the 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was curious to see if there was a financial motivation for his actions," 
Marr said, explaining why she undertook the laborious task. "Whether it's 
$1,000 or $100,000, these kinds of associations are pretty outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Stern, Garamendi's spokeswoman, said campaign donations had nothing to 
do with the decision to hire experts in the Executive Life case. "The 
relationships were established based on expertise and experience in the area of 
conservation and liquidations of insurance companies."

4 FIRMS JOIN BREAST IMPLANT CASE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly $500 million was added to a record-breaking settlement aimed at 
resolving thousands of lawsuits filed by women who contend that they were 
injured by silicone gel breast implants, as four more corporations joined the 
deal, according to sources close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional money brings the total settlement fund to slightly more than 
$4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 3M agreed to put in $325 million, Union Carbide, $138 million, McGhan Medical 
Corp., $25 million and Wilshire Foam, $8 million. Their contributions were 
hammered out in negotiations conducted in New York and Birmingham, Ala., which 
concluded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 All the major manufacturers of breast implants have now joined the settlement, 
although some makers of the foam and silicone gel that went into implants have 
not settled and will remain the subject of individual lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the three leading suppliers of breast implants -- Dow Corning 
Corp., Baxter Healthcare Corp. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, agreed to put $3.75 
billion into the settlement. U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. of 
Birmingham, Ala., who is supervising thousands of breast implant cases, 
provisionally approved the settlement last week.

FASTER THAN A SPEEDING BULLET; HIGH-SPEED TRAINS ARE JAPAN'S PRIDE, SUBJECT OF 
DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toru Fukushima still recalls the pride he felt when, as a high school student 
during the golden autumn of 1964, Tokyo was host to the Olympics and the 
soon-to-be-famous bullet train made its first high-speed runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullet train and the Olympic Games together were symbols of Japan's 
economic growth," said Fukushima, now a planning official with Central Japan 
Railway Co. "I sent my friends New Year's cards with pictures of the bullet 
train. And I received many cards from my friends with its design. It 
represented the hopes of the Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
 While the bullet train is no longer the world's fastest -- that honor now 
belongs to the French Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) -- Japan's love for speed on 
rails is still intense. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation is making a multibillion-dollar gamble on developing ever faster 
and ever more technically advanced trains that would improve service at home 
and, it is hoped, generate business abroad. Work is moving forward both on 
speeding up conventional bullet trains and on building futuristic levitation 
trains that will float above the tracks via electromagnetic power. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the advanced, in-service model of the bullet train, Nozomi , has been 
engulfed in controversy since it was launched two years ago. Some critics say 
the risks in Japan's aggressive development of faster trains -- in terms of 
both finances and safety -- outweigh the potential benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite questions about the wisdom of this massive investment, it is clearly 
producing technical progress. And, with the Clinton Administration showing 
interest in high-speed rail, Japanese rail technology soon may be finding its 
way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnetic levitation (or "maglev") train technology is one area the United 
States and Japan cited as offering potential for research collaboration in a 
broad agreement signed in February by the U.S. Department of Transportation and 
Japan's Ministry of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that the U.S. government is most interested in 
superconductivity" for use in maglev trains, said Norio Mitsuya, director of 
international economic affairs at the Ministry of Transportation. "Maybe the 
Japanese government can help." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan also "certainly will be ready" to cooperate in the upgrading of Amtrak's 
Washington-New York-Boston (Northeast corridor) service, if the United States 
requests such participation, Mitsuya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Japanese rail technology also may figure in U.S. efforts to find 
commercial ventures for military contractors as procurement budgets shrink. For 
example, Grumman Corp. -- which agreed last week to be acquired by Los 
Angeles-based Northrop Corp. -- has conferred with a Japanese firm about 
building a relatively simple maglev train for moderate-speed service in U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential markets for advanced train technology also beckon in countries such 
as South Korea, Taiwan and China. The main international competition so far has 
pitted the bullet train against France's TGV and Germany's Intercity Express 
(ICE). South Korea has chosen the TGV over the bullet train for a planned 
Seoul-Pusan route. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese engineers did feasibility studies in the United States about a decade 
ago, during an earlier wave of U.S. interest in high-speed trains. They looked 
at prospects for a Los Angeles-San Diego line and at projects in Florida and in 
the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conclusions -- based partly on their own experiences getting around the 
United States -- were not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the Northeast corridor, high-speed rail projects in the United 
States are not (commercially) feasible, we think," said Fukushima, whose 
company operates the bullet train service between Tokyo and Osaka. "Americans 
like to travel by airplane and rental cars. Many engineers who visited the 
United States know the convenience of this combination." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese interest in finding overseas customers for rail technology is based 
not only on the money to be made, but also very much on national prestige, 
Fukushima said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have pride that the initial high-speed train was inaugurated in Japan," he 
said. "We have pride that our system encouraged European railways that 
high-speed rail would be possible. Thirty years ago, other countries were very 
pessimistic about the future of rail. We have pride in the " 
</P>
<P>
 While skeptics say prestige has played too big a role in the never-ending 
quest for greater speed, Japan is aggressively pushing forward on four major 
technical fronts: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Nozomi, which runs at speeds up to 168 m.p.h., was launched in 1992. 
Service has not been trouble-free, however, and technicians are striving to 
resolve a variety of problems, many of them related to loose or weak bolts. 
Critics say that government-owned Central Japan Railway, creator of the Nozomi, 
rushed the light-weight, aluminum-body train into service without sufficient 
testing -- a charge the company denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Test runs are being conducted on the next generation of high-speed bullet 
trains, based on the same basic design as the Nozomi. One of these prototypes, 
the STAR 21, set a new Japanese speed record of 265 m.p.h. in a December test 
run. That made it second in the world to France's TGV, which has been clocked 
at 319 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 * Central Japan Railway is developing a futuristic maglev train that hovers 
about four inches above the rails. This train depends on powerful 
superconducting electromagnets, which function only when cooled to very low 
temperatures by liquid helium. The United States is interested in this 
technology, although there is great uncertainty about its practicality for rail 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 A prototype, made of plastic, was destroyed in 1991 by a fire touched off by a 
flat tire. Another prototype, made of aluminum, has achieved speeds of up to 
262 m.p.h. on a four-mile test track over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction is under way on an 11-mile maglev test track that could become 
part of a super-high-speed Tokyo-Osaka route on which maglev trains would 
travel as fast as 300 m.p.h., but some residents along the proposed route have 
fought bitterly against giving up their land. Critics also charge that the 
train's strong magnetic fields may pose a public health risk -- and that the $3 
billion already committed to the project will never be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * New efforts are being made to put into commercial service a relatively 
simple form of maglev train, called High Speed Surface Transport (HSST). 
Variations of this system carried more than 1.5 million riders at expositions 
in Japan during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 This train hovers about half an inch above its track, suspended by 
conventional electromagnetic power. Appropriate for use within urban areas, it 
runs at speeds up to about 70 m.p.h. The technology is not controversial, but 
it has never been used commercially. Long Island, N.Y.-based Grumman has 
discussed cooperation in this technology with Japan's HSST Development Co., 
created last year by 48 Japanese companies that wanted to promote its use. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to market conventional bullet-train technology based on the Nozomi 
model are headed by the Japan High Speed Rail Consortium, which includes more 
than 30 large corporations under the leadership of two trading companies, 
Mitsui & Co. Ltd. and Nissho Iwai Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, controversy dogs the Nozo mi, the fastest train in everyday use. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it went into service, Japanese newspapers have carried dozens of reports 
about loose bolts, stones kicked up, cracked windows and other mechanical 
failures. The harshest criticism is that the Nozo mi, with 37 trains in 
operation, runs a higher risk of derailment than the slower -- but thoroughly 
proven -- Kodama and Hikari versions of the bullet train. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of the French TGV, three derailments in the past 16 months, 
shows that high-speed rail accidents indeed can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The first TGV derailment was caused by a broken axle, the second by the 
collapse of a covered World War I trench under the rail line and the third by 
colliding with a bumper that had fallen off a freight train. The TGV has 
special, jointed wheel sections and carriages tightly linked to form a single 
"backbone." The design enabled the entire train to remain upright in all three 
derailments, so serious injury to passengers was avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 While Japan's bullet train has never been derailed -- earlier models have 
functioned largely free of mechanical troubles -- the Nozomi has endured a 
seemingly endless string of embarrassing incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, visiting Chinese Railway Minister Han Zhubin was stuck on the 
Nozomi for nearly three hours due to a power outage. While top Japanese railway 
officials waited at the next station to welcome the Chinese delegation, 45 
other trains were canceled or delayed, affecting 45,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier incident, a four-foot-long exterior part fell off the Nozomi as 
it headed into a Tokyo depot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the train were going full speed and that part came loose and hit people, 
it would be terrible. People would die right away," said Keiichi Namba, 43, a 
Nozomi maintenance worker who is a leader of the Central Japan Railway Workers 
Union, a relatively small, left-leaning group that has spearheaded criticism of 
the Nozomi.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the Nozomi's most prominent critics is Kiyoshi Sakurai, an author with 
a doctorate in nuclear physics who, in recent years, has specialized in writing 
about the risks and problems of high technology. Sakurai presented a sharp 
critique of the Nozomi in a book published last year, "The Day the Myth of 
Bullet Train Safety Collapses." 
</P>
<P>
 His basic argument is that -- compared to previous bullet trains -- the Nozomi 
has been redesigned and lightened in ways that make it less likely to withstand 
the stress of vibration encountered at higher speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, the train's central axles were solid metal in previous 
models, but are now hollow tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a case of extreme vibration, the train could crack apart and derail. 
That's one scenario," he said. "Another scenario is that if bolts come loose, 
the big and extremely heavy motor could fall onto the unprotected spinning 
axle, cut into it, break it and cause a derailment." 
</P>
<P>
 The rail agency's managers acknowledge that all the bad publicity about the 
Nozomi has not been helpful to overseas sales efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also point out that bullet trains, including the Nozomi, have carried 
more than 3.4 billion passengers -- an average of 27 trips for every person in 
Japan -- without an accident that caused passenger injury. The Nozomi suffers 
only routine start-up problems that pose no risk to this enviable record, 
management insists. 
</P>
<P>
 "After actually using the train at high speed, there were places where the 
stress was greater than we expected," Akira Isozaki, head of technical research 
and development at Central Japan Railway, acknowledged in an interview. "So 
there are some places where it has proven necessary to put on thicker bolts, or 
more bolts. But it's not a matter of the train itself having been weakened by 
being made lighter. . . . The great majority of these problems are extremely 
insignificant things that have no impact on how the Nozomi runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of the Nozomi stems partly from the high standards set by a nation 
that has made bullet trains a part of its culture, according to Fukushima. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you see some of the calendars in Japan, for April you see the picture of 
the Nozomi running . . . with cherry blossoms in full bloom and Mt. Fuji 
covered with snow in the background," he noted. "I think this is very typical." 
</P>
<P>
 When the TGV derailed in December -- the incident involving the World War I 
trench, Fukushima said -- a French newspaper ran a headline emphasizing that 
because of the train's special design, it had not overturned. If such an 
incident happened in Japan, there would never be such a positive spin on the 
story, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, "People would say, 'Why didn't you find the big trench?' " 
</P>
<P>
 While some passengers express dissatisfaction with the Nozomi, complaining 
that it shakes too much because of its speed, many others are happy with the 
fast service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take the Nozomi because the ride is shorter," said Haruo Fukuda, a 
businessman who was about to return from Tokyo to Hiroshima on a Nozomi. "I 
don't care about the troubles. Machines cannot avoid having troubles. I don't 
think they'll cause an accident." 
</P>

 Times researcher Chiaki Kitada in Tokyo contributed to this report.

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE INFORMATION MONOLITH IS BECOMING A MOSAIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lessons in business, technology and law, plus a glimpse of a new pattern for 
industry, were all contained in news events last week as a federal judge 
questioned American Telephone & Telegraph's acquisition of McCaw Cellular and a 
big venture between a telephone and a cable company fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, misunderstanding reigned, thanks partly to the bleating of 
business people that the government was out to hamstring new information 
industries with regulation. The stock prices of AT&T, McCaw and Southwestern 
Bell -- which broke off a $4.9-billion venture with Cox Cable Communications -- 
fell on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 But shrewder analysis would have painted a different picture. The 
Southwestern-Cox deal, like the recently canceled merger of Bell Atlantic and 
Tele-Communications Inc., fell apart because it didn't make sense to begin 
with. The telephone company will be better off. 
</P>
<P>
 And Judge Harold Greene's questioning of the AT&T-McCaw marriage may result 
ultimately in total deregulation of the telephone business with local phone 
companies allowed into long-distance and AT&T, MCI, Sprint and all sorts of 
other firms allowed into local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues are important for consumers, investors, business people and just 
about everybody. So before getting lost in detail, we should step back to see a 
pattern.  
</P>
<P>
 Far from regulating to limit industry, the Federal Communications Commission, 
with backing from Congress and the White House, wants to bring thousands of 
companies into a new and open competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The result in the next few years will be a free-for-all, with a multitude of 
communications carriers offering voice, data and video services over ground 
lines and wireless systems and from satellites in space. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC will auction rights for wireless personal communications systems later 
this year, allowing up to seven carriers in each locality. They will compete 
with at least two cellular phone firms, two specialized mobile radio 
communicators and anybody else with an innovative idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's actions reflect a departure from policies favoring big companies 
that have guided industrial thinking for most of the 20th Century. We set up 
the old AT&T as a monopoly in the early 1900s, for example, because only a big 
company could marshal the forces needed to deliver services at low prices to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we believe that competition, among hundreds of companies small and large, 
is needed to give us lower prices and innovation. "If America is to develop a 
world class information superhighway, we must promote healthy competition at 
home," Vice President Al Gore has said. White House planners are looking at 
estimates that the proposed National Information Infrastructure will add $25 
billion a year to total U.S. output. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors are coming forward eagerly. A good example is Celsat Inc., a small 
firm in Gardena, that has just filed for an FCC license on a satellite system 
that promises cellular phone calls at "less than a penny a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 David Otten, its founder and president, is an electrical engineer who worked 
27 years for TRW's space systems. He says Celsat will be able to transmit 
low-power signals that can be picked up because of special features on its 
satellite that were developed years ago for the military. 
</P>
<P>
 That sophisticated and expensive technology, which only the military could 
afford to use, has now become available at civilian prices because of advances 
in microprocessors and other computer chips, Otten explains. "There are more 
circuits on a chip," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are a multitude of small high-tech companies developing new 
solutions, says William Davidson, a USC professor and consultant with Mesa 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualcomm Inc., of San Diego, for example has developed chips and switches 
allowing low-power signals to be picked up from the atmosphere by ordinary 
cellular telephones and newer personal communication devices. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the microchip that really is driving the changes in communications and 
other industries. The pace of change is incredibly fast: The capabilities of 
chips -- the number of circuits on each sliver -- doubles every 18 months. So 
old ways of doing business no longer cut it. Big mergers, which once created 
economies of scale, now create only mastodons. 
</P>
<P>
 In their way, both events of last week reflected new competitive realities. 
AT&T, seeking to acquire McCaw, was looking for a waiver from Judge Greene's 
original judgment that broke up the old Ma Bell in 1984. But Ma Bell's 
offspring, the regional Bell operating companies (Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, 
BellSouth, Nynex, Pacific Bell, Southwestern Bell and U S West) wanted waivers 
in return allowing them into AT&T's long-distance business. Judge Greene,in 
acceding to regional Bell wishes that he refuse AT&T a waiver, may have set in 
motion a process that will end all restrictions on telephone competition. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Southwestern-Cox venture broke up because the Bell companies now 
realize they don't gain much by simply giving their capital to cable operators, 
notes Peter Bernstein, editor of "Wireless" a new trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensible phone ventures thus far involve investments in companies offering 
a look at different businesses. U S West's investment in Time Warner, and 
Nynex's investment in Viacom, for example, give them access to movies and 
television show content, for whatever future possibilities they may envision. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, if the well-heeled Bells want to expand into other territories, 
they'd do better if they used their money not for mergers and acquisitions but 
to form linkages with the many small, innovative firms the FCC is encouraging 
to enter the business. 
</P>
<P>
 For, as was hinted by events last week, numbers and diversity will 
characterize the communications industry of the future. National networks may 
well be built not by colossal corporations but by linkages among many companies 
in different locales across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am large, I contain multitudes," Walt Whitman wrote of America in the last 
century. Now government policy and technological reality say the same will be 
true of America's major industries in the next century.

FACTORIES REVEL IN NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION; MANUFACTURING: SPENDING ON 
HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT IS DRIVING A BREATHLESS EXPANSION. BUT WHAT'S GROWING IS 
PRODUCTIVITY, NOT JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The factory floor is clean -- and surprisingly quiet. Only a handful of men 
tinker with huge machines destined for other plants that will turn metal into 
automobiles, appliances and construction equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Giddings & Lewis, America's biggest producer of machine tools, the 
factory is a window on a revolution in U.S. manufacturing -- and the peculiar 
nature of the nation's robust economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy industry is pouring money into advanced equipment such as Giddings' 
automated machine tools. Capital spending on equipment increased 16.2% in 1993, 
driving the kind of breathless economic growth not seen in nearly a decade -- 
growth that has policy makers and the financial markets worried that the 
economy is overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, American manufacturers, who just 10 years ago evoked images of 
inefficiency and obsolescence, are enjoying a revival. But, unlike in past 
expansions, they are not meeting demand by putting up new factories or opening 
shuttered ones. Nor are they hiring many more workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are reconfiguring plants, adopting lean manufacturing techniques 
and buying automated, versatile equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers are looking to do more with less," said Stephen Peterson, 
Giddings vice president of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as three years ago, the Giddings plant here, in a blue-collar 
suburb northeast of Detroit, employed 1,200 people. Today, there are fewer than 
half that many, but the smaller work force is shipping almost as many automated 
machine tools out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real growth . . . is coming from productivity driven by capital spending," 
said David Littman, chief economist of Comerica, a Detroit-based bank holding 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Littman's conservative estimate is that capital spending will rise 13% this 
year. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that companies are increasing 
investment in plants and equipment to the highest level in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason: The average age of metalworking machinery in U.S. plants is 10 
years, older than at any time since 1941. To remain competitive, factories 
simply must replace aging equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is thriving, of course. Aerospace and other defense industries 
are reeling from cuts in the Pentagon budget. California and the Northeast, 
with manufacturing bases much more reliant on military contracts, have not felt 
the expansion as much as the Midwest and the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete flip-flop from a decade ago," said Diane Swonk, economist for 
First Chicago National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference from 10 years ago: This expansion has been a feeble 
producer of jobs, particularly in manufacturing. Overall, employment decreased 
in 1991 and 1992 and grew only 1.6% last year. The Commerce Department 
estimates that half of the 120 manufacturing industries expected to show growth 
in sales this year will also cut employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of no similar period when there has been such a reluctance to add 
employment to meet demand," Littman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Layoffs by major employers continue; an estimated 186,000 jobs were cut by big 
companies in the first nine weeks of the year. The firings are concentrated 
among companies that are still restructuring, embracing new technology or 
facing stiff price competition, as in the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the remaking of manufacturing may be laying the groundwork for more jobs 
and a stronger economy in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Painful as the process is, productivity already has drastically improved. The 
Labor Department reported this month that the productivity of U.S. workers -- 
output per hour worked -- was improving at the fastest rate in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Such gains have been made possible by the so-called re-engineering of U.S. 
factories. Many plants have cut costs and work force. They have adopted lean 
production principles that emphasize quality, shorten manufacturing time and 
reduce inventory. They have learned how computers and other high-tech 
communications can make them more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a technology revolution in manufacturing," Swonk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers have been aided by several other factors: a resurgence of 
consumer confidence that is creating demand, low interest rates that have 
reduced the cost of capital (though rates now are going up) and a weak dollar 
and lower trade barriers that make exporting easier. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry is leading the improvement in the manufacturing sector -- 
and adding jobs for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 14 million vehicles were sold in the United States last year, up 8% 
from 1992. Growth has continued at a brisk pace through the first three months 
of this year, with sales of 15 million cars and trucks projected for 1994. For 
the first time in 14 years, the United States is likely to produce more 
vehicles than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with sales and production strong, however, the auto makers are not 
opening new plants. Instead, they are increasing output by eliminating 
production bottlenecks, redesigning assembly lines to make them more efficient 
and adding third shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler, for instance, recently announced it will spend $1.8 billion over 
three years to increase assembly plant output 17%. The company will also 
upgrade engine facilities, including a $120-million investment for new 
equipment to build 100,000 minivan engines at its Trenton, Mich., factory. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 3 auto maker is doing all this without building any new plants, 
although it is keeping a St. Louis plant open that was previously slated for 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we don't want is to get stuck with too much capacity," said Dennis 
Pawley, executive vice president of manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new investments could result in 6,000 new jobs, as Chrysler adds new 
equipment and third shifts at existing plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company hiring is Caterpillar, the Peoria, Ill.-based maker of 
construction equipment. Strong demand for its earth-moving equipment has been 
spurred by highway repair projects and other major construction undertakings. 
</P>
<P>
 In three announcements since November, Caterpillar has declared its intentions 
to hire 1,000 factory workers. Some new hires will replace workers who retired, 
but most are needed to meet higher than expected demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1991, Caterpillar had 10% too many workers," Swonk said. "Now it is 
calling back workers in record numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummins Engines of Columbia, Ind., is also operating on all cylinders. The 
producer of heavy-duty diesel engines for trucks has enjoyed strong profits for 
the past two years, after a difficult restructuring in the '80s. Industry-wide, 
the backlogged demand for tractor-trailer engines is a record 120,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising demand for autos, trucks, appliances and construction equipment has 
boosted the machine tool business as well -- the critical industry that builds 
the machines that make all other machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Today machine tools are the nation's fastest-growing manufacturing sector, 
according to the Commerce Department -- a remarkable turnaround for a business 
devastated by foreign competition in the 1980s. More than 900 of 1,400 U.S. 
machine toolmakers have disappeared since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors, leaner and wiser, enjoyed a 32% increase in machine tool orders 
and a 13% rise in shipments in 1993. Last year, the United States surpassed 
Germany as the world's largest consumer of machine tools, a trend expected to 
continue through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 One thriving machine toolmaker is Newcor Inc. of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The 
company, which makes specialty machines and precision parts for the auto and 
appliance industries, has enjoyed three years of record revenue and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 At its Wilson Automation plant in nearby Warren, Newcor recently completed a 
$40-million automated assembly system for installation at Ford Motor Co.'s 
engine plant in Cleveland. The computerized system is being used to make Ford's 
new V-6 engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcor's high-tech bent is evident in the makeup of its 250-member work force 
in Warren: 170 of the employees are engineers who spend most of their time 
working on computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcor works closely with customers, typically forming teams early in a 
project to help design, engineer and build a system. The emphasis is on 
flexibility -- having a machine perform more than one function with little 
retooling -- and eliminating downtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, a machine would be up 65% of the time," said Richard Parkes, 
manager of new product sales at Wilson Automation. "Today that is 85% to 90% of 
the time. And we are striving for 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Just three miles north, the effort to build better machine tools is under way 
at a Giddings & Lewis plant. The company, based in Fond du Lac, Wis., 
exemplifies the renaissance of the U.S. machine tool industry more than any 
other manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Giddings was losing money as a unit of Amca International of Canada. 
William Fife, a turnaround specialist brought in to revive the unit, 
implemented a strategy aimed at broadening Giddings' base beyond its 
traditional Big Three auto customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fife took the company public in 1989. In 1991, he made his boldest move -- 
acquiring Cross & Trecker, a company twice Giddings' size, for $107 million. 
The purchase allowed Giddings, a specialist in high-end automated systems, to 
expand into less costly machines and gain entry into Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Giddings aggressively cut costs, cut Cross' staff and developed new products 
by merging the expertise of the two companies. Productivity almost doubled. The 
result: steadily higher sales and hefty profits. Last year, the company earned 
$43 million on sales of $517 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fraser, a team of Giddings engineers is working with Chrysler to design 
manufacturing solutions to reduce production time for a 1998 replacement for 
the car maker's LH-model sedans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have targets here to shrink the manufacturing time," said plant manager Ed 
Schenk, who has spent 25 years in the manufacturing trenches. "It's a 
competitive advantage to be faster."

FIRST PERSON: BOUND TO THE RING OF SATURN OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given my past wheels -- a '68 bug and a gas-thrifty Honda Civic CRX -- I don't 
exactly qualify as a Car Person. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before I found myself seemingly driven by an occult hand into the 
arms of the Saturn sales team leader at the Beach Boulevard dealership. That's 
what we call them. Team leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I have joined the Cult of Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two others in my office, but we've been spreading the word, 
recruiting others in and out of our company bureaus. We three have the same 
color car -- teal green -- although that is coincidence. Two of us share a 
secret Saturn salute as we pass in the hallway. All of us have been converted 
into car lovers from who-cares drivers happy so long as the stereo speakers and 
air conditioner work. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning I received my personal invitation to Homeward Bound, a 
weekend hoedown in Spring Hill, Tenn., that Saturn is throwing for every Saturn 
owner in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Like alien abductees, we Saturn drivers are being summoned to an empty 
hayfield late in June to listen to Wynonna Judd and pore over accessories and 
demonstration models. They'll tell The Saturn Story, of course. Our story. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, we'll be bused to the original Saturn plant for tours of the assembly 
line that delivered our SCIIs. There is a fee of $34 for adults, $17 per child, 
and I admit I'm not sure if this covers food and open bar. It appears to 
include day-care Camp Saturn for 3- to 12-year-olds and evening entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 If I lived in the same state, I'd probably check "I will attend the Saturn 
Homecoming and would like a Saturn Homecoming Customer Service Representative 
to call me to make travel arrangements." And "I would like a Saturn Homecoming 
Customer Service Representative to call me to arrange my hotel accommodations." 
The hayfield will be made wheelchair accessible, and those with hearing or 
vision problems will be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
 I get it my way for $34? I hope they bring this show to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was high time we did something to show how much we appreciate 
our relationship with our customers," my invite says. "So here it is: We'd like 
to have you all over for the weekend. . . . We're doing this to give you the 
chance to meet the people who made your car, see the factory and the town where 
it was built, and experience firsthand what Saturn is all about -- and why it 
is having such an impact on so many people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't I know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, I remember my first Saturn encounter like it was yesterday. My sales 
consultant Cathy was like a birthing coach -- soothing, funny, there for me, 
man. No heavy pressure. No dickering over alloy wheels being thrown in and let 
me check with my sales manager on that price. 
</P>
<P>
 When I signed the contract, I had to wait weeks for my arrival into the Saturn 
circle. But hey, who wants to join a club that is easy to get in, right? By the 
time my $15,000 investment in my future arrived and I was given the keys, I 
looked like I had won an Academy Award instead of a vehicle that mostly 
delivers me to and from my desk job. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, as I turned the ignition, thunderous applause surrounded me. It was 
my Saturn kin, circling its newest family member. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like I had found religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "How you likin' your Saturn?" my office cult brother asked soon after my 
baptism in July. He smiled with a satisfied look. "Oh," I blurted happily, "it 
is just great ! " I hadn't gushed like this since Springsteen played the Sports 
Arena in '81. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the guy who is convinced fellow Saturn drivers yield to him at 
four-way stops, as a matter of car bonding. "Once I was trying to get on a 
packed 91 Freeway when another Saturn owner let me in, giving me a big wave," 
he said, and he was not even smirking. "Another time, a Saturn identical to 
mine was pulling out of a gas station driveway onto the street I was driving 
on. The female driver honked and waved, like I was a long-lost buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days ago, my winter edition of Visions -- "published for Saturn owners, 
Team Members and their families," the masthead reads -- arrived at my office. I 
was ecstatic. I am not only a member of the Saturn family but a member of an 
enviro-friendly family! My club newsletter, as it were, is printed on recycled 
paper with soy, linseed and cottonseed oil inks on white paper stock that's 
half wastepaper and 10% "post-consumer waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Does this cancel out my exhaust emissions?

JUNIOR NAGS; KIDS ARE ALL OVER THEIR PARENTS TO QUIT KILLING THEMSELVES WITH 
CIGARETTES. THE PRESSURE IS ON FOR ADULTS TO DO AS THEY SAY, REPORT O.C. 
TEACHERS AND FORMER SMOKERS.

 Craig Stubbs, a Westminster contractor, was a two-pack-a-day smoker, but he 
had no cigarette lighted when his young son walked into his office at home. "I 
would always try to hide smoking from him," Stubbs recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next changed Stubbs' life. 
</P>
<P>
 His son Ben, not yet 5 years old, asked for his father's attention. When he 
was sure he had it, he spoke "with a genuine seriousness and a staunch 
resolve," his father recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a confrontation. "He said, 'Quit smoking; it's bad for you.' He said 
smoking is incredibly damaging and I was not going to have the privilege of 
enjoying him if I kept this up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was startled," Stubbs says. "It was quite a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 So what did Stubbs do? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I quit. Right then. I did not smoke again. I'd tried to quit several 
times before, but this time I didn't go back." 
</P>
<P>
 He felt guilty, says his wife, Ember. "He just felt terrible and had to quit. 
Ben is not a kid of many words, but what he does say means quite a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 His father has been off tobacco for nearly eight years, but Ben Stubbs, now 
12, is still worried about smoking. Last year he drew an anti-smoking poster 
that won a contest run by Orange County's cancer, heart and lung associations. 
The design has been printed on 30,000 textbook covers that were distributed to 
all Orange County sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ben's anti-smoking bent is hardly unique. He's one of a generation of kids 
targeted years ago by anti-smoking forces to become the Smoke-Free Class of 
2000. Each year since kindergarten, they have received anti-smoking lectures 
and materials in school to stiffen them against pressures to smoke during 
adolescence, the time when most smokers start. 
</P>
<P>
 Success or failure is still several years off, but the byproduct has already 
surfaced: a corps of youthful tobacco rangers taking the anti-smoking assault 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for parents who smoke, the most feared question is not "How did the baby 
get in there?" It's, "If smoking is bad for me, why do you do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have always nagged their parents about this," says Keith Pendell, a La 
Habra High School teacher who designs anti-smoking programs nationwide. "I used 
to hound my dad to quit. Then I started and he got on my case. 
</P>
<P>
 "But these kids now know the harmful effects of smoking more so then we did. 
We grew up with dancing cigarettes on TV. It wasn't really a health issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the tobacco rangers can be seen in smoking-cessation classes 
countywide. Adults seeking help for alcoholism or obesity rarely report 
pressure from their school-age children, authorities say. But between 50% and 
75% of adults in no-smoking classes say they enrolled because their children 
pressured them, according to local instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children are afraid they are going to be abandoned because of awareness 
of what tobacco is going to do to their parents," Pendell says. "It's a very 
important motivation for parents to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Stubbs, throw in the towel immediately. "I only had one 
cigarette after that -- a Salem. But I'd just been shot in a hunting accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Others try to bob and weave and encounter a sometimes extraordinary 
persistence. "I've heard people say their kids hide their (parents') 
cigarettes," said Donna Gordon, a former smoker who conducts a quit-smoking 
class at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. "My kids would break my cigarettes. 
That's pretty common." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents say they'll quit, then smoke outside the house, regardless of the 
weather, says Rita Freese of Orange, another no-smoking instructor. "They feel 
kind of stupid doing it, but they do it. They don't want to smoke in front of 
their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, the reversal of roles is so complete that parents genuinely 
fear being caught smoking by their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife smokes, OK?" says Jim, a respiratory therapist from Orange County who 
would rather not give his surname. 
</P>
<P>
 "And my son (age 14), little by little he starts getting really, really upset: 
'I can't stand the smoke,' 'I know you're smoking in the morning; I can smell 
it in my room,' 'You better quit; you're gonna get cancer and die and leave me, 
and if I ever see you smoke another cigarette I'm gonna run away from home.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He's genuinely upset. His grandfather died who he was really close to, and 
his grandmother died. And then his uncle died. Any more deaths in the family 
would be real, real hard for him to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "So my wife would cough once in a while, and he'd say, 'You're coughing! You 
have cancer!' She did have a chronic cough, and I was concerned about that. But 
you can't tell your wife, 'You can't do that anymore.' She'd just laugh. I 
didn't say anything about it. I let him do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did, relentlessly, Jim says. She would go outside and smoke, not out of 
consideration but because "she didn't want any more (talk) from my son. She 
just basically got to the point where she had to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been hard but she has been successful so far, Jim says. Even so, "as 
soon as she comes home from work, he checks her out. He smells her breath."  
</P>
<P>
 For harassed smoking parents, there is a dark side and a bright side to this, 
says Dr. Justin D. Call, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the UC 
Irvine College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark side: "There's another group of kids afraid to bring up the subject, 
even though they're upset. They don't say a word. Their fear stems from 
embarrassing or depreciating their parents, because they've heard their parents 
depreciate these (anti-smoking) efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 The bright side: "If your kid's on your case, be happy he's well-adjusted. The 
more mature parents should tell their children they're glad to hear they 
understand, and they hope they never take up smoking because it's certainly a 
burden on them. This does not destroy their authority with the child. Kids 
should be complimented for their sound judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 What is at work, Call says, is genuine fear. Children begin talking about the 
concept of death as early as age 5, "but they don't start understanding it 
until about 10 years of age. So around that time, when death has a sense of 
finality, they become quite concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Children talk about such things among themselves, Call says. But at this age, 
they think "categorically rather than theoretically. That is, they hear a 
single bad story about someone dying of cancer because of smoking, and that's 
all the proof they need to become very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 As adolescents, about half of them will be capable of making fine 
distinctions, such as heavy smoking being more dangerous than occasional 
smoking. But until then, it's simple: 
</P>
<P>
 Mommy + Cigarettes = Dead Mommy. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to this is the authority of the teacher, who is "their expert on the 
outside world." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting. Children of doctors should realize their parents know more 
than their teachers about the human body and disease and procreation. But many 
of them don't believe it until the teacher says so." 
</P>
<P>
 So when the powerful smoking-is-dangerous message comes from such authority, 
it might as well be chiseled onto stone tablets. 
</P>
<P>
 Adele Quenzler, a volunteer for the local American Cancer Society unit, 
remembers lecturing a class of elementary school pupils in Garden Grove, "and 
they were so attentive and receptive. They were really alarmed and wanted more 
information: 'What can we do? Where are the classes?' They were not ill at ease 
with the subject at all." 
</P>
<P>
 And so an assault on the evil habit that threatens their parents with death is 
a logical and natural result, Call says. With so much at stake in the 
children's eyes, parents should not be surprised by their urgency and 
persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unhealthy to wage a persistent campaign at home about this. This is 
not a sign of neurotic difficulty in the child. The child is only objecting to 
what the parents are denying, the dangers of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he approaches in a reasonable, consistent and persistent way, you know his 
knowledge is sound and secure and also based in sympathy and understanding of 
addiction. You know that his thinking about the problem is really advanced. He 
understands something about the problem and the addiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that often these tobacco rangers, after hectoring their parents 
into giving up the weed, begin smoking in adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more complicated," Call says. "There is a peer group to deal with. 
And smoking is a valuable asset for many adolescents who want to assert their 
independence in a purely symbolic way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some adolescents may still be unable to visualize abstract issues. If so, they 
literally cannot imagine the bad effects of smoking applying to them until they 
actually happen. "They can smoke, but they can also deny that it affects them 
personally," Call says. "They can disregard all the consequences for them. " 
Some remain in this mode of thinking for life. 
</P>
<P>
 But until then, many are soldiers of the cause, and an amazing number are 
successful, says Sal Garcia, coordinator of tobacco education for the Garden 
Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the sixth grade, they've gotten the message, and they carry it to the 
parents for us. Kids get hard to deal with about then. That, plus they're 
hassling you to quit smoking? Imagine it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Jim doesn't have to imagine it. The smoke of battle between his son and wife 
has cleared, but the war apparently isn't over. "He started hitting on us 
because he didn't like the smell of coffee in the morning. I said, 'Hey, too 
bad. Close your door, man, because that's not gonna stop.' What is this?"

JIM MURRAY: THE MASTERS; SUDDENLY, THIS UNKNOWN IS A RATHER POPULAR GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thursday afternoon, just after he had shot a 70 to take his place among the 
leaders of the tournament, the Masters press officers brought a player named 
Tom Lehman to the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed a pleasant-enough fellow. Nice smile. Balding on top. Friendly sort. 
Looked a little bit like a school bus driver. 
</P>
<P>
 But the interview room quickly emptied when he sat down. Reporters rushed to 
their phones. They had more important news to bring to the waiting world.  
</P>
<P>
 You see, Lehman was following Greg Norman and Corey Pavin to the room, and 
those were hard acts to follow. There was standing room only when they were 
there -- an overflow really for Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman was no Norman. Norman is the sport's "Great White Shark," an 
international celebrity, a man who has won two British Opens and dozens of 
other tournaments and is generally conceded to be the best player on the planet 
these days.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lehman couldn't match that glamour. Tom Lehman has never won a PGA Tour 
event. He wasn't the Great-White-Anything. Only a corporal's guard of media 
types hung around for his interview. They didn't know what to ask him. One guy 
actually said, "Tom who?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Tom Who almost makes Who's Who as of Saturday night at the Masters. The 
Great White Nothing beat the Great White Shark by six shots on Saturday's round 
to lead the Masters going into the final round with a one-shot lead over Jose 
Maria Olazabal -- and a six-shot lead over Norman and some of the other big 
names of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 When he came in for an interview Saturday, the room was packed. The guys 
fought to get in their questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Who is this upstart who dares to rout the flower of world golf, who challenges 
the course where Hogan, Nicklaus and Palmer ruled, the citadel of American 
golf, whose proudest boast is that it has never been won by a Tom Lehman but 
has always been taken by the royalty of the game? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, first of all, he's a religious man. He's probably the first guy ever to 
lead the Masters going into Sunday who will spend Sunday morning giving a 
sermon. He's a dues-paying member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  
</P>
<P>
 A preacher leading the Masters? A guy who struggled for three years on the 
tour, then didn't even qualify to play from 1986-91? 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the Masters. That's one of those other tournaments. "Unknown wins 
Masters" is not in standing type like other major tournaments. No Tom Who has 
ever won it. Tom Watson, probably. You don't win the Masters unless you know 
every blade of grass at Augusta and which way the greens break and when to lay 
up and when to go for it. It takes, conservatively four years for a guy to even 
survive this hall of horrors, never mind lead it.  
</P>
<P>
 Take a look at it. It's diabolical. It's like the innocent-appearing choirboy 
who ends up an ax murderer.  
</P>
<P>
 There's not a spot of rough on it. Sometimes, U.S. Open courses are all rough. 
The only way to get a bad lie at the Masters is behind a tree. It's so 
innocent-looking, you want to give it a lollipop.  
</P>
<P>
 The Masters has these deceptively benign greens. They look like grass but putt 
like glass. They have slopes. Example: On Thursday, on the ninth hole, Arnold 
Palmer hit a ball only a couple of yards short of the green. Arnold chose to 
putt it. He had about 40 feet. The putt ran up 35 feet, stopped, and began to 
roll backward like a runaway truck on the Grapevine. It came to rest five yards 
behind where Arnold had initially putted it. He was putting for birdie on his 
third shot -- and chipping for a par on his fourth shot. In a sense, he had hit 
the ball backward.  
</P>
<P>
 That's Augusta. It's not a course, it's a torture chamber. After three holes 
on it, you'd confess to anything.  
</P>
<P>
 Look at what it does to the marquee players. Payne Stewart, who won a U.S. 
Open and a PGA, shoots 78-78. Hale Irwin won three U.S. Opens, but he shoots a 
79 Saturday. Only three players broke 70 the first day, only six the second and 
only two the third. Sandy Lyle, a former winner, shoots a 78 the third round, 
John Daly shoots a 77. So does another former winner, Ian Woosnam.  
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of this shot and shell stands the unlikely figure of Tom Lehman, 
Bible and putter in hand, faith in place. Lehman was so bad, he lost his tour 
card -- which he had worked years to get -- in mid-career, so discouraged that 
he weighed taking a coaching job at the University of Minnesota. He thought at 
least he could go to Florida and golf in the winter, but the school said he'd 
have to run the ski-rental shop. Tom went back to his golf clubs.  
</P>
<P>
 Lehman doesn't know what the fuss is all about. After all, he has played the 
Dakotas' tour, the Carolina tour, the South Africa. He won four times on the 
Hogan Tour, which is a satellite tour for the luckless players who could not 
get their tour card at the qualifying tournament. "Of course, that's not quite 
the Masters," concedes Lehman.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Masters may look like a faithless trollop to some elite 
players. But to Lehman, she's been almost flirtatious. Last year, in his first 
trip to Augusta, he ended up tied for third.  
</P>
<P>
 Hardly anybody noticed.  
</P>
<P>
 They noticed this week. He was on television more than David Letterman. And, 
when he came to the press interview room Saturday night, you would have thought 
it was a Streisand concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Some great players have been trying all their lives to win the Masters -- Greg 
Norman, Tom Kite, Lee Trevino, among them.  
</P>
<P>
 To make the Masters your first tournament victory is like winning a lottery 
with your first ticket.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the old girl hasn't thrown her hand in yet. She has led people on 
before. Eventually, she turns to her tried and true swains, the ones who know 
her moods. She hates to be taken for granted. She'll hit you over the head with 
an 80. She drowned a shark Saturday. Lehman could go back to being What's His 
Name again by tonight if he takes too many liberties.

MIKE DOWNEY: SANTA ANITA DERBY; HE'S LUCKY, HE'S GOING TO KENTUCKY 
</P>

 Randy Winick is a man with Ran and Win built into his name. So you could say 
he was born to race. He trains thoroughbred horses for a living, just as his 
father did. He is currently the trainer of Brocco, who ran to win in Saturday's 
Santa Anita Derby with such authority and beauty, it is not inconceivable that 
his horse will be the favorite to do likewise in the Kentucky Derby next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about the Kentucky Derby recently, Winick said it wasn't that big a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 After the race Saturday, he laughed at himself and said, "Well, talk is 
cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, as any trainer can tell you, racing means waiting. And waiting. 
Randy Winick has not even been to a Kentucky Derby for 22 years, or half his 
lifetime. Last time he attended one, on May 6, 1972, it was because a horse 
called Hold Your Peace, trained by his father, Arnold Winick, was going off as 
the 7-to-2 second choice behind favored Riva Ridge, and he could picture 
himself in the winner's circle, of legal age to be poured some champagne. Alas, 
the winner was, indeed, Riva Ridge, with the Winicks settling for third place 
and wondering which year would be their year. 
</P>
<P>
 Either you learn how to pace yourself or you don't. Randy Winick knows how. He 
is a Chicago Cub fan who hasn't been to a game at Wrigley Field in so long, "I 
remember Ernie Banks was at shortstop." Growing up on the North Side and in 
suburban Glenview, he always told himself that the year of years could be just 
around the next corner. In the meantime, though, Winick watched others do all 
the winning. 
</P>
<P>
 He even says, "Now that I look back on it, half the fun was watching Warren 
Spahn or Lew Burdette or Red Schoendienst come to play. The best players were 
the ones on the other team." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't keep him from wearing a Cub cap around the barns, though. And 
besides, training horses for an owner, Albert R. Broccoli, who is better known 
by the nickname Cubby, what could be more fitting? The home team has to win 
sometime, doesn't it? Holy cow, this could be the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've always dreamed of," Winick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a Derby horse? 
</P>
<P>
 "Any Derby. I've never had a Derby horse, Kentucky or Santa Anita or any kind 
of Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco is a lot of horse. He won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile race last 
November, establishing himself as a horse to reckon with in Kentucky once he 
had that third birthday. He outran Dehere. He was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came a setback or two. Brocco's training schedule got, well, 
off-schedule. He fell short in the Hollywood Futurity by half a length. Then he 
lost some training hours in December because of rain. He had some muscle 
strains in January. He went nearly three months without a race and ran second 
again upon his return. Twice he ran and twice he failed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 If he failed Saturday, what would people say? 
</P>
<P>
 Winick could guess. Here he was, up against the best trainers in the business, 
Charlie Whittingham, Wayne Lukas, but people expected his horse to win. They 
were betting at 3-to-5 odds he would win. There was a lot of pressure on Randy 
Winick to win, even though there probably shouldn't have been. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched the race anxiously, with his father also among those viewing. Randy 
said later, "Maybe the rumors can be put to bed that there's something wrong 
with this horse. There's nothing wrong, as you can see. He did exactly what we 
thought he could do. Everything's running right on schedule. We always said we 
wanted to peak at precisely this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this race was hardly what it was cracked up to be. Valiant Nature 
was withdrawn. Then, so was Soul Of The Matter. These were the horses that had 
beaten Brocco last two times out. What would a third defeat mean, particularly 
against a reduced field? 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, waiting was the key. Brocco's rider, Gary Stevens, had to be 
patient while a rabbit of a horse, Fly'n J. Bryan, bolted to the front. The 
early leader led by so much, some bettors must have feared that it was the L.A. 
Marathon all over again. Hard to trust those rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Then everyone ended up where he belonged. Brocco was the winner, Tabasco Cat 
ran a strong second and Fly'n J. Bryan ended up, well, dyin'. It was what the 
Racing Form might call racing to form. 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco is back on schedule. He is indeed Kentucky bound, leaving in a week to 
10 days. And Randy Winick says, "I'm as happy as I've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 He has himself a Derby horse at last.

SANTA ANITA DERBY; BIG BROCCO BEATS A SMALL FIELD; HORSE RACING: HE'S THE BEST 
OF SIX, DEFEATING TABASCO CAT AND STRODES CREEK IN A STRETCH DUEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Cubby Broccoli and his wife, Dana, bought this oversized 2-year-old and 
decided to call him Brocco, they bounced the name off their trainer, Randy 
Winick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brocco?" Winick said. "What kind of a name is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wins some races," Cubby Broccoli said, "then you'll know what kind of a 
name it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco was a winner the first time he got to the races, last summer at Del 
Mar, and he has done little else since. The chestnut colt's fourth victory in 
six starts came Saturday in the $500,000 Santa Anita Derby, and the 
three-quarter-length victory over Tabasco Cat will send the Broccolis and 
Winick to Churchill Downs with the favorite or second choice for the Kentucky 
Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't know who the favorite will be back there," Winick said. "Right 
now, I'm not worried about that. If Holy Bull ran big in the Blue Grass (next 
Saturday at Keeneland), I guess he could be the favorite. If my horse is the 
favorite, or the third or fourth choice, that's immaterial. Whatever price they 
make my horse, so be it. At any price, I think he'll have something to do with 
the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The 57th Santa Anita Derby wasn't what was advertised a week ago, and if the 
race had been run a day later, the attrition rate might have reduced the field 
to a match race. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, trainer Ron McAnally, whose Valiant Nature had handed Brocco one 
of his two defeats, in December's Hollywood Futurity, decided that his colt 
would be better off facing Holy Bull in the Blue Grass. Then Saturday morning, 
Soul Of The Matter, who won the San Felipe on March 20 as Brocco and Valiant 
Nature ran 2-3, was scratched because of a minor injury related to the cracked 
hoof that had bothered him earlier. The additional scratches of longshots 
Pollock's Luck, who has a fever and cough, and Wild Invader, who is going to 
run next Saturday in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, added up to a six-horse 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, more experienced than any of the other starters, was beaten for 
the fourth time in nine starts, finishing one length ahead of Strodes Creek, 
who had five lengths on his stablemate, Numerous. Robannier finished fifth, and 
Fly'n J. Bryan, the pacesetter who started to tire at the half-mile pole, was 
last. Favored Brocco paid $3.40 to win, earning $275,000 for running 1 1/8 
miles in 1:48 1/5, which was 1 1/5 seconds slower than the stakes record. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas, who trains Tabasco Cat, and Charlie Whittingham, the trainer of 
both Strodes Creek and Numerous, indicated that their horses would also run in 
the Kentucky Derby, which is an eighth of a mile longer than Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Winick made no apologies for not having Valiant Nature and Soul Of The Matter 
to beat Saturday. "We did what we had to do," the trainer said. "We had no 
control over the horses that weren't here." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens, one of the most successful jockeys to ride in the Santa Anita 
Derby, was aboard Brocco for the sixth consecutive time. In 10 tries, Stevens 
has never been worse than fourth in the stake. He has won the race four times, 
including last year with Personal Hope, and has added two seconds, one third 
and three fourths. The last jockey to win the Santa Anita Derby in successive 
years was Laffit Pincay, with Solar Salute and Sham in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens gave Brocco a canny ride, letting him settle into third place, behind 
Fly'n J. Bryan and Tabasco Cat. Brocco trailed by seven lengths after a 
half-mile and moved up steadily on the far turn. At the quarter pole, Tabasco 
Cat passed Fly'n J. Bryan, and even though he ran a gritty race, Brocco was 
able to overtake him with about a sixteenth of a mile left. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens hand rode Brocco to the wire. "Tabasco Cat hung in there a little 
longer than I anticipated," Stevens said. "When Pat (Day) popped his horse on 
the shoulder at the quarter pole and got no response at all, I thought I had 
them any time I wanted. When I went up and eyeballed Tabasco Cat, he kind of 
rebroke and made a horse race out of it until the sixteenth pole. Then I went 
ahead and asked my horse for his best. I never did use the stick (whip), 
because I didn't feel there was any need to. He was holding Tabasco Cat at bay, 
and there was nobody coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The filly Winning Colors, Stevens' first Santa Anita Derby winner, also won 
the Kentucky Derby in 1988, as they held off Day and Forty Niner by a neck at 
the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat lost for the first time as a 3-year-old, but Day wasn't 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big effort," Day said. "I was pleased with everything except the 
outcome. I would think that this race would set him up perfectly for Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek, making his first stakes appearance, now has two wins, a second 
and a third in four starts, all under Corey Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was the winner on the turn," Black said. "He kind of lost his 
momentum when we straightened for home. Changing (lead feet), he got all 
imbalanced, and that's when Brocco and Tabasco Cat really got away from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cubby Broccoli, the 85-year-old producer of many of the James Bond films, 
helped pick out Brocco at a 2-year-old sale at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked him because he was a huge horse," Broccoli said. "He was big, just 
enormous. He reminded (me) of some of the horses I used to watch at Del Mar, 
when I was around old-school chaps like Bing Crosby, Louie B. Mayer and Lin 
Howard. I was ill the day he won the Breeders' Cup (Juvenile), so this is a 
bigger thrill than that win. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best horse I've ever had, and it looks like he's on his way to 
bigger things. Should he be the favorite in Kentucky? That's not up to me. It's 
up to the people who have to make those judgments."

ANGELS MIGHT BE WITHOUT LANGSTON FOR SIX WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starter Mark Langston, the ace of the Angels' pitching staff, is tentatively 
scheduled to undergo surgery Tuesday on his left elbow. The early prognosis is 
that he will be sidelined four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, a four-time All-Star, was found to have bone chips and bone spurs in 
the elbow. He will be examined Monday by Dr. Lewis Yocum to determine the 
severity of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston was put on the 15-day disabled list for the first time since 1985. He 
will be replaced in the rotation by left-hander Brian Anderson, who was 
recalled from triple-A Vancouver and will start today against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. Anderson, 21, has appeared in only eight professional games, including 
one start in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a guy goes out in April, you don't say we're done," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said. "It's obvious we're going to miss him, but I don't 
think this is the time to give up the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who can shoulder the load, and now they'll have to shoulder it 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the first time in Langston's career that he faces the prospect of 
surgery. He has been on the disabled list only once before and is the only 
active major league player who has pitched at least 223 innings each of the 
last eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not scared, and I'm not discouraged," Langston said, "I just feel very 
disappointed because I wanted to go out there for the team. This just appeared 
out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels vow to survive the loss of Langston, but they still wonder how they 
can contend without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can say what we want, but you don't just replace a Mark Langston," starter 
Chuck Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to pursue a trade, using triple-A first baseman J.T. 
Snow as enticement. Veteran left-hander Joe Magrane, who currently is at the 
Angels' extended spring-training camp, could be ready to rejoin the club early 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who signed a three-year, $14-million contract in February, says his 
elbow did not bother him the entire spring. Nor did he feel any discomfort 
during his opening-day victory over Minnesota, yielding eight hits and two 
earned runs in 7 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston felt a sharp pain when he bumped his elbow against a chair Tuesday 
night, but shrugged it off. He lifted weights Wednesday afternoon, but when he 
played catch in the outfield with Finley, his elbow lost its mobility. He 
underwent tests Thursday morning by orthopedic consultant Dr. Daniel Buss, who 
made the diagnosis and relayed his findings to Yocum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was damage in there, but I don't know how much was new and how much was 
old," Buss said. "They're aware of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston tried to avoid the disabled list by pitching on the side Friday, and 
he felt little discomfort. But the elbow started to become inflamed, and Friday 
night he had no choice but to tell pitching coach Chuck Hernandez that he 
couldn't pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fortunate that I've had 11 years at this level and not had anything 
major happen," Langston said. "I'm still hoping this is very minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back."

FEHR BALL OR FOUL?; PLAYERS' UNION EXECUTIVE HEAD STAYS WITHIN STRICT 
GUIDELINES WHEN FORCED TO DEAL WITH BASEBALL'S INTRANSIGENT OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is late in spring training, and the man often characterized as the most 
powerful in baseball has the top down on his rental car, soaking up the Arizona 
rays as he marvels at the growth and development he sees when returning to the 
Valley of the Sun each spring. 
</P>
<P>
 It is growth similar to that of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. since 
Don Fehr became executive director in 1983, a span during which he has had to 
ward off repeated attempts by the owners to reduce and restrict player rights 
through collective bargaining and collusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr is now girding for another bargaining battle. The owners want to impose a 
salary cap that the union is unlikely to approve, and Fehr recently wound up a 
32-day tour of the spring camps in which he reviewed for the players a history 
of troubled negotiations with the owners, urged the need for solidarity and 
discussed the possibility of a strike in September, or as early as the All-Star 
break, if there is no settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The last month of the regular season represents the last leverage for the 
union before the start of the expanded playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike is the last resort, but it's hard to envision going into the 
off-season without protection against a declaration of impasse by the owners 
and the unilateral imposition of a new (economic) system," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be an absolute conflagration, but it may be what the owners want. 
We've heard rumors that some owners want to shut down the industry for a year 
and a half or more. How's that for acting in the fans' best interest? 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, that kind of talk is not about money but control, and I think that's 
what this is all about -- establishing who's in charge. Funny, I always thought 
that the owners' primary interest was winning baseball games." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny? No one has ever accused Fehr of being funny, at least not in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Bland? To a degree. Blunt? To a larger degree. 
</P>
<P>
 His is a humor wrapped in irony and acerbic wit. His is a skepticism born in 
the delusional decade of the '60s and hardened by too many battles with 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Antisocial and reclusive, as portrayed in a national magazine? Not entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Articulate and well-read? Definitely. 
</P>
<P>
 The most powerful man in baseball? "I don't know what that means," Fehr said. 
"I don't own anything. I'm not involved in the management of any clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where that comes from, I guess, is that the players have rights and I'm the 
person who stands up for those rights and says no to certain things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since there's no commissioner, the owners appear drifting and diffused, but 
the players don't. The players always present a united front. I'm the players' 
spokesman, so I appear to have more power than I do. That's where it comes 
from, but I don't take it seriously. I don't have much desire for publicity and 
notoriety. I know it's important for me to be recognized to the extent that I'm 
considered authoritative when speaking on the players' behalf, but the rest of 
it is nonsense. I'll be happy when I can slip into obscurity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The man who would choose obscurity finds his recreation in reading. Haunting 
bookstores, he says, is the best part of his spring tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr read the World Book Encyclopedia before he was 12, he said. He estimates 
that he reads 120 books a year, down from 150 because the demands of a job that 
requires more than 55 hours a week have become too great. Among the books in 
his Arizona hotel room are a science-fiction novel, a biography of the Roman 
emperor, Augustus, and a study of chaos and complexity theory, which could 
easily be a history of owner-player relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathematics. Music. Physics. Fehr has never met a subject that didn't interest 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be it reading or debating, Don has always been interested in how the world 
works," his brother, Steve, a Kansas City attorney and player agent, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fehr: "Interesting stuff if you're a weird person, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Weird? A touch of self-deprecating humor. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is certain: Fehr isn't into what he calls "meet and greet" social 
functions. It's only important, he said, that he knows his constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given my scintillating personality, it's a good thing I don't have to win the 
public relations battle," he said. "I'm often accused of being too blunt for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just never enjoyed social bantering for the sake of social bantering. 
I'd much prefer reading, spending time with my family or playing an instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I'm not easily given to broad smiles or ingratiating demeanor, but I 
don't think I'm reclusive. At least, I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
 A younger brother, Jerry, was a professional musician before going into 
wholesale jewelry. Fehr plays guitar a little and finds therapy, he said, in a 
digital piano that allows him to put on headphones and not disturb anyone in 
his Ryebrook, N.Y., home, where he lives with his wife, Stephanie, and his four 
children -- David, 19, a Kansas freshman; Mark, 15; Rachel, 11, and Elyse, 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, Stephanie said by phone, have been born amid several baseball 
crises. Mark, for instance, arrived during the 1981 players' strike. His father 
was gone for three months. Similarly, Fehr estimates that he has been home for 
only two or three of his and Stephanie's 23 wedding anniversaries. The 23rd was 
two weeks ago, and they were apart again. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Fehr would prefer spending those rare free hours at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don invests so much time in his job that people only see him in that 
context," Stephanie said. "He may appear reclusive and antisocial because of 
it, but that's not accurate. Don doesn't socialize with athletes or people in 
baseball, but we have many friends in a variety of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also believes that trust is vital to a relationship, so it takes him 
longer to develop one. He's definitely not a social animal, but he doesn't have 
the time for it even if he wanted to be. His priority is to his job and family, 
and around us he tells jokes, teases and reacts well to practical jokes. But 
not at work. People seldom see that side of him at work." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Fehr has encouraged his brother to develop a public sense of humor, 
providing him with jokes that elicit only a quizzical expression from Don. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a public standpoint, Don just isn't into the social BS," Steve Fehr 
said. "He doesn't suffer fools gladly. Never has, never will." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Steve Greenberg, the former deputy commissioner who has also worked with 
Fehr as an attorney-agent: "I don't think anyone would suggest that Don has a 
lot of charisma. He'll never make it in the Catskills as a stand-up comic, but 
that's not a criticism. It's just the way he is. He's also very thorough, 
analytical and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say his greatest strength as head of the union is his consistency. He 
avoids getting tripped up or undercutting himself in his message, and that 
takes a lot of discipline. People with a large constituency often get in 
trouble changing their message to suit the purpose of the person they're 
talking to, but Don doesn't do that. He's articulate, straightforward and well 
principled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't always like his principles when I was in the commissioner's office, 
but they were always well reasoned and consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 At 45, Fehr has been with the players' union as general counsel and executive 
director since 1977. His 17 years are one more than the tenure of the legendary 
Marvin Miller, credited with building the union into one of the nation's 
strongest. An obviously tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only has Don done it, but he's been widely praised in the process," 
associate general counsel Gene Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by free agency, arbitration and the owners' tendency to spend their 
national TV money as soon as they got it, the average major league salary has 
risen from $72,000 in 1977 to more than $1 million. The union's licensing 
revenue has risen from $2 million a year in 1981 to more than $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his many arbitration victories, Fehr gained a favorable verdict when 
management tried to impose mandatory drug testing, and his long fight against 
collusion resulted in a $280-million settlement -- before interest -- now being 
distributed to the victimized players. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, we stopped a really bad thing," he said of collusion. "If you 
can't have satisfaction over that, you can't have satisfaction over anything. 
If there wasn't a residual satisfaction to the job, I wouldn't do it. We put a 
lot of pride into our work and feel pretty good about the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr grew up in the Kansas City suburb of Prairie Village, Kan. He played 
Little League but was never obsessed with the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was distressed when Charlie Finley took the A's to Oakland, but not to the 
point that I couldn't find something else to listen to on the radio," he said. 
"I haven't been to a football game since 1972. I've never been competitive over 
things I don't consider important. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job, of course, has allowed me to develop an appreciation for the 
complexities of the game and the skill level needed to stay at the major league 
level, but I spend so much time dealing with the day-to-day problems that I 
just want to go home at night. I hesitate to go to the park much because it 
reminds me of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also difficult for me to be a fan because I'm involved with so many 
baseball people that I have to give up my rooting interest, and that takes a 
lot of the edge off. One of these years I'll be able to spend a summer at the 
park and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, although Fehr understands the importance of maintaining the 
romanticist's view as part of baseball's appeal, he cannot succumb to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not dealing with something abstract, a piece of art," he said. "I'm 
dealing with people's careers and futures, and that's complicated by the fact 
that they have only a limited time to make an appreciable amount of money. I 
can't afford to be a romanticist about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of his approach was shaped as a liberal-activist during the 1960s, when 
he attended Indiana University and later worked on the George McGovern campaign 
while attending the Missouri Kansas City law school. That was the decade of the 
King and Kennedy assassinations, the Kent State tragedy, the division over 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he saw the country polarized, unable to compromise and that he 
developed considerable respect for the individual and considerable skepticism 
in regard to the nature and motives of "monopolies and big business." 
</P>
<P>
 The impressions lingered, though it was fate that put him in position to 
exercise the skepticism as an officer of the players' union. His goal was to be 
a judge, and his first job out of law school was as a clerk for U.S. District 
Judge Elmo Hunter in Kansas City. He and Hunter still talk and exchange 
opinions, and Fehr still feels a tug when he thinks about how daily lives are 
affected in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Then and now he was also attracted to the challenge of trial law, and he went 
on to work for a Kansas City firm specializing in labor law. That firm was 
hired by the players' union in 1976 to handle the appeal of Andy Messersmith's 
free-agency case. 
</P>
<P>
 Messersmith, a pitcher with the Dodgers at the time, played the 1975 season 
without a contract to challenge the reserve clause in the standard contract. 
Arbitrator Peter Seitz ruled in Messersmith's favor, making him a free agent, 
and the owners appealed. As the local counsel working with Richard Moss, then 
general counsel of the union, Fehr helped sustain the historic ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that isn't the most famous case in baseball history it ought to be," Fehr 
said. "It enabled the players to achieve their market value, and it forced the 
owners to negotiate overdue changes in the reserve system." 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed by Fehr's work on the case, Miller asked him to become general 
counsel of the union in 1977, when Moss left to become a player agent. Miller 
retired in December 1982, and Kenneth Moffett, a former federal mediator, was 
hired to replace him. Moffett was fired 15 months later, however, for taking 
positions that the players believed were too conciliatory, and Fehr soon became 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the players of that era, there was always pressure to stand as tall as 
Marvin, but I never regarded it as a burden," Fehr said. "Marvin had a deserved 
reputation, and I never hesitated to seek his advice or keep him informed, 
particularly in the negotiations of 1985. I also asked Marvin to speak to the 
players who were in New York during the negotiations of 1990 on the historical 
perspective and importance of remaining unified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never agreed with everything Marvin says, but I still talk to him 
regularly, and of course, the players' perspective has changed with time. Most 
of the younger players don't know Marvin and aren't familiar with his 
accomplishments. It's valuable to educate them as to what he did."  
</P>
<P>
 Fehr continues to follow many of Miller's negotiating precepts -- Don't make 
proposals you intend to withdraw; don't say what you don't mean; make sure you 
do what your constituents want you to do because it's their future. Fehr said 
he can't allow himself to be influenced by public perceptions of player greed, 
nor does he believe that the style of the negotiators matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skill matters but not the style," he said. "Negotiations are driven by 
the desires of the constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his New York apartment, Miller said he has seen Fehr mature in his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "His dealing with problems, and his approaches to problems are all on the plus 
side," Miller said. "His handling of collusion was extremely important. On the 
one hand, he had to deal with the perjury of the owners. On the other, he had 
the frustration and anger of the players. It took time and skill to work that 
out, and he was up to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also said he thought the union is as strong as ever "but that doesn't 
cut ice" unless it continues to meet the challenge of owners who, every three 
or four years, "so under-assess the players that they think they can get away 
with anything." The salary cap, Miller said, is the latest "outrageous 
example." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have the anomaly of the owners asking a union whose purpose is to 
improve the wages of its constituents to join them in a conspiracy to hold down 
those wages," Miller said. "That's exactly what a salary cap is, an instrument 
for holding down wages. I'm sure the players will meet the challenge again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is against this backdrop of another potentially bitter labor dispute that 
the 1994 season has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The last seven bargaining negotiations have ended in either lockout or strike. 
Given that history and the memory of collusion, Fehr said, the union approaches 
the new talks with skepticism that is "a never-ending drumbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 He said each situation is viewed on its own but added: "I don't minimize the 
difficulty or likelihood" of the union's approving a salary cap that would 
limit wages, make it difficult for teams to improve and significantly modify 
free agency and arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr asks familiar questions: How can an industry with revenues of $1.7 
billion be in financial trouble? Why do the owners keep talking about a 
partnership with the players if the players are never consulted on major 
decisions? Why hasn't the union received a proposal more than 15 months after 
the owners voted to reopen negotiations? Why did the owners agree with 
negotiator Richard Ravitch's demand that they not join him at the table? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's disquieting," Fehr said. "If this is so important to the industry, 
shouldn't they want to participate? The lack of owner involvement means they 
don't want to hear for themselves. Ravitch even passed a rule to keep them out. 
What does he want to keep them from knowing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said Ravitch has been treating the owners' position with the secrecy of 
the Manhattan Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a year and a half, he's been telling us that he would explain the details 
of their revenue-sharing formula when it was passed, and now he says it's none 
of our business," Fehr said. "I mean, the only thing he's really told us is 
they need a new system because they can't afford another San Diego (referring 
to owner Tom Werner's alleged need to break up his team for financial reasons). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to say, 'Wait, we didn't pick the owner and we didn't pick the 
management.' Did any owners step in to help that situation or stop it? Clearly, 
it wasn't important enough for the owners to do something about, but they want 
the players' help in trying to prevent it. Maybe we should just buy the Padres 
and take it (the club) off their hands. Do you think they'd sell it to us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr shook his head and said he is troubled by the apparent lack of direction, 
the appearance of an industry adrift, the absence of a commissioner or chief 
executive officer around whom policy and planning revolves and who serves as a 
public relations focal point. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to interim commissioner Bud Selig's attempt to govern by committee, 
Fehr said, "There's a saying that a committee that designs racehorses comes out 
with camels." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the troubled relationship between owners and players and the 
likelihood it will not improve this year, Fehr said the product itself is too 
good not to survive and that he has no timetable for leaving his job. He is 
hopeful, he said, of helping professional baseball expand internationally and 
looks forward to an Olympic tournament, possibly even in Sydney in 2000, in 
which the majority of players are major leaguers representing their own 
countries. He is also hopeful of restructuring the amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much money is being wasted in the minor leagues," he said. "We should be 
pushing kids to college, subsidizing those programs and allowing them to play 
in professional summer leagues while they're still in school, the way an acting 
student is allowed to take roles in summer stock."

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES; THE BAGGY '90S; TODAY'S BASKETBALL UNIFORMS ARE TWO 
SIZES TOO BIG; THOUGH HIGH FASHION, THEY LACK A SENSE OF STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You hear it said in front of many television sets: The worst thing about 
basketball players today is their baggy uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sartorially, theirs is a world in which taut and trim have been abandoned as 
they proved during the NCAA tournament again this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the judgment of their critics, the athletes have created a kind of fashion 
-- basketball baggy -- that lacks a sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the nation's basketball players -- college and pro alike, women as 
well as men -- are making a fashion statement that can be termed a sweeping 
denial of style. 
</P>
<P>
 National reaction, predictably, has been divergent: 
</P>
<P>
 * An Establishment perception: Taste is out. Baggy's in, and that isn't all. 
Grunge is in, too. It's a big-city, teens-and-20s look: blacks, whites, 
Latinos. You see it at all the games, the parties, the restaurants. Nobody 
cares how they look anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 * A counterculture reply: They look like this because they do care how they 
look. They work at being sloppy. Rejecting middle America -- which they 
consider a closed society -- they reject, in the process, established notions 
of aesthetic appearance. And, in staking out their own territory, street kids 
and basketball heroes alike use their clothes as a form of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the first time that's happened. Those who feel oppressed often do odd 
things in protest movements. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a white group protesting what it considered unfair taxation put 
on Indian clothes and war paint 200 years ago and dumped British tea into 
Boston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 A difference on today's basketball courts is that the players aren't 
protesting that hard. What's more, in any balanced view, the way they perform 
has to be more important than the way they look. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a civilized society, shouldn't appearance count for something? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many decent citizens today are making an art form of sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
 In basketball, most noticeably, that's just what they think they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 75 or 80 years, the three-inch 
</P>
<P>
 inseam was standard for basketball shorts," Barney Wachtel, president of 
Russell Athletic Uniforms, said recently from Alexander City, Ala. "Then around 
(1990), the teams began asking for four inches, then six, then eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then in (1992) the University of Michigan called in an order for 10 inches. 
And it seems like almost every basketball player wants those floppy walking 
shorts now." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachtel doesn't presume to judge fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my rules is that I never rule anything out that I don't like," he 
said. "It's all right with me if they want to play basketball in oversized 
(jerseys) and billowy shorts that are at least two sizes too big." 
</P>
<P>
 So America has arrived at what some call the rejection era. On and off the 
court, a symbol of the times is the oversized, dress-down look. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stores, some costly, fashionable garments resemble the rumpled 
ensembles that have been in the attic since Grandma wore them to hard-times 
parties in the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 The country is in a coarsening mode that probably began on the streets, where, 
according to New York Times Fashion Director Claudia Payne, clothes designers 
get most of their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion trends have a way of moving off the streets and the rock stage to the 
runways," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 And on to the gymnasiums and arenas, where, in the estimation of many viewers, 
basketball baggy is more fashion than style. 
</P>
<P>
 A dictionary difference? 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion: "A way of dressing or behaving that conforms to a prevailing, often 
short-lived custom, use, or mode." 
</P>
<P>
 Style: "Good or approved fashion conveying a quality that gives distinctive 
excellence to forms of behavior or attire." 
</P>
<P>
 Such usage is inevitably subjective. But any way you cut it, the absent 
element in the baggy '90s -- nationwide -- is an enlightened sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
 The dividing line could be that pair of handsomely tailored new jeans over 
there -- the expensive pants that the manufacturer has deliberately ripped in 
both knees.  
</P>
<P>
 Distinctively excellent? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of few, a fashion-world consensus on the baggy '90s hasn't yet 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vogue magazine writers have persuasively condemned the look, many 
journalists are neutral -- at least on baggy sports gear. And Los Angeles Times 
Fashion Editor Mary Rourke has been supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to like (today's) basketball uniforms," she said. "It seems to me 
that they're closer to the real personalities of the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rourke sides with other experts on one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Baggy) is a fad," she said. "It will be out of fashion any minute." 
</P>
<P>
 From her New York Times office, Payne agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joy of fashion is variety," she said. "The baggy look won't last." 
</P>
<P>
 In basketball, though, it could be around awhile because 1990s players are so 
obviously in tune. 
</P>
<P>
 And, uniquely, they alone -- in the history of uniform wearers -- have been 
able to control the destiny of their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the military, in law enforcement, and most particularly in other sports, 
those who wear uniforms have traditionally had no say in their design. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan was the pioneer who changed all that, introducing baggy into 
sports -- perhaps inadvertently. In his days with the Chicago Bulls, wearing 
his North Carolina shorts under his NBA uniform as a demonstration of college 
loyalty, Jordan had to make room for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also think he was seeking another way to be different," said Amateur 
Athletic Foundation official Skip Stolley. "The one-piece uniform is next. In a 
couple of years, almost every male and female athlete in track and field will 
be in a one-piece suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, continuing as a clothes designer, might even bring the one-piece look 
to the NBA, where his former coach, Phil Jackson, had no objection the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 A laid-back intellectual, Jackson -- quite the opposite of Bob Knight -- could 
see that Jordan's appearance didn't really matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan took the long, long look into college ball for similar reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Steve Fisher succeeded Bill Frieder (as basketball coach), he wanted a 
changed look," said Michigan equipment manager Bob Bland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappily for connoisseurs of the sleek and svelte, he got it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sports uniform is comparatively new in athletics. For centuries, athletes 
competed in the nude. Even after uniform apparel had been designed for sailors, 
soldiers and policemen, team games were played in street clothes for years. 
</P>
<P>
 When sports entrepreneurs got around to it, however, their reasoning matched 
Napoleon's: Uniform clothing promotes pride in belonging as well as confidence 
in performing and a strong sense of unity with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniform itself is thus a weapon in the Marines, or basketball, or any 
other team sport. 
</P>
<P>
 A guest in any major league locker room before any game confronts the reality: 
The players, as they draw on their uniforms, undergo a transformation. One 
minute they are chattering youngsters, indistinguishable from any other bunch 
their age. An instant later, in the uniforms they have coveted since boyhood, 
standing taller, filled with major league pride, they are skilled combatants 
who are more athletically gifted than any other young group on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so they feel. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Hall of Famer Warren Spahn meant when, describing what he misses 
most about major league baseball, he said: "Just putting on the uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 On many basketball, baseball and football teams, that attitude in recent years 
has begun to clash with one that is wholly different but equally powerful. The 
players, as much as they value team membership, also wish to express their 
individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot more me-first guys today," veteran NFL defensive star Ronnie 
Lott said. "Carried too far, it can devastate a team." 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't happened yet, Lott said, noting that the Chicago Bears won the 
Super Bowl with a quarterback who, briefly, wore an advertisement on his 
headband. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Jim McMahon, who was disciplined, sort of, by Commissioner Pete 
Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the NFL, the most military of sports, the present commissioner, Paul 
Tagliabue, stamps out individuality by fining players who, for example, 
intentionally wear sagging socks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't stop that at the start, the (individualists) will take over," 
Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's sports, following the NBA's lead, they have taken over. Female 
athletes today wear three kinds of shorts -- baggy, high-cuts and traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the drastic differences in their three fashions, they give the 
same two reasons for wearing each: They're more comfortable, and they enhance 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball players, the ultimate team-playing individualists, also plead 
comfort and performance when asked about their baggies. 
</P>
<P>
 All such arguments tend to be less than persuasive. For years, athletic 
equipment engineers have required that the uniform move with the body. Baggy 
lags. If it doesn't retard performance, it is at least out of sync with the 
motion of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The real explanation for any popular look -- sports or otherwise -- is almost 
certainly the same in all instances: adherence to perceived high fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the baggy '90s, most of the time, you know what that is.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; DOES PENDLETON HAVE A BRAVE FUTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He joined the Atlanta Braves in 1991 and became one of the leading architects 
of the three consecutive division titles and 296 victories during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Pendleton helped stabilize the infield, provided leadership in the 
clubhouse, won the National League's most valuable player award in 1991, had a 
similar season in '92 and battled back from a struggling start last year to 
finish with numbers only slightly down from his two previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Ron Gant and Otis Nixon gone, with a new left fielder, center 
fielder, catcher and fifth starting pitcher, Pendleton wonders if he will be 
the next to go. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first week of the fourth and final year of that free-agent contract he 
signed in '91, having been rebuffed twice when inquiring about an extension 
while many of his teammates have been signed to multiyear contracts, Pendleton 
feels in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my future here is kind of cloudy," he said. "I'm kind of out there 
hanging. I wanted it resolved so I wouldn't have to go through a year like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to them after the '92 season, when I had two years left, and asked 
about an extension, and they said to come back after '93. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back after '93, and they said they couldn't make that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't say they won't, but I'm not very optimistic. The thing is, I'd 
like to play another two or three years, and I'd like to do it with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not, I'll have to move on and finish up somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade in the majors has toughened Pendleton mentally and taught him that 
pressure is self-created. 
</P>
<P>
 His situation is a motivation, he said, but he can't allow himself to try 
doing more than he can do. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't get caught up worrying that Chipper Jones, sidelined for the season 
by a torn knee ligament but still viewed as Atlanta's prospect of prospects, 
could be headed for third base on a team going with rookie catcher Javier Lopez 
and three rookie left fielders -- Ryan Klesko, Tony Tarasco and Mike Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton said he sometimes thinks about his contributions and uncertain 
future when he's out "sweating my butt off" and is "bugged and disappointed by 
it" but he can't be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to keep rolling," he said. "I mean, my thing is I never look over 
my shoulder. I'm not concerned who's behind me, who's in the minors. I know 
what I can do and I think they know what I can do, and I just have to . . . 
reinforce it." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Bobby Cox doesn't deal with the financial bottom line, but he said: 
"I'd sure like to have Terry back. He's as solid as they come, on and off the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, who turns 34 in July, is guaranteed $10.2 million in his current 
contract and has made another $250,000 in award bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager John Schuerholz suggested that if the economic system is 
changed through collective bargaining, it might affect the Braves' approach to 
Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we've told Terry is that we're not prepared to discuss (a long-term 
commitment) at the moment, and you can underline at the moment ," Schuerholz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying anything about what might happen by the end of the year or in 
the interim, but we're faced with some very difficult business decisions 
because of the system and the salaries, and we're just not prepared to make 
long-term commitments to every one of our players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with the economics of the industry, not whether Terry is 
deserving or not. He's as deserving as any player in the game. He's a guy you'd 
like to have in the organization for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton and the Braves are looking at history in 1994. They can become the 
first National League team to win four consecutive division championships and 
only the second to finish first in four consecutive seasons, the New York 
Giants having won pennants from 1921 through '24. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be pursuing those honors in a new division, the NL East, going head 
to head against the Philadelphia Phillies, who beat them in the '93 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton said he gives credit to the Phillies but believes that the Braves 
were fatigued by their race against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he disliked the wild-card concept -- "That's football, not baseball" 
-- but isn't concerned about which division Atlanta is in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the all-time race last year," he said. "I don't know about winning 104 
games again, but we have the capability to win again. I think we approach it 
with the confidence that it doesn't matter what division we're in or who's in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to confidence, the one thing Pendleton isn't so sure of is where 
he'll be in 1995. ON STRAW 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on Darryl Strawbery the other night, the Padres' Tony Gwynn seemed 
to endorse the view of Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda that drug use is a weakness, 
not a disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'll get mail on this, but there's a conscious decision involved in 
taking drugs," Gwynn said in San Diego. "I know it's supposed to be a disease, 
but it strikes me that it only becomes a disease after a person has taken drugs 
for the first time. Anyone making that decision has to accept responsibility 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn also dismissed the impact of pressure and expectation inherent in a big 
salary and big league position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more a situation where some people are easily influenced," he 
said. TORONTO THUNDER 
</P>
<P>
 Using Carlos Delgado in left field and Alex Gonzalez at shortstop, the Toronto 
Blue Jays had two rookies in their opening-day lineup for only the third time 
in 18 years and first since 1987, when Mike Sharperson and Fred McGriff made 
their debuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado, 22, is one of baseball's highest-rated catching prospects and could 
return to that position in 1995 if Shawn Green, formerly of Tustin High, 
continues to progress as the Blue Jays' top outfield prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Delgado got off to a spectacular start as the left fielder, 
hammering home runs off SkyDome's center-field restaurant in each of the first 
two games against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's been in the league two days and he's hit the two longest home runs 
I've ever seen," White Sox center fielder Lance Johnson said. "We're going to 
have to play him in the third deck and use a bungee cord." 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado had only four at-bats above the double-A level before this season, but 
hit 25 homers and drove in 102 runs at double-A Knoxville last year. He had 30 
homers and 100 RBIs in Class A two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He crushes it to all fields," Blue Jay Vice President Al LaMacchia said of 
the 6-foot-3, 210-pound Puerto Rican who signed as a free agent in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has unbelievable power, like Ryan Klesko (of the Braves), only he's more 
disciplined. He's so disciplined you're not going to see him swing at many bad 
pitches, and he handles adversity well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next to (the Dodgers' Mike) Piazza, he's probably the strongest kid you'd 
want to see swing the bat. If he gets 500 at-bats, there's no reason he won't 
hit 20 to 25 home runs as a rookie." AARON'S ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday's 20th anniversary of his 715th home run, Brave Vice President Henry 
Aaron held a conference call with several reporters and said that despite the 
"personal hell" accompanying his pursuit of Babe Ruth's record -- as well as 
the death threats and racist mail that in some ways still make him a prisoner 
on his Atlanta area estate -- he is now "pretty content" with the recognition 
and rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I was in Babe Ruth's shadow, and I never thought the record 
was anyone's but mine after I hit 715," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some people weren't ready to accept it and still aren't, but as the 
years have gone by, the feeling is more, 'The man hit a lot of home runs and 
deserves our respect.' I can live with that. I'm generally satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves and the city of Atlanta will hold a commemorative banquet for Aaron 
this Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Aaron comments during the conference call: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the prospect of his record being broken: "I don't think the home run 
record or Pete Rose's record for hits will be broken. It's not that there 
aren't players who have the ability, but I question whether the desire and want 
are there, making the money they make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are some outstanding young power hitters in the American League, 
but I haven't seen enough of them. Barry Bonds is the one player who can do 
anything he wants on the field. He's in another category, but whether he'd stay 
around for as long as it takes is something I doubt. Once he gets to the World 
Series, my thinking is he'll feel he's accomplished enough." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On minority hiring: "There's been progress, but there's still a lot that 
needs to be done. An African-American (Blue Jay Manager Cito Gaston) won two 
straight World Series, but there would have been a lot more headlines about him 
if he had lost. Cito deserved more credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are four African-American managers now, but there needs to be more 
hiring in front office decision-making roles, and I still don't feel that the 
African American-players speak up enough about it, recognizing that people like 
Jackie Robinson, Monte Irvin and Don Newcombe paved the way and are owed a debt 
of gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, the players are controlled by their agents. They're making $5 
million and are told by the agents to keep their mouths shut and avoid 
controversy. It's a shame. It's delayed progress."

FORMER BENGAL LEWIS BILLUPS, PASSENGER DIE IN CAR WRECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Cincinnati Bengal defensive back Lewis Billups, mired in legal troubles 
since leaving the NFL, died Saturday when the car he was driving on Interstate 
4 spun out of control, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billups was driving about 100 m.p.h. when the accident occurred.Also killed 
was Danny Green of Kissimmee, a passenger in the Corvette, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billups, 30, died at Orlando Regional Medical Center after being thrown from 
his convertible in the 1 a.m. accident, Lt. Jack Stacey of the Orlando Police 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred after a car driving in front of Billups' Corvette 
changed lanes to exit the interstate in Orlando. The driver of the car, 
20-year-old Marisol Soto of Orlando, stopped to tell police about the crash. 
She will face no charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Billups and Green died after they were thrown from the Corvette, which hit a 
signpost and then a guardrail that impaled the car, Stacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey said it was not known whether alcohol or drugs were involved, but 
autopsies were planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Billups, who lived in Orlando, was drafted by the Bengals in 1985 from North 
Alabama. He played for Cincinnati until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He had faced legal troubles in recent years. He was named in a lawsuit by a 
Seattle woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted by numerous members of the 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 Billups pleaded guilty in March 1993 to making threatening phone calls to pro 
basketball player Rex Chapman in a dispute over Chapman's sister, who had dated 
Billups. Billups was sentenced to a year in prison.

A BITTERSWEET ENDING; DUCKS' CORKUM IS SAD INJURY CUT SHORT HIS SEASON, BUT 
HE'S GLAD TO FINALLY SHOW HE'S A QUALITY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first few days were restful, almost blissful, for Mighty Duck center Bob 
Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the realization finally hit that his finest NHL season had ended 
eight games before it should have, Corkum felt only pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Waves of depression swept over him a few days after he underwent surgery March 
28 to repair a ruptured tendon in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the couch, watching daytime television in his Anaheim Hills home, 
the cold, hard facts became apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not add to his points total of 51 (23 goals, 28 assists), which led 
the team at the time of his injury. He would not help the Ducks advance to the 
Stanley Cup playoffs. He simply would not skate again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum has gone through all manner of emotions since injuring the tendon that 
controls the foot's up-and-down motion in a March 27 collision with 
Philadelphia's Mikael Renberg. 
</P>
<P>
 He still feels sadness that he couldn't finish the season but also elation 
that he established himself -- at long last -- as a quality NHL center. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, happiness is winning out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has been the best year of my life," Corkum said. "It's tough, but 
I'm glad if this had to happen, this was the right time. At least I showed 
management and the guys on the team what I'm capable of. (But) I hoped I could 
play all 84 games." 
</P>
<P>
 When he thinks of all he accomplished, how he underwent a career revival this 
season, he can smile. Temporarily, at least, he can forget about the crutches 
and the cast on his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much for Corkum to be thankful for. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he was stuck in a no-win situation as a fourth-line center for the 
Buffalo Sabres, wondering whether it was time to quit hockey and get a real 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he can look back fondly on the best of his five professional seasons. It 
came to an end in maddening fashion, but what happened before that sure beat 
the alternative Corkum faced in Buffalo, or even Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of last season, John Muckler, Buffalo coach and general manager, 
told Corkum he would either be traded or sent to the Sabres' minor league 
affiliate. There was a logjam at center in Buffalo, and that's the way Muckler 
preferred to handle the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks tossed Corkum a lifepreserver, making him their 14th pick in the 
expansion draft last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards Steven King, Tim Sweeney, Troy Loney, Stu Grimson, Terry Yake and 
Jarrod Skalde were drafted ahead of him, but Corkum wasn't overly concerned 
with proving himself to Duck management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ecstatic," Corkum said. "It was everything I hoped it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 No longer would Corkum be saddled with two brutes for linemates. No longer 
would he sit and grow stiff for as long as 10 minutes between shifts. No longer 
would he face Muckler's wrath for not producing during those infrequent 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks needed his skills desperately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping he could do for us what Joel Otto does for Calgary," said Jack 
Ferreira, Duck general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 What Ferreira sought: a physical, dependable, all-around player who could 
score and yet stop opposing centers with a grinding, suffocating defensive 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Two seasons ago, Ferreira watched Corkum play in the American Hockey League 
playoffs for the Rochester Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really good, really dominated a couple of the series," Ferreira said. 
"I always had him in the back of my mind. Last year, having been with Montreal 
scouting the pros, I thought he fit the mold of the perfect third-line center 
who could go head-to-head with any of the top centers in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabres, loaded with quality centers such as Dale Hawerchuk, Pat LaFontaine 
and Bob Sweeney, didn't offer much chance for Corkum to blossom. He played in 
68 games last season, centering a line with tough guys Gord Donnelly and Rob 
Ray on the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum had six goals and four assists; Donnelly had 11 points and 221 penalty 
minutes; Ray had five points and 211 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Ducks, desperate for goal-scoring and strong defense, Corkum was 
highly valued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had the feeling he could do the job of being a defensive guy," 
Ferreira said. "To put up the numbers -- I think he wants to be a 30-goal 
scorer next season -- that was just something that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 A turning point, according to Ferreira, was an elbow injury that sidelined 
veteran center Anatoli Semenov in mid-December. Somebody had to step into the 
void, and Corkum leaped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys you put into the situation where they're allowed to play, allowed 
to grow and make mistakes (really develop)," Ferreira said. "I don't think 
there was ever a night when he came to the rink and had to worry about his ice 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He established himself. He knew he was going to play a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Quality ice time, so absent in Buffalo, propelled Corkum in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 So many burdens were lifted this season, it's hard to know where to start. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buffalo, he never knew how many shifts he would get, or even if he would 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be sitting on the bench eight to 10 minutes at a time," Corkum said. "I'd 
be all tight and cold. Then Muckler wonders why you haven't produced anything. 
I was thankful to play 68 games last year. I realized how much more ice time I 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were his linemates. Nothing against them personally, you 
understand, but Corkum despised his role as a member of the Sabres' goon line. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did the majority of the fighting," he said of Donnelly and Ray. "We went 
out there playing against other teams' tough line. I always worried, 'Is 
somebody going to run me from behind? Cross-check me across the face?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum had no such concerns this season, playing on one of the Ducks' top 
three lines all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to worry about the cheap stuff," he said. "Just go out and play 
my game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing was that it was fun this year. The whole year was a blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times (last season) I almost gave it up. What the hell do I need 
this for? I have my degree (from Maine). I don't need to be beating my head 
against the wall. This year was fun. Easier to play and a lot more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Rehabilitation will soon consume Corkum's life. He is expected to be in a cast 
until later this month and to resume staking in June. There's every reason to 
believe he'll be fit in time for training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think better days are ahead," Corkum said. "I'm playing with a lot of 
confidence. If we get (Paul) Kariya in there, and he's the passer everyone says 
he is, that should help. I'm definitely not satisfied. I feel I can score more 
and contribute more to the success of the team."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FINLEY ASSUMES THE ROLE OF STAFF ACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chuck Finley realizes his life has just changed. He will be looked upon 
differently now. He has a prominent responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley is being asked to shoulder the burden of the pitching staff until Mark 
Langston returns from the disabled list. Langston is tentatively scheduled to 
undergo elbow surgery on Tuesday and is expected to be out four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley is now the staff ace. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley has won at least 16 games in four of the last five seasons, but no one 
else in the rotation has won more than eight in either of the last two. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Mark Leiter, who was released three weeks ago by the Detroit Tigers, 
and John Dopson, who was unemployed until January. Phil Leftwich was pitching 
in the minor leagues until last July. And Brian Anderson was in college this 
time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just keep doing what I've been doing and hope it works," Finley said. 
"Believe me, nobody's going to replace Mark. You just don't replace a guy like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you even want to try to replace him, you pick somebody up (in a trade) or 
pull somebody out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitters tend to be more intimidated by names of guys they've heard of and 
seen before than a rookie just coming up. A rookie gives a little giddyup to a 
hitter's step." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Jim Edmonds appeared as if he would be riding the bench for another 
game when he suddenly was summoned to pinch-run in the eighth inning for Bo 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing Edmonds knew, the game was in the ninth inning, and Brewer 
reliever Jesse Orosco was intentionally walking Chili Davis to get to him. 
Edmonds stepped to the plate, and with two out and runners on first and second, 
lined a single to center field, scoring Chad Curtis with the game-winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds pumped his fists into the air, clapped his hands, and celebrated his 
first hit of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to prove I can play up here," said Edmonds, who batted .315 last 
season for triple-A Vancouver. "I can play against right-handers, left-handers, 
it doesn't matter. I'm just out there fighting for my chance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Leiter still tries to cope with his emotions over losing his 9-month-old 
son, Ryan, he still would love to make the Detroit Tigers look a bit foolish 
for releasing him three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show the Angels that they got the best bargain of the season," 
Leiter said. "I don't believe in trying to get even, but I know (the Tigers) 
made a mistake." BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CHRIS GWYNN SIGNS TO PROVIDE PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outfielder Chris Gywnn, released recently by the Kansas City Royals, worked 
out for the Dodgers on Saturday and later was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gywnn, 29, younger brother of the San Diego Padres' Tony Gwynn, was the club's 
first-round pick in the 1985 draft. He played for the Dodgers from 1987 through 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, said Gwynn would provide 
more left-handed punch. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for Gwynn on the roster, the Dodgers optioned reserve shortstop 
Rafael Bournigal to triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he made the move in part so that young players such as Bournigal 
could get more playing time in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want those guys sitting on the bench at Dodger Stadium," Claire said. 
"It doesn't do them any good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day after throwing his no-hitter, pitcher Kent Mercker sat in the Braves' 
dugout and listened to a replay of the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-hander tried to put his memorable moment in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the complete game and the shutout part of it, honestly," Mercker 
said. "My 1-0 record, the team's 5-0 record. The no-hitter is a bonus. It 
hasn't really sunk in. Maybe it never will." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that it was his first start of the season, Mercker wasn't sure he would 
be allowed to finish what he started. Primarily a relief pitcher in his career, 
the 26-year-old had twice before been removed from games in which he had 
allowed no hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker said he could have been expected to throw no more than 90 pitches in 
his first outing. In completing the no-hitter, he tossed 131. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to work up to 131 pitches," Mercker said. "I thank (Manager) 
Bobby (Cox) for that. He kept asking me after each inning how I felt and I said 
'Honestly, I feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker said he would not have blamed Cox for removing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might sound crazy," Mercker said. "But I could have lived with that. 
Throwing no-hitters is not part of my duty. My duty is to keep us in the 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker doesn't have to worry about rushing back to the mound. Because of days 
off on the schedule, he figures to have at least seven days off before his next 
start.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Today's game between the Dodgers and Braves will be broadcast on Korean Radio 
station KBLA (1580). It will be the first of seven scheduled Korean broadcasts 
this season. . . . Honored before the game were college basketball stars Jason 
Kidd of California and Donyell Marshall of Connecticut. Both were finalists for 
the John R. Wooden Award, awarded Friday to Purdue's Glenn Robinson. CHRIS

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MINORS; JORDAN DOESN'T GET THE CALLS AT 
PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a superstar in the NBA, Michael Jordan got all the calls. As a rookie in 
the Southern League, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan struck out three more times, prompting his first argument, and went 
0-for-4 Saturday night for the Double-A Birmingham Barons in a 5-3 loss to 
Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, twice called out on close pitches, is hitless in seven at-bats as a 
baseball pro with five strikeouts. He started slowly in spring training for the 
Chicago White Sox, too, going 0-for-14 before getting three hits in his next 
six tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be concerned about how umps are going to call me. I can't blame 
anyone but myself," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan was called out by plate umpire Ray DiMuro on a 2-2 pitch at the knees 
in the fourth inning. Jordan spun around in the batter's box, yapped at DiMuro, 
tossed his bat toward the dugout on the first-base side and said a few more 
words to the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 As the teams changed sides, Barons manager Terry Francona met DiMuro for a 
brief discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That can't be my concern," Jordan said. "I shouldn't be chasing from day 
one."

MIKE PENNER: THIS TIME AROUND, SON HELPS DAD GET A VICTORY

 Bad news in baseball is an ace pitcher with a sore arm, a press release with 
the words "inflamed left elbow" and "possible multiple loose bodies" in the 
same sentence, a manager lowering his voice and somberly informing the media 
that his team will have to press on without Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad news in baseball is a foul tip when compared to what happens in the 
outside world, when a baby boy is stricken with a terminal muscular disease, 
dies before his first birthday and leaves behind heartbroken parents who cry 
out in the night for answers because they refuse to accept "It's God's plan" or 
"Life isn't fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter pitched six innings Saturday afternoon and watched three more on 
the clubhouse TV without knowing that Mark Langston, now his Angel teammate, 
had been placed on the disabled list, probably headed for surgery. "I'm 
thinking, 'This is a big win, we're back over .500 playing on the road and 
we've got Langston going tomorrow,' " Leiter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the trainer says, 'No, he isn't, he's on the DL.' I didn't even know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where have I been?" 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of us can only imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after attending a memorial service for his 9-month-old son Ryan, who 
died of a child's form of "Lou Gehrig's disease," Leiter pitched for the Angels 
against the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 How he was able to do this, even his teammates couldn't fathom. From a 
distance, they watched, slack-jawed, as Leiter went about his pregame routine 
as if it were just another day -- loosening up, then jogging out to the mound, 
then battling the Brewer hitters to a near-standoff for six nerve-frazzling 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter kept the Angels close enough to win -- which they did with a 
late-inning rally, 6-4 -- despite carrying a load heavier than a hundred 
disabled lists. 
</P>
<P>
 And later he apologizes for being out of touch with the up-to-the-minute news. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mental capacity must be stronger than most of ours," said Chuck Finley, 
also an Angel pitcher, also a father with a young child. "I can't even begin to 
imagine what that's like, watching something like that happen right in front of 
your eyes. And then be able to concentrate well enough to start and pitch a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess when you go through something like that, it makes all of this seem 
like a back-yard game of marbles." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching this game was a form of therapy, Leiter claimed. "I'm lucky," he 
said. "Much luckier than my wife. I have times like today where, for a few 
innings, I do have something to occupy my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But to pitch this game without a moment's thought of Ryan was "impossible," 
Leiter said. As he warmed up in the bullpen, Leiter was ambushed by a sudden 
rush of second thoughts and second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling guilty in the bullpen," Leiter said. "I thinking, 'What am I 
doing? Is it too soon? Is it right?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Here Leiter was, getting ready to play a child's game, a game Ryan never had 
the opportunity to play, and he's getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars 
to do it. Leiter has another son, Mark Jr., who is 3, and was in the stands 
Saturday because he loves baseball and loves watching Dad play catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, Leiter wanted to know, could Mark Jr. be there but not Ryan? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I be so fortunate?" Leiter scolded himself. "Why do so many have 
it so good in life while others have it so difficult?" 
</P>
<P>
 The fog didn't lift until Leiter abruptly turned and fired the baseball he was 
holding against a wall in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mad at myself for the way I was feeling," he said. "I had to realize I 
had work to do, that I had to focus on baseball. But you can't control what 
enters your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 So Leiter gave baseball his partially divided attention for a couple of hours, 
which, quite frankly, is more than baseball had given him in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter was here, clad in an Angel uniform, only because the Detroit Tigers 
released him three weeks ago. Repeat: The Detroit Tigers, with full knowledge 
of Ryan's condition and the day-to-day crisis confronting the Leiter family, 
fired the breadwinner of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they wanted to see some new faces," Leiter said, each word 
dropping like an anvil. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business, baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 America's Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was pitching rotten, throwing only 82 or 83 (miles per hour), I'd have 
said, 'Well, I deserve to get released,' " Leiter said. "But I was throwing 90, 
91. Throwing hard, throwing good. I'm healthy. Why are they getting rid of me? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit I do wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone would have to wonder. Had the recent media attention given Ryan Leiter 
become a "distraction" to the Tigers in their all-consuming quest of the 
American League wild card? Winning is everything, don't you know? And besides, 
it wasn't as if the Tigers were waiving Mickey Lolich or anything. Leiter was 
6-6 last year. To the Tigers, he was just a replaceable part. 
</P>
<P>
 No great altruistic spirit moved the Angels to pick up Leiter. The Angels had 
a hole in their rotation, pure and simple, and figured Leiter might be able to 
fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, since his arrival, Leiter says, "the Angels have been so kind to us, my 
wife and I have been almost uncomfortable with it. Anything we've needed, 
they've been there for us. It's such a good feeling. We've never been killed 
with kindness like that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Leiter attempted to pay back the debt. Beyond that, he was just 
trying to get through the day. For Leiter, there would be no Win One For Ryan 
melodrama, no cheap made-for-TV moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be a freak about it," Leiter said. "I'm not going to put his 
name on my jersey or wear a black band . . . I wasn't going to dedicate the 
game to Ryan. Ryan is the son I lost. There isn't a win or a no-hitter or a 
perfect game or a World Series championship that can make up for that. Nothing 
can replace my son." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Leiter said, Ryan helped win one for Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan battled every day of his 9 1/2 months on this planet," Leiter said. "I'm 
strong and I'm healthy. He fought for every breath. He never quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can handle that, I ought to be able to deal with a baseball game." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Leiter suspects, the Angels will be able to cope with Mark Langston 
on the 15-day disabled list.

DUCKS HOPE TO MAKE KARIYA FEEL AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Kariya is coming to The Pond of Anaheim on Wednesday -- but he's not 
planning to sign anything except autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks -- who treated Kariya and his family to Saturday's game 
against the Canucks -- say they don't expect to reach a contract agreement with 
Kariya until after the June entry draft. No further talks are scheduled until 
the World Championships end next month. But despite a stalemate that leaves 
them millions apart on a multiyear deal, they're having their No. 4 overall 
draft pick down for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want him to see our set-up, maybe go to Disneyland for the day," said 
Coach Ron Wilson, who will fly from Vancouver with Kariya after attending the 
funeral for Canuck owner Frank Griffiths on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya spent an hour or so with Wilson before Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are his future teammates," Wilson said. "I want him to be confident and 
know everyone for next year. It's up to (General Manager) Jack Ferreira, 
(President) Tony Tavares and his agent to sit down and make a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, whose family lives in North Vancouver, saw his first Duck game in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help but think about the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Don Baizley says European teams are interested in Kariya, but the focus 
apparently remains on getting a deal in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I'm with Anaheim next year," Kariya said. "Obviously, I hoped I 
was going to join Anaheim as soon as the Olympics were over. That was a special 
experience. I was coming off a high and I wanted to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The negotiations) have been kind of interesting, me being a business major. 
I've been an integral part of the negotiations from the very beginning. . . . 
(But) I didn't go in with the naive feeling things would just happen the way I 
wanted them to." ROBYN NORWOOD

SANTA ANITA; LUKAS HOPES FOR NEW ENDING TO FAMILIAR-LOOKING SCENARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second consecutive year, Wayne Lukas had to settle for second in the 
Santa Anita Derby on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trainer hopes this isn't a precursor for the Kentucky Derby. After being 
beaten by Personal Hope in Arcadia last year, Union City finished 15th at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Tabasco Cat finish second, he lost by the same margin as Union 
City did here -- three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race that went according to form, Brocco and Tabasco Cat hooked up 
entering the stretch after overtaking Fly'n J. Bryan, then raced as a team 
before Brocco took over in the final yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tabasco Cat's first loss of 1994, and the 3-year-old Storm Cat colt is 
winless in two tries against Brocco. But he was more competitive than during 
their initial meeting. In the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last Nov. 6, Tabasco Cat 
was beaten 6 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, whose last Santa Anita Derby victory came the same year -- 1988 -- that 
he won his lone Kentucky Derby with Winning Colors, was happy with his colt's 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got beat by a good horse," Lukas said. "I'd like to try him again the 
first Saturday in May, but I'm pleased with our horse's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he ran very well off the long layoff (Tabasco Cat's last race was 
March 6)." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Strodes Creek, who finished third, and Numerous, who was fourth, had 
been away longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't change a thing we did," he said. "I feel good about it. Pat (Day) 
said he ran a super race. If we can carry this another 30 days, I'll be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Day, who has ridden Tabasco Cat in three of his five victories, didn't think 
he lost a thing in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with his effort," Day said. "He was just second best on this 
particular afternoon. It had been (34 days) since he'd run and it's the hardest 
race he's had this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he needed this one, and he'll come back for the next one and be 
tighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a horse runs as hard as he did and tries as hard as he did, you can't 
fault him. When (Brocco) came to him, he dug in and tried real hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham wouldn't mind if Strodes Creek followed the same pattern 
Ferdinand did in 1986. He finished third behind Snow Chief and Icy Groom in the 
Santa Anita Derby, then went to Churchill Downs and won at nearly 18-1, giving 
Whittingham his first Kentucky Derby and jockey Bill Shoemaker his fourth and 
last. Whittingham's other starter Saturday, Numerous, finished fourth, five 
lengths behind Strodes Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Making only his fourth lifetime start, Strodes Creek was beaten by 1 3/4 
lengths Saturday in his initial try with blinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get after him kind of early again, but I thought he was the winner 
on the turn," Corey Black said. "He kind of lost his momentum when we 
straightened for home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still very inexperienced. The only difference I saw with the blinkers 
was that his early speed was better without having (to) ride him. Overall, I 
was happy with his race. I think he earned himself a trip (to the Kentucky 
Derby) today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mamselle Bebette, a 4-year-old Copelan filly owned by John Forsythe's Big 
Train Farm, is now the only four-time stakes winner of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 She defeated Cool Air and three others in the $87,225 Las Cienegas Breeders' 
Cup Handicap. Her other victories came in the La Brea, Monrovia and Las Flores 
Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chris McCarron taking over for the injured Corey Nakatani, the 5-2 second 
choice sprinted to the lead at the beginning, saw favored Cool Air get within a 
head a furlong from the finish, then asserted her superiority in the final 
yards. She completed the almost 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf in 1:13. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing for the first time in four California races, Cool Air, the 13-10 
choice, finished two lengths ahead of Bel's Starlet, who bumped the rail for no 
apparent reason in midstretch. Best Dress finished fourth and Miss L Attack was 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third stakes of the day, the $106,000 Santa Paula Stakes, Sardula 
overcame a stumble at the start and rolled to an 8 1/2-length victory in her 
3-year-old debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Away since capturing the Hollywood Starlet on Dec. 18, the Storm Cat filly 
recovered quickly after stumbling to take the lead, fought off a challenge from 
3-1 second choice Serena's World, then drew away to win in 1:15 for the 6 1/2 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's such a superior animal that she recovered quickly (from the stumble) 
and got the job done," trainer Brian Mayberry said. "We've been planning on the 
Kentucky Oaks (May 6) all along, and if everything's all right, that's where 
we'll go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catching another field lacking speed, Possibly Perfect is the 8-5 favorite for 
the $212,800 Santa Barbara Handicap today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Able to get away with extremely slow fractions while winning the Yellow Ribbon 
as a 16-1 longshot last November and as the 2-1 second choice in the Santa Ana 
on March 19, the 4-year-old Northern Baby filly should be cruising on the lead 
again today. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Bobby Frankel and owned by Blue Vista Inc., Possibly Perfect has 
won five of eight starts since coming to the United States early last year. A 
victory in the 1 1/4-mile Santa Barbara would be her third Grade I. Kent 
Desormeaux will again ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero's Love, who closed well to finish second in the Santa Ana, is the 2-1 
second choice.

NEW PRESIDENT VOWS TO REVIVE PIERCE COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since its birth in 1947, Pierce College has enjoyed a reputation as a special 
institution. For years, the campus drew larger enrollments, sent more students 
on to universities and had wealthier neighbors than any of its sister campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the community college still stands out, but now it's mostly for the 
problems it faces: 
</P>
<P>
 * Capping a two-year free-fall, campus enrollment this spring plummeted to its 
lowest level since 1969, dropping it to fourth in student population among the 
nine colleges in the vast Los Angeles Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 * A collapsed real estate deal has left Pierce facing an estimated 
$1.5-million budget deficit for the year, the largest in the district. Absent 
some relief, Pierce will face the further drain of having to repay the debt to 
the district over three years starting in mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lingering problems with a lack of institutional direction, poor morale on 
faculty and staff, and dilapidated facilities -- made worse from more than $2 
million in damage in the Northridge earthquake -- continue to plague the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this caldron Monday steps Mary Lee as Pierce's interim president for at 
least a two-year stint. After 13 years as president of Valley College in Van 
Nuys, she arrives at Pierce with a self-described mission to "stop the downward 
trend and start bringing it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a 55-year-old Chatsworth resident who was an administrator and part-time 
student at Pierce in the late 1970s, will become the institution's sixth 
president since then. Lowell Erickson, Pierce's president since mid-1991 who 
sought a leave, said he will move to the district's Downtown Los Angeles 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before her official start, Lee last week was already talking changes. 
Some proposals include transferring underused occupational programs at Pierce 
to other campuses by this fall as part of a curriculum shake-up, and new 
efforts to regain lost enrollment and revitalize Pierce's trademark farm. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Woodland Hills campus, faculty and staff members voiced hope that Lee 
can bring some direction to a school that many say has been adrift for years. 
But that hope was tempered with skepticism that she can overcome tight funding 
for education in general and the district's own bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said she's ready for the challenge. "I believe the people at Pierce 
College are looking for direction," she said. "And I believe they are looking 
for someone who can make the tough decisions that they know need to be made -- 
but don't want to make -- in order for the institution to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district as a whole has been hobbled by declining enrollments, 
aging facilities and other conflicts, Pierce's problems appear more severe than 
those at either of its San Fernando Valley sister campuses. Valley College is 
considered the district's most efficiently run campus. Mission College in 
Sylmar is the newest and fastest-growing site. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Neil Yoneji, the chancellor of the 882-square-mile district 
who is serving on an interim basis, declined to say whether he considered 
Pierce to be in the worst shape of his nine campuses. But he said the problem 
there is "a large one." 
</P>
<P>
 The urgency of putting Pierce right was one of the main reasons Yoneji said he 
decided to move Lee to Pierce last month instead of allowing the campus to have 
its own search committee, as is the custom. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern was to stabilize the institution as soon as possible," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with its problems, Pierce College remains a big part of the district. The 
college still has the largest operating budget, about $21.8 million; its 
campus, at more than 400 acres, is nearly four times the size the next largest, 
and it has the highest number of permanent faculty, about 209. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other characteristics, the campus's West Valley service area has higher 
family incomes than any other district college. Its student body, about 60% 
white, has the fewest minorities. And the campus has long sent the most 
students on to four-year institutions, about 1,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 So where, officials are asking, have all Pierce's students gone? From fall 
1983 to fall 1993, the enrollment decline of 26.2% was by far the largest in 
the district. The student population during that time dropped from 21,260 to 
15,695, its lowest level since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 After dipping below 20,000 in 1984, Pierce's year-to-year enrollments actually 
remained around 18,000 for the remainder of the decade. The college had the 
district's largest enrollment from 1976 to 1988, dipped below Valley in 1989, 
and then regained the lead in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the bottom began falling out. A modest 3.2% decline to 18,584 
students in fall 1992 was followed by a huge 15.5% decline to 15,695 students 
by fall 1993, the college's largest loss on record. Campus officials blamed a 
that year's statewide fee hike for students already holding bachelor's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the earthquake hit this January and the campus lost another 6.6% of its 
students, to begin this spring semester with only 14,663. The net two-year 
enrollment loss is nearly 4,000 students, or 21%, leaving Pierce behind Valley, 
Los Angeles City and East Los Angeles colleges in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee believes the college has not worked as hard at recruiting students and 
updating its class offerings as have other campuses. Others said the campus, 
like others in the large district, is losing students to other nearby community 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is promising a bolstered recruiting campaign this fall. She also is 
promising a new course work package for certain majors that would guarantee 
students can complete their transfer requirements in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining enrollments at California community colleges today is more a 
matter of survival than pride. State funding for colleges is pegged to their 
enrollment. So fewer students this year tends to mean less money next year, 
which then results in even fewer courses and students. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the hope of avoiding that downward spiral that led Pierce officials 
into their current deficit. Faced with a $21.8-million budget this year, 11% 
below spending in the previous year, Pierce officials limited their course 
reductions this fall and took a $1-million gamble, which they lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a deal approved by the district's Board of Trustees last August, Pierce 
was to get about $1 million from the developers of the controversial Warner 
Ridge project nearby in exchange for permission to dump 425,000 cubic yards of 
soil on vacant Pierce property. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson arranged Pierce's fall course offerings on the promise the college 
would get the money, only to have the deal collapse when the Warner Ridge 
project unraveled in January. Now the college is out the $1 million, as well as 
several hundred thousand dollars in related costs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath, Lee said the college's academic offerings must become 
self-supporting. "Outside funding is not going to rescue curriculum review and 
the revitalization of the instructional program," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said she is looking at cost-cutting moves that include canceling or 
restructuring an as-yet unspecified number of vocational classes at Pierce. The 
college's industrial technology department, one of several overstaffed for its 
enrollment, is considered one likely target. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of cutbacks, instructors of affected classes would be transferred 
to other district campuses. Since many of Pierce's faculty members are longtime 
veterans, however, one district official said the move might also spur 
retirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee also has talked of possible cuts in the college's athletic programs. And 
district officials are talking about consolidating various support services 
among the district's three Valley campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the question of what will become of Pierce's farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has deteriorated in facilities and activities over the years, the 
farm and horticulture area account for about 240 of Pierce's more than 400 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 To local residents, the property is a bastion of open space and Valley 
history. To others, it's a money-making prospect that lies fallow. Although 
district officials said there are no plans at present to sell off the property, 
it has been proposed for various commercial ventures in the past, including a 
golf course and an equestrian center. Lee, who took agriculture classes at 
Pierce when she worked there and at Valley between 1977 and 1981, has proposed 
trying to upgrade the farm with both historic and high-tech elements. By 
offering tours for schoolchildren and holding community activities there, she 
said the farm could serve as a campus recruiting attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Mick Sears, chairman of Pierce's agriculture and natural resources department, 
said he has been encouraged by Lee's statements favoring efforts to revitalize 
the farm. But he's less optimistic that his courses will survive cost-cutting 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce began in 1947 as the Clarence W. Pierce College of Agriculture, named 
after the board member who spearheaded its founding. The college's original 
mission was to train war veterans for agriculture careers, but weak demand even 
then soon led to a broader curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is optimistic about the farm's future despite the tough economic times. 
She hopes to persuade off-campus groups to pay for improvements. But Sears said 
district bureaucracy and ambivalence has long stymied upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Pierce remains a college with a chip on its shoulder, and some 
say deservedly so. Faculty members who teach in leaky classrooms, use 
antiquated equipment or swelter in the summer because much of the campus lacks 
air conditioning say the district has bled Pierce dry over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an element of truth to that," concedes Yoneji. For years, the 
district's larger colleges such as Pierce earned money that was shifted to the 
smaller campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district's been siphoning off resources, and now they're very angry at 
Pierce because we're not the cow that's producing all that milk anymore," 
complained Sid Elman, a political science professor and head of the faculty 
union chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, larger colleges such as Valley and Pierce have been getting 
general operating funds ranging between $2,100 and $2,300 per full-time 
student. Smaller colleges such as Southwest, West Los Angeles and Harbor have 
received $2,400 to more than $3,000, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the mix the series of presidents who have cycled through Pierce, most 
installed by the district rather than picked by the campus. And the result, as 
chemistry professor Barrie Logan said, has been "an increasing sense of drift 
and a lack of anyone doing anything to try to reverse this." 
</P>
<P>
 During her tenure, Lee countered, she will not accept a lack of money or 
district cooperation as excuses for failed initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 And to her new campus, she said: "I believe a college president can make a big 
difference." Community College Enrollment

VALLEY BRIEFING: ZONE OF HOPE; SECTION OF PACOIMA PUSHING FOR EMPOWERMENT ZONE

 To relieve poverty in the area, local officials in Pacoima are pushing for a 
central section of that community and a southern part of Lake View Terrace to 
be included in the city's federal empowerment zone application. That 
designation would allow the residents and businesses in the 1.9-square mile 
area to share $100 million in social service grants and give businesses located 
inside the zone tax incentives for hiring people who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed area included two large public housing complexes, two schools and 
commercial strips along sections of Van Nuys, Glenoaks and Foothill boulevards. 
Most of the rest is made up of modest single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the City Council and mayor will decide if Pacoima will be among the 
areas included in the city's empowerment zone application. Later this summer, 
the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development will select six urban areas 
around the country for empowerment zone status. Remapping a Local Economy 
</P>
<P>
 While commercial areas along Van Nuys and Glenoaks boulevards will probably be 
reserved for small shops and businesses, sections along Foothill Boulevard 
could be the focus of light industries and warehouses. City Councilman Richard 
Alarcon envisions a concessions business for the park. Comparing Ethnic Makeups

 Fire is part of the natural life that is destructive, yet also restorative. 
Portions of Crystal Cove State Park and Laguna Coast Wilderness blackened in 
the fall's fires have sprung to life with pink, yellow, blue and purple 
flossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 These "fire followers," as they are called, appear only after fires and have 
joined the vibrant display of wildflowers blooming this spring in Orange 
County's varied landscape which changes from desert-like conditions to lush oak 
woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeds of some plants actually need the heat of fire to germinate and can 
remain dormant for decades before sprouting. Scientists are also discovering 
that a chemical in charred wood or smoke also seems to trigger germination. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires also clear away competing plants, allowing these specialized wildflowers 
to grow. Fire followers are the showiest flowers to appear after a fire, and 
will predominate the next few seasons until they become crowded out by other 
vegetation. Catalina Mariposa Lily 
</P>
<P>
 Calochortus catalinae * When it blooms: March-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Grassy slopes in heavy soil, Grassland and Coastal Sage 
habitats at low elevations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Mariposa means "butterfly" in Spanish and single 2-to-3-inch 
flowers sit on delicate 1-to-2-foot stems. Yellow Mariposa Lily is another 
dominant fire-follower, found from April to June on dry slopes in Chaparral. 
Foothill Lupine 
</P>
<P>
 Lupinus succulentus  
</P>
<P>
 * When it blooms: February-April. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Heavy clay soil on grassy slopes, grasslands and coastal 
sage scrub plant communities below 1,500-foot elevations. Currently blooming at 
Carbon Canyon Regional Park, along with bush and dove Lupine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Stout, erect branching stem 8 to 24 inches high. This lupine is 
thicker and fleshier than other lupines. Other lupines that follow fire are 
Dove and Coulter's lupine. Parry's Phacelia 
</P>
<P>
 Phacelia parryi * When it blooms: March-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Chaparral and Coastal Sage along Orange County coastline. 
Large-flowered and Parry's Phacelia currently blooming on inland side of 
Crystal Cove State Park and Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Reaches 2 feet high with sticky, single or sparsely branched 
stems. Other related fire followers are large-flowered phacelia and California 
bells. Large-flowered Phacelia is an abundant fire-follower which is lighter 
purple and blooms Feb.-June. Fire Poppy 
</P>
<P>
 Papaver californicum * When it blooms: April-May first season after fire. 
Rarely found non-fire years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Oak woodland and chaparral along canyons. Currently 
blooming at Crystal Cove Park and Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. While 
California poppies are not having a strong year, they can be found at most 
regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Slender stems reach 1 to 2 feet high. The four petals are not 
as satiny as related California Poppy. Other related fire-followers are the 
wind poppy, which is darker orange-red and the bush poppy, a short-lived shrub 
with yellow flowers that germinates only after fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where To Go Nature lovers can see fire followers in burn areas of Crystal 
Cove State Park and Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. Ronald W. Caspers Regional 
Park reports that most Orange County wildflowers can be found on its acreage. 
Look for lupines, poppies and dozens of other species at the following 
locations. Who to Call In Orange County, the Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park 
publishes a monthly calendar of wildflowers in bloom. To receive the 
newsletter, call (714) 831-2175. For a listing of wildflowers blooming in 
Santiago Oaks Regional Park, (714) 538-4429. For wildflower updates across 
Southern California with limited Orange County listings, Theodore Payne 
Foundation has a wildflower hot line: (818) 768-3533. Cycle of Life The showy 
rebirth of wildflowers after fire is just one link in a cycle that has been 
occurring for thousands of years in our mountains. 1. Fires burn hillsides in 
winter, clearing brush and leaving layer of ash. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Rains fall the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Ash acts as fertilizer for wildflowers, which are first plants to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Following year larger plants continue to grow. Wildflowers come back for 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Next year woodier plants take over, smothering wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Fires burn hillsides and cycle starts again.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; STOP MAKING OUR CHILDREN PAY TWICE FOR DISASTER AID; THE 
VALLEY INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE ASSN. THINKS IT IS TIME FOR US TO TAKE ON AN 
ADMITTEDLY BIG FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND STOP STICKING IT TO OUR KIDS.

<P>
 For the next 30 years it will cost America's children and grandchildren $377 
million a year in interest alone to pay back the money the federal government 
had to borrow for relief after the Northridge earthquake. By the time the 
30-year bonds the government sells to cover the deficit mature, the total cost 
of the $7.2 billion in aid will have tripled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, Congress has borrowed more than $72 billion to finance 
disaster aid and is paying interest of $1.5 billion a year. That is enough to 
put 15,000 police officers on U.S. streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't it make sense to stop burdening our children and grandchildren with 
expenses that should be ours? Doesn't it make sense to plan and budget for 
these expenses? It is time for us to take responsibility for our disasters, pay 
as we go and stop sticking it to our kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. thinks it is. And the association, 
representing 350 businesses and affiliates that employ more than 150,000 people 
in and around the San Fernando Valley, is urging Southern California 
legislators to lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
 VICA has proposed that an insurance trust fund be created and that it be 
funded by charging a 1% surtax on personal and corporate income taxes. The 
money could be spent only for natural disasters, acts of God. An area would 
have to be declared a disaster by the President, and Congress would have to 
approve any expenditures. If for some reason the fund did not have enough money 
to cover the cost of applicable federal aid, Congress would be authorized to 
borrow money to lend to the trust for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would not change the law governing what kind of assistance would 
be granted, so expenditures would not go up. It would simply create a new 
funding source. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1% surtax -- an additional payment of 1% of the tax for that year -- would 
cost the average taxpayer $72 a year. The Northridge earthquake would be paid 
for in one year instead of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this would be a new tax. But the net effect would be to reduce taxes, 
because paying as we go is much less costly than "charging it." 
</P>
<P>
 A skeptic might ask, "Why not just use the money from a surtax to lower the 
deficit?" It is true that the net effect would be the same, but the American 
public is understandably mistrustful about Congress' willingness to use 
additional taxes to lower the deficit. A dedicated insurance trust fund would 
be off-limits to a Congress desperately seeking funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe there is nothing wrong with financing disasters over a 
long period, since much of the money is used for rebuilding infrastructure such 
as roads and buildings. While this argument has merit, paying three or four 
times the actual cost does not. Why should our children have to pay twice? 
</P>
<P>
 A bipartisan effort among local lawmakers would be a welcome change. Southern 
Californians would be trendsetters, departing from our preoccupation with 
immediate gratification out of concern for future generations.

VAN BUREN CHANGES HIS STORY ON SHOOTING; JURISPRUDENCE: ONE DAY AFTER BEING 
ARRESTED, HE SAYS HE LIED TO COVER FOR A COMPANION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after his arrest for allegedly shooting a gun into his girlfriend's 
home, all-state football player Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park High said 
Saturday night he told authorities that he fired the gun to cover for a 
companion who actually pulled the trigger. Van Buren's girlfriend corroborated 
that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been lying about the whole situation," Van Buren said from his Newbury 
Park home. "It wasn't me who fired the gun. I was there, but I didn't shoot the 
gun. I just don't want (my girlfriend) Marcie (James) getting in trouble, so 
I'm going to go ahead and take the blame for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, 18, was arrested Friday on suspicion of firing a single shot 
through the back door of James' home in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police press release, Van Buren and James, 19, argued twice 
Friday morning over the telephone. He then went to James' home and demanded to 
be let in, but James refused. Then, police said, Van Buren pulled out a handgun 
and fired a shot through the back door. The bullet lodged in a wall in the 
home. No one was injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Buren and James contradicted that story, though James refused specific 
comment. Both maintained that another male -- whom they would not name -- 
accompanied Van Buren to James' house, and that this man had the gun and was 
the one who actually fired it. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren would not say specifically why the man shot into the door, only that 
"it was to prove a point to (James' mother, Catherine)." 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Buren said he did not tell his version of the incident to Ventura 
County Sheriff's detectives when they came to Van Buren's residence and 
arrested him on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and shooting at an 
inhabited dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I tell on that person, something can happen to me and Marcie and our 
daughter (Andreya, 23 months old) and Marcie knows it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviewing Van Buren and taking statements from witnesses, police 
booked him only on the second charge. He was released later that day on $5,000 
bail, posted by his guardian, Ken McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The police) came to my house my house looking for the gun, and they didn't 
find it," Van Buren said. "They just came and arrested me without even asking 
me any questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither officer involved in the arrest could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren said the disturbance was caused mainly by tensions over James' 
parents' disapproval of his relationship with James, and their apparent 
unwillingness to let her go with him to the University of Colorado, where he 
has earned a football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the senior's future at the Boulder school is uncertain. Van Buren said 
that he already spoke to Colorado recruiting coordinator Chuck Heater. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said they were going to help me as best they could," Van Buren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado sports information director Dave Plati said Saturday that Van Buren's 
football scholarship could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one of our players gets in trouble with the law, there are no doubts 
that the scholarship is at risk," he said. "But it's basically a wait and see 
situation, to see what he's eventually charged and convicted of." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren helped Newbury Park win the Southern Section Division III 
championship last fall. The 6-foot-1, 190-pounder finished his high school 
career as the state's career leader in receptions (269) and yardage (4,456). He 
is ranked second nationally in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren moved to Newbury Park from Los Angeles when he was 13, seeking a

NAJAR TO MISS REST OF CSUN'S SEASON WITH ARM FRACTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge right-hander John Najar suffered a fractured bone in his 
throwing arm while on the mound Friday night and is out for the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar, a junior, is the second member of the Matadors' three-member starting 
rotation whose season ended prematurely.Right-hander Keven Kempton was lost to 
elbow surgery six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar, who was 5-3 with an earned-run average of 5.83, broke the ulna -- the 
larger forearm bone -- while throwing a fastball in the eighth inning of 
Friday's 9-8 loss to San Diego State, which leads the Western Athletic 
Conference West Division with a record of 7-3. Northridge is one game behind 
the Aztecs at 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Najar's teammates said they heard the bone crack from the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned white," pitcher Aaron D'Aoust said. 
</P>
<P>
 After throwing the pitch, Najar cradled his arm and walked into right field. 
He said he had been pitching with a hairline stress fracture that finally broke 
completely. He isn't sure how or when the stress fracture occurred and had been 
throwing in pain for several weeks. "It just gave out," Najar said. "I knew 
there was a chance this could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (18-18 overall) are in the midst of a key three-game Western 
Athletic Conference series at first-place San Diego State. Saturday's game was 
rained out and will be made up as part of a doubleheader at 2 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors play another big WAC series next weekend in Hawaii. "It's pretty 
ill-timed," Coach Bill Kernen said with a sigh. "Now you take everybody you've 
got (left to fill the void)." 
</P>
<P>
 Najar was even more frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disappointing," he said. "Why did this have to happen to me? Why 
right now?"

DIGEST: GRAY BECOMES THIRD RECRUIT TO PICK CSUN FOR BASKETBALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Gray, a 6-foot-6 forward from Canada College in Redwood City, Calif., has 
orally committed to accept a basketball scholarship to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, accurate from long range, is the third recruit to choose 
Northridge.Reseda High guard Trenton Cross and Thousand Oaks High center Paul 
Brandt signed with the Matadors in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray averaged 19.9 points and seven rebounds for Canada, which finished 17-13, 
10-6 in the Coast Conference. In conference play, he made 40 of 99 three-point 
attempts. He scored more than 30 points three times, with a high of 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge coaches privately have compared Gray to Keith Gibbs, the Matadors' 
scoring leader in the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gibbs, Gray chose Northridge over mostly small-college competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play Division I," said Gray, who also was courted by Cal Poly 
Pomona and UC Davis. "Plus, I wanted to go back to Southern California so my 
parents could see me play." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray grew up in Twentynine Palms, where his family still resides. Bowling  
</P>
<P>
 Eric Forkel of Chatsworth lost his only match in Saturday's stepladder finals 
to finish in third place in the $250,000 BPAA U.S. Open bowling tournament in 
Troy, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkel, who qualified second, was defeated by Parker Bohn III, 228-202. 
Basketball  
</P>
<P>
 Jordan O'Gilvie scored 13 points, including all six of his team's points in 
overtime, as Tarzana Bantam defeated Woodland Hills, 42-39, to win the boys' 
10-year-old division Valley regional championship of the Los Angeles Parks and 
Recreation Department. T.J. Stephens led Tarzana with 17 rebounds and 10 
points. MIKE HISERMAN

RIDE TO THE FUTURE; IT'S THE DAWN OF ON-LINE ERA IN O.C.; ARRAY OF INFORMATION 
SERVICES WILL COME PIECEMEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI and ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an age of hypermedia and media hype, the information superhighway promises 
us movies any time we want them, tomorrow's newspaper today and virtual 
amusement parks in our living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a freeway system, the information superhighway will take years to build, 
and on-ramps will be scarce at first. But as early as next month, Orange County 
will begin its journey into the future as new services begin coming on-line 
neighborhood by neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, homes in some parts of the county will get access to hundreds of TV 
channels carrying video games, home shopping services, vintage TV shows and 
movies, plus recent box-office hits, local and national news, sports and 
education shows. Other customers will be able to order pay-per-view programs on 
the spot with their remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is an important market because it has a large population of 
affluent, well-educated people with the interest and the means to buy services 
such as electronic encyclopedias and customized video programming. And they are 
eager to subscribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Sipe, publisher of Computer Gaming World magazine in Anaheim Hills, says 
he may rent a house in Orlando, Fla., later this year just to try out a new 
interactive games system being test-marketed there by Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to get wired," Sipe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the phone company rather than the cable-TV industry has the most 
ambitious superhighway itinerary here. Anticipating that the demand for 
services like video-conferencing, electronic mail, game networks and customized 
news shows will skyrocket, Pacific Bell is spending $16 billion on a statewide 
network of fiber-optic cable -- the conduit for two-way communication, or 
interactive service. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in May, the company will begin laying cable in the historic circle of 
the city of Orange and will spiral outward to reach 75,000 homes within a year. 
The first new service on the lines, which will carry thousands of times more 
electronic impulses than regular phone wires, will be scores of TV channels: 70 
in 1995, as many as 370 by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In another twist, the new technology will come to the oldest areas of Orange 
County first, the company said, because the aging copper phone lines there are 
expensive to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have heard from a number of folks who wish they were in the initial 
development areas," said Steve Harris, a vice president of in charge of 
interactive services for Pacific Bell. "We're building it as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition will surface as cable- and satellite-TV providers, as well as 
"wireless" entities such as cellular-phone companies, TV and microwave radio 
operators, explore what services consumers will be willing to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not promising anything until we know whether some of the services will 
be profitable," said Barbara Lukens, a spokeswoman for Comcast Cablevision, 
which serves Buena Park, Fullerton, Santa Ana and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Other so-called information distributors are also proceeding cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're joking that they're going to build a super toll road," said Linda 
Brill, spokeswoman for Hughes Aircraft Co.'s DirecTv, an El Segundo-based 
satellite system that aims also to compete with cable television. "There is 
demand for quality entertainment but not things like (home) banking or 
pizza-ordering." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Pacific Bell is "not betting the business on the service taking off like 
a rocket ship in the next four years," Harris said. "It's not going to 
revolutionize your life in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 But the information highway is nonetheless inching its way forward. Here is an 
overview of what the information distributors -- from well-established 
corporations like Pacific Bell to start-up companies like DirecTv -- will 
offer. PHONE COMPANIES 
</P>
<P>
 By the year 2000, Pacific Bell aims to extend fiber-optic cable to every home 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the initial rewiring will include the Orange historic 
circle, Chapman and Glassell streets. Next will come parts of Villa Park, 
Anaheim, Garden Grove, Cypress, Buena Park and Stanton. The next phase -- Yorba 
Linda, Santa Ana and Tustin -- will be completed by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens after that will depend largely on consumers. If they request 
videophones, movies on demand, and computer networks that offer information on 
specific topics such as travel or sports, then service providers will offer 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of wiring each house is expected to be less than $1,000, which will 
mean low-priced basic service, Pacific Bell officials say. The extras, however, 
may be another story.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're in for sticker shock" for specialized services, said David 
Lundeen, an executive at Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. The company, based in 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is investing in superhighway services. "Your cable and 
telephone bill could be $200 a month." CABLE TV 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Cable Services, Orange County's biggest cable provider, is spending 
$71.7 million to increase its channel capacity and pave the way for new 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 By this summer, Dimension's 43,000 customers in the Irvine area will have 62 
channels instead of the 40 they now get. By year's end they will have 80 
channels, and by the end of 1995 that will increase to 110. The company, owned 
by Times Mirror Co., said that the monthly fee for its basic service will not 
change but that some of the new channels may cost extra. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's 138,000 customers in South Orange County will have the same 62 
channels and 110 by the end of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension, based in Irvine, is adding programming such as CSPAN2, TV Food 
Network, the Nashville Network, and education and government-access channels. 
Three new pay-per-view channels represent the company's first venture into 
interactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part for us as cable operators to answer," said Dimension 
spokeswoman Susan Ritchie, "is what do we do with all this (technology)? The 
application side hasn't revealed itself yet." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the unknowns, she said, is "how willing the market is to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon Cablesystems, which with 95,000 customers is Orange County's No. 2 
cable company, is also upgrading its equipment. The company said it is spending 
more than $17 million for fiber-optic lines in the cities it serves: Fountain 
Valley, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Midway City, Rossmoor, 
Stanton and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new lines begin operating on May 1, customers will receive a clearer 
picture, said Don Weddle, a Paragon spokesman. Also, the 76% of Paragon's 
Orange County customers who now get only 46 channels will have 75. (The 
remaining 24% receive 104 channels now.) The basic-service fee will not change. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon subscribers in Garden Grove and Los Alamitos can already fashion a 
channel lineup that suits the tastes of the individual household. And later 
this year, the company will phase in "smart" converter boxes that can 
accommodate two-way signals. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new interactive boxes, the customer will be able to order 
pay-per-view movies by pointing a "smart" remote control at the box and pushing 
a "buy" button. Paragon calls the service, which doesn't require a phone call 
to the cable company, "near video-on-demand." 
</P>
<P>
 The service represents not only convenience for the customer but also savings 
for the company, General Manager Janet Spatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rolling a truck out at 9 p.m. so someone can watch a movie and rolling it 
back out again at 11 p.m. to turn it off -- that's not cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Spatz said she will move cautiously, however, into the interactive future: "I 
don't want to throw a bunch of new applications at my customers and have them 
turn around and say, 'I don't want to pay for this.' " WIRELESS CABLE 
</P>
<P>
 This new service is gaining popularity because of its low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside, for example, where wireless cable became available in May, 1992, 
Cross Country Wireless Cable Inc. has signed up 43,000 subscribers who pay 
about $30. Many of those customers were lured from the area's cable-TV 
operators, who charge about $50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable, which uses microwave radio signals to beam TV programming into 
homes that have receiver dishes, has a technological disadvantage. It can offer 
31 channels at most, and the signal can be blocked by hills or tall buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country is counting on the technology, however, to allow it to 
eventually offer four or five times as many channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Peter Frank said that 40 of the channels would be devoted to 
interactive classroom programs by participating colleges in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Several other stations would be devoted to programming in 
Spanish and Asian languages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country has yet to acquire a license to operate in Orange County, 
however, so all plans are still tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable won't give a subscriber access to worldwide services, said 
George Ring, chief executive of Cross Country, but it will provide the most 
popular ones -- such as recent movie hits -- at a low price. SATELLITE TV 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co.'s DirecTv, which will provide 150 channels by satellite, 
will be operating nationwide by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellites do not actually provide interactive capability. But they are 
often mentioned as a serious contender in the coming information age, 
especially by those who are unhappy with the program lineups offered by 
cable-TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jim Peters, a 38-year-old Fullerton resident: "I'm going to buy a 
satellite as soon as it's available." 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTv decoder boxes and satellite dishes will sell for $699 each beginning 
in May in a limited number of markets, and in Orange County by the third 
quarter. Subscriptions will cost $21.95 to $29.95 a month for 70 channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Its interactivity will be limited to what cable TV already offers: 
pay-per-view shows and custom programming. But compared to cable's current 
services and prices, DirecTv could seem like a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Premium networks such as The Disney Channel, which sells for an extra $12.95 a 
month on most cable systems, will be available free on DirecTv. But the service 
will not feature some local options such as news, government and educational 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, analysts say, DirecTv will do best in areas that cable TV doesn't 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ryon, analyst at market researcher Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, said, 
"Satellite and wireless could do well in dense areas like New York City or 
rural areas," where laying cable is impractical. "That's going to be their 
stronghold." 
</P>
<P>
 * JOURNEY ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY Just what is the information 
superhighway and what will it bring to Orange County? It's the road to the 
future of on-line services. As early as 1995, telephone companies and cable-TV 
firms will offer an array of interactive entertainment, educational and 
consumer programming by television and, eventually, a personal computer. In 
most cases, a converter box placed on top of the TV set will be required. Phone 
and cable companies will compete for subscribers, each vying to determine what 
consumers want and how much they are willing to pay. A look at some of the 
services available in the not-so-distant future: * 
</P>
<P>
 Video conferencing: ACE Widget Co. arranges a meeting by television with its 
business associates in Seattle and Bellflower. It cuts down on commuting and 
travel costs. * 
</P>
<P>
 Tele-education: At a middle school in Laguna Beach, Tran wants to explain to 
his eighth-grade class the importance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. He orders 
from a video database King's "I Have a Dream" speech. Meanwhile, in another 
Thurston classroom, students who went through the October fires share advice by 
television with Elmira, N.Y., students, whose school was also damaged by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Video games: Pamela wants to play a video game with her friend, Tiffany, on 
the East Coast. They can play by long-distance television and watch each 
other's moves and reactions on screen. * 
</P>
<P>
 Home shopping: Alex, still on crutches from a recent injury, takes delivery of 
his new refrigerator, ordered through an on-line catalogue that includes video 
demonstrations of several brands. To order, he simply pushed a button on his 
remote control for automatic credit-card payment and arranged for delivery. The 
service allowed him to comparison-shop without leaving home. * 
</P>
<P>
 Community information: The Gallardos want to know what permits are required 
for them to add a second story to their home. They browse electronic community 
bulletin boards and communicate electronically with city officials. They order 
and receive the required forms from the city, fill them out and return them -- 
all by cable. * 
</P>
<P>
 Video database: David wants to prepare Thai food for a dinner party. He scans 
his on-screen menu for cooking shows featuring Thai recipes. He selects a 
previously aired program and follows along in the kitchen. * 
</P>
<P>
 Time-shifted TV: Blanca works the night shift and misses David Letterman's 
show. At 10 a.m., she can watch the Late Show without having to tape the 
program. * 
</P>
<P>
 Movies on demand: George wants to rent an Academy Award-winning film he missed 
at the theater. Without getting in his car, he can select a movie on his TV 
screen menu. He can also see previews before making his selection.

MERGING INTO ELECTRONIC TRAFFIC ON SUPERHIGHWAY IS CAUSING SOME ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Say the words information superhighway , and everyone nods sagely. We're hip. 
</P>
<P>
 But listen closely, and you'll notice a bit of tension when the talk turns to 
specifics. The concept is so huge and abstract that many minds have trouble 
grasping it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, especially in business settings, we feel obliged to speak of 
cyberspace with some intelligence. It is, after all, the future. 
</P>
<P>
 That is producing some anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Johnson, president of Irvine ad agency Johnson/Ukropina, concedes that 
the idea of traveling this particular road makes her nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me know when the information superhighway is coming," she said, "so I can 
get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson acknowledges that she still hasn't figured out how to program her VCR. 
But even the technologically gifted are having doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wired magazine, written for travelers in cyberspace, told readers in its March 
issue that the information superhighway is bunk. "There will be no 500-channel 
future. . . . There will be no virtual sex." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospect of increased reliance on electronic communication is making 
some people jittery. 
</P>
<P>
 A man at a recent breakfast meeting of communications professionals said he 
has heard that home buyers soon will be able to call up housing prices on their 
home computers and place their own bids, thus eliminating the need for real 
estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought a quick rebuttal from Jay Tolman, director of advertising for 
Century 21, who happened to be at the same table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salespeople have to provide added value," Tolman insisted. Besides, he said, 
people can already become their own real estate agents if they want to -- but 
is that a good thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Others question whether the superhighway even exists. John Vrba, head of 
Western International Media's Newport Beach office, declares that home shopping 
services, Sonic-the-Hedgehog computer games and videophones are nothing but a 
concoction of industries trying to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has called me," Vrba said, "and asked me whether I want to order pizza 
via my television set." And even if someone did ask, he said, he can't see 
paying for such a service. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman says she is fed up with all the cyber talk, especially the puns: 
"road kill on the information superhighway," "stalled in the breakdown lane," 
"merging into electronic traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope everybody on the information superhighway gets a flat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell, one of the main builders of the road to tomorrow, has apparently 
heard what the skeptics are saying. It recently came out with a TV advertising 
campaign about the "communications superhighway." The commercial's tag line 
tells viewers, "It's real, California." 
</P>
<P>
 If there weren't disbelief, would we need that reassurance? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Aaron Goldberg, executive vice president of Computer Intelligence 
InfoCorp. in Santa Clara: "Information superhighway? Have you ever dealt with 
the phone company? The words aggressive , dynamic and change-oriented do not 
spring to mind."

JOURNEY ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; AN INTERACTIVE HEAVEN FOR THE COUCH 
POTATO, COMPUTER WHIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By the new millennium, Orange County residents will live in the electronic 
neighborhoods of cyberspace. Think of it as a heaven for computer nerds and 
couch potatoes -- or rather mouse potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is likely to be divided like a patchwork quilt, with phone 
companies, cable- and satellite-TV broadcasters and their wireless competitors 
all claiming a section. They will offer services far more interactive than 
anything available today. 
</P>
<P>
 Video-game players will be able to do far more than shoot at targets moving 
across a screen. They will be able to execute sophisticated strategies against 
long-distance opponents who will be visible in a corner of the screen by 
videophone. 
</P>
<P>
 Movies will be non-linear, with no set beginning or ending. The viewer will be 
able to maneuver through the story line at his or her own pace. 
</P>
<P>
 TV viewers will be able to customize programming -- tuning in to only their 
favorite channels, for instance, or editing a collage of favorite chase scenes 
from spy movies and changing the endings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could push a 'fav' button to tell the smart software that a show should 
be on your favorite list," said Doug Patton, president of Patton Design, an 
Irvine company that designs remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
 News shows could work the same way. If a viewer chooses not to watch certain 
parts of a broadcast, he or she will be able to skip to the next story. 
</P>
<P>
 And if all goes as planned, such services will be inexpensive and simple, 
rather than complicated by techno-babble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be so easy that 95% of the public can use it," said Brandt 
Thompson, an industrial designer at Patton. "The challenge is personifying the 
information so that it's usable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Navigating through 500 or more TV channels could be nightmarish without the 
right tools, those in the communications industry say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really want more control, not a greater volume of information," said 
Bruce Ryon, multimedia analyst at Dataquest Inc., a San Jose market researcher. 
"Overwhelmingly, in our surveys, people already feel they're inundated with 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Ease of access, however, raises social issues. If interactive sex -- something 
like video 900 numbers -- is available, will there be gatekeepers who require 
that remote controls be made childproof so that youngsters can only watch 
G-rated programs? 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Goldberg, executive vice president of Computer Intelligence InfoCorp in 
Santa Clara, said he thinks the most popular services will be "late-night 
stuff," or adult entertainment, and gambling or lottery systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex has helped to advance new technologies before. X-rated videos, for 
example, drove sales of the first videocassette recorders, analysts say, 
because they allowed people to watch explicit scenes in privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is that grass-roots video programming such as local news and 
live coverage of city council meetings might be priced out of the market. That 
issue might be addressed as new regulations are developed to police traffic on 
the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the legislation is written right, small companies and individuals could 
put things out on channels even if there is no financial return," said Rob 
Kling, professor of computer science at UC Irvine. "You could get more diverse 
programming than 300 different sitcoms."

JOURNEY ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; BUSINESSES SEE VIDEO MEETINGS AS 
CHEAP, QUICK AND EFFECTIVE

 Aaron Goldberg figures he's eaten enough airplane peanuts to sink a 
battleship. 
</P>
<P>
 As executive vice president of Computer Intelligence InfoCorp., a market 
research firm in Santa Clara, he travels often. And he is eager for the day 
when video conference systems will make it possible for him to stay home more. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's appealing to frequent fliers like me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Video conferencing will cut business expenses in many ways, Goldberg said. His 
human resources staff, for example, will no longer have to make trips to the 
company's two-employee office in Portland, Ore., to explain policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the technology becomes available later in this decade, video conferencing 
will become increasingly popular among businesses, cities and schools, industry 
observers say. It will probably be too expensive for home use, but it will 
offer potential savings for companies with big travel budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Training programs could also be conducted electronically. When a company 
launches a product, the headquarters could broadcast a video to its entire 
sales force in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses are already pushing ahead. Three partners -- Digital Equipment 
Corp., Dimension Cable Services and Arizona State University -- have created a 
test network that electronically links some Phoenix manufacturers with their 
subcontractors and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The network allows the contractors to bid on jobs, send purchase orders and 
revise product specifications, all electronically. The users can send and 
receive both text and images, including complicated two- and three-dimensional 
computer-aided design (CAD) drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first user was McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses may be interested, too. 
</P>
<P>
 David Carroll, a Garden Grove computer animator, spends at least $8.95 a month 
to send electronic mail or get technical help through CompuServe. He said he 
would also like to use the on-line service to seek new customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd want to provide my own service as a small business connecting with 
customers," Carroll said. "With 500 channels, there would be room for things 
like that. But it all depends on the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities are already experimenting with two-way communication. Part of 
Garden Grove's traffic signal system, for example, is coordinated 
electronically through a system created by Paragon Cable. And both Fountain 
Valley and Garden Grove control their water distribution through another 
Paragon system. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, some elementary schools have used interactive cable for years to 
teach the English as a Second Language program. 
</P>
<P>
 A big concern about video conferences, though, is how to ensure privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel L. Wilkening, chancellor of UC Irvine, said an administrative video 
conference she set up was intercepted, and the information was leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we're ever going to do that again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Safi U. Qureshey, chief executive of AST Research Inc. in Irvine, said 
security systems will evolve. And he noted that banks have kept their two-way 
electronic-fund transactions secure for years.

JOURNEY ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; SIMPLICITY FOR THE MASSES; THE FOCUS 
IS ON MAKING INTERACTIVE SERVICES CHEAPER, EASIER TO USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nobody wants to maneuver through a computer maze just to watch a movie. But if 
the builders of the information superhighway package their services well, using 
them will be easier than driving to the neighborhood video store. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively few people use the interactive services that are already available 
because they are complicated, limited in capacity, costly -- or just boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of this information is around in written form now, but people don't 
use it," said Doug Patton, president of industrial design firm Patton Design in 
Irvine. "The focus should be on how new services can be used for greater 
simplicity, ease of use and personification of technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Patton's firm has developed several remote controls, including one for Time 
Warner Inc.'s test of interactive services later this year in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the main services that will be offered in Orange County this year and 
beyond. Some will be new; others will be packaged more conveniently. MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys show that movies on demand -- being able to order any movie from a 
huge library and have it appear on a home screen instantaneously -- will be the 
most popular service on interactive TV. Consumers will prefer to watch programs 
at their leisure rather than search through 500 channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial systems won't offer instant service. However, Pacific Bell will test a 
concept, dubbed near-movies-on-demand, in Milpitas this spring in which it will 
air recent box office hits every half-hour. Customers will be able to tune to 
whichever channel starts showing the film at the time they prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable companies and DirecTv, which plans to offer 150 channels by satellite, 
are intent on providing a similar service, designed as an alternative to 
renting movies from video stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to success will be keeping prices low, said analyst Bruce Ryon at 
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. Surveys show that consumers don't want to pay more 
than the $4 average video-store rental fee price or more than $20 a month for 
movies on demand. VIDEO GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Besides movies, video games seem to be a star attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cable-TV stations will offer the Sega Channel when it debuts this year. 
The channel will allow home users to download games through their TV sets to 
their video-game systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Sega will test its service in 12 markets first to iron out its pricing 
structure. It will be available in Orange County and the rest of the nation 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 For perhaps $15.95 a month, subscribers could access $2,000 worth of games, 
said Tim Bajarin, chief analyst of Creative Strategies International, a 
multimedia consulting firm in San Jose.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Sega Channel will only make games available; it will not be 
interactive. Players won't be able to compete with each other long distance, 
mainly because the technology is not widely available yet for games to be 
played without tedious delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Players can already square off on multiplayer networks such as Genie's Air 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Wilson, editor of Computer Gaming World magazine in Anaheim Hills, 
regularly squares off on the Air Warrior multiplayer air combat game on his 
home computer. He has never met in person most of his fellow pilots, but he 
meets them in cyberspace via computer modem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interaction between humans is where the games become interesting," he 
said. "You're playing against someone who is thinking. There are some 
phenomenal tele-communities on the networks. You even have the equivalent of 
roving gangs protecting their turf." ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe and other on-line computer services have attracted more than 4 
million subscribers nationwide, partly because of a feature known as electronic 
mail. Messages can be sent from one computer screen to another instantaneously, 
allowing people to correspond without using "snail mail," or regular postal 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Such communication appeals to many people who enjoy chatting with others far 
away under the anonymity of different "handles" used by citizens-band radio 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Others see the potential for taking part electronically in the democratic 
process by setting up, say, interactive school board meetings at which 
officials would receive and answer questions by E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 By the middle of 1995, Pacific Bell will be offering videophone service to the 
first homes in Orange County on its new fiber-optic network. Their usefulness 
will be limited, however, until large numbers of people own them. Videophones 
are available now but send and receive their signals very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulations do not allow phone companies to provide video programming 
now, but several bills now moving through Congress would change the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable-TV companies also have plans to offer videophone service once they 
upgrade their networks. HOME SHOPPING 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping by television now is tedious -- it can take hours for something to 
show up on the screen that the viewer might want to order. 
</P>
<P>
 But as screen navigation systems are developed and more channels are offered, 
viewers will eventually be able to peruse entire video catalogues at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Such service won't be available for a few years until the networks have enough 
storage capacity for libraries of catalogues. INTERACTIVE MEDIA 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Cable News Network and Headline News, viewers are accustomed to 
watching the latest events on TV around the clock. And America Online, a 
fast-growing on-line service with 600,000 subscribers, is already delivering 
the San Jose Mercury News to subscribers almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, viewers will be able to pause the evening newscast in mid-sentence 
and skip to the next story if they want; or pre-program the broadcast so that 
they receive only stories on a particular topic, such as finance or sports. 
</P>
<P>
 If such services can be offered at low prices, as advocates hope, almost 
everyone will be able to become a publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 David Scott Lewis, an Irvine resident and editor of an electronic magazine 
distributed on the worldwide computer network known as the Internet, hopes 
eventually to offer an electronic magazine with video images. Right now, the 
network can accommodate only text files and still pictures.
