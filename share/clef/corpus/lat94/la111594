 Royal mistreatment?Al Utter of Agoura points out that just before Prince 
Charles' visit to L.A., the Wall Street Journal ran a "Fairy-Tales for Sale" 
real estate ad, which included a property labeled: 
</P>
<P>
 "Castle with royal stud." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what the Journal's wording might have led readers to think, it wasn't 
Windsor Castle. This site -- and horse farm -- was located in Germany. We're 
not sure who's minding the palace there.

 Covering up Fido: The latest edition of Journal of the Senses, the publication 
of the Elysium Institute nudist colony in Topanga, carries "a Special Christmas 
Offer for Bare Bear Lovers." It's a set of cassettes featuring Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
 We were offended by the ad because we once belonged to the Society for 
Indecency to Naked Animals (SINA), whose purpose was to improve the moral 
climate by clothing all of God's creatures, including the four-legged ones. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in the early 1960s, SINA had a reported membership of 40,000, a 
board of directors, a theme song, a set of official animal-clothing patterns, 
and a magazine (which linked animal nudity and juvenile delinquency). 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it was not destined for glory. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Chronicle reported a SINA raid on the Children's Petting Zoo 
in Golden Gate Park in which President G. Clifford Prout Jr. and two other men 
"tried unsuccessfully to hitch a pair of white panties on (the) hindquarters" 
of a fawn. Onlooking children "screamed with joy and one little boy fell off 
the fence laughing," the Chronicle added.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, as the book "Publicity Stunt" notes, G. Clifford Prout Jr. was 
later unmasked as comedy writer-actor Buck Henry. And one of his assistants 
turned out to be Alan Abel, a free-lance media hoaxer who would later promote 
several other fictional events, including the the World Sex Olympics, in which 
couples were to compete for points on style and endurance.

 We thought even the animals were clothed there: Gene Mestel of Glendale was 
surprised to see a local newspaper describe Monday's Ovation Award ceremonies 
for theater excellence as "an optional-dress evening." 
</P>
<P>
 For non-juror eyes only: Shirley Hershey of La Mirada came across this product 
label that made her wonder if everyone's caught up in the O.J. Simpson case. 
miscelLAny Pity the poor L.A. Clippers. Not only are they winless, but when 
they played in the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim the other night, they were 
surrounded by floor-level ads that seemed to mock them. The ads were for B.U.M. 
clothing.

FLEISS TARGETED BY ROGUE STING, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HORN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heidi Fleiss was targeted by a rogue sting operation marked by lies and 
governed by desperation, her attorney said Monday in opening statements at the 
alleged Hollywood madam's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The police undercover operation was "a baloney story . . . shrewdly calculated 
by the police to slowly and surely entice our client into committing a criminal 
act," Fleiss' attorney, Donald Marks, said in his opening statement to a 
Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The deception that led to her pandering arrest included policemen claiming to 
be business titans and asking that an alleged Fleiss prostitute bring the 
undercover officers cocaine, Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter, after a brief opening statement, called to the 
stand Sammy Lee, an undercover Beverly Hills police officer. He played for the 
jury a videotape in which Lee met with Fleiss and alleged prostitute Peggy 
Schinke to arrange for four girls to entertain Lee's fictitious business 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the history of this business, in one year, no one has ever been able to do 
what I do," Fleiss says on the videotape. "I know 1%, the wealthiest people . . 
. and of all the girls that I select that are gonna work for me, maybe I meet 
100 girls, maybe in two weeks, and I only pick one." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the tape, Fleiss arranged for four prostitutes, each of whom 
would be paid $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, posing as Hawaiian businessman Miko Akai, asks, "And for $1,500, what are 
we talking?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss responds on the tape, "We're talking about everyone's gonna have a good 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss goes on to say she is a "firm believer in condoms" and "some guys like 
two girls to be together," and it can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense told the seven-man, five-woman jury that the police operation 
lured Fleiss to the videotaped meeting with a series of deceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers "created a crime when one didn't exist," Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over several months in repeated telephone calls, police deceived Fleiss and 
led her to break the state's pandering laws, which prohibit procuring women for 
prostitution, the defense maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 The sting operation was flawed, Marks said, because it was "so focused on 
arresting our client that they pursued her."

 My humble congrats to Stephen Braun for a story well-written, "Tuning Out the 
Hype and Gore" (Nov. 2), concerning the seemingly senseless, sometimes grisly 
video we see every night on television newscasts. I guess I'm part of the 
problem -- I have been a TV news cameraman in Los Angeles for 14 years but 
would have to agree that airing shots that play to viewers for shock value is 
irresponsible and wrong.The news media have fed off others' tragedy and 
misfortune long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Local and network news shows need to stop and consider what is sensational 
video and what pictures may give the viewing audience an understanding of the 
day's happenings. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot of good news out there.

A JUDGE'S ON-CAMERA PROCEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a newspaper that likes to publish interviews with important people in the 
news, we would be the last to suggest that government officials shouldn't talk 
to the media. But we think there's a time and a place for everything, and we'll 
bet we weren't the only ones left speechless when it was announced last week 
that Judge Lance A. Ito himself was about to appear in a five-part interview on 
a local television station. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito no doubt gave the interview in good faith, and steered clear of anything 
germane to the O. J. Simpson case. And no doubt he can argue that there's a big 
difference between good media coverage and bad coverage; and that an interview 
with the presiding judge about his life causes no harm and perhaps interests 
people in a jurist and his experiences and the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough but, still, here is someone talking about this, that and the other 
who is presiding over a case in which overheated media coverage has been such 
an issue that at one point he threatened to have the television camera yanked 
from the courtroom. Now he adds to the media attention by agreeing to sit for a 
TV interview. And the station, naturally, is promoting it to the hilt, which is 
its absolute right but which only adds to the steam. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Ito is a newsworthy figure, and ordinarily we couldn't be more 
supportive of openness by public officials. But, given his own impassioned 
concerns about the atmosphere in which the trial is being conducted, we can't 
help thinking it would have been more consistent and seemly for him to have 
waited until the trial was completed before going on camera.

FREE TRADE OR PROTECTIONISM?; AT SUMMIT OF PACIFIC NATIONS, THAT'S THE QUESTION 
OF THE HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the end of the Cold War, the Clinton Administration has tried to make 
U.S. economic interests the centerpiece of foreign policy, at least in the 
Asia-Pacific region. That is smart, considering that Asia is the world's 
fastest-growing economic region and U.S. trade across the Pacific dwarfs its 
commerce with Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The second summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, in Indonesia 
this week, has underlined the changing relationship of the United States with 
its Pacific trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday President Clinton won promises from China, Japan and South Korea to 
keep pressure on North Korea to not develop nuclear weapons. Any reminder to 
Pyongyang of the forces arrayed against it on this vital issue is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also said properly that it will raise the question of human 
rights with China and Indonesia, but in private meetings. Clinton expressed 
sympathy for the students who scaled the fence of the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta 
and occupied the grounds to protest Indonesian policy in East Timor, annexed by 
Indonesia in 1976. That was the right approach; Indonesia's annexation of the 
former Portuguese colony has never been recognized by the United Nations. 
Although Washington cannot tell its partners what to do, neither must it shrink 
from the championing of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Summit conferences with as many participants as the APEC session by nature 
produce only promises of cooperation, vague timetables and rivers of rhetoric. 
And that is when they are successful. When things do not go well, we are 
treated to the kind of awkwardness that resulted at last year's APEC summit 
when Clinton met with China's president after being stonewalled on human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while the gathering of leaders of 18 nations, plus a plethora of aides, 
invariably demonstrates frictions as much as common interests, such 
face-to-face meetings are valuable. That is especially true when two or three 
heads of government break away to meet privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's APEC summit opened in Seattle as Clinton was winning a cliffhanger 
victory for the North American Free Trade Agreement. He was able to appear as a 
leader capable of persuading followers of the benefits of free trade. This year 
he appeared as a President trounced in last week's elections, and White House 
aides conceded that the other leaders had searching questions about what that 
meant for their relations with Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 That is a natural question, but the leaders of other democracies present in 
Jakarta know that their fortunes, too, can change at the polls. And even for 
the authoritarian regimes in China and Indonesia, with aging top officials, 
there are questions about what course future leaders will take -- among them 
free trade or protectionism.

BOSNIAN ARMS: IT'S NOW A KILLER QUESTION; THE SO-CALLED MERE 'CIVIL WAR' THAT 
NOW THREATENS THE WESTERN ALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relations between the United States and its NATO allies, particularly the 
British, have become progressively more strained over Bosnia in recent months. 
But a critical point may have been reached last Saturday when the Clinton 
Administration terminated U.S. participation in the enforcement of a 
U.N.-imposed Bosnian arms embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's action has little to do with generally tense relations 
between Prime Minister John Major's Tory government and his own Democratic 
Administration. While it is true that Tories usually get on better with 
Republicans than with Democrats (Tory Margaret Thatcher and Republican Ronald 
Reagan got on famously), Bosnia is creating an exception to that rule. For the 
Clinton Administration's Bosnia policy, however clearly at odds with British 
policy, differs less than the policy that will be pursued by the incoming 
Republican majority in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The point most at issue is the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations on 
all of the former Yugoslavia. Because Serbs dominated the former federation 
and, in particular, controlled its military, they retained control of the 
federation's arsenal, and the blanket embargo has had a grossly uneven effect, 
favoring Serb aggression and retarding Bosnian defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Republicans are determined to go beyond non-enforcement to a 
unilateral U.S. breach of the embargo, claiming that only when Bosnia has armed 
for its self-defense can further Serb aggression be deterred. They may well 
attempt to force Clinton's hand with binding legislation. America's NATO allies 
want the embargo maintained, claiming that peace can best be reached by 
ratifying most of the early Serb conquests and, in any event, by preventing 
arms from being shipped to any of the warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress' view that Serb aggression must be halted by the stick rather than 
the carrot is, in our judgment, the more realistic path to peace, but realism 
has also seemed to dictate that the United States not pursue a European policy 
in defiance of Britain, France and even Germany, (not to speak of Russia, which 
with the four main NATO powers has formed a "Contact Group" vainly attempting 
to piece together a common Balkans policy). 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration faces a dilemma that probably cannot be resolved 
unless the U.N. Security Council itself chooses to lift the embargo. The 
Europeans will resist any U.S. attempt to persuade the council to take this 
step, and a Russian veto is likely if less than certain. Still, facing a 
hawkish Republican majority in Congress, the Administration would be well 
advised to try harder than it has hitherto to find the Security Council votes 
it needs. 
</P>
<P>
 If it fails to find them, it is just possible that the embargo dispute may 
herald a phase-out of NATO itself as a factor in European security. The NATO 
allies have placed themselves in a lose-lose position as regards the 
preservation of the alliance. If, on the one hand, they force the United States 
to back down and to help them maintain the embargo, the Americans, particularly 
the Republicans, will infer that NATO lacks the will to confront Russia on 
anything smaller than a life-or-death issue. And since, on such an issue, 
Europe is well able to defend itself without American help, NATO will be seen 
to have outlived its usefulness. If, on the other hand, the Clinton 
Administration refuses to back down and, under congressional pressure, breaks 
the embargo unilaterally, the rupture in NATO will only come quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the United States sacrifice NATO to its Bosnia policy? Or will the NATO 
allies sacrifice NATO to theirs? Who needs NATO more? Intransigence on both 
sides, helped along by a Russian veto in the Security Council, may yet succeed 
in fragmenting an alliance that held up through all the strains of the Cold 
War, a remarkable consequence of what some persist in calling a mere civil war.

GOP CONTROL OF CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Humorist Will Rogers said, "I don't belong to any organized political party. I 
am a Democrat." Former Democratic governor of Colorado Richard Lamm once said, 
"When Democrats assemble a firing squad, they form a circle." 
</P>
<P>
 I find The Times' pessimism about the ability of a Republican Congress to 
govern unfounded (editorial, Nov. 10). Gridlock during the Reagan-Bush years 
and during the first two years of Clinton's Administration came about because 
the Democratic Party, as has historically been its custom, lacked discipline. 
Ronald Reagan's most productive years -- 1981 to 1986 -- came about because he 
had a cohesive, disciplined Republican Senate to help implement his agenda -- 
in spite of a hostile House of Representatives held hostage by the opposing 
party. Voters in 1994 did not defeat a single Republican running for 
reelection; America voted for a change in direction, not a change for change 
sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I am no longer a Republican and have fundamental problems with many 
of the party's most extreme positions, I look forward to this historical 
change. The Republicans, by virtue of this stunning victory itself, demonstrate 
they can at least organize well and avoid shooting themselves in the process. 
It's a promising start.  
</P>

 Regarding the Nov. 11 article on Rep. Bill Archer's (R-Tex.) proposals: Does 
he know that it costs five times as much to put a child in a foster home than 
it does to pay welfare support for a child living at home? Of course he does, 
and the fact that he still wants to take children away from their mothers tells 
us that he is a racist -- he's certainly not proposing it for sound economic 
reasons but is, clearly, appealing to bigotry.  
</P>
<P>
 And capital gains reduction? Before the Republicans start telling us again, as 
they did in '92, that Germany has virtually no capital gains tax, please remind 
readers that Germany can do that because it has a very sharply progressive 
income tax.

 * On Nov. 3, 1992, then President-elect Bill Clinton said, "We're all in this 
together, and we will rise or fall together." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 8, 1994, the American people decided not to fall with President 
Clinton. They sent a clear message to him and all his liberal friends in 
Congress. This message was not about anti-incumbency, because no Republican 
senator, house member, or governor lost their reelections. Instead, this was a 
referendum on Bill Clinton and his liberal agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The electorate has given the Republican Party a mandate to make government 
smaller, cut spending, reform welfare and cut taxes. Now, the GOP will have 
control of both houses. If they don't deliver on their "Contract With America," 
the next voter revolution may be on them. 
</P>
<P>
 DANIEL GUIMERA 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 * On Nov. 8, America's voters overwhelmingly endorsed the Republican Party's 
"Contract With America." With a view to balancing the federal budget, I have 
analyzed the 1993 budget; estimated federal receipts were $1,145.6 billion. 
Major expenditure programs mandated by law or public policy include Social 
Security, interest on the public debt, national defense, Medicare and 
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to balance the federal budget, the following programs would have to 
be eliminated: international aid, housing subsidies, food and nutrition, 
health, education, commerce, transportation, natural resources, energy, 
community development, agriculture, science and space. So we would privatize 
the post office and eliminate federal insurance on bank deposits. Rent 
subsidies for low-income seniors and the "Meals on Wheels" food program would 
be history. There would be no more federal highway construction and 
maintenance, because the transportation excise taxes (highway, air and water) 
would have to be eliminated and replaced by new income taxes to fund other 
mandated spending. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no money to pay for disaster relief and farm income 
stabilization would stop. The space program would end. Our national parks would 
be closed to the public. We wouldn't spend any more money to provide nutrition, 
health and education services to young children. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that every American needs to be told now the magnitude of spending 
cuts and the program impacts implicit in a balanced budget. Sen. Bob Dole, Rep. 
Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh have told us how the government already has 
enough of our money. So gentlemen, put up or shut up! Tell the American people 
how your revenue neutral plan will balance with federal expenditures. I'll bet 
my children's future income you can't do it.

<P>
 * As a white male of the boomer generation, I have one challenge to the 
incoming Republican-led Congress. Fix Social Security now. They'll forever earn 
my respect if they can balance that budget without voodoo economics and 
worthless government IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, I say they're just a bunch of whining, self-serving wimps unwilling 
to tackle the one foreseeable problem that promises to dwarf any other future 
budgetary shortage, including health care. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM DeBUSSEY 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 * I've got a suggestion for President Clinton, now that he appears to be 
surrounded by his political adversaries: Why doesn't he become a Republican? 
Democrats would finally be able to get their legislation passed because 
Republicans would have to support the agenda of their party's leader. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also take a lot of steam out of Dole and and other Republicans' 
presidential ambitions -- they'd have to get past an incumbent President to 
gain the party's nomination in 1996.

<P>
 Late in the day on Nov. 8, after the White House officially accepted a 
resignation letter I had submitted the previous week, a wire story mistakenly 
reported that my letter had attacked Republicans for unrelenting partisanship. 
The story caught up with me several hours later in Seoul, Korea, where I was 
traveling with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Upon hearing from me, the 
reporter filed an amended story showing that I had not criticized the GOP; 
indeed, my only mention of Republicans was in observing that I had "proudly 
served" three Republican presidents before joining the Clinton Administration. 
Unfortunately the amended story reached The Times too late for publication, and 
the erroneous story appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 To set the record straight, I have said on several occasions including a 
recent speech at the Reagan Library, that bipartisanship has flourished more 
than once in Washington of late. Republicans deserve far more praise than they 
have received for providing the decisive margin of victory for passage of the 
NAFTA treaty.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, there have been many, many other times when bipartisanship 
has given way to poisonous rancor. Both parties -- not to mention 
special-interest groups as well as the press -- bear responsibility for the way 
our politics has degenerated. As someone who has been in government as well as 
the press, I share in that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent elections provide an opportunity to turn a page. President Clinton 
has offered to work with Republicans in a constructive spirit; Sen. Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) have made similar offers from their 
side. Of course tough fights lie ahead because the philosophical differences 
are deep and real. But each of these gentlemen cares about the country's fate, 
so that on vital issues, it should be possible to reach common ground. 
Ultimately, that common ground can be higher ground.

 It was with some surprise that I read about the demise of Eric Chaim Kline, 
Bookseller in Stephen Games' Oct. 16 commentary, "Superstores, Narrowed 
Choices," which reviews the impact of superstores on the Los Angeles book 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 To set the record straight, my store at 1343 4th St. in Santa Monica was 
destroyed by the Jan. 17 Los Angeles earthquake and not by the competition of 
the superstores. Within two weeks of the quake we were operating out of an 
office -- now moved to LAX -- and have been available by appointment, filling 
special orders, responding to our clients' needs, and reachable by phone at our 
old number, which is still listed and in force.

COLUMN LEFT/ DONELLA H. MEADOWS: HOW TO CURE OUR COSTLY ADDICTIONS; IN HEALTH 
CARE AND WELFARE, WE MUST BUILD UP SELF-RELIANCE, NOT SPEW BLAME AND BILE.

 Talk radio while driving west on Oklahoma 51 just before the election. On 
comes the Republican candidate for governor: Some people are just bad and can't 
be fixed. There's a line, and when someone crosses it, there's no room for 
mercy. Put 'em in jail. Execute 'em.  
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma folks call in: People will take any handout they can get. There are 
two kinds in the world, the self-reliant ones and the ones that live for 
handouts. Stop the handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 America's declining standard of living is spilling out in ugliness. We need 
someone to blame, someone we can feel superior to, even when we ourselves don't 
feel very high. The obvious targets are those who won't talk back, those who 
have been hurt most, those who don't look like us. It doesn't matter that 
there's no logic behind our blame or our prescriptions. Those folks can't be 
fixed, so let's preach at them. We won't pay for their schools, but we'll put 
out millions for their prisons.  
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Congress sweeps into office on this tide of bile. The mean mood 
is a national tragedy, because we do have broken people, families and 
communities, and they need real fixing, not spleen-venting simplicities.  
</P>
<P>
 Before they got vengeful, conservatives had some useful points to make about 
welfare. Government "help" is too often guilt-assuaging gesture. It creates 
layers of wasteful bureaucracy. Too much help of the wrong sort creates a 
culture of dependency that swamps our ability to provide.  
</P>
<P>
 We start with a real problem. The poor can't afford doctors, for example. 
Rather than ask why people are so poor or doctors are so expensive, we step in 
with a kindly government program. We'll subsidize health care.  
</P>
<P>
 That works for awhile. But it suppresses other solutions, especially those 
that might have been invented by people, communities, local organizations. And 
the subsidy does nothing to encourage health-care providers, with a huge 
government purse to dip into, to contain costs. Both the providers and the 
recipients of the program become addicts.  
</P>
<P>
 Addiction is a strong word, but an accurate one. We've gone for the quick fix 
that dulls the pain but allows the under-lying problems -- poverty and bloated 
health-care costs -- to get worse. So we spend more money, our drug of choice, 
to go on disguising symptoms. The money attracts more people into the system 
and keeps them there longer. It encourages health-care providers to make their 
services lavish, sometimes even corrupt. More and more money is needed, until 
the system breaks down in unaffordability and blame.  
</P>
<P>
 That's the conservative analysis, and it's right. But here's where the liberal 
analysis is right: It doesn't help to tell addicts to go cold turkey. There 
were good reasons why the poor were not able to solve their problems in the 
first place. After generations of addiction, those reasons have only deepened.  
</P>
<P>
 The kind of support the down-and-out need is the kind we have always refused 
them, the kind that would mean engaging with them not as objects of contempt, 
but as fellow human beings. The only answer to addiction is to build up the 
self-reliance of the addict. That takes time and understanding, not blame and 
bile. Not two years and you're off. Not passing the burden of health care 
around from government to employers to the poor themselves like a hot potato.  
</P>
<P>
 Any 12-step program can tell you that no addict is beyond fixing, that no one 
can fix anyone else and that no one can fix himself or herself alone. The 
recovering addict needs constant, tough support, relentless honesty and the 
surrender of personal will to some higher power, even if that higher power is 
no more than a group of other recovering addicts. That's a more complex, 
compassionate and proven formula than the simplistic conservative agenda -- and 
it's not one that government can provide.  
</P>
<P>
 But government can encourage, with money, law and rhetoric, the people and 
organizations that do provide non-addictive, capacity-building support. It can 
stop the recriminations and the false choices, such as the choice between 
prevention and punishment, when we need both.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether the problem is health care or crime, welfare or teen pregnancy, drugs 
or urban blight, that problem cannot be solved while people live in 
desperation. This country is rich enough to end desperation; in fact its 
poverty is the main factor undercutting its richness. Ending poverty calls for 
humility, honesty, freedom from ideology and refusal to accept cruel 
simplicities about anyone's human potential. It requires listening to the 
wisdom and cutting the nonsense from both the right and the left.

PERSPECTIVE ON PROPOSITION 187; A 'PEOPLE' TREATY URGENTLY NEEDED; IMMIGRATION 
WAS THE ONE ISSUE NAFTA SKIRTED; U.S., MEXICO MUST FACE IT BEFORE CALIFORNIANS' 
LOATHING GOES NATIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE DRESSER, Denise Dresser, a professor of political science at the 
Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, is currently a visiting fellow at 
the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Mexico now have one more thing in common: discontent 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year ago, the North American Free Trade Agreement was hailed as 
the advent of multifaceted collaboration between the two countries. 
California's passage last week of Proposition 187 flies in the face of that 
cooperative vision. When voters shouted loud and clear "Mexicans, go home!" 
they demonstrated the depths of resentment Californians feel toward the 
burgeoning Mexican presence. 
</P>
<P>
 California's use of a ballot initiative to deny state-funded services to 
undocumented immigrants underscored the lack of leadership on the immigration 
issue. Unless Washington makes immigration a matter for bilateral attention, 
the Proposition 187 debacle will jeopardize the future of U.S.-Mexico 
relations, the electoral prospects of the Democratic Party and the very spirit 
of North American integration. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-Mexican sentiment, fueled by the reelection campaign of Republican 
Gov. Pete Wilson, caught Presidents Bill Clinton and Carlos Salinas unprepared. 
During the marketing of NAFTA, both presidents lobbied intensively, cut 
back-room deals, courted constituencies on both sides of the border, wooed 
labor and environmental advocates and invested substantial amounts of political 
capital for the sake of free trade. In order to assure the safe passage of the 
treaty, they left the thorniest issue on the integration agenda -- immigration 
-- unaddressed. As Proposition 187 grew in appeal north of the border, Salinas 
was devoting his attention to his post-presidency career. Clinton's response 
was the so-called Operation Guardian, which focused on adding to the Border 
Patrol, a haphazard policy that proved to be too little, too late. The 
shortsightedness on both sides of the border will be paid for by the thousands 
of Mexicans living under the Damocles sword of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 This first NAFTA backlash in the ballot box suggests that for many 
Californians, collaboration with Mexico should be limited to trade and 
deportation. Many of those who voted in favor of 187 said that they did so to 
"send a message" to the federal government. What they failed to realize is that 
in the era of U.S.-Mexico interdependence, domestic politics have become a 
bilateral affair. The "message" sounds like entrenched racism to Mexicans, who 
now view 187 as yet another example of the imperial attitudes that fueled the 
invasions and interventions of the past. Proposition 187 is not perceived in 
Mexico as a California-specific, faulty piece of legislation that will probably 
die in the courts, but as nothing short of betrayal by an untrustworthy ally.  
</P>
<P>
 Unless the immigration issue is tackled in a constructive way, Mexico and the 
United States will probably revert to a historic cycle of confrontation and 
recrimination. Mexican and U.S. leaders who fought for NAFTA now have the 
political responsibility to hammer out a binational accord that goes beyond 
trade: an immigration agreement that both sides can live with. Instead of 
engaging in ineffectual nationalist posturing, incoming President Ernesto 
Zedillo should assemble a team of immigration negotiators who are as savvy and 
successful as their NAFTA trade counterparts and beckon the Clinton 
Administration to the bargaining table. Instead of wallowing in self-doubt and 
despair, the Democrats should seize the opportunity to develop a binational 
immigration policy that could unite their party's divided ranks. By taking the 
lead on immigration policy, wounded Democrats might recover the initiative they 
handed over to Republican Mexico-bashers, who would like nothing more than to 
poison the bilateral relationship.  
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives in the United States have realized that the immigration issue 
can be an effective political battle horse, and in all likelihood, they will 
attempt to use it to storm the White House in 1996. Unless Proposition 187 is 
stopped dead in its tracks, the fear and loathing that marked California's 
election season will become the trademark of the next presidential campaign. 
Anti-Mexico sentiments could easily spill over into the Southwest, breeding 
political polarization and bringing to an end a short-lived period of harmony 
in U.S.-Mexico relations. 
</P>
<P>
 If its advocates were correct, if NAFTA was about creating a new partnership 
between Mexico and the United States, Proposition 187 is its first real test. 
NAFTA was conceived to avoid discrimination against goods. A U.S.-Mexico treaty 
on immigration should be devised to prevent discrimination against people. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Mexico border has often been described as an open wound. NAFTA was 
expected to heal it, albeit through a long, slow and imperfect scarring 
process, by creating a basic framework for cooperation between the two 
countries. But if California's intemperance inaugurates yet another era in 
which, to paraphrase Martin Luther King, men, women and children are judged not 
by the content of their character but by the color of their skin, the wound 
that binds Mexico and the United States may never heal.

COLUMN RIGHT/ SUSAN CARPENTER MCMILLAN: ULTRA-LIBERALS FIGHT MORALITY IN THE 
SCHOOLS; HEMET PROGRAM IS A LOGICAL ANSWER TO PREGNANCY AND STDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With teen-age pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketing, the 
sex-education program adopted by the Hemet School District should become a 
prototype for every school district in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hemet program, which promotes abstinence, begins by placing the primary 
responsibility for teaching children about sex on parents and the secondary 
role on schools. The Hemet school board researched three established and 
recognized abstinence programs from across the country and combined their 
findings into one.  
</P>
<P>
 The program teaches self-discipline, a sense of responsibility, self-control 
and a sound reasoning process. It also gives teens skills on how to say no, 
along with instructing them that they must never use verbal or physical 
harassment to intimidate. The study guide emphasizes "that jokes, slurs and 
derogatory statements made on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, disability, 
race, color, creed, religion or culture are demeaning and destroy the dignity 
of the affected individual." Condoms are not displayed until the 11th grade; no 
form of contraception is distributed by the school. Finally, all sex-education 
programs are age-appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Who, you ask, would ever be against this kind of balanced, informative program 
that gives our kids the only foolproof method to prevent AIDS and other STDs? 
Five sets of parents, backed by none other than the mother of promiscuity, 
Planned Parenthood, and its ultra-liberal sidekick, the American Civil 
Liberties Union. They have sued the Hemet School District and all five board 
members to stop the program.  
</P>
<P>
 Seems like teaching morality in today's climate of immorality truly brings out 
those who would live and thrive on putting our children's health and 
self-esteem at risk. For the past two decades, these anti-moral parasites have 
fostered attitudes in our schools that brought us Lakewood's infamous "Spur 
Posse," where 15-year-old boys boasted of having sex with girls as young as 10 
as part of a competition. One "Spur" mother reported stocking her 14-year-old 
son's room with condoms, while a father proudly called his son "all man."  
</P>
<P>
 These twisted attitudes instill in the minds of today's teen-agers that, like 
animals, they simply cannot control themselves. Psychiatrist Richard Bloom has 
attributed the 200% rise in teen-age suicide to the free sexual lifestyle 
practiced by today's teens. Roughly 20% of the teen-agers in a University of 
Michigan study were infected with chlamydia, and nationwide, 3 million teens a 
year become infected with STDs ranging from AIDS to syphilis. After billions of 
tax dollars spent on sex-education programs, 58% of young girls still refuse to 
use contraception during their first act of sexual intercourse.  
</P>
<P>
 This insanity -- which turns educators into advocates by allowing them to pass 
out condoms and portrays those who dare to suggest boundaries and standards as 
right-wing religious zealots -- must stop. There is no cure for AIDS; if a 
young person becomes infected, he or she will die. Yet the pro-sex evangelists 
refuse to tell children that so-called safe-sex condoms have a failure rate of 
26% in preventing AIDS and 16% in preventing pregnancy.  
</P>
<P>
 As responsible educators, the Hemet school board looked at these disturbing 
statistics and decided to institute an abstinence-based program. Now the board 
is being sued for teaching children common-sense values and self-preservation. 
Bonnie Park, who teaches "sex respect" at Hemet Middle School, says the program 
centers on "the idea that human beings really can control their behavior, 
including sexual behavior." Students support her.  
</P>
<P>
 As the mother of a 16-year-old, I challenge Planned Parenthood to give me one 
negative aspect of teaching our children to wait. Where is the flaw in teaching 
kids how to say no? Finally, can Planned Parenthood name one child who ever 
died from abstinence? Yet, in an apparently concerted effort, small groups of 
parents from around the country, apparently fronting for those who profit from 
teen-age promiscuity, are suing school systems that dare to teach abstinence.  
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey at Grand Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, 82% of the 1,043 
adolescents questioned said they wanted help in how to say no. Louis Harris' 
recent poll found that 87% of teens did not want sexual services such as birth 
control and abortion referral at their schools. Yet the do-badders plow on. 
Could it be that these middle-aged proponents of the free-love, anything-goes 
'60s are threatened by the morals their offspring are being given -- the same 
ones they rejected? The Hemet school board should be supported and imitated, 
not sued and harassed.

O.C. ART REVIEW; A 'COOL' COLLECTION OF FUNK AND FETISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the next 15 weeks, all the main-floor galleries at the Laguna Art Museum 
will be occupied by "Lit From Within: Amish Quilts of Lancaster County," an 
exhibition drawn from the collection of Esprit, a clothing design firm that has 
given the standard corporate collection of blue-chip art a touchy-feely twist. 
</P>
<P>
 The show postdates by some 20 years the art world's "discovery" of the Amish 
predilection for pleasingly austere pattern. During the past two decades, 
contemporary art has embraced such vernacular techniques as sewing, and art 
museums routinely have exhibited a wide variety of objects once considered 
"merely" craft or pop-culture castoffs. Attractive as they are, Amish quilts in 
an art context no longer are news from a stylistic or ethnographic point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you venture downstairs to the Segerstrom Family Gallery, there's a 
consolation prize: "Too Cool: Assemblage and Finish Fetish in Los Angeles" 
(through Feb. 19), a show juxtaposing two distinctive aesthetics that 
characterized forward-looking Southern California art of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No other exhibition in memory has specifically isolated the two coexisting 
styles and offered them up for Jekyll-and-Hyde comparison. It's too bad that 
this show, which curator Bolton Colburn drew entirely from the museum's 
collection, cannot offer broad inclusiveness or precise documentation of an era 
(some individuals who came of age artistically in the '60s are represented by 
later work). But the show's bigger problem is its lack of an accompanying essay 
discussing the parallel development of two such night-and-day styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblage in California was born in the Bay Area in the '50s, yet some of its 
best-known practitioners also lived in Los Angeles at some point in their 
careers. Constructed from worn-out, often vaguely unpleasant objects and 
invested with private meanings and socially conscious viewpoints, these 
pack-rat works (often called Funk Art) are at a raffish remove from their more 
stylized European forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the California assemblage artists passionately allied themselves to 
Surrealism and Dada, represented in the postwar era by such European or 
European art-steeped artists as Marcel Duchamp (whose first retrospective was 
held at the Pasadena Art Museum in 1963) and Man Ray (an L.A. resident in the 
'40s). 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace Berman, who spent nearly all his adult life in Southern California, is 
represented in this show by editions of "Semina," a sporadic, hand-printed 
project incorporating poetry by such leading lights of the Beat generation as 
Michael McClure and Allen Ginsberg and illustrations with sexual, mystical and 
drug-related themes by Berman, Jess and the ultra-reclusive Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of a few years in Northern California in the late '50s and 
early '60s, George Herms also lived in the southern part of the state. In an 
untitled piece from 1965, he recasts the floral relief decoration on a 
weathered headboard with a wizardly combination of deliciously mundane objects: 
an old webbed belt, metal brackets and trailing wisps of yellowed lace. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major figure in Southern California assemblage was the late Edward 
Kienholz, who lived in Los Angeles during the '50s, '60s and early '70s before 
decamping to Berlin and Hope, Ida. He is represented by a work from 1979, 
"Jerry Can Standard," an oil can painted in Army drab that he and his wife, 
Nancy Reddin, turned into a jury-rigged TV -- thereby suggesting an unsavory 
linkage of power and propaganda, postindustrial bread and media-age circuses. 
The show also includes work by junk sculptor Gordon Wagner and by Bruce Connor, 
the Bay Area's inimitable purveyor of furtive secrets about sex and death. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mythology that has grown up around the '60s, the assemblage artists 
were hippie types attracted to offbeat poetry, trash bins and mystical 
experiences (with or without drug intervention), while the Finish Fetish 
contingent was a carousing, clean-cut bunch all fired up about the new acrylic 
paints and resins developed for customizing automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the assemblage artists delved into the tormented psyche, documented 
outrage at the social condition or simply reveled in homespun oddity, the 
Finish Fetish artists concentrated on the ways color and reflected light made 
things look good. Assemblage art aestheticized castoff everyday objects, while 
Finish Fetish work turned an aspect of popular culture -- technological 
innovation -- into an object of aesthetic contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot yellow and red curves of DeWain Valentine's "Yellow Roller" -- a giant 
child's toy with a playfully erotic allure -- the sleek black minimalism of 
John McCracken's "Nine Planks V" and the mysterious golden orb that glimmers 
within Peter Alexander's untitled polyester resin cube are three manifestations 
of the Southern California fascination with surfaces and light effects. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two camps had anything in common, it was a shared sense of 
obsessiveness. Both knew a peculiar kind of isolation, too, at a time when 
Southern California was largely indifferent to contemporary art. Both also used 
real-world materials -- as did Pop and Primary Structure sculptors working in 
New York who turned away from the grip of Abstract Expressionism, albeit in 
distinctively different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too Cool" also includes recent work that incorporates techniques or attitudes 
associated with assemblage or Finish Fetish. Predictably, the better pieces 
transform these genres into something different, while the weaker tread the 
same old paths minus the sense of discovery that informed the originals. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of assemblage gone conceptual in a stunningly witty way is Greg 
Colson's "Uptown, Downtown, Canal Street" from 1988 -- a mailbox, a lunch box 
and a toolbox that form an abbreviated map of Manhattan and also cunningly 
stand in for perceptions of different parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, an untitled three-way collaboration on a vintage handkerchief -- by 
Bettye Saar, Jeffrey Vallance and Michael Uhlenkott -- bridges two artistic 
generations with throwaway humor, and Doug Edge's "Chatsworth Series I, Blue" 
remakes the oh-so-Southern-California side of Finish Fetish into a humorously 
literal evocation of the Pacific Ocean stuffed into a slumping, transparent 
envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Too Cool: Assemblage and Finish Fetish in Los Angeles" continues through 
Feb. 19 and "Lit From Within: Amish Quilts of Lancaster County" through Feb. 26 
at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Tuesdays through Sundays. $5 for adults; $4 for seniors and students; free for 
children under 12. (714) 494-6531.

THEATER REVIEWS; WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!; UCI PRODUCTION OF THE SHAKESPEARE 
WORK HAS AN OVERDEVELOPED SENSE OF THE EMPHATIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No detail of "As You Like It!" seems too small for director Robert Cohen to 
mull over, tinker with, and assign some potentially significant meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine's Fine Arts Village Theatre, where his postmodern staging of 
Shakespeare's pastoral comedy opened this weekend, even the title of the play 
gets an exclamation point to underscore a theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the production as a whole suffers from an overdeveloped sense 
of the emphatic. And despite dynamic moments from a large cast kept in 
perpetual motion, many of Cohen's interpretive details are just too obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Douglas-Scott Goheen's plain design of the show -- presented 
without scenery on a green runway between two tiers of seats -- makes the best 
statement because of its basic intimacy and lack of fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 What scenic elements there are consist mainly of pale brick columns at both 
ends of the runway, some yellow beach balls herded with white shepherds' crooks 
to represent sheep, and a leafy-looking cyclorama that embraces the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The costumes are a purposeful mix of the understated and the highly 
theatrical. Some characters wear outfits that could have come from the pages of 
a comic book. Others wear suits and fedoras out of the '40s. Most have on a 
motley wardrobe suggesting rural woodsmen who put themselves together with 
secondhand clothes from a Salvation Army store. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems arise when this updated production calls our attention to Cohen's 
unoriginal choices. It is no stroke of genius, for example, to signal the 
coming of fall in the Forest of Arden with a few bars of "Autumn Leaves," not 
even if it's a sendup, which of course it is. Ditto for winter's arrival and 
"Let It Snow." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, to satirize moon-struck Orlando with the tune "I Could Write a 
Book," as he pins love notes for Rosalind on the trees per Shakespeare's text, 
is corny, redundant and too cute by half. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, trying to milk laughs from the audience repeatedly with stale musical 
italics is only one of the production's wrongheaded hallmarks. Another is the 
insistence on unimaginative sight gags.  
</P>
<P>
 If you don't get the obscure allusion to '50s-era wrestling legend Gorgeous 
George from the long blond wig sported here by Charles, wrestler to Duke 
Frederick, a helpful hint is stenciled on the back of his sweat shirt. Large 
gold letters tell you this is "Comely Charles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of inspiration carries over to other choices as well. Is there a 
director alive who hasn't used badminton to show Rosalind and Celia frolicking 
on the palace lawn? The silver lining here is the scene's fine execution by 
Demetra Tseckares as Rosalind and Jennifer Paige Mazzuca as Celia. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando's lawn mower is a more original idea to illustrate his lowly chores, 
or at least one I'd never seen before. One of the few lovable concepts is the 
use of the beach balls as sheep. The image of the shepherd Corin (David 
Anderson) leading them with his crook has lasting charm, especially when they 
bleat (courtesy of music director Dennis Castellano). 
</P>
<P>
 The production also offers an entertaining showcase for Michael Thomas Holmes 
as Touchstone, the witty fool, whose flamboyant clowning includes fleeting 
impersonations of John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Richard Nixon and Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. (Maybe it's contagious. Two seasons ago, a different Touchstone 
did Elvis, Groucho and Jack Nicholson at Santa Barbara City College.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a play without much of a plot, "As You Like It!" has plenty of 
convolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad Duke Frederick, usurper of the good Duke Senior, boots Senior's 
daughter Rosalind out of his palace after raising her as a playmate for his own 
daughter, Celia. The two young women flee with Touchstone to the Forest of 
Arden, where Duke Senior is hiding out with his band of men. Rosalind disguises 
herself as a young man, Ganymede. Celia masquerades as a peasant girl, Aliena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orlando, who has fallen in love with Rosalind (and she with him), 
flees separately to the forest because his nasty elder brother Oliver, who is 
envious of him, now plans to have him killed.  
</P>
<P>
 All eventually meet in the forest and end up properly paired off in marriage, 
following a series of romantic complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare has written a commanding role in Rosalind, and any actor who plays 
her must exude intelligence, subtlety and, most of all, charisma. Tseckares 
begins with promise but tends to flatten out, not quite clinching the feminine 
allure that makes Rosalind so captivating. She loosens up, though, as the 
strutting Ganymede and acquits herself with honor. 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Gloria, well cast as Orlando, gives a very natural, persuasive 
performance grounded in restraint. He conveys sincerity without sappiness and 
doesn't reach for effects. His comfort in the role helps anchor the production 
in reality.  
</P>
<P>
 Mazzuca's vivid Celia also gives the show a big assist in that regard, as does 
Todd Denning, whose forceful Jaques seems a lot less melancholy than usual. He 
also is a bit goofy as a tree-climbing lookout, but Denning has stage presence 
as well as some of Shakespeare's most memorable lines (the great monologue on 
the seven ages of man). 
</P>
<P>
 As Amiens, tenor David Baida is notable for his affecting rendition of several 
Shakespearean songs, attractively set by composer Christine Frezza. And Tyler 
Layton shines with uncommon grace in the small role of Phoebe. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, however, this "As You Like It!" ranks as an ambitious misfire. 
Cohen revs the engine, but the show doesn't go anywhere.

DANCE REVIEW; 'BLACK CHOREOGRAPHERS': MOVING, BUT NOT PROGRESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as with opening night this year, the final Sunday afternoon program in 
the annual "Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century" festival at 
Cal State L.A. had no artistic direction to speak of -- only a commitment to 
something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, part of the first season at the new Luckman Fine Arts Complex, 
tried to build audiences by offering MTV-level cheap thrills. But it also 
wanted to showcase mainstream artists never before seen in Los Angeles and give 
local unknowns a chance to perform. And, yes, it also attempted to fulfill its 
original mission: to prove that African Americans have always been central to 
the avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 The scattershot five-part program began with "Morning Songs," a 1991 jazz 
ballet by Talley Beatty, a pioneer of African American dance. Set to hot, 
ominous music by Charles Mingus, it developed a vocabulary of technical display 
into an increasingly threatening statement of group power -- a divertissement 
with an edge, perfectly suited to the energy and flair of the Philadanco 
company from Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through: a depiction of gang rape. Ironically, Beatty's stylized sexual 
assault proved far less brutal than the supposed lovemaking in "Naked Perfume," 
the Dwight Rhoden duet for his Ohio-based Complexions company. Using a giant 
picture frame as both a design element and a support for some of the 
heavy-breathing gymnastics and contortions crammed into the piece, Rhoden 
created a deliriously sleazy nightclub adagio that ended with Antonio Carlos 
Scott pulling off Christina Johnson's top and Johnson reaching into Scott's 
shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott also supplied the music for the piece, and Johnson (a guest from Dance 
Theatre of Harlem) contributed meticulous pointe work and a sense of dignity 
that seemed positively miraculous under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Beatty's and Rhoden's balletic flamboyances came "Crow," a fluid, 
sweetly personal modern dance solo by L. Martina Young, a former fixture of the 
local scene who now lives in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece, an excerpt from "In the Company of Angels," used dance as a 
counterpoint to a text that began with memories of political action -- 
"everybody I knew was in the movement" -- and then expanded the scope of the 
word movement until it fused with the choreography in a statement of artistic 
liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Steve Moshier's score sometimes obliterated the text, but the 
dancing stayed eloquent nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Three writers and three composers created the text and music used in "Stained 
Glass," an overambitious dance-theater spectacle by local emerging artist 
Samuel Donlavy. Dealing with institutional and societal homophobia and AIDS, it 
began promisingly as bold protest drama but quickly grew into a woozy ensemble 
vehicle in which the melodramatic pantomime suffering of two men contrasted 
with the menacing unison paroxysms of a women's corps. Eventually, their 
twitching infected everyone; the piece ended with Donlavy alone onstage, 
pleading for sympathy between spasms. Obviously a sincere effort, but just as 
obviously over the top and not yet ready for a premiere in a major venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the program: Winifred R. Harris' "When Wet Came to Paper," a work 
praised more than once in these pages.

THEATER REVIEW; WEST COAST ENSEMBLE'S 'EDDIE': SOME FLAVOR BUT LACKS THE BEEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Lipman's "Eddie Quinn," at the West Coast Ensemble, is a jaunty little 
urban tale, unpretentious to the point of being superficial. Still, it's good 
for a spritz of New York flavor, for a few laughs and for some cheerfully 
entertaining performances under the direction of Claudia Jaffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The title character is having a bad day. Emotionally and financially drained 
by the funeral for his adoptive father and former truck-driving colleague, he's 
seeking solace at his neighborhood hangout when a Mafia enforcer shows up to 
demand $7,000 that Eddie ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
 A barfly suggests that now's the time for Eddie to seek out his biological 
parents. He finds them in a Park Avenue apartment, where he tries to charm -- 
then bully -- his way into their bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 As Eddie, Frankie Como is an exemplar of fast-talking, untutored New York 
smarts. When he joins his pals (Jerry Kernion, Lou Wagner) at the bar, they 
make up a motley but picturesque collection of different physical types, 
towered over by the enforcer (Clint Carmichael), whose heart becomes much too 
golden and gooey by play's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation with the Park Avenue couple (Joyce Meadows, Michael Clair 
Miller) is tense and funny, but it also seems condensed, as if Lipman were 
trying to squeeze it into a TV time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Eddie Quinn," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd. Mondays-Wednesdays, 
8 p.m. Ends Nov. 23. $10. (213) 871-1052.

 Gone With the Ratings: "Scarlett," the four-part sequel to "Gone With the 
Wind," scored a decisive ratings victory in its initial outing Sunday night, 
CBS reported Monday. In the 32 major markets for which overnight figures were 
available, the continuing saga of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler attracted 
31% of the available viewers, compared to 22% for ABC's telecast of "Lethal 
Weapon 3" and 13% for NBC's showing of "JFK." The national ratings will be 
released today.

 Singer-songwriter Billy Joel opened the Australian leg of his River of Dreams 
tour Sunday by announcing that this would be his last world tour. "It doesn't 
mean it's the last time I'm going to do a concert, it's just the last time I'm 
going to do these long marathon tours," Joel, 45, said in Melbourne. He said he 
would spend more time writing and composing than performing because he was 
"getting a little bit burnt out with this Billy Joel guy." . . . Bob Hope went 
on the road to Wayne, Pa., to present retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf with 
the Bob Hope Five-Star Award, which recognizes the qualities of honor and 
courage symbolic of George Washington and his soldiers at Valley Forge. About 
3,000 people attended the ceremony at Valley Forge Military Academy and 
College, where Schwarzkopf graduated in 1952. . . . Radio personality and peace 
activist Casey Kasem will be honored tonight at a Time for Peace Festival at 
the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Shari Belafonte emcees. Proceeds go to Variety 
Club, an international children's organization, and the Time for Peace Project, 
a mobile architectural pavilion designed to promote peace and aid children. ART

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DIFRANCO A STRIKINGLY ORIGINAL NEW VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you haven't heard of Ani DiFranco yet, you probably will soon, but not 
through the standard music business hype. The New York-based neo-folkie 
outright rejects the music industry's ways.At just 23, she's already released 
six albums through her own Righteous Babe Records, and on Sunday at LunaPark 
she performed a new song that equates record executives with Satan. 
</P>
<P>
 Her small following, though, is so intensely evangelical that you're bound to 
be cornered by a fan someday at a party who will zealously extol the pixieish 
singer-songwriter's virtues. Believe that hype. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of an enthusiastic bunch of those fans Sunday, she came off as a 
strikingly original new voice. Pointed but not confrontational, personally 
detailed but not confessional, women-oriented by not us-against-them, her songs 
walk a long bridge between Joni Mitchell and Pearl Jam. Her inventive guitar 
playing and strong singing likewise flow between delicate and percussively 
propulsive, with sharp rhythms accented by her accompanist, drummer Andy 
Stochansky. 
</P>
<P>
 While her look -- silver nose-ring, blue bandanna over a buzz cut -- makes her 
a central-casting archetype of grunge-folk, her wit and range and giggly asides 
confounded any easy tag you could have thrown her way. No wonder she wants to 
stay clear of the major labels -- they wouldn't know what to do with her. But 
her fans do: Sing her praises, loudly. STEVE HOCHMAN

TV REVIEWS; 'KILLER QUAKE!' FOCUSES ON THREAT BENEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the metaphors used by seismologists interviewed in tonight's "Nova" 
report, "Killer Quake!," is the "shattered glass" pattern of recently 
discovered blind-thrust faults lacing the Los Angeles Basin. The shattering of 
scientific illusions is what "Killer Quake!" is really all about. 
</P>
<P>
 What seismologists know is bound to change, because Southern Californians are 
living through a time of historic geologic significance -- from few earthquakes 
during most of the century to clusters of them as we reach the millennium. But 
what scientists are sure of is that the Big One has been something of a 
distraction, that attention must shift from the San Andreas Fault to those 
lurking miles directly below our feet. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have been keeping up, "Killer Quake!" doesn't update the 
post-Northridge quake news very much. What is revelatory here, though, is the 
threat posed by the Elysian Fault, a blind-thrust fault coursing straight 
through Downtown L.A. That it was discovered by oil geologists mapping the area 
for hidden oil pockets is indicative of the hit-and-miss, unpredictable game of 
quake sleuthing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that they know of Elysian, seismologists such as James Dolan and Ross 
Stein (who theorizes on the way stress released by one fault shifts over to 
another) are trying to find a historic pattern for quakes in the area. What 
they foresee isn't good news: A 7-plus-magnitude quake could happen at any 
time, and Downtown's steel-reinforced buildings are probably not ready for the 
shake. 
</P>

 * "Killer Quake!" airs at 8 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 
15, and at 7 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

TV REVIEWS; 'HILLARY'S CLASS' AND BOOMERS' LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can a generation of women be understood through the experiences of a single 
graduating class? Tonight's "Frontline" broadcast, "Hillary's Class," comes 
dangerously close to suggesting that it can. And it offers yet more proof that 
boomers are the most over-examined yet least-understood generation of all.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, producer Rachel Dretzin assembles some telling, affecting 
individual portraits of the Wellesley College Class of 1969, whose president 
was the then-Hillary Rodham . 
</P>
<P>
 None, of course, followed Hillary's remarkable path, though classmate Betsy 
Griffith points out that she did not have it all, that rather, she made her 
ambitions secondary to those of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 These women, all children of wealth and privilege, received one message in 
school, another in the workplace. The Wellesley motto of "Serve Rather Than Be 
Served," along with budding feminism's promise of expanding opportunities for 
women, produced a stream of hope that real life was bound to slow down or dam 
up completely. 
</P>
<P>
 At one extreme there is CBS correspondent Martha Teichner, who became so 
enmeshed in her work, which forced her to relocate at the network's whim, that 
she couldn't put down roots, marry and have children. The way Teichner conveys 
the shock of her fate is testimony to one kind of cost paid by the 
fast-tracker. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman, on the other hand, found her career stifled by having children. 
She was born late enough to be admitted to the corporate boardroom, but not 
late enough to enjoy the kind of flextime work policies that later became more 
common. The irony of her story and that of ex-reporter Ann Sherwood Sentilles 
is that they ended up being homemakers despite their ambitious dreams.  
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as two of the class's few black women, went on to live what they 
describe as happy lives. Still others struggled for years to find themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The very differences among these personal stories warn us to avoid jumping to 
conclusions about Hillary's generation. As members of a historical generation 
of women, they have changed, and will probably change again. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hillary's Class" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15.

<P>
 A strong earthquake rocked the Philippine island of Mindoro early today, 
killing at least three people and destroying some homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 and was centered in a strait six 
miles north of Calapan, a town on the northern end of the island, said the 
Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology. 
</P>
<P>
 It was felt throughout the central and south Philippines, including Manila.

 U.S. Catholic bishops expressed surprise and dismay at likely Republican House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich's call for cuts in welfare payments and for private 
charities and orphanages to pick up the slack.Auxiliary Bishop John H. Ricard 
of Baltimore and others said private charities do not have the resources to 
step in if the federal government approved the sorts of cutbacks that Gingrich 
and other Republicans are proposing. Such policies, they add, would attack poor 
families rather than the sources of poverty. The reaction came at the 
semiannual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is 
also addressing such issues as the role of women in the clergy and sexual abuse 
by priests.

NATION IN BRIEF; LOUISIANA; PLAN OKD TO END DESEGREGATION SUIT 
</P>

From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge in New Orleans approved a plan to end a 20-year desegregation 
battle by encouraging enrollment by blacks and whites alike at all Louisiana 
universities while preserving two historically black schools.The proposal is 
aimed at resolving a 1974 suit in which the Justice Department accused 
Louisiana of running a dual higher education system -- one for blacks and one 
for whites. U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz said a three-member committee 
will monitor the settlement. The historically black Southern University system 
and Grambling State University will remain intact. When the lawsuit was filed, 
Southern and Grambling were 99% black, and the others were 89% to 97% white.

 The trial of a teen-ager for the murder of a British tourist at a north 
Florida highway rest stop began with prosecutors saying they would not seek the 
death penalty.Instead, the state will seek a life prison term for John 
Crumitie, 17, the first of two youths to go on trial for the slaying of Gary 
Colley, a Yorkshire truck driver whose murder drew worldwide attention to 
Florida's high crime rate. Colley, 34, was gunned down in September, 1993, 
during a botched robbery attempt 30 miles east of the state capital. The 
attack, which occurred as Colley and his girlfriend slept in their car, made 
Colley the 12th foreign tourist slain in Florida in as many months.

SCOTT HARRIS: PERSONAL AND POLITICAL MEMORY LANES; MANY ANGRY WHITE MALES, NO 
DOUBT, SAW PROPOSITION 187 AS A VOTE AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gail U., who broke my heart in the eighth grade, looked good as a blonde. 
Holly M., who flirted and teased lo those many years ago, still remembered how 
to play that game. And Brigid C., the former Homecoming princess, was by male 
consensus the belle of this ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Z., a fellow Cub Scout and a classmate from K-12, was the very picture of 
the fit, clean-cut firefighter. Lanny P., with whom I once dissected a fetal 
pig, had a receding hairline but the confidence to scam on Brigid. And Mike L., 
who sometimes showed up for class stoned, wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 It was worth the $67.50. It was nice to see everybody. And for this member of 
Santa Ana High School's Class of 1974, it was especially sweet to see Sherri 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Our love story began the summer before our senior year. We met weekly to watch 
"Kung Fu" in her family's TV room, and friendship blossomed into love. Ah yes, 
Grass-hoppah. For the next five years, it was your basic roller coaster of 
young romance, a saga of passion and jealousy, joy and heartache. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen years had passed since our last encounter. We hugged and she 
introduced me to her husband, Mike -- a different Mike. They live in Westlake 
Village. My Sherri was a girl who insisted she'd never have kids. Mike's 
"Sharon" is a full-time housewife and mother of two boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike's in software. And he is, as he puts, "an angry white male." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He says it with a smile. The reunion, we all knew, was for memories and 
catching up, so this conversation didn't take place until the morning after. 
Sherri's 9 a.m. call to my hotel room suggesting breakfast was a surprise. We 
met at a Cuban restaurant in the historic downtown of Orange, three grown-ups 
coming out of a time warp, trying to reconcile the past, present and future. 
</P>
<P>
 When the conversation veered toward the election, Mike grinned and Sherri 
grimaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Mike is angry. He's angry about What's Happening to America. He didn't 
vote for Proposition 187 and Wilson and Huffington because he's a 
dyed-in-the-wool conservative. He made a point of letting me know that he voted 
for Mondale against Reagan, and even displayed a Dukakis sign in '88, back when 
they still lived in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it didn't seem polite to take notes, so you'll have to trust my memory 
here. If I get anything wrong, I'm sure Mike will let me know. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike favored Proposition 187 for all the usual reasons and more. For him, this 
measure wasn't just an approach to illegal immigration. This measure, for Mike, 
was about Spanish-language radio stations and ballots printed in something 
other than English. It was a way to say "Enough already!" to the trashing of 
Christopher Columbus and proposed changes in U.S. history textbook and 
"multiculturalism." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in short, a repudiation to just about everything that falls under the 
broad heading of "political correctness" and a vote in favor of "personal 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The more Mike talked, the more it became obvious that Proposition 187 was like 
a runaway 18-wheeler carrying a cargo of volatile grievances, all touching on 
the competing ideals of America. Many angry white males, no doubt, saw 
Proposition 187 as a vote against affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
 America and its ideals is a favorite subject. Some of what Mike said reminded 
me of a George Will column about the threat that "multiculturalism" poses to 
society, listing an array of sins committed in dubious celebration of America's 
diversity. There are valid points to be made. But has America ever been 
monocultural, like, say Japan? Is that a worthy ideal? 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, the Orange County Register carried a feature story that 
morning describing how Santa Ana High's current enrollment includes only 40 
white students. In my day, whites were a plurality, but not a majority. 
America's story has always been one of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was easy to understand Mike's objections to efforts to literally 
revise U.S. history textbooks. Soon we found ourselves debating the relative 
merits of such heroic figures as Paul Revere and Harriet Tubman. As kids, we 
learned all about the legend of Paul Revere, largely because Longfellow was a 
hell of a publicist. But why was it that Mike and I didn't hear about Harriet 
Tubman until our college years or later? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it wrong for kids to learn a little bit about Tubman, and little less about 
Revere? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike is still holding on to hope that Huffington pulls it out. He voted 
absentee, and likes to think that his will be the last one counted, and it will 
hand defeat to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that he thinks Huffington is a good candidate. Not at all. And it's 
not that Mike loathes Feinstein for her stand against assault rifles. No, he 
made it clear that the first and foremost reason he voted for Huffington was to 
punish Feinstein for her stand against 187, to send that message loud and 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was right. She predicted that 187 might cost her the election. Men 
like Mike, and women too, were willing to overlook Huffington's hypocrisy and 
other flaws to express their anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike's wife didn't really want to talk about it. But it was good to hear that 
she didn't vote for Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. senator, my Sherri didn't vote for anybody. 
</P>
<P>

GETTING INVOLVED: HELPING HIV PATIENTS WITH BASIC NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes, people ask Kathy Schack, volunteer coordinator for the Catalyst 
Foundation For AIDS Awareness and Care, how she can continue to do the work she 
does, after seeing so many people die whom she has helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as helping them live while they are here, trying to make sure 
their basic needs are met," said Schack, who started in May, 1993, as a 
volunteer with the group that serves people with AIDS in the Antelope Valley. 
The day after the Northridge earthquake, Schack was hired as one of the group's 
paid employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Schack does most of her work at the agency's office on Elm Avenue in 
Lancaster, but she also establishes an ongoing relationship with the clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have dealt with so much negative," Schack said. "They have been 
discriminated against and shunned not only by society, but sometimes by their 
own family members. Here, I accept them and they accept me." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in politically conservative Lancaster do not even realize that AIDS is 
around them, Schack said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, people will actually say, 'You mean we have AIDS in the Antelope 
Valley?' " she said. "We kind of get a kick out of it sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the foundation's clients are gay men, Schack said, the 
fastest growing percentage of AIDS patients the agency serves are women and 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, the Catalyst Foundation will hold a volunteer training 
program from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Young People's Institute for the Arts, at 
the corner of Date Avenue and Lancaster Boulevard in Lancaster. Often people 
who may not want to be volunteers, but just want to learn about the disease, 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
 The training prepares volunteers to work with the foundation's buddy program 
in which they are matched up with a person who has AIDS to visit and help as 
needed. The training explains for volunteers what happens physically to AIDS 
patients as well as "the emotional roller coaster ride," Schack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was established last year by Lancaster physician Susan 
Lawrence, when her husband was dying of AIDS. A unique part of the training 
session includes a panel discussion Sunday afternoon by people with acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome or HIV, who, Schack said, will "give a human face to 
the disease." 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in volunteering or signing up for the training session can 
call Schack at (805) 948-8559. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Family Housing Corp, a nonprofit homeless organization is looking for 
volunteers to participate in the "Adopt-A-Family for the Holidays" project for 
more than 100 homeless or very low-income families living at the Valley Shelter 
in North Hollywood, other facilities or in temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers would adopt a family and provide holiday gifts to the children 
and/or holiday food baskets to help the family prepare a holiday meal. For more 
information or to volunteer, call Allison Lee at (818) 982-4091. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army in Burbank is beginning its Angel Tree adoption program 
outside Mervyn's department store at the Media City Center mall on Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers choose a paper angel ornament from the tree listing a name, age and a 
present being wished for. The gift purchased is returned to either the Angel 
Tree or the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Adult School needs volunteers to answer phones and do filing and light 
typing one day a week or more from 9 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information call the Burbank Retired Seniors Volunteer Program at 
(818) 953-9503. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Storefront run by Jewish Family Services in North Hollywood needs a 
volunteer to plan and coordinate day trips for active seniors. For more 
information call Judy Raffel at (818) 984-1380. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000 
Prairie St., Chatsworth, 91311. Or fax them to (818) 772-3338.

 Kmart Profit Plunges Almost 60%: Prompting renewed calls for the retailer to 
hire an outsider to help pump life into its sagging stores, Kmart Corp. said it 
earned $39 million, or 8 cents a share, compared to $94 million, or 20 cents a 
share, last year.The report was much weaker that Wall Street had expected. The 
retailer had warned shareholders earlier that earnings would be lower. It said 
then that unusually warm weather in late September and early October was 
hurting sales and profit on fall clothing. Troy, Mich.-based Kmart's 4,000 
retail outlets include Kmart, Builders Square, Borders, Waldenbooks and Sports 
Authority.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; YIELDS TUMBLE AS STOCKS GAIN; DOW UP 28.26

 Treasury bond yields plummeted Monday, pushed by a stronger dollar and 
technical factors a day before a Federal Reserve Board meeting that is expected 
to produce the year's sixth increase in short-term rates. Stocks rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether 30-year bond yield fell to 8.07% from 8.15% on Thursday. Its 
price, which rises when rates fall, was up 13/16 point, or $8.13 per $1,000 
face value. The government securities market was closed Friday, Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.26 points to 
3,829.73. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 11 to 9 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's Open Market Committee was widely expected to raise short-term 
interest rates at least half a percentage point today in its continuing effort 
to cool the economy and stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors bought bonds Monday, hoping the Fed's action would support higher 
prices. Bond investors like any strong move against inflation, since rising 
prices erode the value of securities, such as bonds, that pay a fixed interest 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's gain was spurred by foreign buyers anticipating stronger stocks 
and bonds, stemming from renewed confidence in the Fed's desire to curb 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of heavy overseas dollar buying by big investment funds and selling of 
German marks for Swedish kronor after Sweden voted Sunday to join the European 
Union also helped the U.S. currency, market participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was also aided by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's comment that 
he was pleased with the recent U.S. intervention to boost the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar finished at 1.544 German marks, up from 1.530 on 
Friday and the highest level since Oct. 14. The dollar was changing hands at 
the rate of 98.31 Japanese yen, up from 97.68. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican currency fell . The dollar was quoted in New York at 3.451 pesos, 
compared to 3.443 pesos Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks moved up sharply as lower rates and the dollar's strength helped 
investors put aside worries about inflation. Big Board volume was 260.61 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market indexes also moved higher. The NYSE's composite index rose 1.59 
points to 254.84. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.69 points to 466.04. 
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 6.02 points to 768.14; on the American Stock 
Exchange, the market value index edged up 0.68 point to 448.72. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Powersoft rose 7 7/8 to 69 1/4. The company and Sybase said they would 
merge. Powersoft shareholders will receive 1.6 Sybase shares for each Powersoft 
issue. Powersoft will operate as an independent subsidiary of Sybase. Sybase 
fell 2 1/16 to 46 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
 Other software stocks posted gains. Among them were Gupta, up 1 and 13/16 to 
12, and Microsoft, which launched Internet Assistant and rose 2 1/4 to 64 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiron rose 2 3/4 to 74 1/4. The company is reportedly negotiating to sell a 
49% stake to Swiss drug and chemical maker Ciba-Geigy for nearly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastman Kodak rose 1 7/8 to 47 5/8. Prudential Securities upgraded the stock 
to "buy" from "hold." 
</P>
<P>
 * Citicorp rose 5/8 to 45 7/8. Merrill Lynch upgraded its near-term rating of 
the shares to "above average" from "neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad. Mexico's Bolsa fell 40.35 points to 2,486.64 . 
London's Financial Times 100-share average rose 19.4 points to 3,095.3; in 
Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average closed at 2,089.29, up 10.94 points. 
Tokyo's Nikkei average fell 22.91 points to 19,261.45.

 Toys R Us Income Up 26%: The world's largest toy store retailer also said its 
third-quarter sales rose 13%, due largely to continued expansion.Toys R Us Inc. 
said it earned $47.4 million, or 17 cents a share, in the three months ended 
Oct. 29, compared to a profit of $37.5 million, or 13 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. Sales rose to $1.63 billion from $1.45 billion. The 
third-quarter increase can also be attributed to strong sales of basic toy 
merchandise and the success of the October Pre-Holiday Bonus Book, Chief 
Executive Michael Goldstein said.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A CHILD'S VISION OF LIFE DURING WARTIME; WHEN THE RAINBOW 
GODDESS WEPT BY CECILIA MANGUERRA BRAINARD ; DUTTON; $19.95, 216 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stories of war are perhaps most compelling when told through the eyes of 
children, whose innocence is always so tragically incongruous to the adult 
madness that rages around them. "When the Rainbow Goddess Wept," a first novel 
by Cecilia Manguerra Brainard that chronicles the Japanese invasion of the 
Philippines during World War II, is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Told by nine-year-old Filipina Yvonne Macaraig, the narrative is rendered in a 
touchingly plain style that manages to be both wondrously childlike and 
chilling in its realism. 
</P>
<P>
 Brainard slips almost effortlessly from Yvonne's fairy-tale musings to 
unsentimental descriptions of people who have lost limbs, eyes and fingernails, 
of bloated corpses that she and her friends discover bobbing in a river, of 
children who have been bayoneted to death in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferating horrors constantly threaten to overtake Yvonne's spirit, but 
time and again her quiet, resilient optimism finds full expression in the 
native epic tales passed on to her by the household cook Laydan, and in her 
family's unfaltering love. 
</P>
<P>
 The book opens in 1941 on the island of Ubec in the Philippines, to idyllic 
scenes of Yvonne cavorting with her cousin Esperanza and sharing intimate 
moments with her father, mother, grandfather and aunt. They all live in a 
sprawling house in a peaceful village.  
</P>
<P>
 But as the Japanese encroach and American forces fail to save the day, things 
quickly change. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne's family decides to flee Ubec to the countryside, which is controlled 
by Filipino guerrillas and is nominally safer. Her kind-hearted engineer 
father, a staunch American supporter, wants to enlist his skills in the 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The next three years test not only Yvonne but everyone else around her who 
lose heart: her worrisome mother, who gives birth to a stillborn during the 
exodus from Ubec; Nida, the sexy, blustery bar owner who accompanies Yvonne's 
family and at one point offers her body to a Japanese soldier in order to save 
them all; and Doc Menez, whose seemingly limitless capacity to give is nearly 
twisted into madness after finding his family murdered in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphic though all of this sounds, Brainard's book is also quick to depict the 
good things just as vividly; even in the midst of war, she says, life is all of 
a singular, complex piece that demands embracing. So Yvonne still delights at 
the lushness of plants, the sound of birds and crickets, the marvelous tales of 
gods and maidens in the ancient "skyworld" that Laydan spins. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Brainard ever lose a sense of droll humor, keenly observant as she is 
of the many people around her who are bigger characters than those that people 
Laydan's epics. In one chapter, long-grieving Doc Menez decides to re-enact the 
crucifixion on Good Friday to do penance for the death of his family. After 
shouldering a heavy wooden cross and collapsing at his destination, he stops 
breathing and his audience sadly declares him dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But as several townswomen attend to his prone body, Yvonne relates an 
extraordinary turn of events: "I looked at Doc's naked body and saw that he was 
developing an enormous erection. As they (the women) stared at Doc's organ that 
had miraculously stirred to life, the women continued screaming, but they 
recovered and quickly threw a sheet over him before the men arrived. Doc heaved 
a big sigh, then he sat up calmly and said, 'I'm so hungry. Could I have some 
bitter melon and rice?' Doc was alive! Suddenly the air turned light and clean. 
. . . My soul within me expanded." 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Rainbow Goddess Wept" is full of moments like these. Despite the 
enormous political presence of the war, it is human and family history that 
Brainard really illuminates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is telling that the day the war ends, Yvonne menstruates for the first time 
and studies her changed body in a mirror. It is then, too, that she understands 
what Laydan meant when she advised her to "become the epic": it is being 
written on hearts and minds every day.

THE WEEK AHEAD: HANOI; A NEIGHBORHOOD VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a few months ago, Vietnam and China were exchanging bellicose threats 
based on their respective claims to the isolated Spratly Islands in the South 
China Sea.But on Saturday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin is scheduled to arrive 
in Hanoi for a "good neighbor" round of meetings with senior Vietnamese 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit by Jiang symbolizes the ambiguity of Sino-Vietnamese relations. 
Regarding the Spratlys, the desolate archipelago that sits above what 
geologists claim may be a vast reserve of oil, the two enemies talk tough. 
Diplomatically, however, the Chinese and Vietnamese have made steady progress 
since normalizing relations in 1991.

THE WEEK AHEAD: LUSAKA; A CHANCE FOR PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 19 years of war, and nearly a year of tortuous negotiations, leaders of 
Angola's government and rebel forces are tentatively scheduled to sign a 
U.N.-brokered peace treaty Sunday in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia.If all goes 
as planned, a cease-fire will take effect two days later, ending Africa's 
longest civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for power-sharing between the government of President Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos and the rebel UNITA movement led by Jonas Savimbi. The two 
armies helped dislodge Portuguese colonialists in 1975 and then turned on each 
other in what became first a Cold War proxy fight, then a brutal power 
struggle.

POSTSCRIPT; CHURCH REBUILDING IS POTENT SYMBOL OF EASTERN GERMANS' REVIVAL OF 
HOPE; COMPUTERS AND ARTISANS WORK ON BAROQUE FRAUENKIRCHE, DESTROYED BY ALLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly half a century, ever since British and American bombers reduced 
this fairy-tale Saxon capital to a wasteland of rubble and ash, all that 
remained standing of the great Church of Our Lady were two ruined walls facing 
each other like a pair of bookends over a heap of broken rock. 
</P>
<P>
 All the delicate ceiling paintings, the ornate baroque altar, the three-story 
organ that Johann Sebastian Bach once played -- all of this was lost forever in 
firestorms that burned for a full week and took an estimated 35,000 lives. Of 
what little was left of the church structure, the East German government made a 
striking memorial to the horrors of war and, it should be added, the 
mercilessness of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the East German regime is gone, and eastern Germany is slowly 
rebuilding, politically, economically and spiritually. And today in Germany the 
Protestant Frauenkirche, as the Church of Our Lady is known, is being 
transformed from a somber reminder of humanity's capacity for destruction into 
a potent symbol of eastern Germany's re-entry into the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lost splendors of Dresden -- a city once so exquisite that it was 
called "Florence on the Elbe" -- will never be recovered. But at least, by the 
year 2006 -- if all goes as planned, and the money doesn't run out -- the 
Frauenkirche's 312-foot-tall, lanterned dome will once again dominate this 
city's riverside skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration of the Frauenkirche is by far the biggest historic 
preservation project since German unification, combining as it does 
centuries-old building techniques with computer-age technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the use of as many of the original stones, timbers and iron 
braces as possible, and for the rebuilding of some interior furnishings, 
including the organ. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconstruction is expected to take 12 years -- just two years less than it 
took the architect and city planner George Baehr to build the Frauenkirche the 
first time around, in the 18th Century. At that time, the church could 
accommodate nearly 4,000. Its acoustics attracted such composers as Richard 
Wagner and Gustav Mahler to premier their choral and symphonic works inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baehr worked with the most modern methods of his time, and we're using the 
most modern methods of ours," Frauenkirche restoration architect Christoph 
Frenzel said. "The computer is very important. We are rebuilding the 
Frauenkirche in the computer first." 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest months of the project have thus been devoted to solving the 
three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle of broken stones that have been lying in the 
heart of Dresden all these years, just across the street from a hideous, 
Communist-era cement-and-mirror-glass police station. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 60,000 stones and fragments, large and small, and the 
restoration experts were determined to figure out where each of them had 
belonged in the original structure. 
</P>
<P>
 And to a startling degree, they have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the original stones are now known to have been either damaged beyond 
repair or melted down in the 1,000-degree fires that engulfed Dresden in the 
air raids of February, 1945. But the crews have been able to identify about 
9,000 stones in good enough condition to reuse, and to pinpoint exactly where 
they should be placed when the new church goes up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started by asking ourselves, 'How might the church have collapsed?' " 
recalled Frenzel, the architect. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the Frauenkirche didn't fall at the height of the bombing but 
two days afterward in a chain reaction that started with the collapse of two of 
the eight main support pillars. The engineers determined that the church 
toppled to the south, which meant that the stones on the top of the heap were 
probably from the north side. 
</P>
<P>
 They then laid a rope grid over the rubble heap and began analyzing the 
wreckage, square by square, stone by stone. They were helped in their work by 
old blueprints and by a wealth of detailed, close-up photos of the Frauenkirche 
that were taken in the 1920s, when the church was extensively repaired and 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 As the work has gone forward, technicians have been registering the physical 
characteristics of each reusable stone in a computer databank. 
</P>
<P>
 New stones will be created at the same sandstone quarries along the Elbe River 
that Baehr selected for the original stones. To hold down costs, apprentice 
stonemasons will be making one stone apiece as part of their licensing 
requirements.  
</P>
<P>
 However great the symbolic value of a renewed Frauenkirche, however, a 
historic preservation on this scale is not cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Original budgets called for the expenditure of about $70 million, but 
estimates now say the redone Frauenkirche will cost at least $175 million, and 
the German news magazine Der Spiegel has reported that it may reach more than 
$300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are asking why so much money is being lavished on just one building -- 
particularly on a church in a society where organized religious died out after 
the Second World War. Wouldn't it be better to sink all those marks into 
housing? 
</P>
<P>
 "This question is often asked," Frauenkirche site engineer Lothar Nickoleit 
conceded. "But," he added, citing various private donors and their diverse 
motivations, "if we weren't restoring the church, this money wouldn't 
automatically be available for housing." 
</P>
<P>
 Still other critics have suggested that Dresden's pile of rubble sent a much 
more important message in East German times -- "Here are the fruits of human 
aggression" -- than any baroque church, however beautifully restored, could 
convey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dresden's rubble held "great potential for theological and political 
missionary work," said Ulrich Boehme, Saxony's Lutheran Church assemblyman for 
buildings and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 But such critics, so far, have been drowned out by the clinking of chisels on 
stone and of donations going into the coffers of the Frauenkirche Foundation. 
Already, 21 million marks, or about $15 million, has been raised. "No 
rebuilding project . . . has ever in so short a time triggered such a flood of 
commitments," said the newspaper Die Welt. 
</P>
<P>
 At Christmas, 1993, Dresden citizens bought $180,000 worth of special 
fund-raising candles for the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people in Dresden are behind the archeological restoration of their 
landmark, even if it takes longer and costs more than originally planned," said 
a spokesman for the state of Saxony, of which Dresden is the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because eastern Germans, whose sector of the country was occupied 
and controlled by the Soviets at the end of the war, paid far more dearly for 
the sins of the Nazis than did their compatriots in West Germany, which was 
occupied by Britain, France and the Marshall Plan-dispensing Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 While West Germany started rebuilding after the war, and ultimately enjoyed 
its famous "Economic Miracle," East Germany spent years paying war reparations 
to the Soviet Union, watching its battle-scarred industrial infrastructure fall 
to pieces. During the Cold War, East Germans came to accept this fate as a kind 
of penance for their country's support of Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Cold War is over, however, a project like the Frauenkirche sends 
the tacit message that, perhaps, eastern Germans have paid penance enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1993, the first Christmas vespers in nearly half a century were 
held on the Frauenkirche site. About 50,000 people turned out even though there 
was nothing but the two broken walls to shelter them from the winter chill. 
That was 15,000 more than the official death toll for the 1945 bombing.

NATIONAL AGENDA; HAITI'S CAPITAL OF CHAOS; PORT-AU-PRINCE'S NEW MAYOR STAKES 
HIS FUTURE ON THE FORMIDABLE TASK OF REMAKING THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a typical morning snarl on Boulevard La Saline, the key artery that 
connects the Haitian capital's seaport to its desperate daily commerce. Average 
driving time: two blocks an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of pavement merchants sit cross-legged in the street, hawking stacks 
of mangoes, oranges, papayas, baseball caps, used clothes and polluted water by 
the glass, as battered trucks piled high with bags of sugar, flour and rice 
attempt to navigate around and through them, delivering goods to scores of 
illegally constructed warehouses -- legacies of the strong-arm corruption that 
pushed the hawkers into the street during the past three years under Haiti's 
crooked, indifferent military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars belch black smoke. Horns blare. Vehicles break down every few minutes. A 
wheel-less van inches through the mess, mounted on a wooden cart pulled by a 
single man. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is a metaphor for the municipal madness of Port-au-Prince and its 2 
million people, and for the staggering challenge confronting Mayor Evans Paul, 
who has staked his future, perhaps his life, on the task of transforming the 
urban nightmare into a daily life of, he says, "something more than anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul emerged from three years of hiding and occasional assassination attempts 
as the man considered most likely to succeed Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's 
next president. But to do so in elections scheduled for late next year, when 
Aristide, under law, has to step down, Paul must first resurrect the capital 
from the ashes of dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the soft-spoken man who prefers open shirts to dark suits and 
impassioned rhetoric to urban master plans must deliver, and fast, in a nation 
of limitless expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul must deliver jobs to a capital with 80% unemployment. He must create 
security in a traumatized city of slums where many of the dictatorship's 
murderous thugs remain at large. He must remove impoverished hawkers from the 
streets without the use of excessive force, bulldoze garbage dumps that have 
become homes to thousands of scavengers and reclaim parks where fountains have 
become bathtubs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 And he must do so in a city that is flat broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul's task is a microcosm of what lies ahead for Haiti as a whole, after 
20,000 U.S. troops eased its dictators into exile and brought Aristide and Paul 
back to power in the poorest nation in the hemisphere. With the bulk of the 
U.S. troops scheduled to pull out of Haiti before Dec. 1, to be replaced by a 
softer multilateral force, Paul and Aristide know they are fighting against 
time, working with virtually no resources and a limited reservoir of popular 
goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short term, our deadline is Christmas," Paul said in a recent 
interview in his office at City Hall, a building ringed by U.S. Army concertina 
wire, rooftop sharpshooters and machine-gun nests. "We are used to doing the 
impossible, but now we're going to try to do the impossible before it's too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight will begin in earnest Monday at a two-day political showdown -- he 
calls it a symposium -- that Paul has spent weeks arranging. The goal is to 
enlist Haiti's rich yet wary private business people as the mayor's new 
partners in the future Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to create a center for the promotion of Port-au-Prince," he said. 
"And we can't do that without the private sector. The city itself has nothing." 
City Hall, in fact, was looted down to the wiring and plumbing in the final 
days of the military regime -- to the tune of nearly $2 million, according to 
the mayor's preliminary reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely nothing here when I got here," Paul recalled. "There was 
a typewriter ribbon without a typewriter. There wasn't a stick of furniture. 
The phones were gone. There wasn't even a sheet of paper. It was an utter 
disaster. And there wasn't a single penny in the city's accounts." 
</P>
<P>
 So out of sheer necessity, Paul turned to his least likely potential allies -- 
the business people who tacitly or overtly supported the military regime that 
ousted Aristide's and Paul's populist governments three years ago and shot down 
their pro-democracy colleagues on the street, terrorizing the city's 
impoverished masses night after night until American troops descended on the 
Caribbean nation Sept. 19 under United Nations authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallen military regime and some of its supporting business people are, in 
part, directly responsible for the problems Paul is now asking the elite to 
help solve. To illustrate, the mayor cited Boulevard La Saline, where the 
generals permitted helter-skelter construction of the waterfront warehouses in 
exchange for hefty kickbacks. The construction, in turn, forced hawkers into 
the street. The combination of sidewalk sales and warehouse construction was 
instant chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all the result of an anarchic situation, the consequence of 
retrograde governments running this city and this country into the ground," 
Paul said. "For example, when anyone can put up a building wherever and however 
he likes, a poor merchant (also) feels he can set up where he likes. So now, 
the example must again come from the elite. And that's why, above all else, I'm 
trying to bring the elite into this. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is not to punish or antagonize the elite, but to (make them 
sensitive), educate them. . . . There will, of course, always be people who 
refuse to give in, but we have to give everyone some room to maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul is the first to point out that the problem goes far beyond his city. It 
is part of a national crisis that must be solved simultaneously with his 
assault on the nightmares of Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300,000 of the city's slum dwellers are relative newcomers, refugees 
from rural Haiti who fled a nationwide crackdown during the 1991 coup. The 
influx swelled the city's already overpopulated slums. On the national level, 
Aristide, with the aid of U.S. Special Forces units, must now pacify the 
countryside, neutralizing and disarming the ousted regime's rural sheriffs, 
known as section chiefs in the military's cold jargon, and stage elections for 
about 2,000 local offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The national government also must establish economic policies that will 
encourage the private sector to invest, particularly in the urban development 
and worker-relocation projects that Paul plans to present in his meeting next 
week. Aristide clearly is aware of the needs. Among his new Cabinet ministers 
are internationally acclaimed professionals like World Bank economist Leslie 
Delatour, who has agreed to serve as Haiti's Central Bank chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Such appointments are critical gestures not only for the handful of families 
that control Haiti's private-sector economy but also for the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, which controls the largest single chunk of a 
worldwide aid effort for Haiti, now pledged at $500 million during the next 
five years. The AID budget of $200 million for the coming year alone equals 
about a quarter of the country's entire annual budget. And so powerful is the 
job of AID's country director, Larry Crandall, that diplomats have nicknamed 
him "commanding general" of the U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall agreed in a recent interview that developing Port-au-Prince is a 
critical cornerstone to changing the face of the Haitian nation, pointing out 
that "one-third of all Haitians live there." But most of the U.S. aid effort, 
he said, will be directed at nationwide humanitarian projects -- 2,500 feeding 
centers, family planning programs in a country that will double its population 
in just 20 years and an emergency short-term jobs program to employ up to 
50,000 people as garbage collectors and road crews. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest, Crandall concedes, will be up to the creativity and ingenuity of key 
leaders such as Evans Paul, a child of repression in Haiti. His father 
disappeared under the regime of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier in 1958; his 
mother, a textile worker, scratched out the funds to send the boy to high 
school and, later, to study drama and accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 His political bent began with a job as a disc jockey on Creole radio. Later he 
hosted a talk show called "Pen in Hand" and operated in the anti-government 
underground as Comrade Pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul is nothing if not inventive. He conceded he shuns pie-in-the-sky master 
plans and makes up his budgets after he solicits the money on a project. 
</P>
<P>
 He illustrated his stubborn approach by relating the events of a recent 
meeting: "The businessmen kept saying: 'Mr. Mayor, where are your studies? You 
must have plans and blueprints.' But I just kept repeating the same question 25 
times: 'What can you do for me and for this city?' Finally, they agreed to 
create a committee to finance these studies and plans for the symposium." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of any of those plans will be what Paul sees as crucial in 
resolving the needs of his city: creating an alternative. It goes together with 
what he described as his governing style: "You must be subtle and firm at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Paul selected an urban site to illustrate. Dubbed "U.N. Plaza" for the 
dozen or so flags of the Americas that fly beside a fountain in the center, the 
downtown park has become a blight that the homeless have converted into a huge 
outdoor toilet and laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 "To come with a stick and say 'You have to leave' is not the solution," he 
said. "Because these people are victims of our society. I don't think they've 
chosen to live in these conditions. What I'm trying to do is build a sanitary 
facility near this area, with showers, indoor toilets and laundry facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once there is an alternative, then I will ban the people from doing this in 
the square. Then if I have to use force, I will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 If he is successful in raising enough private capital at next week's symposium 
to build a new market complex for the city's tens of thousands of street 
hawkers, Paul said he will use the same approach to clear the streets and 
continue the process of urban development. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, he added, he also will need the continuing presence of the 
9,000 or so U.S. combat troops President Clinton has said will remain in Haiti 
after the Dec. 1 withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just lost three years to insecurity," Paul said. "We must be realistic. 
If the Americans weren't here, I wouldn't be able to be here or work at all." 
And, of the U.N. military force that is to inherit responsibility for 
maintaining security when the U.S. military pulls out the remainder of its 
troops next spring, Paul said, "It may well be that the U.N. force will not be 
able to create this atmosphere of security that we need. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing right now is that we must seize on the presence of the 
Americans to create our own political and economic stability through these new 
institutions. We must create a state of mind of security. Force cannot create 
stability forever, for violence is the father only of more violence." Back of 
the Pack 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti is desperately poor compared to other economies in the region, which 
poses a major challenge to Mayor Evans Paul's attempt to rehabilitate 
Port-au-Prince.

THE WEEK AHEAD: KATMANDU; A ROYAL KEY TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, a pro-democracy revolt ended Nepal's absolute monarchy and 
made King Birendra constitutional figurehead. Today Nepalese voters go to the 
polls with more than a few nostalgic thoughts of the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing Nepali Congress government of Prime Minister Girija Prasad 
Koirala is badly riven and seen as corrupt or too pro-Indian by many Nepalese. 
Inflation is rampant in the remote, landlocked country, one of the world's 
poorest. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition Communists are expected to make gains in the contest to control the 
205-seat Parliament and name a new premier. But it may be the monarchists who 
hold the balance of power and could swing the decision when the time comes to 
form a new democratically elected government.

DOING BUSINESS; AMERICAN STRIKES A CHORD; A U.S. IMMIGRANT IN ITALY HAS JOINED 
THE ELITE FRATERNITY OF THE WORLD'S TOP VIOLIN MAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not to string you along, but if seeking a singular single malt in Scotland, 
would you hunt for a distiller named Munoz? Homemade pate in France from a 
farmer called Kelly? 
</P>
<P>
 Pul-ease! 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting Antonio Stradivari's hometown in search of a fine violin, would you 
buy a Carlson? 
</P>
<P>
 Gotcha! 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat to his own surprise, Bruce Carlson, immigrant violin maker, is an 
American outpost in the Italian city that thinks of itself as the stringed 
instrument capital of Europe. Still, stranger things have happened here in 
Cremona, where civic pride has been measured in musical craftsmanship for four 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody told me at high school back in Michigan that I'd be living in Italy 
making violins, I'd have said they were crazy. Now, I guess I'm here to stay," 
Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's complaining. It is Carlson who maintains and restores priceless old 
instruments in the Cremona city museums, and it was Carlson who served as one 
of five judges at an international violin-making competition here this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the record show that in these high-tech times, not all Yankee 
entrepreneurs seeking their fortunes overseas are MBA fast-trackers. Carlson is 
emblematic of a relative handful of Americans come "home to Europe" with 
notebooks, pens, brushes, voices, the vision of poets, the hands of artists. 
And he is a dean among the elite few who commune with purflings and 
fingerboards, F-holes, sound posts and tailpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Carlson of Fenton, Mich., left a lot of good violin makers behind him in 
America, but he is the American maker people talk about in a place where the 
word violin simultaneously evokes an instrument and a city's soul. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 90 violin makers -- luthiers, as they call themselves -- 
living around Cremona here in the farm-rich Po Valley of northern Italy. 
Cremona, simply put, is the cradle of the violin. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1500s, when composers began writing for the violin, the Amati 
family was making Cremona instruments that still make news. The almost 
legendary Guarneri del Gesu was Cremonese, and so too -- full-chord press -- 
was Stradivari (1644-1737), who made about 1,200 instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 About 550 "Strads" are still being played more than 250 years after 
Stradivari's death. Indeed, most of them, like the one Carlson maintains for 
the city, have noble musical histories and their own names, and it is always 
exciting for Cremona when a new one is discovered: In 1987, a Stradivarius 
turned up in New York that had been stolen from violinist Bronislaw Huberman at 
Carnegie Hall 51 years before. In January, a violin brought for repair to 
luthiers in Petaluma, Calif., was identified as the 1732 Stradivarius "Duke of 
Alcantara," missing for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Carlson and other modern Cremona makers understand -- sometimes too well -- 
the luthier's craft has changed amazingly little since the Cremonese, who are 
history's greatest violin makers, developed and refined the sweet-singing 
instrument that is the heart of every symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The craft is, as ever, a labor of love. There is rote, since the dimensions 
cannot change much, but there is room for personal touches -- and for magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every now and then, one sounds better than the others, and you don't know 
why," Carlson mused. 
</P>
<P>
 The sides, back and neck of Cremona violins are sculpted from Bosnian maple, 
the supply of which is now interrupted by war. Fronts are spruce from the 
Dolomite Alps in northern Italy. The curves of the arching are critical and so 
are the thicknesses of the wood front and back, lest the sound be too weak or 
too woody and flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cremona is a calm town with lots of nice architecture and sculpture, but it's 
not too distracting -- a good place to concentrate on work," said Bernard 
Neumann, a violin maker from Montreal who studied with Carlson and is now his 
partner and member of a thriving expatriate colony here of luthiers from all 
over Europe and both halves of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 They make Cremona instruments whose purfling, those delicate strips of wood 
inlaid for technical and decorative reasons on the back and top, have always 
been fashioned from pear and white poplar. Their varnishes are centuries-tested 
witches' brews of propolis and sandarac, mastic and turmeric, balsam and copal, 
blended with a touch of serendipity and applied oh-so-gently with special 
brushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are reproducing what happened before, trying to get the quality and the 
aesthetics as good, " said Carlson. "We try to think like a 16th-Century violin 
maker, but with our faxes and PCs something is bound to get lost in 
translation." 
</P>
<P>
 Violin quality dropped after 1750, when the Austro-Hungarian Empire changed 
the rules governing guilds, although Cremona production continued. The comeback 
began in 1937, when a four-year state school for violin making was inaugurated 
under Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, 47, is a graduate of the school -- the long way around. During the 
Vietnam War, the Navy gave him an aptitude test and concluded he'd make a 
splendid meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching clouds on Guam, Carlson wandered into the base's hobby shop one day, 
found a book on violin making and tried to make one. It was an interest that 
stuck. "Back home after the service, a Swedish immigrant violin maker took me 
as an apprentice because of my Swedish last name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, without a word of Italian, he came to school in Cremona. After 
studies here, and three years of studying repair and restoration in Los Angeles 
with Hans Weisshaar, Carlson came back to Cremona. Yes, there was a girl, 
Bianca, an elementary school teacher, and there are two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Money would come, but it can arrive later than it might if you are 
surname-disadvantaged. "Musicians traveling to Italy to buy a violin want a 
name to go with it, but I wouldn't change mine," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did a lot of repairs, and with a steady stream of musicians passing 
through a shop he now shares with Neumann and Italian luthier Fausto 
Cacciatori, Carlson eventually began selling violins and cellos of his own 
making. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Carlson has a thriving shop that includes three apprentices -- a 
Frenchman and two German women -- and a reputation abuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce says the wood makes the instruments. They should look as beautiful as 
possible from the first coat. That's what we try to do," said Neumann. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what Cremona's American luthier says of the improbably named Italian 
cellos and violins that he crafts: "They promise to be good. In time they 
should get better. In 200 years, we'll know."

NEXT STEP; TAIWANESE WORRIED OVER HONG KONG; CHINA'S HEAVY-HANDED TREATMENT OF 
THE BRITISH COLONY IS SEEN AS A WARNING AGAINST DREAMS OF UNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAGGIE FARLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one is watching this territory's reversion to Chinese rule more closely 
than Taiwan -- the 1997 Hong Kong transition, after all, is supposed to be the 
model for Taiwan's own eventual return to the Chinese fold. And what Taipei's 
representatives here see gives them the jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from tempting Taiwan home by gentle handling of British-ruled Hong Kong, 
Beijing is growing increasingly heavy-handed as the July 1, 1997, transfer of 
power nears, disrupting the delicate balance of the triangle of Chinese 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the people of Rennie's Mill, an enclave of pro-Taiwan sentiment in 
Hong Kong's rural New Territories. Here, where the white starburst of the 
Taiwan flag flutters above the settlement's jumbled stone buildings, residents 
say they see no reason for confidence in rule by China. They are being forced 
out by redevelopment but also because Beijing does not want to inherit a camp 
full of Taiwanese supporters in 1997. Chinese officials have warned the 
residents to cool their ardent stance before the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no difference between being based in mainland China and Hong 
Kong after 1997," says Paul Lau, who was born in Rennie's Mill and grew up 
there. "Beijing promises 'one country, two systems,' but the two systems for us 
will be believe it or leave." 
</P>
<P>
 That Communist leitmotif, "one country, two systems," which pledges 50 years 
of autonomy for Hong Kong after the hand-over, sounds increasingly hollow to 
Taiwanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of China's economic interference alarm Taiwanese here the most. 
Beijing recently obstructed Hong Kong's renewal of commercial air service 
agreements between the territory and Taiwan, and in June, blocked an agreement 
that would allow Taiwanese investors into Hong Kong's futures market. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real signal that the party will soon be over in Hong Kong came this 
fall when China tried to stop a celebration of Taiwanese Founding Day organized 
by the Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party. Beijing immediately 
protested that Hong Kong was encouraging the creation of "two Chinas." The Hong 
Kong government refused to withdraw its permission, but celebrations throughout 
the colony had a wistful tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the last year we can do this," said a party-goer at a National 
Day banquet in the Hong Kong Hilton, as Taiwanese politicians and starlets 
linked arms and belted out nationalistic tunes. An event planned for the 100th 
anniversary of the founding of the Kuomintang itself in November was quietly 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not even 1997 yet," said Suzie Chiang, a top Taiwanese representative in 
Hong Kong. "It's a little bit early." 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong has acted as a neutral middle ground between the two Chinese 
governments since 1949, when the Communist Party won a bitter civil war and the 
Nationalist Party set up a rival administration in Taiwan. Although links 
between Taiwan and the mainland are still strained, billions of dollars in 
goods are transshipped through Hong Kong. The territory also is a transit point 
for traders and tourists. But when the British territory returns to Chinese 
sovereignty in 1997, Taiwanese organizations here fear that they will be on 
unwelcome ground.  
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Taiwanese organizations have operated discreetly but freely. 
Because Britain recognizes China, not Taiwan, Taiwanese organizations maintain 
a shadowy profile: the de facto Taiwanese embassy goes by the name Chung Hwa 
Travel Service; Taiwan's economic office here is known as Far East Trading Co. 
Suzie Chiang's government information office just changed its name from the 
provocative Free China Review to the Kwang Hwa Culture and Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's schizophrenic, it's crazy, but it's something we have to do," a Kwang 
Hwa staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like half of a bitterly divorced couple, China will not show up anywhere 
Taiwan is invited and constantly tests the loyalties of friends who try to 
maintain polite relations with both. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict makes international meetings, from economic summits to Asian 
sporting events, awkward. Although Taiwan is the world's 14th-largest trading 
nation and a full-fledged member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
group, it cannot send its president to APEC summits. Beijing recently argued 
against Taipei's bid to re-enter the United Nations, and threatened to pull out 
of October's Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, if Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui showed up. The Asian Olympic Committee rescinded its invitation to 
Lee, though a Taiwanese deputy premier went, and China stayed in the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's absolute nonsense," said Wu Chieh-ming of Taiwan's Far East 
Trade Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "They welcome our investment in mainland China," he said -- up to $15 billion 
worth, most of it funneled through Hong Kong. So Beijing should not disturb 
those who help get it there, Wu argued. "It's difficult to promote trade and 
investment if people are scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his Foreign Ministry (or Chung Hwa Travel Service) counterpart, Wu may 
be able to stay after 1997. Money is supposed to be OK, politics are not. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ni, head of the travel service and Taiwan's de facto ambassador here, 
said he has a long-term lease on his posh office space in central Hong Kong, 
where he issues visas that China does not recognize to a country that China 
will not admit exists. Beijing says that if he continues stamping passports, 
the travel agency-embassy must close. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't ask too much," said Ni, sinking into a black leather sofa, "just 
that we should be treated as an individual entity and given reasonable room for 
international activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's one card is economic power, but it's an ace. The political rifts are 
in some ways being quietly bridged by a steady flow of investment to the 
mainland. About 1.5 million Taiwanese visitors went to China through Hong Kong 
last year. According to a recent report by the World Bank, the combined total 
economic output of mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong is the world's 
second-largest -- behind the United States -- and represents a $3.2-trillion 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The clout of a fully united Greater China -- which would add Taiwanese 
investment and Hong Kong's services to China's already huge economy -- is one 
element driving Beijing's push for reunification. Since the Nationalists fled 
the mainland after losing the civil war in 1949, Beijing has been anxious to 
reclaim what it considers a renegade province and pretender to the throne. Hong 
Kong's 1997 reversion represents the first step toward bringing Taiwan back to 
the motherland. Taiwan, though wary, has not ruled out the possibility. But 
continued bickering could propel the potential triumvirate farther apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say the next century belongs to the Chinese," said Shaw Yu-ming, 
cultural director of the pro-China United Daily News Group in Taipei. "Whether 
the Chinese end up as a leader in the 21st Century, however, will depend in 
large part on the status of relations across the Taiwan Strait."

 Even with a common language and culture, Taiwanese companies admit that it is 
not so easy doing business on the mainland. Almost half of Taiwanese 
investments on the mainland lost money last year, according to the China Daily 
newspaper, though some may report large losses to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are Chinese, we know what's happening in China," said Tracy Hui, the 
financial manager of the Taiwanese shipping company Bimerco Air Forwarders. 
"But still we face quite a lot of problems -- not necessarily related to 
Taiwan, but things modern societies cannot accept. People ask for money 
(bribes) all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing business in China can be very dangerous," Ni said. Newspapers 
frequently report kidnapings and corruption, and Ni described a Taiwanese 
businessman who was beaten with a steel bar by the military police in China's 
industrial zone of Shenzhen. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these things are frightening," Ni said. "It is more (because China is 
like the) Wild West than because of political reasons, but since there are so 
many Taiwanese businessmen, the chances are higher they will be hit." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Taiwan would like to hold its money card as close to the vest 
as possible. While China's low-cost labor and common culture is appealing for 
business, Taiwan's government is encouraging investors to spread their money 
around other parts of Asia, especially prosperous Southeast Asia, to avoid 
over-dependence on China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more money going to China from Taiwan, the less bargaining power for the 
Taiwanese government," said a Taiwanese banker in Hong Kong. "Those who are 
heavily invested tend to be pro-China." 
</P>
<P>
 The "go South" policy has had some success. Taiwan is one of the top investors 
in Vietnam, and is building up Subic Bay -- the old U.S. Navy base in the 
Philippines -- as an alternative transshipment center to Hong Kong. That would 
hurt Hong Kong as Taiwan's entrepot, but would boost Taiwan's leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Hong Kong is harmed, Taiwan will go independent," predicted a Taiwanese 
investment banker who channels compatriots' funds through the territory. "And 
no one in Beijing wants to be responsible for losing Taiwan." Powerful 
Potential 
</P>
<P>
 China is already a huge economy, but "Greater China" would benefit from 
Taiwanese investment and Hong Kong's services.

THE PRESS; CARTOONISTS 'VOTE' ON CLINTON, PROP.187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. politics proved fair game for the sharp pens of editorial cartoonists in 
Latin America, Europe and Asia last week. Whether in a comical look at Bill 
Clinton amid a herd of GOP elephants or more biting views from Mexico of 
California's Proposition 187, the foreign press showed the midterm elections 
were a big story beyond the U.S. frontier. Whatever the angle, the message was 
clear: a black eye for the Clinton White House.

NATIONAL AGENDA; BOLIVIA TESTING OUT 'INVESTMENT SHOCK'; PRESIDENT WANTS TO 
MAKE FOREIGN INVESTORS AND THE PUBLIC JOINT OWNERS OF SIX HUGE GOVERNMENT-OWNED 
COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Bolivia, where two-thirds of the population lives in poverty, economics is 
always a burning issue. Now it is crackling, popping and throwing off sparks as 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada stakes his presidency on a bold and controversial 
project aimed at making foreign investors and the Bolivian public joint owners 
of six sacred cows, government-owned companies that account for more than half 
of the country's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to generate an "investment shock" that will help pull Bolivians 
out of their poverty -- and perhaps give coca farmers an alternative to growing 
coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine. Bolivia is the world's No. 2 
producer of coca, after neighboring Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez de Lozada accuses his opposition of trying to undermine the plan 
because, he said, they are afraid its success will strengthen him and his 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling them, 'Don't be scared,' " the president said in an interview. 
"If we're really successful, it will be everybody's success, because there is 
no way a party can do this alone. . . . These big changes have to be (by) 
consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez de Lozada, who took office in August, 1993, is giving a new twist to 
the privatization trend that has swept Latin America. Instead of selling off 
the six enterprises, the government will give them away. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called "capitalization." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investors will receive half-ownership of each company in exchange for 
a commitment to invest fresh capital up to the level of the company's value. 
The other half-ownership will be transferred in trust to individual pension 
funds for all Bolivian workers, according to the plan. The foreign investors 
will manage the companies, and private companies will manage the pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The six enterprises to be capitalized are the government's petroleum, 
electricity and telecommunications companies, its biggest smelter, its railroad 
system and its national airline. Economists estimate their total value at $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 With privatization programs in other countries competing for foreign capital, 
Sanchez de Lozada hopes his capitalization scheme will be more attractive to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the classical privatization, you buy the assets," he said, "and then you 
have to spend a lot of money modernizing these assets." Instead, Bolivia wants 
the investors to put all the money into modernizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over five years that will almost double private investment, and you'll still 
maintain state investment," he said. "I'm not saying this is the silver bullet, 
but for five years you're going to have very high rates of growth." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new investment will have a "multiplier effect" that will generate 
500,000 new jobs. Other officials say the planned pension funds, to be modeled 
on neighboring Chile's privately administered retirement system, will also 
become a major source of growth capital as they accumulate future 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members and pensioners staunchly oppose both the capitalization and 
private pension funds. On a recent afternoon, thousands of retired workers 
marched up the Prado, La Paz's busiest avenue, to protest the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down with privatization," shouted Vidal Torres, 62. "Down!" responded a group 
of marchers. Torres predicted that if the country relies on a private pension 
system, "the retirees will be left in the street." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez de Lozada said that a private system is the only way to guarantee 
funding for retirement pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia is the poorest country in South America, with a gross domestic product 
that comes out to less than $1,000 for each of the country's 6.5 million 
people. After years of unstable democracy alternating with military 
dictatorships, the country's battered and mismanaged economy went berserk in 
1985, with hyper-inflation of about 24,000% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, former President Victor Paz Estenssoro took office. With Sanchez de 
Lozada as his planning minister, in charge of economic policy, annual inflation 
dropped to less than 15% in 1987. It is now running at 7.5%, one of the lowest 
rates in Latin America. Economic growth, however, has been far less impressive 
-- about 4% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 To rise from its poverty, Bolivia needs more rapid economic expansion, and 
economists say that requires greater savings and investment. Sanchez de 
Lozada's capitalization plan will be "absolutely vital" for that, the president 
said. "This is like a locomotive that will drag the economy into the levels of 
growth which some of our neighbors have achieved." 
</P>
<P>
 But it will cost money to start up. Not only will the government receive no 
cash from selling the six sacred cows, but it is committed to assuming and 
refinancing nearly $800 million in debts owed by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivians who defend government ownership insist that capitalization is just a 
way to disguise the privatization of strategic state enterprises. Others say 
the capitalization plan will take too long to pull investment into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The president promises that bidding by foreign investors in all six 
enterprises will be completed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Doria Medina, a member of the opposition Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left and a former planning minister, said privatization would be a better and 
faster route than capitalization. But because Sanchez de Lozada "is afraid of 
the people's opposition to privatization, he invented all that invention of 
capitalization," Doria Medina argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Muller, an independent economist, said there is a considerable risk 
that the capitalization program will never attract the capital that Sanchez de 
Lozada is counting on. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez de Lozada denies any risk: "It isn't a gamble in any way. As you think 
about it, it makes so much sense for the investor, and for the Bolivian 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez de Lozada and the opposition agree that in Bolivia's bid for economic 
development, its strongest suits are its location in the heart of South America 
and its wealth of natural resources, such as minerals, gas and farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 In a popular national dream, Bolivians see their country as a booming 
transportation and energy hub that will provide gas, electricity and trade 
routes for its South American neighbors. And that's what makes Bolivia a good 
investment, Sanchez de Lozada said. Private Matters

ETHNIC DISCORD; GREEK-ALBANIAN RELATIONS SOUR OVER TRIAL, MINORITY TREATMENT; 
GREEKS ANGERED BY WHAT THEY VIEW AS DISCRIMINATORY RELIGIOUS AND LANGUAGE 
TRENDS FROM TIRANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of the ethnic Greeks who make up nearly half of this southern city, 
it has taken generations to make their way from the desperately impoverished 
countryside to what passes for the Albanian good life. Gjirokastra is an urban 
wellspring of artists and writers. 
</P>
<P>
 But city living has not erased discrimination. For instance, under Albania's 
newly revised education laws, Greek-speaking children now have to be bused back 
to remote villages if they want to be taught in their native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greek minority here has also been angered by recent government attempts to 
require all religious leaders to be native-born Albanians -- an explicit move 
to expel the Greek-born archbishop heading Albania's Orthodox Church. Relations 
between the Albanian leadership in Tirana and its Greek minority plunged to a 
new low in September when five Greek Albanians were sentenced to six to eight 
years in jail on dubious charges of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 What some human rights observers call evidence of organized repression has 
poisoned relations with neighboring Greece and heightened fears of yet another 
destabilizing conflict on the Balkan peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece has accused the leadership of President Sali Berisha of prosecuting the 
five men, members of a minority-rights movement known as Omonia, in an effort 
to intimidate all Greek Albanians, which Athens numbers upwards of 250,000 but 
Tirana contends are fewer than 60,000. No reliable census figures are 
available, but Western embassies estimate the Greek population as somewhere in 
between. The ethnic Albanian population numbers about 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leaders in Tirana and much of the European diplomatic community 
agree the September trial had strong political overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a trial of five members of the Omonia organization, but a 
political trial of all Greeks," said Arben Imami, head of the opposition 
Democratic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the trial began in mid-August, Greece expelled 70,000 of the estimated 
300,000 Albanians who live and work illegally in the border area. Then, in 
protest of the sentences, Greece closed its northern border to Albanians and 
has used its European Union membership to block $35 million in aid for this 
country until the defendants are released. 
</P>
<P>
 But those actions by its larger neighbor have only spurred defiance in Tirana, 
where the leadership continues what observers describe as an increasing 
tendency toward harassment of the country's minority sectors. The controversial 
actions followed government complaints that Greece was supporting separatist 
activity in this southern region where ethnic Greeks constitute a majority in 
rural areas and a sizable minority in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece occupied southern Albania during World War II, and ultranationalists in 
Athens have at times openly coveted what they call "Northern Epirus." But the 
Greek government has said it lays no territorial claim to any part of Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions flared between Greece and Albania after the mysterious April killings 
of two Albanian recruits at a border camp, which Tirana blamed on Greek 
gangsters. But the Albanians have yet to produce evidence or suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 In apparent retaliation, however, the Albanian judiciary levied charges of 
spying for Athens against the five Greek Albanians, all from the southern 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial coincided with the unveiling of a draft constitution that would have 
expelled Greek Orthodox Archbishop Anastasios Yanulatos and introduced 
restrictive policies on minority education. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the constitution was defeated in a Nov. 6 referendum -- largely 
because of Socialist opposition to the enhanced powers it would have bestowed 
on President Berisha. But the education code remains in force, and its 
restriction of Greek-language education to rural "minority zones" has outraged 
urban Greeks and worried human rights envoys from the International Helsinki 
Committee and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new guidelines, classes are no longer offered in Greek in ethnically 
mixed cities like Gjirokastra, Saranda, Delvina and Korca. Greek is offered as 
a foreign language, but as an alternative to English and only for those 
students who obtain government certification of their Greek ethnicity -- a 
requirement that excludes students whose parents registered as Albanians to 
avoid problems during the former Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 CSCE High Commissioner Max van der Stoel, who is mediating minority disputes 
to avert further regional conflict, suggested earlier this month that the 
Albanian government consider restoring the educational practices it established 
two years ago as a means of easing the primary source of this latest outbreak 
of ethnic tension, a CSCE official disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Leko Bungo, information chief for the ruling Democratic Party, defended the 
government's minority-rights record as "in accordance with international 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kristos Toli, head of the Party for Human Rights, a predominantly Greek 
organization in Gjirokastra, has accused the Tirana government of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has cleansed Greeks from their posts. Greek officers have been 
swept from the army, and all minorities in the police force have been fired," 
Toli said. "I don't understand why the government is doing this. It is driving 
away Greek businessmen who would like to come here and invest, which is hurting 
the government as much as it hurts us." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Greek Albanians expressed fear of reprisals if they spoke openly against 
Berisha, who initially enjoyed widespread Western support. Greeks in 
Gjirokastra and nearby Dervicani insisted their relations with local Albanians 
were cordial. 
</P>
<P>
 Albania's relations with Greece have also suffered because of the protracted 
battle between Athens and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia over the 
latter's insistence on naming itself simply Macedonia. Greece has imposed an 
economic blockade against the landlocked country. But Albania has been 
undermining the Greek action by allowing fuel and goods to be trucked in from 
its Adriatic Sea port of Durres. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirana also enjoys good relations with Turkey, another source of irritation 
for Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Greece's coziness with the Serbian nationalist regime in Belgrade 
worries Tirana, which fears Greece would support or at least tolerate a 
potential Serbian attack on the 2 million ethnic Albanians living in Serbia's 
southern province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
 A Greek diplomat in Tirana, Ekaterini Nassika, concedes her country shares the 
blame for some areas of ethnic tension in the Balkans, but contends Greece has 
a right to promote fair treatment of minority Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not live in the neighborhood of angels," Nassika understated. More on

SPEAKING OF:; ON THEIR LAST LEGS?; WORLD WILDLIFE FUND'S TOP 10 THREATENED 
SPECIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's vulnerable creatures have a friend in CITES, the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. In just two 
decades, the group has grown from 21 to 123 nations devoted to identifying 
threatened plant and animal species and regulating trade in them. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall has been especially active. The private World Wildlife Fund, one of 
the CITES founding groups, releases its second annual list of species most 
threatened by international trade. And this week, delegates from CITES nations, 
private groups, traders, hunters and others are meeting in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., to review the status of about 200 species.

SPECTER STUDIES '96 RUN, BLASTS RELIGIOUS RIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican at odds with the rest of the GOP on 
issues such as abortion, announced a possible presidential bid Monday with a 
swipe at the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator said he is forming an exploratory committee, often a prelude to a 
formal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Specter, 64, who has blamed President George Bush's 1992 loss on a GOP 
convention dominated by the religious right, urged his supporters Monday to 
"outwork and outvote the far-right fringe." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not refer to them as the religious right or the Christian right because 
they do not articulate religious values or Christian values or Judeo-Christian 
values," said Specter, who is Jewish. "Instead, they advocate intolerance. They 
reject brotherhood. They insist on either ruling or ruining." 
</P>
<P>
 The third-term senator and former Philadelphia district attorney became a 
target of women's groups during his 1992 Senate reelection bid because of his 
aggressive questioning of Anita Faye Hill during the hearings on Clarence 
Thomas' Supreme Court nomination.

 USC emerged from its 45-28 victory over Arizona on Saturday with no major 
injuries. Quarterback Rob Johnson, who re-injured his sprained right ankle in 
the fourth quarter and didn't return to the game, was walking without a limp 
afterward and will play Saturday against UCLA.Freshman starting guard Phalen 
Pounds, who has missed six games after an arthroscopic knee procedure, is 
listed as probable for UCLA.

 USC-UCLA history: The last five USC-UCLA games have been decided by a total of 
13 points. . . . UCLA has won the last three games, but USC leads in the 
series, which dates to 1929, 34-22-7. . . . In games in the Rose Bowl, UCLA is 
ahead 4-2, but USC has won two of the last three there. . . . In the last game 
at the Rose Bowl, in 1992, a two-point USC conversion try with 41 seconds left 
failed and UCLA won, 38-37. . . . Of the 63 games in the series, 34 have had 
the Rose Bowl on the line for at least one team and USC leads in those games, 
21-11-2. When the Rose Bowl has been on the line for only USC, the Trojans are 
3-0-1. EARL GUSTKEY

 Spiros Nakos can remain an Olympian on New York's Lower East Side, but he will 
have to lose the rings. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Restaurant, Nakos' 10-table 
coffee shop on Delancey Street, can keep the name for now. In return, Nakos 
agreed to remove the five interlocking Olympic rings from his menu and the sign 
out front.

 The plight of the Greek-American restaurateur, who named his establishment 
Olympic because of national pride, pitted against the multimillion-dollar USOC

 Pittsburgh running back Curtis Martin, urged by his coach and NFL executives 
to stay in school and prove he's healthy, said he will pass up a final year of 
eligibility and turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin rushed for 1,132 yards last season and was leading the nation in 
rushing after a 251-yard game against Texas, but badly sprained an ankle 
against Ohio on Sept. 10 and hasn't played since.

 Because Martin hasn't played after Pitt's fourth game, he could return next

Florida State is in line to be its opponent on Jan. 2 in Dallas. But the

 As far as I could tell, George Raveling was the only college basketball coach 
who belonged to the American Humor Studies Assn. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No others ever wrote weekly columns for the L.A. Herald Examiner and Seattle 
Times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He has built a personal library of more than 3,000 books and a collection of 
thousands of albums and subscribes to nearly 100 newspapers and magazines. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 He initiated the "Reading with Raveling" program in junior high schools. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 He worked endless hours for the Black Coaches Assn. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Basketball Times called him one of the five most intriguing people 
in the sport in 1992. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 His 22-year record of 336-292 was not great. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But his contributions to daily life were. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, they still are. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 George isn't about to leave us, which is pretty terrific considering that he 
nearly lost his life in an automobile accident Sept. 25. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nine broken ribs, a broken pelvis, a broken collarbone, a collapsed lung, and 
the months of rehabilitation that he still faced after a long hospital stay 
told him this might be the right time to quit the USC job, which was going to 
be his last in coaching anyway. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It won't be too long before he resurfaces in sports as an administrator for 
the U.S. Olympic Committee, the NCAA, a coaches' group or some other lucky 
organization. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For certain, Charlie Parker will take his place on the bench at the Sports 
Arena on Wednesday night when the Trojans play New Mexico State in the 
Preseason NIT. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Parker was Athletic Director Mike Garrett's choice as interim head coach. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 I hope Garrett gives Parker every chance to become the permanent coach and is 
realistic about expectations during a season in which the Trojans, who are 
picked to finish seventh in the Pacific 10 Conference, play an unusually tough 
schedule. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you abhor violence, I recommend tonight's Clipper-Laker game at the Sports 
Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This might be the most peaceful rivalry in sports. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Neither team is physical and I have yet to see any of their fans exchange 
insults, let alone blows. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What the Lakers need is a brute of a power forward.Horace Grant would have 
been perfect. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What the Clippers need are NBA caliber players at several positions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fashion note: The Lakers wear black shoes on the road and white at home. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard didn't work during the Forum opener against the Denver Nuggets 
on Friday. Of course, they only had since April 23 to get it ready. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the Sports Arena is the Hustle Board. Not that Bill Fitch's team 
doesn't hustle. It's just that a sponsor couldn't be found. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is how sportswriters and sportscasters predict the Pac-10 race: 1. UCLA, 
2. Arizona, 3. California, 4. Arizona State, 5. Stanford, 6. Oregon, 7. USC, 8. 
Washington State, 9. Washington, 10. Oregon State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tickets still are available at both UCLA and USC box offices for the football 
game Saturday at the Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't there too much talk about playoff hopes before, during, and after the 
Raiders' victory over the Rams? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I mean, that lifted the Raiders all the way up to the .500 mark while the Rams 
dropped to the .400 mark. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-Dallas was one game of the year that lived up to its hype. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 New England Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe threw 17 more passes, 53, after 
halftime against the Minnesota Vikings than the Detroit Lions and Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers threw all night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Bear wide receiver Curtis Conway's touchdown pass against the Miami 
Dolphins was more luck than finesse, but the former USC Trojan was a 
quarterback at Hawthorne High. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez's majority decision over Michael Carbajal in 
Mexico City on Saturday night was a carbon copy of their second fight. Gonzalez 
won it with defense and smarts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After jockey Christine Davenport won a race last week at Bay Meadows, track 
announcer Paul Allen commented, "A well-timed ride." Davenport is Allen's wife. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Al Franken remembers the night in 1961 when fans literally knocked 
down the doors at the Sports Arena to see Wilma Rudolph the year after she had 
won three gold medals in the Olympic Games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We sold out the meet in advance," Franken said. "Some people who couldn't get 
in forced their way through the doors at the east entrance." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Franken said he has worked with few athletes as gracious as Rudolph, who died 
of brain cancer at age 54 Saturday.

NO. 2 SANCHEZ VICARIO GETS UPSTAGED BY NO. 22 HALARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario's oft-heard claim that she might deserve the world's 
No. 1 ranking rather than Steffi Graf was rendered void Monday when she lost to 
the No. 22 player in the world in the opening match of the $3.5-million 
Virginia Slims Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Halard of France upset the U.S. Open champion, 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (7-2), 
before a stunned crowd of 10,378 at Madison Square Garden.Even though this 
season-ending tournament carries with it no computer points, Sanchez Vicario 
had hoped for a strong showing to gain at least a reasonable argument that she 
was superior to Graf, whom she beat in the U.S. Open final. 
</P>
<P>
 Halard, 22, was inconsistent, but strong at the start and end. Sanchez Vicario 
offered only token resistance in the first set, which perhaps fooled Halard 
into thinking she didn't need to press. Dangerous thoughts against the tour's 
best scrambler. 
</P>
<P>
 Loose play in the second set made scrambling a priority for Sanchez Vicario. 
Because she got in only 50% of her first serves, she had to exploit her 
cracking groundstrokes, but met with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 Her best forehand came when she clipped the top off a decorative potted fern 
in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 There was agony enough for two. By the fifth game change, Halard hurled her 
racket to her chair and then slumped into it. Halard was up 40-0 in the sixth 
game of the second set when Sanchez Vicario's forehand showed up. Her exploding 
forehand cross-court winner broke Halard's serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario broke in the fifth game of the final set and looked poised to 
roll. But Halard broke back in the eighth game.

NO-OFFENSE STEELERS WIN AGAIN; PRO FOOTBALL: PITTSBURGH CORNERBACK ROD WOODSON 
AND KICKER GARY ANDERSON KEY 23-10 VICTORY OVER BUFFALO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Woodson has lobbied for years to play both offense and defense for the 
Pittsburgh Steelers. Never has his argument been more persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson, single-handedly accounting for more scoring in the last two weeks 
than Pittsburgh's offense, returned an interception for a touchdown and forced 
a fumble for another to lead the Steelers past the Buffalo Bills, 23-10, Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last five quarters, Woodson has scored one touchdown, almost scored 
another and forced two fumbles -- one of which set up a game-winning field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When plays come your way, you've got to make them," Woodson said after 
Pittsburgh's defense kept the Steelers (7-3) within a game of AFC 
Central-leading Cleveland. "We gamble, we blitz, we make plays, we're playing 
great defense right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Anderson, again the only productive member of the Steelers' no-go 
offense, kicked three field goals to move into sixth place on the NFL's 
all-time list with 302 as Pittsburgh won for the second week in a row without 
an offensive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense tries to score points," said Gerald Williams, who recovered a 
Woodson-forced fumble by Jim Kelly in the end zone. "We talk about it a lot, 
but until tonight we weren't doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson stepped in front of intended receiver Bill Brooks for a 37-yard 
interception return touchdown -- the third of his career -- to put Pittsburgh 
ahead, 10-0, in the final minute of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big play," Woodson said. "We felt we read it, we gambled and it 
worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, with Buffalo down only a touchdown after Kelly's 19-yard scoring pass 
to Andre Reed, a blitzing Woodson dislodged the ball from Kelly near the goal 
line and Williams fell on it for the first touchdown of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even get into the end zone when I was a running back in Pop Warner," 
Williams said. "The ball was laying there like a big bag of candy, and I 
gobbled it right up." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie defensive tackle Brentson Buckner added to the Bills' growing 
frustration, blocking a 32-yard field goal attempt by Steve Christie later in 
the fourth quarter -- Christie's first miss in 18 attempts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who last week kicked a field goal in overtime after Woodson forced a 
critical fumble in the Steelers' 12-9 victory over Houston, is seven for seven 
the last two weeks, 17 for 18 this season and 45 for 48 the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the four-time defending AFC champion Bills (5-5) to .500 in 
November for the first time since finishing 7-8 in 1987. They trail Miami (7-3) 
by two games in the AFC East and must play twice in the next 10 days, against 
Green Bay and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to some of their players after the game, and they seemed in doubt 
about the rest of the season," safety Carnell Lake said. "But a lot can change 
in only a week, and there's a lot of season left." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, sacked six times for 54 yards in losses, was lifted for Frank Reich 
late in the fourth quarter after going 22 for 43 for 212 yards and two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything, this will make us mad," Kelly said. "Maybe that's what we 
really need."

 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler was scared at first, he was sore for a while, but 
he apparently was not seriously injured Sunday when he hyperextended a toe on 
his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter at Anaheim Stadium 
when Ram defensive lineman Gerald Robinson crashed into him as he was 
completing a pass to Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's walking a little gingerly, but we expect he'll be OK by the end of the 
week," said Coach Art Shell on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell would not speculate on how much work Hostetler will get in preparation 
for Sunday's game at the Coliseum against the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Most of the Raider injuries are in the secondary. Cornerback Albert Lewis 
(sprained right knee) and safety Derrick Hoskins (sprained left ankle) sat out 
Sunday's game. Lionel Washington, Lewis' replacement, was hurt when he bumped 
knees with Ram receiver Flipper Anderson. Lewis is not expected to play Sunday, 
but the others could be back if their recuperation continues as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Gerald Perry, who has missed the last four games because of a 
broken right ankle, is expected to start practicing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 How long until he plays? 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't have any discomfort, then we'll sit down and talk about it," 
Shell said. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; CHANDLER HOBBLED BY ANKLE SPRAIN

 Chris Chandler will remain the Rams' starting quarterback if his sprained left 
ankle allows him to play Sunday at San Francisco, Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler sprained the ankle in the second quarter of the 20-17 loss to the 
Raiders on Sunday when defensive tackle Chester McGlockton rolled across it on 
a sack. Chandler, who completed 10 of 11 passes for 171 yards before the 
injury, was replaced by Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox hopes to have Chandler ready to practice by Thursday, but said he will 
give Miller more work in practice this week in case he needs to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be fine, but it's just a matter of when," Chandler said. "It doesn't 
stop it from being real frustrating, though. It seems like I've had a lot of 
guys hit me low this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "(McGlockton) was coming off a block, kind of crawling. He just made a jump 
and came right at my ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "On film, it looked like the knee went. It was close." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler sprained the same ankle in an 8-5 loss to Atlanta on Oct. 2 and was 
not ready to play the next week. Chandler said it took about three weeks to get 
the ankle back to full strength. The ankle was heavily wrapped Monday, and 
Chandler said he can't run on it or twist it without pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said game films show that officials missed three calls in the Raider 
game: An apparent interception by Darryl Henley that was ruled a drop; a 
trapped ball by Raider receiver Tim Brown in the fourth quarter that was ruled 
a catch, and a non-call on Raider receiver Rocket Ismail, who hit Henley in the 
facemask while getting open for a 10-yard touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the Rams will compile a video clip of the mistakes and send them to 
the league office, which they do every week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox expects right tackle Jackie Slater (torn triceps) and right guard Leo 
Goeas (sore abdomen) to be ready for the San Francisco game. . . . Running back 
Johnny Bailey, who missed the Raider game with a sore abdomen, is listed as 
doubtful. . . . Center Bern Brostek (broken right leg) is expected to be out 
another two to three weeks. MIKE REILLEY

 Steve Beuerlein, who injured his left knee during Sunday's 10-9 victory over 
the New York Giants, might be lost to the Arizona Cardinals for two to three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein said a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed torn cartilage, 
which will cause fluid to build up until it is repaired. He said he would 
decide soon whether to have arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Buddy Ryan said Jay Schroeder, 1-1 as a starter for the Cardinals (4-6), 
will play if Beuerlein is unable to. 
</P>

 Andre Waters, the starting strong safety, sprained the arch of his right foot 
in the same game and also might be out this week, when the Philadelphia Eagles 
visit Sun Devil Stadium.

 Coach Norv Turner said rookie Gus Frerotte will make his fourth start in a row

New York Giant Coach Dan Reeves, unhappy with quarterback Kent Graham's play in 
a 10-9 loss to the Cardinals, said he will wait a couple of days before saying 
whether Graham or Dave Brown will start Monday night against the Oilers at 
Houston. . . . New York Jet tackle Jeff Criswell has a hyperextended elbow and 
is out for Sunday's game at Minnesota. Without Criswell, the Jets will be 
missing both starting tackles. Siupeli Malamala still is out with a knee 
injury. . . . Saint running back Derek Brown has a knee sprain and might not 
play against the Raiders. Mario Bates, who rushed for 141 yards Sunday against 
the Falcons, is expected to play despite a bruised shoulder. . . . Falcons 
safety Roger Harper underwent surgery on a broken right forearm and will be 
sidelined the rest of the season.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: CARSON DOESN'T DESERVE BERTH IN CITY PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheaters should not be rewarded with postseason honors, but that is exactly 
what happened last week when Carson was given a berth in the upcoming City 
Section football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts finished the regular season Thursday with a 2-8 record, including 
three losses by forfeit for using an academically ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 The losing record and forfeits did not seem to bother the football advisory 
committee, however, which decided Carson's winning tradition and strength of 
schedule were enough to include it among the City's 16 best teams in the 
Division 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson is the defending 4-A champion, and has won nine City titles in a record 
18 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, City Section officials investigated the school's football 
team two weeks ago and discovered that in three games it had used a sophomore 
transfer student who did not have a qualifying grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson has the worst record in the 4-A bracket, but it was the committee's 
conclusion that it met the criteria of being one of the top teams. The 
committee could have placed the Colts in the 3-A playoffs, which is reserved 
for the 16 best teams not in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put Carson in 3-A, you might as well just hand them the trophy," said 
Barbara Fiege, City commissioner. "Putting them there isn't fair to the other 
15 teams." 
</P>
<P>
 But allowing Carson to compete in the 4-A playoffs is an unfair reward for a 
team that did not abide by the rules. The Colts, who play Northern Conference 
champion Franklin in a first-round game Friday night, should have been placed 
in the 3-A bracket or left out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing Carson to compete for the 4-A title sends a message that receiving 
forfeits for breaking the rules does not mean anything. It is almost as if 
those losses were counted as victories. 
</P>
<P>
 The City could end up having a champion with a 6-8 record, which is not 
exactly good public relations for a section that is desperately trying to shed 
its reputation of always making the wrong decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But that image will not change until it starts making the right decision, and 
this most definitely is not one of them. 
</P>

 Baldwin Park Sierra Vista might have received the most unfavorable draw in the 
Southern Section football playoffs with a road trip to Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington, seeded second in Division VIII at 10-0, has been setting all 
kinds of state scoring records this season, including most points in the 
regular season with 646. It is coming off a 66-8 victory over Riverside Norte 
Vista, the second-place team in its league. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Vista clinched a playoff berth last Thursday with a 22-14 victory over 
La Puente, improving its record to 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington and Sierra Vista both run a wing-T style offense, a cause of 
concern for Sierra Vista Coach Don LeGro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to take the same offense we use and run it down our 
throats," LeGro said. "We're going to line up and do the best we can. Maybe we 
can be the first team to stop them this season." 
</P>

 Alhambra's dream of a perfect season came crashing down last Thursday after it 
was embarrassed, 42-0, by Montebello in the Almont League title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra, enjoying its best season in more than a decade, came into the 
contest with a 9-0 record and No. 2 ranking in the Southern Section's Division 
III media poll. It left wondering what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the capacity crowd of 5,000 had settled in their seats at Alhambra, 
Montebello took a 21-0 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I felt like the game was over at that point," Montebello Coach 
Doug Rihn said. "Nobody was going to come back on us with that kind of a lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra trailed, 35-0, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello, which racked up 472 yards of total offense, was led by quarterback 
Fred Montiel, who rushed for two touchdowns and passed for another and also had 
an interception on defense. 
</P>

 One of the hottest football recruits in the Southland is Ignacio Brache, a 
5-foot-11, 180-pound senior from tiny Village Christian in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance last Saturday against Los Angeles Baptist has helped establish 
Brache as one of the nation's best kickers. His three field goals in that game, 
including a 60-yarder, tied him with three other players for the most field 
goals in a season at 16. He had two opportunities to break the record, but 
attempts from 51 and 52 yards in the fourth quarter fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Brache's field goals this season have been from more than 50 yards. 
The 60-yarder is third-best in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 Brache has been forced to perfect his kicking skills since his mother, Shelly 
Brache, will not allow him to play a position where he would tackle or be 
tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian will be host to Ontario Christian in a Southern Section 
Division X playoff game Friday, giving Brache another shot at the record. Prep

 Los Angeles University picked up a forfeit victory over Fairfax in football 
last Thursday after Fairfax administrators said the school's field was too 
muddy to play on. Because no contingency plan was sought, University was 
awarded the victory. . . . Several football players from Oxnard Hueneme and 
Goleta Dos Pueblos engaged in a brawl during the postgame handshake last 
Thursday. Hueneme Coach Larry Miller said he is recommending two of his players 
be suspended from school for an undetermined time. Dos Pueblos won the game, 
35-28. Times' Top 20 Football Poll

<P>
 Reddi Brake Supply Corp., a little-known firm based in Ventura, is on an 
expansion drive that has seen it grow by threefold in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't heard of Reddi, it's because the company sells brake systems, 
chassis compartments and other car parts to professional mechanics rather than 
the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Reddi now has 72 outlets nationwide, compared with only 18 in October, 1993, 
reports Michael J. Cassidy, the firm's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been through some rough weather because of problems at its 
Wesco parts supply division, but that unit has been sold, Cassidy said. He 
added that Reddi is negotiating a $7-million line of credit with Sumitomo Bank 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to problems at Wesco, we showed a loss in the fiscal year that ended June 
30," Cassidy said. "Now, however, we're operating in the black and planning to 
open more stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Reddi has two outlets in Ventura County -- one in Thousand Oaks and one 
adjoining corporate headquarters in Ventura. The company has 600 employees. 
Cassidy estimates that sales in the current fiscal year will exceed $40 
million.

 The Port Hueneme Chamber of Commerce has voted to support Brac '95, a task

directors stopped short of making a financial contribution to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 A contribution isn't possible at this time, chamber directors said.

<P>
 Brac '95 is made up of defense contractors, government officials and others 
who are concerned about the potential impact of closing the bases at Hueneme 
and Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The group says the endangered bases provide thousands of jobs and pump more 
than $1 billion annually into Ventura County's economy.

 PACK RAT: North Hollywood's Don Hyatt Martin is a collector of, well, 
everything. And the piles of stuff he collects usually become loads of trouble 
for city sanitation workers. On Monday, they spent their eighth day hauling 
away garbage from his house (B6). . . . This is the third time since the 
mid-1980s that city officials have had to clean up his property. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT LINE: For businesses looking for honest feedback from their employees, the 
answer might be Pinkerton. The Encino-based security services company takes 
calls -- anonymously -- from employees who want to complain about unfair 
treatment, harassment and safety concerns. . . . Companies hire Pinkerton to 
provide this service. See Valley Business, Page 4. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW HOMES: The American Dream is alive and well in the Valley. New homes are 
selling, and some banks are getting into real estate development again. That's 
good news for people like Dee Dee and Jack Petty, above, who just moved to 
Woodside Homes. . . . Several large, publicly traded home builders have moved 
in to take advantage of cheap land. See Valley Business, Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 POOCH ON THE LOOSE: Martina Navratilova has never played a big tennis match in 
the Valley, but she once had a big crisis here. In 1986, Navratilova, who 
begins the final tournament of her career today in New York (C4), lost one of 
her precious traveling dogs, Yonni the Shiba, in Sherman Oaks. . . . She 
flooded the area with posters, and offered a $1,000 reward. Yonni was found the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW FACES: Women are making new inroads in the boardroom. More than half of 
the Fortune 500 companies have a woman on their boards, reports Catalyst, a New 
York research group. That comes as no shock to Linda Wachner, CEO of the Van 
Nuys-based Authentic Fitness Corp. . . . "There are tons of intelligent women 
that can give the energy and insight to be a good board member," she says.

 GETTING INSIDE: How much do you hate tobacco smoke? Enough to wear your 
clothes inside-out for a day? . . . . That's what the American Cancer Society 
wants from you on Thursday, for its annual "Great American Smoke-Out" day. It's 
seeking help from hundreds of local companies. Says spokeswoman Jennifer 
Guenette: "If what happens on your inside, happened on your outside, would you 
still smoke?" . . . . Will people really do this? Yes, she says, if they want 
to "lighten up instead of light up." 
</P>
<P>
 BOOMING MORNING: What happens in Southern California when your walls shake a 
little and you hear a booming noise? . . . . "I thought it was an earthquake," 
says Lettie Ajawara of Mission Viejo. This time it was something in the air, 
not in the ground. . . . Monday morning the space shuttle Atlantis landed at 
Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert -- instead of Florida as planned. 
The booming sound as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere about 7:30 a.m. could 
be heard throughout the county.

 MEGA-GIVERS: After years of generous giving -- in time and money -- by 
developer Charles Hester and his wife, Nora, of Corona del Mar, the thank-yous 
are rolling in. . . . Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian this year honored 
them as the "Sweet Heart Couple" for their efforts. Now, in one week's span, 
they've been chosen honorary chair for events by both Chapman University and 
the Boys and Girls Clubs. Today the couple will be honored at a breakfast at 
the Hyatt Regency Irvine Hotel on National Philanthropy Day, by the local 
society of fund-raising executives.

<P>
 FAMILIAR FACE? The Southern Section high school football playoffs usually 
offer local teams a chance to play unfamiliar opponents. But not in Division V 
this year -- all its 16 teams are from Orange County (Prep Extra, V1). . . . 
Top seeded is Sea View League champion Newport Harbor Sailors (10-0). No. 2 is 
the Savanna Rebels of Anaheim (8-2), the Orange League champion.

BASE ADVOCATES CALL PENTAGON MEMO FLAWED; MILITARY: GALLEGLY SAYS REPORT 
ADVISING CLOSURE OF POINT MUGU NAVY INSTALLATION IS PLAGUED WITH ERRORS. LOCAL 
DELEGATION PLANS TO LOBBY WASHINGTON DIRECTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving swiftly to protect the Point Mugu Navy base and its 9,000 jobs, local 
supporters on Monday criticized the accuracy and legitimacy of a confidential 
Pentagon report that recommends shutting down the base and transferring its 
operations to other installations. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Monday that the report is 
plagued with incorrect assumptions and miscalculations. He said he has renewed 
his request to Pentagon officials that the report be withdrawn so that it does 
not "unfairly influence" next year's round of base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other Point Mugu supporters said they plan to discredit the 
report's conclusions next month during a four-day lobbying trip to Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will certainly be one of the purposes to go to D.C.," said Supervisor 
John K. Flynn, who will help lead the delegation to the nation's capital on 
Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need to just neutralize this one report," Flynn said, "but to turn 
it around and show that Point Mugu and Port Hueneme are unique facilities 
needed by the nation's military." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Navy complaints about the report's accuracy, the Defense Department 
inspector general's office issued the audit on June 8, concluding that 
taxpayers could save $1.7 billion over the next 20 years if Point Mugu cuts 
about 1,000 jobs and moves the rest to other bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Public disclosure of the report in Sunday's edition of The Times has 
heightened concern among workers at Point Mugu and Navy supporters in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Dana B. McKinney, commander of Point Mugu, said he is concerned about 
"the anxiety level of our people" on base and said the report was supposed to 
remain out of public view to avoid causing unnecessary alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney emphasized that Pentagon officials are reviewing every base in the 
nation. And, he said, until the list of bases recommended for closure is 
released in March, any other suggestion about which bases might close is "pure 
speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Maggie Kildee said residents need as much information as 
possible so they can judge the rumors swirling around about potential base 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing is the community needs to be aware that it is a very real 
threat," Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the community also needs to be aware of the efforts of the local BRAC 
'95 Task Force -- named for the base realignment and closure process -- which 
has raised about $200,000 to argue the case for preserving Navy bases at Point 
Mugu and Port Hueneme. Kildee will join the task force's delegation to 
Washington next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 57-page report, the Defense Department's inspector general recommends 
moving most of Point Mugu's missile-testing operations and about 2,000 jobs to 
its sister base at China Lake, 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles in the upper 
Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the consolidation would eliminate duplicative functions at the 
two bases, which test high-tech weaponry as members of the Naval Air Warfare 
Center, Weapons Division. 
</P>
<P>
 It suggests moving another 1,000 workers to a soon-to-be vacated engineering 
lab at nearby Port Hueneme. A few would remain behind to operate Point Mugu's 
airfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also recommends dispersing the 1,500 uniformed personnel and their 
Navy operations, which are "tenants" at Point Mugu. However, it does not 
address the 3,000 contract workers who work on base as employees of private 
defense firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general auditors said taxpayers would see no savings in the 
first six years because moving costs would run as high as $518 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials have sharply criticized the report as flawed and based on 
incorrect assumptions -- a criticism echoed in letters released by Gallegly. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Deputy Inspector General Derek J. Vander Schaaf on Oct. 6, 
Gallegly points out that projected savings were based on the assumption that 
Point Mugu is scheduled for a major reduction in workload. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, auditors projected that ongoing testing work on the F/A-18 
Hornet jet fighter would amount to $15 million rather than the Navy's estimate 
of $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He also took issue with the recommendation to move the missile-test range 
operation to a Navy laboratory at the mouth of the Port of Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote that the auditors failed to take into account that the antennas and 
other equipment need wide open spaces to function properly. The harbor would 
not provide a suitable place to safely monitor missiles fired over Point Mugu's 
36,000-square-mile sea test range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two such glaring miscalculations, alone, would seem to discredit your 
report," Gallegly wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman also wrote that he believes the report may violate the 
nation's base closure and realignment law. That law prohibits any Pentagon 
agency from spending money to identify any base for closure unless it is part 
of the official base closure and realignment process. 
</P>
<P>
 Vander Schaaf has yet to respond to Gallegly's latest letter. But last year, 
Vander Schaaf assured the congressman that the $400,000 audit did not violate 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Robert J. Lieberman, the Defense Department's assistant inspector 
general for auditing, has said his office has the authority to scrutinize bases 
for closure under the law because it is helping verify all data submitted by 
the Navy and other military branches.

MALATHION SPRAYING RESUMES AS HIGH WINDS DIE DOWN; MEDFLY: AERIAL PESTICIDE 
ASSAULT CONTINUES AFTER LAST WEEK'S POSTPONEMENT WHEN A STORM ROLLED THROUGH 
THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite blustery winds and the threat of another postponement, state 
helicopters sprayed malathion over a 16-square-mile quadrant of eastern 
Camarillo on Monday night in a continuing effort to eradicate Medflies in this 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Because state regulations prevent the application of the pesticide if winds 
exceed 10 m.p.h., state officials had worried that they would have to abort 
their mission for the second time in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 9:30 p.m., half an hour after the scheduled takeoff time, winds had 
dropped below 8 m.p.h. and three helicopters left Camarillo Airport for four 
hours of low-level spraying of a sticky mixture of corn syrup and the malathion 
pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some real concerns this morning about the winds," said Larry Hawkins, 
a spokesman for the state Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, agriculture officials called off a planned third application 
of the mixture when a fast-moving Gulf of Alaska storm rolled through the area. 
Officials rescheduled the spraying for Monday night when dry, clear skies were 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the flights, Hawkins had said that 8 to 9 m.p.h. winds would force the 
helicopters to alter spraying patterns to avoid an unwanted drift of the 
pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilots will move over a couple of flight lanes if needed so as to prevent 
any unnecessary drift," he said. "We will be constantly feeding them 
information on wind velocity and direction. If at any point the wind exceeds 10 
m.p.h., they'll return to the airport and go on standby." 
</P>
<P>
 As 15 to 20 m.p.h. winds whipped the county Monday, officials said they feared 
a second delay in spraying, because that could damage the effectiveness of 
malathion. The pesticide was first sprayed Oct. 12, then again two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a critical point in the schedule," said W. Earl McPhail, the 
county's agriculture commissioner. "As the flies emerge from their pupal stage, 
we want to make sure there's bait out there to attract them. We don't want to 
take any chances." 
</P>
<P>
 An 86-square-mile quarantine zone was established after Medflies were 
discovered Sept. 29 near St. John's Seminary. So far, 63 of the pests have been 
discovered, but there has not been a new find since Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to continue applying the pesticide until early next year -- or 
until three life cycles of the crop-destroying pest have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of GASP (Group Against Spraying People) met the pesticide-laden 
helicopter squadron at the airport Monday night, again protesting the operation 
by carrying placards in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just praying that the winds stay high," spokesman Leonard Mehlmauer 
said.

FUMING FLIERS ; PILOTS OPPOSE PLAN FOR SHOPPING AREA NEAR RUNWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County pilots are fuming over a developer's proposal to build a 
shopping center across from a runway at Oxnard Airport, arguing that the plan 
could increase the potential for catastrophe in any future air crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the worst spots to put something in," said pilot David Madison. 
"It's right under the final approach path, and that end of the runway is 
sometimes used for takeoffs. If a problem were to develop, you would probably 
end up in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing potential safety hazards, the Oxnard Planning Commission voted last 
month to block the proposed shopping center, which would be located northeast 
of Ventura Road and Fifth Street and would contain an Albertson's supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oxnard City Council today will consider reversing the Planning 
Commission's decision. Staff members in a city report recommend approving the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots say the Oxnard City Council -- which reversed a similar Planning 
Commission decision in 1992, allowing a McDonald's restaurant to be built near 
the same runway -- has not responded to concerns about the possibility for 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ousley, president of the Ventura County Aviation Assn., said the 
potential for a tragedy would be great if the development is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited as an example of what could happen a Sacramento crash during the 
early 1970s where a plane smashed into an ice cream parlor next to the runway 
and killed 23 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big crash in Sacramento, over at Farrell's Ice Cream, that's what we're 
all thinking about," said Ousley, who works for a company at Oxnard Airport. 
"That's what has a lot of us concerned, when the runway is used for takeoff." 
In addition to countless recreational aircraft, 28 commercial flights -- all 
small, 18-passenger planes -- pass through Oxnard Airport every day, said John 
Dodd, operations supervisor for the Ventura County Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd said no crashes have occurred at the site since about 10 years ago when a 
single-engine plane went down in the Abex industrial lot adjacent to the 
airport, killing the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard staff members are recommending that the City Council approve the 
development because it is outside the airport's inner safety zone and runway 
protection zone, the legal boundaries for development required by the Oxnard 
Airport and Ventura County Airport Land Use Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration reviewed the project and found that it met 
all adopted land-use standards, according to a city report. But like the 
McDonald's, a portion of the shopping center's parking lot would be located 
within the safety zone, and no environmental impact report has been done on the 
possible effects of the development, Ousley said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The runway clear zone should be kept open from parking lots or development," 
Ousley said. "Without an EIR (environmental impact report), we don't see how it 
can be approved. We think the McDonald's was a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Ousley said the pilots are considering legal action against Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, if anyone dies there, it's on their hands," Ousley 
said. "They are responsible. The developers and the Oxnard City Council are 
walking hand in hand and encroaching on the airport."  
</P>
<P>
 Madison said he and other pilots realize that the area surrounding the airport 
will eventually be developed, but they want the projects to be out of the way 
of their flight paths. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want something that is compatible with the airport, not something that is 
going to pose a danger to the pilots and the community," Madison said. "We're 
worried that the airport will end up getting surrounded by safety hazards and 
will end up getting shut down."  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said that since his tenure as a planning 
commissioner in the 1970s he has seen four projects proposed for the site in 
question, including a large health club, and this is the most reasonable.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is by far the least intrusive of any proposed development we have had 
there," Lopez said. "Unless there is something there I'm not aware of, I would 
be inclined to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Lopez added, plane crashes will always occur, and all you can do is 
abide by the federal, state and local safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can crash just as easily into City Hall or elsewhere," Lopez said. 
Planes crash everywhere, you just have to obey the existing safety laws and 
hope for the best."

FEWER STUDENTS COLLEGE-BOUND; WEST COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS LAGGING IN PUPILS 
ENROLLING AT 4-YEAR CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 From Camarillo to Ventura, every high school in west Ventura County lags 
behind the state average in the number of graduates going on to four-year state 
universities, a new state report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Although students at many local schools outperformed their peers across the 
state on college-entrance exams, fewer of them are enrolling as freshmen in 
either the University of California or Cal State University systems. 
</P>
<P>
 And many schools are also falling short on the number of students taking the 
rigorous academic courses required for admission to UC. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, only 11.2% of graduates from Ventura County high schools enrolled 
as freshmen in 1992-93 in either the UC or Cal State University systems, fewer 
than the 14.2% average statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are county high schools sending fewer graduates to four-year 
universities, they are also failing to prepare them for college careers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of county high school students who were studying geometry, learning a 
foreign language or taking other courses required by UC during 1992-93 was only 
42.6%, compared to 47.4% statewide, the report from the state Department of 
Education shows. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, county students who take college-prep courses are more 
likely to finish the full regimen of classwork than their counterparts 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers indicate that high school officials are directing only 
college-prep students into the rigorous courses, said county Superintendent of 
Schools Charles Weis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a good job of sorting them," he said. "I'm not saying that's the 
right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said he is also alarmed at the low rate of students going on to four-year 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a long-term economic difference for our children," he said. "We know 
that in the future, the amount of education you have will be directly related 
to your income. With our kids having a (low) four-year attendance rate, we're 
creating a destiny for them of lower economic wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 But Weis and others believe the main reason students are not choosing state 
universities is the lack of a UC or Cal State campus in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools are not accessible," said Ventura High counselor Bob Collins. "We 
have no major college campus in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some local graduates attend the Ventura satellite campus of Cal State 
Northridge, many others drive to classes at UC Santa Barbara, UCLA or Cal State 
Northridge. But commuting is not an option for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you can afford to live at a four-year university, driving is kind of 
impossible from Fillmore, or difficult at best," said Jane Kampbell, assistant 
superintendent for the Fillmore Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But moving to a campus means adding the cost of room and board to tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 And many graduates apparently decide instead to start out at a community 
college, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be a matter of money and convenience," said Pat Chandler, an 
assistant superintendent for the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 While some community college students later move on to a state university, a 
study released in July showed that the transfer rate at Ventura County's three 
two-year colleges significantly trails the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 14.3% of graduates from Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges move on to 
a state university, compared to 19% throughout California, according to the 
report by the Center for the Study of Community Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The state report that was released today fails to take account of graduates 
who attend community colleges or those who go on to private four-year colleges 
or public university in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 But county school officials said the rate at which students move on to UC or 
Cal State is a good indicator of the overall numbers moving on to four-year 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The state released its report on California high schools to give parents and 
the public a snapshot of how well schools and districts are doing. Besides 
comparing schools' success at sending graduates to universities, the state 
report also used several other measures of performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On most of these, Ventura County schools surpassed the state average: 
</P>
<P>
 * County high school students had overall higher scores in 1992-93 on the 
now-defunct California Learning Assessment System exams, or CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura County had more students scoring above the national average on the 
SAT and ACT college entrance exams -- 20.8% compared to 19% statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county had a lower dropout rate: About 90% of local students finish high 
school, while only 83.5% statewide stay in school long enough to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Ventura County students are staying in school, they are taking 
fewer rigorous academic classes while they are there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard Union High School District, all the high schools except 
Camarillo High lagged behind the state in the numbers of students taking 
courses that qualify for UC admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo High has a high percentage of students who plan to attend four-year 
universities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the other four district schools, particularly Channel Islands and 
Hueneme high schools, relatively few students plan college careers, Oxnard 
district Assistant Superintendent Gary Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the district sees no point in guiding students without college plans into 
the UC-preparatory courses, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're not planning to go to a four-year college or university, I would 
not expect them to enroll in a course of study that meets UC requirements," he 
said. "Maybe they want to have a different kind of job that doesn't require 
two-year or four-year training. I would hope that we wouldn't (conclude) that 
only students in (college-prep) courses are getting a high-level education." 
</P>
<P>
 Some school officials disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High School counselor Bob Collins said Ventura High encourages all 
incoming freshmen to take college-preparatory courses, even if they have no 
plans for college. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I tell the ninth-graders that are coming in is that for every UC-type 
class you do not take, you close a door for yourself," Collins said. "We 
encourage them to take them because it opens more doors later on." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat McCabe, a state administrator for research and evaluation, acknowledges 
that many students do not go on to university. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The UC and Cal State systems currently accept less than 30% of the state's 
high school graduates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even students with no plans for college need some academically rigorous 
courses, he said. "They need a mix. That's all we're saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent Weis said it is even more important today than in the past for 
all students to learn higher-level math and other critical-thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no more jobs for people that work only with their hands," Weis 
said. "It's not an either-or thing like we used to have: You're either going to 
be a mechanic or a brain surgeon. Even being on the factory line of Ford you 
need to understand statistics."

ARMORY READY FOR DUTY AS SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS; OXNARD: THE RED CROSS WILL 
TURN OVER SUPERVISION OF THE COLD-WEATHER PROGRAM AFTER THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the scheduled opening of Ventura County's largest cold-weather shelter 
less than a week away, the American Red Cross is gearing up to run the program 
one last season before turning it over to an agency better suited to meeting 
the needs of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County chapter of the Red Cross has operated the emergency shelter 
at the National Guard Armory in Oxnard since it opened seven years ago, heading 
a volunteer effort that last winter shielded more than 800 homeless people from 
the bone-chilling cold. 
</P>
<P>
 But Red Cross officials say they have realized that managing the program is 
beyond the scope of their mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American Red Cross is an emergency service organization that provides 
immediate emergency relief, and this has become an ongoing effort rather than 
an emergency effort," said Richard Rink, coordinator of the shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thinking about the homeless and the best way to provide services to 
them," Rink added. "And if the best way to provide services is to transition 
this program to another agency, that's what we are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Ventura-based Project Understanding agreed to seek the county's 
permission to take over the program, starting next fall. The state makes the 
armories available to the homeless but the county administers the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Pearson, executive director of the nonprofit group, said board members 
agreed to take on the project with the expectation that church groups and other 
agencies would continue to help keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big step for us," said Pearson, noting that until now Project 
Understanding has concentrated its efforts in Ventura and the Ojai Valley. "It 
just became clear that not a lot of people were going to show an interest in 
taking over operation of the warming shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard armory opened to the homeless in 1987, after then-Gov. George 
Deukmejian ordered the California National Guard to open armories across the 
state to provide overnight shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter of 1988-89, the Oxnard armory provided shelter for 516 homeless 
people. In the winter of 1991-92 -- when back-to-back storms produced a raging 
flood that killed four people, including a homeless man on the Ventura River 
bottom -- that number soared to 803. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, 863 homeless people used the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to increase each year," Rink said. "But we've made it a rule never 
to turn anyone away. This is their last option. We will find something." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the armory may open as soon as next Monday and will operate through 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an agreement with the state, the Red Cross can use the armory 
before Dec. 15 if weather forecasts indicate nighttime temperatures below 40 
degrees, or below 50 with a chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next Monday, Red Cross officials will monitor forecasts to see if 
they can open the shelter each night. From Dec. 15 on, the armory will be open 
every night through March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The armory, at 351 S. K St., is supposed to accommodate only 120 people, but 
it has held as many as 150. When the doors open at 7 p.m., the homeless get a 
hot meal, a shower and a place to rest for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, they are served a small breakfast and must be out by 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people from across the county use the Oxnard shelter, which serves 
more than 100 people a night. Many use the shelter on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the clients are men, but there are women and children too.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do have more families than we'd like to see," Rink said. "There are quite 
a few nights where we are running around helping change diapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rink said the Red Cross is ready to help Project Understanding take over 
management of the program, and that there will be no lack of community support 
to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still going to be around to work in a collaborative effort," he said. 
"I know I plan to be an emergency warming shelter volunteer for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Oxnard armory, other warming shelters throughout the county 
are scheduled to open soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, the Ojai Valley Family Shelter -- with 20 beds for men, women and 
families -- is scheduled to open today. And in Thousand Oaks, the Conejo Valley 
Winter Shelter is scheduled to open Dec. 1. That facility also has 20 beds.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; 2 MISSING HIKERS FOUND IN CANYON

<P>
 Two men who wandered off a well-kept trail in Matilija Canyon on Saturday 
spent two nights in the wilderness before being located by search-and-rescue 
crews early Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Seebirt, 56, of Ojai and his friend, Bill Hallfish, 59, of Camarillo 
made contact with rescue workers about 1:30 a.m. Monday when the rescue party 
lit up the canyon in which the two men were camping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got onto a trail that was not maintained and was badly overgrown," Seebirt 
said Monday at his Ojai home. The two men were given food and water, but 
required no medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fighting our way through the dense brush, and it was just too 
time-consuming," he said. "Darkness overtook us." Ill-prepared for a night in 
the cold, the two men were able to light a fire and keep warm, slowly drinking 
what little water they had left. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you were right in front of the fire, your body temperature stayed 
all right," Seebirt said. "But you reach behind you and you could feel the 
frost on your arms." 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday morning, when rescuers began scouring the mountains for signs of the 
men, Seebirt and Hallfish were out of water. A helicopter passed within 200 
feet of them early Sunday, but the crew failed to see them through the dense 
thickets of brush, Seebirt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a compass and a map of the area, the two hikers found a creek and 
made camp Sunday afternoon before being found a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to walk out on their own and we, of course, said, 'No way.' " 
search coordinator Glenn Conley said. "They'd been out 48 hours without food, 
proper clothing and water." JEFF McDONALD

 The Oxnard City Council today is expected to name a city softball field in 
honor of Police Officer James O'Brien, who was shot and killed last year while 
trying to stop the murderous rampage of Alan Winterbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly renovated softball field at Beck Park at C and Kamala streets in 
south Oxnard, would be dedicated Nov. 22 in memory of the 10-year veteran, who 
was active in local boxing and karate programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the things that Jim did with kids, it will be nice to know that his 
name will live on in a facility they use," Assistant Police Chief Tom Cady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winterbourne killed four people and injured three others during a shooting 
spree last December before being gunned down by Oxnard police outside a Ventura 
unemployment office. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LIBRARY BOOSTER WINS STATE HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak View resident Linda Kapala has been given the 1994 President's Award by 
the California Library Assn., in recognition of a series of campaigns she 
launched that helped raise more than $30,000 for Ventura County libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 In one campaign, "Libraries Are Everyone's Business," she arranged for direct 
mailings to 13,000 businesses requesting donations for books.And in another 
campaign, "Libraries Make Cents," about 75,000 Ventura County students 
collected pennies to help the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California Library Assn. is happy for the opportunity to recognize such a 
champion of libraries," said Joy Thomas, president of the statewide 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's Award is given to people who have made outstanding 
contributions in support of California libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapala picked up the award Saturday at the California Library Assn. Convention 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really an unexpected honor," Kapala said Monday. "I'm just delighted, 
I'm so honored." 
</P>
<P>
 Kapala, an avid library user, launched the fund-raising campaign in 1993, 
after becoming aware of the financial hardship experienced by the county's 
Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapala said that in addition to raising much-needed money for county 
libraries, the fund-raising campaign has increased community awareness about 
the plight of libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we let the library issue die, it's too easy to bury," Kapala said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BIKE RODEO ROPES IN STUDENTS FOR TRAFFIC 
SAFETY CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Eleven-year-old Adam Maingot deftly steered his small mountain bike through a 
series of orange plastic cones set six feet apart on the blacktop at Poinsettia 
Elementary School in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty easy," the fifth-grader said, moments after notching a perfect 
score on the obstacle course. "I've done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 Maingot was among more than 30 students who participated Monday in the 
campus's bicycle rodeo, a six-part program designed to teach children to ride 
their bikes safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annually, a lot of children are injured riding their bikes," said Principal 
Dan Munday. "So this is just another way to make them as bicycle-aware and as 
traffic-safe as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the goings-on Monday, the students will be among the safest around. 
The third- through fifth-graders were given a series of challenges designed to 
measure their bike-riding skills and teach them to be on the lookout for 
potential hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were tested for balancing at slow speeds, double-circling, the 
obstacle course, steering, signaling and braking, and stopping. Students were 
awarded up to 10 points in each category, and given two bonus points for 
wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 The top scorers from Poinsettia and other schools that held similar rodeos 
this fall will compete in the All-City Bicycle Rodeo Finals to be held at Buena 
High School on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to educate the children to ride safely, and use helmets and bike 
lanes," said Margaret E. Stallings, the bicycle safety program director for the 
city of Ventura, which hosts the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old honor student Christopher Grasmugg was killed in September 
when he was struck by a passing car as he was riding his bicycle near 
Juanamaria Elementary School in Ventura. Stallings said she hopes a tragedy 
like that never happens again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cars can't always see the children, so we want them to be aware so they can 
be safe in their riding habits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Kennedy of the Automobile Club of Southern California spent much of the 
afternoon safety-checking as many bikes as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at the general condition of the bike, checking for reflectors, 
head lights, making sure the brakes work," Kennedy said, diagnosing loose 
spokes on the front wheel of a small mountain bike. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; HMO SEEKS OK FOR MEDICAL BUILDING

<P>
 In an effort to retain more doctors who practice family medicine, Foundation 
Health Inc. will ask the Camarillo Planning Commission tonight to approve its 
proposal to build a 19,120-square-foot building in eastern Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-story building would include examining rooms, X-ray laboratories 
and a pharmacy, said company spokesman Kurt Davis.The building is proposed for 
a vacant three-acre parcel near Adolfo Road and Avenida Acaso. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said that health maintenance organizations such as Foundation Health 
have recently found themselves vying with other organizations to retain general 
medical practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, about a dozen doctors under contract with the company run their 
practices out of their own facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we are offering our doctors a chance to work in a facility that 
would house all of their basic medical needs under one roof," Davis said. "They 
would be left alone to practice the art of medicine and not have to worry about 
the overhead." Davis said the project will cost the company an estimated $4 
million to $5 million and could be completed by June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation Health is the largest group health-care provider in Ventura County 
with more than 30,000 members. The company is currently considering plans to 
build similar-sized buildings in Ventura and Oxnard, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will consider the application tonight at 7:30 at City 
Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. J.E. MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to prevent a repeat of last year's devastating firestorms, 
federal and state officials are making available more than $10 million in fire 
prevention grants for cities, nonprofit groups and special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Kishton, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said 
the grants can be used to develop fire prevention education programs and 
uniform fire prevention laws.He said the grant program is being partly funded 
through the California Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must be able to match 25% of a grant with their own funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishton said any fire prevention proposal will be considered, but those 
programs dealing with vegetation and brush management, fire prevention 
education and programs to identify high hazard fire zones will be given 
priority. J. E. MITCHELL

 The Thousand Oaks High School band and color guard, competing against 
counterparts from Lompoc to San Diego, won the first Surf City Band Tournament 
in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The band was crowned the sweepstakes winner after competing against 13 other 
bands Saturday at Huntington Beach High School, said band publicist Christine 
Patti. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third sweepstakes win for the band since Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bill Hoehne directing, the 114-member band and 22-member color guard 
marched on the field while playing selections from "Pee-wee's Big Adventure," 
Fun House, Variation 19 and Cirque de Soleil, a contemporary musical. 
</P>
<P>
 The band also placed first in the open class and won top individual awards for 
general effect, music, marching, percussion and color guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Torrence, a member of the Jan and Dean pop music duo from the 1960s, 
presented the awards to the Thousand Oaks band. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the Thousand Oaks band will travel to Arcadia for a parade 
competition and then a field competition later in the evening at Savanna High 
School in Anaheim. GREG RIPPEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; JUDGE WEIGHS DATE FOR T-SHIRT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys representing a 14-year-old Simi Valley student urged a federal judge 
Monday to set a January trial date for their 1st Amendment case against Simi 
Valley school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But school lawyers requested that the case be pushed back until next May -- 
just one month before Valley View Junior High School ninth-grader John Spindler 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Court Judge Irving Hill on Monday heard arguments in the case 
involving Spindler, but postponed setting a trial date until next week. Hill 
criticized defense attorneys' request for a spring trial date and told lawyers 
the case should go to trial early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not convinced that very much more time is needed," Hill said. "I want 
you to confer with each other and come back with a true schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 "You talk about May," he said later during the 2 1/2-hour hearing. "The school 
year would almost be over by then." 
</P>
<P>
 Spindler was barred from attending classes earlier this school year for 
wearing patriotic T-shirts that did not follow Valley View's strict dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 In late September, American Civil Liberties Union lawyers filed a federal 
lawsuit against school officials for violating the boy's constitutional right 
to express himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District's five board members and Valley View 
Principal Don Gaudioso are named in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Carol Woo filed a motion requesting that the trustees not be 
named as defendants in the case because they did not write the school's dress 
code policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hill denied her motion Monday, citing the ACLU's argument that board 
members took no steps to repeal the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were disappointed that the motion was denied," Woo said after the hearing. 
"We don't believe the school board is a proper party in this action." TRACY

COUNCIL SUPPORTS BASEBALL STADIUM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Handing a resounding "Yes" to stadium organizers, Ventura City Council members 
agreed Monday that they would like to have a minor league baseball stadium on 
35 acres near the Ventura Auto Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need something to happen here in this community, and we need it to happen 
now," said Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures after the unanimous vote."I think 
it's really exciting that we could all be sitting in the stands together in 
April, 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest votes on the issue, however, are yet to come. Oxnard's City 
Council is scheduled to vote on the matter today, and the Camarillo City 
Council will consider the item on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 A stadium committee composed of officials from all three cities looked at four 
possible sites for the $15-million, 5,500-seat stadium, which is slated to open 
in the spring of 1996. Of the three other sites, two were in Camarillo and one 
was in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Camarillo officials are still insisting that land near Camarillo Airport 
would be much better suited to a baseball stadium for a Class A baseball team 
than the parcel in eastern Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to other council members, an Oxnard councilman likewise touted the 
merits of a 49-acre Oxnard site on Rice Avenue near Gonzalez Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura officials say they are optimistic that they can work out 
differences among the three cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone through a process, we've all agreed on the consultant; this is the 
preferred site and I think it's a clean deal," Ventura Councilman Gregory L. 
Carson said. "I hope we stay on board." CONSTANCE SOMMER

LAUNDRY DESIGNATED HISTORIC LANDMARK

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to retain $100,000 in state grants, the Ventura City Council 
agreed Monday to designate an antique Spanish laundry as a local historic 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been in a dispute with the state Office of Historic Preservation 
over the money since May. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials maintain that they awarded the grant for the express purpose 
of preserving Peirano's market, an old Italian grocery that was built on Main 
Street in 1877. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city, which now owns the defunct market, wants to tear down part of 
its walls and build a small shopping area in the interior and showcase the 
lavanderia, or laundry, which lies under the market's storage rooms. According 
to the city, the lavanderia was built in 1782 and thus is just as deserving of 
the landmark designation -- and the money -- as is the aging grocery. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, however, state officials said they did not think the new 
designation would persuade them to let Ventura keep the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that's quite a discovery they found," said Joyce Law, the grants 
coordinator for the historic preservation office. But she said the state "will 
probably stay by the same decision," because the grant was given for the 
particular purpose of preserving Peirano's market. CONSTANCE SOMMER

BOARD TO CONSIDER 1ST CHARTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai school board has set a public hearing for tonight to decide the fate 
of what would be Ventura County's first charter school, a publicly funded 
institution largely free from the constraints of the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 Deanna Nakosteen, a former teacher in Ojai, has proposed launching a small 
school called Discovery Charter School in the city's downtown. It would begin 
with about 15 students and later expand, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With small classes, individualized instruction and an emphasis on the fine 
arts, the school would be modeled after the now-defunct private Discovery 
School that Nakosteen ran out of her home for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a state charter school law passed in 1992, Nakosteen would get from the 
state the same level of funding that goes to school districts -- about $3,200 a 
student per year. 
</P>
<P>
 She would be able to spend the money as she needs, possibly saving money on 
overhead by contracting out for services such as school maintenance that school 
districts normally provide. 
</P>
<P>
 And although she would have to meet state rules to hold school the same number 
of days as public schools, Nakosteen would be free of requirements to allot a 
minimum amount of time to various subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she could structure the school days as she liked. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ojai Unified School District would remain legally liable for the 
school's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 And some school officials have said they are concerned about having a lot of 
responsibility for a school over which they have little control. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows up to 100 charter schools in California. So far there are 
about 70, with none in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a heated debate two years ago that focused on the shortcomings of 
public schools, state lawmakers passed the charter school law to give parents 
more choice in where their children go to school. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BUSINESS BURGLARIES UNDER 
INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies in Thousand Oaks are investigating a series of commercial 
burglaries that occurred early Monday, when someone broke into three businesses 
and tried to burglarize a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Larry Meyers of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said the thief or 
thieves used an unknown object to pry open the front doors of three businesses 
within a few blocks of each other between 4 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all around in that time window and it looks like the same method 
was used to get in," Meyers said. "So we think they might be related." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said the burglaries occurred at the Chevron gas station on Moorpark 
Road; Southern Fitness Workout, 280 N. Moorpark Road; Quick Print Plus, 360 E. 
Thousand Oaks Blvd.; and Cinnamon Rolls Etc., 1625 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglar or burglars forced their way into the Chevron station and the 
fitness center, breaking into the registers and stealing small amounts of cash, 
Meyers said. But nothing was taken from the Quick Print Plus store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of an attempted break-in were apparent at the bakery, but no one got 
inside the store, Meyers said. Anyone with information about the burglaries is 
asked to call the Sheriff's Department at 494-8200. JEFF McDONALD

MAN DEFENDS HIMSELF IN MOLEST CASE; COURTS: NURSE'S AIDE VICTOR SUMNER IS 
CROSS-EXAMINING WITNESSES WHO CLAIM HE FONDLED THEM. HE HAS ACCESS TO THEIR 
ADDRESSES.

<P>
 In a highly unusual sexual molestation trial in Simi Valley, the defendant has 
been allowed to function as his own lawyer -- putting him in position to 
revisit his alleged crimes with his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is he cross-examining them, but as defense counsel he has access to 
their phone numbers and addresses. One victim said Monday that she was 
frightened because when the alleged crime occurred, he threatened to track her 
down and molest her again. 
</P>
<P>
 Several top family law experts as well as area social workers who counsel 
victims of sexual assault deplored the courtroom confrontation because of its 
potential effect on the victims, but conceded there were few options because of 
a defendant's right to function as his own lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very disturbing," said Patricia Phillips, a Los Angeles family 
attorney. "I would think it could be very intimidating for the victims to come 
forward and tell their story with the accuser standing there asking the 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of three victims in the case testified Monday that nurse's aide Victor 
Sumner fondled them while they were patients at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, a developmentally disabled 32-year-old, sternly reproached Sumner 
during his cross-examination when he asked why she had not leaned over and 
pushed him away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here about you," she said. "You're a mean man to ever do that to a girl 
who is in the hospital. Since you've done that I've been scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Sumner why she was scared, the woman, described in court as being 
epileptic and having the mental capacity of an 8- to 10-year-old, responded: 
"Because you said you were going to take down your pants and make me have a 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 After the testimony was finished, the woman's mother said she was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were holding our breath through the whole thing," she said. "We thought 
she might have a seizure because of the fear of facing him again. But actually, 
I think she may have found it cathartic to get her anger out." 
</P>
<P>
 The second woman, a 72-year-old who was so frail that she had to be wheeled 
into court on a hospital bed, also stood her ground during the examination from 
Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner quizzed her on her ability to remember the incident, and the woman 
responded by recounting the event in great detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to put this out of my mind," the woman said. "But I cannot forget 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts who specialize in counseling sexual assault victims said Monday that 
facing the alleged assailant a second time may have been very traumatic for the 
women, even if they showed little emotion on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard enough to go through the trauma of an assault. I can't imagine how 
horrible it must be for them to face the perpetrator a second time," said Pam 
Cady, a counselor with the Ventura County Coalition Against Family and Sexual 
Violence. "They will most likely be hurt by this." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these risks, legal experts said Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Charles W. Campbell Jr. had little choice but to let Sumner represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any way around it," said Los Angeles attorney Gloria 
Allred. "He has the right to represent himself. But still, I think it raises 
serious questions because of the intimidation the victims may feel about coming 
forward to testify." 
</P>
<P>
 Allred said that in her experience, victims of sexual assault find any 
confrontation with their assailants emotionally trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "For women to know that they could be forced to have to answer questions from 
the defendant in court could have a serious chilling effect, preventing them 
from coming forward," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial originally was set for the Ventura County Hall of Justice in 
Ventura, but was ordered moved to the Simi Valley Courthouse last month because 
of the frail condition of two of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 During arguments last week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig tried to 
persuade Judge Campbell to at least prevent Sumner from gaining access to 
victims' phone numbers and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell said Sumner, as the person in charge of the case, had the right 
to all pertinent information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Peter Arenella said granting Sumner such access to his 
alleged victims is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally when people represent themselves in crimes of violence, it's not 
typical that (they) would be given access to the addresses and phone numbers of 
victims," Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 As to Campbell's decision to allow Sumner to represent himself, legal experts 
said the law was quite clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant has a constitutional right to 
represent themselves, which includes confronting your accusers," Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean it is a smart legal tactic, Arenella added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major risk of representing yourself is that you have a fool for your 
lawyer," he said.

 As tears flowed down the face of Kellie O'Sullivan's mother, a Ventura County 
evidence technician Monday showed a jury the bullet-torn smock and T-shirt the 
Westlake nurse was wearing the day she was shot three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharlene Cunningham, the nurse's mother, calmly wiped the tears away and 
turned to a pair of reporters near the front row of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was white," she said of the brown T-shirt held up for everyone to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Stone of the Sheriff's Department donned rubber gloves before sticking 
his hand into a paper bag and pulling out the two articles of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the jury that the items were discolored from being exposed to the 
elements during the 12 days it took authorities to recover O'Sullivan's body 
after her disappearance Sept. 14, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone testified that he collected the T-shirt and the smock from the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office on Sept. 27, 1993, a day after O'Sullivan's 
body was discovered in the 3100 block of Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 He examined the clothes while they were still on her body, both at the crime 
scene and the coroner's office, Stone told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence technician also said that he was present when a pathologist 
removed three bullets from the 33-year-old nurse's chest and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the shots were fired by Mark Scott Thornton, the 20-year-old 
Thousand Oaks man on trial for murder, kidnaping and robbery in connection with 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, who shed some tears last week when a picture of O'Sullivan's body 
was shown to the jury, sat calmly at the defense table Monday without 
expressing much emotion. If convicted of first-degree murder under a special 
circumstance, the young defendant could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Further establishing their case as the third week of the trial began Monday, 
prosecutors also called to the witness stand the man from whom Thornton 
allegedly stole the .38-caliber revolver used to shoot the nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks before O'Sullivan was kidnaped and murdered, someone broke into 
Robert D. Wade's motor home on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. Among the numerous 
items stolen was the gun used to kill the nurse, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the break-in, Thornton lived at an Econo Lodge motel directly 
across the street from Wade's property, according to court testimony. 
Thornton's best friend has testified that he and Thornton broke into the motor 
home, and that Thornton stole the gun, some bullets, a television and other 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested in Reno on suspicion of kidnaping his girlfriend and 
shooting at her mother, Thornton was in possession of both O'Sullivan's stolen 
truck and Wade's pistol, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing at Thornton, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley asked Wade if the 
defendant had permission to enter his motor home and take his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he did not," Wade answered, staring at the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an acquaintance of Thornton's testified that one of their 
favorite spots was a "party site" in the Santa Monica Mountains, about three 
miles from where members of a search team discovered O'Sullivan's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Rex, who did not give his age but appeared to be in his early 20s, said 
that he and up to two dozen friends -- including the defendant -- would party 
at the mountain location. His testimony was designed to show that Thornton was 
familiar with the area, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go up there, anywhere from 15 to 25 people," Rex said. "We'd drink beer 
and socialize." 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the area off Little Sycamore Canyon, the revelers passed within 7/10 
of a mile of where the body was found on Mulholland Drive, testified Richard C. 
Haas, the district attorney's investigator on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex said his group liked to go to the area because the youths could make a lot 
of noise and not be detected.

COURT TO HEAR MERCHANTS' ARGUMENTS FOR POLE SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of business owners who sued the city of Agoura Hills to keep their 
outlawed pole-mounted signs standing will have their day in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled at 9 a.m. in Van Nuys Superior Court, said Robert Aran, 
one of the attorneys representing the 12 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Aran said that under California's Business and Professions Code, the business 
owners have the right to keep their tall signs because they draw customers from 
the freeway. They would lose that business if the signs were dismantled, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These particular businesses are locationally disadvantaged, and they cannot 
continue to communicate with the public if they comply with the applicable city 
law," said Aran.  
</P>
<P>
 The city banned pole signs in 1985. In a referendum later that year, voters 
supported the ban 3 to 1. A city initiative that would have overturned the pole 
sign ordinance lost overwhelmingly last November. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs were to have been removed by March, 1992, but several businesses 
refused and began filing lawsuits earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has created hard feelings between opponents of freeway signs, who 
say they spoil the scenery, and many of the business owners who have them. The 
opponents have tried to organize boycotts against the businesses that filed the 
suits, but apparently have met with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills City Atty. Greg Stepanicich could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Aran, the city argues that the state code deals with height and 
size restrictions. Therefore, he said, the state code does not apply in this 
case, because the city wants to remove the signs altogether, not regulate their 
size or height. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their position is illogical and renders the state's expressed policy 
meaningless," Aran said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms are Chevron, Unocal, Burger King, Texaco, Lumber City, Fence 
Factory, Roadside Lumber and Hardware, McDonald's, Denny's, Jack In The Box, 
Horse Trailers International and a Mobil service station. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Denis Weber said the ordinance is "a local-control issue" that 
has the support of most residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to take a stand that they all need to come down, and this is 
just the first step as far as I'm concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been heating up in other cities as well. In Calabasas, the 
Planning Commission recently ordered Calabasas Mobil and Red Robin restaurant 
to remove their pole signs within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs violate a city ordinance prohibiting signs taller than 60 feet, the 
commission ruled. The two were invited to apply for permits for 42-foot signs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in May, Agoura Hills officials announced an agreement with Shell Oil 
Co. in which the company would take down a 70-foot pole sign in exchange for 
permits to build a carwash and mini-mart.

DONALD MEADOWS, ORANGE COUNTY HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR, DIES AT 97 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HSU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald C. Meadows, scientist, journalist, teacher and Orange County historian, 
has died at age 97. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows, who lived in Orange County 82 years, authored or co-authored seven 
books, including "Historic Place Names of Orange County," which lists more than 
650 place names and their origins. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had so many different interests," said his son, Donald Frances Meadows, a 
retired professor of English and German at Yuba Community College in Yuba City, 
where Meadows moved in 1985 to be close to his son. "He belonged to almost 
every historical society in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows' interest in history began with a 1905 visit to Mission San Juan 
Capistrano. Friends at the mission allowed him access to mission records and 
the Mission and Rancho periods of Orange County became his specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows was a reporter for newspapers in San Pedro and Long Beach. Then, from 
1936 to 1941, he taught California history in the Long Beach Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows' wide interests also took him into other fields. He worked as an 
entomologist for the California Department of Agriculture and as a naturalist 
in several state parks.  
</P>
<P>
 Meadows was one of the founders of the Friends of the UC Irvine Library and in 
1972 sold a widely sought-after collection of 4,000 books, pamphlets, brochures 
and railroad timetables to the library.  
</P>
<P>
 Longtime friend and fellow historian Jim Sleeper said Meadows "was extremely 
generous in sharing his material (on Orange County history) and was certainly 
my mentor." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Shoals, Ind., Meadows was 6 years old when his family settled in 
Orange, where he lived until he and his wife Frances moved to Tustin in 1957.  
</P>
<P>
 Meadows is survived by his son, two grandchildren and three 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 He died at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a sad passing," Sleeper said. "He is best commemorated by what he 
wrote and his influence on the younger generation of historians. My personal 
loss is of a very close friend who shared many hours of good conversation and 
good-natured kidding."

LONG TIME COMING; UCLA RUNNING BACK SHARMON SHAH FINALLY FINDS SUCCESS, 
SATISFACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl watch on his left wrist and the ring on his right hand are 
reminders of what was: UCLA success, personal despair. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,000-yard season is testimony to what is: personal success in a season of 
UCLA frustration. In between, Sharmon Shah embarked on a search for truth and 
learned that the longer he looked, the more he understood he had had it all 
along. What he needed was time to look back and some trials to understand it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 His knees gave him both. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shah followed right guard Chad Sauter through the Arizona State defense 
Saturday night, gaining 26 yards to put him at 1,016 for the season, he 
verified the faith that some had in him, that he had in himself, but that some 
had lost. 
</P>
<P>
 When, later in the third quarter, he swept left end, cut back and scored on a 
65-yard run, he punctuated a season that has one more game to go. Yes, he can 
break a big play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes a big play like that is like a team getting a win," said Coach 
Terry Donahue. "Sometimes it takes so long, it comes so hard, but when you get 
one, you get more. I think he'll feel good about that. It will make his 
1,000-yard performance this year . . . a nicer accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season was going to be Shah's. He was a sophomore with loads of 
potential. Then he injured a knee while working out before fall practice. 
Arthroscopic surgery set him back. Then another injury, to the other knee, set 
him back more. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran 40 times for 187 yards against Stanford in the third game, dropped to 
four times for 17 yards against San Diego State, then dropped to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 His season was finished because the knees wouldn't let him play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got hurt, I tried to find myself," he said. "I've always been a 
truth-seeker. Although I was brought up in Islam, my dad never forced it on me 
and I really didn't know too much about it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But last year, it was time to know. I tried to read about Christianity and 
different faiths and started to wonder, 'What if I find out that another faith 
is right for me?' My dad would be disappointed, but I have to do what's best 
for me. And then I found Islam." 
</P>
<P>
 He also found time for Sharmon Jr., his son, now 2, fathered when he was a 
17-year-old senior at Dorsey High. He found time for school, which had always 
taken a back seat to football. And he found time for knee rehabilitation. 
Because football had gotten him where he was, he needed football to get where 
he wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent much of the summer in Long Beach working with Poly High Coach Don 
Norford, joining Ram defensive back Marquez Pope and others in a program that 
has turned out first-round NFL draft picks Willie McGinist, Leonard Russell and 
Mark Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Norford is a taskmaster, making pupils come and get him in the morning if they 
want to work. "I got an assessment of what he was trying to do," Norford said. 
"That helped me prepare a program for him." 
</P>
<P>
 It involved short, intense workouts. "It's all quickness, balance, vision," 
Shah said. "A lot of things I thought you had naturally, I learned you don't 
have when I worked out with this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Norford, "Sharmon wanted to be perfect, and I can see he is bothered when 
he isn't. I watched him on the 65-yard run Saturday night on television, and I 
saw him do all of the things he was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At last, satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something inside of me that knows I got the best out of a run," Shah 
said. "When you get the most out of your opportunities, make the right 
decisions, the right cuts, that makes for a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 Shah is learning that mental preparation turns out 26-yard runs, occasionally 
even 65-yard touchdown runs. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes back to Norford and to August, when Shah's faith was on trial again. 
He talked a good game, of learning what his body could take so that it was 
ready to give 100% when required. But actions did not follow the words. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked too hard, and his knee hurt less than a week into practice. Surgery 
was mentioned again. Doctors were curious as to why he was limping. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had learned my lesson last year," he said. "I had stayed strong. I had 
gotten with my books. I had done everything I was supposed to do . . . but I 
was wondering what else should I have done? I do all these things and I'm in 
the same situation and they tell me I need a 'scope. So I listened to people I 
trust and believe in and they told me to stay strong, to not get an operation 
and continue to pray and here I am now." 
</P>
<P>
 The person he trusts most is Naim Shah, his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known the physical part of life for a long time," Sharmon said. 'My dad 
taught me that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got hurt, all the physical went out the window. I had to learn the 
mental part of football. My whole game was predicated on running up and down 
the field so I could get confident. Now I had to learn a new way to get 
confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Shah found it and his body responded. It has healed enough to take the 
pounding that comes from carrying the ball 185 times. His mind has matured 
enough to get 180 yards on the last 14 of those carries, 65 yards on the final 
try against Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 And now a game remains, with archrival USC and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, 
his teammate when they were at Dorsey, in the midst of the turf disputes 
between the gangs. Shah avoided allegiance to any gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pop's belt kept me straight," he said. "I had my share of problems, but I 
think everybody has a story that's written before they were even born. I was 
just acting out my story. I was protected in so many ways." 
</P>
<P>
 So Shah was able to concentrate on football, even when football wasn't always 
going right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Donahue says that a crisis situation won't make or break you, but it 
will reveal you for what you are," Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his case, it revealed a 1,000-yard runner at peace with himself. At last.

MCNALL AGREES TO PLEAD TO FRAUD CHARGES; KINGS: PROSECUTORS SAY HE DEFRAUDED 
BANKS FOR MORE THAN $236 MILLION. GRETZKY ALSO ALLEGEDLY WAS DECEIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King President Bruce McNall was formally charged Monday with defrauding six 
banks of more than $236 million over 10 years in a long-awaited plea agreement 
with federal prosecutors, the culmination of a dizzying collapse that is 
virtually unprecedented in the sports business. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-count criminal information consists of two counts of bank fraud, one 
count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud. In December, McNall plans to 
formally plead guilty to all counts, according to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, which stem from a nine-month investigation, also allege for the 
first time that McNall and his executives in one deal took advantage of King 
superstar Wayne Gretzky, his longtime friend and investment partner. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the charges, McNall improperly pledged their horse, Honor Grades, 
to Union Bank as collateral for an $850,000 loan without telling Gretzky, 
representing to the bank that the horse was 100% owned by McNall's Summa 
Stables. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky, who bought 25% of the horse in 1991, isn't mentioned by name in the 
papers and is referred to only as "an investor." Sources confirmed, however, 
that it is Gretzky. McNall lawyer Tom Pollack contended that any such action 
"was done by lower-level employees" without McNall's knowledge. Neither Gretzky 
nor his agent returned phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, The Times reported that McNall was the subject of a federal bank 
fraud investigation, and in August reported that he had struck a plea agreement 
with prosecutors. On Monday, Pollack publicly acknowledged that his client will 
plead guilty to the felony charges, most likely next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce is saying he did wrong, and he is taking responsibility," Pollack said. 
Pollack further said that the false loan applications were part of a larger 
effort to keep McNall's business afloat while trying to put together new 
ventures -- such as a new sports arena -- that would generate money to pay off 
McNall's debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Asst. U.S. Atty. Peter S. Spivack called McNall "the primary motivator and 
beneficiary of this scheme" to defraud the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't called McNall Sports and Entertainment for nothing. The company was 
the man and vice-versa," said Spivack, who said that "a 10-year period without 
discovery is pretty extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, McNall faces a maximum of 45 years in prison. Realistically, 
under federal sentencing rules, McNall is said to currently face nine years in 
prison, with the possibility that the amount could be chipped away for 
extensive cooperation with prosecutors and depending on how a judge views the 
seriousness of the case. Sources close to McNall say he is hoping to whittle 
the term down to five years or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three months, prosecutors and McNall lawyers have hammered out 
the terms and wording of the charges made public Monday, which portray a 
systematic effort dating back to 1984 by McNall and his associates to defraud 
bankers, many of whom were enamored with McNall's glitzy image and who eagerly 
lined up to lend him money. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges largely involve providing phony documents that overstated McNall's 
assets and understated or failed to list his debts. In one case, replicas of 
famous sports jerseys were bought and continually washed to appear authentic so 
bankers would believe that their loans were backed by valuable sports 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that McNall's loan schemes started with a $35-million 
request from European American Bank and the Dutch unit of the giant French bank 
Credit Lyonnais. The loan was made on behalf of Gladden Entertainment, a movie 
production firm McNall owned with longtime Hollywood figure David Begelman. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, the charges say, submitted phony financial statements that overstated 
his net worth in personally guaranteeing the loan. The loan amount was later 
boosted to $50 million in 1985, and to $60 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the charges show McNall falsified loan documents as early as 
1984, sources say, poses a problem for McNall's camp, which has been suggesting 
that the loan schemes were triggered in part out of desperation following a 
near financial collapse in 1987 caused by problems at Gladden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the case said that a 10-year pattern of conduct -- 
especially the overt way some documents were faked -- does not bode well for 
that argument, making it difficult to argue that financial duress provoked the 
actions. Federal authorities are said to have been shocked at how blatant the 
fraud has been in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks McNall is charged with defrauding are Bank of America, European 
American Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Bank of California, First Los Angeles Bank and 
Union Bank. In addition, he is charged with diverting about $13 million from a 
coin partnership he organized with Merrill Lynch and $7 million from King 
ticket sales when his bank funds dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges accuse McNall and his executives of creating sham companies to 
obtain loans, such as a $14-million loan from Credit Lyonnais secured by $15 
million in coins that never existed. It also accused McNall and his executives 
of bribing bank officials to win their favor, including making a $50,000 loan 
to a Bank of America officer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more elaborate schemes involved McNall and his associates arranging 
a $20-million personal loan from Bank of America, using as collateral phony 
financial statements listing $15 million in rare coins, which again did not 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the bank and other institutions from discovering that the coins did 
not exist, the charges say, McNall and his executives maintained that the coins 
had been traded for sports memorabilia. As it turns out, McNall didn't own the 
memorabilia, but instead held it on consignment from memorabilia dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 After he returned the memorabilia to the dealers, the charges say, McNall and 
his executives duped the banks by purchasing sports items and making them look 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's sudden change of fortune would be staggering for any business 
executive, much less one who only a year ago was considered one of the most 
progressive owners in sports. By luring such stars as Gretzky to his Kings, 
McNall did what skeptics once thought impossible: sell out hockey games in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But the road that led McNall from president of the Arcadia High School coin 
club to the national spotlight took a detour when it became clear that much of 
his business empire was built on sand. McNall filed for personal bankruptcy in 
May, shortly after selling 72% of the team to Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen 
to rid himself of his Bank of America loans. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall was expected as early as today to give up his high-profile title of 
president of the Kings, although he will continue to work for the team and draw 
a six-figure salary through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said: "McNall hasn't (resigned) but I know he intends to. I consider 
Bruce a friend. I want to be supportive. My first priority is to the L.A. Kings 
and our fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack said that McNall first became aware of the bank fraud investigation on 
April 20, when subpoenas were served and then he began cooperating with 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying he does not want to downplay McNall's role in the schemes, 
Pollack said that the crimes were "institutional" in nature, involving a large 
number of employees in McNall's organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Spivack said: "The fact that Mr. McNall entered into a plea 
agreement means he's recognized these other people did not conspire to make him 
rich. It was something he was part of." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack said the false loan applications stemmed in part from the financial 
crisis in 1987 at Gladden, exacerbated by pressure from Credit Lyonnais to 
accept an unfavorable foreign distribution deal for its movies. Pollack further 
maintained that McNall was even advised to sue the bank for lender liability 
for its actions, but did not. 
</P>
<P>
 A Credit Lyonnais spokesman, Fred Spar, called Pollack's assertions 
"preposterous" and a "victimization" ploy, noting that McNall continued to do 
business with the bank for years after he purportedly wanted to sue. He also 
noted that the charges date back to 1984, three years before the Gladden 
problems. SOME OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES AGAINST BRUCE McNALL: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank of America: Created false financial statements that showed McNall owned 
a $15 million coin inventory that didn't exist. Stated the inventory was traded 
for a sports memorabilia collection he didn't own, and created counterfeit 
memorabilia he represented as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 * Union Bank: Listed $41 million in horses for his Summa Stables that he no 
longer owned, never fully owned or were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank of California: Applied for a $5 million loan for Superior Stamp and 
Coin to acquire coins and created phony invoices. Duped bank auditors by 
labeling coins not owned by Superior with labels that said they were part of 
the company's inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 * European American Bank: Obtained $25 million in loan proceeds under false 
pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Los Angeles Bank: Submitted false tax returns and financial statements 
inflating his assets and income. 
</P>
<P>
 * Credit Lyonnais: Created a sham company called U.S. Coin Enterprises and 
stated it owned a $15 million coin inventory. Forged a promotional and 
marketing agreement to convince the bank that proceeds from coin sales were 
invested in a sunken treasure salvage operation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch and the Kings: Diverted more than $13 million from a coin fund 
organized with the securities firm and $7 million from King ticket proceeds 
when bank funds dried up.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE HITS THE ROAD AGAIN BUT IN A NEW DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One December dawn long ago, an icy storm turned a lonesome stretch of central 
Illinois highway as slick as a rink. En route to a small town called Pontiac, 
my poor little Pontiac Firebird skidded and spun on the ice like Bambi, but I 
lurched from a ditch back onto the road because there was a high school 
basketball Christmas tournament that I was dying to see, even if I nearly died 
getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 The bleachers were all but empty. A kid from Bloomington touted to be a Pistol 
Pete Maravich-like dribbler and passer was scheduled to be playing in the 
tournament's first game, and college scouts aplenty were expected to pay their 
respects. But because the tip-off was at 9:30 a.m., and because the weather 
outside was frightful, only one coach was evident when I arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was George Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 We had been introduced once or twice, because whenever or wherever a blue-chip 
prospect was to be found, so was George. I spotted him from Chicago to 
Kankakee, from Grand Rapids to Gary. He was a bird dog, to borrow some 
baseball-scout lingo. He scoured the bushes for talent, be they inner-city 
bushes or boondock bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 It surprised me not one bit when Raveling proceeded to run big-time college 
programs at Washington State and Iowa and USC, since his love of scholastic 
basketball was as obvious to me as his knowledge. No matter if he ever gained 
fame as a strategist or innovator, the likelihood that anyone would out-recruit 
him, or be more devoted to a pupil, was tremendously slim. He loved kids and 
helped make them men. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that he is bailing from active coaching comes as no great shock. 
Raveling has been having a midterm crisis for a couple of seasons now, dating 
back at least as far as his consideration whether or not to head the National 
Assn. of Basketball Coaches a couple of years back. The road gets long and 
tiresome after so many winters, even when it isn't slippery. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it took a literal crossroads in George's life to bring him to Monday's 
announcement. The accordion that was once his Jeep, crumpled and cracked from a 
two-car crash, could very well have been the driver. And while a man should 
feel lucky to escape such debris with his life, the fact that one-third of the 
bones in your body are broken or bent tends to give one pause. For Raveling, it 
is time to pause. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt he remembers that Pontiac morning of our distant past. Perhaps he 
even remembers one Bob Bender flipping fabulous no-look passes, not to mention 
scoring 50 points, as a senior who eventually would appear in Final Fours for 
not one but two schools, Indiana and Duke, before becoming a successful NCAA 
coach himself. 
</P>
<P>
 More likely, though, George remembers it because he remembers everything. The 
man has a remarkable capacity for names, faces and dates. He is a raconteur 
with a million stories, including an anecdote or two from this summer's 
Goodwill Games in Russia that I haven't even gotten a chance to hear. Knowing 
George, he probably recruited some point guard from St. Petersburg Orthodox 
High, or Kiev Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor guy went halfway around the globe safely, then got undone on his own 
city's streets. By the time he was sprung from hospitalization, his face looked 
gaunt and his waist was missing maybe 50 pounds. George, of course, joked that 
he hoped he could stick to this radical new diet. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't say that I can match him story for story when it comes to his career. 
Ninety-nine percent of the nail-biting games played in Pullman, Wash., or in 
Iowa City, Iowa, I am afraid, went unseen by me. What I do know is that this 
city slicker must have had a what-am-I-doing-here moment or two near that Idaho 
border or in those Hawkeye cornfields. But that never stopped him from giving 
them his best. 
</P>
<P>
 Images, I do have. One is of George jumping around on the sideline as though 
he had just sprung from a jack-in-the-box. Raveling's arms and legs got more of 
a workout than Richard Simmons'. He did more semaphore than most sailors. John 
Thompson carried a towel, Jerry Tarkanian chewed on one, but after a game, only 
Raveling needed one. 
</P>
<P>
 The one expression I wish I could change is the one on George's face a few 
years ago after an NCAA tournament game, when some lucky stiff from the 
opposition eliminated USC with a shot that would have made a Globetrotter 
proud. For Raveling, that could have been the right time and right team. His 
own outside shot at coaching a championship club, after all, was getting longer 
and longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is time for Raveling to cut down his traveling. Wherever basketball is 
played, however, be looking for him to turn up.

RAVELING DECIDES HE CAN'T GO ON AS USC'S COACH; BASKETBALL: CHARLIE PARKER 
TAKES OVER ON INTERIM BASIS AFTER HIS BOSS QUITS BECAUSE OF NEAR-FATAL CAR 
ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC basketball Coach George Raveling announced his retirement Monday, citing 
injuries he suffered in a near-fatal auto accident Sept. 25. Charlie Parker, 
one of his assistants, was named interim coach for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that remaining on as head basketball coach, while not 
fulfilling my professional responsibilities, would be fair to the university, 
the student body, my coaching staff and the players," Raveling said in a 
statement read at a news conference by his attorney a week after Raveling's 
release from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although my health is improving, my present physical state does not allow me 
to work the sidelines in my accustomed manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, suffered nine broken ribs, a broken collarbone and pelvis, and a 
collapsed lung in the accident. He spent nearly seven weeks in the hospital, 
including 10 days in intensive care, and was expected to sit out at least six 
more weeks. The Trojans will open their season Wednesday night at the Sports 
Arena against New Mexico State in the Preseason National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I have previously stated, it has been my intention to conclude my college 
coaching career at the University of Southern California," said Raveling, who 
did not attend the news conference and had his attorney, Jerry Roth, read the 
statement. "The present state of my physical condition has brought me to this 
point sooner than I had expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Parker, who has coached with Raveling for the last seven seasons, "Coach 
Raveling was the program. He established a program that now deserves a lot of 
respect across the nation. When people talk about USC basketball, they talk 
about George Raveling. And, when they talk about George Raveling, they talk 
about USC basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker and another assistant, Jack Fertig, have been coaching the team in 
Raveling's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Mike Garrett said Raveling began to consider retirement 
nearly two weeks ago. Since then, Raveling and USC have worked on an agreement 
for the school to buy out the final two years of his five-year contract. Terms 
of the buyout were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Raveling will be missed," Garrett said. "He is a very recognizable 
person who has made USC's basketball program very visible and very competitive. 
But what may be most important is, like many people have said before, he's an 
educator." 
</P>
<P>
 When Raveling was released from USC University Hospital last Tuesday, he told 
friends that he was 95% sure that he would not return to coaching. It was not 
until Monday morning, however, that he told his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first saw him in our meeting room (after the team's customary 6 a.m. 
practice), I thought that he had come to give us an inspirational speech for 
our first game," junior guard Burt Harris said. "Then when I heard the word 
retire, I knew it was serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Players said they all cried after Raveling told them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hurt and shocked when I first heard him say that he was retiring," 
senior forward Lorenzo Orr said. "I mean, I still can't come up with the words 
about my feelings inside. Coach Rav meant so much to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Stais Boseman said: "I was real sad when I first knew about 
it. I know it's kind of selfish, but the whole team wants him . . . we need 
him. But, we also know that he has to take care of his health and that's more 
important for him right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling's retirement also surprised one of his colleagues, Jim Harrick of 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little surprised but he had a very, very close call and I'm sure it was 
tremendously traumatic for him," Harrick said. "When I first heard about it 
this morning, I thought he'd only (step aside) for one year. But George 
Raveling is a man of many, many talents. He will always find something he can 
do successfully." 
</P>
<P>
 In his eight seasons at USC, Raveling had a 115-118 record but he was 26-62 in 
his first three seasons during the Trojans' rebuilding stage. Over the last 
four seasons, USC had a 77-40 record, and four consecutive postseason 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991-92, Raveling coached the Trojans to a school-record 24 victories, an 
NCAA tournament bid and a No. 8 ranking in the final Associated Press poll. For 
his efforts that season, Raveling was named the 1992 national coach of the year 
by several organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 22-year college coaching career, Raveling became one of only a few 
coaches to have taken three schools to the NCAA tournament. He coached at 
Washington State from 1972 to 1983, compiling a 167-136 record. At Iowa, where 
he coached from 1983 to 1986, he had a 54-38 mark. His overall record is 
336-292, with six NCAA tournament appearances and two National Invitation 
Tournament bids. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to remain involved with other basketball organizations, among them

JIM MURRAY: FIRST IN LINE FOR RAIDER HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who has the best pass-completion record on the Raiders, would you guess? Jeff 
Hostetler? Not even close. Daryle Lamonica? Jim Plunkett? Ken Stabler? Nah. In 
a sense, they were receivers.  
</P>
<P>
 The most proficient passer in Raider history -- in terms of numbers, not 
yardage -- might be a guy you never heard of. It might be Jim Otto, "Old 
Double-Oh," his teammates called him, but as far as the public at large was 
concerned, that might as well have been double zero. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been Double D. That would be Dave Dalby. Jim Otto played in 210 
consecutive games, D.D. in 205.  
</P>
<P>
 Or, it just might be Don Mosebar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" you ask.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, look at it this way: The Raiders have had, probably, 20 quarterbacks in 
their history. They've had twice as many running backs and even more wide 
receivers.  
</P>
<P>
 They have had three centers -- Otto, Dalby and now Mosebar. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarterback might get to handle the ball 70 times on a good day. He can 
throw a few incompletions. A center has 70 too. He cannot afford an 
incompletion.  
</P>
<P>
 He is like the catcher in baseball. The game begins and continues through him. 
He cannot make a mistake, miss a signal, bobble a ball, miss a block. But, even 
more than a catcher in baseball, the center is overlooked. Like a lot of 
offensive linemen, his neighbors probably think he spies for a living. Or he's 
a drug lord.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mosebar has not only played in 170 games for the Raiders, he has started 
every one since 1989, 87 consecutive games.  
</P>
<P>
 Good centers last a long time in this game for the same reason diamond cutters 
do. As precision craftsmen, they're in short supply.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, their main contribution at the start is the four-inch pass. But 
this is to be delivered with about one ton of malevolent nose guards and 
linebackers standing over their heads and salivating at the prospect of 
grinding them into the ground once the ball has been delivered.  
</P>
<P>
 In the old days of the legal head slap, you could always tell the center. He 
was the one with the wound on the bridge of his nose, often open and bleeding, 
where the opposing lineman had slammed his helmet down on the protruding bump.  
</P>
<P>
 Like every other offensive lineman, the center's job is to keep this mass of 
hostile muscle off the quarterback and out of the backfield. His job, though, 
is a little more complicated because he has to do something else first, snap 
the ball. And you don't protect the quarterback by brute strength because 
everybody in that pileup is as big and strong as you. 
</P>
<P>
 You do it by turning a chess game into a blood sport. You do it by shutting 
off lanes to the quarterback. Your biggest nightmare, next to the bobbled 
handoff, is the bobbled quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a highly skilled position," says Mosebar. "Every other position, you 
can take a reckless rush, the risk route. We have to know exactly where to take 
a step, where to put a hand, how to make the play work. You have to rehearse it 
over and over." 
</P>
<P>
 An offensive line is like a chorus line. The individual effort has to result 
in teamwork that makes it appear to be a single entity. One guy out of step and 
the effect -- the play -- is lost. It is a place for the most disciplined 
individuals, Good Soldier Schweiks, not the cavalry officers, kamikaze pilots 
or the urban guerrilla types. 
</P>
<P>
 You obey orders. Your job is to neutralize the high-risk blitzers, the 
charging linebackers, the speedy safeties. You can't get mad. You can't even 
get excited. You are a mechanic.  
</P>
<P>
 It's for sure, you're not a star. Running backs become Galloping Ghosts and 
Four Horsemen. Quarterbacks become Slinging Sams and Golden Boys. Even 
defensive linemen become the Steel Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 You become "Hey, you!" or just "No. 72." You never get the game ball, the 
cover of Sports Illustrated. You don't sell shoes or soft drinks. You just 
stand there and keep the raging linebackers off the guys who do.  
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be fast. You don't have to run the 40 in 4.3. But you have 
to be as quick as a puff adder for those first few yards. You get your position 
down to science. You are the accompanist, not the soloist.  
</P>
<P>
 Don Mosebar, "Mose" to his teammates, is such an integral part of the Raiders, 
it's hard to believe they thought they had made a calamitous mistake when they 
drafted him No. 1 in 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 An imposing physical specimen at 6-feet-6 and 295 pounds, he had been a key 
factor in turning USC into Tailback U. with his aggressive blocking, tearing 
open paths for Charles White and Marcus Allen.  
</P>
<P>
 But, a week before the draft, Mosebar had to undergo back surgery, unbeknown 
to the Raiders. Al Davis needed smelling salts when he found out, but the fact 
is, Don Mosebar was one of the best No. 1 picks in pro football history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played in all the games that year," he said as he sat in a locker room at 
Anaheim the other day after the team's key victory over the Rams. "So how bad 
could it be?" 
</P>
<P>
 He leads the Raider charge and has for nearly 11 seasons now. Of course, the 
first duty of an offensive lineman is not to get noticed. If he gets noticed, 
it's usually because he didn't pick up the blitz or got bowled over by the 
defensive tackle or, worst of all, misread the count and bungled the snap.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, Don Mosebar, ol' Mose, has done a fantastic job. Consider this: Fran 
Tarkenton completed, what, 3,686 passes in his career? Mose is probably working 
on his 12,386th. Without an interception.  
</P>
<P>
 The least they could do is honor him with a nickname. The Secretary of the 
Interior would be nice. He's just as anonymous as the real one. For a guy who 
has out-completed Frantic Francis, that's pretty dedicated.

DISNEY TO ORGANIZE MARATHON; RUNNING: ANAHEIM RACE WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH LOS 
ANGELES MARATHON, ORGANIZERS CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, it was enough to make Bill Burke blanch. Disney was getting 
into the marathon business in Orange County, and that probably meant big money 
-- the kind Burke, president of the Los Angeles Marathon, could not match. 
</P>
<P>
 That could send elite runners, those who put marathons on the running map, to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 So they talked and reached an accord of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the first Disneyland Marathon and 5K run will be announced. The 
Los Angeles Marathon will be represented at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The key with Disney is the 5,000-meter run. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be coupled with the Disneyland Marathon on March 26, 1995, three weeks 
after the Los Angeles Marathon, but the two, said Disney spokesman Joe Aguirre, 
are not in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 More or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in touch with officials of the Los Angeles Marathon and we're 
going to be offering an arrangement whereby people can run both races at a 
reduced price," Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elite runners frequently compete only twice a year, and never so close 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said Monday he had received a letter of agreement to that effect and 
that there was an additional stipulation that Disney would run 5,000-meter and 
10,000-meter races and a half-marathon in 1996, with marathon runners then 
bused to Los Angeles to compete in his race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could give Southern California the biggest running weekend in the world," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's races in 1995 will offer an unusual purse split, with $31,000 going 
to the 5,000-meter field and $19,000 to the marathoners. No appearance money 
for elite runners will be offered, said Aguirre, and the marathon, held to 
promote tourism in conjunction with Disneyland's 40th anniversary, might be a 
one-shot deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter races would be on-going, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Marathon will offer about $500,000 in appearance and prize 
money for its 10th race, March 5, 1995, and Burke said that world-class runners 
Arturo Barrios, Mark Plaatjes, Bob Kempainen, Martin Pitayo and Rolando Vera 
had been contracted to run. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was in contact with Olga Appell, who won in Los Angeles last 
year, to defend her title. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre said Disney had been in contact with runners in Japan and Mexico to 
run in its race, with a special emphasis on the Japanese. The two races will 
limit fields to 10,000 runners, with 1,500 of the spots offered to 
international competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 DisneyWorld, the company's Florida operation, runs its own marathon, on a 
larger scale. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mansoor, with USA Track and Field and the director of the San Francisco 
Marathon, has been contracted to direct the Disney races. The 5,000-meter event 
will be run on Disneyland property, with the marathon course -- which has yet 
to be determined -- winding through the city of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the Disneyland and Los Angeles marathons will be evaluated after 
this year and next, said Burke, and if the marriage is not satisfactory, the 
two entities will go their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Marathon has had Mercedes Benz as its primary sponsor for its 
entire run, but the contract runs out after the 1995 race and Mercedes has 
indicated that it will not renew, Burke said. However, other automobile 
sponsors could become involved.

 On the day he announced his retirement from coaching because of injuries he 
suffered in an auto accident, George Raveling was sued Monday by the driver of 
the other car for allegedly running a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Ziehm filed a personal-injury suit against Raveling, claiming he 
suffered head and neck injuries in the accident Sept. 25. Ziehm, a former 
employee at the USC School of Dentistry, seeks unspecified damages.

NEW COACH EMERGES FROM OUT OF SHADOWS; TROJANS: PARKER BRINGS A RUNNING GAME TO 
USC AFTER SERVING AS RAVELING'S ASSISTANT FOR SEVEN YEARS. 
</P>

 The naming of Charlie Parker as USC's interim coach Monday did not surprise 
followers of the Trojan basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker has worked quietly behind the scenes for seven years under George 
Raveling, who announced his retirement Monday. He has been influential in 
recruiting and developing many of the Trojans' top players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Charlie ever since I came back to USC four years ago," Athletic 
Director Mike Garrett said. "I've always felt that he deserved a chance to 
coach at a major university." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, 45, is a 22-year college veteran who spent six years as coach at Wayne 
State in Detroit. There, he had a 120-56 record and three NCAA Division II 
tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sad about George's announcement, but at the same time I'm very 
excited about the opportunity," said Parker, an Ohio native. "I've lost about 
10 pounds over the last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker and Jack Fertig have been coaching the Trojans in Raveling's absence. 
Raveling was hospitalized after a traffic accident Sept. 25. When practice 
opened a month ago, they thought their role was to get the team through 
preseason drills and nonconference games until Raveling's return before the 
start of Pacific 10 Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan changed Monday. Now Parker is the head man and Fertig his top 
assistant. Another assistant, Adrian Walters, moved into Fertig's former role. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker will lead the Trojans for the 1994-95 campaign with an opportunity to 
be named permanently after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the year, we will sit down and analyze the situation," Garrett 
said. "I just want to see Charlie relax and take control of the ballclub and 
show his expression of basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker will have no time to ease into the job. The Trojans play two nationally 
televised games on ESPN in the early going. On Wednesday night, they will play 
host to New Mexico State, which finished 23-8 last season, in the first round 
of the Preseason NIT. On Nov. 27, USC travels to Memphis, Tenn., to play in the 
inaugural Martin Luther King Classic against Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans will be without two of their top rebounders from last season. Mark 
Boyd is playing professionally in Mexico and Tremayne Anchrum will sit out the 
season while recuperating from a knee injury he suffered two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real important for us to get our kids to play well and have fun with a 
new system," Garrett said. "We want to have our fans enjoy the overall view. 
I'm not asking him to win immediately. I'm asking him to coordinate a good 
offense and defense, to play entertaining basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Before arriving at USC in 1988, Parker gained a reputation as a coach who 
liked a fast-paced team. In 1984, he was named Michigan coach of the year after 
leading Wayne State to a 24-7 record and to the final eight of the Division II 
playoffs. Each of his last five teams there was ranked in the top 20 in 
Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker played basketball under Clipper Coach Bill Fitch on the Bowling Green 
freshman team in 1968 before transferring to Findlay. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Trojans, Parker will coach a running game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see Charlie as an exciting coach who will feature teams that will run it up 
the court," Garrett said. "That was his experience at Wayne State."

RAIDERS HAVE A MESSAGE FOR FANS: LET US DO THE FIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Raider defensive end Anthony Smith was leaving Sunday's game against the 
Rams at Anaheim Stadium, he spotted a departing fan who had been placed in a 
holding cell for unruly behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," Smith said, "if you've got all that energy, why don't you become a 
linebacker for us?" 
</P>
<P>
 That sounded great to the fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right, be at Raider camp for practice tomorrow," Smith told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, when Smith arrived at the Raiders' training headquarters in El 
Segundo Monday, the fan was there, eager to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, he didn't get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Raiders hope is that their more aggressive fans get the message: Do 
the cheering and leave the hitting to us. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 26 fights at Sunday's game, 20 arrests and 55 ejections, four times 
the normal number of arrests and five times the number of ejections for an 
average Ram game. The Raiders won the game, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers say they double security when the Raiders come to town. 
Yet while the Chargers are averaging four ejections and five arrests per home 
game this season, when the Raiders made their annual trip to San Diego's Jack 
Murphy Stadium last season, there were only three arrests and one ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures pale, however, in comparison to the Coliseum, where there have 
been 30 to 150 ejections per Raider game this season and about 10 arrests per 
game, according to Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer than 10 ejections per game at the Coliseum for USC games and 
few arrests. The high this year for a USC game was 25 ejections at the 
California game. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, a fan was beaten into a coma at a Raider game. The situation, says 
Downing, has improved considerably over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because we've been more aggressive," he said. "We've been averting 
problems by spotting the problems before they develop so the rest of the fans 
can have a nice day. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a team that has a real rivalry with the Raiders comes to town (with its 
fans) wearing their jerseys, that's when the bantering back and forth begins." 
</P>
<P>
 There are routinely 200 officers on duty for Raider games, perhaps 150 for USC 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin to do their job two hours before the game when they check arriving 
fans for open containers of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, there are spotters positioned on the roof looking for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have zero tolerance," Downing said. "If they get into trouble, they are 
gone as quick as the blink of an eye." 
</P>
<P>
 That's just how the Raiders want it, executive assistant Al LoCasale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The year we got here, we told (Coliseum officials) that we wanted fan 
comfort," he said. "If that meant additional security, so be it. If that meant 
it appears on our bill, so be it. I think you're talking about a small, 
isolated group." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to shutting off beer sales in the third quarter, officials at the 
Coliseum have switched to smaller cups, forcing fans to make additional trips 
to the concession stands to get the same amount of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 And those selling the beer are especially conscious of customers who might be 
under age or appear to already have had too much to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems aren't lost on the players, most of whom have family and friends 
in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 They were horrified by what happened Sunday and are no happier when there is 
trouble at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bunch of drunks ruin it for everybody," said offensive lineman Steve 
Wisniewski. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fights are ridiculous. They infringe on everybody. If you want to do the 
swearing and all the other distasteful things, do it at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry about my family up there. There's no call for that. Let the players 
do the battling on the field."

FOR RAMS' NEWMAN, IT'S DIFFICULT TO WATCH; PRO FOOTBALL: FREE SAFETY TRIES TO 
TAKE HIS MIND OFF TEAM'S STRUGGLES BY SWITCHING CHANNELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have lost four of their last six games by a combined 16 points, and 
free safety Anthony Newman is taking the frustration of the close losses home 
with him after games. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, a defensive captain, turned his back to the field when the offense was 
playing last season because he couldn't bear to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday night, Newman couldn't even watch the game highlights on television 
after the Rams' 20-17 loss to the Raiders at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with highlights -- or lowlights -- such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Jerome Bettis getting buried by the Raider defensive line, gaining 
a career-low 13 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Starting quarterback Chris Chandler suffering a sprained left ankle in the 
second quarter when Raider defensive tackle Chester McGlockton busted through 
the Rams' revolving-door offensive line and sacked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to turn it off and watch some cartoon or something," Newman said. "I 
watched 'Fantasia' last night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get my mind off it because when you start thinking, 'Oh, we lost by 
three points,' you will drive yourself . . . It's different if you're getting 
beat by 30 or 40 points. But we've lost three games where it could have gone 
either way." 
</P>
<P>
 Three-point losses to the Raiders, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons 
leave the Rams 4-6 and with fading playoff hopes entering Sunday's showdown 
against NFC West rival San Francisco at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Bettis get shut down again? Will Chandler even be able to play? Will the 
struggling offensive line -- playing without injured starters Jackie Slater, 
Bern Brostek and Leo Goeas -- be able to protect Chandler or his backup, Chris 
Miller? 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who set a goal of 2,000 rushing yards this season, failed to gain 100 
yards for the fifth consecutive game and is quickly losing ground in the NFL 
rushing race. He is sixth in the league in rushing with 827 yards in 243 
carries, a 3.4-yard average, and trails league-leader Barry Sanders of the 
Detroit Lions by 492 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rough," Bettis said. "There's not a whole lot of positives. We got beat 
up front, and that's the bottom line. We couldn't find anywhere to run, so we 
had to abort the running game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, considering that our game plan is built around running and 
then we can't run the ball in a critical game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were set on stuffing Bettis, but Chandler exposed the soft 
underbelly of the strategy by throwing deep to Flipper Anderson in the first 
quarter, including a 22-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they sell out and bring everyone up to stop Jerome, you'll get some 
sizable yardage throwing downfield," Chandler said. "They wanted to stop the 
run, but shoot, we'll throw for 100 yards a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we need to throw more to open it up for Jerome." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler was doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 10 of 11 passes for 171 yards and a touchdown before suffering 
the injury.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; YIELDS TUMBLE AS DOLLAR RISES; DOW UP 28.26 
</P>

<P>
 Treasury bond yields dropped sharply Monday, helped by a stronger dollar and 
technical factors a day before the Federal Reserve Board was expected to raise 
short-term interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks, taking a cue from bonds, also staged a rally. The Dow industrial 
average jumped 28.26 points to 3,829.73 in moderate trading, recouping Friday's 
20-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market experienced its biggest rally in two weeks, as buyers stepped 
up. The 30-year Treasury bond yield slumped to 8.07% from 8.15% on Thursday, 
the last day of trading before Friday's Veterans Day observance. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said a surprise rally in the dollar helped boost sentiment in the 
bond market. The dollar surged to 1.544 German marks in New York, up from 1.530 
on Friday and the highest since Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also advanced to 98.31 Japanese yen from 97.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations of another Fed rate increase -- the sixth such increase this year 
-- bolstered the dollar Monday, currency traders said. Analysts have argued 
that higher U.S. interest rates would eventually encourage foreign investors to 
invest in U.S. bonds and money market instruments, thereby strengthening the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports of heavy overseas dollar buying by big investment funds and 
selling of German marks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was further aided by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's comment 
that he was pleased with the recent U.S. intervention to boost the battered 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, traders said buyers emerged partly on the belief that 
today's expected Fed rate boost is already factored into bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the federal funds rate -- the overnight loan rate among banks, which 
the Fed influences -- jumped to 5.75% by Monday's close from 4.75% on Friday, 
suggesting that the market believes the Fed could ratchet rates up a full 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists, however, believe the central bank will raise rates by half a 
point in its campaign to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders warned that Monday's bond buying was driven by "short covering" 
by traders who had previously bet on rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 True investors remain wary of committing to bonds at current yields, many 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we saw any substantial retail (small-investor) selling, this market would 
fall apart in a second," said Ken Sullivan, a trader at First Chicago Capital 
Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, meanwhile, NYSE winners topped losers by about 13 to 10. But 
losers had a small edge in the Nasdaq market, even as technology stocks 
rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said stocks are likely to follow the bond market's lead -- up or down 
-- in the wake of whatever move the Fed makes today. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech issues surged after software companies Powersoft and Sybase announced a 
billion-dollar stock-swap merger. Powersoft rocketed 7 7/8 to 69 1/4, while 
Sybase, the acquirer, lost 2 1/16 to 46 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other tech issues, Computer Sciences jumped 2 1/4 to 47 7/8, Microsoft 
leaped 2 1/4 to 64 1/2, Lotus Development gained 1 1/4 to 39 1/4, Apple zoomed 
1 3/8 to 42 1/2 and Intel was up 1 5/8 to 62 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler led many blue chips higher, up 3 1/8 to 49, after investor Kirk 
Kerkorian threatened a fight to boost the stock's value. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big-name stocks gaining included Kodak, up 1 7/8 to 47 5/8; Philip 
Morris, up 1 to 62 5/8, and Disney, up 1 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index rose 19.4 points to 3,095.3, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index added 10.94 points to 2,089.29. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 
average eased 22.91 points to 19,261.45. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index dropped again, losing 40.35 points to 
2,486.64.

 T-Bill Rates at Three-Year High: The Treasury Department sold $13.6 billion of 
new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.29%, up from 5.25% last 
week. Another $13.6 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an average 
discount rate of 5.72%, up from 5.68%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since it averaged 5.34% on Sept. 3, 1991. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since it averaged 5.76% on June 24, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 5.44% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,866.30, and 5.97% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,710.80. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

NO-OFFENSE STEELERS BEAT THE BILLS; PRO FOOTBALL: PITTSBURGH CORNERBACK ROD 
WOODSON AND KICKER GARY ANDERSON KEY 23-10 VICTORY OVER BUFFALO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Woodson, single-handedly accounting for more scoring the last two weeks 
than Pittsburgh's offense, returned an interception for a touchdown and forced 
a fumble for another to lead the Steelers past the Buffalo Bills, 23-10, Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Anderson, again the only productive member of the Steelers' no-go 
offense, kicked three field goals to move into sixth place on the NFL's 
all-time list with 302 as Pittsburgh won for the second week in a row without 
an offensive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson stepped in front of intended receiver Bill Brooks for a 37-yard 
interception return touchdown -- the third of his career -- to put Pittsburgh 
ahead, 10-0, in the final minute of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, with Buffalo down only a touchdown after Jim Kelly's 19-yard scoring 
pass to Andre Reed, a blitzing Woodson dislodged the ball from Kelly near the 
goal line and defensive end Gerald Williams fell on it for his first touchdown 
in nine NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie defensive tackle Brentson Buckner added to the Bills' growing 
frustration, blocking a 32-yard field goal attempt by Steve Christie later in 
the fourth quarter -- Christie's first miss in 18 attempts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who last week kicked a field goal in overtime after Woodson forced a 
critical fumble in the Steelers' 12-9 victory over Houston, is 7-for-7 the last 
two weeks, 17-for-18 this season and 45-for-48 the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Steelers (7-3) again proved it's possible to win in the NFL without 
much offense -- they've won three of their last four despite scoring only two 
offensive touchdowns -- the Bills (5-5) are in desperate straits well before 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kelly under constant pressure from a Pittsburgh pass rush that leads the 
NFL in sacks, the Bills are .500 in November for the first time since finishing 
7-8 in 1987. They trail Miami (7-3) by two games in the AFC East and must play 
twice more in the next 10 days, against Green Bay and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, sacked six times for 54 yards in losses, was lifted for Frank Reich 
late in the fourth quarter after going 22 for 43 for 212 yards and two 
interceptions. He has only one touchdown pass against Pittsburgh the last two 
years after throwing 11 in his first four career starts against his hometown 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh, trailing Cleveland (8-2) by a game in the AFC Central, couldn't 
mount an offense even with former all-pro running back Barry Foster back from a 
four-week injury layoff, but still remained a perfect 6-0 on Monday night under 
Coach Bill Cowher.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; CHANDLER HOBBLED BY ANKLE SPRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Chandler will remain in the Rams' starting quarterback this 
week, but only if his sprained left ankle allows him to play Sunday at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler sprained his ankle in the second quarter of the Rams' 20-17 loss to 
the Raiders Sunday when defensive tackle Chester McGlockton rolled across it on 
a sack. Chandler, who completed 10 of 11 passes for 171 yards before getting 
hurt, was replaced by Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Monday that Chandler's game status was still uncertain, 
but added, "if he's ready to go, he'll start." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox hopes to have Chandler ready to practice at least by Thursday, but said 
he will give Miller more work in practice this week in case he needs to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be fine but it's just a matter of when," Chandler said. "It doesn't 
stop it from being real frustrating, though. It seems like I've had a lot of 
guys hit me low this year. Even in the New Orleans game, there were three or 
four times when a guy came in and just went low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's on purpose or not, it seems like that they have to lunge at you 
at the last second to somehow let you know they are there, whether it's low or 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened with McGlockton's hit? 
</P>
<P>
 "He was coming off a block, kind of crawling," Chandler said. "He just made a 
jump and came right at my ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "On film, it looked like the knee went. It was close." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler sprained the same ankle in the Rams' 8-5 loss to Atlanta on Oct. 2 
and wasn't ready to play the next week. Chandler said it took about three weeks 
to get the ankle back to full-strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler needed crutches to walk after he sprained his ankle the first time, 
but didn't need them Monday. The ankle was heavily wrapped, and Chandler said 
he can't run on it or twist it without feeling pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said game films showed that officials missed three calls in the Raider 
game: An apparent interception by Darryl Henley that was ruled a drop; a 
trapped ball by Raider receiver Tim Brown in the fourth quarter that was ruled 
a catch; and a non-call on Raider receiver Rocket Ismail, who hit Henley in the 
facemask as he broke open for a 10-yard touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley angrily protested the non-call after Sunday's game, and Knox said 
Monday that a review of game films supported Henley's charge.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was jammed but it wasn't called," Knox said. "We had the interception in 
the end zone that should have come out to the 20-yard line. Darryl definitely 
caught the ball and after he came down, the ball came out. One official ruled 
him down, but the other came over and (ruled incomplete). 
</P>
<P>
 "Same thing with the pass to Brown, you could see it on slow motion. It 
bounced right off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the Rams will compile a video clip of the mistakes and send them to 
the league office, as they do every week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fisher, fired as the Rams' defensive coordinator when Knox took over in 
1992, was named Houston's head coach Monday after the Oilers fired Jack Pardee 
and offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher spent the 1991 season with the Rams under John Robinson and was being 
groomed as a head coach since his days in Philadelphia under Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great for him," said Ram free safety Anthony Newman, who played under 
Fisher. "He's finally made it to the top. He knows the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very aggressive coach. He always wanted his players to be on the 
attack. That's what Buddy has taught for years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox expects right tackle Jackie Slater (torn triceps) and right guard Leo 
Goeas (sore abdomen) to be ready for the San Francisco game. . . . Running back 
Johnny Bailey, who missed the Raider game because of a sore abdomen, is listed 
as doubtful. . . . Center Bern Brostek (broken right leg) is expected to be out 
another two to three weeks. MIKE REILLEY

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; MEN'S EXHIBITION IS CHANCE TO GAUGE SKILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, it's an exhibition game against something called Five Star Sports, a team 
of former college players with a roster that includes no recognizable names, 
according to Irvine Coach Rod Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there will be a certain air of excitement Friday night in the Bren 
Center. Hopefully for the Anteaters, it won't be because the score is close. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a new-look Irvine team and the curiosity level, at least, is up. How 
polished is freshman center Kevin Simmons? Is Raimonds Miglinieks really the 
best passer this side of Magic Johnson? Could Michael Tate stare down Mike 
Tyson? And, of course, will these three guys be enough to turn a 10-20 team 
into a 20-10 team . . . or even a 15-15 team? 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West coaches apparently think so. They picked Irvine -- 4-10 and last 
place in the conference standings last season -- to finish tied for fifth this 
go-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at Irvine's team and I think this is the year they will get it 
together," New Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy said. "They've had a great 
influx of talent and they showed everybody what they could do in the tournament 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenth-seeded Irvine lost to New Mexico State, 70-64, in the tournament title 
game last season. It was much too close of a game for McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters were not only playing better at the end of the season, they were 
playing smarter. Instead of extending and exerting pressure with its defense in 
a league known for its athletes more than its shooters, Irvine was packing it 
in a little, playing zone and making teams shoot over them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trend you'll probably see more of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to learn from what we did well," Baker said, "try to do 
the same good things and don't do the same bad things. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, we're going to try to contain the ball on the dribble. If you can't do 
that, your defense is constantly broken down and the opponent is playing with 
the equivalent of a man advantage. And then if you're extended, your help can't 
get there in time." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker also wants to see continued improvement in defensive rebounding. Irvine 
was out-rebounded last season by an average of more than three per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be a better rebounding team," he said. "We're in the process of 
charting our opponents' first-shot success. I have a feeling we did a pretty 
good job of getting people to miss their first shot, but we didn't do a good 
job of getting the ball and going the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the other team gets an easy put-back, all of sudden they're shooting 50% 
against you." 
</P>
<P>
 Conference opponents shot 49% from the field and 43% from three-point range 
against Irvine last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weird science: Baker is a firm believer in team chemistry and he obviously 
likes the formula he's working with this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're different," he said. "We have some different players. We're coming off 
a little success, and that's different. We have a different outlook. We come 
from a different background. I know I feel different." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Anteaters struggle, it will be a different kind of season for Tate and 
Miglinieks. Their community college teams -- Ventura and Riverside, 
respectively -- were a combined 66-10 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our chances for success will have to do with how we deal with the 
days when we don't do what we usually do well," Baker said. "And how we deal 
with the days after the days things didn't go so well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sign-on: Mater Dei's Clay McKnight and Paul Foster of Moorpark College have 
signed letters of intent with Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight, a 6-foot-2 guard, averaged 14.6 points and shot 54% from the floor 
last season. "Clay is a guard, not just a (point guard) or a (shooting guard), 
but a guard," Baker said. "He plays well with the ball or without the ball and 
he's a terrific shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, a 6-9 forward who led the state in shooting (65.7%), averaged 20 
points and 10 rebounds. "Paul will give us a presence with some size who can 
score," Baker said. "He really understands how to play." Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The women's 400-yard medley relay team of Gwen Yoshizumi, Amerie Nordbert, 
Carrie Rowe and Shelly Wright set an Irvine Crawford Pool record of 4 minutes 
3.14 seconds during last week's loss to Northern Arizona. . . . Basketball 
injury update: Forward Elzie Love (strained calf) and center Dan Augulis 
(dislocated finger) are sidelined and listed as day to day; forwards LaDay 
Smith and Shaun Battle (knee injuries) are going about "half speed," according 
to Coach Rod Baker. "And Michael Tate needs about two weeks off, but he ain't 
going to get it, so he doesn't think about it."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: EARLY SUCCESS STUNS CYPRESS 
BASKETBALL

<P>
 When Cypress started play in the Barstow men's basketball tournament last 
Thursday, first-year Coach Paul Bottiaux had a simple goal -- to play three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 His fear was losing the first two in the double-elimination format. 
</P>
<P>
 He never considered the eventual outcome: winning the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress started the season with only three returning players, including 
starters Matt Kenney and Jeff Cummins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really had no idea what we were going to play like," said Bottiaux, who 
took over for Don Johnson. Johnson, the winningest community college men's 
basketball coach in the history of California, retired last spring. Bottiaux 
was an assistant to Johnson for seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress opened with a 91-69 victory over a team from Miramar Naval Air 
Station, then beat Barstow, 100-65. 
</P>
<P>
 This left Cypress facing Riverside for the championship. Riverside is the 
favorite to win Orange Empire Conference title. Cypress was picked to finish 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress played awkwardly in the first few minutes, but recovered and went on 
to beat the Tigers, 70-68. A three-point attempt by Riverside bounced away as 
time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played really hard," Bottiaux said. "We battled and it just happened to 
come out our way." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummins, who averaged 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists, was the 
tournament's most valuable player. Kenney made 12 of 19 three-pointers in the 
tournament and Cypress made 34 of 75 (45%) as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Gonzales, a freshman guard from Orange High, tied a Cypress single-game 
record for three-pointers with eight in the victory over Barstow. The Chargers 
also got a boost from David Neal, another freshman from Orange. He averaged 
eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 thing about the weekend was that we were able to get away and come 
together as a team," Bottiaux said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Water polo: Golden West and Long Beach, which have played each other the three 
previous Saturdays, are hoping for another meeting Saturday in the State 
tournament title game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's first-round games at Long Beach Belmont Plaza: Diablo Valley plays 
Cuesta at 8 a.m.; Golden West takes on West Valley at 9:15 a.m.; Long Beach 
plays Modesto at 10:30 a.m., and Merced plays Citrus at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The semifinals are at 4:30 and 5:45 p.m. Friday and the title game is Saturday 
at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West comes in with a 27-3 record, with all three losses to Long Beach. 
The Vikings are 23-4, losing three times to Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams split meetings in tournaments during the regular season. Long Beach 
beat Golden West, 13-12, Oct. 28 to win the South Coast Conference 
regular-season title. Golden West came back with an 11-6 victory over the 
Vikings in the South Coast Conference tournament, Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach earned the top berth in the State tournament with an 11-9 victory 
over Golden West Saturday in the Southern California championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bowls and polls: Rancho Santiago (8-1) continued to hold down the top spot in 
the Southland football poll. Long Beach (9-1), which completed its regular 
season, is second. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield (8-1) is third, El Camino (8-1) fourth, L.A. Valley (8-1) fifth, 
Moorpark (7-2) sixth, Cerritos (7-2) seventh, Chaffey (7-2) eighth, College of 
the Desert (7-2) ninth and Palomar (6-3) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago has clinched the Mission Conference Central Division title and 
will go to a bowl game. The question is, where? The Dons will receive an 
invitation to the Simple Green Orange County Bowl. But if Rancho Santiago 
closes out the regular season with a victory over Saddleback Saturday at Santa 
Ana Stadium, the Dons could also draw interest from the Shrine Potato Bowl in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Picked off: Saddleback's Scott Patton, a former football and baseball standout 
at Capistrano Valley High, leads the Mission Conference in interceptions with 
seven. Patton signed a professional baseball contract out of high school but 
was released after spending two seasons in the Chicago White Sox's minor-league 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 His return to football this fall has been most impressive. He has intercepted 
two passes in a game twice including Saturday against Orange Coast. He returned 
the first 29 yards for a touchdown and his second was late in the game and set 
the Gauchos up for a possible score. But the OCC defense held and the Pirates 
won, 23-19. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey, the top-ranked men's basketball team in the state, plays in the 
Fullerton tournament this week. The tournament starts Wednesday with East Los 
Angeles vs. Grossmont at 6 p.m. and Fullerton takes on Los Angeles Harbor at 8 
p.m. In Thursday's games: Saddleback plays Chaffey at 6 p.m. and Long Beach, 
the defending State champion, goes against San Bernardino Valley at 8. The 
tournament continues Friday and the title game is Saturday at 8 p.m. . . . The 
Rancho Santiago Tip-Off tournament starts Friday. Santa Barbara plays Arizona 
Yavapai at 6 p.m. and Rancho Santiago plays El Camino at 8 p.m.

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; 49ERS ADD TO BIG WEST VOLLEYBALL TITLE 
COLLECTION

 Winning four straight of anything is tough enough but try doing it in one of 
the nation's best conferences, playing other perennial national powers and 
facing All-Americans almost every night. Now that's an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's volleyball team achieved its quest to four-peat, winning the Big 
West Conference championship with a 6-15, 15-6, 15-13, 13-15, 15-12 victory 
over Pacific on Saturday night at Stockton. Understandably, Coach Brian 
Gimmillaro is quite pleased -- and a bit surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing in the best volleyball conference in the country and we've been 
real fortunate to win it four times in a row," Gimmillaro said. "From the first 
day (of practice), I didn't believe we were good enough to win it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just amazed how tough these kids are when they need to be. I'm really 
proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (22-4 overall) finished 16-2 in conference play. The defending NCAA 
Division I champions have won 68 of 72 conference matches (94%) since the 
streak began in 1991. All-American outside hitter NichelleBurton and defensive 
specialist Prentice Perkins, seniors, are the only members of each championship 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, ranked sixth in the nation by Volleyball Monthly magazine, join 
Hawaii (1987-90) as the only teams to win four consecutive Big West volleyball 
titles. Long Beach is followed in the final league standings by Hawaii (22-4, 
15-3), Pacific (21-4, 14-3) and UC Santa Barbara (23-6, 12-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach earned the conference's automatic berth in the NCAA tournament, 
which begins Nov. 30. The 49ers have four nonconference matches remaining.

<P>
 "I still would like us to get better," Gimmillaro said, "and we have a few 
more weeks before the playoffs start to still develop." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Top player: Senior middle blocker Traci Dahl is the conference's player of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl was a key in the title-clinching match against Pacific with 22 kills and 
12 blocks. In the deciding fifth game, Dahl scored six of Long Beach's 15 
points with four kills and two blocks. Her match-high 11 block assists are a 
career-high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traci took over the match," Gimmillaro said. "She is one of the top middle 
blockers if not the top one in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dahl: "I just wanted to go out and have a blast my senior year and I am."

<P>
 The injury-plagued team lost its two games in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation Tournament to UC Irvine on Friday, 16-10, and UC Santa Barbara on 
Saturday, 14-4. Stanford defeated USC, 17-7, to win the championship.

 Long Beach, which is 5-18, 0-8 in the MPSF, closes its season at noon Saturday 
at Pepperdine.

<P>
 Back on the court: The women's basketball team lost, 68-66, to 49er alumni 
Saturday at The Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Melissa Gower led Long Beach with 14 points and 15 rebounds. 
Center Cindy Brown paced the alumni team with 16 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with the execution of our offense," 49er Coach Glenn McDonald 
said. "We were being patient. Last year we averaged (about) 25 turnovers a game 
and that started right from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday night we had 15 turnovers. This year I think we'll have more 
opportunities to score because we're being more patient and more selective with 
our passes." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The women's cross-country team finished 13th at the District 8 Championships 
in Tucson, and the men were 15th. Sonya Berro paced the 49er women, finishing 
44th overall. She ran the 5,000-meter course in 19 minutes 6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Bendzick ran the fastest time for the men, finishing in 67th place after 
running the 10,000-meter course in 34:30 seconds. . . . The women's golf team 
finished 15th at the San Diego State Fall Classic, which took place Monday 
through Wednesday. Cindy Rendon was 33rd with a score of 259. Men's basketball 
Coach Seth Greenberg is scheduled to discuss college basketball today on XTRA 
(690-AM) from 2-2:30 p.m. with talk-show host Jim Rome. The men's basketball 
team plays the Mexican National team in an exhibition 7:30 p.m. Friday at the 
San Diego Sports Arena.

 Entering a new league, the Centurions have an uphill climb to their fifth 
consecutive playoff appearance. Nina Alexander returns for her fourth year 
after averaging 14.7 points and 9.7 rebounds and being selected first-team 
All-Pacific Coast League last season. Watts hopes to move her to the off-guard 
position to take advantage of her outside shooting. She is joined by sister 
Addie Alexander, who averaged seven points and was an all-league honorable 
mention selection last year, and Palacios, the only other returning senior 
starter. Joining Addie in the backcourt is Moreno, who is back after suffering 
a knee injury that kept her sidelined all last season. Watts is relying on 
freshman newcomers Martinez and Love to contribute heavily from the outset. 
Both could break into the starting lineup, which would pose problems with 
inexperience early on. Palacios and Griset will help out in the post, which 
Watts expects to be one of the Centurions' biggest weaknesses because of the 
lack of height. SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 Mallett is hoping to return this program to its glory days. The Saxons have 
struggled the past couple years, including two-victory seasons each of the last 
two years. She inherits only three seniors and five returners from last year's 
fifth-place team, which won only one league game. The lack of depth means 
freshmen Colon and Holman will play a lot. Colon is one of the best freshmen in 
the league, and is expected to start from the outset. The Saxons will also 
struggle with rebounding and scoring in the post. Overall team quickness and a 
fast-break style offense should help the Saxons win more than a handful of 
games. Mallett says the team philosophy consists of outlasting opponents by 
being in better condition and compares the team strategy to Arkansas' "Thirty 
minutes of hell." Flores will move to point guard and, along with Hsu, will run 
the show. Joosten and Jackson will provide a majority of the scoring in the 
paint. Experience is definitely a strong point, with three seniors and two 
juniors returning. Mallett says the team's goal is to finish with a .500 
record. A tough summer regimen and a less-than demanding nonleague schedule 
make that possible. SCHEDULE

GIRLS' BASKETBALL '94-'95: EMPIRE LEAGUE; ADAMS IS RETURNING IN THE STARRING 
ROLE; BASKETBALL: AS THE ONLY STARTER BACK FROM CYPRESS' LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP 
TEAM, SHE WILL BE ASKED TO PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON CLIFFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's looking at it as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the new basketball season, Cypress senior forward Julie Adams isn't 
thinking much about all the success she enjoyed last season .  
</P>
<P>
 An Empire League championship, Southern Section semifinal appearance and 
teammates who led the county in scoring and assists made the 1993-94 season an 
enjoyable one for Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, however, Adams finds herself in a much different role. She 
is the only returning starter from last year's team that finished 26-4 after 
losing to San Bernardino by nine points in the Southern Section Division II-A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams was a "complementary" player alongside Jessica Eggleston, the county's 
top scorer and Empire League Player of the Year, and Susan Flaming, the county 
leader in assists average. Adams averaged 17.3 points and was among the county 
leaders in rebounding and field goal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 But graduation sent Eggleston to Cal Poly Pomona and Flaming to Biola, leaving 
Adams to shoulder the rebuilding Centurion program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julie is the only returner with any real experience," Coach John Selbe said. 
"We have six other returners, but few of them saw much playing time last 
season. She's such a competitor that she will thrive on the opportunity and the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said she is ready to accept the role of team leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to the role," she said. "I may be the leading scorer or I may 
not, but I'll look to the open players for a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I have to be the leader in the major categories. If it happens 
to turn out that way, then great." 
</P>
<P>
 Some wondered if Adams would even return for her senior year on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball has never been her priority when it comes to sports. It's softball 
to which she has devoted nearly her entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, she announced she chose to accept a softball scholarship to UCLA 
and said she would not try to play both sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to gut feeling," Adams said. "I've always wanted to go to UCLA 
since I was a little girl. After weighing all the pros and cons, it is going to 
be the best place for me. It was the hardest decision of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Adams said there was no question in her mind that she would return for 
her senior season of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a doubt. I've always loved to play basketball and I don't just 
want to quit because a couple of my teammates have left or its my senior year 
and I've committed to another sport. I want to play," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selbe said he wasn't sure she was going to play until school began in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Softball has always been her priority, so I wasn't sure. She let me know 
sometime at the beginning of the year that she would be back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cypress' gain is the rest of the league's loss. Not just in softball and 
basketball, but in volleyball as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter in softball this season will be Adams' 11th varsity letter, tying her 
with 1987 graduates Elizabeth Crosdale (cross-country, basketball and track) 
and Nicky Luce (volleyball, basketball and softball). 
</P>
<P>
 She has been a four-year starter in basketball and softball, and played the 
last three full seasons of volleyball. She missed a letter her freshman year in 
volleyball when she chose to play on the JV team. However, she was called up to 
provide depth when the Centurions advanced to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the best female athlete I've seen in the 15 years that I've been at 
Cypress," Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Adams: "I've been what you could call a natural athlete all my life. I 
just seem to pick things up faster than a lot of other people do. It's a 
blessing." 1993-94: IN REVIEW

<P>
 League champion Cypress advanced its title run to the semifinals of the 
Southern Section Division II-A playoffs before exiting. After beating defending 
champion El Dorado for the league championship, the Centurions lost, 60-51, to 
a 25-5 San Bernardino team that lost to top-seeded Alemany in the finals. 
Cypress advanced with victories over El Modena, Redondo and Troy. . . . El 
Dorado survived the first round of the Division III-AA playoffs, topping La 
Quinta, 57-39. Unfortunately for the Golden Hawks, Newport Harbor ended their 
season in the next round with a 59-32 blowout. . . . Katella made it into the 
first round of the Division II-A playoffs, losing to eventual champion Alemany, 
58-39. . . . Esperanza lost its Division I-AA wild-card game to Fountain 
Valley, 62-58. . . . Jessica Eggleston was named league Most Valuable Player 
for the second consecutive season and joined teammates Julie Adams and Susan 
Flaming collecting first-team all-league honors. El Dorado was also well 
represented in league honors. Michelle de Bruijn and Shanna Renken were each 
named to the first team and Jamie Nebeker and Jamie Sweet were named to the 
second. Katella had three players on all-league teams. Chris Carillo was named 
to the first team and teammates Stephanie Toon and Deborah Vargas earned 
second-team honors.

 Returning no starters and only three members from last year's fourth-place 
squad won't help the Knights move up in the league race. This team will rely on 
quickness and outside shooting to stay in games. Easterly's second year could 
be as successful as her first if the newcomers can fill the holes left by the 
departure of Cris Carillo and Deborah Vargas, two all-league guards from last 
year's playoff team. The emphasis has shifted from avenging playoff losses to 
staying with the rest of the pack in the new-look league. Easterly will look to 
Germinaro and Morales to provide much-needed leadership and experience. Painter 
will see lots of time in the post. She is one of several sophomores who will be 
asked to play a big role once the league season rolls around. Youth and the 
lack of a distinguished leader will hinder the Knights. Easterly said the team 
has plenty of raw talent that needs to be developed and, with only two seniors, 
it will be a rebuilding year. A third consecutive playoff appearance would be 
nice, but with the least-experienced team in the league, it's not a priority. 
The Knights do have their final three league games at home, which could help.

<P>
 Harrison inherits eight lettermen, including four starters from a team that 
finished third in the Garden Grove League last season. Experience will 
definitely be an asset as the Irish enter the new league. Kitagawa, one of 
three returning seniors, averaged 13.5 points and earned all-league honors. 
Given the lack of depth in the paint, Kitagawa will be relied heavily upon to 
provide an inside game and leadership. Cunningham returns from an honorable 
mention season that saw her average 11.6 points. Gutjahr's fourth year should 
see her producing more than last season's 9.5 points and Gallaher will add 
height as well as a backup for Cunningham. Depth in the backcourt will be a key 
factor if the Irish are to return to postseason play. Eguchi, Kubota and 
Westall will help run the up-tempo offense. Montoya, a transfer from Western, 
should play a lot, along with fellow junior newcomer Vetica. A near 
non-existent summer program could result in a slow start, but Harrison is 
confident the kinks will be worked out by the time league season begins.

 Returning all five starters from last year's second-place squad has Raya 
thinking league title. The Golden Hawks should be stronger at every position. 
They return two all-league senior forwards in Renken and de Bruijn. Renken 
averaged 13 points and 14 rebounds and de Bruijn averaged 13 points and 12 
boards. Jamie Nebeker returns after a freshman year that saw her average 10 
points and earn all-league honors. She will be joined by Korsmeier and Bryant, 
all-league honorable mention guards last year, in the backcourt. Raya also 
returns three-year letterman Shannon Nebeker and Gibney, who, along with Reott, 
gives the Golden Hawks one of the deepest backcourts in the league. Team 
quickness and experience should allow the Golden Hawks to run their fast break 
offense. Raya says this team has more talent than the '93 league champions who 
were 25-3 and advanced to the playoff semifinals. SCHEDULE

SINGAPORE RACES FOR SPOT ON INFORMATION HIGHWAY; TECHNOLOGY: IT IS BOOSTING TV 
AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES BUT WON'T RELAX STRICT LOCAL CENSORSHIP POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singapore's push to be Asia's hub on the information superhighway is led by a 
40-year-old air force reserve brigadier-general who believes new technology and 
conservative Asian values can thrive together. 
</P>
<P>
 George Yong-Boon Yeo, minister for information and the arts, says Singapore 
could become Asia's broadcast and program production center despite the 
city-state's tough censorship laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be everyone's favorite oasis on the information superhighway," Yeo 
told Reuters in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may not want to live there (Singapore) forever, but you still want to 
stop there and refresh yourself before you go into the desert again," said Yeo, 
who studied engineering at Cambridge and has an MBA from Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that Singapore would not tolerate erosion of its conservative 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to create a small Hollywood. We don't want the environment, the 
social mores, the scandal, the loose life, of a Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 What Singapore does want is high-technology media companies, and the ancillary 
services that go with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to develop a pool of expertise in Singapore. Editors, 
pre-production people, post-production, graphics and software people. We 
encourage the setting up of film studios. If someone needs to shoot a scene and 
coordinate traffic, the authorities will accommodate their needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as export-oriented services, Yeo is overseeing the opening up of 
Singapore's internal market. The whole island is being wired with a fiber-optic 
network so cable television can begin transmitting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeo expects that the cable TV service, run by a conglomerate called Singapore 
CableVision, will eventually offer more than the 30 channels now planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will increase the number of channels from 30 channels. How can it be 
enough? We intend to let in French television, Japanese TV, Chinese TV, German 
TV, Australian TV and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore government also plans to allow Singapore Telecom to provide 
services over the fiber-optic system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are allowing Singapore Telecom to go in with a network, and there is the 
SCV network," Yeo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister believes the cable will turn Singapore's tight restrictions on 
ownership of satellite dishes into a meaningless issue. "If it (cable TV) is 
readily available with as many channels as you have time for, why go through 
the hassle of installing a home satellite dish?" Yeo said. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called "free-to-air" television is also being transformed. The 
government-owned broadcasting monopoly was recently restructured, hived off 
from Yeo's ministry and put under control of a new Broadcasting Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The monopoly was broken up into five new units with their own corporate 
structures to foster a private sector spirit ahead of actual privatization, 
which Yeo said would come eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a timetable for privatization, but it is a very rough timetable," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeo said it was possible in the future that there could be more channels to 
add to the current three broadcast stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In principle I've got nothing against it," he said. "Free-to-air television 
will have to be limited in numbers so that it is a commercial market, so that 
we have not diluted it so that they are all forced to go down market." 
</P>
<P>
 This concern with the moral content of broadcast media permeates everything 
the minister does and reflects the conservatism of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents with their children become uncomfortable if they see jarring scenes, 
whether this be violence or pornography or swear words or social situations 
which should only be reserved for very mature audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention is to keep local television at least wholesome, and very 
reflective of the conservative values of Singaporeans," the minister said.

JAPAN'S NEWSPAPERS HESITANT ABOUT MULTIMEDIA; INFORMATION: MANY TOP EXECUTIVES 
ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT ROLES THE NEW COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WILL PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to multimedia, Japan's top newspapers are spending more time 
writing and raving about it than preparing for the day it turns their industry 
upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of action reflects uncertainty about multimedia's impact on 
newspapers, bureaucratic problems and financial constraints caused by Japan's 
worst post-war recession, senior Japanese journalists and newspaper advertising 
executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, many top newspapers here set up think-tanks to work out 
exactly what multimedia will mean for their industry and what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But these think-tanks are unlikely to come out with concrete proposals until 
mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Akihiro Kamitsuka, managing editor of daily Asahi Shimbun, said the reason his 
paper was taking a cautious approach to multimedia is that it still is not 
clear about what it will mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States talks about laying fiber-optic cables around the whole of 
Japan (as part of the information superhighway) but that could cost as much as 
120 trillion yen ($1.23 trillion)," Kamitsuka told Reuters in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "And anyway, how long is it going to take to link every household in Japan 
with fiber-optic cable?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asahi, whose circulation of 12 million is more than six times that of any 
American newspaper, set up a think-tank to grapple with multimedia this April. 
It has already issued a preliminary report, but Kamitsuka said the paper will 
not unveil its plans publicly until December, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamitsuka was attending a big annual newspaper convention last month in this 
ancient western Japanese city, which celebrates its 1,200th anniversary this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Junichi Arai, editor-in-chief of business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun, which 
has a circulation of 4.5 million, told Reuters his paper would be unveiling a 
"multimedia terminal" at a big Tokyo electronics fair in mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Nihon Keizai, which will be 120 years old in 1996, will use reactions to this 
terminal as the basis for its decision on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Multimedia is one of the pillars of the future for our paper and we are 
putting a lot of effort into it," said Arai, who was also attending the 
newspaper convention in Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a lot, but still don't really know what it means. The idea is 
that you'll be able to send pictures, sound and text electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 "But will it be for home use? Or will it be for businesses? Until that's 
cleared up it's hard to know what to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asahi editor Kamitsuka said the nation's bureaucrats were another reason 
Japanese papers were grappling with multimedia less urgently than many of their 
overseas counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is erecting 
barriers along the path of progress in an attempt to grab power from other 
ministries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newspapers are free of restrictions in Japan. But the minute you stray into 
telecommunications, it gets complicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some newspaper advertising executives said another reason Japanese 
papers were taking a laid-back approach to multimedia was that many were 
suffering from the weak economy, which has prompted most companies to slash 
advertising budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising in Japan fell to $52.8 billion in 1993 from a peak of $57.3 
billion in 1990, according to Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Assn. 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper advertising has fallen by as much as 20% because the bursting of 
Japan's financial bubble hit the newspapers' biggest advertisers -- real estate 
and financial companies -- particularly hard, according to an advertising 
executive at a top Japanese newspaper.

KEY WITNESS IN 2 OFFICERS' SLAYINGS BALKS; COURTS: COMPTON HAS PAID MAN $11,000 
FOR LODGING AND RELOCATION. BUT AFTER HIS MOTHER'S SLAYING, HE SAYS HE WILL NOT 
TESTIFY UNLESS HE RECEIVES MORE MONEY TO MOVE HIS RELATIVES TO SAFETY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By most accounts, Calvin Cooksey was treated like royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The key witness in the murders of two Compton police officers, he was put up 
in a nice hotel where $8,500 worth of lodging and meals were paid for by the 
city of Compton. The city also gave him $2,500 in "relocation" cash and 
promised a share of reward money. The district attorney's office dropped a 
weapons possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that his testimony in the high-profile case put him and his family in 
danger, Cooksey has demanded more money to relocate his relatives. He blames 
authorities for his mother's death, claiming that she was killed as an act of 
revenge for his testimony. And he says he will not testify in the upcoming 
murder trial of suspect Regis Thomas unless he receives more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey's threat has put the police killing case -- one of the most notorious 
in Compton's history -- in jeopardy. It has also exposed the risky process that 
some law enforcement agencies use to solidify their cases: buying the 
cooperation of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a fine line, experts say, between legitimately helping a witness in 
danger and paying for a version of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a wise course to go around promising money to people. It tends to 
color their testimony. It's a potential bribe," said Gigi Gordon, a Santa 
Monica defense attorney appointed by the Superior Court as an expert on a 
series of jailhouse informant scandals in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Most witnesses who receive help get it through the district attorney's witness 
protection program. Unlike occasional federal efforts -- in which some who 
testify get a new identity, plastic surgery and jobs in faraway cities -- the 
county program usually offers first and last months' rent for a new apartment 
in a safer location. In the last fiscal year, the county gave relocation funds 
to witnesses in 93 cases, and to victims in 49 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems are more likely to occur when individual cities such as Compton agree 
to augment the county program with extra funds, or when a witness agrees to 
testify because he or she expects cash in exchange for helping the prosecution. 
The district attorney's office says it never agrees to such a quid pro quo, 
reasoning that if the implication of cash-for-testimony arises, defense 
attorneys can exploit it in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things do happen, unfortunately," said Compton Police Chief Hourie 
Taylor, who dealt directly with Cooksey on several occasions. "One of the most 
difficult things to handle, especially in high-profile cases, is witness 
coordination. . . . This whole thing is very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest potential disappointment now facing prosecutors is that Cooksey -- 
the witness who links the murder weapon to accused killer Thomas -- could be 
discredited in front of a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "An argument could be made that he (Cooksey) is a bought witness," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Mark Arnold, who is prosecuting Thomas. However Arnold, who was 
kept aware of Compton's payments to Cooksey, refused to criticize the city's 
conduct. He said he believes Cooksey will remain credible because "he broke 
this case long before he was given anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey, a 33-year-old ex-convict, became vitally important to the Compton 
Police Department in March, 1993, when he told police he knew who killed 
Officers Kevin Michael Burrell and James Wayne MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers, gunned down execution-style while making a traffic stop a month 
earlier, were killed by Thomas, Cooksey said -- and Cooksey knew where police 
could find the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey told police he had met up with Thomas a couple of weeks after the 
officers were shot, while the story was still hot in the media. Thomas was 
nervously trying to get rid of a gun he had used to kill two cops, Cooksey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Cooksey said in an interview, he asked Thomas if the suspect was 
talking about the two Compton officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I killed them. They slipped, man," Cooksey claims Thomas said, 
referring to a procedural mistake the officers might have made in stopping 
Thomas' truck that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey offered to get rid of the gun for Thomas, saying he knew a safe place 
to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I immediately went out and sold it to make a couple of hundred bucks out 
of the deal," he said. "Because, really, I didn't believe it. I didn't believe 
he capped (killed) those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, Cooksey was arrested on an unrelated weapons possession charge. 
For 24 hours, he sat in jail. When no one came to bail him out, he said, he 
decided to try to trade his story for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey and authorities sharply disagree on most of what came after. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Cooksey recounts it, once he told law enforcement officers that he 
knew something about a police killer, they promised he would be protected, 
probably get a cash reward and relocation money for his mother, three sisters, 
a list of cousins and five children he has fathered with five women. 
</P>
<P>
 The way police and prosecutors tell it, Cooksey voluntarily told them his 
entire story, and they felt obligated to protect him -- but made no commitments 
to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cooksey talked to police, investigators found the gun they say was used 
to kill Burrell and MacDonald in the hands of the man Cooksey said he had sold 
it to. Ballistic tests confirmed that the gun was the murder weapon. Thomas was 
arrested on first-degree murder charges that could lead to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1993, after Cooksey testified at Thomas' preliminary hearing, 
prosecutors dropped the weapons possession charge -- a deal both sides agree 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months that followed, Compton paid Cooksey's living expenses -- an 
unusual move for a city, according to witness protection experts. The city 
budget lists no category for such a program. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the largess, Cooksey's relationship with the city soured -- 
particularly in July, when he received a death threat to his extended family.  
</P>
<P>
 The threat was ignored by police, Cooksey said, and weeks later his mother was 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola Pirtle Woods, 51, was killed by a gunshot to the chest on East 114th 
Street. Police believe that a street gang -- to which Thomas belonged -- in the 
nearby Nickerson Gardens housing project was involved in the killing. However, 
investigators believe her death was an accident rather than an act of 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' trial is scheduled to begin in February. Police say they still expect 
Cooksey to keep his promise to testify. But Cooksey insists he is through 
cooperating, at least until police pay him additional family relocation funds 
-- and maybe not even then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ain't interested in (civic) duty," said Cooksey, who is living out of state 
and says he has a construction job. "I want my money like I made a deal for." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he does not testify at the trial, Cooksey could be eligible for a 
share of the $45,000 city reward that was offered for information leading to 
the killer's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey says he bartered with Sheriff's Deputy Larry Brandenburg and Compton 
police for protection for his entire extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandenburg, who is assigned to a special gang unit, was not available for 
comment, but prosecutor Arnold denied the assertion, saying it was far beyond 
the limits of the county's witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to make him (Cooksey) promises like that," Arnold said. 
"They wouldn't do that. They can't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they are astonished by Cooksey's anger because they went 
beyond the call of duty to keep him cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months after Cooksey testified in Thomas' preliminary hearing in 
October, 1993, Compton housed him at the Ramada Hotel, which the city had 
acquired after a developer defaulted on a city loan. The city also paid for 
three meals a day and Cooksey's phone calls. The final hotel bill was $8,500, 
according to Cooksey's receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials admit that Cooksey was housed at the Ramada, but will not say 
how much it cost. Another witness in the police murder case, whom police will 
not identify, also stayed at the Ramada, according to several hotel and police 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey's stay at the hotel ended in April after he assaulted a security guard 
who found him kicking a hotel cigarette machine, police said. Whether Cooksey 
was kicked out or left on his own remains in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 So does the nature of the $2,500 that the city paid him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chief Taylor, the money, paid to Cooksey about three months after 
he testified at Thomas' preliminary hearing, was a "relocation" check from the 
city, to be reimbursed from the county's witness protection funds. County 
officials declined to comment on whether reimbursement was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey was supposed to use the money to move to a new apartment, according to 
Taylor. But Cooksey said it was "walking-around money" from the city. He said 
he blew it all in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Cooksey spent the check on a gambling spree will likely do the 
most damage to his credibility with a jury, legal experts said. It could show 
that Cooksey believed -- rightly or wrongly -- that he was receiving cash for 
helping prosecutors rather than to protect him from harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always inappropriate to pay a witness for testimony," said former 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay, a criminal defense lawyer in San Pedro. 
"It's only appropriate to (pay to) shield a witness from imminent danger. It's 
a bright line, but a hard one to identify at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury may be more suspect of a witness who's been paid by police when the 
police have a significant interest in the case," Livesay added. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey has filed a $125-million claim against Compton in the wake of his 
mother's death.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 24, Cooksey said, he was at a girlfriend's house in Azusa when someone 
rang the doorbell. Nobody was there when he looked out, but he found a note on 
the doorstep made of pasted-together letters from magazines and newspapers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Die alone," the note read. "You can't relax here. . . . Try putting yourself 
in the position of losing your sisters and mother over the police." 
</P>
<P>
 The Azusa Police Department opened a file on the case, and officers in the 
Compton and Los Angeles police departments acknowledge that they were informed 
of the death threat. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 a.m. on Aug. 6, Viola Woods was pushing her shopping cart on East 
114th when police broke up a "gang party" nearby. Police said Woods sometimes 
stayed with a friend in Nickerson Gardens, but was mostly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were gangsters on every corner when that party was broken up. She got 
caught in the cross-fire," said Los Angeles Police Detective Otis Marlow, who 
is investigating the case. "But they weren't aiming at her. They would've had 
to shoot through 10 people to get to where she was, mid-block." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Arnold says he is not worried about Cooksey's threat not to testify 
at Thomas' murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he'll testify," Arnold said. "He's going to court and he'll get on that 
stand and he will testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what he will say."

FORCED OUT OF FIRE ACADEMY, WOMEN SAY; HIRING: EX-RECRUITS CONTEND THAT AN 
AUDIT ACCURATELY DESCRIBES HARASSMENT INTENDED TO MAKE THEM QUIT THE CITY 
DEPARTMENT. AN ASSISTANT CHIEF DISPUTES THE INQUIRY'S FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even after she reported that she had pulled a muscle in her back, then-fire 
recruit Diane Cameron said the drill instructor ordered her to repeatedly lift 
a heavy ladder as he ridiculed her and the other women trainees.  
</P>
<P>
 They were too weak and didn't have what it took to be firefighters in the Los 
Angeles City Fire Department, he allegedly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made my life and other females' lives miserable," said Cameron, 27, a 
5-foot-10-inch, 160-pound athlete who filed a state discrimination complaint 
against the department last month. "They basically ran us off the department." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past seven years, about 40% of women recruits washed out of the Fire 
Department's training academy, where they were reportedly "weeded out" by 
instructors who treated them more harshly than male recruits and relied on 
"subjective" evaluations, a city audit found. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings of the 225-page Personnel Department audit -- one of the most 
critical evaluations ever made of the Fire Department -- were disclosed 
Saturday by The Times. The audit said widespread cronyism, nepotism and racial 
discrimination were believed responsible for the department's inability to 
integrate its top-level administration, which is 95% white male. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit found that the training academy -- where recruits are drilled in the 
physical and technical aspects of firefighting during an intensive, 15-week 
course -- was the focal point of problems in a department that has had 
difficulty retaining women and minorities. Women make up only 3% of the 
3,100-member department. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of women who quit the academy or were fired was about twice the 
rate of male recruits, according to the audit, which will be released Wednesday 
at a hearing of the City Council's Personnel Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the academy was restructured to allow recruits who were having 
trouble to repeat training instead of being fired. But that helped fuel 
resentment among many white firefighters, who felt that training standards were 
lowered, and who tried to run rookie women and minorities out of the 
department, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, attrition rates for minorities -- especially African Americans -- 
have been higher than those for white males. About 33% of all black 
firefighters hired in that period have left the department -- twice the 
percentage of white firefighters, according to Fire Department data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attrition rates at the academy and during the remainder of probation need to 
be analyzed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the department is not only 
applying job-related performance standards, but is doing all it can to 
'encourage' rather than 'weed out' recruits," said the draft audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Dean E. Cathey, a department spokesman, disputed the audit's 
findings Monday, saying he has spoken with many women firefighters and never 
received complaints about abusive treatment in the academy or firehouses.  
</P>
<P>
 "To a person, I've never had one tell me that they have a lousy work 
environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the three council members who serve on the Personnel Committee said 
Monday that they have received numerous complaints from current women 
firefighters who are afraid to speak out for fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of fear of coming forward by women on the Fire Department is much 
higher than women on the Police Department," said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, 
the committee chairwoman, who has studied sexual harassment in the city's work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg, who said the failure rate for women is "a cause of grave concern," 
noted that her office has received about two dozen complaints since the audit's 
findings were reported in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the department leadership has to understand that there is an 
atmosphere of intimidation in the Fire Department," Councilman Mike Hernandez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said he was approached in person Sunday by a 
number of firefighters commenting on the audit. "They were just relieved that 
the issue has finally seen the light of day," he said, "and in more than one 
instance, indicated that the situation is worse that the report said." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Cathey faulted women who complain anonymously for not coming 
forward. "People who complain about discrimination privately and not publicly 
probably get what they deserve . . . because nothing will change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason women fail in the academy, Cathey said, is that they lack the 
physical strength to do tasks such as lifting ladders and pulling heavy hoses. 
Women selected for the academy must pass the same physical skills test as men, 
but Cathey said that exam is not rigid enough to accurately assess whether a 
candidate has the strength needed for the job. The Personnel Department is 
currently reviewing all hiring procedures for firefighter candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Women in the academy, according to interviews with former recruits and 
findings in the audit, were treated more harshly and drilled harder than their 
male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Diane Cameron's 1993 class, in which 28 of the 64 recruits were women, she 
said minority women were treated the worst, followed by white women, then 
minority men. Of the women, 11 quit or were fired before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was such an atmosphere of intimidation there," said Cameron, who added 
that the "macho" mentality among some of the instructors was "like a high 
school football team gone crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 She and other female recruits said they were constantly told that they did not 
belong in the fire service, ordered to repeat tasks such as raising ladders 
more than men, and subjected to insensitive remarks such as: "You have hearts 
of an eagle, but bodies of a pigeon," and, "You're like European sports cars. 
You run on high r.p.m.'s but need continuous maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 In her complaint filed Oct. 13 with the state Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, Cameron alleges that she was told she would be terminated within 
two days if her back did not heal from the pulled-muscle injury caused by 
raising ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hurt physically and emotionally, Cameron said, she quit rather than face 
termination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally depressed and ended up getting an ulcer," said Cameron, an avid 
surfer and weightlifter who is still trying to become a firefighter with other 
departments. "But in a way, I was kind of glad to leave. Who wants to spend 20 
years in that kind of environment?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Harter, 22, who was in Cameron's class, walked out two weeks before 
graduation because of what she says was the constant abuse. She, too, filed a 
discrimination complaint with the state last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a living hell. It was the worst experience I have ever been through in 
my entire life," said Harter, who last week set a women's record for the 
physical agility test administered by the Ventura County Fire Department.  
</P>
<P>
 "They kept saying I was going to be fired. I finally had it and walked off," 
said Harter, who claims she was treated even worse after she complained that a 
male recruit was making constant sexual remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Harter recalled one particularly disturbing incident allegedly involving a 
black female recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 As the woman put on a protective face mask, a white fire instructor took a 
puff from his cigar, blew the smoke into a hose leading to the recruit's mask 
and plugged the end with his hand. He then laughed while the woman gagged and 
said, "That's so you know what it (smoke) feels like," Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
 A male recruit in the same class who was quoted in the Personnel Department's 
audit also reported that women were treated differently than the men. He said 
all the recruits were reminded daily by the instructors that it was the worst 
class instructors had ever taught because half the students were women. 
</P>
<P>
 The class became polarized, the male recruit said. "It became male vs. female. 
If one of the females needed extra help or something, it was the females that 
helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathey said the department offers personal strength training for women during 
recruitment to prepare them for the department's physical agility test. 
</P>
<P>
 And to improve attrition rates, the Fire Department completely revamped the 
training academy curriculum in 1993 with the help of outside advisers. The new 
techniques have reduced male attrition rates this year from about 20% to 12%. 
But the failure rate for women increased to 56%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathey said he was not sure why the percentage increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Donald O. Manning last week proposed a $2-million department 
reorganization that would create a 17-person human resources bureau to study 
ways of improving retention rates for women and minorities and improve tracking 
of discrimination and harassment complaints.

THE BIG BANGS; SONIC BOOMS FROM SPACE SHUTTLE STARTLE QUAKE-RATTLED SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A returning space shuttle set off twin sonic booms over Los Angeles early 
Monday, jolting residents whose nerves have been frayed by the Northridge 
earthquake and countless aftershocks this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The safe touchdown by Atlantis and its six-member crew was the third Southern 
California shuttle landing in three months, but the first two descents 
approached Edwards Air Force Base from the west and north, so that the booms 
were barely heard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Atlantis hurtled back to Earth from the south, passing over the 
heavily populated Los Angeles Basin on its way to Edwards. It set off the twin 
booms about 7:30 a.m., while many residents were still swallowing their coffee 
and cornflakes -- or sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Many were caught off guard by the thunder-like blasts because NASA officials, 
watching storm conditions in Florida, did not officially move the landing site 
to California until about 2 a.m. Monday. Some residents contacted Edwards to 
inquire about the noise or to express irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an idea that people are more sensitive to something like this because 
of the earthquake," NASA spokesman Don Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short news conference Monday afternoon, the six astronauts chuckled 
when informed that some residents mistook their man-made booms for fresh Earth 
tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Lt. Col. Curtis Brown, the mission's pilot, said the shuttle was 
traveling at three or four times the speed of sound -- or up to 2,800 m.p.h. -- 
when it passed over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic booms are created when a speeding aircraft pushes aside air molecules in 
its path, forming shock waves. The sharp release of pressure from these shock 
waves causes the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All supersonic aircraft set off twin sonic booms, one at the nose and one at 
the tail. But when small military jets break the sound barrier, the booms 
follow one another so quickly that people usually hear it as one sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The space shuttles, at 122 feet long, produce a gap of about half a second 
between the nose and tail sounds, resulting in the distinctive double booms 
familiar to High Desert residents. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials said sonic booms sound louder in canyon areas, where the noise 
reverberates, and are more intense on days like Monday, when few clouds are 
present to muffle the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis pilot Brown said he was paying more attention to the sights outside 
his window than the sounds that his descent was creating. "I had a perfect view 
of the L.A. area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, NASA designated the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as the primary 
landing site for its shuttles, with Edwards as the backup. But bad weather in 
Florida forced the agency to divert Discovery to Edwards on Sept. 20 and 
Endeavour to Edwards on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Landings at Edwards add about $1 million to the cost of each mission, NASA 
officials say, largely because the vessel must be ferried back to Florida atop 
a jet.

TEACHER FACES MURDER COUNT IN DRIVER'S BEATING

 A San Fernando Valley middle school teacher who allegedly helped a group of 
gang members pull a man from a car and beat him to death with fists, sticks and 
pool cues in vengeance over a traffic accident was being held Monday on 
suspicion of murder, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's brother was seriously injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Denneth Thaddeus Jackson, 26, a social studies teacher at Madison Middle 
School in North Hollywood since September, was being held in lieu of $1 million 
bail and will be arraigned on murder charges today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was placed on unpaid leave by the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
which is standard policy for employees charged with felonies, said school 
district spokesman Bill Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a pretty good idea he was actively involved (in the beatings)," said 
LAPD Detective Joel Price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked," Sol Bialeck, the school's assistant principal, said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Two juveniles allegedly involved in the beatings have been released to their 
parents pending the formal filing of charges, while seven arrested adults, 
ranging in age from 18 to 22, will be either arraigned or released today, said 
LAPD Detective Rick Swanston. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started early Saturday while Jackson was having a party at his 
apartment in the 7100 block of Amigo Avenue in Reseda, investigators said.  
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers, including juveniles, drank alcohol and smoked marijuana, police 
said. Also present were several members of a local gang who were Jackson's 
friends, although Jackson himself is not a gang member, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:30 a.m., the party-goers heard a crash on the street, and several 
rushed out to find that a pickup truck belonging to one of them had been struck 
by a car driven by 23-year-old Julio Aguilar.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Aguilar, who was intoxicated, wanted to make a deal with 
the truck's owner to avoid arrest, but other party-goers called police.  
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor, who declined to be identified, said Aguilar appeared to be trying 
to flee, and fought with the party-goers who restrained him until officers 
arrested Aguilar on suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:30 a.m., Aguilar's brother, Jose, 21, and 29-year-old uncle, Tony 
Orellana, bailed him out of jail, and the three -- apparently on their way home 
-- drove past the scene of the accident to look at the damage to the truck, 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 An argument broke out at the scene with the party-goers, who dragged the 
brothers out of the car, leaving Orellana in the back seat, and began beating 
them with lumber and pool cues, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orellana climbed into the front seat of the car and drove home. 
Jose Aguilar also managed to escape and met Orellana at their nearby house 
briefly before returning to try to rescue his brother, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten male party-goers, including Jackson, continued beating Julio Aguilar and 
began striking Jose Aguilar before Jose was able to escape a second time, Price 
said. Jose Aguilar was in serious condition at a Northridge hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson had been a playground supervisor for the school district since 1990 
and recently obtained a teaching credential, Rivera said.

DANA TO RETIRE AS SUPERVISOR IN '96; BACKS AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing the game of political musical chairs being played at the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Supervisor Deane Dana has announced that 
he plans to retire when his term expires in 1996 and that he supports his chief 
deputy, Don Knabe, to be his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is the time to move on," Dana, a supervisor for 16 years, said 
in a letter sent to supporters last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana, a 68-year-old former telephone company manager and Republican Party 
activist, rode President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1980 to a seat on 
the then all-white, all-male county board controlled by like-minded 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the five-member board is made up of two women -- one Latina and one 
African American -- and dominated by Democrats.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, longtime Supervisors Pete Schabarum and Kenneth Hahn have 
left the board and Ed Edelman is due to retire next month. Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich plans to seek reelection in 1996, an aide said. The supervisors have 
no term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Dana survived a tough challenge from Rolling Hills Mayor Gordana 
Swanson in the 4th District, which stretches along the coast from Malibu to 
Long Beach and inland to Diamond Bar.  
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Dana was criticized for allowing county bureaucrats to 
approve lucrative pension benefits for supervisors and senior county officials 
and for being chauffeured in a bulletproof car that cost $74,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe much has been accomplished in bringing more efficient and 
responsive government to the county," Dana said in his letter.  
</P>
<P>
 "However, I also believe this is the time to move on and assure continuity by 
electing my chief deputy Don Knabe supervisor of the 4th District." 
</P>
<P>
 Knabe has served as a Cerritos councilman and as Dana's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana's announcement caught some by surprise because it is unusual for 
incumbents to declare themselves lame ducks two years before their terms 
expire. Some say that the lame-duck status limits an incumbent's effectiveness. 
Political observers said they believe that Dana made his announcement early to 
give Knabe an opportunity to begin campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1980 campaign, Dana plastered the picture of Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a 
black appointed to the board, in mailers sent to voters in the predominantly 
white district. Burke was elected in 1992 to succeed Hahn.

 A junior high school teacher who helped a group of gang members pull a man 
from a car and beat him to death with fists, sticks and pool cues in vengeance 
for a traffic accident was being held Monday on suspicion of murder, Los

parents pending formal charges, while seven arrested adults, ranging in age 
from 18 to 22, will either be arraigned or released today, said LAPD Detective 
Rick Swanston. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The bizarre incident started early Saturday while Jackson was hosting a party 
in his apartment at 7134 Amigo Ave. in Reseda, investigators said.  
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers, including juveniles, drank alcohol and smoked marijuana, police 
said. Also present were several friends of Jackson's who are members of a local 
gang, although Jackson himself is not a gang member, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:30 a.m., the partyers heard a crash in the street. Several rushed out 
to find that a pickup truck belonging to one of them had been struck by a car 
driven by Julio Aguilar, 23, who lived in the neighborhood but did not know the 
gang members, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, investigators said Aguilar, who was intoxicated, wanted to 
make a deal with the truck's owner to avoid arrest, but other party-goers 
called police.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was crying," Price said. "He just wanted to pay for it and go home, but 
they didn't want to let him because he didn't have any insurance, and they 
didn't know him. And in the beginning, these guys did the right thing by 
calling police." 
</P>
<P>
 But a neighbor, who declined to be identified, said Aguilar appeared to be 
trying to flee and fought with the party-goers, who restrained Aguilar until 
officers arrived and arrested him on suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:30 a.m., Aguilar's brother Jose, 21, and 29-year-old uncle Tony 
Orellana bailed him out of jail, and the three -- apparently on their way home 
-- drove past the scene of the accident to look at the damage to the truck, 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stopped in the street and were looking at the car, and I think at that 
point the whole thing just deteriorated, with people shouting at each other and 
making threats," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the party-goers dragged the brothers out of the car, leaving Orellana in 
the back seat, and began beating them, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had pieces of lumber and pool cues, and they also beat them with fists 
and kicked them," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orellana climbed into the front seat of the car and drove home. 
Jose Aguilar also managed to escape and met Orellana at their house briefly 
before returning to try to rescue his brother, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, 10 male party-goers, including Jackson, continued beating Julio 
Aguilar and began striking Jose Aguilar before Jose was able to escape a second 
time, Price said. Jose was in serious condition at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center on Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived, they arrested six people apparently trying to flee in a 
car, and four others in Jackson's apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults arrested with Jackson were identified as: William Ronald Davis, an 
18-year-old pool cleaner from Reseda; James John Martinez, a 19-year-old 
laborer from Van Nuys; Richard Lee Baker, a 20-year-old construction worker 
from Reseda; Marvin Lewis Foster Jr., a 22-year-old construction worker from 
Reseda; Joe Luis Macias, a 21-year-old construction worker from North Hills; 
Oswaldo Ramos Perez, 19, a Reseda stock clerk; and Brian Hernandez, an 
unemployed 19-year-old from Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson had been a playground supervisor for the school district since 1990 
and recently obtained a teaching credential, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was new to teaching this semester, he impressed other teachers 
with the seemingly effortless way he won the respect of his students, said 
Bialeck, the assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids like him very much," Bialeck said. "He relates very well to the 
kids, is very in tune with them." 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent anti-Proposition 187 demonstrations at the school, Bialeck 
said Jackson told the children to act responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very strong and very reasonable and they listened to him," Bialeck 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At the same apartment complex in 1992, a special weapons and tactics team 
fatally shot a heavily armed man who was holding his 3-year-old daughter 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a resident said that in addition to the hostage situation two years 
ago and Saturday's beating death, there have been pipe bombs, automatic weapons 
fire and several hit-and-run accidents in the tiny area since she moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ain't no nice neighborhood," she said. "But you've got to live 
somewhere."

A DATE WITH TRAGEDY; HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT CLAIMS LIFE OF GIRL, 16, AFTER 
HOMECOMING DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day she turned 16, Lilia Barajas slipped into a tight black dress and 
platform shoes, blessed herself and left home on her first date ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Lupe, had a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be careful. You don't know what other people are doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, Barajas had been struck by a hit-and-run driver after leaving 
the Glendale High School homecoming dance Friday. She died of massive head 
injuries on Saturday at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 While police sought witnesses Monday to the tragedy, which took place near The 
Castaway banquet rooms in Burbank, Lilia's date nursed the broken arm he 
suffered as he tried to pull her away from danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalo Espinoza, 16 and a junior at Allan F. Daily High School, said in an 
interview they had been walking down a hillside road when they saw the car 
speeding toward them with bright headlights on. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza said he urged Barajas to cross the road quickly to reach the safety 
of a sidewalk, but she struggled in her platform shoes. Both crossed the center 
divider and were struck as the car swerved into the lane for oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it was coming, I told her, 'Get on the left-hand side before you get run 
over,' " he recalled. "We tried walking faster, but the car came faster. I 
tried to pull her. She was in shock. She was scared. She stood still. There was 
nothing I could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "These types of things happen, but I'm angry. Why would (the driver) just run 
straight at us? I just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Monday interviewed Glendale High School students and compiled a list 
of names of the estimated 1,000 people who were using the banquet rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the homecoming dance Friday, police said, two other functions 
were taking place when a dark 1983 to 1987 Chevrolet Camaro sped out of one of 
The Castaway's parking lots: a wedding banquet and a gathering of Armenian 
students from UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be witnesses," said Burbank Police Detective Richard A. Bison. 
"Somebody saw this accident. There's no doubt in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or somebody knows whose vehicle this was." 
</P>
<P>
 At the campus of Glendale High School, Barajas' death dampened the spirits of 
students who had just completed a successful homecoming week, capped by the 
football team's first win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Between classes, some students wept as they spoke of the tragedy. Others 
smiled at the memory of a girl who was neither a leader nor a loser, a 
fun-loving teen-ager who liked to shop at the Glendale Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really happy that night. And she died happy," said Lisset Gomez, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family say the 11th-grader was thrilled about turning 16 and 
celebrating at the homecoming dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme for the dance was "One More Night" and Barajas was going with 
Espinoza, a former boyfriend from junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas' mother said she worried constantly about her daughter's safety at 
night and regularly asked questions about whom she was going out with and when 
she would return. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, she said speaking through an interpreter, there seemed to be no 
reason to worry. Family members stayed at Barajas' bedside for hours, softly 
whispering into her ear and watching her try to move her finger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was telling her to get better. We'd fix her room and take her out to 
celebrate," said Barajas' sister, Sonia, 21. "Tears rolled down her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has to pay for what they did to her. I lost my baby sister on her 
birthday. Why is she paying for this? This is so unfair. We need help."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGHLAND PARK; 
SKATEBOARD DEATH SPURS LAPD WARNING TO PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 9-year-old boy's death in a skateboard accident in Highland Park -- the 
second such accident in the area in recent weeks -- prompted police to remind 
parents Monday about the dangers of the sport.  
</P>
<P>
 Jezraeel Leodones was killed Sunday afternoon when he sat on his skateboard 
and rode down a 30-foot driveway into the path of a car, said Los Angeles 
Police Detective Loren Zimmerman of the Central Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second such accident in six weeks in the neighborhood, he said. A 
6-year-old boy was killed Sept. 30 when he sat down on his skateboard and raced 
out a driveway into the path of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier incident occurred about a mile from Sunday's accident in the 6100 
block of Springvale Drive, Zimmerman said. Neither motorist was cited.  
</P>
<P>
 "Parents should be cautioned that skateboarding, in itself, is dangerous even 
for adults," Zimmerman said. "Parents should not allow this activity by their 
children or on their property," the detective said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; U.S. 
SUPREME COURT REJECTS APPEAL BY EX-LAPD OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear an appeal by an ex-assistant 
Los Angeles police chief who sued the city over an investigation into whether 
his religious beliefs affected his job performance.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Vernon, an elder in Sun Valley's Grace Community Church, said the 1991 
Police Commission-ordered probe hindered his ability to practice his religion. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in charge of the Los Angeles Police Department's Office of Operations 
under former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates from 1978 to June, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am very disappointed that the court declined to hear my case, where my 
career and reputation were destroyed by religious bigotry," Vernon said in a 
statement released by his attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorney David Casterline said "the Supreme Court's declination to grant a 
review sets a dangerous precedent affecting all public employees and religious 
persons."  
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the nation's highest 
court validated the decision to look into the allegations about Vernon.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky was named as a defendant in Vernon's lawsuit, along with the city, 
City Council and then-Police Commissioners Jesse Brewer, Stanley Sheinbaum and 
Melanie Lomax.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; DEAF STUDENTS AT WORK ON FLOAT FOR TOURNAMENT OF 
ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a month and half to go until the new year, deaf students at Cal State 
Northridge have started decorating their Tournament of Roses Parade float: a 
giant leopard with her two cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just starting from scratch right now.The float is not done. . . . We 
have worked on the paws of the mother leopard and the side of the body," said 
Sandra Jahn, a deaf graduate student at CSUN, who spent Saturday working on the 
float. 
</P>
<P>
 "The float is magnificent. Beautiful. And huge," Jahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has spent the last seven years at CSUN, and this year is chairwoman of the 
Deaf CSUNian Rose Parade Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years now, the National Center on Deafness at CSUN -- which has the 
largest higher education program for the deaf outside of Gallaudet University 
in Washington -- has teamed up with Kodak to build award-winning floats to 
raise public awareness about the deaf and the hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The center provides sign language, interpreters, note takers and tutors to 
deaf students at CSUN.  
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is that people in general begin to learn that deaf people are like 
them and the deaf community, in the nation, are hard-working people and love to 
get along with everyone," Jahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, the dry materials will be added to the float. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last week of the year, about 200 volunteers, both deaf and hearing, 
are expected to help decorate the giant leopard float with yellow, gold and 
orange marigolds. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; HEARING OVER TALL SIGNS IS WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of business owners who sued the city of Agoura Hills to keep their 
outlawed pole-mounted signs standing will have their day in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled at 9 a.m. in Van Nuys Superior Court, said Robert Aran, 
one of the attorneys representing the 12 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Aran said that under California's Business and Professions Code, the business 
owners have the right to keep their tall signs because they draw customers from 
the freeway. They would lose that business if the signs were dismantled, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These particular businesses are locationally disadvantaged, and they cannot 
continue to communicate with the public if they comply with the applicable city 
law," said Aran.  
</P>
<P>
 The city banned pole signs in 1985. In a referendum later that year, voters 
supported the ban 3 to 1. A city initiative that would have overturned the pole 
sign ordinance lost overwhelmingly last November. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs were to have been removed by March, 1992, but several businesses 
refused and began filing separate lawsuits earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has created hard feelings between opponents of freeway signs, who 
say they spoil the scenery, and many of the business owners who have them. The 
opponents have tried to organize boycotts against the businesses that filed the 
suits, but apparently have met with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills City Atty. Greg Stepanicich could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Aran, the city argues that the state code deals with height and 
size restrictions. Therefore, Aran said, the state code does not apply in this 
case, because the city wants to remove the signs altogether, not regulate their 
size or height. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their position is illogical and renders the state's expressed policy 
meaningless," Aran said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms are Chevron, Unocal, Burger King, Texaco, Lumber City, Fence 
Factory, Roadside Lumber and Hardware, McDonald's, Denny's, Jack-in-the-Box, 
Horse Trailers International and a Mobil service station. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council Member Denis Weber said the ordinance is "a local-control issue" 
that has the support of most residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to take a stand that they all need to come down, and this is 
just the first step as far as I'm concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been heating up in other cities as well. In Calabasas, the 
Planning Commission recently ordered two businesses, Calabasas Mobil and Red 
Robin restaurant, to remove their pole signs within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs violate a city ordinance prohibiting signs taller than 60 feet, the 
commission ruled. The two were invited to apply for permits for 42-foot signs. 
</P>
<P>
 They have the right to appeal the Planning Commission's decision to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hard feelings, one recent case was settled amicably. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Agoura Hills officials announced an agreement with Shell Oil Co. in 
which the company would take down a 70-foot pole sign in exchange for permits 
to build a car wash and mini-mart. FRANK MANNING

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; BEREAL 
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF NAACP BRANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles (Buddy) Bereal, a 48-year-old youth worker, has been elected president 
of the Pasadena branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a counselor with Community Youth Gang Services, an anti-gang program 
operated by Los Angeles County, Bereal will head the 750-member NAACP branch 
for two years beginning in January.He received about 90% of the votes cast by 
members Sunday at the Jackie Robinson Center in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Pasadena city employee, Bereal in 1975 filed a discrimination lawsuit 
against the city that resulted in an overhaul of hiring policies, enabling more 
blacks and Latinos to gain entry level jobs in police, fire and skilled trades. 
In October, the city's police and fire departments were cited in an American 
Civil Liberties Union study as being the most ethnically and gender diverse in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena branch of the NAACP began in 1919. It has an office in the 
Japanese Cultural Institute in Pasadena and a yearly operating budget of nearly 
$100,000. It is one of 22,000 branches nationwide of the 85-year-old civil 
rights organization.

<P>
 A Chatsworth High School senior was shot in the leg near campus Monday 
afternoon in a failed carjacking attempt by three teen-agers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, Anthony Perea, 18, was shot once in the leg and is expected to 
recover from his injuries. He was treated and released from West Valley 
Hospital, said Lt. Kyle Jackson of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Perea was sitting in a friend's car when the robbers approached. He was shot 
after the robbers discovered that he did not have the security chip needed to 
turn off the car's anti-theft system. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher chased one of the assailants but both escaped.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PICO-UNION; TRANSIENTS' 
BID TO KEEP WARM SEEN AS CAUSE OF FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transients trying to keep warm apparently caused a fire Monday that gutted an 
otherwise vacant, four-story apartment building in the Pico-Union area.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 firefighters sent to the 400 block of South Union Drive about 
6:00 a.m. found the building engulfed in flames, said Jim Wells, a Los Angeles 
Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A plume of smoke could be seen for miles, and flames and flying embers 
threatened the roof of the apartment next door. But firefighters took up 
positions on the roof of that building and kept the flames from spreading, 
Wells said.

 A woman in her 20s apparently was in the building where the fire started. She 
suffered burns to her hands and was taken to a hospital. Wells said transients 
apparently started the "warming fire" that sparked the blaze.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: REDONDO BEACH; WOMAN, 2 
SONS CHARGED IN ALLEGED STAGED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman and her two sons, accused in the staged robbery of an armored truck in 
Redondo Beach, were each charged with five felony counts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraigned in South Bay Municipal Court were Maria Aracely Rivera-Cordero, 49, 
and her son, Luis Fernando Roca, 31, both of La Puente, and Jorge Mario Roca, 
28. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Roca and his mother are accused of being the gunman and getaway driver, 
respectively, in Wednesday's holdup in front of a Smith's Food King at 4001 
Marine Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 The younger Roca brother was the Brinks guard who was "robbed," prosecutors 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The mother and Luis Rocawere were arrested minutes later after being chased by 
an officer who was in the parking lot at the time of the heist.  
</P>
<P>
 Luis Roca allegedly walked up behind his brother as a cash delivery was being 
made, grabbed the younger man's gun and fired several shots as he fled in the 
getaway car driven by his mother.  
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Roca was arrested the next day after he reportedly told his employer the 
identity of the robbery suspects.  
</P>
<P>
 The three are charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit robbery, 
robbery, grand theft, shooting at an occupied motor vehicle and willfully 
evading a law enforcement officer.  
</P>
<P>
 It also was alleged that the robbery involved more than $150,000 and that a 
handgun was used during the commission of the crime. Bail was recommended at 
$250,000 for each defendant.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; OPENING OF GALLERY TO RAISE FUNDS FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of a new art gallery slated to open in Calabasas this weekend say 
they will donate 10% of the proceeds from the grand opening to a planned city 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Alexander and Raymond Hellen, operators of the Blue Moon Gallery, say 
they hope Saturday's event will raise $5,000 for Juan Bautista DeAnza Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That amount could go even much higher, depending on how many people show up, 
and what they buy," Alexander said. "The more we sell, the more the park will 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be various artworks on sale, ranging from pieces priced at a few 
hundred dollars, she said, to an original nude by artist Tom Wesselmann valued 
at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening will run from 6 p.m. to midnight at the gallery, 23504 
Calabasas Road in Old Town. Scheduled to attend the free event are artists 
Michael Bryan, Aldo Luongo, Susan Rios, Christina DeMusee, Tobias Keane, Linnea 
Pergola, Stephanie Farago and others, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be hors d'oeuvres and live entertainment by the Floyd Sneed 
Blues Band, said Alexander. Sneed is formerly of the rock group Three Dog 
Night. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Moon Gallery will showcase works by famous names as well as works by 
emerging artists, said Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 Original sculptures and paintings will be carried, along with limited edition 
serigraphs and lithographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get involved in charities, up in Santa Clarita, where I had a 
gallery for five years," she said. "I just like to get involved in charities 
that benefit the community. The park is ripe; it's ready. It needs funds and 
that's why we're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-million park is funded through a Los Angeles bond measure, Proposition 
A, which sets aside money to build parks, said Calabasas City Manager Chuck 
Cate. Any amount raised by the gallery would go to fund items not paid for 
through the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be used to enhance the park, and do something we hadn't planned on 
in the original budget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8 1/2-acre park, at the corner of Las Virgenes and Lost Hills roads, will 
be opened sometime next year, Cate said. It will include a recreation center, a 
conference room, office space and a kitchenette. There also will be a picnic 
area and barbecue pits that can accommodate as many as 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said she and her partner, who owned a gallery in Beverly Hills for 
seven years, chose Calabasas because they like the quaint character of Old 
Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love the feel," she said. "I didn't want to be in a strip mall." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice that people in the business community are willing to help out and 
do something nice for the community," said Greg Johnson, Calabasas' community 
services director. "We really appreciate it." FRANK MANNING

 Business and property owners in the Warner Center Assn. have pooled their 
recycling efforts, reducing their trash output by more than one-third over the 
last four years, leaders of the Woodland Hills group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closed-loop concept is taking your trash and recycling as much of it as 
possible and purchasing recycled goods as much as possible," said Brad 
Rosenheim, the association's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first four months of this year, association members have reduced their 
trash by 43% compared to 1990, according to the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans include increasing purchases of recycled products and looking into 
gray-water issues, according to Rosenheim. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; ANTI-COUNCIL GROUP HIRES A CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group trying to recall the entire Agoura Hills City Council has hired a 
consultant to help improve its effectiveness at gathering the signatures needed 
to force a recall election, the leader of the group said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Murphy said the consultant, whom she declined to name, was hired last 
week. She said that since then, recall proponents have gathered about 300 
signatures -- compared to about 1,600 over the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably had enough volunteers before, but we weren't using the right 
techniques," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant has provided three people experienced in recall elections, who 
have been coaching about a dozen volunteers, Murphy said. They were on hand 
last weekend as volunteers staffed booths at various spots around town. 
</P>
<P>
 The group needs 2,454 signatures -- or 20% of the city's registered voters -- 
by Dec. 7 to force a recall election, according to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Pavley, one of the council members targeted for recall, scoffed at hiring 
a consultant. Pavley said that someone who was staffing a booth last weekend at 
a shopping center asked her to sign the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't even know who I was," Pavley said. "This is not a grass-roots 
effort anymore. This is not local people who are upset with taxes. This is 
people who are paid to get you to sign that paper any way they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley and others have suggested that the recall is influenced by business 
people who are angry with the City Council over its support for an ordinance 
banning pole signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a little scary," said Dee Akemon, an avid supporter of the 
present five-member City Council. "We don't know who we are dealing with. I 
hear these people are from San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 But Murphy responded: "Of course, it's a grass-roots campaign. I've done what 
any good manager would do. If my job is to get enough signatures to get this on 
the ballot so people can vote, then that's what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's group -- Citizens Against New Local Taxes -- began the recall process 
last summer, after the City Council voted unanimously to pass a 4% tax on 
electricity, gas and telephone service to help close a budget gap of nearly $1 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 The group maintains that the city could have closed the deficit without the 
tax, and it accuses the council of allowing spending to spiral out of control. 
City Council members insist that the tax was necessary and that they have done 
all they can to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said that until last week her group was made up of volunteers who were 
inexperienced at running a recall campaign. Before the consultant was hired, 
the petition gatherers had gone to local shopping centers and the post office, 
where they set up booths "too far from the door," Murphy said. "We were not 
asking people to sign; now we're actively asking people to sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley said of the petition drive over the weekend: "All day, it was so hard 
to get into the market. It was easier to sign than to say no." FRANK MANNING

$8 MILLION RAISED FOR LAPD COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A private sector campaign to computerize the Los Angeles Police Department has 
raised $8 million of its $15-million target in three months, city officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A., a coalition of local business and civic 
leaders formed in August by Mayor Richard Riordan, Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams and the head of Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., Bruce Karatz, hopes to 
computerize the department, whose officers currently spend up to 40% of their 
day completing paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance hopes to start purchasing equipment as early as January.  
</P>
<P>
 The group on Monday also launched an 800 number -- (800) 4-SAFE-LA -- to 
encourage other businesses and individuals to contribute. The money is expected 
to buy 1,700 computer workstations as well as electronic mail and voice mail 
equipment for the department's 18 police stations, four traffic bureaus and 
administrative headquarters at Parker Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "The computers will save over 75% of (officers' paper processing) time," 
Riordan said in front of a 20-foot paper pyramid symbolizing the amount of 
paperwork processed by the LAPD each month. "Computers will add over 350 police 
officers to the streets of Los Angeles every day, doing community-based 
policing and making the city safer." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 major private donors included the Ahmanson Foundation, which gave $3 
million, and Blue Cross of California, which gave $1.5 million. Other donors of 
more than $100,000 were William Keck Jr., L.A. Cellular, Hollywood Leadership 
Alliance, Food 4 Less, Arco, Ticketmaster and Kaufman & Broad. The engineering 
giant Fluor Daniel has volunteered system design and project management 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 The alliance says its combined effort is expected to generate one of the 
largest private gifts ever to the LAPD.

ATTORNEY CALLS FLEISS A VICTIM; COURT: AS TRIAL BEGINS FOR ALLEGED 'MADAM TO 
THE STARS,' DEFENSE BLAMES POLICE STING FOR HER ARREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Heidi Fleiss, alleged "madam to the stars," was the victim of lying, overeager 
police officers pretending to speak Japanese who perpetrated a desperate sting 
operation, her attorney said during opening arguments Monday at her Superior 
Court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss was told a "cock-and-bull story" that was "shrewdly calculated by 
police to entice (her) into committing a criminal act when no act would have 
occurred otherwise," lawyer Donald Marks said during his 35-minute opening 
remarks on behalf of Fleiss, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of pandering 
and possession of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial kicked into gear with the playing of taped phone calls between 
Fleiss and undercover Beverly Hills police Detective Sammy Lee, in which Lee 
requested "entertainment" for other undercover police posing as businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter also played for jurors a scarcely audible 
videotape of Lee meeting Fleiss and alleged prostitute Peggy Schinke later to 
arrange for four women to visit his hotel suite. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the history of this business, in one year, no one has ever been able to do 
what I do," Fleiss is heard to say. "I know 1% of the wealthiest people . . . 
and of all the girls that I select that are gonna work for me, maybe I meet 100 
girls, maybe in two weeks and I only pick one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss arranged for four prostitutes, each of whom was to be paid $1,500, 
according to the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who called himself businessman Niko Akai, is heard on the tape asking, 
"And for $1,500 what are we talking?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss is heard to respond, "We're talking about everyone's gonna have a good 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the 28-year-old daughter of a prominent pediatrician faces up to 
11 years in prison. On Monday, Fleiss appeared in a conservative blue suit, 
trimmed with gold buttons. Though her parents and younger brother sat in the 
front row of the courtroom, Fleiss did not turn around. When court was 
adjourned, her mother, clad in black, wrapped her arms around her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 After her arrest in September after she tested positive for consuming 
stimulants and depressants in violation of probation, Fleiss has been assigned 
to a Pasadena-based drug rehab program. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' arrest for pandering last year set Los Angeles atwitter, mostly 
because of widespread speculation about her alleged clientele, which was said 
to include stars and studio executives. But for faithful followers of the 
Fleiss saga, the true denouement may not occur until January, when she and her 
father, pediatrician Paul Fleiss, are scheduled to go on trial on federal 
charges of money laundering, bank fraud and alleged conspiracy to conceal the 
young woman's income from her prostitution business. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys could try to unravel the trail of Fleiss' alleged clients, many of 
whom reportedly wrote checks to her from personal accounts.

PROP. 187 BACKERS PLAN RECALL CAMPAIGN; IMMIGRATION: ACTIVIST GROUP WILL TARGET 
L.A. SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE USING PUBLIC FUNDS TO TRY TO HALT 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEASURE. PANEL'S PRESIDENT SAYS OUSTER BID WILL FAIL.

 The California flag hangs upside-down in Glenn Spencer's hilltop home, the 
international SOS sign and the symbol, he says, of a state with its priorities 
topsy-turvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said last week's passage of Proposition 187 has given California a 
chance to survive -- by barring illegal immigrants from most government 
services. Passage of the initiative also culminates two years of effort that 
began on the patio of his Sherman Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where Spencer -- alarmed by what he said was a noticeable increase in 
the number of minorities in the city -- began a grass-roots movement against 
undocumented residents -- called Voice of Citizens Together. The group later 
joined with the so-called "save our state" campaign, with Spencer turning his 
home into the hub of the Proposition 187 drive in the San Fernando Valley. His 
home office has been a principal research center on illegal immigration, with 
volunteers answering phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said Monday that his group has a new goal -- to ensure that the 
initiative is implemented. The group, working with Proposition 187 campaign 
Chairman Ron Prince in Orange County, plans a recall drive against Los Angeles 
Board of Education members -- likely to include board President Mark Slavkin -- 
because of their efforts to challenge the measure using public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer is holding a meeting Thursday at Riverside Drive Elementary School in 
Sherman Oaks to discuss recall plans and other legal avenues to stop city and 
county officials from trying to block implementation of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration, said Spencer, 57, a semi-retired geothermal engineer, 
simply cannot continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who are flooding across our borders with a very high fertility 
rate and a very low educational level," he said. "We're exporting jobs and 
importing poverty. And unless something is done, this state has nothing to face 
but fiscal havoc." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, the son of a songwriter who co-wrote the theme to the television show 
"Gunsmoke" and the grandson of one of the members of the singing group Sons of 
the Pioneers, says the federal government should give illegal immigrants free 
transportation and a cash bonus if they return to their native countries. 
Illegal immigrant parents of children born in this country should be included 
as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials, who won a temporary injunction 
last week against the measure being implemented at schools, said the district 
could lose up to $650 million in federal funds if they are forced to question 
students' legal status. Under Proposition 187, schools would be required to 
verify the immigration status of students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they believe that any recall efforts will fail, and that 
Proposition 187 will be declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, I think that people will find that upholding the Constitution is 
not something for which people should be punished," Slavkin said. "People are 
in an angry mood and are looking for targets to vent their anger." 
</P>
<P>
 To get an election scheduled to oust board members, recall proponents must 
gather the signatures of 15% of the registered voters in the board district. 
Slavkin's district, which includes part of the west San Fernando Valley, has 
about 350,000 voters. Getting signatures, Spencer said, will not be a problem 
because of the groundswell of support shown by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, the Tustin accountant who ran the Proposition 187 campaign, said 
Spencer played an important role in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "His research has been very significant in informing the public about the 
problem of illegal immigration," Prince said. Spencer's group was key to 
gathering signatures that qualified the ballot initiative, and later, in 
campaigning for its passage, Prince added. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer formed Valley Citizens Together but the group changed its name after 
residents from other parts of Los Angeles wanted to be involved. Spencer said 
he counts about 2,000 members but admits that not all pay the group's $15 to 
$25 annual dues.

 Seminars for Spanish-speaking parents and counseling for high school students 
will be funded by two grants received by the Burbank-based Bridge Focus 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitecap Foundation has given Bridge Focus, which mainly serves the east 
San Fernando Valley, a grant of $9,738 for the Spanish-Speaking Parent 
Connection and children's group connected with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization also received $17,500 from federal Community Development 
Block Grant funds awarded to the city of Burbank. This money will be used for 
individual and group counseling for youths in Los Angeles County-run

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; DEMONSTRATORS OPPOSE QUAKE REPAIR DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 About 40 demonstrators, some waving signs, paraded in front of Los Angeles 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's field office on Ventura Boulevard on Monday, 
seeking to persuade the councilman to vote against a controversial proposal to 
create an emergency redevelopment area in the community.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will decide today whether to establish the Sherman Oaks 
redevelopment area, which would be the first such district in the San Fernando 
Valley. Five others in areas surrounding Northridge, Reseda, North Hollywood, 
Pacoima and East Hollywood will be reviewed by the council beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Epstein, co-chairman of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn.'s CRA study 
committee, presented Yaroslavsky aide Mark Spellman with a petition that 
Epstein said was signed by 2,500 Sherman Oaks residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week, it came out in the paper that Zev was leaning toward the 
(redevelopment area) because there has been no negative response from the 
community," Epstein said. "We went out this weekend and we got signatures." 
</P>
<P>
 Spellman accepted the thick sheaf of papers and said simply, "I'll get these 
to him today." 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Katz, Yaroslavsky's chief of staff, said the councilman had not made up 
his mind on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition "is a very important piece of information," Katz said. "I don't 
want to understate the significance of that many signatures." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz added that the redevelopment project could be a good tool to bring funds 
for rebuilding into the community. The Community Redevelopment Agency has 
proposed the $18.8-million, 900-acre project in Sherman Oaks as a way to 
rebuild quake-damaged buildings and to make infrastructure improvements. The 
money would come from the sale of bonds, to be repaid by increased tax revenues 
resulting from the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners said they took their petition drive door-to-door and to 
supermarkets.  
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners' group feels the proposal does not have adequate limits on the 
CRA's powers to condemn property and could allow too much money to be spent on 
street and sewer improvements at the expense of residential rebuilding.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce, however, supports the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Holme, who said he manages properties with a total of 1,500 units in 
Sherman Oaks, said that existing private and public funding sources can take 
care of the rebuilding that needs to be done, and that construction has already 
begun on many of the structures the CRA considers to be in need of help.  
</P>
<P>
 CRA officials said that as of Oct. 11 there were 800 damaged residential 
buildings, comprising 10,100 units, and 200 crumbled commercial buildings in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Holme, however, there are only 47 residential structures -- 
equaling 1,210 units -- and only five commercial buildings that have shown no 
signs of reconstruction activity. Proposed Redevelopment Area The Community 
Redevelopment Agency wants to create a 900-acre redevelopment zone in Sherman 
Oaks, one of the hardest-hit areas in the quake. A portion of local property 
taxes will be diverted to pay for reconstruction, new construction and public 
improvements. Source: Community Redevelopment AgencyKAY HWANGBO

 A canned-food drive at the Foothill Athletic Club is wrapping up its final 
week to help a program that feeds the homeless in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do this every year," said Rick Crews, manager of the club at 3831 Lowell 
Ave., La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive raises about 950 pounds of canned food each year. Club members and 
the general public drop off the cans in a bin just inside the club entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting full already," said Crews. Members who bring in five cans or 
more can bring a guest to the club free. The monthlong drive ends Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The donated food is given to the LIFE organization, which stands for "Love Is 
Feeding Everyone," Crews said. 
</P>
<P>
 The food drive is in its fifth year. ED BOND

 Organizers of a new Glendale support group for loved ones of those suffering 
from Alzheimer's disease are trying to ease the burden of the situation through 
sharing experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Group, which meets the first and third 
Thursdays of each month, is a forum for friends and relatives of Alzheimer's 
victims to talk about their troubles and feelings with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The symptoms of the (victim's) disease may cause the care-giving friend or 
relative to feel anxious, depressed and angry," said Steve Smith, a spokesman 
for the Glendale Family Service Assn., a nonprofit agency sponsoring the new 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is affiliated with the Los Angeles chapter of the Alzheimer's Assn. 
and is led by a licensed clinical social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions are free, although voluntary donations are accepted, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of Alzheimer's disease can suffer periodic or constant confusion, 
disorientation, memory loss, emotional outbursts, overly suspicious tendencies, 
hallucinations and poor judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2 million Americans over 65 are reportedly afflicted with the disease, 
the cause of which is unknown, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alzheimer's support group meets at the Glendale Family Service Assn. 
offices, 3436 N. Verdugo Road in Montrose. Information: (818) 248-2286. STEVE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; ZONING EXEMPTION TO END ON FEB. 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If they plan ahead a little bit, owners of buildings devastated by the 
Northridge earthquake could get a break from the city of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has announced a Feb. 28 cutoff date for owners of 
"non-conforming" residential buildings -- apartments, houses or condominiums 
located in areas that have since been rezoned -- to submit plans to rebuild 
their properties.If the owners submit their plans for approval by the city on 
or before that date, they can rebuild without being subject to current zoning 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule would allow the owner of a destroyed apartment building that exists 
in an area now zoned as commercial to rebuild the structure the way it was 
originally constructed. And the city is waiving the permit fees it charges to 
cover the cost of processing the paperwork, potentially saving developers 
thousands of dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double incentive to get people to rebuild," said Howard Miura, 
community development director for the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "The plans must be submitted by Feb. 28," Miura said, "because beginning March 
1, we go back to the current law -- no exceptions -- that says buildings must 
be rebuilt according to the zoning that exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-four residential buildings in San Fernando were more than 50% destroyed 
by the earthquake. Those contained about 171 apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Miura said there is one caveat: "The builder must be able to complete 85% of 
the construction by Sept. 1, 1995," to prevent developers from undertaking 
projects they can't finish. 
</P>
<P>
 If a building is left unfinished at that time, developers will be in violation 
of the zoning code and could be saddled with heavy city fines, officials said.

YOUTH SHOT NEAR HIGH SCHOOL; CRIME: STUDENT, 18, IS WOUNDED AFTER AN ATTEMPTED 
CARJACKING IS THWARTED. GUNSHOTS STARTLE THE CAMPUS, AND A TEACHER CHASES ONE 
OF THE TWO ASSAILANTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chatsworth High School senior was shot in the leg near campus Monday 
afternoon in a failed carjacking attempt by three teen-agers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, Anthony Perea, 18, was shot once in the left leg and is expected 
to recover from his injuries. He was treated and released from West Valley 
Hospital, said Lt. Kyle Jackson of the LAPD's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher chased one of the assailants but failed to capture him. 
</P>
<P>
 Perea was sitting in a friend's car in the 20800 block of Vintage Street just 
after 1 p.m., said Jackson, waiting for the car's owner to get out of class and 
give him a ride home. Two youths, about 16 or 17, armed with a handgun, ordered 
Perea out of the car, took the keys and jumped in, but could not start the car, 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Honda required a security chip -- part of the car's anti-theft system 
-- which the owner had, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perea turned to run away and was shot, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants ran, one west on Vintage Street and the second into an 
apartment complex at 20810 Vintage Street, police said. Police searched the 
building door to door but found no suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 A third person, waiting nearby in a Volkswagen, drove off as the carjacking 
failed, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of the shots echoed throughout the campus and disrupted some 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 John Apablasa, an English teacher, ran out of his classroom, which faces 
Vintage Street, and chased the robber he saw running into the apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Apablasa called out to the boy to stop, but the youth retorted "No way!" and 
kept running, the teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chased him, and he turned around and put his hand in his jacket like he had 
a gun," said Apablasa. "I said, 'Forget it' and let him go." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Sharon Smith said she did not know why Perea was out of 
class at 1 p.m., but said many seniors have shortened class days because they 
don't need the extra classes or they have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said counselors from the Los Angeles Unified School District will be on 
the campus today to talk to students who ask for counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will also have extra police that will surround the school," she said. "Not 
so much on campus as around it." 
</P>
<P>
 As sixth period ended, students poured out of their classes and milled around 
the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the gunshots from class, but I didn't know what it was," said 
15-year-old Taylor Bay. "Then we came out and saw all the cops." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a little scared," Bay said about the shooting. "Especially since I have 
to walk home today." 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Hayes, 17, said she has learned to live with the crime at her school. 
"It bothers me a lot, but you get hardened to it, I guess," she said as she 
watched investigators comb the street for cartridge casings. "That stuff just 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 When Kathy Belville arrived after the 2:25 p.m. bell to pick up her 
15-year-old daughter, she was startled to find police cars blocking the street. 
"I am worried," she said. "It's hard when you come to pick up your kid and you 
see this." 
</P>
<P>
 Belville said it was the second time she had come to pick up her child and 
found police investigating a shooting near the campus, referring to the 
shooting of a Chatsworth student last year over a backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is going on with this school? Every day it is something new," said an 
alarmed Holly Ghelichkani, who came to pick up her sophomore brother. "They 
should do something about the violence here."

CITY CLEANS UP YARD OF 'TRASH COLLECTOR'; MAN AMASSES TRUCKLOADS OF DEBRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Hyatt Martin not only didn't like to throw anything way, he apparently 
liked to collect other people's trash, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But when his collection of appliances, tires, lumber, newspapers and boxes of 
junk filled up his back yard and the inside of his house in the 11000 block of 
Hatteras Street, officials said, in effect, enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 City sanitation workers Monday were on their eighth day of hauling away 
truckloads of debris from the house, which with its peeling paint and bare-dirt 
front yard stands out in the otherwise quiet and tidy North Hollywood 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The haul is expected to reach 500 cubic yards by the time the cleanup is 
finished Wednesday. Among the trash -- which reached a height of eight to 10 
feet in the back yard -- were 300 gallons of paint that was still liquid and 
another 700 gallons that had dried. There were large items such as 
refrigerators with decaying food inside and small boxes containing broken 
pieces of rope and loose pieces of colored wires. 
</P>
<P>
 He even had six extra city-issued trash cans among the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Fire Inspector Michael A. Theule of the department's Bureau 
of Fire Prevention, who is overseeing the cleanup, said it was the third time 
since the mid-1980s that city officials have had to clean up Martin's house. He 
said city crews have also had to clean up 10 lots owned or controlled by 
Martin.  
</P>
<P>
 Theule said Martin told officials that friends dropped things off at the house 
and never retrieved them. The inspector said, though, there were indications 
that Martin collected trash others had discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Martin -- who could not be reached for comment and 
apparently does not live in the house -- previously served a jail sentence for 
failing to clean up the property.  
</P>
<P>
 Each time the city has cleaned up Martin's debris, Theule said, few items of 
value were found. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular case is unusual in that we usually find salvageable material 
among (other people's) junk," Theule said. "In this case, it was mostly trash 
and debris."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a friend of Martin's -- who was also present Monday salvaging what 
he could from the back yard -- said Martin's pack rat habits hurt no one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who cares why he was collecting it?" asked the man, who declined to give his 
name. "A man has a right to do what he wants on his property as long as he is 
not hurting anyone. If you don't have that right, then you don't own the 
property any more." 
</P>
<P>
 But Theule said the Fire Department sees Martin's hoard as a potential fire 
and health danger. "We killed six large rats and saw at least a dozen more 
scurry away," he said. "They have to go somewhere, and that will probably be 
someone else's yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Theule said that a court order declared the property a public nuisance and 
Martin was ordered to clean it up. But Martin did not comply, and so the city 
decided to clean it up for him and then bill him for the cost, which is 
expected to run $15,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges are expected, Theule said. 
</P>
<P>
 Theule said Martin has never given a reason for collecting the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Murphy, a staff psychiatrist at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, said 
many things can cause a person to hoard, including confusion, but it could also 
be caused by an obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, which he defined as "a 
repetition of thoughts or deeds which serves the purpose of keeping anxiety at 
bay." 
</P>
<P>
 "People with OCD have difficulty regulating the termination of behavior," he 
said. "Obsessive thoughts recur for no good reason. Individuals may find that 
they have a need to remain in possession of objects. It is anxiety-driven." 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, another high-profile pack rat case was in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court on Monday. Terry Knutson, 41, a professional clown known as "Clownzo," 
was sentenced to 180 days in County Jail for continuing to ignore a 1992 court 
order to fully clean up his North Hills property. 
</P>
<P>
 Knutson, who was immediately taken into custody, had already served an 
eight-month sentence last year for ignoring the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Don Cocek, who prosecuted Knutson, said that the difference 
between the Knutson and Martin cases is that Martin had been jailed before 
without much success in getting him to keep his property clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Martin, I felt there was no hope of having the court enforce the order 
so we went another avenue," Cocek said. "We have a lot of pack rat cases that 
get resolved because people don't want to go to jail. Mr. Knutson has chosen to 
go another way, but one way or another we are going to get his property cleaned 
up."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LITTER AND GRAFFITI ARE TARGETS OF VOLUNTEERS

 Volunteers bearing trash bags and paint brushes will descend upon a Canyon 
Country neighborhood Saturday for a cleanup sponsored by a local citizens 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Litter and graffiti are the targets at Canyon High School, Sierra Vista Junior 
High School, North Oaks Park and other areas around Whites Canyon Road. The 
event is organized by United Mothers of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The group formed two years ago and includes about 25 people who participate in 
community activities and try to foster better communication between local 
officials and Newhall's Hispanic community. Some members are involved in Santa 
Clarita's Anti-Gang Task Force and others help provide translation services for 
law enforcement here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided as one of our projects we want to pick a part of the city every 
three or four months and clean it up," said member Maria Fulkerson. "Our main 
purpose is to help out in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 At their last cleanup, organizers found themselves with the odd problem of 
having too little graffiti to keep 60 volunteers busy for a few hours. 
Participants resorted to planting trees, picking up litter and painting a flood 
control channel to cover mismatched paint blotches used to hide earlier 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Tonoian, who coordinates anti-graffiti efforts for the city, said 
Saturday's event doesn't mean vandalism has become more frequent in Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cleanup is more of a beautification effort in the Whites Canyon area 
than a graffiti cleanup," said Tonoian. "Graffiti is really a secondary issue 
for this event." 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals have caused about $65,000 in damage in 563 graffiti incidents between 
January and October, Tonoian said. Barring a flurry of illegal activity during 
the next month, Santa Clarita won't approach the $161,000 in damage caused in 
1,097 incidents during all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those numbers really speak for themselves," Tonoian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are scheduled to meet at 8 a.m. Saturday at the Boys and Girls Club 
at Sierra Vista Junior High School, 19425 Stillmore St.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEWHALL SCHOOL BOARD TO CONSIDER UNIFORM 
POLICY; EDUCATION: PANEL IS SCHEDULED TO DISCUSS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM, BUT THE 
EMPHASIS MAY SHIFT TO A MANDATORY PLAN.

<P>
 The Newhall School District Board of Trustees is scheduled to consider a 
voluntary student uniform program tonight, but some school administrators 
predict the board will recommend drafting a mandatory policy instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The district would be the second in Santa Clarita to adopt school uniforms, a 
concept gaining popularity in many areas statewide. The proposed policy would 
allow any of the district's six elementary schools to make uniforms an option 
for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. J. Michael McGrath said the order to draft the proposal was made before 
the state passed a law earlier this year allowing schools to require uniforms 
for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I read the board right I think they would be far more interested in a 
mandatory uniform policy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of more than 1,000 parents in the district indicates 74% favor 
uniforms, with 26% opposed, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of school uniforms say they focus children's attention on the 
classroom rather than fashion, make it easier to spot outsiders on campus and 
reduce campus violence by eliminating gang-type clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But optional uniforms would cancel out many of those benefits since some 
students would not be wearing them, said board President Gonzalo Freixes. In 
addition, many administrators said they have little gang activity to worry 
about in their elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at a school where we have very little of that, if any," said Wayne 
Abruzzo, principal of Valencia Valley Elementary School. "There are a few 
students (who dress in gang-style clothing), but it's limited more to style 
than to wanna-be gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 Freixes said he is a strong supporter of mandatory uniforms, arguing they will 
improve the learning environment even at schools where gang activity is 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also gets them used to the idea (of wearing uniforms) when they go to 
junior and senior high schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory uniforms were implemented for the first time in Santa Clarita this 
year at La Mesa Junior High School, where support from parents and school 
officials -- but not necessarily students -- has been overwhelming. 
Administrators of other Santa Clarita Valley school districts have said they 
are interested in requiring uniforms, especially if the program at La Mesa is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said he doesn't oppose mandatory uniforms but believes it will be a 
struggle to overcome court challenges by those who contend that such a 
requirement limits freedom of expression. Also, he said he doesn't believe 
uniforms will be as effective as some parents hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't stop the fact that there's gangs in the community," he said. 
"They're just not as easy to identify on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 The board meets at 7:30 p.m. at the district's board room, 25375 Orchard 
Village Road.

MOLESTATION DEFENDANT ACTING AS OWN LAWYER; COURTS: NURSE'S AIDE VICTOR SUMNER 
IS CROSS-EXAMINING WITNESSES HE IS ACCUSED OF FONDLING IN SIMI VALLEY HOSPITAL. 
</P>

<P>
 In a highly unusual sexual molestation trial in Simi Valley, the defendant has 
been allowed to function as his own lawyer -- putting him in position to 
revisit his alleged crimes with his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is he cross-examining them, but as defense counsel he has access to 
their phone numbers and addresses. One victim said Monday that she was 
frightened because when the alleged crime occurred, he threatened to track her 
down and molest her again. 
</P>
<P>
 Several family law experts and area social workers who counsel victims of 
sexual assault deplored the courtroom confrontation because of its potential 
effect on the victims, but conceded there were few options because of a 
defendant's right to function as his own lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very disturbing," said Patricia Phillips, a Los Angeles family 
attorney. "I would think it could be very intimidating for the victims to come 
forward and tell their story with the accuser standing there asking the 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of three victims in the case testified Monday that nurse's aide Victor 
Sumner fondled them while they were patients at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, a developmentally disabled 32-year-old, sternly reproached Sumner 
during his cross-examination when he asked why she had not leaned over and 
pushed him away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here about you," she said. "You're a mean man to ever do that to a girl 
who is in the hospital. Since you've done that I've been scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Sumner why she was scared, the woman, described in court as having 
the mental capacity of an 8- to 10-year-old, responded: "Because you said you 
were going to take down your pants and make me have a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The second woman, a 72-year-old who was so frail that she had to be wheeled 
into court on a hospital bed, also stood her ground during the examination from 
Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner quizzed her on her ability to remember the incident, and the woman 
responded by recounting the event in great detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to put this out of my mind," the woman said. "But I cannot forget 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 Experts who specialize in counseling sexual assault victims said Monday that 
facing the alleged assailant a second time may have been very traumatic for the 
women, even if they showed little emotion on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard enough to go through the trauma of an assault. I can't imagine how 
horrible it must be for them to face the perpetrator a second time," said Pam 
Cady, a counselor with the Ventura County Coalition Against Family and Sexual 
Violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite these risks, legal experts said Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Charles W. Campbell Jr. had little choice but to let Sumner represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any way around it," said Los Angeles attorney Gloria 
Allred. "He has the right to represent himself. But still, I think it raises 
serious questions because of the intimidation the victims may feel about coming 
forward to testify." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial originally was set for the Ventura County Hall of Justice in 
Ventura, but was ordered moved to the Simi Valley Courthouse last month because 
of the frail condition of two of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 During arguments last week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig tried to 
persuade Judge Campbell to at least prevent Sumner from gaining access to 
victims' phone numbers and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell said Sumner, as the person in charge of the case, had the right 
to all pertinent information.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MOTORCYCLIST IS KILLED AFTER LEAVING LOVE 
RIDE; ACCIDENT: LA PUENTE MAN DIES IN A CRASH ON A VAL VERDE ROAD AFTER THE 
CHARITY CONVOY. HIS WIFE IS CRITICALLY INJURED.

<P>
 A man leaving a fund-raising event that attracted more than 21,000 
motorcyclists was killed and his wife critically injured in a motorcycle 
accident Sunday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was one of three serious collisions involving participants in the 
Love Ride, the country's largest motorcycle charity ride. Two men were 
hospitalized with injuries during the ride from Glendale to Castaic and later a 
semitrailer truck overturned in Castaic while swerving to avoid some cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation in the ride, which raised more than $1 million this year for the 
Los Angeles chapter of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., has grown steadily during 
its 11-year existence, said Walter Moore, a promoter of the event. But he said 
there have generally been no serious traffic accidents as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the ride gets bigger and bigger I guess the potential increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal accident occurred about 4:10 p.m. when Michael Mendez, 37, of La 
Puente lost control of his motorcycle on Del Valle Road in Val Verde, said 
Officer Michelle Esposito of the California Highway Patrol. Mendez's wife, 
Irene Alarcon, 35, was a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was driving at an unknown, unsafe speed while entering a left-hand curve 
in the roadway," Esposito said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He failed to negotiate the curve and ran off the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez and Alarcon were thrown off the motorcycle, which landed in a ditch, 
Esposito said. Mendez, who was wearing a helmet that Esposito said did not meet 
federal Department of Transportation standards, was pronounced dead at the 
scene of massive head trauma and a broken neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, who was wearing an approved helmet, was brought by helicopter to 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia with a broken back and 
numerous other injuries, and was listed in critical condition Sunday night, 
Esposito said. Hospital officials said Monday that Alarcon does not want any 
further information about her condition released. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride started about 9:30 a.m., proceeding north along the Golden State 
Freeway to Castaic Lake. Two motorcycles crashed about 10 a.m. near Balboa 
Boulevard when traffic slowed due to an accident unrelated to the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sconyers, 42, of Pomona hit his brakes and swerved to the right, causing 
his cycle and another ridden by Peter May, 33, of Sherman Oaks to crash, 
Esposito said. Sconyers was taken to Henry Mayo with moderate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 May was taken to Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills with serious head 
injuries. He was upgraded Monday from critical to serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, a semitrailer truck overturned on the northbound side of 
the freeway near Lake Hughes Road in Castaic while trying to avoid motorcycles, 
Esposito said. No injuries were reported, but already congested traffic was 
further backed up as officials closed the three right lanes of the freeway for 
about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the Love Ride, most riding Harley-Davidsons, were told to ride 
slowly and stay in the second-from-the-left lane while on the freeway, in order 
to minimize the possibility of accidents, Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a few hot-rodders" when 21,000 cyclists hit the road, but most 
people he saw were riding safely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys I saw were going pretty slow, around 50 or 55 m.p.h.," Moore said. 
"Harleys are not race bikes."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SHUTTLE'S LANDING A BOOMING SUCCESS; AVIATION: 
ATLANTIS SETS DOWN AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE AFTER SENDING SHOCK WAVES THROUGH 
LOS ANGELES DURING ITS DESCENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A returning space shuttle set off twin sonic booms over Los Angeles early 
Monday, jolting residents whose nerves were already frayed by the Northridge 
earthquake and countless aftershocks this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The safe touchdown by Atlantis and its six-member crew was the third Southern 
California shuttle landing in three months, but the last two descents 
approached Edwards Air Force Base from the west and the north, so that the 
booms were barely heard in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Atlantis hurtled back to Earth from the south, passing directly 
over the Los Angeles Basin on its way to Edwards. It set off the twin booms 
about 7:30 a.m., while many residents were still swallowing their coffee and 
corn flakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that a sonic boom?" asked a puzzled Lori Farmer, 26, of Reseda.  
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up and I was like, was that an earthquake? I am so paranoid of 
earthquakes now, and I was thinking of my escape route." 
</P>
<P>
 Many were caught off guard by the thunder-like blasts because NASA officials, 
watching storm conditions in Florida, did not officially move the landing site 
to California until about 2 a.m. Monday. Some residents contacted Edwards to 
inquire about the noise or express their irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an idea that people are more sensitive to something like this because 
of the earthquake," said NASA spokesman Don Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 During a press conference Monday afternoon, the six astronauts chuckled when 
informed that some residents mistook their man-made booms for fresh Earth 
tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Lt. Col. Curtis Brown, the mission's pilot, said the shuttle was 
traveling three or four times the speed of sound -- or up to 2,800 m.p.h. -- 
when it passed over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic booms are created when a speeding aircraft pushes aside air molecules in 
its path, forming shock waves. The sharp release of pressure from these shock 
waves creates the boom. 
</P>
<P>
 All supersonic aircraft set off twin sonic booms, one at the nose and one at 
the tail. But when small military jets break the sound barrier, the booms 
follow one another so quickly that the people usually hear it as one sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Space shuttles, at 122 feet long, produce a gap of about one-half a second 
between the nose and tail sounds, resulting in the distinctive double booms 
familiar to residents of the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials said sonic booms sound louder in canyon areas, where the noise 
reverberates, and are more intense on days like Monday, when few clouds are 
present to muffle the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis pilot Brown said he was paying more attention to the sights outside 
his window than the sounds that his descent was creating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very great view of Los Angeles -- the downtown and the city itself, 
the marina and the harbors," he said. "I had a perfect view of the L.A. area." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, NASA designated the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as the primary 
landing site for its shuttles, with Edwards as the backup. But bad weather in 
Florida forced the agency to divert Discovery to Edwards on Sept. 20 and 
Endeavour to Edwards on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Landings at Edwards add about $1 million to the cost of each mission, NASA 
officials say, largely because the vessel must be ferried back to Florida atop 
a modified Boeing 747 jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's safe return by Atlantis marked the end of an 11-day scientific 
research mission in which the astronauts studied the Earth's atmosphere and the 
effects of low-gravity on developing rats. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute switch in landing sites provided little time for spectators to 
gather at the base, but more than 100 arrived at a viewing area. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first to sit in the bleachers were Fresno residents Kathleen Stecko 
and Alan Smith, who arrived at 5 a.m. Smith said he and Stecko had wanted to 
view a shuttle landing for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work always interfered," he said. "But this time we decided work wouldn't 
interfere. We played hooky."

DAUGHTER TAPS MOTHER TO HELP LEAD SRI LANKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In 1960, the Indian Ocean island known then as Ceylon entered global record 
books by giving itself the world's first elected female prime minister. On 
Monday, it topped itself when the new president, a woman, installed her mother 
as premier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and daughter, a governing combination unique in the modern world, 
hugged and wished each other long life as the saga of Sri Lanka's political 
first family -- one whose intrigue, tragedy and tears would rival any 
prime-time soap opera -- embarked on its latest episode. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the prime minister was the same: Sirimavo Bandaranaike, now 78 
and suffering physical impairment from arthritis and a stroke she had three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the younger of her two daughters, Chandrika Kumaratunga, took the 
oath of office to assume the presidency after a huge victory in national 
elections. The blowing of conch shells and the beating of drums heralded the 
inauguration of the fourth president of this West Virginia-size island republic 
near the Equator -- and its last, if the current holder of the office has her 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kumaratunga has promised to seek changes in the constitution to 
drastically prune the powers of her job by July to turn it into more of a 
ceremonial post. That presented her with a unique problem. The strong-willed 
woman who graduated from Paris' elite Institut des Etudes Politiques had become 
prime minister herself back in August when she led the left-leaning People's 
Alliance in elections for the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the 49-year-old Kumaratunga could not hold both high offices, she 
needed to appoint someone to the premiership who would hand that job back when 
the time came, and perhaps even swap it for the presidency, observers said. She 
settled upon her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have proposed and agreed to it," Kumaratunga told a news conference 
Saturday when asked if she and her mother would be in charge of the country. 
"Why, do you think it's nepotism?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bandaranaike, who was sworn in Monday at Temple Trees, the official residence 
of the prime minister, will take over a Cabinet that except for minor changes, 
is the same one her daughter headed, and in which she had served as minister 
without portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga, who had held the portfolios of finance, planning and ethnic 
affairs and integration, now picks up the defense minister's job as well, which 
is the president's by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga will remain ensconced at Temple Trees instead of occupying the 
official presidential residence, Sri Lankan officials told the United News of 
India agency. Bandaranaike, known throughout her country as simply "Mrs. B," 
will live at home in Colombo's fashionable Cinnamon Gardens, an indication of 
the mostly formal role she will almost certainly play. 
</P>
<P>
 The interaction of Sri Lanka's two most powerful governmental figures has been 
as tangled as the most complex of mother-daughter relationships. It took 
Bandaranaike some time to come to grips with being eclipsed by her daughter, 
say people who know the family well. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was initially not happy about it but had to accept the fact that her 
daughter is a more gifted politician," said one Colombo political observer who 
is close to both women. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she issued a statement of congratulations that indicated that she 
had learned to be content with the role of second fiddle. It must have been a 
bittersweet moment for the woman who made feminist history of sorts when, after 
the 1959 assassination of her husband, Prime Minister Solomon Bandaranaike, she 
became the first woman to become leader of a country by dint of democratic 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. B" served two terms in the 1960s and 1970s, and left a checkered legacy. 
T.D.S.A. Dissanayaka, author of a recent study of his nation's politics, noted 
that her "socialist frolics" led to such an acute shortage of foodstuffs and 
essential consumer goods that Sri Lanka, an island surrounded by salt water, 
actually had to import salt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Bandaranaike's party lost power, and 17 years of victimization and 
political harassment began for the former premier and people loyal to her. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother is still titular head of the People's Alliance coalition that 
returned to power in August, as well as of its backbone, the Sri Lanka Freedom 
Party (SLFP), which was founded by her late husband. Her daughter, officially, 
is her party deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bandaranaike's weakened and uncertain health and Kumaratunga's quiet but 
electrifying stump style caused, in effect, a reversal of roles. Kumaratunga 
also was able to checkmate her younger brother, Anura, 45, who had been the 
SLFP's national organizer but found his position weakened by his sister's 
first, and unexpected, victory, in elections for the provincial council in the 
Colombo area in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Anura quit the party in a huff to join the then-ruling United National Party, 
and the way was open for Kumaratunga's rapid ascent that culminated in her 
landslide election Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That victory and Kumaratunga's choice of her mother as head of government fit 
in comfortably with the subcontinent's tradition of democracy by dynasty, which 
often has a strong undercurrent of tragedy and bloodshed mixed in with it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pakistan, the daughter of an executed prime minister has become leader; in 
Bangladesh, a president's widow is head of government; and in India, a single 
family has produced three prime ministers: Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and 
Rajiv Gandhi.

GOP'S HOUSE TEAM BRASH, BRIGHT AND MOSTLY YOUNG

 Until this month, Rep. Jim Nussle (R-Iowa) was best known, if at all, as the 
junior lawmaker who put a paper bag over his head when he appeared on the House 
floor to accuse the Democrats of covering up the congressional banking scandal 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The bag is off now as the iconoclastic young conservative takes the reins of 
the Republican transition team charged by incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) with restructuring the House. 
</P>
<P>
 At 34 and awaiting his third term, Nussle is one of "Newt's lieutenants," a 
group of bright, brash and mostly young GOP conservatives whose names are about 
to become household words as leading members of the new GOP brain trust on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading this group as Gingrich's executive officer will be Rep. Dick Armey of 
Texas, the incoming majority leader whose taste for confrontation is surpassed 
only by his conservatism. "Dick doesn't lob hand grenades," one GOP colleague 
said recently. "He lobs atomic bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 But the group also includes a handful of lawmakers more diverse than the 
overarching conservatism that unites them would suggest. Among the new leading 
lights are Reps. Tom DeLay of Texas, Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, Bill 
McCollum of Florida, John A. Boehner of Ohio, David Dreier of San Dimas, 
Calif., and, in the category of elder statesman, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they have set themselves the ambitious task of not only steering the 
government sharply toward the right but also of reshaping the House in the 
hopes of widening the GOP's congressional beachhead for a 1996 assault on the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 In the battle to come, however, they must find a way of drawing strength from 
what is also the GOP's biggest vulnerability: the relative inexperience of most 
of its rank-and-file members. Fewer than half of the 231 Republicans who will 
serve in the House next year have been there for more than one term, and many 
newcomers have no government experience whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 While this lack of expertise could hamper the GOP's efforts to enact the major 
structural reforms it has promised in its "contract with America" legislative 
agenda, it could also work to the Republicans' advantage because many, if not 
most, of the party's rising stars owe their ascendancy to Gingrich's mentoring. 
Many incoming freshmen also received financial help in their campaigns from 
Gingrich, McCollum, DeLay and other party fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The freshman class's indebtedness to the new leadership, combined with the 
fact that we all know that we'll be out on our butts in two years if we don't 
deliver on our promises, means that Gingrich can probably count on more party 
loyalty than any Speaker before him in recent memory," a senior GOP House aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means that, as Gingrich's chief lieutenant, Armey will likely wield 
greater influence over the GOP rank and file than Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, the 
Democratic majority leader in the present Congress, was able to exercise over 
his foot soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Armey, 54, born in Cando, N.D., moves into the No. 2 House leadership position 
with a political and philosophical resume nearly identical to Gingrich's. Like 
the next Speaker, Armey stormed into politics from an academic background 
(Gingrich was a history professor and Armey an economics professor) and fought 
his way up the GOP ladder in fairly swift order by demonstrating a talent for 
partisan ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 Armey, author of the GOP's "contract with America," launched his House career 
10 years ago with a publicity stunt not unlike Nussle's. Arriving in Washington 
in 1984 as the newly elected representative from a Dallas-Ft. Worth district, 
he set up living quarters in the House gym until Democratic leaders evicted 
him. Armey said at the time that he did it to save money, but most saw it as a 
publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 If his style has mellowed somewhat since then, his rhetoric has not, and a 
moderate GOP lawmaker who was often rankled by Armey's confrontational style 
said it remains to be seen if the Texan can sufficiently temper his "instinct 
to shoot from the mouth" to be effective as majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Armey may be Gingrich's ideological twin, but he has "a tendency sometimes to 
blurt out things he hasn't quite thought through," added a GOP staffer 
diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Armey, for instance, who referred to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
last year as a Marxist and who was publicly scolded by Democrats for 
dismissively referring to Clinton during a floor debate as "your President." He 
apologized and said he had not meant to suggest that Clinton was not his 
President as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that he has been chastened by the onus of leadership, Armey 
indicated at a news conference Monday that he would follow Gingrich's lead in 
promising to work constructively with Democrats, who are now in a position to 
obstruct the GOP agenda like the Republicans did when they were in the 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get ahead while you're getting even . . . it's a waste of time," 
Armey said in promising that there would be no GOP vendetta against the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they can get ahead, however, the Republicans will have to decide the 
outcome of a fierce three-way race for majority whip, the No. 3 leadership 
position that is being sought by Walker, McCollum and DeLay. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought into the GOP leadership by Gingrich in 1989, Walker is clearly the 
Speaker-elect's first choice. A master tactician when it comes to using House 
rules, Walker "has always been one of Gingrich's most trusted mastiffs," noted 
Rutgers University political scientist Ross K. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker is a nine-term Republican from the deeply conservative Pennsylvania 
Dutch district of Lancaster. He used his knowledge of parliamentary tactics to 
help force disclosure of Democrats who had overdrawn their House bank accounts 
two years ago, and has been a constant thorn in the Democrats' side ever since. 
He often slowed down floor debates to protest the restrictive rules under which 
Democrats brought up bills to prevent Republicans from trying to amend them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many lawmakers think Walker will get the No. 3 spot, he faces a stiff 
challenge from McCollum and DeLay, both of whom were very active raising money 
for and dispensing advice to a number of GOP challengers in the last elections. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most prominent conservative standard-bearers for the GOP on 
national issues, the 50-year-old McCollum served last year as the party's main 
point man in the legislative battles over gun control, immigration and the 
savings-and-loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLay, now entering his sixth term, initially aligned himself with mainstream 
GOP leaders such as outgoing Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois. He 
backed a rival candidate when Gingrich sought the party whip post in 1989. He 
has repaired the rift, however, and his impeccably conservative credentials 
make him a natural ally for Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key player is certain to be Hyde, whose age, seniority and reputation 
as a traditionalist who respects the institution of Congress make him the 
"perfect counterweight" to all the "young Turks and barn burners" rising to the 
top. Hyde, 70, was first elected to Congress in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Midwesterner, he also brings geographic balance to a new leadership team 
otherwise dominated by Southerners, several GOP aides noted. More on Gingrich

NEWS ANALYSIS; END OF U.S. ARMS EMBARGO ADDS TO BOSNIA CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the three short days since the United States broke ranks with European 
allies and gave up enforcing a U.N. arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the Balkan conflict has dramatically escalated and the peace process has all 
but collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The abandonment of an embargo the U.S. government did not believe in may have 
been intended as a symbolic action to conform with an edict from the U.S. 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But that policy shift, combined with more openly expressed U.S. sympathies for 
the Bosnian and Croatian governments and with recent battlefield successes by 
Bosnia's beleaguered Muslim-led army, has provided the back draft to inflame 
the Balkan conflict and widen the gap between Washington and its European 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of European defense officials in the Dutch town of Noordwijk, 
concerned allies dispatched NATO Secretary General Willy Claes to Washington 
for emergency talks Wednesday concerning the widening differences within the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 France and Spain have warned that they may have to pull out their Bosnia-based 
peacekeepers if more arms get through as a consequence of the U.S. decision to 
no longer take part in a naval blockade along the Adriatic Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb rebels expressed their anger over the latest political and 
military setbacks by attacking the hotel in Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, that 
houses the U.S. Embassy and by blasting their way back into territory around 
the city of Bihac, scene of the first major victory scored by the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government in 32 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Serbs have joined the assault now threatening to vanquish the 
surrounded Bihac pocket -- a move that would unleash a refugee crisis of 
proportions yet unseen in four years of Balkan turmoil and rekindle the war 
between Serbs and Croats that has been simmering beneath a U.N.-imposed 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful of a catastrophic influx of refugees from teetering Bihac, the 
Croatian government has been contemplating military recourse to quell Serbs in 
the breakaway Krajina area, and a renegade Muslim group has also been 
conscripted for the intensifying showdown over Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very worried the conflict in Bihac could spill over the borders and 
lead to something unpredictable," said a U.N. official. "This could be the 
worst-case scenario for the whole region." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House decision to cease enforcing what was already a leaky embargo 
has emboldened the Bosnian government in its new and occasionally successful 
"octopus strategy" of waging numerous niggling offensives on widely scattered 
Serbian targets in order to tie down the heavily armed but demoralized rebel 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 By abandoning the embargo and entering into limited defense pacts with Croatia 
and Bosnia at this crucial moment, the U.S. Administration has also sent 
signals of support to the governments struggling to contend with Serbian 
occupation of their territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But the green light perceived by Sarajevo leaders for recovering land in the 
same way they lost it -- by force of arms -- could backfire on the government 
troops, as seen in the Bihac region over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb forces have recaptured virtually all of the territory around 
Bihac lost to the government offensive two weeks ago, said U.N. spokesman Thant 
Myint-U. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats here in the Croatian capital also cite intelligence sources 
as indicating that as many as 5,000 Bosnian Muslims loyal to deposed warlord 
Fikret Abdic have been moved toward the Bihac front lines from a refugee camp 
in the no-man's-land sandwiched between rebel Serbs and Croatian government 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fighting-age men, some already defeated by the Bosnian army when it 
quelled Abdic's revolt in August, join what the Zagreb government claims are at 
least 2,500 paramilitary Serb troops from Krajina already fighting in 
neighboring Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic appealed to Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman over the weekend to "take all necessary steps" to prevent the Krajina 
Serbs from attacking Bosnian territory -- an overture for collaboration being 
presented by the Croatian media in an unusually sympathetic light. 
</P>
<P>
 "What worries me is that the Croatian media have been preparing the public for 
any military action that might be contemplated," said one Western diplomat 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials confirmed that the Serbian onslaught continued Monday, and 
Bosnia's U.N. ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey, claimed that four rockets were 
fired on the town of Cazin, near Bihac, from Croatian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned about any possibility that a military solution might be 
pursued by the Croatian government," said Thant, the spokesman at U.N. 
Protection Force headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to avert a suddenly looming crisis, the U.S. ambassador to 
Croatia, Peter Galbraith, has been counseling caution and urging Zagreb to seek 
a peaceful resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 But Galbraith has also put Croatia's rebel Serbs on notice that they are 
risking self-destruction if they continue to wage war across an internationally 
recognized border. 
</P>
<P>
 "By being involved in Bosnia, the Krajina Serbs are not only jeopardizing the 
peace process, they are jeopardizing their own position," Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic hinted in a letter to U.N. officials at 
the "military option" his government is under pressure to take in the face of 
the concerted Serbian attacks on Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of Bihac, pledged by Bosnian Serb nationalist Radovan Karadzic, would 
inundate Croatia with as many as 200,000 more refugees and create such a huge 
and contiguous mass of Serb-held territory as to make it impossible for either 
Croatia or Bosnia ever to recover their Serb-conquered lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be utterly untenable for Croatia to have the Bihac pocket fall," a 
Western envoy said in assessing the likelihood of a preemptive Croatian 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 During an emergency session at U.N. headquarters in New York on Sunday, the 
Security Council denounced the Serbian onslaught and warned the Krajina rebels 
against further intervention in the Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, during a visit to London, 
characterized the Security Council statement as "meaningless" and called for 
NATO to spare civilian lives in Bihac by taking serious action to protect what 
has been designated a U.N.-protected "safe haven." 
</P>
<P>
 As the fighting has intensified, diplomatic efforts to resolve the Bosnian 
crisis have reached what even U.N. mediators admit is an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 A resumption of long-stalled talks between Zagreb and rebel Serbs was 
scheduled for today , but mediators were likewise pessimistic that any 
negotiated breakthrough can be achieved amid the escalated fighting.

SEC LAUNCHES PROBE OF NASDAQ TRADING ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday it is launching an 
extraordinary top-to-bottom review of the Nasdaq stock market, looking into 
allegations that its trading practices harm small investors and violate federal 
securities rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Nasdaq's parent, the Washington, D.C.-based National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, announced that it will form its own "select committee" of 
respected securities industry figures to conduct a wide-ranging reassessment of 
Nasdaq's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials said the federal agency's review is the first full-scale 
investigation of an entire major stock market's operation since an inquiry into 
the American Stock Exchange in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The steps follow disclosure last month of a Justice Department antitrust 
investigation of possible price fixing on Nasdaq and the publication of a 
series of stories in The Times that examined alleged unfair practices in the 
nation's busiest stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, investors' lawyers also have filed numerous class-action 
lawsuits alleging improprieties by Nasdaq market makers, the 510 dealer-firms 
-- linked together by a central computer system -- that stand ready to buy or 
sell specified Nasdaq stocks at publicly quoted prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In a short written statement, the SEC said it "is undertaking a review of the 
operation of the Nasdaq stock market and whether existing trading practices are 
fully consistent with SEC and National Assn. of Securities Dealers Inc. rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC usually does not publicly announce investigations, and the statement 
did not elaborate on the specific areas on which the inquiry will focus. 
</P>
<P>
 NASD President and Chief Executive Joseph R. Hardiman said in a statement of 
his own that the NASD is consulting with the SEC and will announce the members 
of its select committee after a meeting Friday of the organization's board of 
governors. The purpose of the committee is to "permit an independent review of 
the operation and regulatory oversight of Nasdaq," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews in recent months, Hardiman has strongly denied any deliberate 
wrongdoing by Nasdaq or the dealers. The NASD contends that Nasdaq's system of 
competing market makers offers all investors advantages over traditional stock 
exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, where a single firm handles all 
trading-floor transactions in a particular stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we believe that observers often misunderstand the operation of 
competing dealer markets (such as Nasdaq) and the benefits they provide 
investors, all market places must continuously strive to improve," Hardiman's 
statement Monday said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said one item on the NASD committee's agenda will be considering 
whether to name representatives of the investing public to the NASD's board for 
the first time. Currently, the board is made up almost entirely of people from 
market-making firms and other areas of the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardiman did not return calls seeking comment. But he told the Associated 
Press that the decision to appoint the committee followed more than a week of 
consultations between the NASD and the SEC. The appointment of the committee, 
he said, is intended to demonstrate to the SEC that "the NASD takes its 
regulatory responsibility seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Kimball, a spokeswoman for SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., declined 
to disclose any details of the SEC's review. But, she said, "recent (private) 
litigation as well as press reports and the growth of this market have led us 
to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq, home of such giant companies as Microsoft, Intel and MCI, as well as 
more than 4,800 other companies, this year for the first time surpassed the New 
York Stock Exchange in average daily trading volume. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Oct. 19 that the Justice Department's antitrust division 
was looking into possible collusion among Nasdaq market makers to maintain wide 
"spreads" in Nasdaq stocks. Spreads, essentially the market makers' profit 
margin, are the gap between the price at which market makers are willing to buy 
a stock and the higher price at which they are willing to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Oct. 20, The Times' series reported that Nasdaq market makers 
harassed fellow dealers who tried to cut the spreads. The stories also reported 
that Nasdaq operates as a two-tiered system in which public reporting of big 
trades is often delayed and market makers themselves and big institutional 
investors often are able to trade at better prices than small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 NASD officials deny the allegations of collusion and insist that the market is 
closely policed for fairness. Nasdaq Investigation

RULING REINSTATING PROFESSOR ACCUSED OF BIGOTRY SET ASIDE; SUPREME COURT: 
JUSTICES CITE DECISION GIVING BROADER POWER TO FIRE EMPLOYEES WHOSE COMMENTS 
PROVE DAMAGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, sending a signal Monday that the First Amendment does not 
shield public officials who make bigoted comments, overturned a ruling that 
reinstated a black studies professor who in a speech denounced "rich Jews" who 
"planned and plotted . . . the destruction of black people." 
</P>
<P>
 In a one-line order, the justices threw out a federal appeals court decision 
that required City College of New York to keep Prof. Leonard Jeffries as 
chairman of its black studies department. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they told a lower court to reconsider the Jeffries case under a high 
court ruling in May that gave public officials broader power to dismiss 
employees whose comments damage morale or disrupt the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case last May, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that under the First 
Amendment, "the government cannot restrict the speech of the public at large," 
but it can restrict the speech of its own employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone who is paid a salary so that she will contribute to an agency's 
effective operation . . . says things that detract from the agency's effective 
operation, the government employer must have some power to restrain her," 
O'Connor said in a ruling that upheld the firing of a nurse who griped about 
her supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Atty. Gen. Oliver Koppell praised the Supreme Court for recognizing 
"that universities should be permitted to weigh the impact of offensive and 
bigoted conduct of high-level administrators . . . and that they are not 
impotent in face of racism and anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling is the latest in a three-decade court struggle to define the 
First Amendment rights of public employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, the justices gave strong protection to free speech on "matters 
of public concern." For example, they ordered an Illinois school board in 1968 
to reinstate a teacher who had been fired for writing a letter to a newspaper 
that criticized the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 But more recently, a more conservative court has stressed that the free-speech 
rights of public employees must be balanced against the welfare of an agency or 
a school system. 
</P>
<P>
 If a public employee's speech causes "disruption," he or she can be dismissed, 
"even when the speech involved is on a matter of public concern," the justices 
said on May 31, ruling in Waters vs. Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffries gained attention for theorizing on the differences between "sun 
people" from Africa and "ice people" from Europe. According to Jeffries, blacks 
are superior physically and intellectually because they have more melanin 
pigment in their skin. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 20, 1991, he spoke at a black cultural festival in Albany, N.Y., in 
defense of a much-criticized "multicultural curriculum" for the New York public 
schools. He said the curriculum had suffered from an orchestrated attack by 
Jews such as "(Arthur) Schlesinger and (Albert) Shanker" and Columbia 
University professor Diane Ravitch, whom he called "a sophisticated Texas Jew." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffries also said the negative images of Africans were the result of "a 
conspiracy, planned and plotted and programmed out of Hollywood. . . . Russian 
Jewry had a particular control over the movies, and their financial partners, 
the Mafia, put together a system of destruction of black people." 
</P>
<P>
 When his speech was broadcast on a state-run cable television network, it 
prompted a sharp reaction, including a demand from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that 
university officials "take action or explain why they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Under mounting pressure, college officials announced that Jeffries' contract 
to chair the black studies department would not be renewed, although he 
retained his position as full professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffries then filed a lawsuit contending that the college's action had 
violated his First Amendment rights, and a jury agreed. It awarded him $360,000 
in punitive damages and a judge ordered his reinstatement as department 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision, although 
it ordered a new trial on the damages. Though his speech was "hateful and 
poisonous," the First Amendment's protection "extends to all speech on public 
matters, no matter how vulgar or misguided," the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koppell's plea to the Supreme Court in Harleston vs. Jeffries, 94-112, 
questioned "whether the First Amendment compels a university to retain, in a 
position of leadership, a person who has engaged in hate speech."

ITO'S TELEVISED INTERVIEW LANDS HIM IN CONTROVERSY; SIMPSON CASE: SOME QUESTION 
HIS JUDGMENT AFTER HE BLASTED MEDIA COVERAGE. NO ETHICAL RULES WERE VIOLATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who for weeks has threatened news 
organizations and sternly warned prospective jurors in the O.J. Simpson trial 
to avoid publicity about the case, was thrust into a controversy of his own 
making Monday when a jury candidate said she had seen an ad for a televised 
interview with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's brush with the pitfalls of celebrity came on a day when he 
delivered the defense another setback in its attempts to limit evidence against 
Simpson. Defense lawyers had argued that a June 15 break-in of Simpson's Ford 
Bronco while it was in a police garage broke the chain of custody governing 
evidence seized from it and that anything found in the vehicle after that 
should not be admissible against the football great. Simpson has pleaded not 
guilty to killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, who previously had ruled against defense efforts to suppress other items 
found in and on the Bronco, decided that the break-in and theft of two receipts 
did not constitute "concrete evidence of tampering." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did rule in favor of the defense on one point, however, saying that 
conclusions of a procedure known as Luminol testing -- in which 
glow-in-the-dark results can be dramatically displayed to a jury -- cannot be 
admitted by prosecutors to establish that stains in the car are blood unless 
other tests support that conclusion. The defense said Luminol tests are 
unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Before issuing his written ruling on the Bronco evidence, the judge got a 
glimpse of his newfound star status Monday as the quest resumed for alternates 
to sit on the jury. Asked whether she had seen news accounts about the case, 
the first prospective juror questioned told Ito she had been watching "Murder, 
She Wrote" on Sunday night when an advertisement aired promoting a five-part 
interview with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, who earlier dismissed prospective jurors for such passing media contact 
as watching a cartoon or a Barbara Stanwyck movie, allowed that jury candidate 
-- a 60-year-old woman who is a retired gas company worker from Norwalk -- to 
remain on the panel after she said she only saw the promo, not the interview 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito downplayed the publicity surrounding his interview, which television 
station KCBS-TV has aggressively advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's sweeps week," Ito said Monday, referring to the period in which 
stations compete against each other for ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview and the fallout from it focused attention Monday on Ito's 
conflicted relationship with the press corps covering the high-profile trial. 
Legal observers said Ito had violated no ethical rules by agreeing to the 
televised interview because he declined to discuss the Simpson case, but some 
criticized him nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview does not represent the first time Ito has spoken out since 
taking over the Simpson case; he granted a few newspaper interviews early in 
the proceedings. But the KCBS series contains the judge's most extensive public 
comments, and it comes after his sometimes vitriolic criticism of coverage of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the station's extensive marketing of the story has made it difficult 
to avoid, even for prospective jurors trying to steer clear of news about the 
case or its cast of characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The station said Ito only agreed to the interview after some hesitation and 
only after clearly stating that he would not address any issues involving the 
Simpson case. The first installment of the interview focused largely on Ito's 
parents, Japanese Americans who were confined to an internment camp during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some will say, 'Gee, isn't this terrific role modeling?' " said Myrna Raeder, 
a Southwestern University law professor. But, she added: "I do feel this 
queasiness about the judge having decided to do this. . . . It is troubling 
given the amount of hostility that the judge has shown to press coverage to 
become part of the publicity surrounding this case." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of legal experts echoed those sentiments, saying they were surprised 
by Ito's decision to grant the interview, especially in light of his comments 
about publicity in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge hasn't done anything unethical or anything like that," said Laurie 
Levenson, a Loyola University law school professor. "But in this case, where he 
has cautioned jurors about the coverage and has been highly critical of the 
media, I think some people will be puzzled to see him agree to be part of that 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, a noted criminal defense attorney, was even more critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," he said. "Here he is complaining about the media becoming 
too sensational, and now he's part of it. . . . Here's a guy who's critical of 
frivolous press. What does he think this is?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very desirable for judges to do this type of thing," he said. 
"It demystifies them. . . . This does a wonderful job at showing Judge Ito as a 
human being, as a thoughtful, intelligent and compassionate person." 
</P>
<P>
 In orders and comments from the bench, Ito has regularly excoriated the news 
media and lamented the damage that publicity has threatened to cause in 
conducting a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 12 order denying news organizations' requests to view crime scene 
photographs, he derided "glaring examples of rank rumor and speculation, 
prurient sensationalism and outright fabrication that are the result of 
competitive commercial journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Ito has repeatedly criticized news reports and other media 
developments. Among other things, he threatened to take away a newspaper's 
courtroom pass and to pull the plug on courtroom television coverage, although 
he relented. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, when a sensational book detailing Nicole Simpson's final months 
was released, the judge halted jury selection for two days and ordered 
prospective jurors to avoid all media and to stay out of bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to smack of hypocrisy for a judge to complain not only about 
inaccurate coverage of the Simpson case but also about unduly extensive 
coverage, and then contribute to that coverage," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA 
law professor. "It creates a bad appearance." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito has complained about the extent of the coverage -- at one point, 
he noted in court that the case has received attention as far away as Nepal -- 
he has saved his most angry rhetoric for media mistakes. In denouncing an 
inaccurate KNBC report on DNA evidence, Ito thundered from the bench that he 
was "saturated by the irresponsibility of the media." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito granted the interview to the station that last summer broadcast a story 
falsely accusing Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark of wandering Simpson's estate 
before a search warrant was served for that property. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's handling of the Simpson case has won him high marks from many legal 
commentators, but several were especially surprised at his decision to grant 
the KCBS interview in light of the judge's previous comments about how judges 
should conduct themselves in high-publicity trials. Ito, who presided over the 
Charles H Keating Jr. case, is well-known for three maxims he composed for 
himself about handling cases in the glare of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 1: "Be cautious, be careful and when in doubt, keep your mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 2: "When tempted to say something, take a deep breath and refer to Rule 
1." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 3: "The sirens of mythology pale in comparison to the allure of seeing 
yourself on CNN. The results, however, can be about the same."

U.S. WEIGHS NEW ARMS SALES POLICY; DEFENSE: SUPPORT FOR CONTRACTORS AND STATE 
OF ECONOMY WOULD BECOME FACTORS IN APPROVING EXPORTS. SOME DECRY PLAN FOR 
GIVING GREEN LIGHT TO DEALERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a victory for the defense industry, the Clinton Administration is preparing 
to adopt policy guidelines that would factor the financial health of U.S. 
weapon makers and the shape of the domestic economy into decisions on foreign 
arms sales, Administration officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms sales abroad require government approval, and historically those 
decisions have been judged by whether the sale enhances U.S. security, regional 
stability and international cooperation. But the new guidelines would require 
the government to also consider whether a deal helps support U.S. defense 
contractors and maintains high-paying American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. defense spending continues its downward spiral, the Pentagon is unable 
to fully support its military industrial complex, and exports are being counted 
on for about 25% of contractors' future revenue. Over the next two years, for 
example, about half of U.S. jet fighter production will be exported. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft order is awaiting President Clinton's signature, pending White House 
and Cabinet-level decisions on several unresolved issues, including whether to 
approve a financing mechanism that would provide as much as $1 billion for the 
industry to promote foreign weapon sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Cabinet must also decide whether the policy would include language 
that advocates restraint in arms trading on certain types of weapons and which 
nations would come under those restraints, a White House official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts are troubled by the proposed policy, saying that making economics 
part of the equation will not only encourage more U.S. arms exports, but it 
will also make it difficult for U.S. officials to ask other nations to restrain 
their own deal-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be very lucrative for us," said Kenneth Watman, a senior researcher 
at the RAND Corp. think tank in Santa Monica. "By this policy, the U.S. will 
also give a green light to other weapon sellers in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joel Johnson, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace 
Industries Assn., a Washington trade group, defended the legitimacy of large 
U.S. arms exports. They have helped promote international stability in such 
areas as the Middle East, he said, and have cushioned the blow of declining 
defense spending on U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine years out of 10 we are the merchants of death, and then the next year we 
are the arsenal of democracy," Johnson said. "I would feel more guilty selling 
sugarcoated breakfast cereal to kids than selling weapons to democratic 
nations." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed guidelines follow a review of the issue that began a year ago. 
The policy, known as a presidential decision directive, has been delayed, but a 
White House official said Monday: "Hopefully, it will be soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospective policy would make explicit what has been an increasing trend 
of federal officials -- from ambassadors to presidents -- promoting U.S. arms 
sales around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent deals mark a significant departure from U.S. history. In the 1930s and 
1940s, the United States began exporting weapons for the first time to stop 
Adolf Hitler. During the Cold War, arms transfers were based almost entirely on 
the ideological and political battle against communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many experts predicted arms sales would decline after the Cold War, 
U.S. sales have gone up sharply because the world is less stable and Russian 
sales have dropped. The Persian Gulf War also provided a crucial proving ground 
for sophisticated U.S. systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftermath of the Gulf War also opened a huge market in the Middle East, 
stretching from Turkey to Egypt. And restraints against certain weapon exports 
to such countries as Taiwan were lifted. Meanwhile, the United States refused 
to sell to so-called rogue states -- basically Iraq, Iran, Libya and North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, U.S. defense firms have come to dominate the worldwide arms 
market, now accounting for 55% to 80% of international arms transfers, 
according to various estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. jet fighters, tanks, missiles and radars are widely regarded as the best 
in the world and have attracted loyal customers. Such major programs as the 
Lockheed F-16 jet fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 fighter and the General 
Dynamics M-1A1 tank will be kept alive by future exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of our security is our ability to produce certain weapons," Johnson 
said. Keeping production lines going with exports is "a security consideration 
we have never had to make before." 
</P>
<P>
 Arms deals fluctuate each year, though the general trend appears strongly 
upward. In fiscal 1993, U.S. firms signed agreements for a record $33.2 billion 
in arms exports, but the amount declined in fiscal 1994 to $12.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years preceding the end of the Cold War, the United States agreed 
to sales of $28.2 billion. In the three years after the Cold War, the sales 
shot up to $70.2 billion, according to William Keller, an analyst at the Office 
of Technology Assessment and the author of an upcoming book on the conventional 
arms trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy under consideration is part of a much broader thrust by the Clinton 
Administration to integrate the defense industry into the commercial economy by 
dropping complex military specifications, streamlining defense procurement 
rules and investing in research that can be applied to both military and 
commercial products, Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes could lead to globalizing the defense industry, taking it in the 
same direction as multinational corporations in other industries, Keller added. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms deals are also part of broader coordination between the United States and 
key allies, as well as an effort to more rapidly respond to crises around the 
world -- a trend that is difficult to counter, said Lora Lumpe, an arms trade 
expert at the Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the proposed guidelines raise economic considerations as only one 
ingredient in the decision to sell weapons, it is bound to be a potent part of 
the mix, Lumpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumpe noted that economic considerations appeared to dominate the decision to 
sell Taiwan the F-16 jet fighter and Saudi Arabia the F-15. More recently, some 
defense firms cited the potential for foreign business in promoting 
next-generation weapons, she said.

COLUMN ONE; RELIEF NOW RWANDA'S NIGHTMARE; DISTRIBUTION OF AID HAS BEEN

TO LEAVE OUT OF FEAR OR FRUSTRATION OVER HELPING THOSE ACCUSED OF SLAUGHTERING 
TUTSIS.

<P>
 Purple wildflowers and weeds now shroud the unmarked mass graves. The once 
grisly dump trucks cart mounds of garbage, not corpses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh water gushes from countless taps, and the rain-washed air is clean and 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulances rush the sick to some of Africa's best-equipped hospitals, where 
they are treated by experts from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And at last count, 976 rickety bars and brothels, plus hundreds of shops and 
restaurants -- not to mention a tiny thatch hotel named Amizero, or Hope -- do 
a brisk trade in the giant refugee camps. There is even a volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months after the world watched in horror as an estimated 50,000 
Rwandan refugees collapsed and died in miserable camps on the bleak volcanic 
moonscape here, frustrated U.N. officials and relief workers say the largest, 
fastest international relief effort in history has become a new kind of 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concerns range from massive theft of donated food and other relief 
goods, to death threats against U.N. field officers and aid workers, to daily 
political assassinations and other murders in the three largest camps. They 
also cite major environmental damage to the adjoining National Park of Virunga, 
Africa's first wildlife park and a critical sanctuary of the rare mountain 
gorilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most disturbing of all, humanitarian groups now openly acknowledge 
that the distribution of relief supplies to the estimated 750,000 Hutu refugees 
has come under the direct control of former Hutu government leaders and 
militias -- the same extremists accused of systematically slaughtering at least 
half a million Tutsi civilians inside Rwanda before they fled here in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "The militias and the military totally control the camps," said Samantha 
Bolton, spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders, one of the most active of the 
85 aid groups here. "They control all aspects of camp life. And the refugees 
are prisoners, are hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous," she said. "It's gotten to the point where we're aiding and 
abetting the perpetrators of genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 The ethical questions and misgivings have grown so severe that 16 
international aid groups have publicly threatened to withdraw assistance from 
the refugee camps unless security is assured and the former Rwandan authorities 
and their henchmen are removed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Nov. 3 statement, the groups -- which include Doctors Without Borders, 
CARE, Oxfam and the American Refugee Committee -- warned that "current relief 
operations are untenable" and working conditions are "unacceptably dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which coordinates the 
relief effort, separately "expressed grave concern" about "the threatening 
presence and activities of former Rwandese army, militia and civilian leaders 
in the camps." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming impossible to conduct the operation successfully," agreed 
Penelope Lewis, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, which provides 
most of the food for the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said after a crisis 
meeting in Geneva last Tuesday that he will ask the Security Council to send 
peacekeeping troops to eastern Zaire to provide security. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. officials here say privately that they don't expect such help soon, 
if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Several relief groups already have pulled out or sharply curtailed their aid. 
</P>
<P>
 CARE Canada, for example, evacuated all staff and officially withdrew on Oct. 
30 from the largest camp, Katale, after receiving two anonymous letters that 
threatened five staff members by name. 
</P>
<P>
 CARE had been in charge of food distribution, sanitation, social services, 
road building and camp management at Katale since the first destitute refugees 
arrived in late July. The camp now has about 230,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, with cholera raging and thousands dying daily, relief agencies gave 
little thought to who controlled the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jean Lapierre, CARE's coordinator, said security quickly deteriorated as 
the emergency abated. And in late September, he said, fighting broke out 
between rival gangs known as the Bandits and the Scouts. Many of the Scouts had 
worked as an unofficial police force for CARE. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really like the Bloods and the Crips, fighting for turf," Lapierre 
said. The two-day gang war ended with the disappearance, and presumed deaths, 
of 30 Scouts. At that point, the U.N. refugee agency and most private aid 
groups temporarily pulled out. All except CARE have returned. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bandits' reign at Katale was short-lived. Leaders of the Hutu 
government in exile quickly asserted control in the camp and created a sinister 
security force called La Jeunesse, or The Youth, to enforce their edicts. 
Working in groups of 20, the young toughs patrol the camp's 11 zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth are all believed to be former members of the Interahamwe, the 
government-run civilian militias implicated in the worst of the anti-Tutsi 
massacres. Francois Karera, a suspected Interahamwe leader, is the de facto 
leader of Katale and head of refugee food distribution. He is also one of 
Rwanda's most-wanted war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The new leaders demanded complete control of distribution of relief goods, 
even the blankets, plastic sheeting and other non-food items that were given to 
"vulnerables" -- the aged, pregnant women, children and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prefecture leaders came to us and said, 'We'll decide who will receive 
these from now on,' " one official said. "They wanted everything done their 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The aid groups refused, and U.N. officials estimate that 30% to 50% of the 
refugees now don't get enough food or other assistance. Aid workers fear the 
food is given to the estimated 30,000 Rwandan soldiers who are regrouping and 
retraining in nearby forests, or is being sold to buy arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down the road from Katale, for example, the black market at Rubare is 
bustling. Stalls are stacked with four-quart cans of refined vegetable oil and 
bulging sacks of corn and flour, all clearly marked "USA -- Not to be Sold or 
Exchanged." 
</P>
<P>
 On sale nearby are heaps of gray blankets, cooking utensils, red and white 
plastic buckets, high-protein biscuits and other relief goods sent by the World 
Food Program, the European Community Humanitarian Office, Switzerland and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The diversion of food has led to a dramatic increase in malnutrition in the 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicola Dahrendorf, acting director of the U.N. refugee agency here, said the 
number of children treated for severe malnutrition has doubled in the last six 
weeks. In Mugunga, the third-largest and one of the most chaotic camps, a 
recent U.N. survey found 14% of the population suffered from acute 
malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations still doesn't know how many refugees are here. Refugee 
leaders insist 2 million Rwandans are in the camps. Aid officials say the real 
figure is about 750,000 or fewer, based on visits to clinics, water consumption 
and other indicators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never been able to do a proper registration of refugees . . . because 
so many of our people were being threatened," Dahrendorf said. She said refugee 
leaders "inflate the figures" to get more food and to discredit the current 
Kigali government. They say the government cannot be legitimate if so many 
Rwandans live outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahrendorf, a human rights lawyer, wrestles with the moral dilemma of how to 
aid an impoverished refugee population led by accused mass murderers. She 
compares it to the international relief effort that provided crucial aid to Pol 
Pot's murderous Khmer Rouge in the early 1980s after they were forced from 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shut our eyes to that," she said. "And we're shutting our eyes here. 
There's no doubt we're strengthening them." She cited unconfirmed U.N. reports 
that the defeated Rwandan army is recruiting in the camps, "especially among 
children," so it can resume the war. 
</P>
<P>
 But she called it "complete hypocrisy" for humanitarian groups or governments 
to consider abandoning the tens of thousands of innocent refugees because of 
their leaders. "You don't start a major relief operation and then say, 'Oops, 
we're feeding the wrong people,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she said the three main camps must be broken into satellite camps, a 
change that refugee leaders steadfastly refuse to consider. "You can't leave 
the camps as they are," Dahrendorf said. "They're too overcrowded, too 
explosive, too volatile. They're impossible to control." 
</P>
<P>
 The environment is already a victim. An internal U.N. report this month found 
that the refugees were having a "significant and very negative impact" on the 
once-remote Virunga national park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is now in 
walking distance of the majority of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, the report found, 30,000 to 40,000 refugees cut hundreds of tons of 
wood from the park for fires and construction. The deforestation, as well as 
poaching and improper dumping of waste, threatens the gorillas, chimpanzees and 
other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials -- and the new Tutsi-led government in Rwanda -- say the 
obvious solution is for the refugees to go home. But with reports growing of 
reprisal killings of refugees inside Rwanda, the U.N. refugee agency no longer 
actively assists in repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the agency says 140,000 refugees have slipped out of the camps, 
mostly at night, and crossed the border since September. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers don't stay in the camps overnight. Often they find corpses when 
they return in the morning, victims of political killings or vendettas. On 
average, 20 people are hacked, stabbed or shot to death each week, sometimes in 
massacres of entire families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think terror reigns in the camps at night," said Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman 
for the U.N. refugee agency. "There is banditry, there is thuggery and there is 
organized intimidation by militias." 
</P>
<P>
 Katale's Hutu leaders blame all violence on "infiltrators" from the victorious 
Tutsi-led government that now controls their homeland. Indeed, Juvenal 
Mbunimpa, the head of refugees from Gitarama prefecture, accuses "some white 
men" in the relief agencies of secretly fomenting violence on behalf of the 
Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 But a more accurate reflection of the camps' grim reality came at a Doctors 
Without Borders clinic at Kibumba, the second-largest camp, earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses say a refugee accused of being an "infiltrator" ran into the 
compound at midafternoon, pleading for refuge. A mob of young men chased after 
him. Despite pleas from the horrified Rwandan staff -- and in view of a passing 
U.N. vehicle -- the man was dragged outside and hacked to death with machetes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was impossible to stop," said Marcello Tenti, an Italian logistics officer 
for Doctors Without Borders, who was nearby. "There was nothing anyone could do 
to stop it."

GUNMAN SLAIN IN SAN FRANCISCO SHOOTOUT HAD ISSUED WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drifter who died in a fierce, 25-minute gun battle that also claimed the 
life of a police officer had warned his family in the days before the rampage: 
"You're going to be surprised at what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing fatigues and a bulletproof vest, 37-year-old Vic Lee Boutwell hijacked 
two cars and sprayed a quiet neighborhood with more than 100 rounds from four 
weapons Sunday night. Holding off scores of officers, he shot out restaurant 
windows, pierced a gas line and hit a seventh-floor window in a hotel blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutwell, who was identified as a drifter who lived in his van in the Santa 
Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco, eventually was shot to death by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer James Guelff, 40, a highly decorated 10-year police veteran, died 
Monday at a hospital after he was shot in the head by the gunman, Police Chief 
Anthony Ribera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer John Payne, 42, who was shot in the chest, was in stable condition 
Monday. Paramedic Melani Brandon was shot in the arm when she tried to help 
Guelff, police said. A civilian, Robert Pinckney, 34, was shot in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Monday displayed the array of weapons that Boutwell was carrying, 
including two assault rifles and three handguns. They also showed a 
bloodstained bulletproof vest worn by the gunman. Boutwell had a camouflaged 
military helmet with him and was carrying about 1,000 rounds of ammunition, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a fascination with weapons," Inspector Alex Fagan told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Boutwell had attended gun shows and knew a lot about guns. 
Investigators said he had been interested in mercenary and military-type 
magazines and weapons. Boutwell also had fuses and black powder but left no 
clues what he planned to do with them, Ribera said. Police found a scanner and 
notebook with police frequencies written in it, but no other notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not know the motive for the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 But Inspector Tom Walsh said Boutwell told a relative last week: "You're going 
to be surprised at what I am going to do," and a family member told police that 
he believed Boutwell was suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootout began after Boutwell carried out a series of carjackings, Fagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutwell first stole a Lexus car in Mountain View, 30 miles south of San 
Francisco, Sunday afternoon. He failed in two other carjacking attempts before 
stealing a BMW in San Francisco, Fagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At gunpoint, Boutwell ordered two passersby to help him transfer satchels from 
the Lexus to the BMW, Fagan said. Pinckney was shot during a struggle with the 
gunman. Police quickly arrived at the scene and the gun battle erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Early news accounts stating that two gunmen were involved proved inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutwell raked the streets with gunfire, hitting buildings and vehicles, 
before police shot and killed him. During the rampage, Boutwell even fired at 
cars passing blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Dutton was eating at the Gourmet Carousel when shots riddled the 
plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were bullets going off all over the place," he said. "Everybody dove on 
the ground, but only after a couple of minutes. It sounded like firecrackers, 
like caps." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutwell's fascination with guns was not new, Walsh said. In 1988, San Jose 
police confiscated weapons from his home and arrested him. After that arrest, 
Boutwell moved out of his family home. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been living out of his van for six years, the inspector said.

WILLIE BROWN CALLS SESSION AS GRIP ON ASSEMBLY WEAKENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN and JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 As Assembly Speaker Willie Brown saw his Democratic majority slip away Monday, 
he took the unprecedented step of calling the Assembly back into session for 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown (D-San Francisco), the longest-reigning Speaker in state history, was 
cryptic about the purpose of the session, saying only that it was being held to 
sort out rules by which the Assembly would operate in the event of a 40-40 
split between Republicans and Democrats in the 80-member house. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation was rife in the Capitol that Brown will attempt a political 
maneuver to keep himself in power next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Assembly elected last Tuesday will not be sworn in until Dec. 5, 
meaning that for now, Democrats retain a majority of 47 seats, to 33 for 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Brown might try to use that majority to ensure that Democrats retain 
influence, his scheme could be undone by the Rule of 41, which he invoked so 
effectively during his 14 years as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 That rule says simply that whoever gets 41 votes, a majority in the Assembly, 
controls the day. While Brown's partisans clung to hope that he could somehow 
hang onto power, Democrats now appear to have lost the Assembly for the first 
time since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rule of 41 dictates where and what and whom," said outgoing Assemblyman 
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who was elected to the Senate. "It's going to 
be very difficult for Democrats to do anything other than assume there will be 
41 Republicans running the house." 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, Brown's hope of holding a Democratic majority all but 
disappeared as Republican Assembly candidate Steve Kuykendall edged ahead of 
Democratic incumbent Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) by 476 votes as counting of 
absentee ballots continued. She had been ahead by 64 votes on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 While the vote totals in a few other Assembly races around the state remained 
in doubt pending the count of absentee ballots, the results were not expected 
to cut into the Republican lead. With Kuykendall ahead, the GOP would hold a 
41-39 majority, apparently dooming Brown and opening the way for a Republican 
Speaker, most likely Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall received $125,000 from tobacco giant Philip Morris USA in the 
closing days of the election. Monday, however, Kuykendall said he is "not a 
friend of tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall said the cigarette manufacturer, which was hit hard when the 
Legislature earlier this year approved a statewide smoking ban, probably 
"wanted Willie Brown gone as Speaker -- they wanted a better business 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker, one of the most powerful posts in state government, selects 
Assembly committee chairs and thus shapes policy on everything from the state 
budget to farming to gambling. The Speaker also can raise large campaign 
donations from businesses and others with interests before the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In calling for Thursday's session, Brown broke with tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 In years past, the Legislature has gone out of session in August or September 
and not reconvened until early December, when new members are given the oath of 
office. Assembly Clerk E. Dotson Wilson said records show that one house of the 
Legislature never has been called back under such circumstances, "but there is 
nothing in the rules that prohibits it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte called Brown on Monday to determine the point of Thursday's session. At 
the time, absentee ballots in the Karnette-Kuykendall race had yet to be 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown told Brulte that he wanted the Assembly to adopt rules allowing the it 
to operate in the event of a 40-40 split, said Phil Perry, Brulte's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that Ms. Karnette has been turned out of office, and Mr. Kuykendall 
will be coming to Sacramento, we don't understand the purpose," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what Brown had in mind was the grist of speculation and rumor 
throughout the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rumors are wild. Rumors are rampant," said Geoff Long, a veteran Ways and 
Means Committee consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Republicans win a majority, it is not clear how long they could 
control the lower house. One, and probably two, Republican Assembly members are 
expected to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) was elected to the state Senate in a 
special election last week, but also won reelection to his Assembly seat. He 
has vowed to keep his Assembly seat as long as it takes to cast a vote for 
Brulte as Speaker, and then move to the Senate, where Democrats still hold a 
21-17 majority, with two independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Mountjoy leaves for the Senate, the GOP majority would be 40 to 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Republican Assemblyman Ross Johnson of Fullerton and 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) also may be leaving. Johnson and Allen 
are both considering running for the state Senate seat being vacated on Jan. 2 
by Marian Bergeson, who was elected to the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 If either Johnson or Allen departs, the Assembly would be plunged into a 39-39 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Mark Gladstone and Eric Bailey in Sacramento and Ted 
Johnson in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

UPTURN HELPS STATE AVOID SPENDING CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to a modestly improved fiscal outlook, state officials are expected to 
announce today that automatic standby spending cuts will not be needed to keep 
the California government's cash balances in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 The state still faces a struggle to get its budget back in balance, and newly 
reelected Gov. Pete Wilson will outline his plan for doing that in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But the immediate cash shortage that lawmakers -- and the state's bankers -- 
feared would develop when they were writing the budget in July has not 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dodged a bullet this year," said state Controller Gray Davis. "But plans 
should be made immediately for the fiscal problems awaiting us a year from 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a family with too much credit card debt, the state has two related fiscal 
puzzles to solve. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the long-range problem of bringing expenses back into line with income. 
Although some progress has been made on that front in recent years, Wilson 
still faces a gap of more than $2 billion as he prepares a proposed budget to 
present to the Legislature on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem is in the state's cash flow -- or the ability to pay its 
bills each month. The state addressed that problem by borrowing nearly $7 
billion to keep its programs running through April, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's credit was so poor this year that a consortium of banks had to be 
enlisted, and paid handsomely, to co-sign on the borrowing. The private banks 
agreed to repay the state's creditors if the government could not. But to lower 
their risk, they demanded adoption of legislation that would make automatic 
budget corrections if the state's fiscal picture deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 That so-called trigger was set to be pulled today if the state's projected 
cash reserves had dropped more than $430 million four months into the fiscal 
year. In that case, the governor and the Legislature were to have until Feb. 15 
to correct the imbalance. If they deadlocked, the fix was automatic: 
across-the-board reductions in all programs not protected by the state 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than worsening, the state's books have improved. Davis said the 
projected cash balance in the state's general fund is $581 million greater than 
he had anticipated in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the good news is a result of the slowly improving economy. Tax 
receipts are up, while the number of poor people applying for welfare and 
subsidized health care is down. School enrollments also have dipped below 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve the long-term problem, Davis, who was elected lieutenant governor 
Nov. 8, will propose a detailed auditing of every state program and a "fiscal 
summit" at which legislators would meet with economists and experts from other 
states that have had similar budget difficulties.

MOLESTATION SUSPECT, AS OWN LAWYER, CONFRONTS ALLEGED VICTIMS; COURTS: TWO 
FORMER PATIENTS AT SIMI VALLEY HOSPITAL TESTIFY THAT NURSE'S AIDE FONDLED THEM. 
EXPERTS SAY VICTIMS MAY BE FURTHER TRAUMATIZED BY TRIAL EXPERIENCE.

<P>
 In a highly unusual sexual molestation trial in Simi Valley, the defendant has 
been allowed to function as his own lawyer, putting him in position to revisit 
his alleged crimes with his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Several family law experts, as well as social workers who counsel victims of 
sexual assault, deplored the courtroom confrontation because of its potential 
effect on the victims, but conceded that there were few options because of a 
defendant's right to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very disturbing," said Patricia Phillips, a Los Angeles 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of three victims in the case testified Monday that nurse's aide Victor 
Sumner fondled them while they were patients at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, a developmentally disabled 32-year-old, sternly reproached Sumner 
during his cross-examination when he asked why she had not leaned over and 
pushed him away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here about you," she said. "You're a mean man to ever do that to a girl 
who is in the hospital. Since you've done that I've been scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Sumner why she was scared, the woman, described in court as an 
epileptic having the mental capacity of an 8- to 10-year-old, responded: 
"Because you said you were going to take down your pants and make me have a 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The second woman, a 72-year-old who was so frail that she had to be wheeled 
into court on a hospital bed, also stood her ground during the examination from 
Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner quizzed her on her ability to remember the incident, and the woman 
responded by recounting the event in great detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to put this out of my mind," the woman said. "But I cannot forget 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Sumner cross-examining witnesses. As defense counsel, he also has 
access to their phone numbers and addresses. One victim said Monday that she 
was frightened because when the alleged crime occurred, he threatened to track 
her down and molest her again. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts who specialize in counseling sexual assault victims said Monday that 
facing the alleged assailant a second time may have been very traumatic for the 
women, even if they showed little emotion on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard enough to go through the trauma of an assault. I can't imagine how 
horrible it must be for them to face the perpetrator a second time," said Pam 
Cady, a counselor with the Ventura County Coalition Against Family and Sexual 
Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these risks, legal experts said Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Charles W. Campbell Jr. had little choice but to let Sumner represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any way around it," said Los Angeles attorney Gloria 
Allred. "He has the right to represent himself. But still, I think it raises 
serious questions because of the intimidation the victims may feel about coming 
forward to testify." 
</P>
<P>
 During arguments last week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig tried to 
persuade Judge Campbell to at least prevent Sumner from gaining access to 
victims' phone numbers and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell said Sumner, as the person in charge of the case, had the right 
to all pertinent information. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Peter Arenella said granting Sumner such access to his 
alleged victims is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally when people represent themselves in crimes of violence, it's not 
typical that (they) would be given access to the addresses and phone numbers of 
victims," Arenella said.

JUDGE ORDERS RESUMPTION OF BALLOT COUNT; ELECTION: FEINSTEIN STRETCHES HER 
MARGIN OVER HUFFINGTON AS ABSENTEE VOTES ARE TALLIED. HARMAN OVERTAKES BROOKS 
IN CONGRESSIONAL RACE AND KUYKENDALL PULLS AHEAD OF KARNETTE IN CRUCIAL 
ASSEMBLY CONTEST, BUT BOTH REMAIN TOO CLOSE TO CALL.

<P>
 Rejecting Republican charges of widespread voter fraud, a Superior Court judge 
Monday ordered absentee ballot counting resumed in Los Angeles County, as U.S. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein widened her lead over challenger Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 That action also came as a Republican pulled ahead in a crucial legislative 
race that would give the GOP control of the state Assembly for the first time 
in 25 years. And a Democratic congresswoman took her first lead in an effort to 
retain her seat representing the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert O'Brien ordered the tally of absentee ballots resumed two days 
after Republican Party activist Allen Brandstater persuaded another judge to 
temporarily halt the count, claiming that illegal immigrants, children and even 
a dog had been registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer who led the effort to halt the vote tally argued that current 
ballot counting techniques do not allow authorities to determine how fraudulent 
absentee voting affects the outcome of elections. Stephen Fleishman told 
O'Brien that information might later be needed to help the U.S. Senate 
determine the winner of the Senate contest, should the dispute reach that 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien headed off the possibility -- at least temporarily -- that the 
Senate, where the GOP will take control Jan. 1, would have any say in the close 
race between Democrat Feinstein and Republican Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien ruled in a terse order that Brandstater "failed to provide sufficient 
evidence to warrant deviating from the established statutory election process." 
But some Republicans said they might continue to press their legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's camp charged that the attack on the vote-counting procedures was 
orchestrated by Huffington out of "desperation" -- a charge denied by 
Huffington aides, despite ties between those mounting the legal challenge and 
the Huffington campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With tabulation of nearly 100,000 Los Angeles County absentee votes added to 
the statewide vote totals Monday, Feinstein had stretched her margin to 132,540 
-- nearly 9,000 votes more than on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ballots also helped reverse, for now, the election night result in the 
race for the state Assembly seat currently held by Betty Karnette (D-Long 
Beach). Her 64-vote lead was turned into a 476-vote advantage for challenger 
Steve Kuykendall, a Rancho Palos Verdes Republican, in a race that could help 
give the GOP control of the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly tabulated votes also helped push Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) 
to a narrow 260-vote lead over Republican Susan Brooks, reversing the 93-vote 
lead that Brooks had after election night. Harman's advantage came as something 
of a surprise, since she trailed the Republican challenger in absentee ballots 
that were counted on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the election results, however, were final. More than 500,000 votes 
statewide, including 120,000 from Los Angeles County, remain to be tallied. 
Election officials said they hope to have another update later this week and to 
complete all tabulation by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's lead seemed to be safe, given the trend of absentee ballots in her 
favor. Huffington would need about 62% of the remaining ballots to make up the 
difference. The two other races remained too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of all three races shifted Monday morning from the registrars' 
counting rooms around the state to O'Brien's courtroom in Downtown Los Angeles, 
where representatives of several candidates gathered to monitor the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman sought to distance the candidate from 
the court action, saying that the campaign had not directed the effort. "We are 
not the plaintiff in the case and we merely have counsel now to represent our 
interests," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater's lawyer, however, said that individuals affiliated with the 
Huffington campaign had been among those who approached him seeking to 
challenge the ballots. Another of Brandstater's attorneys works in the law firm 
advising the Huffington campaign. And Huffington's father, Roy, was present on 
Saturday, when a judge issued an order temporarily blocking the vote count. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffington campaign declined to discuss the presence of the candidate's 
father at Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart's home, where the order was 
issued. None of the other parties involved could offer an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Feinstein is pleased the judge saw through the charade of this lawsuit 
and turned it away," said Feinstein spokesman Bill Chandler. "Each passing day 
makes Sen. Feinstein more confident the results of Election Day will be 
upheld." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater is a longtime Republican activist and self-described "arch 
conservative" who is host of a radio talk show. His court papers requesting a 
halt to the vote count claimed that Democrats had been involved in widespread 
voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater had earlier complained that voter rolls had been padded with 
illegal immigrants, children and others -- complaints that were forwarded to 
the district attorney's office and became part of an ongoing criminal 
investigation. The activist had said that the standard counting technique would 
separate ballots from the voter-signed envelopes in which they were received, 
therefore destroying crucial evidence that could be used to contest the 
election later. 
</P>
<P>
 With the courts closed over the weekend, Brandstater's attorney sought out a 
Superior Court judge at home to obtain the order that temporarily halted 
tabulations. Swart was a Republican Party activist before he took the bench in 
1982 and has described himself in interviews as a close friend of Republican 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. Swart declined Monday to discuss the case or 
the presence of Huffington's father. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Brandstater's attorney renewed the argument that it was important 
to preserve the ballots and envelopes as evidence of potential voter fraud. He 
said the materials might later be used to "bring evidence before the U.S. 
Senate" on the validity of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said that he had been presented with no evidence to prove that 
improperly registered voters had voted illegally. Under sharp questioning by 
the judge, Fleishman, the Republican attorney, conceded that he had submitted 
only one declaration that indicated an absentee vote may have been cast 
improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman in the secretary of state's office said that the court action 
was worrisome because it might have postponed final certification of the 
election beyond the Dec. 17 legal deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of question could potentially have thrown the Feinstein-Huffington 
contest into the U.S. Senate, an unusual but not unprecedented event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has no set procedure for such decisions, in which it must decide 
whether to seat a new member, refuse to seat the member or seat the member 
"without prejudice," pending an investigation. In the last case, the Senate can 
subsequently remove a member by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kansas), the future Senate majority leader, 
said a challenge of the election by the GOP is unlikely unless there is a 
clearly disputed result. "The Senate is the final judge on the election of 
senators, but you don't challenge just because you lost a close race," said Bob 
Dove, a parliamentary consultant in Dole's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The court action Monday put Brandstater in the awkward position of blocking a 
count that appeared to be going in favor of another Republican, Kuykendall. 
Kuykendall's attorney argued against the injunction. And Colleen McAndrews, an 
attorney observing the hearing for the Republican congressional and state 
Assembly campaign committees, said those groups wanted Brandstater's motion 
defeated so they could claim their expected victories. "Based on what I heard, 
it sounds like they need to come forward with stronger evidence," she said of 
the legal challenge.

SALVADORAN IMMIGRANTS' FEARS GROW; REFUGEES: PROGRAM THAT LET TENS OF THOUSANDS 
LEGALLY STAY IN U.S. EXPIRES DEC. 31. WHITE HOUSE IS PONDERING AN EXTENSION, 
BUT ANY DECISION IS LIKELY TO SPARK PROTESTS.

<P>
 Already unsettled by Proposition 187, Southern California's huge Salvadoran 
exile community is bracing for another possible blow: next month's scheduled 
expiration of a program that has allowed tens of thousands of Salvadoran 
immigrants to remain in the United States legally for years. 
</P>
<P>
 While most experts agree that large-scale deportations are unlikely, rumors of 
such extreme action have sent a shudder through Salvadoran expatriate 
neighborhoods from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., and mobilized activists 
pressuring the White House for an extension of many Salvadorans' legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Salvadoran government's top-ranking official in the United 
States spoke in Los Angeles in an effort to quell the fears of compatriots 
worried both about the effects of Proposition 187 and the scheduled end of 
their legal immigration status Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be calm," Ana Cristina Sol, El Salvador's ambassador to the United States, 
urged her fellow citizens during a news conference at the Salvadoran consulate 
across from MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, heart of the Salvadoran community in 
the United States. "Continue sending your children to school, keep going to 
clinics if you need (medical) assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol (a distant relative of the 
ambassador) has condemned Proposition 187, which bars illegal immigrants from 
most public services, as has Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadorans, their numbers bolstered during a massive 1980s exodus as their 
nation was riven by civil war, may have surpassed Cubans as the second most 
populous Latino immigrant group, after Mexican nationals. As many as 400,000 
Salvadorans reside in the Los Angeles area, according to community estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Congress initially granted all Salvadoran citizens residing in the 
United States a special temporary "protected" status, barring most 
deportations, at a time when the civil war was still raging. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, a series of government actions have essentially extended that 
provision, shielding tens of thousands of Salvadoran immigrants from 
deportation. The protections outlasted the civil war, which ended in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, an estimated 90,000 Salvadoran nationals across the United States 
are protected under "Deferred Enforced Departure," initially granted by 
President Bush and later extended by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that status is due to expire Dec. 31, causing great consternation 
among Salvadorans. Many have been here 10 years or more and have no intention 
of returning to a land still suffering the aftereffects of a debilitating, more 
than decade-long civil war that left a legacy of economic ruin, political 
instability and widespread crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our life is here now," said Francisco Argueta, a Salvadoran immigrant who, 
along with his wife and 8-year-old son, are in the United States under deferred 
enforcement, having arrived seven years ago. "We have roots in this community, 
and we're not going to return." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is pondering whether to extend the program, a 
decision that will have considerable implications both for U.S. domestic and 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The matter is under review by the Department of Justice, in consultation with 
the White House and the State Department," said Ana Cobian, a Justice 
Department spokeswoman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Extending Salvadorans' special status would likely trigger a torrent of 
criticism, particularly in the current political atmosphere hostile to illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come for the El Salvadorans to go home," declared Dan Stein, 
executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a 
Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks restrictions on new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But denying the Salvadorans an extension would spark outrage among human 
rights advocates who have long championed the cause of Salvadoran refugees, the 
original beneficiaries of the sanctuary movement of the 1980s. Moreover, the 
Salvadoran government -- a staunch U.S. ally in Central America -- has formally 
requested that Salvadorans' protected status be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Remittances by Salvadorans to their homeland, believed to approach $1 billion 
annually, have helped to prop up a tottering economy. Any large-scale forced 
repatriation would likely have serious social and economic consequences in the 
struggling Central American nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say massive deportations are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 If their status is not extended, some Salvadorans are likely to return 
voluntarily. That would continue a trend that has accelerated since the civil 
war ended and large-scale illegal immigration of Salvadorans to the United 
States slowed to today's more moderate levels. Others denied extensions will 
revert to illegal status, securing false papers to assist them find and 
maintain jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the protected status ends, most Salvadoran immigrants will likely apply 
for political asylum, citing potential persecution if forced back to El 
Salvador and joining a U.S. asylum application backlog now approaching 500,000 
cases. Most asylum applicants would be eligible for working papers while their 
cases make their way through the system, a process that can drag on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Salvadorans may also seek relief under so-called "suspension of 
deportation" procedures, available for some illegal immigrants who have resided 
in the United States at least seven years. Applicants for suspension may win 
lawful permanent residence status if they can demonstrate good moral character 
and show that they would face severe hardship if forced to return. More on

IRAQ MAKES OFFICIAL ITS RENUNCIATION OF KUWAIT CLAIMS; PERSIAN GULF: DEPUTY 
PREMIER GIVES DOCUMENTS TO U.S. AMBASSADOR AT UNITED NATIONS. BUT SANCTIONS 
REMAIN IN FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a brief and cold professional exchange, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik 
Aziz on Monday handed American Ambassador Madeleine Albright a packet of legal 
documents giving up all of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's claims to the 
territory of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents -- an official recognition of Kuwait and its territorial 
integrity -- pleased the Security Council, but not enough for it to lift the 
sanctions on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 After members completed their bimonthly review of the sanctions, Albright, who 
is serving as president of the council this month, told reporters that the 
Security Council had decided to continue the sanctions "without change." 
</P>
<P>
 That was no surprise. The real battle over sanctions within the Security 
Council is not expected to take place for another six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting between Aziz and Albright, which lasted no more than two minutes, 
was the first between Cabinet-level officials of the two governments since 
former Secretary of State James A. Baker III conferred with Aziz before the 
start of the Persian Gulf War, a war fought because of Iraq's invasion and 
annexation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright, however, insisted that she was meeting Aziz only in her capacity as 
council president. In fact, her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said that she had 
betrayed her role as American ambassador only by wearing a brooch in the form 
of a snake. That was her way of thumbing her nose at Iraqi poet Ghazi Thai and 
at the government-run newspaper, Al Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Iraq recently published rhymed couplets by the poet in both English and 
Arabic that heaped scorn on Albright, blamed her for the sanctions and likened 
her to a snake. "Albright, Albright," the poem said, "why do you hate the day 
and love the night?" 
</P>
<P>
 American officials refused to let photographers into the brief Aziz-Albright 
meeting in the small office of the council president outside the main chamber 
of the Security Council. But an American official, describing the session for 
reporters, said that Aziz "did not seem his ebullient self" and that Albright 
"was very professional." 
</P>
<P>
 After the session with Aziz, Albright, aside from passing out the Iraqi 
documents, also handed each ambassador aerial photos of reconstructed 
government buildings and official residences in Iraq as evidence that Hussein, 
while accusing the United Nations of depriving his people of food with 
sanctions, is lavishing $1.2 billion on luxurious working space and living 
quarters for the ruling class. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have enough money to build these pleasure palaces," an American 
official told reporters, ". . . they ought to have enough money to provide 
additional services and goods to their people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you all feel like snickering," the official said to reporters, "but 
this is to rebut the charge . . . that the Security Council and the United 
States are responsible for the suffering of the Iraqi people." 
</P>
<P>
 This accusation, he said, is even believed by some people in the United 
States. He said that Albright recently received a broom from an American who 
called her a witch and blamed her for the suffering in Iraq. In a letter of 
reply, Albright, who has kept the broom in her office, told the writer that the 
real culprit is Hussein, a leader who does not care about his people. 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz dismissed the American outrage over the buildings as "rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every government has a palace for its head of state," he said, "and Iraq is a 
country of great builders. . . . The national palace is a symbol of the nation 
. . . and we are proud that all the sites that were bombed (in the Gulf War) 
have been rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 The distribution of the photos seemed to strike some ambassadors as somewhat 
histrionic. When asked about them, French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee 
laughed and said, "It is an interesting display of photographs, but it has 
nothing to do with the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 After turning over the documents, Aziz told reporters that it is time for "the 
council to honor its own resolutions" and lift the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no support in the Security Council for an immediate lifting of 
sanctions. The Russian and French ambassadors have suggested that the council 
members consider lifting the sanctions on the Iraqi sale of oil if the Hussein 
government cooperates fully, for six months, with a system of U.N. monitoring 
designed to make sure that it does not resume its programs of building weapons 
of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resolution covering this appears to provide for the lifting of 
sanctions whenever Iraq has eliminated such weapons and accepted a system of 
monitoring, the Clinton Administration insists that, no matter what the small 
print of the resolution states, no sanctions of any kind should be lifted until 
Iraq complies with all U.N. resolutions and thus satisfies the council members 
of its peaceful intentions.

NEWS ANALYSIS; IN PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, ARAFAT IS LOSING GROUND; MIDEAST: 
THE PLO LEADER FACES CRITICISM FROM ALL SIDES. THAT HAS ISRAEL WORRIED ABOUT 
HIS ABILITY TO KEEP CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In both the Gaza Strip, where he now resides, and the West Bank, where he 
hopes one day to rule, PLO leader Yasser Arafat's political fortunes are in a 
state of steep decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Even within Fatah, his own faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
Arafat faces increasingly harsh criticism for his handling of negotiations with 
Israel and his running of the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is being blamed for everything from Israel's repeated closure of the 
territories to a recent outbreak of cholera in the Gaza Strip. About 60 cases 
of the highly infectious disease were reported this month before doctors in 
Gaza finally declared Monday that it was under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do expect too much of Arafat," said Amin Makbool, a member of the 
Fatah Higher Committee for the West Bank, in an interview in Nablus. "The 
situation is hard, and people expect more than he can deliver. The nature of 
the revolution meant that we had to depend on the sole decision of the leader. 
Now, we need also the input of institutions, which we still lack. So everything 
has to go back to the leader, and he's only human. He makes mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching nervously from the sidelines is the Israeli government -- concerned 
that the man they are making peace with may not be able to maintain his grip on 
Palestinian society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinian Authority's ability to manage properly the Gaza Strip is very 
important to us," said Ephraim Sneh, Israel's minister of health and a former 
head of the civil administration in the West Bank. "We definitely want them to 
succeed, because their failure is the victory of Hamas." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, a militant Islamic group, is Arafat's strongest opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to illustrate that he still controls the PLO's most important 
institution, Arafat announced last week that, for the first time, the PLO's 
15-member Executive Committee will meet in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But within days, eight members declared that they will not attend the session, 
scheduled for today. The Executive Committee is the supreme governing body of 
the PLO, bringing together the various factions. It has been largely inactive 
since Arafat moved to Gaza in July and formed a governing authority there to 
run daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who say they will stay away from today's meeting are two veteran 
Fatah leaders -- Farouk Kaddoumi, Arafat's de facto minister of foreign 
affairs, and Mahmoud Abbas, a founding member of Fatah who oversaw the PLO's 
secret negotiations with Israel that led to the Oslo accords. They continue to 
run offices in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia -- Arafat's former headquarters -- 
and refuse to move to the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat's troubles are not confined to disgruntled officials living outside 
the territories. In the West Bank, Arafat was faced 10 days ago with the first 
elections to local Fatah councils, organized without his support. 
</P>
<P>
 During Israel's occupation, Fatah councils, always appointed by Arafat, 
provided clandestine, grass-roots support for the faction. The councils 
recruited members, disbursed funds and carried out activities in the 
territories. A year ago, after Israel and the PLO declared mutual recognition, 
Fatah activity in the West Bank and Gaza became legal. Local activists soon 
began to say that Arafat's method of appointing loyalists was outmoded, that 
Fatah needed to elect councils that could transform the guerrilla faction into 
a political party. 
</P>
<P>
 So Fatah activists in the West Bank organized elections. The first was held in 
Ramallah. It produced two elected councils. Reformers in Fatah hailed the 
development as the first step toward democratizing the faction and reshaping 
its mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, however, sent no congratulations to the new councils. And this week, 
Fatah announced the "postponement" of other elections scheduled across the West 
Bank. The reason given was technical difficulties. But sources within Fatah 
said that Arafat was displeased with the elections in Ramallah, where many 
former prisoners known to oppose him gained seats on the two councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he faces problems within Fatah, Arafat also is edging closer to 
confrontation with Islamic militants in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Arafat ordered his police force to arrest more leaders of the 
extremist Islamic Jihad group and to ban public demonstrations. The edict on 
demonstrations forced Jihad to scale down a march planned for Monday afternoon. 
Under the watchful eyes of hundreds of Palestinian police, militants mourned 
the death of Hisham Hamad, a 21-year-old suicide bomber who pedaled his 
explosives-laden bicycle into an Israeli checkpoint in Gaza on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials have had enough of Jihad's public muscle-flexing. On 
Friday, Jihad called thousands of supporters into the street to mourn the death 
of Hani Abed, a Jihad activist killed in a car bombing in southern Gaza on Nov. 
2. Their march began shortly before Hamad blew himself up along with three 
Israeli reserve army officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jihad said that Hamad's attack was revenge for Abed's death -- for which they 
blame the Israelis. Sprinkled throughout the mourners at Friday's demonstration 
were young men wearing white sheets -- symbolizing their willingness to become 
martyrs by carrying out suicide attacks -- and masked men who fired Kalashnikov 
rifles into the air and chanted slogans against Israel, the United States and 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat continues to make overtures to the militants, however. Last week, he 
appointed two Hamas supporters as members of the religious courts in Gaza and 
the West Bank, and he has met with political leaders of Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad. He is trying to walk an increasingly fine line, his supporters say, 
between drawing Islamic militants and their supporters into the political 
process and preventing their military wings from destroying his fragile 
negotiations with Israel.

ENVIRONMENT; EXPERTS LOOK TO WILDLIFE LAW CENTER AS VALUABLE RESOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wildlife management used to consist of little more than issuing hunting and 
fishing permits and keeping an eye peeled for poachers. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't that simple anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife officials these days labor amid a thicket of environmental issues, 
including endangered species protection, biodiversity and habitat management. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping up with changes in laws and regulations could be a full-time job in 
itself. Luckily, they have somewhere to turn for help: the University of New 
Mexico's Center for Wildlife Law. 
</P>
<P>
 With a growing catalogue of publications, the center is gaining notice as a 
valuable resource for game and fish managers, as well as environmentalists, 
lawmakers, journalists and anyone else interested in wildlife policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a state-by-state comparison of poaching laws? Check out the 
center's 840-page "State Wildlife Laws Handbook." Need a biodiversity policy 
survey? The center is on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The center publishes a newsletter, runs a wildlife education program for 
at-risk middle-schoolers and is overseeing an environmental impact statement on 
plans to reintroduce the endangered Mexican gray wolf to rural areas in New 
Mexico and Arizona. Also in the works is a handbook of federal wildlife laws 
funded by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has a full-time staff of five, along with assorted part-time and 
contract employees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the action is Ruth Musgrave, who founded the center in 1990 
after a career in such varied areas of the law as bankruptcy, oil-and-gas 
leases and medical malpractice defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Musgrave, 40, who grew up in Southern California and spent her summers during 
college tending bottlenose dolphins at Marineland, has had a long-term love 
affair with animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to go into studying wildlife somehow," she says. Along the 
way she has helped define a new but growing legal specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Musgrave approached Paul Nathanson, director of the university's Institute of 
Public Law, who gave his blessings for a wildlife law institute -- provided 
Musgrave could attract the needed funding. 
</P>
<P>
 She began with a desk and a telephone and eventually drew the backing of the 
Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, which helped underwrite the "State Wildlife Laws 
Handbook." The center now has its own offices in an inconspicuous brick 
building near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing couldn't have been better. State wildlife managers in recent years 
have begun to shift from the traditional task of overseeing game species, like 
deer and waterfowl, to managing entire ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Musgrave notes, habitat protection and other biodiversity measures 
usually run smack into private property rights, creating a recipe for 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the West, landowners are challenging state and federal 
environmental measures as an unlawful "taking" of property by the government, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wildlife issues have been ignored for so long," Musgrave says. "Now these 
statutes are coming into force because human development is really pushing up 
against wildlife habitat. Wildlife law is going to get more attention because 
the developers aren't going to be able to ignore it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 David Favre, interim dean at the Detroit College of Law and a pioneering 
wildlife law theorist, says Musgrave's center "represents a sort of 
coming-out-of-the-closet of wildlife issues." As the uproar over protection of 
the spotted owl demonstrates, the implementation of wildlife policy raises 
difficult questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wildlife isn't just something about what your dad did when he went out 
hunting," Favre says. "It's a major focus in the United States, both 
ecologically and economically." 
</P>
<P>
 Favre says the center's handbooks and newsletter are helping create a 
framework for studying the legal aspects of wildlife management. 
</P>
<P>
 Musgrave says an obstacle to the goals of biodiversity and ecosystem 
management is the patchwork of regulations in various states. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, poaching in some jurisdictions is punished with little more than 
a slap on the wrist, while it can draw jail time and hefty fines in others.

POLITICS; NORTH TOOK HIS LUMPS BUT HE'LL BE BACK, EXPERTS SAY; LOSER IN SENATE 
RACE, HE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN A MAJOR PRESENCE ON THE GOP STAGE. ONE ANALYST 
BELIEVES HE MUST REDEFINE HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back when he was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, Oliver L. North was 
in a car crash that nearly ended his career, not to mention his life. Officials 
thought his injuries too severe for him to continue at the academy, but he 
begged to be let back in -- and went on to become a collegiate boxing champ. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Ollie North ran into the political equivalent of that car crash, 
losing the Virginia Senate race to a Democratic incumbent so weakened by 
scandal and anti-incumbency sentiment that almost any Republican was favored to 
beat him. Immediately packing his family off on a vacation to recuperate, North 
left friends and foes alike wondering if he can ever recover from his head-on 
collision with Virginia voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But many analysts, Democrats and Republicans, say it is too soon to write off 
North as a political force or a candidate for statewide or even national 
office. They predict that he will remain a commanding presence on the extreme 
right of the GOP stage for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just so much energy in both the name and what he represents that I'm 
certain he will continue to be a real presence in Virginia politics, and his 
demonstrated ability to raise money for conservative causes will assure that," 
says Patrick McSweeny, the state Republican Party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Already there is talk of him challenging Republican Sen. John W. Warner in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 North's campaign aides say the former Iran-Contra figure intends to remain 
active in politics but has not yet decided what he will do. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ed DeBolt, a GOP political consultant who advises a number of Virginia 
Republicans, notes that, despite his loss to Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb, 
North remains in a strong position to mount a comeback if he "manages his 
resources wisely" and uses the next two years to "redefine himself by raising 
his positives and lowering the negatives." 
</P>
<P>
 North's negatives, of course, include his 1989 felony convictions for 
shredding documents, accepting illegal gratuities and misleading Congress about 
the Iran-Contra affair -- the complicated secret arrangement that sent arms to 
Iran for release of hostages and generated cash for rebels in Nicaragua. North 
managed the operation from the basement of the White House as a senior aide for 
the National Security Council during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the convictions were subsequently overturned on a technicality, 
North's dark background and former First Lady Nancy Reagan's characterization 
of him as a congenital liar cast a shadow over his campaign that none of his 
professional image-makers were ultimately able to dispel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College in 
Fredricksburg, Va., said North "had a lot going for him in the campaign -- the 
anti-incumbent mood, the anti-Clinton mood and the fact that he was running 
against a candidate tainted by personal scandal, and yet he still couldn't win 
because the voters saw him as someone they couldn't trust. In the end, people 
were still afraid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Rozell and other analysts agree with GOP strategists who believe that the 
charisma North exhibited in the campaign established him as a permanent and 
possibly ascendant figure on the political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, a lot of people thought the climate was right for someone like 
Ross Perot, but he ultimately discredited himself," one campaign aide said. 
"This year things looked right for Ollie. We were wrong about that. But 
although he took his lumps, North in some ways ended this campaign stronger 
than when he started. He did not discredit himself among his supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, North's core following of blue-collar conservatives and evangelical 
Christians seems, if anything, more committed to him, blaming his defeat on a 
conspiracy by liberal Democrats and the media. A spellbinding speaker, North 
retains their allegiance and his access to them through a 250,000-member 
national mailing list that he used to help raise $18 million, more money than 
any other Senate candidate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his mailing list and his ability to inspire intense loyalty among a 
significant segment of the Republican population, Oliver North is not going to 
go away," said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. "He 
will have a prominent role, but the only question is whether it will be as a 
candidate again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Republican Party, in spite of its anger at Warner for splitting 
the party by backing rival Republican J. Marshall Coleman, is likely to have 
second thoughts about nominating North to run again in 1996 in view of his loss 
to Robb, who, going into the campaign, was considered one of the most 
vulnerable Democrats running for reelection this year. But even if North does 
not run, his support for a rival candidate could help ensure that Warner loses. 
</P>
<P>
 And DeBolt even sees a parallel between North and Richard Nixon, who staged a 
national comeback in 1968 after his politically disastrous defeat to John F. 
Kennedy eight years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason why North can't redefine himself as Nixon did if he looks 
at his experience carefully," DeBolt said. "All his negatives are already out 
there, and he's got two years to repair the damage. If he uses his newfound 
friendships, his mailing lists and his fund-raising expertise for Republican 
Party causes, North is likely to be a more credible candidate in the years to 
come."

 With Washington in turmoil and his party racked with post-election anguish, 
President Clinton's trip to distant Indonesia this week might seem a 
masterpiece of ill timing. 
</P>
<P>
 It might, except that its chief subject, trade, has gradually emerged as one 
of the strongest elements in his foreign policy -- and one that figures to be 
even more vital to him politically in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 As health care reform has come unstrung and some other parts of his domestic 
agenda have bogged down, Clinton and his economic team have ground out a string 
of large and small wins on trade and laid the groundwork for others. Last 
week's Democratic electoral rout promises to give trade even more prominence 
for the embattled President as one enterprise he can pursue partly without 
congressional assent. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the Administration has successfully pushed passage of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, increased government promotion of U.S. exports, 
advanced some regional economic initiatives and generally raised the diplomatic 
prominence of trade issues. If December brings the congressional adoption of 
the massive General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Clinton will have grounds 
for some serious boasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some experts say trade is the one area of clarity and resolve in a 
foreign policy that has often been fogbound. 
</P>
<P>
 In this eight-day trip, Clinton hopes to push the transpacific trade group 
called the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to a general timetable for 
free trade. And next month he will head to Miami to talk to Latin American 
leaders about trade liberalization at the Summit of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been championing the notion of the big payoff from greater trade 
since his campaign days: It was, in fact, the fifth paragraph of his campaign 
announcement speech in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is routinely referred to in speeches as a wellspring of hope in an 
American future that otherwise looks all too bleak. His trade strategy, he said 
last week at Georgetown University, is a "strategy to help every American 
family, every American worker . . . from the worldwide growth and prosperity it 
will bring." 
</P>
<P>
 All this is fraught with irony. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Clinton built his challenge to President George Bush's foreign policy 
around assertions that Bush was not wary enough on NAFTA, was too cozy with the 
Chinese and was a pushover in the face of the Japanese trade juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Now when trade issues clash with other concerns, the others give way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration decontrolled high-technology exports in 1993 -- in a big 
boost for California -- though the Pentagon feared the move could put 
sophisticated weapons in dangerous hands. It renewed most-favored-nation 
trading status for China last May, despite the objections of human-rights 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's meeting between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin, trade 
and North Korea topped the agenda, while human rights was again present but 
secondary. "They stuck to the strategic elements of our relationship," as one 
senior Administration official put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton arrived in Jakarta on Sunday as some East Timor dissidents were 
demonstrating, and others rioting, to publicize their complaints of Indonesian 
government oppression. But while Clinton has carefully assured the world that 
in Wednesday's meeting with Indonesian President Suharto he will discuss human 
rights, it was also clear that he does not want these concerns to derail the 
economic summit or relations with the world's fourth-largest nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another irony lies in the fact that the most immediate beneficiary of all 
these efforts -- American business -- has remained stubbornly resistant to 
Clinton's efforts to win its approval. "This Administration has bent over 
backwards for business on trade: NAFTA, big tax breaks, export promotion, you 
name it," said one aide. But the response from business is only bitter 
rejection, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe that if the Republicans continue their gradual drift 
toward protectionism, Clinton could actually begin capturing some of their 
supporters because of his trade-opening efforts. But that has yet to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he hasn't won business over, his free-trade tilt has caused plenty 
of problems with his core constituency of labor, as well as countless 
non-unionized workers who see open borders as a threat to their jobs, their 
future and their children's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton recognizes how hard it is to sell the blessings of freer trade to 
nervous American workers. "For too many of our people, trade appears to be a 
gale-force wind, just another threat ready to blow away the prospects of a 
stable job at a good wage," the President said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he's crowing about how the North American trade pact boosted 
exports to Mexico 20% in the first six months after it was passed, creating as 
many as 100,000 jobs. And he's insisting that trade efforts must be coupled 
with efforts to help American workers compete in the new economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as Administration officials and free-trade advocates say the need for 
liberalization is becoming more important, polls show public support is 
declining. And the opposition of workers could become truly brutal if the 
economy went into a tailspin and the outside world suddenly seemed even more 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Bush worked hard for NAFTA, Clinton has clearly pushed harder on trade 
generally. Bush had the patrician Republican's belief in the benefits of open 
trade, but he wasn't as eager to use government to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, it may be easier for Clinton to push formation of new trade 
groups. His advocacy will not bring the same fierce opposition from human 
rights and environmental groups that a Republican's effort would have 
engendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some analysts argue that Bush could never have rounded up the more 
than 100 Democratic votes Clinton lined up -- painfully -- for the NAFTA vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton clearly believes in the issue. And it fills his need for the kind of 
hope-inspiring message that can be so useful to presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became President, I did not want to see this world polarized by 
trading blocs that would take the place of the nuclear blocs of the Cold War," 
Clinton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's efforts with the 17 Asia-Pacific countries, which range from China 
and Brunei to South Korea and Chile, show the value -- and the political limits 
-- of his trade efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides lay out a compelling rationale for this Asia economic 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 As he said Monday, the region already accounts for about a third of the 
exports to the United States, and about 2 million American jobs. "The American 
people cannot be as prosperous as they need to be unless we succeed here in 
Asia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk of APEC produced another benefit: It helped scare some European 
nations into accepting GATT as a means of diminishing the threat of an 
exclusive Asian trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that with NAFTA in the bag and GATT's completion almost in 
view, the next big advances in free trade are some distance off. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite confident predictions of some Administration officials that this 
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group will deliver another 
"quantum leap" advance, the immediate future is likely to hold only incremental 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some analysts predict that Clinton's political weakness and the 
growing momentum of protectionist sentiment could force him to slow his 
efforts. Last week, Clinton suddenly began again using his campaign-year 
rhetoric of "fair trade" instead of "free trade," suggesting that the United 
States needs to push the kind of tough line that may not yield further 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 And, too, there is the sobering possibility that GATT may be torpedoed in its 
final hours, perhaps over concern about the threat to national sovereignty 
posed by its successor organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who will become the new Speaker of the House, has 
declared this week that he will work for it, and that will help. Some 
Administration officials think Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), soon to be Senate 
majority leader, will join in if he can strike a deal to get support for a 
capital gains tax cut in return. 
</P>
<P>
 But victory is not in the bag. And a loss on GATT would be devastating to the 
President, and at least slow his market-opening efforts.

TRADE TALKS IN THE PACIFIC; RIGHTS ISSUES TAKE STAGE AT SUMMIT; ASIA: PROTESTS 
OVER EAST TIMOR EMBARRASS INDONESIA, WHICH HAD HOPED TO POLISH IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Human rights intruded into the summit of Asian leaders Monday with scores of 
demonstrators arrested in the disputed territory of East Timor and President 
Clinton interceding for students holding a protest in the U.S. Embassy compound 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 people were reported to have rioted Monday at the university in East 
Timor, throwing stones at police after a scuffle between a student and a street 
vendor. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence marked the third day of unrest in East Timor, 1,200 miles east of 
Jakarta. A former Portuguese colony, the territory was annexed by Indonesia in 
1975 and has been the scene of frequent ethnic violence between Roman Catholic 
Timorese and predominantly Muslim Indonesian settlers and soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 News agency reports from Dili, the capital of Timor, quoted authorities as 
saying that more than 80 people were arrested in the rioting, in which stores 
were burned and car windows were smashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been burning and throwing stones," Police Chief Sukianto Andreas 
said of the students. "These are criminal activities. We have arrested them 
because of these activities and we will charge them in court." 
</P>
<P>
 The city was nearly deserted Monday, with most schools and shops closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrations over the weekend were timed to coincide with the third 
anniversary of a shooting incident at a Dili cemetery where Indonesian troops 
killed an estimated 200 people during a funeral procession. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's violence deeply embarrassed the Indonesian government, which 
was hoping that the summit meeting of the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum would help embellish its image. Instead, thousands of 
journalists attending the conference have given the human rights problem more 
coverage than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told reporters the United States had been assured that Indonesian 
authorities would not seek retribution against 29 students who scaled a fence 
at the U.S. Embassy on Saturday and have been holding a sit-in since then. 
</P>
<P>
 The students have told reporters that they want to meet with Clinton or 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to press their demands for the release of 
Timorese guerrilla leader Jose (Xanana) Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year prison 
sentence for his separatist activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the United States "had no problem with these young people coming 
and expressing their views in our embassy grounds, and we've talked with them 
and worked with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The embassy has been providing the students with food, water and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton sought reassurance from the Indonesians after the students complained 
that Indonesian military intelligence has threatened their safety. A number of 
the students, looking tired and bedraggled, indicated they will call off the 
demonstration if they receive assurances that they will not be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a small problem," Indonesian State Secretary Murdiono, a close 
aide to President Suharto, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Portuguese press agency reported that the students at the U.S. Embassy 
want political asylum in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to go to Portugal because according to international law we are 
Portuguese," student leader Domingos Sarmento Alves told the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Timorese who were arrested during demonstrations last year were 
eventually allowed to leave for Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also raised human rights issues Monday in a meeting with Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin, but there apparently was no agreement. A Chinese 
spokesman said Jiang stressed the differences in the two systems. "China needs 
stability, without which its recent gains will be lost," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Clinton announced that the United States would no longer 
link most-favored-nation trade status for the Chinese with rights record, after 
it became clear that the Chinese were prepared to suffer a trade war rather 
than appear to capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although human rights are not on the agenda at the APEC summit talks, Clinton 
has promised to raise the issue in bilateral meetings with Asian leaders.

TIME TO REPENT HISTORY'S SINS, POPE SAYS; RELIGION: CATHOLICS URGED TO PURIFY 
THEMSELVES BEFORE CROSSING 'THRESHOLD OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Looking ahead to the year 2000, Pope John Paul II demanded Monday that his 
church publicly repent for sins committed by Catholics across history in 
errant, overzealous defense of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic Church, according to the Pope, "cannot cross the threshold 
of the new millennium without encouraging her children to purify themselves, 
through repentance, of past errors and instances of infidelity, inconsistency 
and slowness to act." 
</P>
<P>
 The major papal policy statement came in a 16,000-word letter to Catholics 
that emerged from deliberations in June by cardinals considering how their 
church should enter its third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 In context, Monday's letter represents a papal riposte to prophets of doom in 
Rome and at the Vatican who believe that John Paul's papacy is waning in 
infirmity. 
</P>
<P>
 The 74-year-old pontiff, who is recovering slowly from a broken leg, makes 
clear in the letter that his world travels remain a major priority. As if for 
emphasis, John Paul made a point of telling a delegation of Bulgarians who 
visited him Monday that he hopes to visit their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my fervent wish to visit Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Middle 
East: Lebanon, Jerusalem and the Holy Land," the Pope writes the 950 million 
members of his church. In the year 2000, John Paul says, he would like to visit 
biblical lands "through Egypt and Mt. Sinai, as far as Damascus." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, John Paul outlines plans for a series of reflections, meetings 
and ceremonies building up to 2000, which his church will celebrate as a "great 
jubilee which will take place simultaneously in the Holy Land, in Rome and in 
local churches around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Examining errors of the past is important for the church's next millennium, 
John Paul tells Catholics in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church should become more fully conscious of the sinfulness of her 
children; recalling all those times in history when they departed from the 
spirit of Christ and his Gospel and . . . indulged in ways of thinking and 
acting which were truly forms of counter-witness and scandal," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope does not dwell on particular cases, but they will be forthcoming as 
grist of the self-examination he seeks: A Catholic's confession must be 
specific for a priest to grant absolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another painful chapter of history to which the sons and daughters of the 
church must return with a spirit of repentance is that of the acquiescence 
given, certainly in certain centuries, to intolerance, and even to the use of 
violence in the service of the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope's invitation is to re-examine the church's role as a pillar of 
Western civilization in which it ruled for many centuries as both a spiritual 
and temporal power. 
</P>
<P>
 In this millennium, the Crusades, dissolute Popes whose lust for power fueled 
Protestant revolt, and the courts of the Spanish Inquisition are all dark pages 
in church history. So, too, was the forced evangelization of the New World, 
intolerance of other religions and the church's failure to speak strongly 
against slavery in the Americas or this century's Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Pope writes, cultural conditioning may have allowed Catholics 
to believe that "an authentic witness to the truth could include suppressing 
the opinions of others, or at least paying no attention to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he says, "mitigating factors do not exonerate the church from the 
obligation to express profound regret for the weaknesses of so many of her sons 
and daughters who sullied her face." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sins that require "a greater commitment to repentance and 
conversion" in the papal view are those that divided Christians. As this 
millennium ends, John Paul laments, wounds between religions are even deeper 
than they were in the first 1,000 years after the death of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Inter-religious dialogue should have a preeminent role in celebrations of the 
millennium, the Pope says, calling for special emphasis on talks by Christians 
with Jews and Muslims.

CHINA ACCUSES TAIWANESE OF SHELLING VILLAGE, INJURING 4; ASIA: INCIDENT IS 
FIRST REPORT OF HOSTILITIES ACROSS THE NARROW STRAIT SEPARATING THE LANDS IN 
MORE THAN 15 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Taiwanese military officials said today they are investigating the possibility 
that Taiwanese soldiers on the Taiwan-held island of Lesser Quemoy 
"accidentally or mistakenly" shelled a mainland Chinese village, wounding four 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was reported Monday by the official New China News Agency in 
Beijing. It was the first report of hostilities across the narrow strait 
separating Taiwan-held territory and the Chinese mainland in more than 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government today reacted strongly to the incident, calling it "a 
vicious incident that sabotaged the peaceful atmosphere across the Taiwan 
strait." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the New China News Agency report, Taiwanese troops posted on 
Lesser Quemoy, or Xiao Jinmen, "fired at least a dozen shells" Monday morning 
at a suburb of Xiamen, a port in Fujian province. The news agency reported four 
people were wounded, two seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, a spokesman for the Taiwan Defense Ministry said 
today that military officials "are checking out the facts to see who is 
responsible." Without confirming or denying that the incident occurred, the 
spokesman said, "It is reasonable to think that it was probably a mistake or an 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The report of the shelling came at a sensitive time in Taiwan politics. On 
Dec. 3, voters in Taiwan's two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, will elect 
mayors from candidates that include representatives of the ruling Nationalist 
Party and the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls show the Democratic Progressive Party candidate, Chen Shui-bien, 
leading in Taipei, the capital and biggest city. However, any flare-up of 
military tensions with the mainland would be sure to benefit the Nationalists, 
who control the military and officially call for the overthrow of the 
mainland's Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwan-held island groups of Quemoy and Matsu, 150 miles to the northeast, 
have long been symbols of Nationalist intentions to some day reconquer the 
mainland they fled after their defeat by the Communists in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Quemoy became a centerpiece in the Cold War as Communist forces fired 
more than 475,000 shells at the island from the mainland, killing 587 
Nationalist troops and 800 civilians. In recent years, however, as economic 
relations between Taiwan and the mainland have developed, the tensions on the 
islands have greatly diminished.

CLINTON WEIGHS U.S. ENTRY FOR CUBAN CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and MIKE CLARY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is considering allowing thousands of Cuban children 
and their families who are now detained at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba, to enter the United States, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move would mark a reversal of President Clinton's policy against granting 
asylum to Cubans who fled their homeland on rafts and makeshift boats this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A trickle of Cubans have arrived in Miami in recent weeks as the 
Administration quietly permitted several dozen children and elderly and infirm 
refugees to enter this country under humanitarian exceptions to the existing 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposed policy, which could be adopted within days, would allow as 
many as a third of the 23,390 Cubans at Guantanamo into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The release would apply to about 3,000 Cuban children younger than 17 and 
their family members and caretakers at the camps. Most are expected to settle 
permanently in the Miami area, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno announced in August that the rafters would 
be detained indefinitely at Guantanamo and would have no hope of entering the 
United States legally. This reversal of a longstanding open-door policy for 
Cuban immigrants came in response to a mass exodus from the island after Cuban 
President Fidel Castro lifted restrictions on emigrating. Castro has since 
reimposed the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuban American groups have protested the no-entry policy and complained of 
the inhumane conditions in the camps, saying they are particularly hard on 
children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is also looking toward the first Summit of the Americas, a 
meeting of Latin American leaders planned for Dec. 9-11 in Miami. There are 
concerns that Cuban Americans will stage large protests during the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Vazquez, a Cuban American lawyer in Miami who has sued the 
Administration over the detention policy, said there is virtually no opposition 
among Cuban American groups to allowing the refugees into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that conditions are worsening in the camps, and many Cubans in 
this country are angry about the Administration's policy and plan to protest 
noisily at the 30-nation summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summit is fast approaching, and the government wants a quiet, successful 
summit and not a lot of people demonstrating," Vazquez said.

YELTSIN SEES 'CERTAIN TOUGHENING' BY U.S. UNDER GOP; RUSSIA: HE TELLS NATION'S 
TOP ARMY OFFICERS THAT HE MUST CULTIVATE SUPPORT AMONG REPUBLICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin warned his top military officers on Monday to steel 
themselves for "a certain toughening" in U.S. foreign and military policy 
toward Russia in the wake of Republican midterm election gains. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first public reaction to the new conservative wave in American 
politics, Yeltsin also told a conference of Russian army officers he had 
realized that "it's necessary to work out relations with the Republicans, to 
even out our relations with the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin enjoys a hearty friendship with President Clinton but has done little 
to cultivate support among the Republicans who will now dominate Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the hundreds of officers attending the annual military planning 
meeting that he wants to avoid a mistake like the one the old Kremlin made when 
it ignored the Republicans during the Jimmy Carter presidency and paid the 
price when Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the victory of the Republicans and lack of contacts with them led to an 
acceleration of the arms race and aggravation of relations between the 
superpowers," Yeltsin said, according to Russian reporters who were allowed to 
attend the conference. "This must not be permitted today." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian analysts, who perceive Republicans as decidedly tougher toward Moscow, 
predict that U.S.-Russian relations will inevitably begin to worsen now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not exclude the emergence of some problems in Russian-American 
relations," commented the respected Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper. "The 
Yeltsin-Clinton relationship may weaken significantly due to the pressure 
rendered on the presidents by both parliaments. Traditionally, the Republicans 
were cooler to Moscow than the Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper questioned whether Clinton would be able to keep his promise, 
made during his summit meeting with Yeltsin in Washington in September, to have 
Congress lift barriers to Russian exports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Georgy Arbatov, formerly the longtime head of the USA-Canada 
Institute, which is the main Russian think tank on America, said that "we 
should not feel fear, we should just feel some apprehension." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't exclude the possibility that our relations will worsen," he said. 
"The anti-American mood has become stronger in Russia compared to 1991. There 
is such a mood in our Parliament as well. Now, maybe the anti-Russian mood will 
be amplified in its American counterpart. Or maybe not. We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's comments on the U.S. elections came in the course of a climactic 
annual meeting meant to provide an overview of the performance of Russia's 
armed forces and their plans for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian president's concerns about relations with the United States 
followed his warning that although the threat of a superpower war has abated, 
Russia must still worry about the spread of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real possibility is arising that Third World countries will obtain nuclear 
missiles, and the probability that they will be used by these countries is 
growing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also praised the Russian army's recent peacekeeping roles in war-torn 
former Soviet republics and its relatively orderly retreat from the Baltics and 
Germany over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did get into the most painful of points for servicemen -- the 
diminishing budget allotments that lead to disasters such as September's brief 
blackout at a nuclear missile command post that had failed to pay its 
electricity bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin criticized top officers for reforming the army's structure too slowly 
and for doing little to maintain "positive public opinion" about the armed 
forces, but Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's position seemed to be safe for the 
moment, anyway. But the defense committee in the Duma, the lower house of 
Parliament, is slated on Thursday to consider whether to ask for Grachev's 
resignation.

TROPICAL STORM GORDON SLAMS ACROSS FLORIDA; WEATHER: DISASTER IS AVERTED, BUT 
HIGH WINDS EVOKE BAD MEMORIES OF 1992'S HURRICANE ANDREW. AT LEAST 100 DEATHS 
IN CARIBBEAN ARE REPORTED.

 Blustery winds and driving rain lashed much of Florida Monday as Tropical 
Storm Gordon canceled school for 9,200 children in the Keys, diverted the space 
shuttle to California and recalled for many the horror of Hurricane Andrew two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before bearing down on Florida, the late-season storm was blamed for at least 
100 deaths in the Caribbean, where heavy rains caused flooding and mudslides in 
Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
 With sustained winds of about 50 m.p.h., Gordon did not threaten Florida with 
widespread disaster. But howling gusts of up to 65 m.p.h. knocked out power to 
more than 200,000 homes and businesses, rocked vehicles stalled on flooded 
streets and pushed tides onto roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remember what happened two years ago, so weather is always a concern," 
said Principal Estela Santiago of Homestead's Redondo Elementary School, which 
was largely destroyed by Andrew in August, 1992. "So far the students are doing 
fine, but the parents keep calling." 
</P>
<P>
 As the diffuse center of Gordon headed west through the Florida Straits and 
across the heart of the Florida Keys late Monday, forecasters hoisted tropical 
storm warnings for most of South Florida, from Palm Beach to Ft. Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving rain pounded the area as bands of thunderstorms north of the storm's 
eye swirled over land. Near Largo, U.S. 1, which links the Peninsula to the 
Keys, was closed while state highway workers hauled in rocks to shore up the 
eroding highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was light. "People are staying home, out of the wind," said Florida 
Highway Patrol dispatcher Jan Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard and Navy combined to pulled nine crewmen 
and a dog from a 180-foot Haitian freighter foundering in 20-foot seas east of 
Key Largo. The sailors were airlifted from the Juno Express by two helicopters 
and ferried ashore, according to a Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm forced the shuttle Atlantis from its scheduled Kennedy Space Center 
landing to an alternate site at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, 
said Monday's high winds and heavy rainfall were likely the worst Gordon had to 
offer South Florida. But once into the Gulf of Mexico, he said, Gordon could 
stall and strengthen. By Wednesday or Thursday, Sheets said, a rejuvenated 
storm could threaten Florida again or make landfall elsewhere on the Gulf 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling tree branches knocked down power lines as the storm moved through. 
Strong surf eroded beaches from Palm Beach to Miami. High winds caused flight 
delays and some cancellations at Miami International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami Beach and the Keys, tourists hunkered down at bars or in their rooms 
after fishing and diving trips were called off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of people here for scuba diving who are just practicing in the 
pool," said Faye M. Bailey, assistant general manager of the Marina del Mar in 
Key Largo. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon was born Thursday from a tropical depression that formed off the east 
coast of Nicaragua. The storm moved north over Jamaica and eastern Cuba, 
spreading high winds and rain throughout the region. Dozens of deaths were 
reported in Haiti, while flooding was linked to the drowning of two Jamaicans. 
</P>
<P>
 At the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, blustery winds Sunday 
flattened several of the tents in which some 23,000 Cuban and 6,000 Haitian 
refugees are being housed, but a base spokesman said no injuries or deaths were 
reported. Wind gusts of 120 m.p.h. were reported in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon is the seventh tropical storm of the six-month hurricane season, which 
ends Nov. 30.

'NEW ORDER' COMETH, GOP'S INCOMING LEADERS PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The incoming Republican leadership of Congress took the first steps toward an 
uneasy revolution Monday, with the House team promising a "transformation . . . 
not only a transition" to a "new order" in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And while pledging to guarantee full participation by the Democratic minority, 
they vowed to keep the House in session seven days a week if that's what it 
takes to pass their "contract with America," a slate of legislative goals, in 
the first 100 days of the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and soon-to-be Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) met for the first time since last Tuesday's 
elections and sought to put a tranquil face on what is widely expected to be a 
complex and fragile relationship. Though there was nothing but smiles for 
reporters Monday, they are about to embark on a struggle to see who will be the 
most powerful member of Congress: Dole, the elder moderate, or Gingrich, the 
new Republican revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of a new order was most clearly sounded by the Republican captains 
designated by Gingrich to direct the dismantling of a Democratic system that 
has governed the House for 40 years. "This is time to be open to dramatic, bold 
changes," Gingrich told a crowded news conference at which he introduced the 
leaders of his transition team. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly one could hear it in the rhetoric of Rep. Jim Nussle (R-Iowa), the 
little-known 34-year-old sophomore congressman in charge of the transition: "I 
think it was Albert Einstein that said, 'The problems of today cannot be solved 
by the same thinking which created those problems in the first place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But even some of Gingrich's own troops sounded uneasy with the degree of 
promised change. Veteran Kansas Republican Rep. Pat Roberts, who will be the 
Senate liaison during the transition, cautioned reporters "that change for the 
sake of change may sound good, but you have to beware of the law of unintended 
effects." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican House leadership team came armed with an effort to evoke a 
stronger sense of bipartisanship than Gingrich's earlier comments might have 
suggested. Gingrich had made headlines by saying he would cooperate but not 
compromise when he controls the House. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid confrontation Monday, Gingrich refused to discuss what might happen 
when the GOP takes control of the House, saying, "I'll talk about the 
transition assignment and about the family committee. That's all." 
</P>
<P>
 The new family committee was part of the conciliatory effort. Called the 
Advisory Committee on Family Quality of Life, the group is charged with making 
the House schedule more closely mirror the school calendar so that lawmakers 
and their aides can spend more time with their families. Gingrich promised it 
will have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans and will include spouses 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
 The family panel was also designed, he said, to show "that we're going to turn 
values into policy and not just leave them as empty rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same press conference, likely Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Tex.) 
vowed that the House would work seven days a week and through the night if 
necessary to pass the "contract with America" in 100 days. Among other things, 
the GOP contract pledges to cut taxes, increase defense spending and pass a 
balanced-budget amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Gingrich met for 45 minutes with Dole. The two have never 
been close, and they represent not only generational differences in how to be a 
legislator but also ideological differences in their party. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little hint of that Monday, however. "If he has a bill and we have a 
bill, hopefully they will be the same," Dole said. "We need to coordinate 
whenever we can. That doesn't mean we are never going to disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Democrats, they began early skirmishing over who would lead the 
minority party in the House, and Senate. Rep. Charlie Rose (D-N.C.) announced 
that he would run for minority leader against outgoing Majority Leader Richard 
A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), longtime chairman of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, said he would challenge Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West 
Sacramento) for Democratic Caucus chairman. Rose and Mfume are considered 
underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, beleaguered Democrats pondered a change in leadership after the 
retirement of Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). Sen. Christopher J. 
Dodd (D-Conn.) told reporters this weekend that he would compete against Sen. 
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) for the spot.

GROUP ADVISES AGAINST TRAVEL IN SMALL PLANES 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An airline passenger group says small commuter airplanes should be avoided for 
safety reasons, but the airline industry, defending the small aircraft, said 
the warning issued Monday "needlessly frightens the public." 
</P>
<P>
 And Federal Aviation Administrator David R. Hinson said commuter airlines 
"have achieved and have sustained a high level of safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Airline Passengers Assn. urged its 110,000 members not to 
fly in planes with fewer than 31 seats, which it said have an accident rate 
"significantly higher" than larger craft. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Air Transport Assn., which represents airlines, responded that its 
members "continue to have confidence in the safety and operations procedures of 
their regional airlines partners." 
</P>
<P>
 The association said the warning "needlessly frightens the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The safety of short-haul commuter planes has been the focus of attention 
recently, particularly after the American Eagle crash in Indiana on Oct. 31 
that killed 68.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: ITO SUCCUMBS TO THE SIRENS OF CELEBRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The courthouse crowd is starting to call him "Judge Ego." 
</P>
<P>
 That might seem unfair to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, 
except for his nightly appearances this week on KCBS-TV Channel 2 Action News 
in an extended interview on the past, present and future of his favorite judge, 
Lance A. Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ito, who usually treats the press with contempt, is this week's star of 
the 11 o'clock news. The very same judge who last week displayed a copy of a 
cartoon portraying reporters as jackals is now, in the words of the KCBS 
advertisement, "face to face with Tritia Toyota" in "the interview everyone's 
waiting to see." 
</P>
<P>
 That's amusing in light of Ito's pretrial advice to fellow judges: "The sirens 
of mythology pale in comparison to the allure of seeing yourself on CNN. The 
results, however, can be about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of reporters are angry about what they see as Ito's hypocrisy, the way 
he had so eagerly become just another act in the Simpson media circus. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm more cynical than angry. Ito's spin on Ito showed that the judge -- so 
critical of coverage of the trial -- is just like everyone else, a sucker for a 
favorable story about himself. The man who scorned the media turns out to have 
been lusting for its attention. 
</P>
<P>
 His motives may have been innocent, but once he succumbed to the siren song of 
media attention he found -- like so many before him -- that things spun out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's debut occurred during one of television's most important nights -- a 
Sunday evening during the highly competitive sweeps month, when networks battle 
each other for viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS and its owner, the CBS network, had packaged the night with the skill of 
a good boxing promoter. The main event was the first episode of "Scarlett," the 
miniseries sequel to "Gone With the Wind." The show had received publicity and 
some good reviews. But if the viewers didn't like it, Scarlett's audience might 
melt away before the evening ended. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure the audience would stick around, KCBS needed what the fight 
promoters call a strong undercard. That's a popular fight staged after the main 
event. Its purpose is to keep the customers in the arena, buying beer, even if 
the main event is a dog. Judge Ito is KCBS' undercard. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a strong one. In his interview, Ito told a moving and inspirational story 
of his Japanese American family's journey from a World War II internment camp 
in Wyoming to the middle-class comfort and security of life in Los Angeles' 
Silver Lake district. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's heritage, it turns out, is a powerful force in his life. He told 
reporter Toyota that "I recall my parents wanted me to go to Japanese school . 
. . as you probably had your parents pressure you to spend four hours in 
Japanese school. As a third generation Californian, I rebelled against that . . 
. no one else in elementary school had to do that. . . . That ended after a 
long, intense battle of personalities with my parents and that's one of my 
bigger regrets, that I didn't follow through with that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his parents "never openly discussed" their years in the internment 
camp, where they, along with other American citizens of Japanese descent, were 
held prisoner through the war. "It was something they were very ashamed of and 
they have tried ever since to be good Americans in every sense of the word," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota asked, "Don't you think it's very sad that they had to feel ashamed 
they had to go through that terrible injustice when it wasn't even their fault? 
How does that affect you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it affects me in just about everything I do," Ito said. "Growing up, 
I knew my parents had been deprived of opportunity. My father graduated from 
the University of California at Berkeley. His academic plans to go on to 
medical school were stymied. . . . My mother . . . never had the opportunity to 
go to an excellent university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been to Germany on two occasions and have gone to some of the 
concentration camps," he said. He recalled the conditions of those camps and 
how he was reminded of the Japanese internment. "To see the barracks in Heart 
Mountain, Wyoming, and to see the same types of initial carvings and the types 
of human beings who lived there, the comparison is inescapable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the Sunday night news, Toyota said Ito had "turned me down several times" 
when she asked for an interview. She noted that judicial rules prevent judges 
from discussing their cases "so I agreed I would not ask him about the Simpson 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 This cast an aura of judicial sanctity about the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was in the thick of media madness. Full-page newspaper ads trumpeted 
his appearance. More promos appeared on the news. Sandwiched between the TV 
promos for Ito on the Sunday night news was a report about another prominent 
Simpson trial figure, defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro: "He has reportedly 
hired agent Ed Hookstratten to field possible offers for books and TV. Sources 
say two TV producers are interested in using Shapiro on a talk show." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, Ito. Ito, Shapiro. That's the way it looked on TV. By the time the 
judge's interview began, his boyhood recollections were mixed up in my mind 
with Shapiro's bid for a post-trial talk show job. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, not all the prospective jurors could avoid seeing the judge. In 
fact, the first one to be questioned by him Monday said he saw an Ito promotion 
on "Murder, She Wrote" earlier in the evening. "Well, it's sweeps week," 
explained the judge, referring to the period when ratings services measure the 
size of the stations' audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed to excuse everything. He didn't remove the prospective juror even 
though earlier he had removed one person for watching a Barbara Stanwyck 
western on cable television and another for waking to the sounds of a clock 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito excused them because he said the media was polluting the trial atmosphere 
and he wanted to protect the jurors from the electronic and printed poison. 
</P>
<P>
 He has emphasized the point with his tirades against the press, and his long 
colloquies with prospective jurors about the media's inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's on TV every night, and if he's not talking about the trial, you 
wouldn't know it from KCBS' promos for some of the segments: "Living in the 
spotlight of the trial of the century. . . . The man in the eye of a legal 
storm on the wrongs and the rights of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has kicked honest men and women off the jury panel for less. If publicity 
is so harmful to a fair trial, why is he participating in it?

BOARD EXPECTED TO EXIT EL TORO PLANNING PANEL; DEVELOPMENT: SUPERVISORS' VOTE 
TODAY ON WITHDRAWAL FROM THE REUSE AGENCY WOULD BE IN KEEPING WITH MEASURE A 
REQUIREMENT TO PLAN FOR A COMMERCIAL AIRPORT AT BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors is expected to vote today to withdraw 
from the agency charged with establishing a development plan for El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, leaving in doubt how building an airport there will proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are expected to approve a recommendation by County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider that they notify the El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority -- the official agency charged with drawing up a base 
conversion plan -- that the county will pull out by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with Schneider's recommendation said the supervisors are only 
expected to vote on the recommendation to withdraw and will not debate any 
options to replace the planning authority. Instead, supervisors have agreed to 
develop a new planning agency for the base before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agency would have to satisfy the Pentagon's requirement for community 
input in any development plan, while complying with voter-approved Measure A, 
which obligates the county to build a commercial airport at El Toro, assuming 
it takes over the property when the Marines leave by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The question asked by some observers Monday was what will happen to the 
nine-member El Toro Reuse Planning Authority board if the five supervisors 
withdraw, leaving three members from Irvine and one from Lake Forest as the 
only representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning agency has been working with the Pentagon for nearly eight months 
and is the official body recognized by Department of Defense officials to 
develop a reuse plan for the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond said the supervisors would be acting 
in bad faith if they abandon the planning agency. Under normal circumstances, 
the Board of Supervisors would be solely responsible for developing the Marine 
base, but the Pentagon demanded that Irvine and Lake Forest be included in the 
planning process, because they would be directly affected by any development 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board never wanted anybody else involved in the planning process. The 
only reason we got involved is because the Pentagon refused to give the county 
status and funds for planning unless Irvine and Lake Forest also had input," 
Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hammond seemed resigned to the breakup of the planning agency, he 
said there could still be a role for it. Measure A, which county voters 
approved last week, requires that the county establish a 13-member El Toro 
Airport Citizens Advisory Commission. Hammond suggested that this advisory 
group could be merged with the planning authority as the official airport 
planning group. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (El Toro Reuse Planning Authority) could change the land-use design to 
'airport,' and use the 13-member group to create an airport use plan. This 
could meet the Department of Defense's requirement for community involvement," 
Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miller, executive director of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, said 
the supervisors' Dec. 31 deadline for withdrawing from the planning agency 
would give them "some breathing room to decide whether to keep the ETRPA board 
as it is or modify its duties." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that you have the initiative (Measure A) that spells out 
certain things and specific guidelines from the (Pentagon)," Miller said. "The 
board will have to figure out how to go from ETRPA to a new advisory panel 
called for by Measure A without disrupting the planning process already in 
place and keep it at a smooth transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Brad Bartelt, a Marine spokesman, said the military worked well with the 
El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. However, he added that the military "will 
continue to work very closely with the recognized reuse authority established 
by the county." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's within their jurisdiction to pick a planning group, but it's too early 
to tell what's going to happen at our end," Bartelt said. "The only thing I can 
say for sure is that they will have to reapply for funding (from the Pentagon 
for planning studies)." 
</P>
<P>
 The planning study for El Toro was expected to cost about $2.2 million prior 
to the passage of Measure A. The Pentagon has already given the planning 
authority about $740,000 to pay for costs incurred through December.

BODIES OF KNOWLEDGE; OCC STUDENTS DISSECT CADAVERS TO PREPARE FOR CAREERS IN 
SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's a panic button inside the huge refrigerator where eight bodies are 
stored for scientific study at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the door closes and students get the heebie-jeebies, then they can just 
push it -- like this," demonstrates Kathleen Conroy, faculty coordinator of the 
student cadaver team that daily dissects human remains. 
</P>
<P>
 When she hits the button, the door opens swiftly, allowing a hasty exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those unfamiliar with the college's dissection lab who pass by it and see a 
body laid out on one of the stainless-steel tables almost always do a double 
take, said Sharon Daniel, a professor of biological sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most ask, 'Is it real? Are the bodies real?' " said Daniel, who with the help 
of associate professor Ann Harmer has made the class what it is today -- a 
success among science students interested in occupations in the medical field. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an independent honors class, the only one of its kind at an Orange 
County community college, where students can study damaged kidneys, blackened 
lungs and swollen livers -- training that goes beyond what a textbook can 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining body parts over the years, Conroy, 32, has come to an 
optimistic conclusion: "It's amazing what can go wrong but doesn't. It's 
amazing how many healthy people are walking around." 
</P>
<P>
 Paloma Robbins, 23, a newcomer to the 17-member class, is thinking about 
becoming a physician's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Rey Mojares, 23, has his sights set on medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 And 19-year-old Garrick Owen, fresh from Orange High School, said that genetic 
research could be in his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Tammie Keller, 22, a former OCC student who took the class and is 
now rewriting syllabuses for graduate students in physical therapy at Northern 
Arizona University in Flagstaff. She also helps dental students by exposing the 
cranial nerve system on human specimens so they can get a look at where all 
their numbing injections are going. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the class, I'd be nowhere," said Keller in a telephone 
interview. "You can't get the same experience anywhere around. There's nothing 
like it. I took 500 hours, and in the end it was so interesting, I couldn't 
keep away from it. It was a way of keeping my sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Not just any OCC student can waltz in and register for the cadaver prosection 
class, as it is officially known. They must be personally invited by 
professors, and a five-unit human anatomy class is a prerequisite. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also need a certain instinct and drive to learn more about the human 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dissecting preserved cats is a good preamble, but you don't really start 
learning until you've prosected a human body," Daniel said. "Before dissection 
was possible, surgery was extremely primitive. And the beauty of it all is that 
no two persons are alike, so you're always learning something different." 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies are provided by the UC Irvine and UC San Diego medical schools, 
which have willed body donation programs. Autopsies are not performed on the 
bodies, and once the dissection is completed and the students have logged all 
that they have learned in their journals, the medical schools pay for cremation 
and the scattering of ashes at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 What type of people donate their bodies for student exploration? 
</P>
<P>
 "They come from all walks of life," said William Collins, curator of 
anatomical preparation and plastination laboratories for UC San Diego's medical 
school. "Men, women, even entire families will donate, but you really don't 
know when your time is coming, so it's better to plan ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said older donors often remark that they have had such healthy lives 
and good medical care that willing their bodies to science is their way of 
giving something back. He said the donor program has two requirements -- that 
the donors be of average weight and height and that they do not die of a 
communicable disease, like AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But do the donors know that community college students, in some cases, will be 
performing rudimentary prosections? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, we're upfront with them," Collins said. "But most people who sign up 
for the program don't care; they just want their bodies to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 The donors remain anonymous, but students give the bodies nicknames. One is 
called "Jacques" because he was an oceanographer in life; another is "Master 
Poe," for no reason at all. A third is called "Vanna," and a fourth is called 
"Tiny." But students say they mean no offense; it is just their way of 
identifying the specimens, which is easier than using numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every student in this class is serious and appreciates and respects the human 
body," Conroy said.

INSURANCE MAGNATE ENDOWS BUSINESS CHAIR AT CHAPMAN; ACADEMIA: THE CONTRIBUTION 
FROM RALPH W. AND ELEANOR LEATHERBY BECOMES THE ORANGE UNIVERSITY'S FOURTH SUCH 
GIFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A retired, self-made insurance magnate who wants to share some of his business 
savvy with Chapman University students has given the school a $1.25-million 
endowment, officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators will use the gift from Ralph W. and Eleanor Leatherby to create 
a unique endowed chair in entrepreneurship, the third new endowed chair at 
Chapman in a year, campus officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When someone has been able to accomplish a great deal, this kind of an 
investment is a way they can share their perspective with others coming along," 
said Richard McDowell, dean of the School of Business and Economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Turk, 34, Chapman associate professor of management, was appointed to 
hold the teaching position, Chapman spokeswoman Ruth Wardwell said.  
</P>
<P>
 "As Chapman grows from a local county university to one that has national 
prominence, we realize that part of it is adding chairs," Chapman University 
President James. L. Doti said. "It's a hallmark of a great university." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1993, two separate gifts of more than $1 million each funded the 
Fletcher Jones chair in international business and the Delp Wilkinson chair in 
peace studies, Doti said. The Griset chair in religion was created in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman now has four endowed chairs, but Doti said: "I'm not going to rest 
until we have at least 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Through an endowed chair, administrators invest money given to the university 
and use the interest to pay for unique programs. The Leatherby gift will pay 
for teaching costs, about two new classes each term, speeches by business 
whizzes and events centered around burgeoning ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifts to Chapman grew dramatically over the past three years, university 
officials said. The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, for one, gave the 
university a $300,000 grant for science education in early November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our efforts certainly have been stepped up," said Paul Carey, Chapman 
director of development. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the university received $6.8 million in cash and pledges, and by 1993 
it received $10.1 million. Carey said the university's goal is $17 million in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leatherby gift will increase opportunities for faculty members to research 
better ways to run businesses and allow students more access to teaching about 
the organization and management of enterprises, Wardwell said. It will also 
support student internships with businesses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Leatherby, a member of Chapman's board of trustees, created the Leatherby 
Insurance Co., Orange County's largest insurance firm, Wardwell said. When he 
retired in 1975, his company was rated among the top 100 insurance firms in the 
country. He went on to found the UniCare Insurance Co. in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 As Leatherby chair, Turk will organize a business symposium in January, 
Wardwell said. The conference for students, faculty and local entrepreneurs 
will feature discussions about running enterprises in Southern California and 
providing business education for a global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Turk, a former instructor at Texas A & M University, has expertise in 
corporate strategy, Wardwell said. Turk earned a doctorate in strategic 
management from UC Irvine's business school in 1988 and joined Chapman in 1992. 
He lives in Yorba Linda.

CANDIDATES IN TWO TIGHT RACES SWEAT IT OUT; ELECTION: VICTORY IN CITY COUNCIL 
CONTESTS IN NEWPORT BEACH AND SANTA ANA HINGE ON THE TALLY WEDNESDAY OF 
ABSENTEE BALLOTS. IN ONE CLIFFHANGER, THE LEADER IS AHEAD BY ONLY 26 VOTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after the election, some city council races remain nail-biters as the 
Orange County registrar of voters tallies about 48,000 absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, new results could flop a 26-vote lead in Newport Beach or turn a 
150-vote Santa Ana victory on its head. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong uncertainty has proved emotionally trying for the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to hear the fat lady sing," said Alberta Christy, who has made two 
previous failed bids for Santa Ana City Council and is leading her opponent by 
150 votes. "I've been praying." 
</P>
<P>
 Christy, who was endorsed by the city's powerful police and fire associations, 
as well as the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, had trailed planning commissioner 
and part-time probation officer Tony Espinoza for much of election night. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she went home at about 1:30 a.m. several hundred votes behind 
Espinoza and stayed awake all night praying, oblivious to the fact that she had 
crept to the lead until her phone rang at 5:45 a.m. and the voice on the other 
end addressed her as "councilwoman." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, for his part, said he would be thrilled if the vote swung in his 
favor, but he phoned Christy last Thursday to congratulate her. He said he is 
prepared for the results to hold their present pattern.  
</P>
<P>
 "As for now, I feel she won the race. I felt this way that morning, and I've 
geared everything that I've felt since then to that," Espinoza said. "I don't 
think it's a real solid lead, but more or less I'm just preparing myself. I 
didn't want to be in suspense. I just figured the votes are cast. If anything 
changes, that will be great, but I just don't see it happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Christy so far has 14,535 votes to Espinoza's 14,385. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Deputy City Clerk William Navajo, there could be as many as 3,000 
Santa Ana absentee ballots still to be counted, although far fewer would 
pertain to the Christy-Espinoza ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, about 48,000 absentee ballots remain to be counted, Assistant 
Registrar Don Taylor said. Taylor had no city breakdowns, but said all anxiety 
would be laid to rest by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll run (the absentee ballots) on Wednesday. Then, we'll know how many and 
we'll know who won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newport Beach council race proved even more nerve-racking for the candidate 
who earned a 26-point lead and characterizes his life since then as 
"sleepless." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Winship received 10,804 votes to Thomas C. Edwards' 10,778. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's that iffy there's not much you can do about it," Winship said. 
"However, the tension still remains. All you can do is stay tense and just 
think good thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Winship recalled his roller-coaster ride on election night. First he was down 
250 votes, then up by 16. Then he crawled to an 88-point lead and slipped back 
down to his current 26-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "People I know were calling from all over the country to say, 
'Congratulations,' " he said. "Others called and said they were sorry I lost." 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife said it so perfectly," Winship said. "She said, 'You told me this was 
going to be over on Nov. 8.' And of course, it's just beginning. We were so 
into the campaigning trail, every time we see someone, we still think should we 
give them a pamphlet or a pen or a POG. We're still on automatic pilot."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; ATTEMPTED BREAK-INS PROMPT WARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents are being warned to keep their windows and doors locked at night 
after a series of early morning burglary attempts over the past five months, 
along with one incident in which a woman was threatened by a knife-wielding 
intruder in her bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's spokesperson Jan Sener said there have been at least 
five attempted break-ins since July, all in San Clemente east of the Interstate 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, residents have awakened in the morning to find doors and 
windows ajar. But last July, one San Clemente woman woke up to find a strange 
man in her house. 
</P>
<P>
 Sener said the man grabbed the woman from behind and threatened her with a 
knife before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sener said investigators aren't sure if the crimes are being committed by the 
same person. All of the break-in attempts have taken place between 1 and 5:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case, including the knife assault, residents had left their window or 
door open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many burglaries happen during the day," said Sener. "But these are occurring 
during the early morning hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the crimes is asked to call the San Clemente 
police investigations division at (714) 361-8220. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who want help to plan home security can contact Sener at (714) 
361-8213. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL BOARD TO CONSIDER LETTING BINGO PLAYERS 
SMOKE OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local bingo players may be allowed to keep smoking if the school board tonight 
takes advantage of a loophole in a new federal anti-smoking law. 
</P>
<P>
 But bingo players would have to step outside the school buildings to smoke, 
and the legal exemption would last for only six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo operators say most players will not attend games at the school if 
smoking is prohibited, and the result would be to eliminate a charity event 
that raises about $60,000 each year for high school instrumental music programs 
in the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Booster groups say the cost of renting other facilities is too high. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-smoking law -- part of the federal Goals 2000 public education 
legislation -- bans smoking on all public school property, whether or not 
students are present. 
</P>
<P>
 The law goes into effect Dec. 26 for school districts that have received 
federal funding for anti-smoking programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exemption applicable allows the district to temporarily permit 
smoking outside school buildings, school board President Michael B. Regele 
said. "There would still be an immediate ban on smoking inside buildings," he 
said. "A bingo player could step outside and smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Stalter, Irvine High School booster club vice president, said she would 
like to try continuing the games with smoking breaks for players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help us try to retain the players," Stalter said. "I think it will 
be fatal without having any smoking breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Margie Wakeham said smoking breaks may not prevent the 
exodus of players from local games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure whether the bingo operators will see this as a solution," 
Wakeham said. RUSS LOAR

 Who: Michael Stevens 
</P>
<P>
 Contribution: He has donated blood platelets to the American Red Cross 100 
times, becoming the first Orange County resident to hit the 100th mark in 
platelet donations. Stevens has been donating blood since 1984, when he donated 
platelets for a 5-year-old Anaheim girl. Platelets control bleeding by helping 
blood to clot and are given to chemotherapy and radiation patients, whose 
bodies don't produce enough. It takes twice as long to donate platelets as it 
does to give a regular blood donation.

 Reaching Out to Troubled Kids 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Huntington Beach Police Officers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Contribution: It donated $1,000 for the Outreach Center, which is scheduled to 
open in the downtown police substation in early 1995. The center will provide 
crisis intervention and parent education for youth and families. It is part of 
the Huntington Youth Shelter, a temporary residence for runaway and troubled 
youths. The shelter has helped more than 80 families since it opened in 
January. Shelter co-founder Carol Kanode said services will be provided by 
trained volunteers who will have completed a series of classes. Those 
interested in volunteering are asked to call (714) 847-KIDS. The association's 
donation will go toward buying training materials and supplies for the Outreach 
Center. Kanode said the center also received a $5,000 grant from McDonnell 
Douglas.

 Contribution: They provided round-the-clock food and drinks to firefighters 
during the October, 1993, Laguna Beach fire, which earned them an award from 
the Southern California Emergency Services Assn. The hotel also provided food 
at the Woodbridge High School Evacuation Center and offered free rooms to 
residents who had to leave their homes because of the fire. Hyatt employees set 
up a mobile restaurant at Turtle Rock Community Park for the emergency command 
center, serving food to firefighters.

 The city's four newly elected council members say they will strive to improve 
business, raise revenue to pay for services and reach accord on future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more business, more employees and certainly more sales tax revenues," 
said Dave Garofalo, 49, who has been involved in the community for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Reelected Councilman Ralph Bauer said that despite criticism of the current 
council as anti-business, "my attitude is, the way we've done business the last 
two years is the way it will stay -- reasonable, logical, fair-mannered and a 
very open type of government." Bauer, 64, is a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman-elect Shirley S. Dettloff, chairwoman of the Planning Commission 
and a business owner, said she has a strong commitment to the business 
community and wants to develop a closer relationship with merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Green, 68, a former mayor who was on the council from 1984 to 1992 and 
whom voters elected to a third term, said, "I think this present council will 
look at the business community and stimulate growth." 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WILDERNESS AREA WILL BE DOUBLED IN SIZE 
</P>

<P>
 The 930-acre Arroyo Trabuco wilderness area, one of the most active wildlife 
corridors in the county, will be twice as large as originally planned when it 
opens in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent grant of an additional 980 acres of open space by the Santa 
Margarita Co., outdoors enthusiasts will be able to enjoy hiking trails that 
stretch for up to 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've owned the land since 1983, yet we've never been able to open it to the 
public until now," county parks manager Tim Miller said. "The public will love 
this site." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arroyo Trabuco is an extension of O'Neill Regional Park, near the county's 
eastern foothills. The Santa Margarita Co. is giving up Tijeras Canyon and 
Chiquita Ridge to enlarge Arroyo Trabuco as a condition for developing the 
Rancho Santa Margarita and Las Flores communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilderness experts say the 1,900-acre preserve is like a wildlife freeway for 
large migratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've definitely got mountain lions, deer, wildcats, coyotes and raptors 
traveling through there," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gushing through the area is the Trabuco Creek, a major South County waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arroyo Trabuco is also home to a "magnificent stand of Sycamore trees," 
Miller said. "Some of them are hundreds of years old. These sycamores are part 
of the Orange County Heritage Tree program." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arroyo Trabuco opening will take place in either January or February, 
depending on the completion of a bridge that is part of the Foothill tollway 
under construction.FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COTO DE CAZA; 3.2-MILE STRETCH OF OSO PARKWAY TO OPEN

<P>
 A 3.2-mile extension of Oso Parkway will open Thursday, granting access to a 
wilderness park and the undeveloped southern portion of the Coto de Caza gated 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and representatives of the planned community will host 
ribbon-cutting ceremonies at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10-million project will give the public road access to Thomas F. Riley 
Wilderness Park, a 450-acre wilderness area that opens Dec. 10.It was formerly 
Wagon Wheel Canyon Regional Park and access to it was limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Coto officials plan to build up to 2,000 housing units in the south section of 
the development; the area currently has 1,500 homes. Construction is underway 
in some sections of the undeveloped area, called South Ranch at Coto, including 
an 18-hole championship golf course that will open in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The road project is part of the Foothill Circulation Phasing Plan, a 
cooperative venture between the county and developers to further build South 
County's street system. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension of Oso Parkway will intersect Coto de Caza Drive at the new 
entrance to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major arterials between Interstate 5 and the eastern communities of 
South County have opened in recent years, including extensions of Alicia 
Parkway and Oso Parkway. FRANK MESSINA

 The city and the sanitary district will divide the $5,000 annual cost of 
hiring a part-time code enforcement officer to watch out for dozens of 
scavengers who sift through residents' trash, a growing problem in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the sanitary district board agreed to split the cost at the 
district's meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed to print stickers saying "Scavenging Is Illegal" and place 
them on the sides of the city's trash-hauling trucks and on residents' garbage 
cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signs will be real basic but real clear," said Florine Reichle, assistant 
manager of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs will also be printed in English, Spanish and Vietnamese -- and made 
available at City Hall in the next 10 days, Reichle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitary district hopes the new code enforcement officer, to be hired by 
the end of the month, and the stickers will help put a stop to what has become 
a thriving industry that has upset some city residents, according to Reichle.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; ACTIVIST'S LOSS AT POLLS COULD BE BLESSING

<P>
 Rose Hernandez Espinoza's election defeat in the Proposition 187 tidal wave 
may have been a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, who last week lost her bid for a City Council seat, is stepping up 
the volunteer work she loves with a passion: providing tutoring services to 
needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for her 3-year-old after-school garage tutoring program, Espinoza said 
the service will be in greater demand should Proposition 187 be upheld in the 
courts. The initiative would deny public education to illegal immigrants, 
causing some of her pupils and many other children to be barred from school. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many more garage schools will be needed," she said, vowing to get her 
program, Motivating Adolescents to Succeed (MAS), duplicated in all La Habra 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the makeshift schools will help keep youths interested in learning 
and out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, 42, believes her outspoken opposition to Proposition 187 was partly 
to blame for her loss at the polls, but she said she will never stop helping 
youths, especially now. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the only City Council candidate to publicly oppose the proposition at 
a forum televised several times before the election. She had made it known that 
she believed the initiative was "inhumane, cruel, unjust and unfair to 
children." Her opponents took no stand on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret opposing 187, because it is wrong," Espinoza said, explaining 
her narrow defeat as "a backlash for being against 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza came in third in a field of five candidates for two seats on the 
council. There was only 1% difference in her vote and that of second place 
vote-getter Mayor David M. Cheverton. Most votes went to community activist 
Dorothy May Rush. She and Cheverton begin their four-year terms in December. 
Espinoza said she may run again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she is organizing a dinner dance Nov. 27 at Our Lady of Guadalupe 
Church to raise money for MAS and is inviting the public to attend and lend a 
helping hand. MIMI KO

 Don't expect a dramatic building boom in Garden Grove.

<P>
 The city is expected to see modest growth in the number of housing units over 
the next 25 years, according to estimates by the city's Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1995 and 2000, single-family homes and multiple-family dwellings will 
increase by just a little more than 500 units, based on a county projection. 
Currently, there are about 46,300 housing units in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2020, officials estimate the city will have about 50,000 housing units.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; COUNCIL PLANS TO REVIEW TODAY QUALITY OF 
PARAGON CABLE SERVICE 
</P>

<P>
 Customers of Paragon Cable will have a chance to tell City Council members 
whether they are satisfied with the service. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing today, council members will evaluate the cable company's 
performance over the past three years, including compliance with Federal 
Communications Commission's guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 federal law gives local governments the authority to set rates for 
various levels of cable television services and the use of equipment, such as 
remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have hired a consultant, Telecommunications Management Corp., 
to review Paragon's rates. The consultant's report will be discussed at the 
public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's cable ordinance and franchise agreement with Paragon, the 
cable company's services will be evaluated five times over 15 months. Today's 
hearing will be the fourth of five such evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Paragon has complied substantially with the cable 
ordinance and franchise agreement, including technical and financial 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Among these requirements are that 90% of customer calls are answered within 
four rings, that about 90% do not have to wait more than 30 seconds to reach a 
service representative, that an emergency toll-free telephone line be available 
24 hours and that repair crews be available for major repairs around the clock.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CARROZZO IS EXPECTED TO GET TURN AS 
MAYOR

<P>
 Councilman Guy Carrozzo, who spent $834 on his campaign for reelection, is 
expected to become the city's new mayor Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the date the council is scheduled to hold its annual reorganization 
meeting. Carrozzo, who was among three incumbents reelected last week, is in 
line for the ceremonial seat that is rotated among council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo, 62, refused to accept contributions as he sought his second 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Reelected along with Carrozzo were Mayor John Collins and Councilwoman Laurann 
Cook. They defeated the lone challenger, Gus Ayer. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing the coming year, the board members said the key challenges will 
be confronting crime and balancing the city's budget with declining revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might be faced with more fiscal responsibility -- and maybe even more belt 
tightening," said Collins, especially if the state cut backs revenues to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Ayer's failed bid to get elected, he plans to continue his civic 
involvement and will work at getting council meetings televised on cable and on 
improving athletic fields for youth sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook was returned to office for a third, consecutive term. Incumbents agreed 
that her reelection settled the term limitation issue in the city and showed 
voters are satisfied with the city's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, 45, who spent about $10,000 on her campaign, said: "I am delighted in 
the confidence voters have placed in me by reelecting me. It puts to rest the 
term limitation question." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the city's voters passed a two-term limit. But term limits are not 
valid in general-law cities, such as Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, 51, who spent $8,000 on his campaign, also said that it is no 
surprise that the incumbents are back in their seats: "As I walked precincts, 
people are happy with the way the city is run and appreciate the effort of the 
local government." DEBRA CANO

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members are weighing whether to appoint Tony Ingegneri to the 
council when Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater becomes mayor, rather than hold a 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingegneri, 36, a businessman and member of the Planning Commission, finished 
third among the 12 candidates who vied for two council seats in last week's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may fill a council vacancy by appointment instead of holding a 
special election, City Clerk Carolyn Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Morris said, a special election could cost the city as much as 
$70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, we would bring up the next guy," said Broadwater, who bested 
four other mayoral candidates last week, including Councilman Ho Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 Although filling the council vacancy is not on the agenda for the council's 
meeting today, Broadwater said the appointment could be discussed, and a 
decision probably made when the council meets again Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadwater, who won a council seat in 1992, will succeed Mayor Frank Kessler, 
who did not seek reelection after one term. Broadwater will serve for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes, who captured the most votes last week in winning a 
second term, said he would prefer that voters decide on the new councilman, but 
that a special election would be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyes supported Ingegneri during the campaign, and both were endorsed by the 
Garden Grove Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be unanimous," said Councilman Robert F. Dinsen of 
Ingegneri's possible appointment. "We can't go against the wishes of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinsen, who has been on the council since 1980, won a fourth four-year term 
last week. BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City councilwoman-elect Margie L. Rice says she will work to repeal a 5% 
utility tax imposed in 1986 and seek to lower water rates when she joins the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 After two previous unsuccessful attempts, Rice, 65, emerged the top 
vote-getter among the three candidates who vied for two seats on the council in 
last week's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayers should have a relief," said Rice, who used the repeal of the 
utility tax as the main issue of her campaign. "It's been there for years. We 
were told it was only for a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said she would also ask for a review of the water rates, which have been 
raised twice this year, including 72 cents in June that brought the monthly 
water bill of the average Westminster household to about $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Brian Mayhew said the utility tax generates about $3.6 
million a year, and the city would be hard-pressed to find another source of 
income if it is repealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any tax can be repealed; any water rate can be lowered," Mayhew said. "It's 
up to the policy-makers to make the decision. But how many cops do you want to 
get rid off? Where are you going to make the cuts?" 
</P>
<P>
 He said the water rate increases were necessary to help pay back an 
$8.5-million bond issued in July that was used to buy automatic meter readers, 
improve water wells and pay off debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lam, who finished second behind Rice in last week's election, said that 
it would be difficult to repeal the utility tax and lower water rates because 
of the city's "not-too-rosy financial situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to talk than actually do something about it," Lam said. "We 
should look for ways to cut cost and generate sales tax dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Craig Schweisinger failed to win reelection, finishing 281 votes 
behind Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Charles V. Smith, who ran unopposed, won a fourth two-year term. BERT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; BOARD TO CONTINUE CHARTER SCHOOL STUDY

<P>
 Orange Unified School District trustees have committed themselves to further 
study of the controversial privatizing of schools, despite earlier protests 
from unions and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The board last week urged more district schools to go forward with the 
charter-school process, which would free them from state control.The trustees 
agreed to sponsor workshops for administrators, teachers and parents to help 
them understand the charter concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also discussed seeking waivers for the district from portions of the 
state code. "I think it would be an outstanding idea for the district to show 
the state that parts of the education code are unnecessary and a burden to 
education," trustee Bill Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Clayton H. Parker briefed the trustees on what to expect if they 
decide to pursue waivers from the state code or try for a full-scale chartering 
of local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say you should prepare yourself like you're preparing for trial," he 
said.

 A lengthy legal analysis from Parker's Tustin firm outlined educational areas 
subject to waivers and those that could be changed by the charter school 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation, custodial jobs, food and health services are to some extent 
open to private contracting, Parker said. But any contracting out of teaching 
or administrative posts would have to go through the charter process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the district's schools, Santiago Middle, is to open as a charter school 
next fall. Parker noted that the Santiago school had the blessing of the 
teaching staff -- a legal necessity and a crucial element in the often 
contentious school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Robert L. French noted that the district would have to provide 
alternative public school instruction to any resident who requested it if all 
37 schools went charter, "and that could be very costly."LESLEY WRIGHT

CHECKPOINT BACK IN BUSINESS; MORE THAN 150 INTERCEPTED; IMMIGRATION: BORDER 
PATROL POST HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR SIX WEEKS BUT WILL REMAIN OPEN AT LEAST UNTIL 
FEBRUARY.

 Border Patrol officials said Monday that they intercepted more than 150 people 
trying to enter the country illegally at the San Clemente checkpoint, which 
reopened Sunday after being closed for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's average," said Ted Swofford, assistant Border Patrol agent."We were 
productive, and it's good to get back into operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials estimate that 110,000 vehicles a day pass through the 
four-lane checkpoint, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite heavy weekend traffic that caused minor delays Sunday, officials say 
they do not expect daily traffic to be delayed more than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a problem at all," Swofford said. "Not any more so than it was two 
months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few hours of its reopening, Border Patrol agents also stopped a 
vehicle carrying 654 pounds of marijuana and arrested two men. 
</P>
<P>
 All 93 San Clemente Border Patrol agents have returned from the Imperial Beach 
station by the border to the checkpoint along Interstate 5, Swofford said. To 
take their place at the border are more than 80 new Border Patrol agents. 
Another 150 agents are also on their way there, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The station will operate until February, when it will close for two weeks 
before reopening again. At that time, Immigration and Naturalization Service 
officials are expected to decide whether the checkpoint is effective enough to 
be kept open, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think we're better at the (San Clemente) checkpoint," he said. 
"A defensive squad on a football team does not put all their people on one 
line. We need the secondary line of defense."

WOMAN KILLED WHEN EJECTED FROM CAR IN FREEWAY WRECK; PASSENGER IS UNHURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman was killed Sunday night when her speeding car went out of control and 
plunged down a freeway embankment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials identified the woman as Lupe Hernandez, 24, of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said she was thrown from the Toyota Corolla when it careened over the 
embankment, hit a tree and rolled over near the Riverside Freeway east of 
Lakeview Avenue. Hernandez was not wearing a seat belt, said CHP spokeswoman 
Officer Angel Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was driving west at about 80 m.p.h. when she lost control, Johnson 
said. Police are investigating whether Hernandez was intoxicated, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-year-old passenger, Valerie Salomon of Anaheim, was unhurt in the 9 p.m. 
crash. The girl, who was wearing a seat belt, is the sister of Hernandez's 
boyfriend, Johnson said.

KEVORKIAN LICENSE HEARING FRIDAY; MEDICINE: PHYSICIAN DUBBED 'DR. DEATH' IS 
ASKING COURTS TO RESTORE HIS RIGHT TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH HE LOST IN 
PART FOR ASSISTING IN THE SUICIDE OF A COSTA MESA MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Kevorkian, dubbed "Dr. Death" for assisting in 21 suicides, including 
that of a Costa Mesa man, will seek reinstatement of his California medical 
license at a court hearing Friday, state officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California voted to revoke Kevorkian's license in July, 
citing among other cases that of cancer patient Jonathan Grenz, an Orange 
County real estate agent and one of two Californians who traveled to 
Kevorkian's home state of Michigan to obtain help in committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Thomas Lazar said Monday that the case involving Grenz 
helped form the cornerstone of the state's evidence against Kevorkian, who 
obtained a California medical license in 1957 and worked at two hospitals in 
Long Beach from 1979 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Grenz, 44, was found to have cancer in 1992, and doctors removed his voice box 
and tongue. But at the time he committed suicide with Kevorkian's help, he had 
recovered from the cancer, according to testimony from a friend and co-worker, 
Linda Healy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, 66, was later charged with murder in Michigan, where authorities 
cited his having assisted in the suicides of Grenz and Martha Ruwart, 40, of 
Cardiff by the Sea, whose duodenal cancer had invaded her small intestine and 
ovaries with numerous tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's hearing will be in Los Angeles Superior Court. Kevorkian has also 
filed suit in U.S. District Court, alleging that California's revocation of his 
medical license constitutes a violation of his civil rights. That matter will 
be heard in Los Angeles on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Michigan Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on a variety of 
cases affecting Kevorkian, whose medical license has been suspended in his home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned the state law designed to 
stop Kevorkian's practice of assisted suicide but ordered murder charges 
reinstated against him. The Michigan Supreme Court then agreed to hear the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Kevorkian as a co-plaintiff in the federal court case is an 
unidentified Los Angeles man who is dying of AIDS and who protests California's 
ban on physician-assisted suicide, according to Kevorkian's Los Angeles 
attorney, Mark Field, who noted that the man is not a client of Kevorkian's. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this principle California follows applies to everybody," Field said, "not 
just Jack Kevorkian. It prevents everyone in California from being able to 
control the timing and dignity of their death. It forces them to suffer and 
deprives them of any meaningful control over the end of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kevorkian's California license, Field said, "obviously, we feel the 
state was wrong. Otherwise, we wouldn't have challenged it in Superior Court. 
Aside from that, we feel a sense of puzzlement. Why did the California Medical 
Board feel it necessary to jump into a dispute that's being handled entirely in 
Michigan, where each of the 21 suicides has taken place? Why is it California's 
business?" 
</P>
<P>
 California and Michigan were the only states in which Kevorkian was licensed 
to practice medicine. Under California law, Kevorkian had the right to protest 
the suspension and later the revocation of his license through the 
administrative law process. 
</P>
<P>
 But at numerous hearings in San Diego, he failed to attend or send a 
representative, choosing instead to pursue the matter in state and federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the state's contention, according to Deputy Atty. Gen. Lazar, is that 
Kevorkian had the right to protest the suspension and revocation by "exhausting 
administrative remedies before the Medical Board." His decision to reject those 
options is grounds for dismissal, Lazar said.

PRISONER DIES IN COUNTY JAIL WHILE SUFFERING FROM HEROIN WITHDRAWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old inmate suffering from heroin withdrawal died early Monday in the 
Orange County Jail after complaining he felt ill, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoner, whose name was being withheld until family members could be 
notified, told deputies about 5 a.m. that he had vomited and felt sick.On his 
way to the jail's medical floor, he slumped over in a wheelchair and became 
unconscious, Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was rushed to the medical triage area and treated by medical staffers 
and paramedics. He was pronounced dead by 6 a.m., Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death and an investigation 
planned by the Orange County district attorney's office, which probes all jail 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the man, who was booked into the jail last Friday on a bench 
warrant for drug sales, was withdrawing from heroin.

NATIONAL LATINO VOTER GROUP BEGINS MEMBERSHIP DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A national nonpartisan Latino voter education organization will make its first 
public appearance Wednesday to begin a membership drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has been invited to attend a dinner reception at the Center Club in 
Costa Mesa and become members of LAVA, or Latin American Voters of America, a 
nonprofit group dedicated to providing civic and voter education. 
</P>
<P>
 LAVA has spent the past two years researching voter trends, demographics and 
issues. The research has indicated that Latinos are the most underrepresented 
at the polls, and LAVA's goal is to "dramatically increase the number of Latino 
voters in all elections," said LAVA president Jess J. Araujo, a Santa Ana 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as citizens have a duty to vote," he said. "We don't care how you vote, we 
just care that you vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner will be from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. County and city officials will 
present proclamations commending LAVA, Araujo will deliver the keynote address 
focusing on LAVA's mission and Cal State Fullerton Prof. Isaac Cardenas will 
discuss Latino voting trends. The club is at 650 Town Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Members will be asked to pay $25 for general membership or $150 to become 
"founding members," whose names will be inscribed on a plaque and displayed at 
LAVA's national headquarters in Santa Ana. Proceeds will be used to continue 
LAVA's efforts to educate people about the importance of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately (voting) benefits our entire country," Araujo said. "Our motto is: 
Democracy works best when everyone votes. . . . Our focus will initially be on 
the Latino community because the statistics say they are the least 
represented."

CHRYSLER'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER WANTS MORE; AUTOS: KERKORIAN PROPOSES INCREASING 
HIS STAKE TO 15% FROM 9%, BUT ASKS THE COMPANY TO RAISE THE STOCK'S VALUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, already Chrysler Corp.'s largest 
shareholder, said Monday that he wants to increase his 9% stake in the auto 
maker to as much as 15%, and urged the company to take several steps to bolster 
the value of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian, a reclusive, 76-year-old wheeler-dealer known for complex 
transactions in the entertainment and airline fields, recommended that Chrysler 
undertake a stock buyback program, increase its dividend and institute a 
2-for-1 stock split. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recommended that Chrysler drop its "poison pill" provisions. In order 
for Kerkorian to significantly increase his stock holdings, Chrysler would have 
to get rid of the provision that discourages the accumulation of 10% or more of 
its shares by one person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the company's excellent operating performance in recent years, the 
company's stock price performance has been very disappointing," Kerkorian wrote 
in a letter to Chrysler's board.  
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler officials declined to comment on the specifics of Kerkorian's letter. 
"Chrysler will consider these requests as it considers the requests of all 
stockholders," company spokeswoman Rita McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Chrysler, in which he praised and chastised management, 
Kerkorian set a Dec. 15 deadline for Chrysler's board to adopt his 
recommendations, which he indicated had been rebuffed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, he would exercise other options, including filing a lawsuit to get 
rid of the poison pill and possibly launching a hostile takeover, said Alex 
Yemenidjian, an executive with Tracinda Corp., Kerkorian's operating company. 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts said a takeover effort is unlikely because of the high cost 
and because Kerkorian has little expertise in the auto industry. They said his 
purpose appears to be driving the stock price higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian's actions pushed Chrysler's stock up $3.125 a share to close at $49 
in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock fell last week amid 
speculation that Kerkorian would sell his Chrysler shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian, who has moved most of his operations from Beverly Hills to Las 
Vegas, has a history of challenging management. He once held major stakes in 
Columbia Pictures and now-defunct Western Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 He made millions in a complex web of deals involving entertainment company 
MGM/UA. Most recently he built the MGM Grand Hotel, the largest casino-hotel in 
the world, and purchased a 5% stake in entertainment company Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian amassed his large holding in Chrysler in 1990 when the company was 
struggling to stay afloat and its stock traded at about $12 a share. He paid 
about $272 million for his Chrysler shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Kerkorian's stake is worth about $1.5 billion. But that is down about 
$500 million from January, when Chrysler's stock hit a high of $63.50. The 
stock has since fallen on fears of interest rate hikes and expectations that 
the current boom in U.S. auto sales has peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 His initial investment in Chrysler came after he met and became friends with 
then-Chairman Lee Iacocca. Kerkorian said his was a long-term investment in 
Chrysler, but there were doubters. 
</P>
<P>
 He balked at agreeing not to accumulate more Chrysler stock in 1990. The board 
-- worried about the risk of a hostile takeover while the company's market 
value was so low -- lowered its poison pill threshold to 10% from 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this provision, if an investor accumulates 10% or more of the stock, 
other investors are granted new stock that in effect dilutes the stake of the 
accumulating investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian noted that Chrysler is the only auto maker to have a poison pill. He 
also said it is a more onerous one than those of other large companies where 
the threshold is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the company's poison pill is unlawful, inappropriate and 
contrary to the shareholder's best interest," Kerkorian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that with Chrysler's improved financial position -- its market 
capitalization now exceeds $18 billion -- the need for a poison pill is 
diminished because the likelihood of a hostile takeover is remote. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Kerkorian's concern may have less to do with buying more stock than 
a worry that his proposed stock repurchase program could cause the poison pill 
to kick in. Kerkorian is urging the company to undertake a "meaningful share 
repurchase program" over the next year. He also wants the company to undertake 
a stock split, which could make Chrysler shares more accessible to more 
investors, and to raise its stock dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect Chrysler, which has earned $2.2 billion in the first nine 
months of 1994, to increase its current $1 annual dividend to $1.50 in 1995 and 
perhaps to $2 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kerkorian's agenda could disrupt the strategy of Chrysler Chairman Robert 
Eaton, who has been trying furiously to strengthen the company's balance sheet 
before the next economic downturn.KERKORIAN, KIRK

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SOME AT SONY SEE GUBER'S WISH LIST LEAVING 
THEM HOLDING BAG OF COAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Sony Pictures Entertainment tries to break out of its box office morass and 
move into a brighter future, some executives are still feeling haunted by the 
ghost of Sony past. 
</P>
<P>
 They allege that ex-Chairman Peter Guber, who left two months ago, is trying 
to circumvent management and snatch some of Sony's most promising projects for 
his own production company. Specifically rattling their chains are reports that 
Guber plans to lay claim to six or seven development projects at Sony's 
Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's caused a lot of anger," said one source. "It's a bit of a quagmire." 
</P>
<P>
 Guber, who has moved out of the chairman's suite and into director Francis 
Ford Coppola's old offices on Sony's Culver City lot, denied in a brief 
interview doing anything to cause alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has no intention of cherry-picking material and that all major 
creative decisions are on hold until he returns from a six-week vacation. But 
Guber defended his right to transfer to his new company "some" movie projects 
that he helped develop as chairman at Sony.  
</P>
<P>
 Guber also asserted that his production deal gives him an unusually large 
degree of autonomy at Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one here is in charge of me, if that's the question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hyperkinetic executive, who ran Sony Pictures for five years, was always a 
lightning rod for controversy. Some saw the company's massive early 
expenditures on movies, staffing and facilities as a direct reflection of 
Guber's go-go style. Guber said the moves were necessary to re-establish 
Columbia and TriStar as serious players, but he was ultimately undone by the 
poor performance of movies such as "Last Action Hero" and steady executive 
defections. 
</P>
<P>
 When he resigned in late September, Guber said he planned to form his own 
company with partial financing from Sony. Sources speculate that Sony has 
pledged roughly $200 million in start-up money to the unnamed company. Guber is 
also said to be seeking outside investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "His deal specifies that there may be certain things he's entitled to, or 
empowered to do," said one knowledgeable executive. "But that's an awkward way 
to do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony formally declined to comment on Guber, except to say on background that 
the relationship is running smoothly. But Guber's company is said to be a 
source of growing tension with Sony Pictures President Alan J. Levine, who 
inherited most of Guber's duties, and Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Cos. 
Chairman Mark Canton, who stands to lose control of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources refused to identify all of the material on Guber's wish list. But he 
is said to be mostly interested in TriStar properties, including "Elephants," a 
well-known project based on the true story of a circus performer who steals 
back two elephants he has sold to pay off his debts when he subsequently learns 
that they are being mistreated by their new owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Any transfer of projects to Guber would be taken as a slap in the face by the 
executives who developed the material. It's too soon to say how things will 
play out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Levine and Canton are in the dark about the full extent of Guber's 
authority. Canton has privately promised colleagues that he will turn back any 
poaching efforts, and both executives have reportedly complained to Sony of 
America President Michael P. Schulhof, who negotiated Guber's exit agreement. 
Levine and Canton were en route to New York for corporate meetings on Monday, 
but it was unclear if Guber is on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's latest release, the disappointing "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," was a 
pet project of Guber's. Other losers this year include "I'll Do Anything" and 
"North." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Guber's resignation, executives have tried to put a better face on the 
company. Sony has stepped up production and is more aggressively bidding for 
material. On Monday, it also consolidated its three companies -- Columbia, 
TriStar and Triumph Releasing -- under one Sony Pictures distribution banner, 
which will give the company a higher market share rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber insists all the Sturm und Drang is unwarranted. He says he's "not even 
close" to completing his financing plan or to deciding how to proceed with his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I'm not doing anything until after my vacation," he said. "That's 
when I will begin to formulate my plans, decide what my entry point is, how I 
populate my company and what I do with my life. . . . But right now, I'm only 
dealing with me."

appointment as the new chairman of Warner Bros. Records and President Lenny

MICROSOFT GETS INTO ON-LINE DERBY WITH NEW SERVICE; TECHNOLOGY: GATES SAYS 
NETWORK WILL MAKE IT EASIER AND CHEAPER FOR COMPUTER USERS TO GET ACCESS TO ALL 
THAT INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates on Monday formally presented his concept 
of the electronic community: an on-line service called Microsoft Network that 
he hopes will do for the booming information-access business what Windows did 
for technophobic computer users. 
</P>
<P>
 At a luncheon for reporters and industry analysts at the Comdex computer trade 
show here, Gates said the new service "will make it easy and inexpensive" for 
users to browse the Internet, send electronic mail and call up news and other 
information. It will be launched as part of Microsoft's new personal computer 
operating system, Windows 95, which is scheduled to ship by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Microsoft has become the dominant player in the PC universe by 
selling stand-alone software, Gates sees the industry's future hinging on 
innovative communications and information services that go beyond anything now 
offered on the emergent information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just movies on demand, it's not just computing," Gates said in his 
keynote speech here. By 2005, he said, communications, interactive commerce, 
interactive entertainment and computer-assisted delivery of health care and 
other government services will fundamentally change the way people live, and 
the PC industry as it is known today will seem like a quaint relic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Microsoft intends to use its dominance of the PC software industry today 
to help it carve out a big role in the information industry of tomorrow. The 
Microsoft Network, previously known in the industry by its code name Marvel, 
will play a central role in that strategy -- and on-line competitors are 
understandably nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers of Windows 95 will be able to subscribe directly to the service with 
the click of a mouse, and they will have ready access to customer support. That 
could give the Redmond, Wash., company a big advantage in winning market share 
from rivals such as CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors are already taking action. Prodigy, a venture of IBM Corp. and 
Sears, Roebuck & Co., last month reduced prices and improved its Internet 
offerings. America Online of Vienna, Va., hopes to induce some of its "content 
providers," including magazine publishers and TV networks, to agree to 
exclusive arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say Microsoft's entry could end up being be a boon to the entire 
on-line industry. Andy Bose, a vice president of Link Resources, a New York 
consulting firm, says Microsoft's marketing savvy and marketplace strength will 
probably result in more innovation, reinvigorating demand for on-line services. 
That, in turn, should help create a far bigger market for the services, which 
Gates said has been hampered by arcane "user interfaces" and a lack of 
compelling offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 By year-end, Bose estimates, on-line subscriptions will total 5.4 million, a 
number Microsoft expects to double or quadruple in quick order. But Bose added 
that the company will have to be careful for antitrust reasons, since its 
network will clearly gain from the near-monopoly position enjoyed by Windows. 
The Justice Department has already delayed Microsoft's proposed acquisition of 
Intuit Inc., the innovative leader in personal finance software that could be 
an important service provider on the Microsoft Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Siegelman, Microsoft's general manager of on-line services, noted that 
Windows 95 users will be able to choose any on-line service and won't be 
limited to Microsoft Network. He added that America Online and others have "all 
kinds of ways to distribute" their services, including free trial diskettes 
contained in many computer magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to Microsoft's initial success, Siegelman said, will be a low monthly fee 
and a low hourly connection fee for users. (He declined to provide specifics, 
but industry observers have speculated that Microsoft's fee will be perhaps 
half the $8 to $10 that other companies charge per month for basic service.) 
AT&T will provide telecom access for the network, and Digital Equipment was 
selected to provide computer support. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, the key will be content. Siegelman said Microsoft is 
offering newspaper and magazine publishers and other information companies very 
generous terms, including freedom to set prices and to determine how their 
products will look on line. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many content providers are wary of Microsoft's power and are reportedly 
driving a hard bargain.

WRAPPED UP IN OPTIMISM; RETAILERS EXPECTING A BIG HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, as voters they might be discontent. But as shoppers, Americans are 
expected to open their wallets wider this holiday shopping season. The nation's 
retailers have prepared themselves with bulging inventories in anticipation of 
what various polls and prognostications suggest may be the richest year-end 
shopping spree in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence is a national survey released Monday that shows widespread 
optimism among retailers about prospects for this holiday season. The survey -- 
sponsored by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche -- said 77% of retailers 
expect higher sales at their stores, compared to the 62% who expected increases 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey indicates that Southern California retailers are even more 
optimistic about their holiday prospects. The survey shows that 83% expect 
higher sales, compared to just 48% who expected increases last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Deloitte & Touche survey shows a more upbeat view among retailers 
than among consumers -- and other samplings have painted a mixed picture -- the 
consensus among executives and experts who track consumer behavior is for 
spending increases of anywhere from 5% to 10%. They say it is a simple 
reflection of a strengthened economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers are more positive because there is less unemployment," said Allen 
Questrom, chairman of the Federated Department Store chain. "We expect a good 
holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday shopping surveys attract attention because they are often an indicator 
of consumer confidence. And this holiday season holds the potential to 
accelerate or stall the current economic recovery during the final 45 shopping 
days of the year, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deloitte & Touche findings are based on responses from 1,014 retailers and 
1,005 consumers nationwide. They are more optimistic than a recent Gallup Poll 
sponsored by the International Mass Retail Assn., which also turned up evidence 
that people plan to spend more this year, if only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Deloitte & Touche survey results were similarly more upbeat 
than other groups' attempts to predict holiday retail sales -- and were closer 
to the mark, as a late-season buying surge made 1993 the most profitable 
holiday season for retailers in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumer attitudes are much more positive than last year," said Harvey Braun, 
co-chairman of the Trade Retail & Distribution Services Group of Deloitte & 
Touche in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, consumers plan to spend an average of $714 this holiday season, an 
11% increase over last year's average of $646, the survey found. Consumers in 
the West plan to spend an average of $659, up 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gallup survey predicted average nationwide spending of $700 per consumer 
this year, compared to $685 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Federal Reserve Board report on economic conditions also said 
retailers in most of the country are optimistic about holiday retail sales 
growth. In addition, some credit card companies are expanding credit levels, to 
the delight of retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, demand for apparel will generate much of the additional spending 
this year, said Questrom, whose Federated operates Bloomingdale's and is 
nearing the final stages of a merger with R.H. Macy & Co., operator of 
Bullock's and I. Magnin.  
</P>
<P>
 Questrom predicts that designer apparel and children's clothing with symbols 
and logos from television's "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and Disney's movie 
"The Lion King" will be big sellers. Bullock's and other department stores also 
expect luggage, cookware and home furnishings to be popular this holiday 
season, Questrom said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Major retailers have already acted on such forecasts. Kmart spokesman Ron 
Pauli said his chain's inventories are "well-balanced to take advantage of 
stronger consumer demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Stores at Century City Shopping Center in Los Angeles are also stocking more 
heavily in anticipation of a brisk season. Doug Roscoe, the center's general 
manager, said merchants expect menswear, consumer electronics and home 
furnishings to be top sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our tenants are expecting gains in the 12% range," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Westminster Mall in Orange County, most stores are already reporting strong 
customer traffic and increased sales over last year, marketing manager 
Stephanie Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing people buying more . . . big-screen TVs, luxury personal items, 
high-tech electronic products and the like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the Glendale Galleria expect a 5% to 10% sales increase for the 
last 45 days of the year. Sales at the Westside Pavilion could jump as much as 
15% over last year, mall marketing director Mary Lankester said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Greg Johnson in Orange County contributed to this report. 
Holiday Sales Outlook 
</P>
<P>
 Most forecasters see strong holiday retail sales this year as the economic 
recovery continues, with spending in the West--dominated by 
Californians--weaker than elsewhere. But one survey finds retailers markedly 
more optimistic than consumers' plans would suggest: 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers and retailers are showing more confidence in spending... 
</P>
<P>
 What consumers say they'll spend and what retailers expect: 
</P>
<P>
 Spend more:

COMPANY TOWN; 'SANTA CLAUSE' GREATLY IMPROVES TIM ALLEN'S STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like an early Christmas for Tim Allen. The comedian has scored a rare 
triple play with the top-rated TV show in ABC's "Home Improvement," a 
best-selling book and this weekend's second-highest-grossing movie, Disney's 
"The Santa Clause." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that success, Allen seems poised to become one of Hollywood's most 
bankable comedic stars. On its opening weekend, "The Santa Clause" grossed $20 
million at the box office, making it the third-best premiere for a Walt Disney 
film in history. Moreover, Allen scored in his first time at bat in all three 
areas -- TV, movies and publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like Newt Gingrich right now," said a jubilant Richard Baker, a 
partner in the talent management firm of Messina Baker Entertainment, the chief 
strategists behind Allen's career. "Wait . . . maybe that doesn't sound so 
good," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it sounds like, there's no denying that Baker and partner Rick 
Messina, who function as Allen's de facto agents, have in Allen that rare 
crossover performer. And guess what? His price tag just went up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the successful opening of this film, Tim will be in the highest 
echelon of film salaries," Baker predicted. Baker won't quantify it, but 
observers expect Allen to get between $8 million and $10 million for his second 
film -- maybe more -- putting him in a league with Robin Williams and Tom 
Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure that Baker and Messina are applying to Allen might be called the 
"Jim Carrey multiple." Shortly after Carrey's "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" 
premiered with a $12-million opening weekend box office, Carrey was able to 
command a $7-million fee for his next films. Until then, Carrey was best known 
as one of the ensemble cast from Fox's "In Living Color," a critically 
acclaimed but much lower-rated series than Allen's "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen has a much higher profile than Carrey. "Home Improvement" is watched by 
about 40 million people each week. In its fourth year on ABC, the series has 
turned out to be the second-highest-grossing prime-time network show in 
syndication, generating about $400 million for the rerun rights of the first 
125 episodes. Including advances from syndication proceeds, Allen is said to 
earn $200,000 an episode -- or $5 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's success is also a big bonanza for Disney, which has essentially turned 
him into a franchise. Besides producing "Home Improvement" and "The Santa 
Clause," the company's Hyperion books unit published Allen's "Never Stand Too 
Close to a Naked Man," which is now entering its seventh week on the coveted 
New York Times bestseller list. Allen and co-writer David Rensin hammered out 
the book earlier this spring during lunch breaks in Allen's trailer on the set 
of "Santa Clause" in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent management retreat, Disney Studios Chairman Joe Roth was already 
talking of more projects with Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 TV comedians have usually had a hard time on the big screen, with Robin 
Williams one big exception. Bill Cosby experienced an embarrassing flop with 
"Mystery Dad" at the height of "The Cosby Show," and Roseanne Arnold co-starred 
with Meryl Streep in the ill-fated "She-Devil" at her show's peak three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that failure in movies has financially crimped either Cosby or Roseanne. 
Cosby's gross take from the rerun proceeds of his show is estimated at nearly 
$300 million and Roseanne's could be about a third of that -- although Money 
magazine recently declared, after inspecting her divorce papers, that Roseanne 
and husband Tom Arnold were among the worst money managers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, however, good fortune brings its own set of problems. 
Allen -- who, unlike most other comedic actors has never had an agent -- lets 
his managers Baker and Messina field the offers and leaves the hard-tacks 
negotiating to his lawyer, Dennis Ardi of Shearman & Sterling, a Wall Street 
law firm known more for its work in corporate securities than gross points 
percentages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to get Tim an agent when we first started working with him," Baker 
recalled. "No one wanted him until he booked the TV series. Then we started 
getting major agency interest, which increased after the series debuted. . . . 
The fact that he's had this much success without a legit agent is an 
interesting phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, without an agent, Allen doesn't have to fork over 10% of his 
earnings to a third party. 
</P>
<P>
 Though more movies are likely for Allen, Baker thinks they will be limited to 
about one a year. That's because he is contracted to do three more years of 
"Home Improvement" after this season, which leaves little time for 
extracurricular activities -- no matter how lucrative the offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers credit Allen's success in "The Santa Clause" to Disney's 
marketing acumen. The studio found the right vehicle for the comedian. It then 
ran with the ball, plastering pictures of Allen in his Santa Claus get-up on 
countless billboards and bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baker rejects the notion that clever marketing alone has anything to do 
with Allen's success. He has heard people question the reasons for the 
comedian's success before, citing a trade magazine review of "Home Improvement" 
that described the pilot as a "one-note show, and not a very good note at 
that." But Baker says Allen has tremendous drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
 So, a TV show, a book, a movie -- what's next? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim wants his own theme park," cracked Baker. "Tim Al-land."

 Santa Fe Delays Burlington Northern Vote: Santa Fe Pacific Corp., saying it 
needs more time to study a hostile $3.3-billion takeover bid from Union Pacific 
Corp., postponed for two weeks a stockholders vote on a competing offer from 
Burlington Northern Inc. The meeting, originally scheduled for Friday, is now 
set for Dec. 2, but it remains open to holders of record Oct. 19. A Union 
Pacific spokesman applauded the delay, saying it "levels the playing field" and 
improves Union Pacific's ability to get a fair review by Santa Fe's board.

 Kmart Profit Plunges Almost 60%: Prompting renewed calls for the retailer to 
hire an outsider to help pump life into its sagging stores, Kmart Corp. said it 
earned $39 million, or 8 cents a share, compared to $94 million, or 20 cents a 
share, last year. The report was much weaker that Wall Street had expected. The 
retailer had warned shareholders earlier that earnings would be lower.

 Sybase Inc. said Monday that it will acquire Powersoft Corp. for about $940 
million to form the world's largest provider of client-server software, an 
increasingly popular tool used to link company branch networks to a central 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Powersoft, which has a 40% share of the world's client-server 
market, soared $7.875 to $69.25 on the Nasdaq. Sybase fell $2.06 to $46.31, 
also on Nasdaq, where both stocks were among the most active issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Sybase will offer 1.6 shares for each Powersoft share in 
a tax-free pooling of interests. Powersoft will become an independent 
subsidiary of Sybase. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger is subject to approval by the stockholders of each company and 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "This merger will create the worldwide leader in client-server software," Mark 
Hoffman, Sybase chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement. 
"The combination . . . strengthens our expertise, distribution, and product 
solutions to scale from the desktop to the enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The combined company will be the world's seventh-largest software provider, 
with annual revenue of $730 million, more than $236 million in cash and about 
$365 million in equity. Its combined annual growth rate of 75% makes it the 
fastest-growing among the world's Top 10 software companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybase, based in Emeryville, Calif., is one of the fastest-growing suppliers 
of client-server-based software and services. It had sales of $427 million last 
year, up 61% from 1992. Its revenue for the year through the third quarter was 
$617 million, up 67% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Powersoft, based in Concord, Mass., had 1993 sales of $57 million, up 118% 
from a year ago. Its latest annual revenue rose 146% to $113 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined company will have more than 2,000 independent software vendor and 
application partners. Sybase distributes software mainly through its 
direct-sales organization, while Powersoft's focus has been on resellers, 
complemented by a direct-sales force. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybase and Powersoft, which have cooperated for the past four years to provide 
software, said they will continue their commitment to open systems. Powersoft 
will remain an open database tools provider, while Sybase will continue to work 
with client-server tools of other companies as well as its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Powersoft estimates that half its customers use Powersoft tools with SYBASE 
SQL Server databases. Sybase estimates that 30% of its SQL Server customers 
develop applications with Powersoft tools.

DELAYS SOUGHT IN QUAKE POLICY RATE HIKES; INSURANCE: CONSUMER GROUPS WANT 
HEARINGS HELD ON REQUESTS. TWO LEADING FIRMS WANT PREMIUMS TO BE DOUBLED.

 Arguing that earthquake insurance rate increases are being approved without 
adequate scrutiny, a consumer group Monday requested hearings on more than 20 
applications for rate hikes, which could delay approvals for months -- well 
into the term of Insurance Commissioner-elect Charles W. Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 The Proposition 103 Enforcement Project, headed by Harvey Rosenfield, author 
of the 1988 rate-cutting initiative, said it will intervene in filings by State 
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., Allstate Insurance Co., Republic 
Insurance Co. and Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project is stepping in as the watchdog (that) consumers need to stop the 
industry from stampeding the (Insurance) Department into granting outrageous 
and arbitrary earthquake insurance rate increases," Gina Calabrese, a lawyer 
for the organization, said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is not required to hold hearings on any rate increases, but 
under Proposition 103, consumer groups that request intervenor status are 
automatically granted hearings on rate increases of more than 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm and Allstate, California's No. 1 and 2 homeowners and earthquake 
insurers, are seeking to double their earthquake rates to about $3 per $1,000 
worth of coverage on policies with a 10% deductible. Other companies have filed 
for increases ranging up to 174%. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi recently approved without hearings rate 
increases of 37% for Safeco Insurance Co. of America and 122% for Prudential 
Property & Casualty, as well as increases for three smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabrese said in an interview Monday that there hasn't been adequate 
justification for the increases granted and that the hearings are needed to 
demonstrate how the companies arrived at the rates they are seeking.

FTC EXAMINES ANOTHER PROPOSED MAJOR MERGER IN DRUG INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after restricting a major drug industry merger, the Federal Trade 
Commission is examining another -- SmithKline Beecham's purchase of Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 London-based SmithKline Beecham said Monday that it was not surprised by the 
FTC's notice, but it added that it worked closely with the agency before 
finalizing its $2.3-billion deal last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversified, of Bloomington, Minn., manages prescription drug benefits for 11 
million people in the United States.SmithKline Beecham, the world's 
third-largest pharmaceutical company, has U.S. headquarters in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, after Eli Lilly Co. agreed to restrictions on its 
$4-billion purchase of PCS Health Systems Inc., a prescription management 
business, the FTC said it was concerned about the "overall competitive impact" 
of such mergers. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug benefits managers control the drugs that members of its managed health 
care programs can use. 
</P>
<P>
 Mergers between drug companies and drug benefit managers have raised concerns 
that the manufacturers would gain unfair advantages over competitors.

 French Drug Company Announces Biotech Consortium: Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. 
said 14 companies and research groups will explore gene and cell therapy 
treatments for cancer, heart and circulatory diseases, AIDS, Alzheimer's and 
other afflictions. Rhone plans to spend $100 million in each of the next two 
years, or about 15% of its total research and development budget, on the 
project, which involves small biotechnology companies, U.S. and French research 
centers and companies already affiliated with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Though 
biotechnology affiliations are common, this is believed to be the largest.

 Provident to Remain in Pasadena: Provident Investment Counsel, a $14.5-billion 
money management firm, said it foresees no changes in its 107-person staff or 
operations despite the sale of the business to United Asset Management of 
Boston.Provident, a 43-year-old institutional investor, said its five senior 
partners decided to sell their stakes to UAM partly for estate tax reasons. 
Provident's chairman, Robert Kommerstad, is 67. The firm is one of the nation's 
biggest growth-stock investors. UAM, which will have assets of about $120 
billion after the purchase, has largely grown through acquisitions of private 
institutional investors.

 Bentsen Urges Caution on Rates: Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned the 
Federal Reserve Board against overdoing its anti-inflation campaign.Speaking 
one day before the central bank was to meet to map monetary strategy, Bentsen 
said inflation remains low and the economy has yet to feel the full impact of 
the Fed's repeated rate increases this year. He said growth needs to slow 
moderately to prevent the economy from overheating, but "that's the problem: 
being sure you just slow it moderately." The Fed is widely expected to bump up 
rates again by at least half a percentage point at its policy-setting meeting 
today.

DELTA IN LINE TO BE FIRST TO BAN SMOKING ON ALL OF ITS FLIGHTS

 Delta Air Lines is banning smoking on its flights across the Pacific, making 
it the first U.S carrier to forbid smoking on all flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based Delta, the nation's third-largest carrier, said Monday that it 
will extend its ban on smoking to its transpacific flights effective Jan. 1.The 
airline had earlier announced it would ban smoking on all flights across the 
Atlantic, also effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Other U.S. airlines have also banned smoking on some flights, but so far none 
had instituted a ban on all of them. Smoking is banned on all domestic 
commercial flights within the United States, and Congress is considering 
legislation to ban smoking on any flight that begins or ends in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action further strengthens our company's longstanding commitment to 
provide our customers with superior customer service," said Robert W. Coggin, 
Delta's senior vice president of marketing.

SUITOR FOR CHIRON MAY BE CIBA-GEIGY; PHARMACEUTICALS: SHARES HAVE TRADED 
STRONGLY AFTER REPORTS OF TAKEOVER ATTEMPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shares of Chiron Corp. were up again Monday on reports that Switzerland's 
Ciba-Geigy is in negotiations with the Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology 
company to buy a significant minority stake for nearly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiron, which manufactures drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis, cancer and 
other illnesses, had disclosed Friday that it was in talks with an unidentified 
company interested in buying a substantial stake in the firm. Chiron officials 
have so far failed to disclose the identity of the buyer, but news reports and 
analysts say the company is Ciba-Geigy, a big pharmaceutical and chemical firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiron shares closed up $2.75 at $74.25 in heavy trading on Nasdaq, adding to 
Friday's huge gains, when the shares jumped $11.75 a share, or 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts speculated Monday that the talks with Ciba may be stuck over 
price and how much control the Swiss firm would exercise. Officials of Chiron 
and Ciba declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported that the companies 
had discussed a deal in which Ciba would acquire 33% of Chiron's shares held by 
the public for $100 each. The newspaper said Ciba would buy another 16% stake 
-- raising its total holdings to 49% -- by turning over its diagnostic business 
to Chiron and giving up its 50% stake in Biocine Co. Formed in 1987, Biocine is 
a 50-50 joint venture of Chiron and Ciba to develop treatments for genital 
herpes and for the HIV virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said Chiron's shares may be worth considerably more than $100 a 
share and speculated that disclosure of the talks with Ciba might attract 
additional suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that Chiron management feels it needs to do something," said Jim 
McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter. Two other likely 
suitors, he said, are Johnson & Johnson, a partner of Chiron in a 
blood-screening business called Ortho Diagnostic Systems, and Germany's 
Schering, whose Berlex Laboratories markets Chiron's multiple sclerosis drug, 
Betaseron. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts consider Chiron to have perhaps the most diversified lineup of new 
drug treatments in the biotechnology industry -- a business in which most 
companies are heavily reliant on one or two products. 
</P>
<P>
 That diversity makes Chiron attractive to a host of big European and U.S. 
pharmaceutical companies, many of which are suffering from a shortage of 
promising new products. 
</P>
<P>
 For Chiron, such a deal would give it access to capital, which is important in 
an industry where a new bioengineered drug typically costs $100 million to $150 
million to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 McCamant estimates that Chiron's various business lines, if sold separately, 
would be valued at about $175 a share. Chiron's shares have traded as high as 
$96 during the last 52 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chiron has the No. 1 scientific effort and the best product pipeline in the 
industry, better than Genentech and light-years ahead of Amgen," McCamant said, 
referring to two other California biotech leaders.

MCA AIMS TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF BARNEY; VIDEO: NEW CHILDREN'S SERIES WILL 
FEATURE A TINY BUT TENACIOUS RIVAL TO THE PURPLE DINOSAUR.

<P>
 MCA's home video division is planning to give Barney a toothache. The company 
on Monday announced a series featuring Timmy the Tooth, an original character 
the entertainment giant hopes will topple the purple dinosaur as king of the 
$300-million children's video market. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Feola, president of MCA Home Video, said the series will be the first 
launched by a major studio to star a character created for video. Many 
best-selling children's videos feature familiar characters from books or 
television shows such as "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" or "Barney." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and kids will be introduced to Timmy in January, when the videos will 
air on television for two weeks before they are to go on sale in supermarkets, 
video and discount stores. The marketing blitz also includes giveaways to 
day-care centers and a promotional tie-in with Kellogg Co. The videos contain a 
commercial for Rice Krispies, Kellogg's first advertisement on video. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggested retail price for the videos is $12.98. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives said MCA has a tough task ahead promoting Timmy without 
continuous help from a TV series, but Feola said he believes the video will 
gain momentum over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither MCA nor Kellogg would say how much they are spending on Timmy 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Feola said the series contains no personal hygiene message, even though 
Timmy's best friend is a toothbrush and his enemy is a cavity. His friends also 
include an octopus and a goldfish, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two books featuring Timmy are being published by Price-Stern-Sloan, and MCA is 
talking with two other consumer products companies about tie-ins, Feola said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Move over, Barney!" Feola said, making clear his intent to unseat Barney. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, Barney is still welcome at Universal Studios in Florida, where MCA 
is planning a Barney exhibit.

NOTEBOOK; OCEAN VIEW FINISHES ON TOP OF THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You probably have never heard of Nathan Traxler, but he is an offensive and 
defensive lineman for Ocean View. He was one of those players who, until the 
Seahawks broke their 36-game losing streak three weeks ago, had only a 
scoreless tie against Huntington Beach his freshman year to consider as a 
highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county's best teams prepare for the playoffs, Ocean View is done, 
the victim of a 2-8 season, happy to finish on top. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the world, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View finished with a flourish, upsetting second-place Westminster (6-4) 
on a scoring pass from Ted Norman to Terry Schneider -- and Jon Dempsey's extra 
point -- with three seconds left to win, 7-6. That gave the Seahawks victories 
in two of their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a positive way to end the season; it gives you something to build 
on all year long," second-year Coach John Donnelly said. "It shows the kids the 
correlation between perseverance and reward. They've worked so hard through all 
the stories about the losing streak, all the chides they had to hear from 
fellow students and in the community, to go out a winner like this is really 
positive. They finally got to achieve the reward that we kept telling them all 
year was coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The effects were immediate. Two players approached Donnelly Monday asking how 
they could come out for the football team, though it might be hard to start for 
next year's Seahawks -- they have nine starters back on offense, seven on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a whole different feeling around the school, a feeling of hope, and 
they can be a part of it," Donnelly said. "It's hard to recruit on campus when 
kids think you're just going to lose anyway. All the kids last year that went 
0-10, they helped start the program. Even though they were 0-10, they made vast 
improvements over the 0-10 season from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rome wasn't built in a day. Building a program is systematic, and with the 
excitement, it will really help the off-season program." 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe the greatest tribute to Ocean View's program comes from Traxler who, 
like Calvin Silva and Brett McMahon, spent the last three years on the varsity, 
trudging through infamy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked hard last year, and the year before, and this year. We worked until 
dark and beyond," Traxler said. "The main thing I learned out of my high school 
career was whether we won or not, I knew I had something that would stay with 
me the rest of my life. . . . Even if I don't win and achieve my goal, I still 
gave 100% and did my best -- and that's what counts." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The only thing that stood between Ocean View winning its final three games was 
a 13-0 loss to Tustin (1-8). The Tillers had the game in hand with 1 1/2 
minutes left, but needed to convert on third and three from the 10. The play in 
the huddle was a dive, but quarterback Kevin Timone recognized the Ocean View 
defense and called an audible -- a pass -- which he completed to Greg Carnal at 
the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Coach Tim Ellis immediately called time out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an audible to a certain defense, and Kevin, not thinking where we were 
in the game, called an audible," Ellis said. "So I called time out and told him 
to sit on the ball because there was no sense in running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our noses rubbed in it a couple of times. Having been on the other 
end, I was real conscious of that, and I apologized immediately. I think it 
sets a bad example. We had the game in hand; scoring there doesn't prove 
anything and doesn't show any class. You have to remember that at some point in 
time, the shoe will be on the other foot." 
</P>

 Two weeks ago, Villa Park lineman Matt Welch was on an operating table 
undergoing heart surgery. Saturday, he played for the Spartans in a 27-8 
victory over Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch, who played tight end and on the defensive line, also will be ready for 
the Spartans' first-round playoff game Friday against Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy he's back," Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. "He was our second 
tight end in our two tight-end set and he played half the game on defense." 
</P>
<P>
 One day after playing in a 14-0 victory over Orange, Welch was taken to the 
hospital and was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition. On Nov. 2, he 
underwent a relatively new procedure.  
</P>
<P>
 An electrical probe, inside catheters, was inserted into several major 
arteries and veins to repair the condition, and one day later he was cheering 
his teammates on to a 14-10 victory over Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing as well as he was earlier in the season," Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Canyon receiver Greg Jacobs caught eight passes against El Dorado in his first 
game of the season, then went on the record: "I want to get in the 70 range." 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the regular season with 61 in nine games. He gets another shot at 
El Dorado on Friday. 
</P>

 Included in the Pacifica football program are short biographies of the 
Mariners' returning lettermen, with their nicknames. The offensive line has 
some monikers that make you wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Anderson goes by "Mack," Alex Murray answers to "Sloth," and Mike 
Ormsby has the rare distinction of being "Bunny." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Bunny" might not bring to mind an offensive lineman, something in 
Murray's biography does. His favorite food? 
</P>
<P>
 "International buffet."

 Jerry Halpin, Los Alamitos activities director, is a creature of habit. He has 
worn the same shirt and jeans to every Griffin football game since the team's 
45-game unbeaten streak began. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basketball coaches want me to wear them at their games," Halpin said, 
"but this is only for football." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone enjoys his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lost, the only good thing about it would be no one would see this 
outfit again," Halpin said. "Or at least that's what people tell me." 
</P>

 Garden Grove played seven of its nine games in its campus stadium, including a 
"road" game against Los Amigos. The only traveling the Argonauts did consisted 
of two trips to Bolsa Grande High for games against Bolsa Grande and Pacifica. 
Total round trip? About 10 miles.

 In only his sophomore year, Capistrano Valley's Malaefou MacKenzie (905 yards 
rushing, 14 touchdowns) has distinguished himself as one of the county's best 
runners. Admittedly, MacKenzie now needs to mature some. 
</P>
<P>
 After his one-yard touchdown run in the first quarter of Capistrano Valley's 
21-14 South Coast League loss to Trabuco Hills on Thursday, MacKenzie broke 
into an especially animated celebration, complete with hands and arms waving. 
One problem: MacKenzie's personal party occurred smack in front of an official, 
who wasn't amused. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie was called for unsportsmanlike conduct, turning the point-after 
attempt into a 35-yard try. The kick failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was taunting," said MacKenzie, who rushed for a game-high 
100 yards and scored two touchdowns. "I was just celebrating."

<P>
 Defending champion: Rialto Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 Top teams: La Puente Bishop Amat (10-0), Mater Dei (10-0), Los Alamitos 
(10-0), Long Beach Jordan (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Esperanza (7-3). The Aztecs lost to Mater Dei by 10, Long Beach 
Poly by three and Los Alamitos buy three. They easily could have won all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Lammont Anderson, Redlands, RB; Steve Bodnar, Mater Dei, RB; 
Ralph Brown, Bishop Amat, DB; Brian Carter, Trabuco Hills, WR/DB; Zane 
Champion, Trabuco Hills, OL; Matt Dempsey, Lakewood, LB; Arild Faraimmo, Long 
Beach Poly, RB; Kevin Feterik, Los Alamitos, QB; Todd Fielding, Mission Viejo, 
RB/DB; John Flynn, Mater Dei, QB; Dahrin Footman, Esperanza, RB; LeJuan 
Gibbons, Long Beach Jordan, RB; Art Gipson, Fontana, RB; Tony Hartley, Los 
Alamitos, WR; Anton Hector, Esperanza, DB; Dax Houston, Los Alamitos, DL; Ahmad 
Jackson, Long Beach Jordan, RB; Ortege Jenkins, Long Beach Jordan, QB; Todd 
Keneley, Mission Viejo, DL; Bryan Lachappelle, Edison, DB; Andy Linnen, Edison, 
WR; Dave Lins, Encino Crespi, QB; Brad Lisotto, Edison, RB; Pat Markovsky, 
Edison, QB; Daylon McCutcheon, Bishop Amat, RB; Brad Melsby, Los Alamitos, 
WR/DB; Kory Miner, Bishop Amat, DE; Austin Moherman, Mission Viejo, QB; Matt 
Motherway, Mater Dei, OL/DL; Matt Nelson, Redlands, RB; Ace Paule, Bishop Amat, 
DE; Josh Perkins, Lakewood, RB; Rod Perry, Mater Dei, WR; J.C. Pinstak, Trabuco 
Hills, QB; Brent Santoro, Esperanza, OL/DL; Chris Stretch, Esperanza, QB; Jerry 
Sprewell, Long Beach Poly, LB; Taeao Saluasa, Long Beach Poly, LB; Ryan 
Williams, Bellflower St. John Bosco, RB. 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Mater Dei. A clear field to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Bishop Amat. The top-seeded team is looking at facing a rather 
nasty Edison team in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: In case anyone out there doesn't know, Los Alamitos has a 45-game 
unbeaten streak. One more victory ties the Southern Section record held by 
Temple City (1969-73) and Canyon Country Canyon (1983-86) . . . The Griffins 
have won three consecutive section titles. No Orange County team has won four 
consecutive . . . Los Alamitos can complete a sweep of divisions. The Griffins 
began their title run in Division III in 1991, then won the Division II 
championship the last two seasons . . . Esperanza tied Los Alamitos, 14-14, in 
the 1992 Division title game . . . Mater Dei could play Eisenhower in the 
second round. The Monarchs were throttled, 56-3, by Eisenhower last season . . 
. McCutcheon, who has gained more than 1,741 yards and scored 25 touchdowns, is 
the son of former Ram Lawrence McCutcheon. Perry, an ever-dangerous receiver, 
is the son of former Ram Rod Perry. Their fathers were teammates in the late 
1970s . . . Bishop Amat opens against Mission Viejo, just as it did in 1992, 
when the Lancers won the title.

DIVISION X AT A GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defending champion: Los Angeles Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
 Top teams: Mary Star (9-1); Serrano (8-1-1); Orange Lutheran (8-2); Valley 
Christian (8-2); Kilpatrick (8-2); Rosamond (8-2); Ontario Christian (8-2); Big 
Bear (7-2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Montclair Prep (7-1) and Los Angeles Baptist (3-7). Montclair Prep 
does not play in a league, and might be a mystery to the lower bracket teams it 
faces. Baptist spent the season adjusting to 22 players lost to graduation and 
several key injuries. The team is healthy now and could be peaking at the right 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Russ Anderson, Serrano, QB. Che Holloway, Orange Lutheran, RB. 
Michael Carmona, Serrano, RB. Jon Deverian, Los Angeles Baptist, R. Tim 
Drombosky, Silver Valley, RB. Raul Espitia, Serrano, RB. Tony Franklin, Silver 
Valley, R. Joe Juliano, Orange Lutheran, QB. Harlan Miersma, Ontario Christian, 
QB. Mario Qualls, Kilpatrick, RB. Robbie Wood, Paraclete, QB. 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Big Bear. There is only one other top-seeded league champion 
(Rosamond) in the lower bracket. It's remarkably similar to the draw Big Bear 
had en route to winning the 1992 Division X title. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Orange Lutheran. The road to the title has several land mines from 
Mary Star to Serrano to Ontario. And their opener is against defending champion 
L.A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Orange Lutheran won a share of the Olympic League title by beating 
co-champion Valley Christian. It was Lutheran's first Olympic championship. . . 
. All three of Baptist's victories were in league. They are the only team in 
the playoffs with an under-.500 record. . . . There has not been a repeat 
champion since Division X was formed in 1990. . . . Only three teams -- Big 
Bear, Rosamond and Village Christian -- had unbeaten, untied league seasons. . 
. . Eight was the magic number. Six teams won that total of games. Four won 
seven; Mary Star was the lone team to win as many as nine games.

DIVISION VII AT A GLANCE

<P>
 Defending champion: Manhattan Beach Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 Top teams: Culver City (9-1), Mira Costa (9-1), Lompoc (9-1), Arroyo Grande 
(8-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Rancho Alamitos (7-2-1). The Vaqueros, who haven't lost since the 
third week of the season, are playing as well as anyone in the division. 
Notoriously slow starters, Rancho Alamitos lost two of its first three games 
last year, then went all the way to the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Kevin Allen, Rancho Alamitos, RB; John Dear, Garden Grove, L; 
Antwan Duncan, South Hills, RB; Greg Fausto, Los Amigos, RB; Mike Fikes, Mira 
Costa, RB; John Frank, Rancho Alamitos, QB; Greg Garand, Sunny Hills, QB; Eric 
Hernandez, Sunny Hills, WR; Tim Jones, Sunny Hills, FB; Aaron Kogan, Beverly 
Hills, RB; Shaun Malcom, Covina, RB; Manuel Millan, Garden Grove, RB; Robert 
Oliver, Sunny Hills, RB; Brett Pierce, South Hills, QB; Jeff Renaud, Sunny 
Hills, R; Mark Reza, South Hills, WR/S; Jasiri Rodell, Culver City, R; Niu 
Satele, Los Amigos, TE/DL; Peter Souza, Lompoc, RB; Ape Tuato, Los Amigos, 
QB/S; Nick Terrones, Lompoc, QB; Jeff Turbarg, Rancho Alamitos, R/DB; Michael 
Ulrich, Covina, QB; Chris Velotta, Sunny Hills, RB; Chris Wallace, Beverly 
Hills, QB; John Wilkie, Fullerton, RB; Damon Williams, Culver City, QB; Aki 
Wilson, Culver City, RB; Ed Wynn, Lompoc, RB; Chris Young, Fullerton, RB; Chris 
Young, Rancho Alamitos, RB/LB. 
</P>
<P>
 Best draws: Mira Costa, and Sunny Hills. Mira Costa is the defending champion 
and has a wealth of talent, but it's hard to believe two teams from the same 
league (Ocean) were seeded Nos. 1 and 2 in the division. Sunny Hills (4-6) had 
a losing season, yet received a better draw than Los Amigos (9-1) or Rancho 
Alamitos (7-2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Rancho Alamitos (7-2-1). For winning the Garden Grove League, the 
Vaqueros get to play top-seeded Culver City in the second round. "I'm glad to 
be in the playoffs, but I don't understand where I land playing Culver City in 
the second round," Rancho Alamitos Coach Doug Case said. "I think we probably 
should have been seeded fourth, but then I don't think we got much respect for 
beating Los Amigos." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: A fourth of the teams in the draw have losing records, Garden Grove 
(4-5), Sunny Hills (4-6), Buena Park (4-6) and Santa Maria (1-9). Yes, that's 
not a misprint: Santa Maria made the playoffs with a 1-9 record. The Saints 
tied for third place in the Northern League and were picked to represent the 
league because they had a longer playoff drought than the other two teams.. . . 
. The top four seeded teams were from two leagues, the Northern and the Ocean. 
Meanwhile, the Freeway and the Garden Grove were left out of the seeding 
process. . . . Said Los Amigos Coach Roger Takahashi of the draw: "I look at it 
philosophically. We're 9-1. If we play to our level, we'll win the ball games. 
If you beat the team that is seeded, you're taking their road. I feel more 
badly for Doug (Case). His team is better than that. They shouldn't be playing 
the No. 1 seed in the second round.". . . South Hills' Pierce (1,336 yards, 14 
touchdowns), re-injured his hamstring last week in a loss to Covina, but he is 
expected to start against Los Amigos. . . . Mira Costa's Fikes has rushed for 
more than 100 yards in every game this season and has scored 19 touchdowns. 
Sophomore Kevin Cooper started the last three games at quarterback in place of 
senior Kevin Fujimoto.

DIVISION V AT A GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defending champion: Norco. Two-time defending division champion, now in 
Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
 Top teams: Newport Harbor (10-0), Savanna (8-2), Servite (8-2), Foothill 
(6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Valencia (4-5-1). Under Coach Mike Marrujo, the Tigers have won 
section titles in 1987, '91 and '92. This season, they closed the season with 
three consecutive victories to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Ismail Abdullah, El Dorado, RB; David Bedard, Servite, RB; Dean 
Chambers, Western, QB; Glen Giesen, Sunny Hills, OL; John Giordani, Newport 
Harbor, QB; Jamie Hanaway, El Toro, RB; Brian Hogan, Corona del Mar, RB; Adam 
Hoover, Canyon, QB; Leonard Ibarra, Westminster, RB; Greg Jacobs, Canyon, WR; 
Bill Johns, Newport Harbor, DL; Daven King, Savanna, RB; Jeremy Klemp, Savanna, 
QB; Tyler Lang, Foothill, QB; Charlie Marino, Kennedy, RB; Darin Martineau, 
Kennedy, LB; Sean McMahon, Villa Park, QB; Jerome Owens, Brea-Olinda, RB; Jeff 
Renaud, Sunny Hills, WR; Joe Secoda, Valencia, QB/DB; Rhett Shepard, Valencia, 
DB; Ruben Vaughan, Foothill, DE; Danny Verino, Saddleback, RB; Stan Villenueva, 
Century, QB; Brian Wilson, El Toro, QB. 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Savanna (8-2). The Rebels, who won the Division VI title last 
season, won't have to play a league champion until the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Century (6-4). The Centurions shared the Empire League title with 
El Dorado but face Brea-Olinda in the first round with top-seeded Newport 
Harbor looming in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Friday, Brea-Olinda missed an Orange League title by inches, so now it 
has to play a league champion in the first round. Trailing, 10-7, with less 
than three minutes remaining, Brea-Olinda (7-2-1) was driving and faced a 
fourth and three but was stopped inches short of a first down near the Valencia 
40. If the Wildcats had kicked a tying field goal, it would have shared the 
league title with Savanna . . . Newport Harbor will try to equal the school 
record for victories in a season. In 1992, under Coach Jeff Brinkley, the 
Sailors finished 11-3 but lost in the Division IV championship game to Irvine . 
. . Foothill and Coach Tom Meiss are 0-6 against Sea View League teams in the 
last two seasons, but the fourth-seeded Knights won't meet a Sea View opponent 
unless they reach the semifinals. Foothill plays Kennedy (7-3) in the first 
round, and the Fighting Irish were ranked as high as second in Division V this 
season but have lost their last two games . . . Villa Park (9-1) will be a 
stronger title contender if running back Franklin Haynes returns. Haynes, a 
sophomore who led the team in rushing, was suspended indefinitely two weeks 
ago, but Spartan Coach Pat Mahoney said the school will announce this week if 
Haynes will be eligible to play Friday against Corona del Mar (5-5) . . . 
Corona del Mar features one of the county's top running backs, Hogan, who has 
rushed for 1,391 yards. Owens of Brea-Olinda (1,077) is the division's only 
other 1,000-yard rusher. Servite running back Bedard has scored 23 touchdowns, 
fourth best in the county . . . Four of the division's quarterbacks are rated 
in the top 10 in the county: Savanna's Klemp, Western's Chambers, Villa Park's 
McMahon, and Servite's Martin.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PERFECTDATA REPORTS TURNAROUND IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PerfectData Corp., the Simi Valley maker of computer maintenance products, 
reported a turnaround for the fiscal second quarter that ended Sept. 30. 
Earnings for the quarter were $182,000, compared with a loss of $102,000 the 
previous year.Sales for the quarter were $2.19 million, up 25% from $1.74 
million the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, earnings were $297,000, compared with a loss of $156,000 a 
year earlier. Sales for the six months were $3.96 million, up from $3.33 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the change to its decision in May to get out of the 
business of selling computer modems and cables, and focus exclusively on 
cleaning and maintenance products for offices. The company has also hired 
additional sales representatives.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FIDELITY BANK'S LOSSES NARROW IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fidelity Federal Bank reported a narrowed loss and improved asset quality in 
the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, but the Glendale-based savings and 
loan's losses through the first three quarters are nearly quadruple those of a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity posted a loss of $8.23 million in the third quarter, compared to a 
year-earlier loss of $14.4 million.For the January through September period, 
Fidelity reported losses of $114 million, compared to $28.9 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity has been hobbled by bad loans as a result of the recession and the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, but asset quality improved in the third quarter. 
Non-performing assets totaled $75 million on Sept. 30, down from $274 million 
three months earlier. In turn, the amount the S & L set aside for expected loan 
losses was $3 million in the third quarter, compared to $19.5 million in the 
same quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But unloading problem loans has shrunk Fidelity's asset portfolio to $3.7 
billion at the end of the third quarter, down 17% from a year earlier. And the 
S & L said that despite improved asset quality, future write-downs and loan 
loss provisions may still be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continuing increases in interest rates could erode consumer confidence and 
put pressure on the ability of our multifamily borrowers to make their loan 
payments," said Richard M. Greenwood, chief executive of Fidelity.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: INFOMERCIAL PRODUCER DOUBLES ITS EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Positive Response Television Inc., a fast-growing infomercial producer, 
doubled its earnings in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks company said its net income was $916,000 in the three months 
ended Sept. 30, up from a $442,000 profit a year earlier. Its quarterly revenue 
surged to $10.6 million from $1.52 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the recent nine-month period, Positive Response earned $1.25 million, an 
89% gain from a $661,000 profit a year before. Revenue grew to $17.1 million 
from $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed its quick growth to the money it raised in its initial 
public stock offering in May, the success of its infomercials and its expanding 
business distributing infomercials developed by others.

PINKERTON LENDS EAR FOR WORKER COMPLAINTS; ETHICS: THE ENCINO-BASED SECURITY 
GIANT OPERATES ALERTLINE TO HEAR EMPLOYEES' ANONYMOUS REPORTS OF CRIME, SAFETY 
VIOLATIONS OR HARASSMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, tough new federal sentencing guidelines took effect that 
drastically increased fines for companies found guilty of crimes such as fraud. 
But the guidelines also created a powerful incentive for corporations to adopt 
ethics programs by reducing fines for companies shown to have procedures in 
place to detect criminal behavior and reporting offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was a business opportunity for Pinkerton Security & Investigation 
Service, the Encino-based security services giant. In the past two years, 
business has tripled for Pinkerton's AlertLine, which provides a toll-free 
phone service for employees to report anonymously on any unacceptable behavior 
or conditions in their workplace, including sexual harassment, theft or safety 
hazards, according to T. Richard Elslager, Pinkerton divisional vice president 
of AlertLine Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of companies ranging from manufacturing to entertainment to finance 
-- and from 25 to more than 200,000 employees -- pay Pinkerton for its 
AlertLine services. Fees are based on the size of the company and how the 
program is customized for that business. 
</P>
<P>
 For their money, corporations get literature and other educational materials 
to teach employees about company ethics programs and ways to help keep the 
workplace safe and free of wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
 The second major service is the 800 number that promises workers strict 
confidentiality in reporting their complaints or observations. At the 
division's offices in Charlotte, N.C., Pinkerton operators man phones 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week, taking information from callers and filing detailed 
reports to the client companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkerton, with $772 million in annual revenue, is best known for its 
guards-for-hire and other securities services. It doesn't break out financial 
results for AlertLine. But with incentives continually increasing for companies 
to identify and deal with internal problems, Elslager said, "I don't see 
interest in this type of service declining." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of Pinkerton's AlertLine coincides with a recent boom in corporate 
ethics programs. A decade ago, Gary Edwards, president of the nonprofit Ethics 
Resource Center in Washington, was unaware of any corporation that had an 
ethics office or ombudsman. But the center found in a study it conducted this 
year that one-third of the more than 4,000 companies surveyed now have such an 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of those ethics offices have some sort of "safe reporting 
system," including phone hot lines or help lines, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate ethics programs were born in the mid-1980s when large defense 
contractors found themselves in hot water with the government for a variety of 
abuses. Defense giant General Dynamics Corp., for instance, was among the first 
to set up an in-house department to encourage ethical behavior. The trend 
spread to other industries and received a big boost with the 1991 
implementation of the new sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 While Edwards also sees continued growth for help lines -- sometimes 
derisively referred to as snitch lines or rat lines -- he also believes that 
they can have limited value when provided by a third party like Pinkerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing is good," Edwards said of Pinkerton. But AlertLine "is not 
sufficient by itself because it is not going to provide help on the question of 
misconduct. You need the internal resources that understand the company, its 
products and its policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Nynex Corp., a big telephone company with an award-winning ethics program, 
finds that 85% of the calls to its GuideLine 800 number involve employees 
asking for advice on issues ranging from potential conflicts of interest to 
personality conflicts, said Ann Whelehan, who heads Nynex's New York ethics 
office. In an era when the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly and 
lines are being blurred among competitors, customers and vendors, Nynex 
employees need constant guidance on proper conduct, Whelehan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkerton's AlertLine phone reporting service, by contrast, dispenses no 
advice to callers. It only reports the employee's concerns to the employer, who 
is then responsible for any response. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hoffman, executive director of the Center for Business Ethics at 
Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., said that many corporate ethics officers are 
strongly opposed to third-party hot lines because they believe it defeats their 
goal of establishing trust between the company and its employees. Nonetheless, 
Hoffman thinks outside reporting services can be valuable to companies that 
lack resources to maintain a complete in-house ethics program.  
</P>
<P>
 Elslager acknowledged that the Pinkerton AlertLine is "one small component of 
a corporation's overall compliance program." But he sees AlertLine's 
third-party status as an advantage. Because it is a neutral, professionally run 
operation outside the company, he said, employees can have greater confidence 
that confidentiality will be maintained, and that confidence encourages 
employees to report problems. Also, he said, AlertLine is an around-the-clock 
operation, unlike many in-house corporate hot lines that turn on an answering 
machine after business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Elslager said, Pinkerton customizes its educational programs for 
companies. For a retailer, for example, it might provide literature on how to 
reduce inventory reductions due to theft or paperwork errors. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the calls to the Pinkerton AlertLine fall in the category of job 
complaints, Elslager said. Those include people unhappy with what they believe 
are unfair job reviews or conflicts with their bosses. The next biggest 
category is policy violations and theft, followed by substance abuse and 
harassment claims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pinkerton employees ask detailed questions, then prepare reports that are 
promptly dispatched to the company. The caller is asked to call back on a 
specific date to let Pinkerton know if the matter was resolved; again, the 
information is passed on to the employer. Pinkerton also encourages workers to 
agree to conference calls with an AlertLine specialist and someone from the 
company who can address the issue.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: DICK CLARK REPORTS DROP IN 1ST QUARTER REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Clark Productions Inc., a Burbank-based television production company, 
reported a steep slide in earnings in its fiscal first quarter that ended Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company posted a $19,000 profit in the quarter, compared to year-earlier 
earnings of $431,000. Revenues fell 38% to $8.45 million, compared to revenues 
of $13.7 million in the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the decline in revenue was due to a decrease in television 
production activity, and a decrease in the number of projects handled by the 
company's corporate events subsidiary. These losses were partially offset, the 
company said, by an increase in revenues and profits from the company's "Dick 
Clark's American Bandstand Grill" restaurant chain.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: A SURGE IN RETAILING FOR THE COUNTY, FORECASTER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County isn't about to return to the boom days of the late 1980s, but 
the county's business climate should continue "stabilizing" over the next six 
months, predicts Mark Schniepp, director of the UC Santa Barbara Economic 
Forecast Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp, who tracks Ventura County closely, looks for a surge in retailing 
and some other non-manufacturing fields in the months ahead, but believes that 
high-tech and industrial activity will remain stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's economy is a mixed bag," he said. "The eastern part is doing 
better than the west. On the whole, there's growth, but it's negligible." Most 
job openings are of the low-paying variety, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent report by the state Employment Development 
Department, the county's jobless rate in September was 8.9%, up slightly from 
the previous month, but down nearly a full percentage point from a year 
earlier. Higher-paying jobs in technology and industrial plants are still hard 
to come by, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, we can say Ventura County climbed out of the recession 
somewhere around the end of this year's first quarter and the start of the 
second quarter," Schniepp said. "It's important to remember, though, that the 
end of a recession doesn't necessarily mean a huge number of jobs are being 
created." 
</P>
<P>
 While the employment picture should improve steadily, if unspectacularly, 
retailers' prospects are brightening, the economist noted. "There's a pent-up 
demand in the county for such items as furniture and cars. The auto malls in 
Oxnard and Thousand Oaks have been doing extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp expects retailing to be especially strong in Thousand Oaks, Oxnard, 
Simi Valley and Moorpark. "I'm not sure why, but sales in Moorpark showed an 
astounding increase of 55% in this year's first quarter compared to the same 
quarter in 1993. It's possible that people were buying merchandise to replace 
things that were damaged in the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Schniepp recalled, the first quarter of 1993 was "very depressed," making 
the first three months of this year look especially rosy.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: BIOSOURCE'S PROFITS FOR 3RD QUARTER DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consolidation and moving expenses diminished the third-quarter profit reported 
by BioSource International Inc., a Camarillo-based supplier of materials and 
test kits used in biomedical research. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported earnings of $85,664 in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 
compared to a year-earlier profit of $218,702.Sales totaled $1.62 million in 
the third quarter, up 12% from $1.45 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The third quarter results reflected $160,000 in costs related to the 
consolidation of the company's operations at a new facility in Camarillo, where 
the company has been based since 1990. Manufacturing, research, shipping and 
warehouse activities were moved from a facility in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "All employees except sales staff are now in one location and our monthly 
facility lease costs have been cut in half," said James Chamberlain, chief 
executive of BioSource. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of the year, BioSource reported earnings of $411,604 
on sales of $4.87 million, compared to a year-earlier profit of $419,021 on 
revenue of $4.06 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FORTUNE PETROLEUM REPORTS 3RD-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum Corp., an Agoura Hills oil and gas exploration and 
production company, reported a loss of $308,000 in the third quarter that ended 
Sept. 30, compared to a year-earlier loss of $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues in the third quarter tumbled 13% to $854,000 from $976,000 in the 
same three-month period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of the year, Fortune posted a loss of $972,000 on 
$2.6 million in revenues, compared to a $97,000 loss on revenues of $1.94 
million a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortune said the latest loss was due to lower natural gas prices and higher 
operating costs related to properties acquired by the company earlier this 
year. The nine-month loss also reflects a one-time charge of $225,000 to be 
paid over a two-year period to the company's former president, Dan E. Pasquini, 
who resigned on June 23.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: PIONEER ELECTRONIC FILES SUIT AGAINST TECHNICOLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Technicolor Videocassette Inc., based in Camarillo, has vowed to defend itself 
"vigorously" against a patent-infringement lawsuit filed in connection with the 
firm's fast-growing compact-disc duplicating unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by Discovision Associates, an Irvine-based subsidiary of 
Japan's giant Pioneer Electronic Corp., charges Technicolor with infringing on 
three of Discovision's U. S. patents in manufacturing and duplicating CDs and 
CD-ROMs.Discovision seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against further 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 CDs are the fastest-selling audio recordings. CD-ROMs look like CDs but can 
combine audio, video and text content. Technicolor has turned out millions of 
both kinds of items since starting to produce them in April for music 
distributors and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Fischel, Discovision's president and chief executive, says Technicolor 
Videocassette, a subsidiary of Technicolor Inc., has refused to enter into a 
licensing agreement. He says his company manages a worldwide portfolio of 1,400 
patents related to optical disc technology, the industry term for CD and CD-ROM 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is to make this technology widely available and to seek a return 
on our investment by licensing our patents on reasonable terms," Fischel said. 
"It's only fair to bring these proceedings against Technicolor Videocassette 
because we have a responsibility to our current licensees who are paying 
license fees." 
</P>
<P>
 But John H. Oliphant, Technicolor Inc.'s senior vice president for legal 
affairs, says management at the Camarillo plant was assured by outside advisers 
that its production line would not infringe on patents belonging to Discovision 
or any other firm. "When Discovision raised the issue, we asked which patents 
they were referring to and they refused to be specific," Oliphant said. "Then, 
without warning, they filed suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliphant said Technicolor will "defend ourselves vigorously" against the 
action, filed earlier this month in U. S. District Court in Delaware.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HEALTHTRONICS JOINS WITH BANK TO HANDLE CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Healthtronics, a private Woodland Hills provider of software and services to 
hospitals, said it has established a partnership with Inglewood-based Imperial 
Bank to handle insurance claims for doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said Imperial Bank, through its small business investment company, 
has bought a substantial equity interest in Healthtronics, but declined to say 
the value of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthtronics, which was founded in 1992, writes and manages computer programs 
for 50 health care providers, most of them in California and Texas. The 
programs allow hospitals to file insurance claims electronically instead of 
sending forms by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the alliance with Imperial Bank, Healthtronics will also be able to 
handle payment of insurance claims electronically, Healthtronics President 
Larry Lai said. Imperial Bank will provide Healthtronics with the equivalent of 
direct deposit for insurance reimbursements so that hospitals don't have to 
wait for checks from insurance companies to arrive by mail, he said.IMPERIAL BA

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: REXON PLANS RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RELATED TO ITS MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rexon Inc., the Simi Valley maker of computer backup systems, said it will 
take a restructuring charge in the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year that 
ended Oct. 2 because of costs related to moving the remainder of its operations 
out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of the charge, which includes severance pay and moving costs for 
employees, has not been determined, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rexon said more than half of the 140 workers at its Simi Valley facility will 
lose their jobs by the end of December. About 50 workers are expected to move 
to a newly opened plant in Longmont, Colo., or to Solon, Ohio, the site of 
Rexon's new headquarters, the company has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is part of a restructuring effort launched last year to help contain 
costs. The restructuring charge will also include the cost of writing off some 
inventory in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rexon said it expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter to be $52.7 
million, up 23% from the same period last year. For the full fiscal year, the 
company expects revenues of $205.5 million, up 8% from $188.2 million 1993.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: U. S. OKS SALE OF GLENDALE FEDERAL'S FLORIDA BRANCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank said the federal Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency has approved the applications of a Florida-based bank holding company 
to purchase 34 of Glendale Federal's Florida branches. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval represents the final regulatory decision required to complete the 
previously announced sale to Barnett Banks Inc. of Glendale Federal's 60 
Florida branches, which hold $3.5 billion in deposits.The sales price is $244 
million. The transaction is expected to close by Dec. 15, Glendale Federal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale-based savings and loan also recently agreed to sell its 
University Savings Bank franchise in Washington state, a sale expected to close 
in the first quarter of 1995. When that transaction is completed, Glendale 
Federal will have unloaded all of its out-of-state operations, leaving 132 
banking offices in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales will "allow us to focus our attention on building the value of the 
bank's California retail banking franchise, where we believe the greatest 
potential for growth resides," said Stephen J. Trafton, chief executive of 
Glendale Federal.

HARMONY HOLDINGS POSTS 1ST-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harmony Holdings Inc., a Burbank-based producer of special-effects television 
commercials and music videos, reversed a year-earlier loss in its fiscal first 
quarter that ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company posted earnings of $304,634 in the quarter, compared to a loss of 
$802,063 a year earlier. Revenues jumped 22% to $12.4 million from $10.2 
million in the same three-month period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony attributed the improved results to a restructuring undertaken last 
year, when the company consolidated accounting and other operations once spread 
among four divisions. The company also said it has benefited from customers 
expanding advertising budgets that had been tightened during the economic 
recession of recent years.

FOR HOME DEVELOPERS, MOMENTUM IS BUILDING; THE INDUSTRY IS EMERGING FROM 
RECESSION, BUOYED BY CHEAP LAND AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. BUT PRICES ARE STILL 
UNDER PRESSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the late '80s, when the market for new homes around the San Fernando Valley 
was at its best, whole subdivisions cropped up in a flash and people camped 
overnight for first dibs. Today, developers build new homes by the handful 
instead of by the hundred, and count themselves successful if they get a 
trickle of people to tour them each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for those who survived the housing slump this decade -- in which home 
prices have sunk to 1988 levels -- there are reasons to rejoice. In Ventura 
County, the Santa Clarita Valley and even in the San Fernando Valley, new homes 
are selling. Raw land is relatively cheap, and some banks are easing back into 
real-estate development again. Lending for new, mostly residential construction 
was $497 million in the third quarter this year for Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties, up from $179 million in the same period last year, said Dataquick 
Information Systems in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Although scores of local home developers have gone under, those small 
developers who remain in business have found that just surviving puts them in 
an elite class. "In this market if people are still standing with money in 
their pockets, you have to say they did something right," said Ken Edwards, 
executive vice president of the commercial real estate services group at Bank 
of America in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While recent years have been tough for small California home developers, 
several large, publicly traded home builders have moved in to take advantage of 
cheap land. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. in Los Angeles, the state's largest home 
builder. While many developers lost their properties because banks and S&Ls 
would no longer finance them, the $1.2-billion-a-year company gobbled up 
foreclosed land from banks or owners under duress. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks largely to this practice, Kaufman & Broad's share of the new-homes 
market in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys has risen to 30% from 
about 5% in the mid-80s, said Mark Beisswanger, president of the company's 
coastal valley division. "We took advantage . . . to buy properties of high 
quality for an appropriate price," Beisswanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Good deals on land have made it possible for Kaufman & Broad to offer homes at 
the low prices the market now demands -- something other developers, who bought 
land at the market peak, can't afford to do. 
</P>
<P>
 At California Stratford, a 181-lot Kaufman & Broad development on rocky slopes 
in West Hills, four- and five-bedroom houses starting at about $300,000 have 
sold briskly since April. The company started selling a group of 16 homes on a 
recent Saturday morning -- and had sold six by the end of the day. The houses 
have sweeping views of the Valley and are built with central staircases and 
open spaces instead of hallways. Rows of the compact homes rise from the dirt, 
and dozens of graded lots await construction. 
</P>
<P>
 So far Kaufman & Broad has built 84 homes here and sold 64 of them. The 
company is also selling homes at developments in Burbank, Simi Valley and 
Ventura County and will begin to sell homes in a development in Sylmar later 
this year. Those homes will be priced below $200,000. "When the proper value is 
provided, home buyers buy," Beisswanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another larger builder, Toll Brothers, based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., has 
launched a California division in recent months and plans a development in the 
Calabasas area, although they have not closed on a property yet. 
</P>
<P>
 And Del Webb Homes Inc., a Phoenix-based developer of retirement communities, 
has been working on a 95-home project in Valencia and is looking for new 
properties in the Santa Clarita and Ventura County markets. Del Webb began to 
focus on California around 1990, drawn largely by the abundance of cheap land 
here, said George Meeker, president of the Costa Mesa office. 
</P>
<P>
 For smaller home developers, though, the recent recession was something to try 
to survive, not gain by. "We made it. We are out the other side," said Bill 
Rheinschild, 37, owner of Van Nuys-based RWR Development Inc., a small company 
that has specialized in hillside properties in the San Fernando Valley area 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 After he lost the backing of a savings and loan for a development in Granada 
Hills, Rheinschild escaped foreclosure three years ago by selling other 
properties and three aircraft from his collection of antique warplanes. Only 
after finding new investors was he able to start building upscale homes in 
Granada Hills, and he is looking for new properties for the first time in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the recession hit, Rheinschild's sales dipped from $80 million per year 
to less than $5 million in 1993, he said. Rheinschild did manage to complete 
construction and sell the homes on three other developments after the market 
began its slide. But the Granada Hills site, which he bought in 1988, almost 
came to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 financing for construction at the site, called Greyhawk, was cut short 
when Rheinschild's lender, FarWest Savings & Loan Assn., was seized by banking 
regulators. Rheinschild had spent millions to install utilities and build model 
homes on the Granada Hills site but had no financing to start home 
construction. For a while, he said, "it was a little difficult to get up in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 15 of the first phase of 17 homes at Greyhawk have been sold since they 
were put on the market a year ago. Half sold in the last two months. 
Rheinschild has begun another phase of 10 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-bedroom houses with enough yard space for horse stables sell for 
$390,000 and up -- about $150,000 less than Rheinschild originally planned. "If 
I could build 30 houses before this time next year, I'd sell them," he said, 
adding that he may make a small profit this year after three years of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers of homes at Greyhawk include lawyers and accountants -- people who 
weathered the recession well and are prepared to take advantage of dipping 
prices. "We figured if the market went down more it wouldn't be by much," said 
Tamara Hawthorne, who recently stopped by her new Greyhawk house to inspect the 
limestone paving stones being laid in the entry and the brickwork upstairs. 
Hawthorne and her husband, Andrew, have two small daughters and needed a bigger 
home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For small developers like Rheinschild, finding financing is still the biggest 
problem. But he was lucky because a small Newport Beach lending company, Zephyr 
Capital Inc., stepped in to finance the completion of the homes in Granada 
Hills. Zephyr continues to lend in a market many banks won't touch, partly by 
tapping individual investors in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see ourselves as filling a void," said Zephyr Capital partner Robert 
Wilcox. But of the 10 investments Zephyr Capital has made so far, none are 
larger than $7 million, an amount that is just a fraction of typical 
real-estate development loans five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few banks have resumed making loans, they are doing so tentatively. 
Whereas once small developers would borrow tens of millions and build 100 homes 
at a time, now they borrow $10 million or less for development and construction 
costs, and they must carry 25% or more of the cost themselves to qualify for a 
loan, said Sam Lyons, of Great Western Bank subsidiary Bryant Financial. Great 
Western "quietly came back" to the construction lending business last year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new home development is Woodside Homes in Winnetka, with houses priced 
at no more than $194,000. They are closely packed together with very small back 
yards and a shared neighborhood swimming pool -- almost a townhouse 
arrangement, except that the homes are detached. These smaller homes are geared 
toward first-time buyers. "The magic cutoff point is $200,000," said Paul 
Walker, director of sales and marketing for Woodside. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside is owned by Sunnyglen Corp. in Newport Beach, a 25-year-old firm that 
has built large subdivisions, including several in Palos Verdes and San Pedro. 
Walker said Sunnyglen has been holding the Winnetka property for more than 20 
years, so it can still afford to sell the homes at low prices. Since April the 
first phase of 21 homes in Winnetka is almost sold out, and Walker said the 
sales office is busy with lookers. But even at these starter-home prices, 
Walker finds five or six would-be buyers for every one who actually qualifies 
for financing. 
</P>
<P>
 For small developers who have survived, the credit crunch remains pressing 
because the inventory of cheap land from foreclosures is running out, so land 
prices are creeping up. Housing values, though, keep falling. That means 
developers like Rheinschild must buy land soon or lose their chance because the 
few banks now lending for construction won't consider new projects unless they 
offer a healthy profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
 This narrowing gap between land and home prices threatens to squeeze out even 
more small developers and hand an even greater advantage to bigger companies, 
said Rheinschild, adding: "Nothing comes easy in this business."

BENTON OIL POSTS PROFITS OF $1.83 MILLION FOR 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil and Gas Co., the Oxnard-based energy concern, reported a dramatic 
surge in earnings in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, reversing a hefty 
year-earlier loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The company posted profits of $1.83 million in the third quarter, compared to 
a $1.21-million loss in the same three-month period of 1993.Revenues soared to 
$9.57 million from $1.7 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first three quarters, the company reported earnings of $1.83 million 
on revenues of $21.7 million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $2.69 million 
on $5.43 million in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex E. Benton, chief executive of the company, attributed the improved 
results to the success of the company's operations in the Gulf Coast region of 
Louisiana and in Venezuela. Domestic natural gas sales totaled 700 million 
cubic feet for the third quarter, compared to 58 million cubic feet during the 
same quarter last year. Sales from the company's Venezuelan operations totaled 
660,000 barrels in the third quarter, compared to 95,000 barrels during the 
same period in 1993.

WRAPPED UP IN OPTIMISM; RETAILERS EXPECTING A BIG HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, as voters they might be discontent. But as shoppers, Americans are 
expected to open their wallets wider this holiday shopping season. The nation's 
retailers have prepared themselves with bulging inventories in anticipation of 
what various polls and prognostications suggest may be the richest year-end 
shopping spree in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence is a national survey released Monday that shows widespread 
optimism among retailers about prospects for this holiday season. The survey -- 
sponsored by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche -- said 77% of retailers 
expect higher sales at their stores, compared to the 62% who expected increases 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey indicates that Southern California retailers are even more 
optimistic about their holiday prospects. The survey shows that 83% expect 
higher sales, compared to just 48% who expected increases last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting some very optimistic views from retailers," said Tony Cherbak, 
a partner with Deloitte & Touche in Costa Mesa. "I think it's shaping up to be 
a good season in Orange County. The results in L.A. and Orange County are very, 
very similar. We've got more optimism this year than last." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Deloitte & Touche survey shows a more upbeat view among retailers 
than among consumers -- and other samplings have painted a mixed picture -- the 
consensus among executives and experts who track consumer behavior is for 
spending increases of anywhere from 5% to 10%. They say it is a simple 
reflection of a strengthened economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers are more positive because there is less unemployment," said Allen 
Questrom, chairman of the Federated Department Store chain. "We expect a good 
holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday shopping surveys attract attention because they are often an indicator 
of consumer confidence. And this holiday season holds the potential to 
accelerate or stall the current economic recovery during the final 45 shopping 
days of the year, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deloitte & Touche findings are based on responses from 1,014 retailers and 
1,005 consumers nationwide. They are more optimistic than a recent Gallup Poll 
sponsored by the International Mass Retail Assn., which also turned up evidence 
that people plan to spend more this year, if only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Deloitte & Touche survey results were similarly more upbeat 
than other groups' attempts to predict holiday retail sales -- and were closer 
to the mark, as a late-season buying surge made 1993 the most profitable 
holiday season for retailers in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, consumers plan to spend an average of $714 this holiday season, an 
11% increase over last year's average of $646, the survey found. Consumers in 
the West plan to spend an average of $659, up 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gallup survey predicted average nationwide spending of $700 per consumer 
this year, compared to $685 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Federal Reserve Board report on economic conditions also said 
retailers in most of the country are optimistic about holiday retail sales 
growth. In addition, some credit card companies are expanding credit levels, to 
the delight of retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, demand for apparel will generate much of the additional spending 
this year, said Questrom, whose Federated operates Bloomingdale's and is 
nearing the final stages of a merger with R.H. Macy & Co., operator of 
Bullock's and I. Magnin.  
</P>
<P>
 Questrom predicts that designer apparel and children's clothing with symbols 
and logos from television's "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and Disney's movie 
"The Lion King" will be big sellers. Bullock's and other department stores also 
expect luggage, cookware and home furnishings to be popular this holiday 
season, Questrom said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Major retailers have already acted on such forecasts. Kmart spokesman Ron 
Pauli said his chain's inventories are "well-balanced to take advantage of 
stronger consumer demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Stores at Century City Shopping Center in Los Angeles are also stocking more 
heavily in anticipation of a brisk season. Doug Roscoe, the center's general 
manager, said merchants expect menswear, consumer electronics and home 
furnishings to be top sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our tenants are expecting gains in the 12% range," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Westminster Mall in Orange County, most stores are already reporting strong 
customer traffic and increased sales over last year, marketing manager 
Stephanie Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing people buying more . . . big-screen TVs, luxury personal items, 
high-tech electronic products and the like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the Glendale Galleria expect a 5% to 10% sales increase for the 
last 45 days of the year. Sales at the Westside Pavilion could jump as much as 
15% over last year, mall marketing director Mary Lankester said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Greg Johnson in Orange County contributed to this report. 
Holiday Sales Outlook 
</P>
<P>
 Most forecasters see strong holiday retail sales this year as the economic 
recovery continues, with spending in the West--dominated by 
Californians--weaker than elsewhere. But one survey finds retailers markedly 
more optimistic than consumers' plans would suggest: 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers and retailers are showing more confidence in spending... 
</P>

COSTAIN HOMES READY FOR BUILDING DEBUT IN O.C.; REAL ESTATE: COMPANY WILL 
SPECIALIZE IN DEVELOPING ABANDONED SCHOOL SITES, INCLUDING AN $8-MILLION PARCEL 
IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though it has been based in Orange County for nearly a decade, Costain Homes 
Inc. has never built a house here -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with a cash infusion from its publicly owned British parent company, 
Costain recently outbid some of the better-known local names in home building 
to buy an $8-million Fountain Valley property that was formerly a school. In 
what will be the company's first Orange County project, Costain plans to build 
more than 60 homes there priced at about $375,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which pioneered move-up housing in the Inland Empire, is also 
venturing into the Los Angeles market. Costain will pay about $18 million for 
54 acres in Thousand Oaks, where it plans to build nearly 200 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am positioning this company for future growth," said Julie Newcomb Hill, 
who is Costain's president and chief executive officer and, according to the 
trade publication Builder Magazine, the only woman now single-handedly running 
a publicly owned U.S. home-building company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 48, a former teacher, said Costain will specialize in acquiring 
abandoned school sites in some of the most affluent neighborhoods in Southern 
California. With about500lots in inventory, the company plans to build nearly 
200 homes in 1995, a far cry from a "painful time" during the early 1990s, Hill 
said, when the company got caught in the Inland Empire's downward real estate 
spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Costain has survived not only the real estate market slump but also internal 
turmoil -- two attempts to purchase the company from its British parent 
company, which has more than $2 billion in annual revenue. Just last year, when 
Costain Group PLC in London decided to shed its home-building arm in England, 
Hill arrived in London with heavyweight financial backers and made her own bid 
for the Orange County-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 Costain was so impressed with Hill's acumen that it decided to keep its Orange 
County building company and give Hill added fiscal incentives to remain in 
charge.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing a good job stabilizing the company and positioning it for a new 
round of growth," said Kenneth W. Agid, a real estate consultant in Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to take your hat off to her ability to deal with corporate 
politics long distance and keep the company going." 
</P>
<P>
 Now on surer footing, Costain Homes expects to report nearly $28 million in 
revenue this year from the sale of 177 homes, a slight increase. Last year, the 
company sold 171 homes for a total of $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Costain was recently selected for the first time by the Irvine Co., Orange 
County's largest landowner, to build homes in Irvine Ranch. But Hill turned 
down the prestigious offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is gearing the company instead to compete for increasingly scarce land 
with the larger publicly traded builders such as Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., 
California's largest. While Costain may be hampered now by its relatively small 
size and a British parent company sometimes unable to respond quickly to 
changing market conditions, competitors aren't underestimating Hill's vision or 
her marketing and sales skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's smart, she's been very aggressive recently on land acquisition, and 
Costain's got money," said Larry Webb, president of Greystone Homes Inc. in 
Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've been working through their problems, and she's getting them ready to 
grow. The fact that she's in control now signals to me that they will get 
bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 A former UCLA homecoming queen who graduated with honors, Hill grew up in the 
small San Bernardino County town of Colton. She attributes her success in part 
to ignoring bad advice -- like that of the high school guidance counselor who 
steered her away from business. 
</P>
<P>
 After teaching junior high school for several years, Hill took a position as 
general manager of marketing for Mobil Land Development, a subsidiary of Mobil 
Oil in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 After joining Costain in 1988, she became part of a team that attempted two 
years later to buy out the company. When the effort failed, her team members 
Hadi Makarechian and Dale Dowers went on to buy another Newport Beach home 
builder, J.M Peters Co. Hill, however, stayed on and was subsequently selected 
to lead Costain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Costain never seriously considered me as part of the buyout" attempt, Hill 
said. "They perceived that I cared, that I knew what was going on and that I 
would be able to lead." Costain Homes Inc. 
</P>

 The company saw its sales plummet when the real estate market soured in the 
early 1990s but is now positioning itself for future growth.

GERMAN FIRM TO ACQUIRE 51% OF AMERIQUEST; COMPUTERS: IT WILL GET ACCESS TO U.S. 
MARKET IN DEAL OFFICIALS SAY WILL BOOST IRVINE COMPANY'S SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A major German computer distributor said Monday that it has agreed to acquire 
a majority stake in AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. of Irvine in a transaction 
valued at about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer 2000 AG of Munich said it wants the 51% interest in AmeriQuest so it 
can start selling computers in the United States. Both companies said the deal 
will be good for AmeriQuest too, because it will give the Southern California 
company a strong partner and an opportunity to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the operating synergism generated through this alliance will 
immediately offer AmeriQuest greatly enhanced earnings power," said Hal Clark, 
AmeriQuest's co-chairman. "In addition, the $50-million infusion will provide 
us with the working capital necessary to finance rapid company expansion in 
1995 and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriQuest, formerly CMS Enhancements Inc., has 175 employees in Orange 
County. The investment by Computer 2000 is not expected to increase local 
employment immediately, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is subject to approval by both companies' shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 For AmeriQuest, Computer 2000's investment will give it a strong partner in an 
industry that has become "extremely price competitive" and "very difficult" for 
many distributors, said Robert Anastasi, computer analyst for the investment 
bank Robinson Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. AmeriQuest will probably gain a few new 
computer lines that are offered by Computer 2000, he said, while Computer 2000 
will get a "fast, relatively inexpensive . . . and reasonably broad entry into 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriQuest reported a loss of $7.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 
contrasted with a profit of $236,000 for the previous year. Annual sales were 
$87.6 million, a 20% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said at the time that it expects to exceed $1 billion in annual 
sales by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AmeriQuest closed at $3.50 
a share, down 12.5 cents.

<P>
 Luther Medical Products Inc., a medical device manufacturer, said Monday that 
MedChem Products Inc. has, as expected, withdrawn its proposal to buy Luther.

received the offer from MedChem to acquire Tustin-based Luther for cash and 
MedChem common shares.

 Triconex Corp. said Monday it has agreed to be acquired by Siebe PLC, 
Britain's largest engineering company, for $17.75 a share, or about $90 
million.

offer.  
</P>

 In Monday's Nasdaq trading, Triconex stock closed at $17.375 a share, up 44 
cents.

DISNEY THEME PARKS SEEK BROADER APPEAL; ENTERTAINMENT: NEW FLORIDA ATTRACTIONS 
COSTING $2 BILLION WON'T AFFECT ANAHEIM, COMPANY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Fighting back from slumping theme park attendance, the Walt Disney Co. plans 
to try to broaden the appeal of Anaheim's Disneyland and Florida's Walt Disney 
World beyond families, which historically have been their mainstay, a top 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company intends to spend upward of $2 billion on a new theme park, 
hotels and other amenities at its Florida operation, Disney theme park division 
President Judson Green said that doesn't mean less money will be available for 
projects in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Each proposal for a new theme park "stands project by project," Green said in 
a telephone interview. As such, spending in Florida should have no impact on 
whether Disney decides to go ahead with its plan to build a second theme park 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has continued to make major investments in Disneyland. Early next year, 
the park plans to open a lavish new ride based on the Indiana Jones character, 
and later it will refurbish the badly dated Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
 Green spoke in reaction to weekend news reports that Disney is spending $2 
billion to build new attractions in Florida to try to increase attendance, 
which has dropped by 5 million from a peak of 33.7 million annually four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney reportedly plans to build a yet unannounced theme park called Animal 
World, a cruise ship terminal near Orlando and three hotels by the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, meanwhile, the company has sent designers back to the drawing 
boards in an attempt to find a cheaper alternative to the $3-billion Disneyland 
Resort it had planned to build next to Disneyland. The project would have 
included an 80-acre theme park, 4,000 hotel rooms and an amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said Disney is "looking at a lot of options" in trying to decide what to 
build in Anaheim that could make Disneyland a more enticing destination for 
childless couples, so-called "empty nesters" whose children have grown and 
moved out and others who may not be responding now to Disney's family-oriented 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility, he confirmed, might be a nightclub and restaurant district in 
Anaheim, such as the one at the Florida theme park's Pleasure Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have instinctively appealed to families," he said. "The fact of the matter 
is we have a project that appeals to people of all ages and I think we're just 
more cognizant we need to find more ways to communicate what we have."

 Koll Real Estate Group Inc.: The Newport Beach real estate development 
services company incurred a net loss of $4.4 million, or 10 cents a share, for 
the third quarter, compared with a year-ago net loss of $2.1 million, or 5 
cents per share. The 1993 period included income from discontinued operations 
totaling $2.7 million.Revenue rose to $8.4 million from $2.2 million. The 
company said the increase reflects residential home sales, a golf course sale 
at the company's Wentworth By The Sea project in New Hampshire, and operations 
of the domestic real estate development business acquired from the Koll Co. in 
September, 1993. The company had a year-to-date net loss of $12.9 million, or 
30 cents a share. That compares with a year-ago net loss of $44 million, or 
$1.11 a share, which included a charge of $36 million from an accounting change 
in the first quarter. Revenue climbed to $16.6 million from $3.3 million.

LOSING HERSELF IN POLITICS; MAXINE QUIRK HAS BEEN ON THE BALLOT SEVEN TIMES IN 
THE LAST 12 YEARS AND HAS YET TO WIN A RACE. BUT THE PEACE AND FREEDOM 
CANDIDATE SAYS RUNNING FOR OFFICE LETS THE VOTERS KNOW THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES 
TO THE ESTABLISHED POWERBROKERS.

 Maxine Quirk apologized as she handed me the dashboard permit necessary to 
park my car on the street in front of her house in Old Town Orange. "I voted 
against having these. But then, I'm used to things not going the way I vote," 
she said, and it's the voice of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 If Democrats think they have cause to feel rejected, they should try being 
Quirk sometime. The 72-year-old activist has been on the ballot for seven 
elections during the past 12 years and has lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not just trounced by her major-party competition, she's all but beneath 
their notice. This time out, running as the Peace and Freedom Party candidate 
for State Board of Equalization, Quirk polled 44,087 votes, which might seem a 
respectable number until placed alongside winner Ernie Dronenburg's 1 
million-plus votes. Still, she considers it a good showing if she's able to 
draw 2% of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Quirk likes to crochet and to braid old-fashioned rugs. She's had no children 
of her own but has helped raise some 30 kids: nephews, nieces and others. She 
has a cat named Chi Chi Foo Foo. She reads, from the Nation to Tom Clancy. But 
chiefly, Quirk is a nonstop activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Peace and Freedom banner she has run twice for the State Board of 
Equalization and five times for the U.S. House of Representatives. She also is 
the Orange County chair of the party, as well as being the "convener" for the 
Orange County chapter of the Gray Panthers and secretary/treasurer for the 
peace-promoting Nippozan Myohoji Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a member of Vets of Peace and the Orange County Workers Coalition for 
Justice and Democracy, which supported the dry-wallers strike in the county. 
She fought against the passage of Proposition 187 and now is among those hoping 
to nullify it. In her spare time she works toward closing the School of the 
Americas in Ft. Benning, Ga., which she and others contend trains South 
American death squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost causes are practically in her blood.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the women got the vote, my mother voted for (five-time Socialist 
presidential candidate) Eugene Debs. I grew up in La Habra and Whittier, and we 
were in very close proximity to Richard Nixon. My family used to be Republican, 
but they went over to the Democrats after the Depression in 1929. So they 
worked against Nixon, not very successfully," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Quirk became politically active herself in the 1950s, precinct walking for 
Adlai Stevenson, one of the most brilliant, articulate and compassionate 
candidates this country has produced, and, of course, a big-time loser at the 
polls. That began a real streak for Quirk, who went on to locally support 
Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the outcome of last Tuesday's election was certainly enough to give 
her the impression she's paddling against a tidal wave, she didn't seem 
particularly daunted when we talked the morning after the vote. She'd been up 
nearly all night listening to the results come in on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me," she said. "I don't know why, except that I just feel 
like a very small percent of the people can make a very big difference. Maybe 
you don't get elected or maybe you don't do the things that the big money 
people do, but you have an influence on what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 If she ever did wake up to find she'd been elected, Quirk admitted her first 
act would be "to go into shock." 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly have never believed that I would get into government. And it 
doesn't matter to me. I just feel that I'm working for something that's good. 
Like Eugene Debs said, 'It's better to work for something that you want and 
lose than to work for something you don't want and win.' I think he hit the 
nail on the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Quirk had been a 30-year Democrat, though she had her doubts about the party 
in the early '70s when, precinct walking for McGovern, she found all of her 
Democratic neighbors were voting for Nixon. She began voting for Peace and 
Freedom candidates for lesser offices but stayed with her old party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then in 1979 when there was Three Mile Island, I thought, 'Both the 
Republicans and the Democrats are never going to do anything about this.' There 
is really no left left there. It's drifted to the right, and Democrats and 
Republicans are almost identical, and they're in somebody's pocket both of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so I just switched. I was really glad I did because people in the Peace 
and Freedom Party seem much more active to me. That was the beginning of a lot 
of really active times, the anti-nuclear movement was really big, the 
opposition to registration for the draft, then Central America," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she decided to try for public office herself in 1982, her years of 
campaigning for others had prepared her for the trials of going door to door. 
</P>
<P>
 "You develop a thick skin once you get into politics. I know the first year I 
ran, I'd go up and knock on a door and say I was running for office with the 
Peace and Freedom Party, and people would make all kinds of funny remarks, 
like, 'Well, it's not going to take them long to wipe that grin off your face.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 She's never been tempted to move to a political climate more hospitable than 
the famously right-leaning Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up here. I accept it for what it is. And I find that people have 
become pretty accepting of me because I'm not a fanatic. When I first started 
having the Peace and Freedom Party phone here at my home, I would get a lot of 
hate calls from people threatening to bomb and calling me a dirty Commie. But 
I've been running for office long enough and circulated enough that people know 
I'm not that kind of person, so I think they accept me for what I am," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than view government in an us-versus-them light, she sees it as a tool 
its citizens can use to create a better life. She also believes that compassion 
should be a part of that national will.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very strong Pennsylvania Dutch background, and we were just brought 
up to be caring people," she said. "Sharing and caring are the main goals I'm 
after I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 A long-divorced husband had purchased a number of investment properties, and 
Quirk still owns 14 apartments in Santa Ana, which she manages and maintains 
herself. "There are people in Peace and Freedom who jokingly call me a 
slumlord. I'm not a very effective landlord. I rent my apartments out for $230, 
and I pay the utilities. I just -- most of the time -- make a living wage off 
them. My tenants are Latinos, and I'm very close to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 to me seems so un-Christian and so against brotherly love. 
This split over 187 in California is almost as bad as the Vietnam War, because 
it so divided people. And it is so unkind, because this country has gone down 
there and screwed that country up, and numerous others besides. We have created 
a lot of their problems, have really exploited them to the max. It doesn't make 
any sense to me that there could be so much hate against people we have wronged 
so terribly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So why would an activist with such strong feelings run for an administrative 
post like State Board of Equalization? 
</P>
<P>
 Quirk explained, "I hate to admit this, but I ran . . . so I wouldn't have to 
work (at campaigning). I was busy with other things. It's a regulatory body, 
and it has no issues, so you don't get invited to do anything, and this freed 
me up to work against 187 and the other things I'm involved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually prefer running for Congress because you have more of an opportunity 
to get into nationwide issues. I have really enjoyed it because I have been 
able to go speak in the schools and get interviewed by the press, though 
sometimes I do a real long interview and get one line in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 She rarely gets to face off against her high-powered opposition, though two 
years ago she did get to appear on cable TV in a forum with Rep. Christopher 
Cox (R-Newport Beach). Rather than acrimony, Quirk said she felt a certain 
kinship with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very good experience. When you run for office, you feel you have 
something in common with the others there, even though you may disagree with 
them totally. After you've run for office, you feel it's kind of like a club 
you're in where you feel like you have something in common with everyone who's 
ever run, even if they're doing it on a different level and for different 
reasons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her reasons for running for offices that she never thinks she'll win is 
just letting people know, by the Peace and Freedom presence on their ballots, 
that there are alternatives to the established powerbrokers. Along with the 
Libertarians and the American Independent Party, the Greens also fielded 
several candidates this year. That's all for the good, Quirk maintains, though 
it does spread the vote thinner among the struggling parties, each of which 
must claim at least 2% of the vote in gubernatorial elections to maintain a 
presence on future ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 And will we still have Quirk to kick around in those elections? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I don't know. I'm 72, and I was thinking maybe this would be the 
last time. And it's so hard getting the signatures to qualify. Sometimes I get 
kind of discouraged being in an other party, but then I think, 'Where would I 
go?' And there isn't anywhere to go. I can't imagine ever giving up my beliefs 
for the underdog.  
</P>
<P>
 "Like the kids say," she concluded with a laugh, " 'It's a job, somebody dirty 
has to do it.' "

THE ARTFUL WORK DODGER GIVES UP THE CHASE; FOR YEARS, AUTHOR FRAN LEBOWITZ'S 
ROMANCE WITH THE MEDIA BLOCKED HER CREATIVITY. BUT REALIZING THAT NOT WRITING 
WAS TOO MUCH WORK, SHE DOVE BACK IN WITH A CHILDREN'S BOOK.

<P>
 Welcome to sunny Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Which happens to be unbelievably drab, drizzly and all-around icky this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this I didn't have to get on a plane and not smoke for 6 1/2 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Lebowitz is bemoaning her climatic fate in high style, specifically, a 
corner room in the Regent Beverly Wilshire. She is making up for lost smoking 
time and doing what she does best, which is talk, a much underrated career 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly beat writing after Lebowitz's phenomenal literary success in the 
early '80s turned her into the much-quoted, not-writing Dorothy Parker of New 
York. Indeed, Lebowitz's overnight change of fortune, triggered by one 
killer-great New York Times review, ignited such Angst for her that it helped 
spark a notorious decade-long bout with writer's block. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it has been miscalled a writer's block," she says in a rasp thick 
with cigarettes. "A writer's block is obviously a temporary situation. It's a 
week, a month. This was like a writer's blockade. This was on the same schedule 
as the Vietnam War." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace has been declared. It's D-day in Lebowitz's much-beleaguered literary 
career. Alfred A. Knopf has just published her first children's book, "Mr. Chas 
and Lisa Sue Meet the Pandas," a tart little volume illustrated by architect 
Michael Graves that includes such Lebowitz-oid characters as Don't Panda to 
Public Taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The book turns on Don't Panda and Pandamonium, a coupla pandas hiding in a New 
York apartment building and yearning to breathe free -- in dog costumes in 
Paris, that is, because "in Paris dogs can go anywhere, even inside 
restaurants, where they have chocolate eclairs." The requisite children's-book 
children set out to help them. Lebowitz, who says she has always wanted to 
write a children's book, still reads them. "I'm a promiscuous reader," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more significant, Lebowitz, 44, has returned -- intermittently -- to 
her sweeping novel of manners, "Exterior Signs of Wealth," begun and abandoned 
on the heels of her two volumes of humorous essays, "Metropolitan Life" (1978, 
Dutton) and "Social Studies" (1981, Random House). She's been writing it in the 
shadow of Graves' Princeton, N.J., home -- in another home owned by Graves, 
actually -- which gave her a clear shot at nagging him to draw her pandas. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought, 'Michael doesn't have time to do this.' Unluckily for 
him, I lived right in front of him, and I would do things like call him and 
say, 'Are you drawing? I see the light on in the kitchen. You're eating. Draw.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the one time in my life I was ever in the position of being the one 
who was done. Never before in my life could I say this, so it was kind of 
entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebowitz was a 27-year-old high-school dropout from Morristown, N.J., when 
John Leonard crowned her debut volume, "Metropolitan Life," "a hilarious shock" 
in the pages of the New York Times. The review was virtually a string of quotes 
from her book, setting the stage for her highly quotable life. The ensuing 
romance with the media was flattering at first, but eventually hearing her own 
distinctively dry wit resonate on and on proved highly problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped writing these essays because I kept hearing that voice not only in 
my writing but talking all the time, and having it quoted back to me and seeing 
it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And being in the eye of the media was destructive because "it is the diametric 
opposite of writing. That kind of attention on an actor is fine. It's almost 
the same thing as acting. But it's the absolute opposite of writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing is to be alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing is to be silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing is to be contemplative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing is all those things that are the opposite of what the media is." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the choice, Lebowitz went with the media. But it wasn't necessarily a 
good swap. Ultimately, all that wit incited some backlash in the press, which 
Lebowitz writes off to the hazards of plying the humor trade as a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of humor that is most acceptable in this country, particularly for 
women, is self-deprecating humor. Some people respond inadequately to me 
because they are brought up to be offended by (the opposite) stance in a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are first of all not supposed to be funny . . . because humor is 
perceived as aggression, no matter what kind of humor it is. Women are not 
meant to be aggressive in any way, but particularly in a way that is almost 
wholly cerebral. "Men make the jokes. Men make the laws. Men make the money. 
And then women write about other women badly because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 All of that segued nicely with Lebowitz's much-heralded talent for sloth. "I'm 
like the laziest person who ever lived. It's amazing to me I even sit up." 
</P>
<P>
 So for years, Lebowitz made a life out of reading by day, hitting New York's 
A-list parties by night, riding the college lecture circuit and not writing. 
She also spent some time fending off Hollywood. She would say no. They would 
think she meant yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Hollywood, the more you say no, the higher your price will go. I'm the 
highest-priced non-screenwriter in the world. It's like date rape. 'She said, 
"No." What do you think she wants?' How about nothing? 
</P>
<P>
 "So I once actually sat in the executive dining room of a movie studio and a 
person said to me, 'All right, all right, I suppose you want to direct.' And I 
said, 'Look, we both know that you would never allow me to direct a movie. 
Second of all, I don't know how to direct a movie. And third of all, I don't 
want to direct a movie.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not interested in writing movies because it's not a writer's medium. . . 
. I'm not interested in writing movies because the screenwriters I know are the 
most unhappy people I have ever seen in my entire life. . . . And in my 10 
years of making my rent barely, schlepping to Altoona, Pennsylvania, to these 
colleges, I never once thought, 'Fran, all you have to do is pick up the phone 
and you can write a movie and you can pay your bills.' I may be on Joe's 
Airline going to Nowheresville, but I never wanted to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But not writing turned out to be not all it was cracked up to be. If not 
writing made Lebowitz feel like a "writing felon," then writing made her feel a 
little less felonious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I may have reached the point where I became aware that not writing 
was really harder. Because when I started writing my life became 
instantaneously easier. I used a tremendous amount of psychic energy to not 
write. And so when I used that to write, it took less.  
</P>
<P>
 "So for the lazy person it was perfect. It was less effort." 
</P>
<P>
 And growing up meant she learned to cultivate a certain distance when it came 
to the media. The column mentions, the quoted fripperies, the prospect of 
reviews didn't seem to matter so much. They all finally cleared a path to the 
writing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then you go back to the writing room where no one can be as hard on the 
book as you could. No one. 'I'm sorry, but I passed that page. You can't fail 
it.' And that's the upside of middle age."

GO WITH THE FLOW; THE UNNATURAL WAY YOU MOVE YOUR BODY MAY BE CAUSING YOU PAIN. 
THINK OF THE HAND, FINGERS AND ARM AS ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nina Scolnik's hands move with grace and precision across the grand piano 
keyboard in her living room. Then she abandons Chopin and slides off the piano 
bench to settle onto a chair at her dining table, where a computer keyboard 
awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 There she types as if she were playing an etude, then stops to explain the 
connection she sees: 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're a butcher, court stenographer, landscaper, concert pianist or 
computer operator, if you want to cure aching fingers, hands, arms and back, 
you needn't resort to splints, wrist rests, stretching exercises or surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Just learn the basic, natural movements that successful pianists have relied 
on for centuries, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not with the computer, the cash register or the meat cleaver, 
says Scolnik, 41, a piano faculty member at UC Irvine. "The problem is with the 
way people move. The finger, the hand, the arm must move as a unit." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the basic idea emanating from a Brooklyn woman who has taught piano 
for 50 years. During that time, Dorothy Taubman has spawned thousands of 
disciples of the Taubman method, known largely within the U.S. piano community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blaming the instrument," says Taubman, 76, "is like saying that writer's 
cramp is caused by the pencil." Or the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Taubman and her colleagues, including Scolnik, are launching a nationwide 
business to transfer what they know to the broader realm of non-musicians who 
suffer from repetitive stress injury, or RSI. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimed at teaching people how to use computers with techniques previously 
reserved for musical instruments, the company offers workshops to retrain 
injured workers and to train those who want to prevent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 As the RSI problem has mushroomed to afflict everyone from secretaries to 
executives with hurting muscles, tendons and nerves, Taubman and her associates 
have been approached on occasion by businesses wanting to see if the technique 
could help. But only recently has the Taubman Institute decided to focus on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people out there in trouble (who) can't get help, and this 
little lady has figured it all out -- what the medical profession has not 
figured out," says Taubman Institute Executive Director Enid Stettner, who 
lives in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 To initially spread the word, Taubman is relying on two dozen faculty members 
who teach at her institute, held each summer at Amherst College in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Key among them is Scolnik, the principal West Coast advocate of Taubman's 
methods. Since the late 1970s, she has been associated with Taubman and has 
introduced many of her own students to the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Taubman consulting firm starts up, one of Scolnik's former UC Irvine 
piano students, Greg Dempster of Laguna Beach, has also begun what he bills as 
the first company "in the country to adapt this approach to the business 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1983 to early this year, Dempster studied with Scolnik, who introduced 
him to Taubman's ideas. "At first I thought this was really snake oil, that 
this was from Mars," says Dempster, 34, who completed his undergraduate and 
master's work with Scolnik. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon Dempster, who had been injured from his earlier technique, became a 
believer. For six summers, he studied with Taubman at Amherst and was a 
teaching assistant at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was teaching one of his own students who worked as a computer operator, 
Dempster says, "It became obvious that this applied quite directly to computer 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past few months, Dempster has put together a staff including other 
Taubman devotees and has already been offering seminars and making a pitch to 
intrigued representatives of Southern California companies. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent seminar at the Irvine Hyatt Regency, he spoke to a small 
gathering, including representatives from Orange County businesses interested 
in this new tactic to combat RSI. 
</P>
<P>
 "Correct movement minimizes effort, fatigue," he says. "If you are not moving 
correctly, there is a level of fatigue you are operating under." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he cites the problem of hitting the keys too hard. "Anybody 
have an idea of the weight it takes to displace a computer key? It's about a 
gram or gram and a half. Your forearm weighs about 15 pounds. So this is always 
a winning battle." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dempster's request, his seminar students stand with hands and arms by their 
sides. Then he outlines another of Taubman's main ideas. "Notice how your hands 
hang. No two are alike. Everybody's hand will look different on the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The natural profile of the wrist, at rest, at your side -- that is more or 
less the profile it should have when it's moving or performing work. Any time 
you distort that, so that any of the joint structure is out of the mid-range 
arc of motion, you develop problems." 
</P>
<P>
 That means avoid curling your fingers, avoid twisting your hands into 
positions that would mimic actor Charlie Chaplin's famous splayed feet antics 
and avoid stretching your fingers to reach unnaturally. 
</P>
<P>
 To trouble-shoot for these tendencies in his students, Dempster asks one of 
them, Michael F. McCrackin, Fluor Daniel's safety manager at its Irvine 
facility, to sit before a computer keyboard. McCrackin begins to type. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempster spots a problem and coaches him to keep his hands in line with their 
natural curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, McCrackin says, his company saw there was a problem with 
RSI -- that typing on a computer is different from using a typewriter. "We 
started throwing things at the problem -- wrist rests, articulated keyboard 
platforms. But we didn't address how people were using the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ergonomic solutions have been insufficient, he says. And it's not enough to 
tell someone to align the body properly, to keep the wrists relatively straight 
or to take frequent breaks. Many people, he says, must be completely retrained. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrackin expects 300 to 400 of the 2,500 employees of the Irvine-based 
international engineering firm to fall into the "high-risk" category -- those 
needing retraining to cure and existing RSI problem or to prevent one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty excited by this whole concept. I'm impressed by the level of 
detail," he says. Even basic training, he says, would be beneficial. "You don't 
need to know how a car works to learn to drive it, to get the proper 
instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Garry S. Brody, medical director of the Hand Rehabilitation 
Center at USC University Hospital, says: "Nothing else works. And you have to 
do surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he says much is still unknown about RSI. "We're all struggling to 
know, No. 1, what's really behind all this and, No. 2, how to prevent it and 
how to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the Taubman approach goes, he says until scientific studies are done 
to verify the anecdotal claims, skepticism is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say a couple of months of trial won't do any harm. But if after a 
month or two you still have the problem, you'd better look for a more 
conventional treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, he adds: "Nobody ever died from a carpal tunnel problem. It's not 
a crippling disease. The problem is the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 To find what common ground might exist with medicine, music and the Taubman 
technique, an Oakland occupational health physician is starting a research 
project on injured pianists. 
</P>
<P>
 William A. Pereira, 45, is undertaking the work as part of degree studies at 
UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. A pianist since age 7, he has studied 
with Scolnik and Taubman. While living in Orange County and working as a 
physician in the 1980s, he completed a bachelor's in music with Scolnik at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do something to get this information more available to the 
mainstream in the medical community," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I know of physiology, the ideas (Taubman) is saying make complete 
sense. The motions involved in piano playing are often invisible. Dorothy's 
genius was figuring them out and how they connect with muscles and movement. It 
was like analyzing a wave form, and she broke it all down." Preventing 
Repetitive Stress 
</P>
<P>
 The study of ergonomics--how people work--shows hand-arm alignment is at the 
center of keyboard repetitive stress injuries (RSI). Misalignment causes 
muscles to become overworked, causing stress and fatigue in the hands and arms. 
In retraining, piano and computer keyboard users learn how to move without 
causing the injuries. Signs of RSI 
</P>
<P>
 Repetitive stress injuries can have a variety of symptoms including muscle 
fatigue and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Puffy skin surface: General sign of stressed or overworked muscle group that 
flexes fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ganglions: Small cysts beneath skin form as result of stressed muscles that 
flex fingers and hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finger numbness: May be caused by inflammation of nerves in wrist when 
muscle that extends wrist rests on hard surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elbow swelling: Could indicate twisting and resulting stress of muscle that 
rotates wrist when arm is palm down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wrist pain: Often caused by inflamed muscles constricting nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forearm ache: Usually indicates inflamed biceps which contracts arm and 
moves hand side to side. Top Causes of Injury 
</P>
<P>
 The most common poor keyboard postures cause the wrist joint to move beyond 
its range of motion, which leads to physical problems. The three most common 
incorrect keyboarding practices and their symptoms: 
</P>
<P>
 * Twisting: Long muscles in arms forced to stretch around the elbow, which 
stresses muscles in hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms: Elbow inflammation, throbbing in forearm, loss of dexterity of 
little and ring fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over-curled fingers: Continuously flexed muscles that contract and extend 
wrist cause nerve compression in wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms: Pain in wrist or forearm; tingling or numbness in fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dropped wrists: Tendons press against nerves in wrist area, weakening the 
thumb, index and ring fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms: Numbness, tingling in fingers at night; swelling of wrist and/or 
thumb joint. Posture Perfect 
</P>
<P>
 Computer desks and keyboards can be equipped to ensure good posture and proper 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arm at 90-degree angle 
</P>
<P>
 * Keyboard at elbow height 
</P>
<P>
 * Back straight 
</P>
<P>
 * Thighs, forearms parallel with floor 
</P>
<P>
 * Wrist straight Ergonomic Equipment 
</P>
<P>
 * Padded wrist rests 
</P>
<P>
 * Cushioned keys 
</P>
<P>
 * Elbow rests 
</P>
<P>
 * Adjustable computer table 
</P>
<P>
 * Sliding keyboard holder 
</P>
<P>
 * Foot rest Futuristic Typing 
</P>
<P>
 New keyboards are designed to encourage good typing posture. This one, for 
example, splits in half and has built-in padded wrist rests, encouraging a 
naturally relaxed position of fingers, hands and wrists. Typing Test 
</P>
<P>
 Score your knowledge of good keyboard technique with these true-or-false 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Only the fingers should move. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Shoulders should be relaxed and dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Keys must be pushed to bottom of stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Wrists should rest on edge of table or on wrist pad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Answers 
</P>
<P>
 1. False: Entire arm should move and get involved in the process. The elbow 
should act as a stable hinge supporting the forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 2. False: Shoulders should be relaxed, but dropped shoulders cause the long 
tendons to hold the arm in place, stressing the elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 3. False: Keystroke is complete through the top two-thirds of the motion. 
Finger muscles should be at rest at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 4. False: Resting the wrist on table edge can cause nerve damage. Use pads as 
guides for proper alignment, not as pillows.

 In the news: On the Leonardo da Vinci manuscript auctioned Friday for $30.8 
million: Comedy writer Mark Miller says the figure tops the $27.4-million 
record for a Steven Seagal manuscript arguing his movies are different from one 
another.

 Archivists who examined the manuscript were puzzled over words like milk and 
butter until they realized they were part of a grocery list dictated by Mrs. da 
Vinci. (Bob Mills)

 Jay Leno, on Sydney Biddle Barrows' new job as "expert" commentator for the 
Heidi Fleiss trial at one of the cable channels: Instead of hiring a legal 
expert, they got a woman who made her name as a madam. "They figured it's a few 
bucks cheaper, and she essentially does the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey shows a growing number of lawyers are unhappy in their 
profession. Comedy writer Alan Ray says the news gets even more disturbing: "A 
number are happy in their jobs." Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on the bogus BBC 
announcement that the Queen Mother had died: "Former Secretary of State 
Alexander Haig, who was traveling in England, held a press conference and 
declared, ' I'm in charge here.' "

some money," Peyser says.

 Election aftermath: Because of the recent Republican landslide, Clinton may 
replace his once-favorite song "Don't Stop," which beckons listeners to think 
about tomorrow, to "Yesterday," says reader Gary Easley. And Mills says: "Aides 
of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato were barely able to talk Sonny Bono out of replacing 
the nation's anthem with 'I Got You Babe.' "

BODY WATCH; CRUNCH APPEAL; HOLD THE PUDDING AND PORRIDGE, AND PASS THE POTATO 
CHIPS AND POPCORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Chicago dietitian Alicia Moag-Stahlberg is under stress and hungry, 
she'll usually snack sensibly on low-fat popcorn or pretzels. But sometimes 
nothing will do but extra crunchy shoestring potatoes -- even though they pack 
a wallop of fat and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a regular potato chip," she explains. "These shoestring 
potatoes crunch more." 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the appeal for Moag-Stahlberg and millions of other noisy 
noshers: They're hooked on crunch appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's not a lot of science behind why we crave crunchy foods, there 
are several reasonable theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunchy foods can ease tensions after a long day, says Elizabeth Ward, a staff 
dietitian for the Harvard Community Health Plan, Boston, and a spokeswoman for 
the American Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about what it feels like to chew something very crunchy," she suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compare an apple to applesauce. The apple takes so much more work to grind it 
with your teeth that you are using those muscles in your face that you may 
tense up during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Tense people can also feel the effects of stress in their neck and shoulder 
areas, she adds, and eating something crunchy might help relax those muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward adopted the tension-reducing theory after her sister-in-law explained her 
fondness for rice cakes by saying, "It just tastes so good to chew." 
</P>
<P>
 Although crunchy foods aren't meant as a substitute for stress-reduction 
classes or an hour with a good therapist, Dr. Mark Goulston says the 
tension-reducing theory makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the world bites you, you want to bite back," says the Santa Monica 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is scientific literature on cravings, "there is not a lot of 
science about why one craves crunchy foods and another craves smoother foods," 
Moag-Stahlberg says. "But we eat for a lot of reasons. Hunger is one of the 
lower ones (on the list). Sensory satisfaction is way up high, and part of that 
is not only taste but texture. People like in-your-face eating experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Crunchiness can also enhance the sensory experience of eating, according to 
food chemists, who, of course, don't call it crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food chemists talk about fractureability," explains Susan Brewer, an 
associate professor of foods and nutrition at the University of Illinois, 
Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of hard candy. When you put it between your back teeth and bear down, 
it fractures and falls away from the pressure rather than compressing or 
smashing or sticking to your teeth. Normally, that (fractureability) is one of 
the main aspects of crunchiness -- the ability to fracture off cleanly, as 
opposed to sticking to the teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 And let's not overlook the auditory dimension of The Crunch. ("For some 
eaters, sound is very important," Brewer says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Or its place as a diet aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good crunchy foods, in general, are high in fiber and are filling," Ward 
says. "They take longer to chew than other foods. You feel like you've really 
eaten something." 
</P>
<P>
 But it might not be a good idea for dieters to rely only on fat-free crunchy 
foods, particularly because part of the appeal of crunchy foods might be the 
fat and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Moag-Stahlberg suggests indulging in small portions of crunchy foods with fat 
and salt, satisfying the crunch/salt/fat urge in one fell swoop. Better to have 
a few crackers with salt and fat and feel full than to have a half-gallon of 
air-popped corn and still feel deprived. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunchy foods could also be a boon for dental health, although those with jaw 
problems are wise to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain crunchy foods that act as detergents on the teeth -- your 
natural plaque removers, like fresh fruits and vegetables," says Linda Niessen, 
professor of dentistry at Baylor College of Dentistry, Dallas. But crunchy 
refined foods -- because of added ingredients such as sugars and complex 
starches -- could promote tooth decay. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunching ice is discouraged, Niessen says, because "it can cause microscopic 
cracks in the enamel, which can weaken the tooth." Biting down too forcefully 
on peanut brittle, hard candy or other hard foods can harm the teeth, too. 
</P>
<P>
 If crunch adds variety and pleasure, go for it, nutritionists advise. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ward: "Because we get hung up on nutrients, we tend to overlook that 
eating is also a psychological experience. And it has to be satisfying on so 
many levels for people to feel nourished."

BODY WATCH; MUSHY DOESN'T DO IT FOR CONSUMERS 
</P>

<P>
 In recent years, crunch has become the cornerstone of major advertising 
campaigns by produce growers and food manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 To sell apples, for instance, the Washington State Apple Commission used to 
focus on the health benefits of its fruit, spokesman Jim Thomas says. Then 
about four years ago, the emphasis shifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We changed the message from 'Eat apples because they're good for you' to 'Eat 
apples because they're crunchy and juicy,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born the apple commercial, aired regularly on radio and television, 
with people opening wide, then biting down. The closing line simply says: 
"Washington apples: They're as good as you've heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Apples shipped by the commission must meet a rigid "crunch standard." That 
means in pre-shipment sample testing, "There has to be at least 12 pounds of 
resistance before the apple is punctured," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple growers don't have a corner on crunch. Last year, the Nabisco Foods 
Group's Planters Division introduced Caribbean Crunch, a low-fat fruit and nut 
snack, and Sweet 'N Crunchy, peanuts coated with a sugar-and-butter crunch 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaker Oats talks about crunch appeal on the label of its Cinnamon Crunch rice 
cakes. And the company is now test marketing Crunch'ums, a fat-free puffed 
snack food, spokeswoman Laura Jackson says. 
</P>
<P>
 General Mills has just introduced Sun Crunchers, a cereal of corn flakes, 
whole wheat flakes and pieces of sunflower seeds, says spokeswoman Kathryn 
Newton. Two established cereals, Wheaties and Cheerios, have gotten crunchier 
with recent product improvements, she adds, with the Wheaties box now promising 
"Better taste, bigger crunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Chalk it all up to consumer demand, says Elizabeth Faullin, of Nabisco Foods 
Group. In a market-research survey conducted in mid-1993, Nabisco asked 150 
adults -- ages 18-65 -- what they look for when buying salty snacks. 
Crunchiness was outranked only by taste (No. 1) and price (No. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 In consumer surveys conducted by the Washington State Apple Commission, says 
Thomas, "Crunch has always come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Apple eaters associate the crunch sound with "positive images of eating apples 
in the past," Thomas says. And with that, he says, often comes relaxation. 
"People usually take a break while eating an apple."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; SMITHSONIAN PAYS TRIBUTE TO AN ART INSTITUTION; 
CERAMIST BEATRICE WOOD, 101 AND RECOVERING FROM A RECENT ILLNESS, ATTENDS VIA 
SATELLITE THE DINNER HONORING HER WORKS AND HER VIEW OF LIFE.

 Beatrice Wood, the 101-year-old ceramist and "mama" of Dada -- the radical art 
movement of the early 1900s -- offered wise and witty commentary on politics, 
art and sexuality Saturday when she was honored by the Smithsonian 
Institution's Archives of American Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she was recovering from a recent illness, Wood could not accept the 
archives' Esteemed American Artist Award in person at the Surf and Sand in 
Laguna Beach. Instead, she communicated with the 130 guests via satellite from 
her home in Ojai.  
</P>
<P>
 The $500-per-person dinner was expected to net $40,000 for the archives, which 
collects the records of American artists for research. Of Men and Chocolate 
</P>
<P>
 To actress Tippi Hedren, the evening's honorary chairwoman, Wood is much more 
than a great artist: 
</P>
<P>
 "She's my wonderful friend and mentor. I'm sorry I haven't known her all of my 
life," Hedren said. "Her whole philosophy of life is having fun and doing and 
saying outrageous things. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 101, she still watches Ted Koppel every night. She has an opinion on 
everything. And, she's an incredible flirt." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hedren introduced Wood "live from Ojai," guests "oohed" when the image 
of the artist came on a big screen. Wrapped in her trademark saris and sporting 
silver bangles, the white-haired Wood gleefully fielded questions from the 
audience, making numerous references to her oft-quoted secret to longevity: 
chocolate and young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarking on her age, she said, "Actually, I'm only 32." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the origin of her nickname "Beato," she explained that a friend's 
baby -- now 60 -- could not pronounce "Beatrice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, it's easier to sign pottery 'Beato.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up her art, she described herself as an artist rather than a 
craftsman, not worrying whether her work was technically perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "My interest was not in art. It was in being in love. I think that's how it 
should be for women." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about her future plans, she said: "I hope still to be able to work, and 
I like laughing at young men." 
</P>
<P>
 She then invited the entire group up to her home, with one condition: 
"Chocolate is my passport. Anyone who comes here must bring chocolate if they 
want a nice visit." Toast by Satellite 
</P>
<P>
 Hedren was joined at the podium by archives board president Max Berry and 
archives director Richard Wattenmaker, who presented Wood with the award -- a 
cushion-shaped sterling silver bowl from Tiffany & Co. engraved with an 
irreverent stick figure created by Wood in the '20s for a ball in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast ended with guests standing to toast the artist and sing a few 
refrains of "For she's a helluva potter." 
</P>
<P>
 Many were impressed by the high-tech production. Gerald Buck, an archives 
board member from Orange County, noted that Wood was born in 1893 when "the 
light bulb was just coming on," and with the gains in technology made during 
her lifetime "she's coming to us via satellite." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Wood still missed out on one portion of the evening: an elegant 
dinner of roasted filet mignon or halibut with tarragon sauce served at tables 
adorned with greenery and pots filled with ceramist's tools. In Wood's honor, 
dessert was a mousse torte of pure chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the dinner benefit the archives' West Coast center at the 
Huntington Library in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck was largely responsible for bringing this year's awards dinner to Laguna: 
"I think it's time Orange County had a national event to recognize one of 
California's great artists," said Buck, who attended with his wife, Bente. 
</P>
<P>
 The archives is the largest collection of records on American art in 
existence. More than 12 million objects, including letters, photographs, 
sketches and other documents from American artists, are available to 
researchers at centers across the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Wood is the oldest living artist to have given her papers to the archives. 
"She's a living link to the past," said Paul Karlstrom, director of the 
archives on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Faces in the crowd included Ram Pravesh Singh, Wood's manager; Electa 
Anderson, event coordinator; Kathryn Linehan, who produced a film on Wood shown 
to guests; Darrel Anderson and Marsha Grinberg; Robert and Mary Anne Emett; Pat 
Hancock; Mary Hendrickson; Patricia House; Gilbert and Victoria LeVasseur; 
Carolyn Machado; William and Irene Matthews; John and Susie Meindi; Jim and Pam 
Muzzy; Jo Ellen Qualls; Elaine Redfield; Bud and Marilyn Schlain, and David and 
Susan Starry-Sheets. KATHRYN BOLD

R S V P; A GRAND TURNOUT FOR A FINE CAUSE 
</P>

<P>
 The National Conference of Christians and Jews had dual blockbusters at its 
31st annual Entertainment Industry Humanitarian Award dinner Thursday at the 
Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was the take: More than $1 million was raised for the non-sectarian 
organization's work in reducing prejudice and interracial tension. The second 
was the honoree: H. Wayne Huizenga, the Florida-based chairman of Blockbuster 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial support came because of strong Hollywood backing, particularly 
from companies owned by Viacom, which merged with Blockbuster and bought 
Paramount earlier this year. The honoree came because of his support for the 
NCCJ, especially its Brotherhood/Sisterhood summer camps for helping teen-agers 
overcome stereotypes and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife says we're involved with kids, critters and a couple of good 
diseases," said Huizenga. "I think the camps are a terrific program for kids. I 
think we should start them in cities all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Spelling, who co-chaired the dinner with Disney's Michael Eisner and 
CAA's Mike Ovitz, said he feels the NCCJ deserves strong support, though its 
mission isn't as clear-cut as other charities. "You can't say it cures this or 
that disease," said the producer of "Beverly Hills, 90210." "It's for 
friendship between people -- and we need that more than we need anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening began with remarks by emcee Bob Saget, an invocation by Rabbi 
Harvey Fields, a video on the NCCJ's work, and speeches by the local chapter's 
Executive Director Jim Hilvert and national President Sandy Cloud. There was a 
high-decibel performance by Patti LaBelle that tested both the sound system and 
the guests' hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster President Steve Berrard spoke of Huizenga and his work, then 
introduced the cleverest entertainment of the evening, a witty, professionally 
done video that parodied "Unsolved Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
 The theme was looking for the "real" H. Wayne Huizenga. In one scene, an actor 
portraying a restaurant owner talks of the great service Huizenga gave when he 
owned Waste Management Inc., the garbage disposal company he had before 
Blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man wasn't a trash collector, he was a showman," said the actor. "When 
he'd pick up the trash, he'd also do the death scene from 'Goodbye Mr. Chips.' 
There wasn't a dry eye in the alley." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening ended with Spelling presenting the award to Huizenga, who spoke 
with enthusiasm about the NCCJ's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 1,200 guests were Lew and Edie Wasserman, Sid and Lorraine 
Sheinberg, Sherry Lansing, Warren Littlefield, Frank Biondi, Jonathan Dolgen, 
Natalie Cole, Fred Rosen, Al Teller, Bruce McNall and Sumner Redstone, who said 
the relevance of the NCCJ is "almost perpetual. Whenever you see tension in the 
world and tension between people, the work of this organization becomes more 
important."

R S V P; IT WAS SPANISH OPERA MUSIC TO CRY FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' newest organized group of opera lovers were treated to a program 
of Spanish music so emotional some cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Hispanics for L.A. Opera were in the audience to hear Placido 
Domingo and Veronica Villarroel perform "In Concert: A Celebration of Spanish 
Music" on Thursday night at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Following two hours of zarzuela music (Spanish light opera), several encores 
and a couple of standing ovations, about 350 members drove to the Ritz-Carlton 
Huntington Hotel for a black-tie dinner in honor of Domingo that benefited the 
L.A. Opera. (Tickets were $375 and $500.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the amount of Hispanic people we have in this country and so it's 
wonderful when we are able to bring something to them," Domingo said. "It's not 
like an evening like this is available to everybody, but this eventually will 
pave the road to have good music and theater that I'm sure the Latin people 
would love to see. We have to start with this to be able to build something 
greater and bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Hispanics for L.A. Opera was begun three years ago when Alicia Garcia Clark, a 
member of the board of directors of the L.A. Opera League, wanted to reach out 
to the city's Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that Hispanic people loved music," she said. "It was just a matter of 
finding them." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Ed, did, contacting friends who in turn told their 
friends. The group currently has more than 900 members and associate members 
and is growing, with Alicia Clark as the executive chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people of different economic levels, and we try to have different 
events with various prices," she added. She credited Domingo with coming up 
with the idea for this concert, which was dedicated to his mother, the late 
zarzuela artist Pepita Embil. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gilbert Moret, one of the group's members, said, "It's not surprising 
we have so many Hispanics involved in the L.A. Opera. Opera is universal. It's 
not limited to one ethnic group or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with zarzuela. The performers tonight were just magnificent, and 
the emotion they brought to the music was so important, to the extent that it 
brought tears to my eyes, and I'm sure to the eyes of many others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting down to a late dinner that included Spanish tapas, grilled salmon and 
Cabernet-poached pears were Music Center Opera General Director Peter Hemmings 
and his wife, Jane; Domingo; Villarroel; L.A. Opera board chairman Bernard 
Greenberg and wife Lenore; board president Richard Seaver; Rose Parade float 
designer Raul Rodriguez; Chilean Consul General Ricardo Concha and his wife, 
Jeanine; Annabelle and Lorin Wilson; Dr. Jesus and Carolina Ramirez; John and 
Joan Hotchkis; Mary Lou and Andy Camacho; Lorraine and Joseph Saunders; Jose 
Nazar; Flora Thornton and Eric Small; Ryuko and Shinji Sakai; Diane and John 
Ouellet, plus Domingo's three sons and his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert and gala were sponsored by Lexus with additional underwriting by 
KMEX and Univision Television Group.

DICKENS GONE A-WRY; THEATER: DANIEL SULLIVAN'S 'INSPECTING CAROL' IN LAGUNA IS 
A SPOOF OF THE CHRISTMAS CLASSIC THAT THE PLAYWRIGHT SWEARS HE LOVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daniel Sullivan is used to the question: So what's the deal -- don't you like 
Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter precedes his practiced denial. "Oh, I love Christmas. And I love 'A 
Christmas Carol.' This is just fun, a farce." 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the nationally respected Seattle Repertory Theatre is defending a 
wry little comedy called "Inspecting Carol," which he wrote in 1991 in 
collaboration with members of his troupe. It uses a small playhouse production 
of Charles Dickens' seasonal standby as a springboard for some outrageous 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the Laguna Playhouse's staging of "Inspecting Carol" (in 
previews tonight and Wednesday, it opens Thursday), Sullivan notes that "there 
were a lot of reasons why we thought this would be ironic and why we did it, 
but one was that so many theaters use 'A Christmas Carol' as an annual 
fund-raiser. It's become this cash cow, and that makes it good to play around 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 He took his play's basic idea from Gogol's "The Inspector General," in which a 
corrupt town falls all over itself trying to bribe a clerk thought to be a 
powerful government investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sullivan's incarnation, a woeful theater troupe mistakes a very bad 
traveling actor as a representative of the National Endowment for the Arts who 
has come to evaluate the company. Eager to keep its funding, the troupe gives 
him a key role in its production of "A Christmas Carol," with terrible results. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan says his inspiration came several years ago when he was serving on an 
NEA panel that considers funding for drama groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned about a situation involving a playwright who was sent to write an 
evaluation (of a theater) that was in desperate trouble. The artistic director 
tried to bribe him by guaranteeing that one of his plays would be included in 
the theater's next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The panel was shocked by the story. I thought it was hilarious." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Christmas Carol" setting was embraced quickly by Seattle Rep's veterans, 
most of whom, Sullivan says, had at one time or another acted in both meager 
and classy stagings of the classic and welcomed the opportunity to give it a 
goosing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the whole idea of trotting out the same old sets, the same old 
characters . . . it seemed liberating to us" to tease it a bit. "We also see 
(the show) as liberating to an audience" that may be overdosing on the 
sweetness of the season and looking for something different. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy's sardonic attitude may be black (there's even a suicide at one 
point), but, Sullivan assures, it is still good-natured and respectful. He 
points to his own admiration for "A Christmas Carol," which he describes as 
nothing less than "cultural iconography." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the Nativity, there is no other story so easily understood as this 
one. All of these images (associated with Dickens' tale) are so clear that you 
don't have to explain them; they resonate with both children and adults." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Laguna Playhouse, artistic director Andrew Barnicle says 
"Inspecting Carol" is ideal because the theater tries to avoid standard 
Christmas fare. "We don't do Christmas shows, (but this play retains) some of 
the spirit of the holidays. It's very funny, simply because 'A Christmas Carol' 
is so ripe for satire." 
</P>
<P>
 * Previews of the Laguna Playhouse production of "Inspecting Carol" are 
tonight and Wednesday at 8 at the Moulton Theater, 606 Laguna Canyon Road, 
Laguna Beach. $13. The regular run starts Thursday and will continue through 
Dec. 18 (Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. with 
Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2). $17 to $22. (714) 494-8021.

THE HAMMER FALLS ON THE PUBLIC'S TRUST; COMMENTARY: UCLA/HAMMER TRUSTEES CEDED 
CONTROL OF A MAJOR CULTURAL ASSET, LEAVING THE PRIZED LEONARDO DA VINCI 
NOTEBOOK TO THE WHIM OF A PRIVATE COLLECTOR. 
</P>

<P>
 The UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center is just a few years 
old, but it has had a sorry history from the start. The tradition continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's public sale of an important manuscript by the great Italian painter, 
scientist and intellectual Leonardo da Vinci is cause for sadness and concern. 
Something significant has been lost, something worrisome gained. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum sold the 72-page notebook of scientific musings by the Renaissance 
master through Christie's New York auction house, where it brought more than 
three times the estimated sale price. The buyer was Bill Gates, the precocious 
chairman of Seattle's Microsoft Corp. and the wealthiest man in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates paid an auction record of $30.8 million -- chump change for a fellow 
whose assets are estimated by Forbes magazine at $9.2 billion, but a huge 
windfall for the cash-strapped museum. 
</P>
<P>
 What has been lost? At Friday's sale, a rare and important artifact of our 
common cultural heritage passed from the public realm into private hands. "We" 
had owned it, now "he" owns it. The public, with the Hammer museum's trustees 
acting as its agents, ceded control of a major cultural asset to a private 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Losing an irreplaceable public asset through its transfer to the private realm 
is why deaccessioning -- the practice of selling objects from museum 
collections -- is always controversial. In a museum collection, an artifact is 
common patrimony -- a source of communal inspiration, pride and intellectual 
sustenance. In a private collection, all bets are off. 
</P>
<P>
 A private collector can decide to lock the object in a vault, display it in 
his living room for the private pleasure of select friends, keep it sequestered 
from scholars or turn it into an advertising shill for the benefit of his 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 When the late Armand Hammer, the museum's notorious benefactor, bought the 
manuscript in 1980, he promptly changed its name from the Codex Leicester, by 
which it had been known worldwide since 1717. He dubbed it the Codex Hammer. 
What's next? The Codex Microsoft? 
</P>
<P>
 A Gates spokesman has said the new owner plans to display the manuscript in 
Italy for a year and send it on a worldwide tour of museums. Gates, who said he 
will not use it for business purposes, should be commended for the apparent 
goodwill of the idea and encouraged to follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's under no obligation. At the headline-grabbing Leonardo auction, 
the public gave up a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 If our loss of the Leonardo is sad, what's worrisome about the sale? 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer was not made to protect an incomparable public asset that was in 
jeopardy. Instead, it was driven by an instinct for institutional 
self-preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old museum sold the manuscript to create a reserve fund as 
"insurance" from existing or potential lawsuits against Armand Hammer's estate, 
in order that the institution could be guaranteed a future under the auspices 
of UCLA. The formal agreement between the museum and UCLA, which took over its 
operation last April, provided for this sale. It further stipulates that the 
reserve fund can be used to cover cash-flow deficits from the Hammer Museum's 
investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't fault UCLA for shielding itself from the Hammer estate's troubles, 
real or imagined. But a shield erected with money garnered from the sale of the 
collection is wholly inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaccessioning causes an irreplaceable public loss, and a public loss can only 
begin to be compensated in kind -- apples for apples, not apples for oranges. 
That's why deaccessioning is discouraged, in general, and why the code of 
ethics established by the American Assn. of Museums says -- unequivocally -- 
that income from deaccessioning can only be used for further acquisitions (or, 
secondarily, for direct care of the collection). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without the Leonardo, there's one less reason for the Hammer Museum to exist. 
For a museum with a mostly minor collection, a museum created solely to glorify 
the vanity of its founder, there is even a question of whether the institution 
is worthy of such a salvage operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA/Hammer Museum gaily ventured out onto this slippery slope. Now, the 
huge financial windfall from the record-breaking sale may send them sliding. 
Eli Broad, a trustee and spokesman for the Hammer, has said the museum's board 
will consider whether some of the unexpected income should be used to establish 
an exhibition fund or complete the still-unfinished building. That's 
intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum was right about one thing: A scientific journal is a misfit in an 
art collection. Like anything made by Leonardo, his recorded ruminations on 
water and geology do illuminate his art; however, the notebook is not itself a 
work of art. Almost all the manuscript's 300 drawings are diagrammatic 
marginalia -- engrossing little doodles by a genius, but doodles nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 The manuscript belongs in a great historical library -- say, the Huntington 
Library in San Marino, to name the most obvious nearby candidate. The 
UCLA/Hammer Museum should have transferred it there. If a hedge against 
lawsuits was needed, perhaps the deed on its goofy Westwood building could have 
been pressed into service. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late for "shoulds" and "coulds," of course. Now the obligation is to 
restrict the income from the Leonardo sale to an acquisition fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see; at $30 million, the UCLA/Hammer Museum's acquisition endowment 
would be 10 times larger than those at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and 
the Museum of Contemporary Art combined . So here's worry No. 2: Having 
squandered the public's Leonardo, what assurances have we that the museum will 
be an appropriate caretaker for future acquisitions? 
</P>
<P>
 If ours was a morally functional universe, the Leonardo manuscript would today 
still be safely ensconced in a public institution. Instead, it has been sold 
off just in case the museum needs to pay lawyers, litigants, building 
contractors and others down the road. It's an astonishing legacy.

JERRY, PAUL AND JAY ARE STAND-UP GUYS AGAIN; BENEFIT: TV'S HEAVY HITTERS OF 
COMEDY SHARE A STAGE AT A FUND-RAISER FOR A FELLOW COMIC'S FAMILY. ALL TURNED 
IN BREEZY SETS THAT SKIPPED ALONG THE SURFACE OF THEIR CATALOGUES OF MATERIAL.

 When Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Reiser, Jay Leno, Larry Miller, George Wallace, Mark 
Schiff and Dennis Wolfberg were emerging through the comedy ranks, they would 
hang out at gigs and encourage one another while they performed. All have had 
successful careers -- some, obviously, more than others -- so, when Wolfberg 
died of cancer last month, his friends decided to reunite on stage to raise 
money for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 With such heavy hitters of television and, um, literature, like Seinfeld, 
Reiser and Leno making rare local stand-up appearances Sunday at the Wiltern 
Theatre, the evening was certainly primed to play out as the Dream Team of 
comedy. But no one here was itching to run up the score and upstage anyone 
else, with all turning in breezy performances that skipped along the surfaces 
of their catalogues of material, offering a fair representation of the work 
that has made them familiar names. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why these guys all responded so favorably to one another back 
in those early days. To varying degrees, they all share the same sensibility -- 
that of the hip, slightly cynical, urban observer. They're at their best 
picking through minutiae -- finding the mild irritants of everyday life and 
rubbing at them until they produce a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno has had to retool his stand-up persona the most for TV, and his 
performance was largely a smattering of the topical gags that he's been 
delivering lately on "The Tonight Show." He opened with "I was gonna make fun 
of the Democrats, but there aren't any anymore," before riffing on such 
evergreen topics as the Northridge earthquake, Jeffrey Dahmer ("They found him 
not insane -- how many people would you have to eat to be insane?"), postal 
workers, dead Jack in the Box patrons, Charles Manson and Dr. Jack Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the author of the suicide manual "Final Exit" had written a 
sequel, Leno asked, incredulously, "Who is this for? What's the title -- 'Can't 
You Do Anything Right?'?" 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best-received sets came from Schiff, who imagined a set of 
"un-motivational tapes" dispensing such advice as "Get a bottle of whiskey and 
a pie and go back to bed," and reflected on sundry aspects of married life, 
such as when buying a new car, whether or not to get a passenger-side airbag 
for the wife ("Nah, give me a CD player"). 
</P>
<P>
 Subdued a tad due to a cold, Reiser largely sidestepped the relationship 
material that inspired his TV series, "Mad About You," and his book, 
"Couplehood," in favor of some reflections on his recent trip to Washington. 
Reiser also shared some thoughts about the discrepancy between the post 
office's regular and overnight mail system: "What they're saying is, 'For 29 
cents, sure, we're fooling around. But give us some real money, give us $10, 
and we'll guarantee it gets there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who declared himself "the only non-millionaire on stage tonight," 
riffed on the holiday season, which now includes Halloween ("We were so poor 
that for Halloween we exchanged clothes with the neighbors -- they went as us 
and we went as them"). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most cerebral of the comics, Miller made comic hay out of the 
recent decision to build Coast Guard Headquarters in West Virginia -- which, he 
pointed out, is a land-locked state. "When you're land-locked," he meticulously 
explained, "you tend not to have a 'coast.' Now, the Coast Guard is predicated, 
somewhat, on having a coast to guard. . . . And you wonder why we're not 
intercepting more drug boats?" 
</P>
<P>
 Seinfeld came on as the reigning champ, and turned his microscope onto 
pharmaceuticals: "They're all 'extra-strength' -- there's no 'strength' 
anymore. Now, there's 'maximum strength,' the maximum allowable human dosage. 
It's like saying, 'Take what will kill me, then back it off a little bit.' " He 
closed with what must have been the largest catalogue of jokes about horses 
known to the comedy world.

 No one got maudlin about Wolfberg, and only Leno shared any remembrance of the 
man, an anecdote about how he, without knowing his microphone was on, made fun 
of Wolfberg's toupee on Oprah Winfrey's show. The award for weirdest 
juxtaposition, however, goes to the evening's host, a Vegas yukster named Hiram 
Kasten, who earnestly intoned, "It is a very special night. I'm glad we could 
all be here," before launching into a creaky old groaner about a tightwad named 
Lipschitz.

THEATER REVIEWS; COMIC TOUCHES BRIGHTEN 'MIDSUMMER NIGHT'; FLIGHTS OF HUMOR, 
INTELLIGENT CUTTING AND VISUAL APPEAL MAKE CAL STATE FULLERTON'S STAGING OF THE 
SHAKESPEAREAN FANTASY A REAL PLEASURE TO WATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There are as many ways to stage Shakespeare as there are directors. His 
youthful, luminous fantasy "A Midsummer Night's Dream," particularly, is a play 
that cries out for invention and embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
 And invention -- from the lucid cutting to the flights of humor to the visual 
appeal -- is what makes Dean Hess' staging at Cal State Fullerton such a 
pleasure. "Dream" is a large play, but Hess has fitted it into the small Arena 
Theatre as though it always belonged there. 
</P>
<P>
 This may not be a production for purists, but its sense of humor and its 
greeting-card brightness provide the text with clear-cut images that stick in 
the mind. Some of the actors may not always find the rhythms of the poetry, but 
their comprehension of the emotional and comic possibilities under Hess' 
guidance are boundless. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess concentrated his cutting almost completely on the giddy young lovers and 
on the goofy Mechanicals. The fairly brief Athenian scenes are even briefer 
than usual here -- all to the good, since all they do is set up the goings-on 
in the forest. Rather standard and unexceptional performances by Christian 
Banks as Theseus, Devon Williams as Hippolyta and Tom Loeprich as Egeus don't 
come up to the free-for-all that follows. 
</P>
<P>
 The four mix-and-match young lovers don't contemporize their readings, but 
their reactions, their timing and their infectious passions find contemporary 
laughs. Todd Crabtree's opaque Lysander, Adreanna Rivoli's marvelously petulant 
Hermia, Trevor H. Olsen's blockhead of a Demetrius and Riley H. Risso's 
matter-of-fact Helena are energetic, sincere and utterly naive -- exactly the 
teen-age hormone-victims they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Purists certainly would sneer at Hess' "Rose" Bottom (Amy Schaumburg), "Anna" 
Quince (Sacha Vaughn), "Letty" Snout (Wendi West) and "Isobel" Snug (Sara 
Hess), but they would be forgetting that in Shakespeare's day, peasant women 
often did the work of men. It doesn't matter, anyway. Schaumburg's highly 
original Bottom is cleverly conceived and pretty hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're all funny, as are their underprivileged male cohorts, Kelly Merrell's 
complaisant Starveling and Blaine T. Hoffman's drag-beleaguered Flute. 
</P>
<P>
 Raylene Dodson's Titania hits all the right notes, but she's no match in this 
special context for the wood-faun sense of unreality at the core of Jeff 
Cooper's Oberon. His characterization is very simple on the surface, but a 
seemingly intuitive sense of truth-in-fantasy gives it solidity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos M. Moreno's Puck is a perfect match for this Oberon, urchin and sneak, 
the ultimate prankster found in all mythology. Moreno's readings bubble and his 
eyes dart about looking for mischief, and that is Puck. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Wight's eclectic costumes look of a period in this staging on Michael 
Tresaugue's several levels and inclines (under hanging rags for forest), and 
the action is evocatively lit by Bradley Enochs.

FAMILY; 'READER'S THEATRE PROJECT' BRING BOOKS TO LIFE DOWNTOWN

 It might seem so from all the buzz about CD-ROM and the information 
superhighway, but books aren't passe yet. To encourage children to explore 
reading for knowledge and pleasure, the Los Angeles Children's Museum is taking 
the stage with its "Reader's Theatre Project," opening today. 
</P>
<P>
 "As part of our mandate from our trustees," said project director Candace 
Barrett, "we were asked to do something about literacy, so we looked at a 
number of ways to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 "One was to feature (November) as Book and Reading Month and do activities in 
various exhibits such as book-making, illustrating and having authors read from 
their books," Barrett said. Another was to "get kids turned on to books by 
presenting them in a theatrical way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the four different shows -- "Wow!," "Really?," "Celebrate Me" and 
"Everything Counts" -- made up of four stories each, "the book remains 
central," Barrett said, "physically as well as philosophically. The book itself 
is always on stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shows are geared for preschool and early elementary, others for upper 
elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working with Scholastic (Inc.) on this," Barrett said. "They have sent 
us a great series of wonderful books, so that every child will walk out of the 
theater with a (free) book." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Reader's Theatre Project," Los Angeles Children's Museum, 310 N. Main St.,

VALLEY 187 ACTIVIST SHIFTS PASSION TO IMPLEMENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California flag hangs upside-down in Glenn Spencer's hilltop home, the 
international SOS sign and the symbol, he says, of a state with its priorities 
topsy-turvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said last week's passage of Proposition 187 has given California a 
chance to survive -- by barring illegal immigrants from most government 
services. Passage of the ballot initiative culminates two years of effort that 
began on the patio of his two-story home overlooking the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where Spencer -- alarmed by what he said was a noticeable increase in 
the number of minorities in the city -- began a grass-roots movement against 
undocumented residents, forming a group called Voice of Citizens Together. The 
group later joined with the so-called Save Our State campaign, and Spencer 
turned his home into the hub of the Proposition 187 campaign in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 His home office -- equipped with four phone lines worked by volunteers, two 
computers and modems -- has been a principal research center for issues related 
to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said Monday his group now has a new goal -- to ensure that the 
initiative is implemented. Working with Proposition 187 campaign chairman Ron 
Prince in Orange County, the group is planning a recall campaign against Los 
Angeles Board of Education members -- likely to include President Mark Slavkin 
-- because of their efforts to challenge the measure using public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer will hold a meeting Thursday at Riverside Drive Elementary School in 
Sherman Oaks to discuss recall plans and other legal strategies to stop city 
and county officials from blocking Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking out over the Valley on a sparkling morning, Spencer acknowledged that 
he has reluctantly been thrust into the public arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't enjoy this," said the 57-year-old Spencer, a semi-retired geothermal 
engineer. "If this was to go away, I'd go away. But it's got to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration, he said, cannot continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who are flooding across our borders with a very high fertility 
rate and a very low educational level," he said. "We're exporting jobs and 
importing poverty. And unless something is done, this state has nothing to face 
but fiscal havoc." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, son of a songwriter who co-created the theme to the television show 
"Gunsmoke" and grandson of a member of the singing group Sons of the Pioneers, 
said the federal government should give illegal immigrants free transportation 
and a cash bonus for returning to their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of children born in this country should be included as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials, who last week won a temporary 
injunction against Proposition 187's implementation in schools, said the 
district could lose up to $650 million in federal funds if they are forced to 
question students' legal status. Under the measure, schools would be required 
to verify the immigration status of students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they believe any recall effort will fail and Proposition 
187 ultimately will be declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, I think that people will find that upholding the Constitution is 
not something for which people should be punished," Slavkin said. "People are 
in an angry mood and are looking for targets to vent their anger." 
</P>
<P>
 A recall initiative against board members requires the signatures of 15% of 
the registered voters in the board district. Slavkin's district, for example, 
which includes a portion of the West Valley, has about 350,000 voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the signatures, Spencer said, will not be a problem due to the 
groundswell of voter support for Proposition 187. More than 60% of Valley 
voters cast their ballots in support, according to exit polls conducted by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who grew up in Hollywood and attended city schools before graduating 
from Cal State Northridge, said the school district waged a campaign against 
Proposition 187, which backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 The student walkouts over the past month and comments by board members 
opposing the initiative has turned people against the schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine -- with all these demonstrations and Mexican flags -- any 
bond issues passed in California ever again?" Spencer asked. "Public schools 
are essentially finished for all intents and purposes. The public won't finance 
them, they won't pay for them." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials denied waging a campaign on campuses but were plain in 
telling parents that Proposition 187 would hurt schools. While district 
officials say they don't know exactly how many students are in the county 
illegally, they believe the number could be about 100,000. Spencer puts the 
figure closer to 200,000, although both sides concede there is no official 
tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, the Tustin accountant who ran the Proposition 187 campaign, said 
Spencer played an important role. 
</P>
<P>
 "His research has been very significant in informing the public about the 
problem of illegal immigration," Prince said. Spencer's group was instrumental 
in gathering signatures to qualify the ballot initiative and later in 
campaigning for its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, whose wife is a school district librarian, said he has spent years 
gathering reports and compiling databases on illegal immigration. He shows a 
visitor large posters tracking the birthrates, as well as birthplaces, of women 
who have given birth in Los Angeles County during the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his interest in the subject was sparked about two years ago when he 
began noticing that an influx in minorities had flooded the city. He compiled 
research and launched a newsletter that he circulated among his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he formed Valley Citizens Together, but the group changed its name 
after residents from other parts of Los Angeles wanted to get involved. Spencer 
counts about 2,000 members but admits that not all pay the group's $15 to $25 
annual dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the passage of Proposition 187 -- which was backed by 59% of voters 
statewide -- Spencer said his phones have been ringing constantly with calls 
from people who are upset that the measure is being challenged in court. "The 
support is incredible. The phones are ringing off the hook -- even over the 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what motivates him, Spencer points to the photos of his two blond, 
blue-eyed grandchildren on the mantel in his orderly living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd like to achieve is a little better world for my grandchildren," he 
said. "I don't want my grandchildren to live in chaos. Isn't that enough?"

BALLOT COUNT TO RESUME, JUDGE RULES; ELECTION: FEINSTEIN STRETCHES HER MARGIN 
OVER HUFFINGTON AS ABSENTEE VOTES ARE TALLIED. HARMAN OVERTAKES BROOKS IN 
CONGRESSIONAL RACE AND KUYKENDALL PULLS AHEAD OF KARNETTE IN CRUCIAL ASSEMBLY 
CONTEST, BUT BOTH REMAIN TOO CLOSE TO CALL.

<P>
 Rejecting Republican charges of widespread voter fraud, a Superior Court judge 
Monday ordered absentee ballot counting resumed in Los Angeles County, as U.S. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein widened her lead over challenger Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 That action also came as a Republican pulled ahead in a crucial legislative 
race that would give the GOP control of the state Assembly for the first time 
in 25 years. And a Democratic congresswoman took her first lead in an effort to 
retain her seat representing the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert O'Brien ordered the tally of absentee ballots resumed two days 
after Republican Party activist Allen Brandstater persuaded another judge to 
temporarily halt the count, claiming that illegal immigrants, children and even 
a dog had been registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer who led the effort to halt the vote tally argued that current 
ballot counting techniques do not allow authorities to determine how fraudulent 
absentee voting affects the outcome of elections. Stephen Fleishman told 
O'Brien that information might later be needed to help the U.S. Senate 
determine the winner of the Senate contest, should the dispute reach that 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien headed off the possibility -- at least temporarily -- that the 
Senate, where the GOP will take control Jan. 1, would have any say in the close 
race between Democrat Feinstein and Republican Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien ruled in a terse order that Brandstater "failed to provide sufficient 
evidence to warrant deviating from the established statutory election process." 
But some Republicans said they might continue to press their legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's camp charged that the attack on the vote-counting procedures was 
orchestrated by Huffington out of "desperation" -- a charge denied by 
Huffington aides, despite ties between those mounting the legal challenge and 
the Huffington campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With tabulation of nearly 100,000 Los Angeles County absentee votes added to 
the statewide vote totals Monday, Feinstein had stretched her margin to 132,540 
-- nearly 9,000 votes more than on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Registrar Donald Tanney rejected only 30 of the county's 
48,000 absentee absentee ballots Monday. The ballots, which were part of 300 
ballots challenged by Huffington and Feinstein camps, had voter signatures 
missing or just were "too far from the signatures we had on file to determine 
it was the same person," Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney made his ruling with attorneys from both political camps in attendance, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These 30 ballots are not just thrown away, but locked up and kept for 22 
months," Tanney explained. "If this issue goes to court and if the court asks, 
then I can tell them my reasons for rejecting them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Huffington swept the Senate race with 59% of the vote to 32% 
for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the tally for absentee ballots is crucial. Tanney said his office 
completed signature verification of the absentee ballots, which will be counted 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we will have the 48,000 counted by Wednesday evening," Tanney 
said. "We plan to have the election declared official by next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Another 3,500 ballots, classified as "provisional" still must be counted, 
Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Provisional absentee ballots are those sent to voters who instead decide to 
vote at a polling place, he said. "We have to make sure the person doesn't vote 
twice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ballots in Los Angeles County helped reverse, for now, the election 
night result in the race for the state Assembly seat currently held by Betty 
Karnette (D-Long Beach). Her 64-vote lead was turned into a 476-vote advantage 
for challenger Steve Kuykendall, a Rancho Palos Verdes Republican, in a race 
that could help give the GOP control of the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly tabulated votes also helped push Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) 
to a narrow 260-vote lead over Republican Susan Brooks, reversing the 93-vote 
lead that Brooks had after election night. Harman's advantage came as something 
of a surprise, since she trailed the Republican challenger in absentee ballots 
that were counted on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the election results, however, were final. More than 500,000 votes 
statewide, including 120,000 from Los Angeles County, remain to be tallied. 
Election officials said they hope to have another update later this week and to 
complete all tabulation by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's lead seemed to be safe, given the trend of absentee ballots in her 
favor. Huffington would need about 62% of the remaining ballots to make up the 
difference. The two other races remained too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of all three races shifted Monday morning from the registrars' 
counting rooms around the state to O'Brien's courtroom in Downtown Los Angeles, 
where representatives of several candidates gathered to monitor the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman sought to distance the candidate from 
the court action, saying that the campaign had not directed the effort. "We are 
not the plaintiff in the case and we merely have counsel now to represent our 
interests," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater's lawyer, however, said that individuals affiliated with the 
Huffington campaign had been among those who approached him seeking to 
challenge the ballots. Another of Brandstater's attorneys works in the law firm 
advising the Huffington campaign. And Huffington's father, Roy, was present on 
Saturday, when a judge issued an order temporarily blocking the vote count. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffington campaign declined to discuss the presence of the candidate's 
father at Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart's home, where the order was 
issued. None of the other parties involved could offer an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Feinstein is pleased the judge saw through the charade of this lawsuit 
and turned it away," said Feinstein spokesman Bill Chandler. "Each passing day 
makes Sen. Feinstein more confident the results of Election Day will be 
upheld." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater is a longtime Republican activist and self-described "arch 
conservative" who is host of a radio talk show. His court papers requesting a 
halt to the vote count claimed that Democrats had been involved in widespread 
voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater had earlier complained that voter rolls had been padded with 
illegal immigrants, children and others -- complaints that were forwarded to 
the district attorney's office and became part of an ongoing criminal 
investigation. The activist had said that the standard counting technique would 
separate ballots from the voter-signed envelopes in which they were received, 
therefore destroying crucial evidence that could be used to contest the 
election later. 
</P>
<P>
 With the courts closed over the weekend, Brandstater's attorney sought out a 
Superior Court judge at home to obtain the order that temporarily halted 
tabulations. Swart was a Republican Party activist before he took the bench in 
1982 and has described himself in interviews as a close friend of Republican 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. Swart declined Monday to discuss the case or 
the presence of Huffington's father. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Brandstater's attorney argued again that it was important to 
preserve the ballots and envelopes as evidence of potential voter fraud. He 
said the materials might later be used to "bring evidence before the U.S. 
Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said that he had been presented with no evidence to prove that 
improperly registered voters had voted illegally. Under sharp questioning by 
the judge, Fleishman, the Republican attorney, conceded that he had submitted 
only one declaration that indicated an absentee vote may have been cast 
improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman in the secretary of state's office said that the court action 
was worrisome because it might have postponed final certification of the 
election beyond the Dec. 17 legal deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of question could potentially have thrown the Feinstein-Huffington 
contest into the U.S. Senate, an unusual but not unprecedented event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has no set procedure for such decisions, in which it must decide 
whether to seat a new member, refuse to seat the member or seat the member 
"without prejudice," pending an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last case, the Senate can subsequently remove a member.

CONSULTANT IN SPOTLIGHT OVER BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a conservative political consultant, Allen Brandstater has worked 
anonymously behind the scenes, advising Republicans like Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich and former Assemblyman Pat Nolan on political strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a radio talk show host in Glendale, he has not had the attention he 
received since he persuaded a judge Saturday to issue a temporary restraining 
order that stopped the tally of roughly 120,000 absentee ballots as a way to 
ferret out suspected voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The lines on his office phone buzzed almost every two minutes Monday with 
calls from the media asking for interviews. In all, he had 27 requests. "Whew! 
What a busy day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Brandstater was the man in the spotlight, the self-described "angry 
white male" who put a one-day halt to a count that could decide the fate of 
three key races, including the nation's most expensive battle between U.S. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein and challenger Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either voter fraud is a big issue or Allen Brandstater is a lot better 
looking than I thought," he joked. "I don't think it's the latter." 
</P>
<P>
 But by midafternoon Monday, Brandstater's "15 minutes of fame" faded after a 
second judge rejected his request for a preliminary injunction on the ballot 
count, saying there was not enough evidence of voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater had asked that county Registrar-Recorder Bea Valdez be required to 
keep track of the envelopes for each absentee ballot so that the votes can be 
rejected if the voters who signed the envelopes are later found to be illegally 
registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brandstater said his efforts were not affiliated with any candidate 
or party, his lawyer, Stephen Fleishman, said that associates of the Huffington 
campaign were among those who had asked Brandstater to challenge the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleishman also works for a firm that serves as Huffington's campaign 
treasurer. And Huffington's father, Roy, was present Saturday when a judge 
issued the temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater concedes that the Huffington campaign supports his effort but said 
he launched his battle against voter fraud independently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not engage in this as a Republican," he said. "I'm just angry with all 
the evidence of voter fraud that no one is doing anything about." 
</P>
<P>
 It was through his radio show on KIEV 870 AM that he began to hear of voter 
fraud in Glendale, making him suspect wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater won the first round of his battle when Superior Court Judge 
Coleman Swart issued a temporary restraining order Saturday night, instructing 
Valdez to keep track of the envelopes. Valdez stopped the count, saying a 
system to track the envelopes would be too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a hearing Monday, Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien reversed the 
decision.

DISNEY TO ORGANIZE MARATHON, 5K RUN; RUNNING: ANAHEIM RACES IN MARCH, 1995, 
WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH LOS ANGELES MARATHON, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 At first glance, it was enough to make Bill Burke blanch. Disney was getting 
into the marathon business in Orange County, and that probably meant big money 
-- the kind Burke, president of the Los Angeles Marathon, could not match. 
</P>
<P>
 That could send elite runners, those who put marathons on the running map, to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 So they talked and reached an accord of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the first Disneyland Marathon and 5K run will be announced. The 
Los Angeles Marathon will be represented at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The key with Disney is the 5,000-meter run. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be coupled with the Disneyland Marathon on March 26, 1995, three weeks 
after the Los Angeles Marathon, but the two, said Disney spokesman Joe Aguirre, 
are not in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 More or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in touch with officials of the Los Angeles Marathon and we're 
going to be offering an arrangement whereby people can run both races at a 
reduced price," Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elite runners frequently compete only twice a year, and never so close 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said Monday he had received a letter of agreement to that effect and 
that there was an additional stipulation that Disney would run 5,000-meter and 
10,000-meter races and a half-marathon in 1996, with marathon runners then 
bused to Los Angeles to compete in his race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could give Southern California the biggest running weekend in the world," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's races in 1995 will offer an unusual purse split, with $31,000 going 
to the 5,000-meter field and $19,000 to the marathoners. No appearance money 
for elite runners will be offered, said Aguirre, and the marathon, held to 
promote tourism in conjunction with Disneyland's 40th anniversary, might be a 
one-shot deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter races would be on-going, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Marathon will offer about $500,000 in appearance and prize 
money for its 10th race, March 5, 1995, and Burke said that world-class runners 
Arturo Barrios, Mark Plaatjes, Bob Kempainen, Martin Pitayo and Rolando Vera 
had been contracted to run. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was in contact with Olga Appell, who won in Los Angeles last 
year, to defend her title. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre said Disney had been in contact with runners in Japan and Mexico to 
run in its race, with a special emphasis on the Japanese. The two races will 
limit fields to 10,000 runners, with 1,500 of the spots offered to 
international competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 DisneyWorld, the company's Florida operation, runs its own marathon, on a 
larger scale. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mansoor, with USA Track and Field and the director of the San Francisco 
Marathon, has been contracted to direct the Disney races. The 5,000-meter event 
will be run on Disneyland property, with the marathon course -- which has yet 
to be determined -- winding through the city of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the Disneyland and Los Angeles marathons will be evaluated after 
this year and next, said Burke, and if the marriage is not satisfactory, the 
two entities will go their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Marathon has had Mercedes Benz as its primary sponsor for its 
entire run, but the contract runs out after the 1995 race and Mercedes has 
indicated that it will not renew, Burke said. However, other automobile 
sponsors could become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disneyland Marathon would be the first here since Nov. 3, 1991, the last 
Orange County Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was plagued by organizational problems and poor promotion. Although 
organizers said the race attracted 4,000 entrants and 150,000 spectators, 
observers said both numbers seemed grossly inflated. Orange County Marathon 
Inc. struggled for months afterward to pay its bills -- including off-duty 
police fees, vendors and competitor prize money -- resulting in court actions. 
</P>
<P>
 A sequel was scheduled for Nov. 8, 1992, but never came off.

NEWBERRY HELPS KEEP TENUOUS HOLD ON LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Ram offensive lineman Tom Newberry was one of the regular, everyday 
working-stiffs, he probably would have been ready to quit by now. 
</P>
<P>
 Try working nine years for a company, then getting demoted in favor of some 
guy with a tattoo on his ankle, all the while worrying that you're going to be 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Newberry ready for a career change back in training camp? Not quite 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Newberry has kept his job, regained a starting position he lost in camp and 
tried to hold together a struggling, injury-riddled offensive line that 
includes rookie Wayne Gandy and second-year player Chuck Belin. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as young a group as I've played with since I've been here," said 
Newberry, a second-round draft pick of the Rams in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the league nine years, and there always has been some eight- or 
10-year veterans, a couple five-year guys and a second-year guy. But now 
there's a four-year guy, a three, a two and a rookie. " 
</P>
<P>
 That young offensive line, and the players trying to operate behind it, have 
taken some serious lumps this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Jerome Bettis, who was held to a career-low 13 yards in 10 carries, 
or quarterback Chris Chandler, twice carried off the field because of ankle 
injuries after getting buried by pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Or ask quarterback Chris Miller, who was knocked out of the San Francisco game 
with sore ribs and a concussion against New Orleans, both a result of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an awful situation up front -- one that would be much worse if not for 
the consistent play of Newberry, a player the Rams were prepared to put out to 
pasture last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Rams play Newberry not so much because they want to. They have to. 
</P>
<P>
 When Keith Loneker, who took Newberry's starting left guard spot, went down 
with a fallen arch in the third game of the season, Newberry was there to 
replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 When center Bern Brostek broke a bone in his right leg in the third quarter of 
the Green Bay game, Newberry moved over to take his spot and groomed Belin as 
the starting left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "His presence in the huddle has been the key," Belin said. "Since Bern has 
been down, the whole offensive line has counted on Tom for getting to the right 
people on blocks. We have to know our individual assignments too, but Tom is 
there to help reassure us that we're doing it right." 
</P>
<P>
 When offensive line coach Jim Erkenbeck was knocked unconscious when a New 
Orleans player accidentally ran into him on the sideline, Newberry and 19-year 
veteran Jackie Slater helped with the coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom is the leader, the coach on the field, the hustler, and does everything 
that is required of him," Erkenbeck said. "He's the most pleasant surprise I've 
had in coaching for a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
 But how much longer will Newberry play? 
</P>
<P>
 Newberry, 32, admits he's no Slater, and he is mulling retirement after this 
three-year contract expires at the end of the season. Being an unrestricted 
free agent, would he try to extend his career another year or two? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll talk to Erkenbeck after the season's over," Newberry said. "That's next 
year's problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But last summer, the Rams were ready to drum him out of football a year early. 
Newberry is 6 feet 2 and 287 pounds -- small by offensive lineman standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Newberry was sweating it out until the final cuts, but found job security 
because of his guaranteed salary, a rarity among NFL players. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the guaranteed money, the Rams figured it was best to pay him to 
play on Sundays rather than watch games with a remote control in one hand and a 
chilly one in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The guaranteed money also would have counted under the team's $34.6-million 
salary cap, so the Rams figured why not keep a veteran around for another 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Newberry was coming off a knee injury that sidelined him the final seven games 
of the 1993 season. It was the first injury of his pro career that forced him 
to miss more than one game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different for me," Newberry said. "I was uncomfortable on the 
sidelines and not being able to go in and do something. I had a good 
off-season, and I came back this season feeling better than I had the year 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Rams demoted Newberry, a two-time Pro Bowl selection who once had a 
streak of 73 consecutive starts. Thanks, the coaches told him, but we are going 
with Loneker, a 6-3, 330-pound bowling ball with legs who had made the team as 
a rookie free agent the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't worry about it," Newberry said, shrugging. "All I could do was get 
ready for the season and come in and do the best I could. I don't have any 
impact on those things, those are coaching decisions. I do my job. 
</P>
<P>
 Erkenbeck said Newberry handled the demotion "a lot better than I did." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really frustrated because I didn't know how to go about making a change 
that I thought was necessary," Erkenbeck said. "I was concerned that I might be 
making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom just settled in and said he would do whatever I asked him to." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three months after training camp broke, Newberry is helping develop an 
offensive line with disaster-area potential. But Newberry's calm, business-like 
approach gives the line some stability -- on the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night before a game, Newberry rounds up the offensive line for a 
players-only meeting, offering the younger players a chance to ask questions 
and clear up any confusion about their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I run off some extra front sheets and try to help them out if they have any 
problems," Newberry said. "I tell them to call me, even at night. By the time 
we get to Sunday, we've watched enough film that everyone is really 
well-prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of the young guys, there's nights where they sit there looking at (a 
diagram) and it doesn't make any sense. Sometimes, things don't make sense when 
you don't have the experience."

THREE CLOSE LOSSES HAVE BEEN GNAWING AWAY AT RAMS' MORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have lost four of their last six games by a combined 16 points, and 
free safety Anthony Newman is taking the frustration of the close losses home 
with him after games. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, a defensive captain, turned his back to the field when the offense was 
playing last year because because he couldn't bear to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday night, Newman couldn't even watch the game highlights on TV after 
the Rams' 20-17 loss to the Raiders at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with highlights -- or lowlights -- like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Jerome Bettis getting buried by the Raider defensive line, gaining 
a career-low 13 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Starting quarterback Chris Chandler spraining his left ankle in the second 
quarter when Raider defensive tackle Chester McGlockton busted through the 
Rams' revolving-door offensive line and sacked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to turn it off and watch some cartoon or something," Newman said. "I 
watched 'Fantasia' last night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get my mind off it because when you start thinking, 'Oh, we lost by 
three points,' you will drive yourself . . . It's different if you're getting 
beat by 30 or 40 points. But we've lost three games where it could have gone 
either way." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-point losses to the Raiders, New Orleans (37-34) and Atlanta (8-5) 
leave the Rams 4-6 and with fading playoff hopes entering Sunday's showdown 
with NFC West rival San Francisco at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Bettis be able to run on the 49ers after getting shut down by the 
Raiders? Will Chandler even be able to play with the sprained left ankle? Will 
the struggling offensive line -- playing without injured starters Jackie 
Slater, Bern Brostek and Leo Goeas -- be able to protect Chandler or his 
backup, Chris Miller? 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who set a goal of 2,000 rushing yards this season, failed to gain 100 
yards for the fifth-consecutive game and is quickly losing ground in the NFL 
rushing race. He's sixth in the league in rushing with 827 yards in 243 carries 
(3.4-yard average) and trails league-leader Barry Sanders of Detroit by 492 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rough," Bettis said. "There's not a whole lot of positives. We got beat 
up front, and that's the bottom line. We couldn't find anywhere to run, so we 
had to abort the running game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, considering that our game plan is built around running and 
then we can't run the ball in a critical game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were set on stuffing Bettis, but Chandler exposed the soft 
underbelly of the strategy by throwing deep to Flipper Anderson in the first 
quarter, including a 22-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they sell out and bring everyone up to stop Jerome, you'll get some 
sizable yardage throwing downfield," Chandler said. "They wanted to stop the 
run, but shoot, we'll throw for 100 yards a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we need to throw more to open it up for Jerome." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler was doing just that -- completing 10 of 11 passes for 171 yards and a 
touchdown -- until getting hurt on McGlockton's sack in the second quarter. 
Once Chandler was out, Bettis wasn't a factor and Miller was forced to pass on 
21 consecutive plays at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox said he couldn't remember a team shutting down one of his 
team's running attacks as well as the Raiders did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just weren't able to get some things tied together like we needed to, and 
there wasn't a whole lot of places to run," Knox said. "I saw that early, and 
that's why we decided our best chance to win was to throw the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of a running game allowed them (Raiders) to tee off and put a lot of 
pressure on Miller." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems running the football can be traced to a beat-up offensive line 
that has resorted to inexperienced players -- rookie tackle Wayne Gandy and 
second-year guard Chuck Belin, as well as third-year tackle Darryl Ashmore, who 
has moved to right guard to replace an injured Goeas the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of the ability to run the football is the fact that we have four new 
starters in there," Knox said. "We're on our third starter at left guard -- Tom 
Newberry, Keith Loneker and now Belin." 
</P>
<P>
 The running game also has suffered from the absence of tight end Pat Carter 
and fullback Tim Lester. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams didn't re-sign Carter in the off-season, and Lester, who has only one 
carry for minus-one yard for the season, was bumped from the starting lineup by 
Howard Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a change there because Griffith is a better pass receiver," Knox 
said. "Lester was active for (Sunday's) game and will play." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bettis averaged 8.8 yards per carry on sweep plays because of key 
blocking from Lester and Carter. This year, he's averaging 3.4 yards per carry 
behind the blocking of Griffith and tight end Troy Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis took a politically correct stance Monday on the benching of Lester. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a coaching decision," he said. "I could bitch and moan, but I don't 
think it's going to change a lot as far as the decision-making process. It will 
only make some players disgruntled. You just have to take it with a grain of 
salt and encourage Timmy." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Bettis miss Carter's blocking? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose a blocker like him, you're definitely going to suffer," he 
said. "But Troy is coming on strong and he's filling the void." 
</P>
<P>
 * COMMITMENT TO BRAWLS 
</P>
<P>
 Violence is typical wherever Raiders play, authorities said in wake of 
Sunday's arrests.

 Moorpark College forward Nick Foster, a Thousand Oaks High graduate, has 
signed a letter of intent to play basketball at Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick (6-foot-9) will be playing in the Big West Conference against his twin 
brother and current teammate, Paul, who signed last week with UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick is a great passer and shoots very well," Pacific Coach Bob Thomason said 
Monday. "He also runs the floor well for a big man and will help us at the 
power forward position." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick and Paul starred for Thousand Oaks High, then briefly attended the Air 
Force Academy last fall. They returned to Southern California last season, Paul 
playing at Moorpark and Nick redshirting at Ventura. Nick transferred to 
Moorpark this season.

 Five Hueneme High football players were suspended from school for their roles 
in a brawl following last Thursday's home game against Dos Pueblos, Hueneme 
Coach Larry Miller said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspended for five days were junior quarterback George Jones and junior 
lineman Zwall Lee.Senior lineman Guillermo Lopez, junior cornerback Jermaine 
Johnson and linebacker Vainuku Soloway were each suspended indefinitely and 
recommended for expulsion with the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the punishments were decided Monday morning after he met with 
Principal Joanne Black, Vice Principal John Saunders and Athletic Director Jim 
Lane. The five-day suspensions began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one or two minutes of fighting (the players) disappointed a lot of people 
who have done a lot for this program," Miller said. "This isn't the streets and 
we've got to send a message that this isn't the way to behave." 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl began in a handshake line when a Dos Pueblos player taunted Hueneme 
players over Dos Pueblos' 35-28 win, Miller said. He added that all the 
suspended players were disciplined for their roles in the melee, except 
Soloway, who was in the locker room at the time. Miller said Soloway was 
punished for striking a teammate on the sidelines late in the game and then 
attempting to strike Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Williams, a Hueneme student who is not on the football team, received a 
five-day suspension for coming out of the stands to join the fight. TRIS WYKES

 Cal State Fullerton, which battled to the NCAA men's soccer final four last 
year, Monday received an at-large berth in this season's playoffs and will play 
host to the University of San Diego in a first-round game at 7 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Al Mistri was delighted his team will be at home after 
agonizing earlier in the day about whether the Titans would be invited at all 
with a 12-6-2 record. Fullerton, however, was ranked No. 14 nationally and had 
upset top-ranked Indiana in a tournament at UCLA three weeks ago. Mistri had 
been concerned it would be a close call for the selection committee between his 
team and San Diego (13-5) if only four teams from the West Region were invited. 
But both were among five West Coast teams making the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It will mark the first time Fullerton has played host to a men's NCAA Division 
I playoff event. The school has been the site for NCAA women's basketball and 
softball playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (17-2-1) claimed the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation's 
automatic berth by beating UCLA last weekend and will meet San Francisco 
(9-6-3) in a first-round game Sunday at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (15-4) was the other California team invited. The Bruins also will be the 
home team for their first-round game against Alabama Birmingham (15-3-1). UCLA, 
however, will be in a different bracket from the other four California teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of the Fullerton-San Diego and Fresno State-San Francisco games 
will meet in the second round a week later at an undetermined site.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited to be in the playoffs again, and very excited to be having 
a first-round game at home," Mistri said. "We feel that is a very significant 
thing for our program." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's selection marks its fourth appearance in the NCAA playoffs. The 
Titans were invited to the playoffs in 1975 and 1986 before last season, when 
Fullerton won NCAA playoff games against Fresno State, San Diego and San 
Francisco to advance to the final four at Davidson, N.C. The Titans were beaten 
by South Carolina, 1-0, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego is going to be after us this time after we beat them in the 
playoffs last season," Mistri said. "I'm sure both teams will be looking 
forward to another rematch." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, San Diego beat the Titans, 2-1, in overtime in the regular season, 
but Fullerton came back to win in the second round of the playoffs, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really had a good rivalry," Mistri said, "and San Diego's coach (Seamus 
McFadden) has been a good friend." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego has won its last seven games.

OWEN TELLS ANGELS HE WANTS TO BE TRADED; BASEBALL: THIRD BASEMAN, WHO HIT 
CAREER-HIGH .310 LAST SEASON, SAID HE WILL STAY ONLY IF HE STARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel starting third baseman Spike Owen, who batted a career-high .310 last 
season, has asked to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen told the Angels he's interested in staying only if he remains in the 
starting lineup, but Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said that won't happen. 
Instead, Eduardo Perez will be given the starting third-base job, Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them that I don't want to come back and be a backup player," Owen 
said, "because I'm better than that. I deserve a chance to play. And I proved 
that this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I've asked them to move me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi began informing teams at the Major League general manager meetings 
Monday that Owen was available for trades, and said he'll make every attempt to 
honor Owen's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to play," Bavasi said, "and I understand that. But we're committed 
to Eduardo Perez. He's going to camp as our third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we'll do everything we can to accommodate Owen, but we're not going to 
give him away." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, who was traded a year ago from the New York Yankees, emerged last season 
as one of the Angels' most pleasant surprises. Although he never had played 
anything other than shortstop in his career, Owen became the starting third 
baseman May 26. He responded by batting .323 the rest of the season, and led 
the American League with a .454 batting average with runners in scoring 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers, who previously attempted to acquire Owen before he signed a 
three-year, $7-million contract with the Yankees, might be interested in 
acquiring Owen as their everyday shortstop. Although Owen is scheduled to earn 
$3.25 million in 1995, the Yankees are responsible for $2.75 million of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be a blessing," Owen said, "because someone won't have to pay 
my full salary. I can thank the Angels for showing people I can play again, and 
the Yankees for picking up the salary. Hopefully, that will open some people's 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen's preference is to become a shortstop again, and with his home in Austin, 
Tex., the Rangers or Houston Astros would be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the Angels are not obligated to do anything," Owen said, "but 
hopefully they'll have enough respect for me to place me where I have a chance 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoyed playing for the Angels, but I'm just not going back there as 
an insurance policy. They understand that. But I also deserve a chance to 
play." Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Padres informed the Angels on Monday that they might have an 
interest in trading for center fielder Chad Curtis, and would be willing to 
deal pitching in return. . . . Dodger General Manager Fred Claire has been 
advised by scouts in the Arizona Fall League that minor league third baseman 
Ron Coomer is not ready to be an everyday player because of his defensive 
lapses. Yet, Claire said he has not given up on the possibility of Coomer 
becoming their opening-day third baseman. If Coomer is not ready, the Dodgers 
will attempt to re-sign Tim Wallach, who also is being courted by the Padres. . 
. . John Franco, considered the most attractive free-agent closer on the 
market, has yet to draw interest from the Angels or Dodgers. He is being sought 
by the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians and New York Mets. 
. . . Cub General Manager Ed Lynch said he will soon telephone former Cub 
second baseman Ryne Sandberg but refused to say whether he will try to persuade 
him to end his retirement. . . . The Philadelphia Phillies are negotiating to 
sign free-agent third baseman Terry Pendleton. . . . The Colorado Rockies, 
desperate for pitching, are attempting to sign free-agent starters Danny 
Jackson and Billy Swift. . . . General managers were told for the second 
consecutive year that they will not be participating in the baseball winter 
meetings.

A WINNING ATTITUDE; LOS ALAMITOS' STREAK MEAN THE GRIFFINS DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S 
LIKE TO BE LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an innocent question. A just-wondering-type of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Alamitos High cheerleader approached the pep squad adviser and asked: 
"Mrs. Trujillo, what do we do when we lose a football game?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't her fault, she had just never seen it happen," Judy Trujillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, even Trujillo had to think. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her, we go out on the field and congratulate our players and the other 
team," she said. "We don't cry or sob. When we go home, we hit our heads on the 
wall. But not at the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long time between headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors have to dig deep into memories, back to those lowly freshman days. 
Juniors have yet to see one. Sophomores have only heard wild rumors that, 
indeed, the Griffins once lost a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 45 games without a loss, a high school lifetime. The school, 
community and, yes, even the players and coaches are quite aware of that. It 
would be impossible to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect has been positive and, at times, even a little silly.  
</P>
<P>
 Students are tuned in, fixated even, on events before, during and after each 
game. It transcends cliques. Yup, the metal-heads, skateboarders and surfers 
are on top of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 People around town are keenly interested in the team. How are they doing? Who 
are they playing? How big will we win? Fans trickle in 1-1 1/2 hours before 
game time to get a good seat. And that's not only the players' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the local airwaves are a buzz. Coach John Barnes has a show on local 
cable. It's on several times a week, first live, then on tape. It's Los 
Alamitos Television's most-watched production, more popular than even the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's more difficult than finding a Los Alamitos student who can remember 
the last defeat? Finding one who can't rattle off how many times the team has 
won since. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't walk across campus without people telling you about the streak," 
wide receiver/defensive back Brad Melsby said. "On game day, I leave my house 
and drive up Los Alamitos Boulevard. All the way up, there are signs for the 
team. It's become a big event this year. When the streak is over, we know there 
will never be anything like it again." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't hold your breath. Neither the Griffins nor their fans are ready to 
call it a quits, not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Said cheerleader McKenzie Commeau: "Every week, kids are asking, 'Is this game 
going to be 56-0? Or is it going to be close, like 43-30?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A streak has become The Streak this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Activities Director Jerry Halpin: "I went down to get a newspaper on a 
Saturday and overheard these guys in a barbershop. They were talking Los 
Alamitos football." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but who isn't? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos has always drawn well at football games, but the base has 
expanded the last three years. Approximately 10,000 turned out when the 
Griffins played host to Esperanza this season. And more than half were from Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more than parental duty and student fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighbors come to every game and none of them has a kid on the team," 
said Diane Atwood, who had one son on the team last season and another on it 
this season. "The community is wrapped up with this team. People who aren't 
connected with the school come to games." 
</P>
<P>
 And people who are connected get very involved. About 30 players' parents went 
to see Esperanza play Huntington Beach this season, just to check out the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone is feeling Griffin pride," Principal Carol Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart is feeling that pinch a little more than some. 
</P>
<P>
 She is fined for each Griffin victory by the local Rotary Club, whose meetings 
she attends every week. The Griffins went 14-0 last season and Hart had to dig 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team cost me a small fortune last year," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth it. Morale on the campus has never been higher, according to Hart. 
Student attendance at games has soared. Halpin estimated more than 1,100 
students showed up for the Esperanza game, nearly half the student body. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sold 70 ASB cards five games into the season, once everyone discovered 
that a discount to all Sunset League games came with it. 
</P>
<P>
 And just try to find a newspaper the day after a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have one by 7 a.m., forget it," Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Commeau: "Everyone buys a paper and shows the game story to the players. 
It's a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 So big that a new on-campus club was formed: "Griffin Chicks of '96." As 
politically incorrect as it sounds, it was a group of junior girls who came up 
with the name. They even had sweat shirts made. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the ones responsible for the posters along Los Alamitos Boulevard. 
They get up at 5 a.m. on game days to get the message out. 
</P>
<P>
 Their purpose? To give support to the school's large, extensively 
choreographed cheerleading squad, improve student support at games and, oh yes, 
to yell. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually yelling is at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're loud and we have lots of friends,' said Allie Hart, one of the group's 
leaders. "We had a spirit club before, but we decided it wasn't doing the job. 
Now we have people to sit with us and yell. We even tell the cheerleader what 
cheers to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Their work is bipartisan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, the skateboard guys and surfers are into the team," Allie Hart said. 
"Everyone is into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes learned that a few weeks ago, when he was tapped on the shoulder after 
leaving his office the afternoon of the Esperanza game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was this kid who looked like he was into heavy metal pretty good," Barnes 
said. "He seemed like the most unlikely football fan I had ever seen. But he 
said, 'Good luck Coach, go get them.' He was really sincere. I thought, 'This 
kid really cares about us winning tonight.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Winning has a lot to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 One more victory, in fact, ties the Southern Section undefeated streak record. 
That would come Friday in the Division I first-round game against Bellflower 
St. John Bosco. Temple City (1969-73) and Canyon Country Canyon (1983-86) both 
won 46 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins also have a 24-game winning streak, dating back to a 14-14 tie 
with Esperanza in the 1992 Division II title game. The Griffins haven't lost 
since Oct. 25, 1991, a 28-7 drubbing by Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The national undefeated streak is still off in the distance. Shelbyville 
(Tenn.) Bedford County Training went 78-0-4 from 1943-50. The Griffins aren't 
even in the top 10 nationally. But they're getting there and everyone, it 
seems, is counting. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week a poster on Los Alamitos Boulevard gives the latest number. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has the Energizer Bunny on it and reads, 'It keeps going and going and 
going,' " Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make a guy cringe. What coach would want that body count on 
public display? 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said has avoided talking about the streak. He wants the team to focus 
on that traditional one-game-at-a-time philosophy, and his players are happy to 
oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 "The streak is not something we think about a lot," Melsby said. "It's a 
product of our hard work. We just play the games, we don't look back on how 
many we've won." 
</P>
<P>
 But others do. 
</P>
<P>
 The time had come to address the matter last week, when Barnes entered the 
cafeteria for the pregame meal and saw a computer printout of every victory. It 
started on the wall and stretched onto the middle of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "A parent had made it and it was very impressive, with 1 1/2-inch letters and 
everything," Barnes said. "I told everyone that the streak was really special 
and was something for our players to remember when they are older. But it was 
not the reason we played the game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins' purpose, though, is divulged every Saturday afternoon on 
"Griffin Football With Coach John Barnes." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes has been doing the cable show for five years, but he took over as host 
this season. David C. Smith, its first-year producer, said the program is the 
station's most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes brings on two players each week. He talks about the last game, 
questions the players on their performance and then closes with the upcoming 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 No script, just Barnes waxing poetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach is really good at that," Melsby said. "He likes talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Davis: "We call John, 'The Human Stopwatch.' We don't give him any time 
cues, but every week he's within a minute of the half-hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes asked to have the show cut back from an hour before the start of the 
season, because it was taking up too much coaching and family time. That 
brought some concern from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had more callers asking whether we're going to have that show than we did 
on whether we were going to show the games," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, they may be calling, but just try to find someone to admit they watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Commeau: "Never seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trujillo: "We have pep squad practice on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Atwood: "I read, I don't watch television." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the only thing that has people pleading ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin football games are a production, complete with a deafening sound 
system. The pep squad even hauls it to some away games. Still, no one has the 
guts to take credit for some of the musical selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, choruses of "Whoomp, there it is" had numbed fans by season's 
end. It was played after every Griffin touchdown. Los Alamitos scored 585 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Village People's "YMCA" is a big hit. It drives the crowd -- 
including parents -- into a frenzy. But no one will fess up. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Commeau: "Someone else makes the tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Melsby: "The players aren't involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barnes: "I have nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's Barnes," Trujillo said. "He approves everything. We had other music 
on there and he grumbled some. We changed it and he said, 'Well, glad you 
finally got rid of that dance music.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Halpin: "Actually, after listening to rap, disco starts to sound pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for true entertainment, Griffin fans need merely watch their team. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' spread formation, with four wide receivers, and shoot-and-shoot 
offense brings oooohs and aaaahs . They score lots of points and can score them 
in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were a grind-it-out, wing-T team, I don't think we would draw as many 
fans," Halpin said. "We're fun to watch. I think that's why more and more 
people have come out this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is the Griffins have been tested more in recent weeks than they 
were all of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the field, there was the question of an ineligible player, a charge made 
by another school. It could have cost the team nine victories and brought a 
pro-rated end to the streak at 36. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the school proved the player was eligible and everyone 
exhaled, even many opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wanted to see them lose the streak that way," Esperanza Coach Gary 
Meek said. "When they lose it, it should be on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 That, too, has almost happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison had a 12-7 lead with 38 seconds left three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was crying," Atwood said. "My youngest son had tears in his eyes, 
and my oldest son said, 'The end of a dynasty.' I just had my fingers crossed 
and was praying." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Kevin Feterik took the Griffins 48 yards in two plays. He threw a 
15-yard touchdown pass to Tony Hartley with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Feterik took the Griffins 83 yards in the final two minutes and 
threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Stan Guyness for a 35-32 victory over 
Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never doubted," Commeau said. "I know Kevin and all those guys. I knew they 
would pull it together. I knew we would win." 
</P>
<P>
 They had to, or Commeau and the other cheerleaders might not have known what 
to do afterward.

MATER DEI IS ERASING THE MEMORIES OF 56-3; THIS TIME, MONARCHS SAY TRIP TO 
FINAL WON'T BE ENOUGH TO SATISFY THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven months' time and 10 convincing victories have helped erase the painful 
memories of Mater Dei's embarrassing 56-3 defeat to Rialto Eisenhower in last 
year's Division I title game. But for John Flynn, some memories don't easily 
fade away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget walking into the locker room after it was over and seeing 
the look in the seniors' eyes," Flynn said. "I couldn't think of the pain they 
were feeling because I knew I had one year left. But I knew it was something 
they'd have to live with and that it was going to be in their hearts forever." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's group of seniors haven't mentioned the numbers 56-3 much, but when 
they do, Flynn said, it's usually for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're going through the motions during weightlifting or we've had a bad 
practice, it always comes up," Flynn said. "It stirs up the memories for the 
seniors. All the rest of them don't really understand how devastating it really 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Monarchs, ranked second in Orange County, devastate their playoff 
opponents the way they've devastated their regular-season foes, next's year 
group of seniors won't have any bitter memories to erase. In going through the 
regular season undefeated, Mater Dei has piled up 375 points to 115 for its 
opponents. Its closest game was against third-ranked Esperanza, which it beat, 
38-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's team lost to Esperanza, 33-7, in the regular season and won two of 
its games by 10 points or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn acknowledged that the 1993 team was fortunate to reach the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won our three playoff games by a total of 10 points," he said. "Against 
St. Paul (in the first round), we were losing until I threw a long ball to 
Michael-John Rzeznik that he caught on his fingertips. Another inch, and our 
season is over. Long Beach Poly (in the quarterfinals) had us tied except they 
had a field goal called back because of a penalty. We were living right for 
three weeks and a kickoff." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior tackle Matt Motherway said the team felt it could no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believed we were the team of destiny," Motherway said. "We kind of thought 
we'd have the storybook ending, and we figured nobody could beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior fullback Joey Trampush, who has rushed for 540 yards and averaged 7.4 
yards a carry this season, said he believed the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funny thing is, going into the Eisenhower game, I thought there was no 
doubt we were going to win," he said. "I mean no doubt. And even coming in at 
halftime down 35-3, when Coach (Bruce Rollinson) wrote '38-35' on the 
blackboard, I really thought that was going to happen. I finally realized it 
wasn't going to happen when they scored to open the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinson, who was suffering from the flu, remembers simply trying to survive 
the game. At one point, Rollinson became so violently ill, he left the field 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hanging on for dear life," he said. "I knew I had to get to the 
bathroom. Everybody thought I was having a heart attack because nobody thought 
I would walk off the field. By that time I was pretty numb to what was 
happening. When they told me, Eisenhower had scored again, I said, 'It 
figures.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt real bad for the seniors. That was a helpless feeling. I couldn't put 
my fingers in all the holes fast enough. I don't know that even if we'd have 
played our best game if the result would have been any different." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he realizes last year's team had many shortcomings, and he might 
have been the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get the big play this year, but last year we couldn't because my arm 
wasn't too strong," he said. "I wouldn't throw more than 15 to 19 yards 
downfield. I had an average arm. I knew it and the coaches knew it. So I worked 
out in the off-season with weights and the receivers. I added about 10-15 yards 
of distance and increased my velocity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against Eisenhower, receivers would be open, but I'd throw rainbows and the 
defensive backs would be there by the time the ball arrived. It was like a 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is laughing at Flynn this year. He has thrown for 2,070 yards and 
21 touchdowns, completed 67.1% of his passes with only three interceptions, and 
he has given defenses more to think about than simply Trampush and tailback 
Steve Bodnar (1,352 yards, 22 touchdowns). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hard to stop this year because we can do so much," Trampush said. "A 
perfect example is against (Capistrano Valley): Steve and I only rushed for 
about 70 yards, but John threw three touchdown passes and we still won, 31-3." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his team's offensive diversity, Rollinson said he is more confident 
entering the playoffs than he was last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little more difficult to prepare for, especially offensively," he 
said. "Sooner or later, one of our weapons is going to hurt you. I like the 
balance we have between running and passing. And our defense is playing a lot 
better than it did last year. They've improved every week." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four weeks, Mater Dei's defense has only given up 30 points in 
victories over South Coast League opponents San Clemente, Capistrano Valley, 
Mission Viejo and Dana Hills. But Rollinson realizes those numbers are somewhat 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difficulty we have this year is the South Coast League isn't as tough 
this year, so it's going to be hard for us to take it up a couple levels once 
we get to the playoffs, especially in the span of 48 minutes," he said. "But I 
can see this group doing that. Last year's team was an overachieving group, but 
this year's team has continued to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this group in that there's a little bit of a tough guy in them, a 
little bit of cockiness. They will spend the time necessary to get the job 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said his teammates haven't spent all the extra time just so they can 
reach the final again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of last year's team was satisfied just to get there," he said. "We did a 
lot more than people picked us to. But this year, we're winning by more and we 
feel better about ourselves. This year, we're looking to win it." 
</P>
<P>
 And also erase the numbers 56-3 from their memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't lie to you," Rollinson said. "The only way you can right what 
happened last year is by winning the championship. Getting there won't do it."

NEWPORT HARBOR'S WAVE IS FINALLY PEAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While most of Orange County clamored over who's No. 1 -- Los Alamitos or Mater 
Dei -- Newport Harbor quietly made history. 
</P>
<P>
 After piling up victories, one by one, Newport Harbor finished with a 35-14 
triumph over El Toro Thursday to cap a 10-0 season, the best regular-season 
record in the school's 64 years of playing varsity football. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors finished ranked No. 1 in Southern Section Division V and fourth in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jeff Brinkley couldn't pinpoint one reason for the team's 
record-breaking success, but he had a fistful of potential causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took over eight years ago, there was definitely a game plan," Brinkley 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 He began implementing his plan, piece by piece. And in his ninth season, 
everything fell into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the biggest pieces: 
</P>
<P>
 * A hard-working, talented coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the best weight-training facilities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * Top-notch technology for the film and stat crews. 
</P>
<P>
 * And most importantly, 38 varsity players who believe in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletic-wise, a lot of teams are superior to us," said John Giordani, 
Newport Harbor's starting quarterback. "But we have the team camaraderie that 
sets us apart from the other teams that, talent-wise, we might not match up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no star player here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailor running game is led by a tailback committee of Brian Johnson, Edon 
Kagasoff and Jeremy Mason, who have combined to rush for more than 1,400 yards. 
Giordani is a solid quarterback who has completed 55% of his passes for nearly 
1,200 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is not flashy, but has posted two shutouts. Linebacker Dan 
McDonough and defensive lineman Bill Johns anchor a low-profile unit that has 
held opponents to a touchdown or less in five games. Everyone contributes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, I think the scout-team players win the games for us when we face 
them during the week in practice," Giordani said. "Friday, we just find out 
what the score is." 
</P>
<P>
 The scores have been favorable for Newport Harbor. The Sailors are averaging 
23 points per game while giving up only 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other numbers help show how Newport Harbor has grown into one of the more 
successful programs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors have now qualified for six consecutive playoffs. During that time, 
the team's record is 52-19 for a .732 winning percentage. This season, the 
Sailors won their first league championship in Brinkley's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing from the Newport Harbor trophy case is a Southern 
Section championship football plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done that," Brinkley said. "So if that's what it takes for us to 
be considered among the best, then yeah, we're not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Sailors are favored to win a section championship. They will 
begin the Division V playoffs top-seeded, playing host to Saddleback in a 
first-round game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal from the beginning has been to go 14 weeks," McDonough said. "We 
always played it one week at a time, but the ultimate goal was to get to the 
championship game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors reached the championship game in 1992, but lost the Division IV 
title to Irvine, 30-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "That year was good," Giordani said. "The last two to three years, it has 
really come together. We have the complete package now." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a package that took nine years to refine, and the backbone is the 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Brinkley's assistants -- offensive line coach Bill Vetica, defensive 
backs coach Rick Ramirez and running backs coach Bill Brown -- have worked with 
him from the beginning at Newport Harbor. Vetica and Ramirez also worked with 
Brinkley when he coached at Norwalk High. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistants Mike Bargas, Bill Calloway and Mike Downs have been at Newport 
Harbor for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows their roles," Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Ciarelli, defensive coordinator and strength coach, has been at Newport 
Harbor for six years and his biggest impact, perhaps, is felt in the weight 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkley and Ciarelli revamped the weight training facilities and strength and 
conditioning programs, leaving college coaches in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recruiters' jaws drop because they can't believe the type of facilities we 
have," Brinkley said. "One of our track athletes took a recruiting trip to 
Stanford and came back saying that we had a better weight room here." 
</P>
<P>
 That excellence is also apparent in the film room, where the Sailors have 
numerous VCRs and televisions. There is also a computer at their disposal for 
various statistical and record-keeping tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "College coaches have visited and told me they were impressed with our 
equipment," Brinkley said. "These things we felt were necessary to give our 
kids the best chance to compete with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 That has never been more apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the Sailors appeared to be destined to finish in the middle of 
the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
 But a tremendous work ethic and competitive fire has helped them overcome 
individual shortcomings to become a league championship team . 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow this group has gotten together, across the board, and everyone has 
done what needs to be done," Giordani said. "Every week we look around at each 
other and say that we are so lucky to be in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonough appreciates the success a little differently because his older 
brothers, Chris, 24, and Brian, 22, both played for Brinkley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always dreamed of playing here," McDonough said. "It's like a family, 
not just a football team." 
</P>
<P>
 And this team is ready to join the elite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've consistently been to the playoffs, and we finally won that league 
title," Brinkley said. "I think we're ready to take that last step, but we 
won't get ahead of ourselves. This team will take it one at a time."

PROPERTY VALUES: FORECLOSED HOMES AVAILABLE AT BARGAIN RATES; ANTELOPE VALLEY: 
THERE STILL REMAINS A SUPPLY OF CHEAP DEALS FROM FEDERALLY OWNED HOMES TAKEN IN 
FORECLOSURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners in the Antelope Valley have been reeling in recent years as 
they've watched property values tumble and foreclosures escalate. Home sellers 
and home builders have had to compete with fire-sale prices being offered by 
lenders eager to unload their inventory of foreclosed property, sometimes 
called REOs (real estate owned by an institution). 
</P>
<P>
 Some Antelope Valley observers are beginning to see some improvement, though. 
There are 756 homes in foreclosure that are still unsold in Lancaster and 
Palmdale, according to Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla. Builders and 
real estate agents in the Antelope Valley, however, say the foreclosure market 
is finally having a less harmful effect than before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The REOs had a very adverse affect on the market in 1992 and 1993. I don't 
think those homes are as much of a problem today," said Tom Thompson, owner of 
MarketMasters, a research company in Palmdale. Now that the inventory of 
foreclosures is declining, Thompson predicted, many more buyers will be seeking 
new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson also perceives a difference between the typical buyer of a foreclosed 
home or a U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development home and the buyer 
of a newly built home in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The HUD homes particularly are lower valued homes of about 1,400 square feet 
selling for under $100,000," he said. Many of the new home buyers in the 
Antelope Valley are opting for homes with 2,000-plus square feet that sell for 
$100,000 to $150,000, Thompson noted. There aren't any such HUD homes, he said, 
and "there is no longer an REO market in the higher square footages" -- those 
homes, for the most part, have already gone back to the bank and been resold, 
he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 New home buyers want more space than ever before, Thompson said. One Palmdale 
housing project called Spirit by Inco Homes, for example, is offering buyers 
3,000 square feet of space for just $159,900 -- including a washer, dryer and 
back-yard landscaping. Several years ago, Thompson noted, the same house would 
have sold for $100,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
 While many new home builders are beginning to see a better market in the 
Antelope Valley, that improvement isn't yet helping folks who are trying to 
resell their homes, Thompson conceded. "The lower-value resale market is in 
competition with a large supply of foreclosures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An oversupply of homes foreclosed on by private lenders and by the Federal 
Housing Administration has really hurt property owners in the Antelope Valley 
trying to resell their homes, said Raquel Ortega Payne, an agent at Century 21 
Yarrow & Associates in Lancaster. The FHA, particularly, placed many homes on 
the market through HUD, and these foreclosed homes come with low interest rate 
loans and up to $5,000 for new paint and carpeting. Homes that sold in 1991 for 
$90,000 are often selling through HUD for about $65,000, Payne said. With just 
$2,200 for move-in costs and an 8% fixed-rate mortgage, she said, all it takes 
to qualify for a loan is less than about $35,000 a year in income. "You can 
even go out and walk in these neighborhoods at night," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supply of these really cheap deals is beginning to decline. As a result, 
Payne said, many more buyers will soon think about buying a conventional resale 
home -- or even a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we haven't seen an increase in new sales is because of the 
large supply of foreclosures," said Bob Bray, managing director for the Meyers 
Group's Los Angeles-Ventura division in West Los Angeles, which provides 
research and consultation services to home builders. "There are some pretty 
good deals for buyers in the foreclosure market." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homes in foreclosure were built between 1988 and 1994, Bray said, 
and "those are still pretty new homes: They compete directly with new homes." 
</P>
<P>
 While the number of homes going into foreclosure has started to decline, Bray 
said, there isn't any major increase in new home sales or in prices predicted 
any time soon. "Our feeling is that the new home sales will be about same as 
last year or a little less," Bray said. That's about 1,800 new homes.  
</P>
<P>
 "As the economy improves, foreclosure rates will be dropping," he said, "But 
there will be no price appreciation in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Builders are also making a real effort to keep prices down by paring away 
luxury items, he added. "The concept today is to give the buyer a lot of house 
for their money," Bray said. "It's back to the basics. Luxury items are out. 
It's about shelter and affordability." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite continuing weak sales of new homes in the Antelope Valley, home 
builders are readying several new large-scale projects that could eventually 
total more than 30,000 new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers of Ritter Ranch are planning 7,200 residences nestled in the 
Sierra Pelona Mountains at the southwestern edge of the Antelope Valley. 
Kaufman & Broad plans to build 5,200 residences at a project named City Ranch 
in Palmdale. Another 4,700 homes have been approved at Serrano Ranch Co. in the 
Lancaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the roughly 1,800 to 2,000 annual new home sales in the Antelope Valley 
reported by the Meyers Group, it would take about 17 years to sell out the 
major projects on the drawing boards in the Lancaster and Palmdale areas alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience is the key to success in home building, said Jeff Mezger, division 
president at Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. in Palmdale. While there seems to be an 
oversupply of projects proposed in the Antelope Valley, he said, "there is a 
difference between projects proposed and actually brought on line. Just because 
a project is proposed doesn't mean it will get financed. The financial 
institutions are being fairly conservative." That means that the surviving 
builders will be those who have deeper pockets and who can be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Population in the Antelope Valley doubled from 1980 to 1990 to about 250,000 
residents. Builders are counting on continued population growth of about 4% a 
year. Postscript:

 My column last week on "Finding the Funds to Fix Quake Damage" generated a 
great deal of interest. But I received several calls from readers who were 
frustrated because some of the funding sources mentioned in the column weren't 
easily available. Several readers, for example, called the Community 
Development Commission of Los Angeles County -- which seemed unfamiliar with 
its own assistance programs. I subsequently called the commission and advised 
it to read its brochure, "Owner-Occupied Home Improvement Program." The 
commission, in turn, suggested that callers talk to FEMA first. It's no wonder 
some callers felt that they were being led in circles. 
</P>
<P>
 But I did make a mistake. The Gas Co. -- which in July launched a Community 
Partnership for Earthquake Repair program -- is not making loans available to 
earthquake victims. It is only repair aid and services that are being offered 
to qualified low-income, elderly and disabled residents, such as providing work 
crews to repair stucco walls, doors, stoves, damaged chimneys and the 
weatherstripping of a home. Those interested in this help should call (800) 
331-7593.

BODY WATCH; CRUNCH APPEAL; HOLD THE PUDDING AND PORRIDGE, AND PASS THE POTATO 
CHIPS AND POPCORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 When Chicago dietitian Alicia Moag-Stahlberg is under stress and hungry, 
she'll usually snack sensibly on low-fat popcorn or pretzels. But sometimes 
nothing will do but extra crunchy shoestring potatoes -- even though they pack 
a wallop of fat and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a regular potato chip," she explains. "These shoestring 
potatoes crunch more." 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the appeal for Moag-Stahlberg and millions of other noisy 
noshers: They're hooked on crunch appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's not a lot of science behind why we crave crunchy foods, there 
are several reasonable theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunchy foods can ease tensions after a long day, says Elizabeth Ward, a staff 
dietitian for the Harvard Community Health Plan, Boston, and a spokeswoman for 
the American Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about what it feels like to chew something very crunchy," she suggests. 
"Compare an apple to applesauce. The apple takes so much more work to grind it 
with your teeth that you are using those muscles in your face that you may 
tense up during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Tense people can also feel the effects of stress in their neck and shoulder 
areas, she adds, and eating something crunchy might help relax those muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward adopted the tension-reducing theory after her sister-in-law explained her 
fondness for rice cakes by saying, "It just tastes so good to chew." 
</P>
<P>
 Although crunchy foods aren't meant as a substitute for stress-reduction 
classes or an hour with a good therapist, Dr. Mark Goulston says the 
tension-reducing theory makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the world bites you, you want to bite back," says the Santa Monica 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is scientific literature on cravings, "there is not a lot of 
science about why one craves crunchy foods and another craves smoother foods," 
Moag-Stahlberg says. "But we eat for a lot of reasons. Hunger is one of the 
lower ones (on the list). Sensory satisfaction is way up high, and part of that 
is not only taste but texture. People like in-your-face eating experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Crunchiness can also enhance the sensory experience of eating, according to 
food chemists, who, of course, don't call it crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food chemists talk about fractureability," explains Susan Brewer, an 
associate professor of foods and nutrition at the University of Illinois, 
Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of hard candy. When you put it between your back teeth and bear down, 
it fractures and falls away from the pressure rather than compressing or 
smashing or sticking to your teeth. Normally, that (fractureability) is one of 
the main aspects of crunchiness -- the ability to fracture off cleanly, as 
opposed to sticking to the teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 And let's not overlook the auditory dimension of The Crunch. ("For some 
eaters, sound is very important," Brewer says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Or its place as a diet aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good crunchy foods, in general, are high in fiber and are filling," Ward 
says. "They take longer to chew than other foods. You feel like you've really 
eaten something." 
</P>
<P>
 But it might not be a good idea for dieters to rely only on fat-free crunchy 
foods, particularly because part of the appeal of crunchy foods might be the 
fat and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Moag-Stahlberg suggests indulging in small portions of crunchy foods with fat 
and salt, satisfying the crunch/salt/fat urge in one fell swoop. Better to have 
a few crackers with salt and fat and feel full than to have a half-gallon of 
air-popped corn and still feel deprived. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunchy foods could also be a boon for dental health, although those with jaw 
problems are wise to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain crunchy foods that act as detergents on the teeth -- your 
natural plaque removers, like fresh fruits and vegetables," says Linda Niessen, 
professor of dentistry at Baylor College of Dentistry, Dallas. But crunchy 
refined foods -- because of added ingredients such as sugars and complex 
starches -- could promote tooth decay. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunching ice is discouraged, Niessen says, because "it can cause microscopic 
cracks in the enamel, which can weaken the tooth." Biting down too forcefully 
on peanut brittle, hard candy or other hard foods can harm the teeth, too. 
</P>
<P>
 If crunch adds variety and pleasure, go for it, nutritionists advise. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ward: "Because we get hung up on nutrients, we tend to overlook that 
eating is also a psychological experience. And it has to be satisfying on so 
many levels for people to feel nourished."
