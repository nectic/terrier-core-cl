BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; GOING STRAIGHT TO THE HEART OF A FAMILY'S DAILY 
DILEMMAS; SOULS RAISED FROM THE DEAD, BY DORIS BETTS ; KNOPF; $23, 339 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Doris Betts asks big questions here about the relationship of faith and fate, 
the boundaries of family and the endurance of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Souls Raised From the Dead," a tragic novel about a white, working-class, 
Southern family, is Betts' first book in more than 10 years. Primarily known 
for her short stories, the 62-year-old North Carolinian has published six other 
works of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescent, horse-wild Mary Grace Thompson is the source of light and the 
locus of truce in a family weighed down by economic struggle and ancient 
feuding. Her father, Frank, is worn ragged by his job as a North Carolina State 
Patrolman and her absent mother, Christine, is off selling cosmetics and 
searching anxiously for the fountain of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 A sometimes somber, sometimes humorous background chorus is provided by four 
bickering grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly everyone's life becomes even tougher: Mary is struck with a 
life-threatening kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Betts, particularly strong on evoking Southern geography and mores, locates 
these people in the tattered neighborhoods of the celebrated academic Research 
Triangle. Frank aches to move his family from the tacky apartment with its thin 
walls and problematic neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Class divisions are dramatic for Mary and her school friends: 
</P>
<P>
 "They learned it was easy to sort their own kind from other kinds -- sometimes 
by race or grammar, by clothes, by bus riders versus car-pool riders; they got 
the athletes separated from the bookworms, and the criminals-in-training set 
aside from the boys who were wild now but would later polish their wildness 
into a social grace in some good fraternity; by grade eight everybody knew 
which pretty girls would get away with being pretty and which would be betrayed 
by teen-age pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Betts reveals the importance of Christianity in the Thompson family, the 
pleasures of home-cooked food at a family picnic, the village atmosphere of 
Chapel Hill during uncongested summers. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mary moves toward and past her 13th birthday, she becomes sicker and seems 
to be the only one clear-eyed and brave enough to acknowledge that she is 
dying. Others rally around in painfully optimistic attempts to solicit or 
simulate miracles. This well-loved child manages to gather her fractious family 
for a huge, multi-generational reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Betts skillfully crosses generations with impressive knowledge of idioms, 
vocabulary and cultural tastes. She understands the psychological stresses 
faced by contemporary teen-agers as well as college students like Mary's riding 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 Poignantly she constructs Frank's middle-aged financial, sexual and career 
agonies. The portrayal of the half-satisfied, half-disappointed grandparents' 
generation is particularly moving. 
</P>
<P>
 But the description of Christine veers into caricature: A fashion plate with 
Valley Girl intonation ("OK?"!) and the perfect figure, Christine deserts her 
daughter for a parodied career as glamour mentor and radio host of "Tina's 
Arena." She goes through a succession of airhead men, exploits the family 
reunion to peddle make-up, skips the country as Mary gets sicker, even winds up 
coloring her hair blond. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine is the most superficial, most racist, most selfish of all these 
characters -- the perfect 1990s projection of evil, who seems to relieve others 
of moral culpability by dint of her extreme villainy. Exhibit A is her 
reluctance to sacrifice a kidney to her daughter. The social jury is appalled 
by such "unnatural" reluctance, as if vital organs were family property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a stunning opening, Betts somehow loses her grip on this narrative. The 
book diffuses into subplot after unresolved subplot. Frank's girlfriend has 
also suffered the loss of a child -- giving up the baby for adoption rather 
than having an abortion as the selfish Christine would no doubt have done -- 
but this intriguing thread is dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Souls Raised From the Dead" becomes repetitive, as Betts goes into so much 
cumbersome detail about kidney failure and renal treatment that you wonder if 
she has had firsthand heartbreak with the disease or simply can't bear to 
withhold bits of fascinating research.  
</P>
<P>
 She almost regains control in the last 50 pages, when she explores the grief 
of Mary's family and friends and when, in a brilliant imaginative leap, she 
describes a recently murdered neighbor visiting Mary in the hospital and 
leading the dying girl to eternity.  
</P>
<P>
 Betts' intelligent curiosity has taken us to the heart of daily dilemmas. 
"Souls Raised From the Dead" is an ambitious book and could have been a great 
one with a little more stylistic revision and generosity of spirit as well as a 
more rigorous editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Betts is a very talented writer with an acute eye and a seasoned 
appreciation of human experience.

THEATER REVIEW; WE COULD DO WITH MORE OF THIS KIND OF 'HYSTERIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fair sex. The weaker sex. The pregnant sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Young believes women continue to be slaves to their bodies -- or to 
society's notions about their bodies. It's time for an Emancipation 
Proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 But her "Hysteria," at the Actors' Gang Theatre, is no solemn decree. It's a 
zingy musical comedy -- and some of the best evidence yet to refute the old 
canard that feminists are humorless. Staged satire is seldom this provocative, 
this meaty, this engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, an earlier version of "Hysteria" was mounted in the Gang's former 
home at 2nd Stage, a few blocks away. As with many of the Gang's sprawling 
productions, that stage was too small. "Hysteria" looks and sounds better now. 
</P>
<P>
 Young manages to sustain and unite two different narratives, set more than a 
hundred years apart in two different countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Her contemporary American story is built around Garnet Poindexter (Kate 
Mulligan), newly pregnant and not yet glowing. Her husband neglects her, and 
the family to which she has returned is, well, eccentric. Mom (Patti Tippo) is 
an ex-supermodel who isn't adjusting well to middle age, Dad (Daniel Parker) is 
touting his latest line of unisex clothing by wearing women's garb. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Garnet's sisters. Corky (Tricia Parks) has imagined she's 
pregnant ever since a traumatic incident at college and has been a recluse for 
months now, awaiting her first contractions. Taylor (Evie Peck) wants to follow 
her mother into the modeling trade, even if it takes a few visits to Dr. Sandra 
Needles (Laurel Ollstein), mom's plastic surgeon. She's encouraged in her 
delusion by her father's lecherous friend Chadley (Kyle Gass), the cosmetics 
king. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, while examining old photos, Garnet suddenly finds herself in the 
presence of her great-great-grandmother Lilymoist Teagarden (Cari Dean 
Whittemore), a fluttery Victorian miss who, in 1888, has been diagnosed with 
female "hysteria" and confined indoors by her bullying doctor (Parker). Lily 
gets a second opinion from Lydia Tripplehorn (Molly Bryant), a speechifying 
crusader for women's rights and a champion of the condom and the clitoris. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the cast playing roles in both centuries, Young cleverly brings 
her stories together, eventually focusing on Lily's unwanted pregnancy as much 
as Garnet's. For this latest version, Young brings Lily's lover Heathcliff (V. 
J. Foster) out on stage for a funny, swoony seduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Young also changed the beginning -- sacrificing some childhood memories for a 
more coherent introduction to the family -- and the ending, which now includes 
a note of reconciliation between two arch-enemies. She's out to make a point, 
but she doesn't pretend that abortion is a painless choice or that the other 
side has no principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult audiences (there are bare breasts and frank talk) should welcome this 
savvy cartoon with open arms -- and minds. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hysteria," Actors' Gang, 6209 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. 
Ends June 18. $12-$15. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 hours, 45 minutes.

ART REVIEW; 'GOLD' MINES A WEALTH OF HISTORY; THE BAROQUE EXHIBITION SENDS 
HOPEFUL MESSAGE OF PORTUGAL'S RESILIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Gold and Grandeur: The Age of the Baroque in Portugal" is an exhibition with 
a story to tell. The story has two parts: One is of bristling international 
power and astounding aristocratic wealth in the 18th Century, which was 
suddenly shaken to the core by unspeakable devastation; the other is of how 
Portugal miraculously climbed back from ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 History is not the show's only interest, however. "Gold and Grandeur" is 
plainly being offered as an allegory for Portugal's precarious modern 
situation. As much as a sensuous wallow in often staggering past glories, it's 
a pep talk for the present, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gold and Grandeur" began life as an exhibition last November at the National 
Gallery of Art in Washington. During the show's run, plans to add the San Diego 
Museum of Art as its only other venue were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 It opened Sunday pretty much intact, although a few signal pieces have been 
deleted. A rather smallish exhibition, its 118 objects have been given a 
generous array of gallery space on two floors of the Balboa Park museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The show focuses almost exclusively on decorative arts -- furniture, silver 
services, porcelain and faience pots, jewelry, religious vestments and such -- 
including the blue-and-white painted tile panels called azulejos common to 
Portugal. A monumental azulejo panorama showing early 18th-Century Lisbon -- 
it's 66 feet long -- is among those few works that haven't made the westward 
trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, unless you see the show by the end of the first week in June, you'll 
miss one of its most arresting religious objects: the "Sacramento Monstrance" 
(circa 1760), an astonishing sculptural concoction for displaying a consecrated 
host behind a glass window surrounded by a halo of jewels. A life-size, 
genuflecting angel of gilded, polychromed wood holds aloft a 400-pound sphere 
of highly polished, jewel-encrusted silver surrounded by an aureole of tapering 
silver rays. The monstrance towers over mere mortals who stand before it. 
</P>
<P>
 The composition is based on the classical motif of Atlas struggling to carry 
the heavens on his shoulders. Unlike the pagan Titan, however, this angel isn't 
working up a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown craftsman designed the monumental monstrance with such 
illusionistic skill as to make the huge, light-reflective silver sphere appear 
to float serenely in the space above the enraptured angel's head. Since the 
ostentatiously displayed wafer represents the body of Christ that miraculously 
ascended into the heavens, it's a powerfully realized metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Sacramento Monstrance" will be removed from the show June 6 because it 
must return to Portugal to serve as the identifying logo for Lisbon '94, a 
yearlong arts festival. Lisbon is this year's so-called "Capital of Culture," a 
changing designation made annually by the European Union to help boost tourism 
and trade among its member nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Portugal, the designation is significant. Since the mid-1980s, its 
free-marketeer prime minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva, has directed landmark 
growth; the once-isolated nation on the Atlantic end of the Iberian Peninsula 
has been integrated into the European Union. Recently, the country climbed out 
of the economic cellar among EU member-nations, surpassing Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 The American museum exhibition is important to Portugal, too. U.S. loan shows 
of foreign treasures often carry symbolic weight to bolster pragmatic goals. In 
the 1970s, artifacts from King Tut's tomb helped prepare the way for a dramatic 
change in Middle East foreign policy. In the 1980s, "Mexico: Splendors of 
Thirty Centuries" underscored an ongoing shift toward economic privatization in 
Mexico and helped grease the wheels for NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, Portugal is making a bid. The aspirations for "Gold and 
Grandeur" might not be extravagant, but they're unmistakable nonetheless. As 
the small, poor nation labors to dramatically increase economic growth and to 
reach out to an international marketplace, it has assembled an exhibition that 
celebrates the remarkable fruits of an earlier period of phenomenal expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal in the 18th Century was incalculably rich, thanks to a firm 
foundation of colonialist exploits around the globe. With the uncovering of 
huge deposits of gold, diamonds and other precious stones in Brazil, the little 
kingdom was catapulted into the stratosphere of European powers. 
</P>
<P>
 European Baroque culture is marked by rambunctious designs depicting expansive 
growth, organic profusion and constant movement. In painting, horizon lines 
often lower or even disappear, replaced by pictorial suggestions of infinity. 
Sculptural stasis is banished, in favor of swirling dynamism or voluminous 
airiness. Luxury abounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which features spectacular samples from the world's largest 
collection of royal silver and enough gigantic jewels to choke De Beers, 
attests to the Portuguese dream of rivaling France's aristocracy in its glutted 
display of sumptuous excess. Designs indigenous to China, Brazil and other 
sites of Portuguese conquest are reinterpreted in writing desks and pottery. 
And much of the work in the exhibition wasn't made in Portugal; instead it 
reflects Portuguese taste, and the economic power to import products of skill 
and fashion from England, France, Italy and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant Baroque motif of lush, organic growth added a blaring aura of 
moral rightness to the Colonial carnage necessary to maintain such rapacious 
pomp. The style made power seem a force of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the political use of Baroque imagery more outrageous than in an 
immense carriage meant to carry a Portuguese ambassador to the Vatican to wow 
the Pope. The carriage's back end, which approaches the complexity of a Rose 
Parade float, features a gilded carving of the personification of Portugal, 
attended by allegorical figures of prosperity and triumph, lording over a 
captive Moor and a vanquished Turk. The captives are portrayed as entirely too 
satisfied with their ignominious fate. 
</P>
<P>
 All this gold and grandeur was rudely interrupted in 1755, however, when an 
earthquake said to have shaken for some 13 minutes reduced Lisbon to a pile of 
gilded rubble. The temblor killed more than 10,000 inhabitants (the king, by 
chance, was out of town), set off nine days of raging fires and destroyed 
countless artistic treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteenth-Century Pat Robertsons declared the natural disaster to be God's 
revenge on a profligate people. The monarch, bolstered by the iron will of the 
brilliant Marques de Pombal, nonetheless proceeded to rebuild the city on a 
modern, rationalist plan. The diamonds encrusting subsequent jewelry got even 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the show's two paintings, installed at the entrance, is a stiff, 1766 
portrait of Pombal seated high above a serenely rebuilt Lisbon, his masterful 
reconstruction plans strewn at his feet and sky's-the-limit clouds rolling past 
his head. The painting is dull and didactic, but its symbolism for present-day 
Portugal is striking. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal, led by its Capital of Culture, is celebrating the 20th anniversary 
of the start of recovery from its contemporary equivalent to the brutal 
destruction caused by the 18th-Century earthquake. In 1974 the vicious, 40-year 
rule of Western Europe's longest-lived modern dictator, Antonio Salazar, came 
to an end. "Gold and Grandeur: The Age of the Baroque in Portugal" looks back 
at an earlier moment of prosperity interrupted by cruel disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the show's dazzling display seems almost as calculated as the gilded 
back-end of the ambassadorial carriage that is its centerpiece. We came back 
from ruin once, the show forthrightly declares; surely we can do it again. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; PAUL CARMAN AND E.S.P.: A KEEN SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Carman has a good thing going. The saxophonist has led his quartet, 
E.S.P., every Tuesday at Randell's for two years and is scheduled to continue 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 His appearance Tuesday showed why Carman has stuck around. Coming a week 
before the release of his first album, "Passion," on his own Crystal Sound 
label, the San Luis Obispo-based musician demonstrated a winning formula that 
combines the best of mainstream and contemporary sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of Frank Zappa's late-'80s ensembles that recorded such albums as 
"Make a Jazz Noise Here" and "Broadway the Hard Way," Carman makes no 
commercial compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly playing original music, he and his band -- keyboardist Mark Massey, 
upright bassist Joel Hamilton and drummer Steve DiStanislao -- showed the 
invigorating sense of camaraderie that comes from having polished the music 
over a long period of time. Their familiarity with the music, and with one 
another, allows Carman and company to take tunes and improvisations into 
ambitious, rewarding territory. 
</P>
<P>
 His opener, "Dreams of a Burbank Spokesperson," typified Carman's approach. 
The clever, driving theme carried enough changes to keep listeners engaged 
without straying too far from accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Working on alto, he maneuvered easily through his improvisation, building 
dynamically as he progressed while not relying on histrionics. Carman isn't 
afraid of the upper register of his instrument. But he doesn't rely on it, as 
do so many of today's saxophonists, to make moving statements. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Burbank Spokesperson" put an up-to-date spin on the type of neo-bop 
characterized by '60s edition of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, "Passion," 
following basic blues variations, was more in the contemporary ballad mode. Its 
pleasant, major-key theme showcased Carman's alto tone, which, unlike most 
contemporary alto players of the day, owes little to David Sanborn. 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist has a way of floating on extended tones, inflating their 
volume and impact before he moves on. As the tune's theme ended tightly on a 
loud exclamation, he moved into some Hank Crawford-inspired lines spurred by 
bassist Hamilton's country funk. 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist worked up some dissonant lines as his solo built in intensity, 
while Massey, an attentive and responsive accompanist, added full-bodied 
backing. The solo, like the theme, ended on a clipped exclamation before Massey 
moved into his solo on an emotional series of descending lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Don't Want to Be Alone" featured Carman's considered soprano stylings, 
played with a tone and attack that recalled Wayne Shorter's work. "Gimme a 
Melvin," a title inspired by the gym-class prank where one's shorts are 
tightened with an unsolicited yank, featured a fast-breaking introductory line 
powered by Hamilton's fleet bass lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The tune proved a showcase for drummer DiStanislao, who mixed it up between 
snare, toms and cymbals while Carman's soprano sailed over head. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's willingness to experiment was visible on the set's only standard: 
Thelonious Monk's "I Mean You." Carman trailed just-so behind the keyboard on 
the quirky theme, giving Monk's perky ditty an added twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Massey delivered a very unlike-Monk solo, adding stomp, shout and glissando, 
while Carman followed with busts of notes on alto. The effect was one of the 
evening's most exhilarating moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Carman's music may be too involved to win airplay on Wave-format stations, and 
too modern for the KLON-FM playlist. But he's on to something good, and those 
who like both thought and energy as well as solid musicianship in their jazz 
would do well to check out the saxophonist and his combo. 
</P>

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; 'SNOW WHITE' ADDS LIGHT TOUCHES FOR FUN, COMFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A night light can give a child an extra measure of security, and Broadway on 
Tour children's theater production of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" 
provides one, literally and figuratively. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted from the fairy tale by BOT founder Daniel Halkyard and show director 
Maria Gam-Hudson, this version (which continues Saturday and Sunday through 
June 26 at The City shopping center) sticks close enough to the original story 
line to be a comfort to children making their first venture into the unknown 
world of live theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Snow, driven from her castle by the venomous queen, finds sanctuary with 
seven dwarfs in the forest. Disguised as an old crone, the queen finds her and 
poisons her with a tainted apple, sending Snow into a (presumably) eternal 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the dwarfs are bummed. But soon the Handsome Prince arrives, plants 
a wet one on Snow's forehead and revives her. Cue beaming dwarfs, exit happy 
couple. The end. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to make things a little cozier, Halkyard recently introduced the "BOT 
Night Light," a small blue light that casts a reassuring glow during the show's 
scarier moments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for adults and older children, however, Gam-Hudson and Halkyard 
have thrown in plot twists and characterizations that keep the show from 
becoming too juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7- to 16-year-old cast handles the mix admirably; Holly Winters as Snow 
White and Kelly Godfrey-Allen (the cast's only adult) as the Dark Queen, 
especially, play their parts with enough campy humor to carry even a bored 
preteen through the show's 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In this version, Snow shares the spotlight with a new character, the 
Jester-Prince. It seems that Snow and her Prince were bosom buddies as 
children, but the two haven't seen each other for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 16, Snow is preparing to be reunited and apparently wed to her Prince 
when, in a jealous rage over Snow's beauty, the Queen sends her off to the 
forest to be killed by the huntsman. 
</P>
<P>
 When her life is spared, she finds housing with the help of her friend, the 
Court Jester who, under a spell from the evil Queen, is actually the Prince. 
The jester's inability to reveal his true identity makes for some poignant 
moments between him and Snow, which actor Ryan Buttes plays up with controlled 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus for older audiences is the fact that Winters plays this Snow 
considerably less saccharine than most. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she's almost petulant. When the huntsman demands she give up a 
treasured pendant as proof to the Queen of her death, she pouts; and when the 
Jester offers her the dwarf's cottage as a haven, she turns her nose up at 
their housekeeping and decorating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogue by Gam-Hudson and Halkyard also gives Winters some prime moments: 
When the queen-as-crone asks for lodging at the cottage, Snow cheerily refers 
her to "that nice little Motel 6 down the way. You know, the one with the 
little light on." 
</P>
<P>
 The dwarf characters, which include talkative Gabby and the ever-despondent 
Gloomy Gus, are more one-dimensional by design, although Brian Michener's Sarge 
does make the most of his military lingo. 
</P>
<P>
 And the repartee they and Snow engage in with children in the audience was a 
big hit at last Saturday's performance. (Note: the first two rows are reserved 
at all BOT shows for young children.) 
</P>
<P>
 Godfrey-Allen anchors for the cast. Swathed in black and possessing a Grade A 
evil cackle, she is unquestionably the supreme mistress here. It's no wonder 
that, in Halkyard's remarks before the curtain goes up, he assures children 
that "she's just an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of community and college theater, Godfrey-Allen knows how to stop 
short of melodrama and shows off a fine sense of comic timing with her 
throwaway lines as well as a touch of pathos when she meets her fate at the end 
of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Costumes by Ambra Wakefield and Laurie Holden range from adequate to inspired 
(the Mirror's silver and white confection is especially nice). Some choices for 
the recorded score are questionable, especially the disco tune to which Snow 
and her Prince jive at the beginning and end of the show.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ACT ONE' FESTIVAL SERIES GETS OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sponsored by Showtime and currently playing at the Met, "Act One" is an 
ambitious festival of 15 new one-act plays presented in three evenings that has 
been ballyhooed as a "marriage" between the theatrical and television 
communities. If not exactly a shotgun wedding, the nuptials are long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays were chosen from some 2,000 submissions after a nationwide search. 
Those playwrights selected run the gamut from seasoned hands to relative 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some flaws, "Evening A" augurs well for the rest of the series. Not 
that this particular evening didn't have its share of problems -- offstage. 
Vincent Canby's "After All" was postponed at the last moment due to an illness 
in the cast. (Nothing serious. John Randolph, who stars in the piece with 
Katherine Helmond, was ailing but reportedly on the mend.) 
</P>
<P>
 With Canby's play temporarily out of the lineup, the opener was David 
Simpatico's bitterly amusing "Wish Fulfillment," which concerns a young man's 
wild musings about how to tell his father he is gay. Simpatico's play, 
well-performed by Kirk Baltz and Jack Wallace, is basically a one-liner, but 
one that packs a dramatic punch along with the laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also a bit of a one-liner, "Dice and Cards," by Sam Henry Kass, is essentially 
a dialogue between a spectacularly obtuse wiseguy and his exasperated mobster 
boss. Kass' amusing but somewhat limited premise is a prime opportunity for a 
couple of scenery-chomping actors. Robert Pastorelli and Adam Goldberg, in 
their respective roles as the boss and the buffoon, clearly relish every moment 
of their feast, as does the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 More a character study than a play, David Rasche's "Jackie" is also very funny 
although ultimately darker. Diana Bellamy turns in a hilarious performance as 
Jackie, a chain-smoking good-ol'-gal-turned-Hollywood-agent who spews a 
Texas-sized gusher of chat that would shame the most outrageous Hollywood 
schmoozer. Bellamy's gripping performance, punctuated by a horrible cigarette 
hack, shows the terrible fear of mortality and failure under the bonhomie. 
</P>
<P>
 The final offering, "Sticks and Stones," is the evening's set piece. Written 
by previously unproduced playwrights Drew McWeeny and Scott Swann, the play 
revolves around a high-powered attorney (Jonathan Silverman) and a racist cop 
(Louis Mustillo) who is on trial for the hate-slaying of a black youth. (He 
insists it was in the line of duty.)  
</P>
<P>
 Director Jerry Levine and his fine cast plumb the emotional depths in the 
piece, which poses provocative questions about the nature of racism, the abuses 
of the press and the lethal power of the spoken word. 
</P>
<P>

COMEDY REVIEW; DREW CAREY LOOKS LIKE A FUNNY GUY . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his crew-cut and horn-rimmed glasses, Drew Carey looks like a high-school 
science teacher, circa 1963. That alone is enough to set him apart from most 
comics working the club circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also has an unusual delivery -- an even, low-key vocal style and a light 
touch with physical comedy that serves his material well. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the material itself, alas, that holds Carey back. Repeatedly during his 
set Tuesday at the Irvine Improv (where he plays through Sunday), Carey strayed 
into potentially rewarding comic terrain, only to let that potential slip away 
into commonplace observation. With Carey, you want to laugh, but the payoff 
just isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 The forays into standard-issue comic subjects didn't fare any better. Carey 
has a precise and often whimsical way with words, but even that can only go so 
far in disguising a general lack of ideas. Gee, aren't marijuana smokers 
forgetful? Zzzzzzz . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A few items hit the mark. A bit about the cold winters in his native Cleveland 
evolved into a delightfully against-the-grain diatribe against environmental 
correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's that global warming we've been hearing so much about?" he demanded, 
offering an image of Cleveland residents on their lawns, spraying aerosol cans 
into the air in an attempt to raise the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 He wondered aloud why people only strive to save the cute animals, saying he'd 
like to see a movie called "Free Willard." And about the whale in "Free Willy": 
"I guess it was OK to lock him up while they were making the movie, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carey operates best at a certain level of whimsy and surprise that plays 
against his super-straight physical aura. He has a sitcom-ready persona, and 
indeed he was a star of the NBC series "The Good Life," which was left off the 
schedule for next fall when the network announced its season a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They canceled the show. Thanks for all the cards and letters," Carey said 
sarcastically not long after taking the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey is distinctive enough that he may soon land back on TV. In the meantime, 
the break may provide a good opportunity to hone his stage material. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drew Carey continues through Sunday at the Irvine Improv, 4255 Campus Drive, 
Irvine. Show time tonight: 8:30. $8. (714) 854-5455.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MADWOMEN' A WARM TALE OF SURVIVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Allie Light's absorbing "Dialogues With Madwomen," seven highly articulate 
women of superior intelligence tell us their stories of enduring and eventually 
overcoming mental illness. Neither a downer nor a dry series of case studies, 
the documentary is a warm, encouraging experience shot through with survivors' 
humor. What's unsettling -- and properly so -- is that so much of what these 
women have gone through is what countless others have gone through; by and 
large the only difference is that these interviewees' ordeals conspired to 
trigger mental breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 That Light, a veteran Oscar-winning San Francisco documentarian, picked an 
array of women who vary widely enough in age, education, race, ethnicity and 
sexual orientation reinforces the impact and implications of the substantial 
commonality in their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Most had nightmarish childhoods at the hands of crazed, sometimes alcoholic 
parents; several were sexually abused by fathers or stepfathers; several 
suffered as members of minority groups; a number are clearly highly creative 
and imaginative; and the majority had truly terrible, even devastating, initial 
experiences with the mental-health care establishment until they at last 
received the help they needed -- even so, you have the feeling that they all 
had a great deal to do with their own healing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, you're left with the feeling that their negative environments in 
childhood, rather than organic causes, had far more to do with precipitating 
their ordeals. Even so, you wish that Light had asked her subjects whether 
doctors had ever found any physical conditions that might have rendered them 
more vulnerable to what in their own persuasive words were terrible conditions. 
 
</P>
<P>
 They are an engaging group of individuals capable of speaking of themselves 
with wit and detachment. One young women, sexually abused by a father who 
enforced nudity and no privacy within his home, speaks on her multiple 
personality disorder and what it was like when she was finally able to 
integrate all 25 of them into one. A young African American, as brilliant as 
she is lovely, speaks of taking a leave of absence from law school to relieve 
tension only to become the victim of a rape at a spa where she had gone to 
unwind.  
</P>
<P>
 Two of the women own up to continuing vulnerability, one still working out 
rage, especially toward her abusive father, the other a thoroughly engaging 
free-spirited woman who once heard voices and believed she and her great dream 
love, Bob Dylan, would save the world together. At 44, this woman admits she 
has never experienced the passionate love relationship she has always craved. 
She says she would end her life if she didn't believe it could still happen to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Light is especially inspired in the ways in which she ends "Dialogues With 
Madwomen" -- first with a genuine and positive surprise revelation and then 
with a heart-wrenching coda on the tragic fate of one of the women in her film. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; PANAMANIAN PIANIST STRAYS FROM KEYBOARD AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Danilo Perez should just consider keeping his hands out of the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 That's "out," not "off." 
</P>
<P>
 When he approached the instrument in traditional fashion during his opening 
set at Catalina on Tuesday night, the results were often impressive.At 27, the 
young Panamanian artist has the makings of a first-rate jazz pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while his adventurous desire to explore the piano's other sound-producing 
capabilities via string plucking, stroking and hammering is understandable, his 
forays inside the instrument's box provided little more than mildly exotic 
sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the program was devoted to material from his new album, "The Journey." 
Pieces such as "The Capture," "Chains," "The Arrival" and "Flight to Freedom" 
made a valiant effort to atmospherically depict the slavery history of the 
Western hemisphere. Much of it was well-crafted jazz, proficiently played, yet 
curiously lacking any emotional thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez and his musicians -- saxophonist Larry Schneider, drummer Ignacio Berroa 
and bassist Larry Grenadier -- sounded far more energetic in the only standard 
of the set, "My Shining Hour." Schneider, freed from reading Perez's scores, 
finally broke loose with an explosive alto solo, and Berroa's drum impromptu 
blended rhythmic momentum with a surprising timbral inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, Perez finally revealed some of the straight-ahead jazz skills 
that were such an attractive element in his work with Dizzy Gillespie. He would 
do well to retain that aspect of his playing as he expands his own musical 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Danilo Perez at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. 
(213) 466-2210. $12 cover and two-drink minimum, except Saturday, $15 cover and 
two-drink minimum. Perez plays two sets each night, 9 and 11, through Sunday.

CLUB REVIEW; BOB'S IS CLOSE TO HIPSTER HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once Bob's Frolic III works out a few kinks, the new Hollywood club is going 
to make some local bands, as well as local scenesters, happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Open since April 1, the tiny (capacity: 85) club offers its stage to about 18 
rock and blues acts from Tuesday through Saturday.The first order of business 
is to get the sound system up to snuff, and the second is to hire another 
bartender. On a recent night, the line at the bar was three people deep. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the stage is a mere inch higher than the floor, so unless you're 
particularly tall you might miss the band altogether. A show last week by the 
alternative band Loungefly was audible but not very visible. 
</P>
<P>
 But the club (one of three Frolic Rooms around Hollywood) has its strong 
points too. It's similar in spirit to the now-defunct Central -- dingy and 
unglamorous, and therefore relaxing and low-key. It's clearly a club that's 
about the music -- primarily the local scene -- and it even offers some aural 
surprises away from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 From Madonna's "Borderline" to the Sex Pistols' "Submission," the jukebox 
keeps the between-sets music unpredictable and amusing. The fact that you might 
also get an earful of the Beach Boys or Julio Iglesias, coupled with the 
backroom's three billiard tables, explains in part why the Frolic III is 
beginning to resemble hipster heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bob's Frolic III, 6202 Santa Monica Blvd. Enter from El Centro . (213) 
463-0827 . Cover varies, free parking at strip mall on southeast corner of 
Santa Monica and Vine. HEIDI SIEGMUND

MUSIC REVIEW; CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY HOSTS 2 PIANISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a little help from some friends, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber 
Music Society made a disparate program fly higher than might have been expected 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest pianists Bryan Pezzone and Lina Targonsky -- the first, a veteran 
performer of new music about town and elsewhere, the second, the wife (but not 
only) of Philharmonic assistant concertmaster Mark Baranov -- offered strong 
contributions to their respective ensembles, in University Synagogue in 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 To be frank, there was at least one listener in the audience who wasn't 
looking forward to another trek through the swamps of Tchaikovsky's A-minor 
Trio, Opus 50, but the performers on hand, Targonsky, Baranov -- not 
incidentally, both Moscow-trained -- and cellist Barry Gold soon changed his 
mind. A performance of pointed subtlety and cinematic sweep proved that there 
is more in this score than most musicians usually find. 
</P>
<P>
 Baranov led the way with wonderfully heated but never overblown violin 
playing, Targonsky added meaningfully colored, nuanced and, when needed, hefty 
pianism (despite a dropped note or two), and Gold provided burnished, lyric 
flights of his own. The piece sang from beginning to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Pezzone took a rare trip (for him) into the Classical repertory with violinist 
Barry Socher, violist Evan N. Wilson and cellist Daniel Rothmuller in 
Beethoven's Piano Quartet, Opus 16. He gave a consistently and interestingly 
sculpted reading in the featured role, while the string trio, matched in sound 
and temperament, argued convincingly for this arrangement over the composer's 
original for winds. 
</P>
<P>
 In between came American composer Eric Ewazen's Quintet for English Horn and 
Strings of 1991, a thoroughly accessible, forgettable work -- bucolic, 
impressionistic modalism -- but well-crafted and harmless enough. A more rugged 
and contrasted reading than that given by the polished group headed by English 
hornist Carolyn Hove might have helped its cause, but probably not much.

ART REVIEWS; 'U-PIC-IT': FOCUS ON PHOTOGRAPHY'S STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "U-Pic-It," Larry Hammerness transforms Sue Spaid Fine Art to resemble the 
foyer of a photo processing lab. Thirteen photographs are spread around the 
room, each in a different format: wall-sized murals, window transparencies, 
light-boxes, hand-toned prints. These are accompanied by price sheets, order 
forms, three-ring binders full of sample images and a couch, color-coded to the 
self-consciously spectacular photograph of a Malibu fire hanging above it. 
</P>
<P>
 However witty, "U-Pic-It" takes its place within the increasingly hoary 
tradition of post-Conceptual critique. Over a decade ago, Louise Lawler 
transmuted her New York gallery into a generic model of a bank, complete with 
potted plant and deposit slips. Like Lawler, Hammerness renders absurd the 
debate over whether the gallery is a space of commerce or one of disinterested 
contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, he pinpoints the intellectual bankruptcy of forever wrestling 
with the question of photography's status. If the specifics of the set-up 
deflect us from the fact that none of this is new, other things are compelling 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds of images displayed in the binders encompass a range of 
categories, including "Inanimate Objects," "Studio City Earthquake" and 
"Flowers." Seemingly exhaustive, the choices are actually idiosyncratic. He 
undercuts photography's status as Ur-medium encompassing all others, condensing 
and homogenizing the things of this world so that they fit neatly into its 
archive of images. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there are the images themselves, boasting a mega-watt palette and an eye 
attuned to the well-ripened cliche. A life-sized cut-out of a skate-boarding 
icon, who once sliced across the ground at unimaginably high speed, is here 
congealed into the stuff of product placements. A scene of the empty Colorado 
desert mimics the style of mid-1970s "New Topographers," for whom the most 
extraordinary images were those least marked by the interference of the 
photographer. In Hammerness' version, the artist's shadow is conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammerness is also enamored of earthquakes, fires and other scenes of 
disaster. The irony is that the chaos these images evince contrasts markedly 
with Hammerness' own sure sense of control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sue Spaid Fine Art, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., (213) 935-6153, through Sunday. 
New Meanings: In J. John Priola's small, black-and-white photographs at Paul 
Kopeikin Gallery, such everyday objects as a wishbone, a pacifier and a jewel 
box are imbued with menace, absurdity or melancholy. Some are spotlit as 
harshly as commercial products; others are silhouetted like antique portraits. 
All, however, are isolated within a darkened void, disengaged from any 
narrative, until we begin fabricating narratives for them. It's impossible not 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 If these objects are conceived as clues, the context is cinematic -- all white 
lights and portentous swells of music. If these are mnemonic devices, it is 
therapeutic, as a photograph of a syringe would seem to insist. If these are 
pieces of evidence, the narrative context is juridical and matter-of-fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the only images that jar are those in which matter-of-factness is 
eschewed for symbolism -- such as an egg and an apple. These too easily devolve 
into hackneyed still-life studies, wherein classical beauty overwhelms the 
conceptual program. 
</P>
<P>
 The work as a whole is more ambitious. At the risk of staking a claim too 
grand for images so diminutive, one might argue that they function as 
allegories of the photographic project itself. Photography's mandate is 
demonstrated as clearly as in any textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary things are rendered extraordinary in and through the processes of 
representation (cropping, framing, lighting, etc.). Meaning is conceived as an 
after-effect, a residue of form. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, form is so insistently sculptural it resonates with trickery. 
The objects seem to be winking at us. If trompe-l'oeil painting is uncanny by 
nature, these eccentric photographs redouble its effects. To become absorbed by 
their mundaneness is an unnerving experience.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: VENTURA PIER DINING IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Staff writer Leonard Reed has written before about the Ventura Pier, which is, 
after all, one of the more historically and scenically significant sites in 
this county. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last piece, which ran during the final stages of rebirth, Reed 
chronicled the pier's stormy and fiery history, the massive reconstruction 
effort to restore it and hopes that officials and others had for its glorious 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, several months after the pier's reopening -- and after thousands of 
locals and tourists have made the pilgrimage to see the $3.5-million 
restoration -- Reed is getting down to basics. 
</P>
<P>
 What are we going to eat when we get there? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody prays for a new good restaurant at the pier," Reed said. "And so 
I've been curious about the forces that would choose our beachfront dining 
destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody talks food and restaurants, but few people understand the kind of 
bureaucratic machinations that go into deciding what restaurant should go on a 
piece of public property, how it should get there and who should be paying for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great surprises in reporting this story was in discovering that 
the pier, while offering one of the great restaurant sites in the West, 
actually carries with it economic risk. While dining there seems everyone's 
idea of a great time, it also turns out to be many a restaurant's idea of a 
risky venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, the problem of the pier restaurant begs the oldest question about 
successful restaurants: Do they depend on location, location, location? Or do 
great restaurants draw a loyal following no matter what their situation? In the 
case of the pier, it seems to be a little of both." 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes everything that much more complicated. Should the city of Ventura 
be looking for a corporate partner that will promise excellence in the food, 
overcome parking and demographic obstacles? Or should it go for the biggest 
crowd-pleaser, drawing from locals and tourists alike? 
</P>
<P>
 "Few things are more memorable than a great meal in the last two hours of 
daylight at the beach," Reed said. "Getting the great meal -- even the 
consistently good one -- is the hard part. There's only one pier. There will be 
only one restaurant. It stands to reason that much is at stake in this one 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it will be some time before any of us will get the opportunity to sample 
the catch of the day on the Ventura pier, this might be a good time to check 
out our Food page. Restaurant critic Hilary Dole Klein will tell you about 
eating Italian in Newbury Park, while Tidbits columnist Leo Smith offers some 
clues about eating healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden I'm hungry.

NIGHT LIFE: HOUSE OF GAMES ROCKS WITH R&B; THE HIGH-POWERED SOUNDS ARE THE 
PRODUCT OF SOME VETERAN VENTURA MUSICIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House of Games, once up to six members with dreams of eight and now 
stripped down to a tight quartet, will bring its R&B-powered rock show to 
Garfields, that friendly neighborhood bar in Ventura, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Games is the local equivalent of the house-monikered outfits 
cropping up like condos on farmland. It joins A House, House of Freaks, House 
of Large Sizes, House of Lords, and House of Love in the "H" file. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Games has gone through personnel changes rivaling those on the 
Starship Enterprise. The band appears satisfied with the current lineup of 
Daphne Jones (vocals, keyboards), Roy Jones (guitar), Glade Rasmussen (bass) 
and Donna Eveland (drums). 
</P>
<P>
 The band plays high-powered rock with some bluesy overtones. Roy Jones knocks 
out some tight but abbreviated solos while Daphne Jones has a strong, clear 
rock 'n' roll voice that is up there with any of the famous femmes on MTV. In 
addition to old classics such as "Knock On Wood," the band covers tunes by 
artists as diverse as Omar & the Howlers and Tina Turner, plus a ton of 
originals. They've clearly done this before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daphne and I met 20 years ago -- we've been married for 18 years -- and we've 
probably been in about half a dozen bands over the years," Roy Jones said. "We 
started this band around 1990, and we wanted to do all originals. Now we do a 
50-50 mix of originals, blues and old R&B, Motown, the stuff we love. We do 
rockin' R&B. We're tighter now and this is the most fun of any band we've ever 
been in." 
</P>
<P>
 The band has been hitting the club circuit hard the last few months after a 
layoff. For a while, Eveland went drumming with those rockabilly revivalists, 
the Roadhouse Rockers out of Santa Barbara. And then there was the problem 
afflicting at least 75% of all temporarily inert rock bands -- Need A Bass 
Player. Rasmussen, besides being a great bass player, has his own guitar repair 
shop in Ventura, Glade's World. If you can strum it, you can break it, but 
Rasmussen can fix it. Before that, he toured with Barbara Mandrell, Travis 
Tritt and Reba McEntire as the road guitar technician. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joneses came from Texas but have been here long enough to have lost their 
Texas twang. They ended up in Ventura by accident and got an acoustic gig at 
Eric Ericsson's playing Dan Fogelberg-style songs, and stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not enough places to play in Ventura," Roy Jones said. "We lost the 
Bermuda Triangle and then the Midnight Hour. There's tons of bands with nowhere 
to play. It's just a drag. We need some serious people with some serious cash 
to open a serious club. We need some sort of center in Downtown with a bunch of 
clubs where people can walk or take a cab between them, and where restaurants 
open at night. When the city does something, they seem to think music is 
chamber music. In Santa Barbara, there are so many clubs you can't see all the 
bands in a night." 
</P>
<P>
 House of Games has its name on drum kits and is into its second generation of 
T-shirts, so the band is halfway to rock stardom. The Joneses have no illusions 
about the music biz. Both work at Heck Music in Ventura, where all the local 
musicians spend their cash and spin their sob stories, delusions of grandeur 
and broken MTV dreams, where "almost" and "tomorrow" are the operative words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we work in a music store, we know all the local bands," Roy Jones said. 
"Just about every one of them will tell me something like, 'Tomorrow we're 
going to play for so-and-so.' Then I'll see them six months later and they'll 
tell me, 'Tomorrow we're going to play for so-and-so from whatever record 
company.' I wish any band all the luck in the world. To get signed you have to 
have as much luck as it takes to win the lottery. After we do some recording 
with this four-piece, we'll probably go to L.A., and do the pay-to-play thing. 
What else can you do? We'll have to do whatever else everyone else does -- work 
hard, spend lots of money and try to dodge all the jerks. You've gotta be doing 
this for fun, or else why do it?" Details

ROCK TALK; RAISING THE VOLUME ON RAGING ARBS' RHYTHMS; VENTURA'S RENOWNED PARTY 
BAND RELEASES ITS FIRST NEW RECORDING SINCE 1985 AND CELEBRATES AT THREE 
WEEKEND GIGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Experienced local rock fans may find themselves giving to the bail bondsman of 
their choice: This Memorial Day Weekend it's the Raging Arb & the Redheads' CD 
release party. These local locos will be releasing their first new music since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 And this little tidbit should be enough to give any party animal a case of the 
Premature Whirlies: it's not one CD release party, but three! The first one 
will be Friday night at the venerable Ventura Theatre. It's eminently 
democratic and highly affordable -- it's an all-ages show, and it's free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the first one will be an all-ages show," guitarist Toby Emery said. "We 
don't want this to be just another local rock night. We want to turn all the 
kids on and get a new generation of fans in there. It's their only chance to 
see us because usually we're in bars. It's a big night for us; it's a 
culmination of everything's that gone down before." 
</P>
<P>
 What's gone on before would fill the entire Life section. Suffice to say 
Raging Arb & the Redheads are Ventura's Ultimate Party Band. Kicked out of 
everywhere, blamed for everything and beloved by Venturans, the band will 
celebrate its 11th anniversary July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD, which will cost about 10 bucks, features more than 50 minutes of Arb 
original music -- eight new songs and three old ones made newly gnarly for the 
'90s. The old ones are "Strut," which was on their 1985 album, "Up With The 
Joneses" and "Daze Gone By," a song whose lyrics used to change during 
performances, with Drury making them up on the spot. All of the songs have that 
trademark Arb sound -- rockin' blues with a little twang. Known for beer, 
dancing and more beer, the band has finally concocted a suitable theme song, 
"Corn Licker," which ends the CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, the fun moves up the coast to Toes Tavern, home to 25 
different kinds of beer. For those still standing or not in custody, the party 
concludes at 2 p.m. Sunday at Eric Ericsson's on the beach in Ventura. Opening 
at all three gigs is Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, no slouches in the fun department, 
either; the band recently won three grand at an epic Battle of the Bands 
contest at Metro Bay Club in Ventura. They dress up like they fell out of a 
black and white '40s movie, and they play danceable swing music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another very popular Ventura dance band, Lion I's, will have its CD release 
party at the Ventura Theatre on June 10. The band has had a couple of tapes, 
but finally has a full-length CD that will contain all their biggies with the 
proper mix -- including "I'm So Poor," "Sweet Summer" and "Closer." It'll cost 
12 bucks to get into this show, but the CDs are free. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two happening local dance bands -- Ska Daddyz and Big Bad Voodoo 
Daddy -- are both in the studio working on their own CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They Come, They Go, But Mostly They Go Department: Ventura has lost three 
venues, and the year's not even half over. The Bermuda Triangle went away for 
New Year's, and last weekend Club Deja Vu in Montalvo and the Midnight Hour in 
West Ventura became history. The phone number for the manager and Club Deja Vu 
(an all-ages no booze dance club) are both disconnected -- a bad sign -- and 
alas, Montalvo rocks no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Midnight Hour is also in the past tense after its long goodby scenario 
concluded with the third and final show Saturday night. Owner Larry Burdorf, 
who had enough fun in the last year to swear off gainful employment for good, 
says he is "actively seeking another venue." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more positive note, Nicholby's in Ventura is a viable venue and Eric 
Ericsson's, at the end of Seaward Avenue in Ventura, reopened this year after 
being closed several years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Shameful Hype Department: Did anybody go see Phish at the Arlington 
Theatre in Santa Barbara a few weeks ago? Yikes, those guys are great. That's 
about the best show I've seen in years. Four virtuoso musicians, a zillion 
original songs, and a fan network that numbers more than 50,000. Their new 
album, "Hoist," is highly recommended.

THEATER REVIEW; NEW 'NUNSENSE' ARRIVES WITH ITS CHARMS INTACT; THE 
ACTOR-FRIENDLY TWEAKING OF CATHOLICISM HASN'T WORN OUT ITS WELCOME IN THIS, THE 
LATEST VERSION TO HIT THE AREA. 
</P>

 The Little Sisters of Hoboken aren't the flying variety of nun played by Sally 
Field in the vintage television series. But they might as well be, the way 
they've been moving about Ventura County the last few months, taking over the 
bodies of various sets of actors in a multiplicity of productions of Dan 
Goggin's musical revue, "Nunsense." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest, and easternmost, local manifestation opened last weekend at the 
Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly, the show is Goggin's representation of a fund-raising talent show put 
on by the Little Sisters, in which the author pokes good-natured fun at Roman 
Catholic ritual. It's a natural for community theater: only a small cast is 
required, and they don't have to be very good -- after all, the nuns are 
amateurs. Even if, as here, the members of the cast are talented, the job 
offers showy roles calling for them to act as if amateurs, to what many people 
consider comic effect. A theater group can hardly lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most interesting aspect of "Nunsense" is how different groups can 
put their own imprint on it, adding their own shameless puns and otherwise 
tailoring the production. (It would be nice, then, if someone were to dispose 
of the dated references -- like the impersonation of Katharine Hepburn's 
60-year-old "the calla lilies are in bloom again" speech; the now-pointless 
quote from "Gypsy" -- or the sloppy writing: Ed McMahon represents the American 
Family Sweepstakes, not Publishers' Clearing House). 
</P>
<P>
 While this and the fine (and more audience-involving) version closing Saturday 
in Oxnard draw from the same script, they are different enough that it's almost 
worthwhile -- but only for devoted fans of the show -- to see both. For the 
casually interested, one will be quite enough. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for those in the environs of Simi Valley, the Soap Box Players' version 
has much to recommend it, including a spirited, talented cast and a backstage 
four-piece band. (The Oxnard production uses what sounds like taped musical 
backing; last fall's Ojai show featured an onstage pianist, dressed -- like the 
singers -- as a nun.) 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Simi Valley show's actors cite extensive professional stage and 
TV credits: Mary Harper as Mother Superior, Jacquelyn Levy as an earthy Sister 
Mary Hubert, and Denise Jaffe as ambitious Brooklynite Sister Robert Ann. More 
familiar to local audiences is Sharon Gibson as ditzy Sister Mary Amnesia, 
so-called because she's forgotten her name. Newcomer Shana Levy (apparently no 
kin to Jacquelyn) plays novice and aspiring ballerina-for-God Sister Mary Leo. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was co-directed by Roy Spicer III and Dani Brown; he doubles as 
musical director and pianist, and she as choreographer. Spicer's band also 
includes synthesist Edgardo Pena, percussionist Michael Rosen and Sean 
Stackpoole on woodwinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up: "Nunsense II" in Ojai, opening June 17. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Nunsense. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. through June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center, 3190 Cochran St., Simi Valley. 
</P>

WORDS & IMAGES: REVOLUTIONARY POET GINSBERG TO MAKE VENTURA APPEARANCE; THE 
AWARD-WINNING MAN OF LETTERS STILL QUESTIONS GOVERNMENTS IN HIS NEW COLLECTION 
OF POEMS, 'COSMOPOLITAN GREETINGS.'

 Allen Ginsberg. Even if you've never read his poems, you think, "Isn't he that 
beat generation guy, the one who with fellow writers Jack Kerouac, William S. 
Burroughs, Gregory Corso and Peter Orlovsky began kicking dirt in Establishment 
faces almost 50 years ago?" If you do know his work -- the photography books, 
the music, the poems -- among them "Howl," initially banned in America as 
obscene, and "Kaddish," inspired by his tragic, psychotic mother -- you 
acknowledge him as a revolutionary presence, a disconcerting basher of the 
status quo, and also a deservedly honored, award-winning, revered man of 
letters. A man, who, incidentally, was cited in the 1960s as a "dangerous 
radical" by both the Czech Communist government and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old Ginsberg, is still celebrating life (particularly as he 
experiences it on New York's Lower East Side) and challenging governments in 
his new collection of poems, "Cosmopolitan Greetings," written between 1986 and 
1992, and just published by Harper / Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be appearing locally at one place, and one place only -- at the 
Ventura Bookstore, 522 E. Main St., 11:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A phenomena in the publishing world is the escalating value of first editions 
written by a number of new novelists. For example, according to Audrey Moore of 
Mysteries to Die For, Sandra Prowell's first book, "By Evil Means," which 
introduced the character Phoebe Siegel, a half-Jewish / half-Catholic private 
investigator, is now worth more than $50. Prowell will sign a sequel, "The 
Killing of Monday Brown," at 1 p.m. today at the bookstore, 2940 Thousand Oaks 
Blvd., Thousand Oaks. So check your bookshelves. If you own a first edition of 
Sue Grafton's "A Is for Alibi" or Robert James Waller's "The Bridges of Madison 
County," you already own a valuable collector's item.

CENTERPIECE: SENT REELING; VENTURA DANGLED THE BAIT, A PRIME SPOT FOR A 
RESTAURANT ON THE REMODELED PIER. ONLY FOUR OUT OF 80 ENTERED BIDS. WHY THE 
LACK OF INTEREST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who ever loved to cook and to dine well has had the fantasy of opening 
a restaurant. Anyone who has explored the possibility has learned that to do so 
requires much money, 80-hour-a-week dedication and the high risk of failure, 
closure, even bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, restaurants are held dear by many, and news of openings or closings 
always makes for hot discussion. Venturans have been eagerly awaiting the 
announcement by city officials of who will open a restaurant at one of the 
prime dining locations in the West: the newly restored Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Much would be at stake, however, in the selection of such a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's newest restaurant would not only serve food but act as an important 
nexus: for residents, overnight tourists, day-tripping beach-goers, business 
people, the L.A.-to-Santa Barbara weekend crowd. Depending on how attractive it 
is in food and setting, the new restaurant would either help or hinder in 
shoring up businesses in an aging downtown split from its beaches by a roaring 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would either please or distress residents who chronically complain that 
there just aren't enough good restaurants in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, over a year ago, it seemed Ventura would be in the catbird's 
seat -- able to choose carefully from a clamorous crowd of eager, proven 
entrepreneurs. The site always promised that. It's a 6,000-square-foot 
rectangle of space on the Ventura Pier -- the only free-standing beachfront 
property available in Ventura for a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 And waterfront dining has held the imagination of developers and diners for 
decades around America's perimeter. Something about salt air, the peacefulness 
of water and island views, the belief that fish on the plate was pulled that 
day from a stone's throw away, the postcard quality of brightly colored 
sailboats -- it all lends a special dimension to the dining experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal communities everywhere have always managed, on beaches or docks or 
piers or stilts or barges, to erect popular, profitable fish houses of some 
kind: Backwater crawfish shacks dot Louisiana's bayou; dining gardens with palm 
trees line the gulf beaches of the Florida Keys; Southstreet Seaport in New 
York transforms a west bank of the East River into a multitiered dining 
fantasy; Baltimore Harbor virtually sinks beneath the weight of Chesapeake Bay 
crab emporiums; Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco is where tourists go first 
to line up for steamers, and Southern California's coastline is a happy 
hodgepodge of sea-view restaurants ranging from nautical kitsch to strictly 
uptown. 
</P>
<P>
 But not in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, things have proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody, it turns out, wants to open a restaurant on the pier, despite 
the pier's meticulous restoration only a year ago at a cost of $3.5 million. 
Despite unobstructed views to the Channel Islands. Despite a potential monopoly 
market on a beach-going crowd estimated at more than 1.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, city officials are scheduled to close negotiations with a Seattle 
developer, Hal Griffith, who runs a chain of nautically themed restaurants 
called The Fisherman's Galley, two of them on piers in San Clemente and Newport 
Beach (see accompanying restaurant review). Griffith's was one of only four 
proposals submitted after Ventura's invitation to more than 80 parties to 
consider the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 That lackluster response prompts some to wonder whether Ventura could have 
done better, could have thrown a larger net for candidates, could have marketed 
its prized site more successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're frustrated," says Councilman Greg Carson. "I expected more proposals. 
We were hoping that word of mouth would go out, that more people would be aware 
of it. It's a special site. Where else can you do something like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Byerts, the city administrator who oversees the selection, sighs deeply 
and blames the economy. "Why no fever of competition? It's real simple: They 
can't get loans. They can't get the money to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisherman's Galley may well win the site, and that would please members of a 
selection committee from Ventura who dined at the San Clemente Fisherman's 
Galley and were happy with the experience. Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle was 
among the dining delegates and said, "I really liked it. It's just what I had 
in mind for the pier." 
</P>
<P>
 But Griffith's negotiations with the city -- over whether the city will bear 
part or all of the cost of constructing a restaurant shell on the pier, as well 
as the terms of a lease -- are anything but certain in the outcome, and the 
result could be a whole new search for a whole new restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, key questions remain as to why Ventura has been unable 
to attract a large number of restaurant candidates for its much-loved historic 
pier. And the questions inevitably invoke broader factors that affect 
restaurant performance: tourism, the level of spending in Ventura restaurants, 
and the ability of residents and visitors to freely move from downtown shops to 
the beach and the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 All factors help determine the success or failure of a restaurant. Yet all are 
problems only recently receiving sustained attention in Ventura. On the Lower 
End 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Duckett of Palo Alto is among the restaurateurs who chose not to submit a 
proposal for the Ventura Pier. Duckett runs the highly successful and 
well-reviewed Fishmarket Restaurants in Northern California and Arizona, and he 
knows these parts well from his swordfishing days out of Channel Islands 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pier is a fair location," he says matter-of-factly. "I looked at the 
(city's) proposal briefly. But we do excellent locations only, and look closely 
at per-capita spending. Ventura is a lower-end market, say, than Santa Barbara, 
and it strikes me as more transient. Then, there was a short deadline for 
sealed bids, and, well, we just don't do business that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Strand runs the respected Scott's Seafood restaurants in San 
Francisco, San Jose and Sacramento. He echoed the comments of Duckett and 
numerous other restaurateurs who received invitations but turned the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just not enough going on in that market," Strand says. "I spoke to a 
friend who lives there to check it out, and I can tell by having visited, as 
well -- there's no action. And I would have to add that, upon investigation, it 
turns out to be a fairly low-end market." 
</P>
<P>
 Low end. If Ventura incomes are lower than Santa Barbara's, does that still 
mean that a fine restaurant can't do well in Ventura? Rosarito Beach Cafe and 
The Chart House, to name just two that are quite respectable in their food and 
not exactly low in their pricing, prove the opposite to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 So what else thwarted the search? 
</P>
<P>
 The document that was sent to Duckett, Strand and more than 80 others is 
called a Request for Proposals (RFP). It went through three drafts in an effort 
to make the pier site more enticing. Still, Ventura's RFP for the pier 
restaurant was a demanding document that presumed much about Ventura's 
restaurant marketplace and the considerable burdens any new pier restaurateur 
might bear. 
</P>
<P>
 It stated that Ventura wanted "a new upscale premier restaurant facility" from 
a developer who "would be responsible for the construction of the restaurant 
shell and all tenant improvements" on the pier. The successful candidate, it 
went on, would install "public art at a minimum of 2% of the project cost" and 
"provide concession management and operation services for (a) snack bar and 
bait shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Launching a restaurant these days is tough enough. But after investing heavily 
in such construction, the pier restaurateur would not own anything; instead, he 
or she would have a 10-year lease from the city to rent the space, open to 
renewal by renegotiation only. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the four who did submit proposals ignored the city's demands. Each sought 
partnership of some kind -- a sharing of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were we too restrictive? We were, at first," says Councilman Carson. "But all 
those who did propose had creative solutions, and all had (the city) involved 
in building the shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson pauses a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a learning experience. We didn't know what was out there. If we 
wind up doing it all over again, do we make it clear that (the city) would 
build the restaurant shell? We need to consider these things carefully, because 
we're not in the (restaurant) business." (The 10-year-lease clause is the least 
flexible of the city's demands, however -- it is stipulated by the Ventura City 
Charter.) Shaky Assumptions 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing "what's out there," as Carson put it, is a key point in two respects. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the field of potential candidates was delimited by the city of 
Ventura's grasp of the restaurant world. For the most part, it invited only 
those whom it knew or considered, based on regional reputation, to be worthy -- 
brief advertisements in the Los Angeles Times business section notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, many of the assumptions and expectations brought to the search by 
Ventura officials are rooted in a 1989 restaurant feasibility study that cited 
pent-up demand for waterfront dining and rosily projected annual growth in 
Ventura restaurant spending through 1994. Indeed, the RFP itself cites the 
study, by Williams-Kuebelbeck and Associates, as showing "sufficient demand for 
a dinner restaurant in this trade area to support approximately 10,000 square 
feet of additional restaurant space." 
</P>
<P>
 But the opposite has happened: Restaurants in both Ventura and Channel Islands 
Harbors have had difficulty in recent years -- some have closed and vacancies 
remain -- and per-capita restaurant spending throughout the city of Ventura, 
state tax files show, declined more than 8% by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Byerts says he drew up the RFP invitation list with help from the city's 
redevelopment staff, which "targeted, by looking through trade journals, those 
companies that had strategies into which a pier restaurant might fit." These 
firms, such as Duckett's and Stroud's, are joined by numerous Ventura and 
Oxnard individuals who had simply expressed an interest -- people such as Ed 
Warren, original owner of The Busy Bee cafe and current owner of Smokey's 
Saloon, both in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But firms such as the Maryland-based Rouse Corp., creator of both Baltimore 
Harbor and New York's South Street Seaport and respected worldwide as perhaps 
the leading developer of waterfront dining, went uninvited. Rouse also has done 
work on a much smaller scale in California, such as the inventive and extremely 
popular food court at Santa Monica's 3rd Street Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why such contenders were not contacted, Byerts replied: "I really 
couldn't answer you. It has to do with no one really knowing a lot of the big 
firms. We figured the ad in the L.A. Times would hit that." 
</P>
<P>
 The optimistic 1989 study predicted that "additional demand for dinner 
restaurants in Ventura will be generated by new residents." 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1989, at the time the study was written, 259 permits were issued to 
Ventura dining establishments for an annual gross sales of $98.6 million. Three 
years later, in 1992, the last full year for which figures are available from 
the state Board of Equalization, 260 permits were issued for an annual gross 
sale of $100.4 million -- growth so marginal that, once Ventura's 2.5% 
population increase is taken into account, it actually represents an 8.4% 
decline in per-capita restaurant spending. First-quarter figures for 1993, the 
latest quarterly figures reported, look even bleaker: The number of restaurant 
permits in Ventura had slipped to 257. 
</P>
<P>
 To put the best face on it, Ventura restaurants -- some closing, but others 
opening and doing so well as to displace the losses of others -- had proudly 
held their own through a tough recession. But Ventura plainly showed no growth 
in its restaurant economy in the three years following the 1989 study -- 
contrasted with increases of 10.7% in Simi Valley and 4.1% in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the concept of pent-up demand for waterfront dining remains just 
that: an appealing concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 study, finally, argued that any new pier restaurant would generate 
60% of its trade from tourists or visitors -- a figure that runs counter to 
current experience at some of Ventura's high-end, near-the-beach 
establishments. The Chart House, which offers ocean views from its perch on a 
bluff on Sanjon Road, has a clientele that is roughly 35% tourists, says Brian 
Brennan, the restaurant's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 It is worth noting that The Chart House, for all its popularity and consistent 
quality, is open for dinner only, never for lunch or brunch -- that's simply 
what the Ventura market will bear. "It's pretty local," says Brennan. "I spend 
all Friday and Saturday nights walking around kissing babies and shaking hands 
with the locals. It's just good business." 
</P>
<P>
 An RFP was sent to Brennan, but The Chart House declined to bid for the pier 
site. "The numbers weren't there for us," says Brennan, who also serves as vice 
president of the Ventura Chamber of Commerce and chairs its subcommittee on 
tourism. "We just didn't see the number of people we'd need walking by." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful spot," he continued. "I've had people in the industry call 
me about it, and I've encouraged them, but the numbers weren't there for them, 
either." Not Yet a 'Destination' 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism is always invoked in arguments about the vitality of Ventura's 
restaurant economy. But the methods of calculating the numbers and types of 
tourists are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura reports that it had 1,531,817 day visitors in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 To arrive at that figure, however, it uses a state-recommended "multiplier" of 
2.17, which is multiplied by the number of overnight leisure visitors as 
reported by Ventura hotels and motels. The multiplier, created by state 
planners who did not focus on beachfront concentrations exclusively, is used in 
beachless Fresno and off-the-beaten-track Indio. So Ventura, loved for its 
beaches bisected by the busy 101, very likely has more day-trippers that it 
knows or reports, concedes Debbie Solomon of the city's public information 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The less-than-happy news is that Ventura may not be the tourist destination it 
believes itself to be. Destination implies staying overnight, at times for many 
nights on a vacation, and that's where things get sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Devlin Raley, an advertising executive of the firm Creative Images, is 
chairing the city's newly formed Tourism and Special Events Committee, which 
will seek to coordinate efforts among the city, the Visitors and Convention 
Bureau, the state-affiliated Ventura Fairgrounds and Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Raley is a rampant, unabashed Ventura booster. But his gift is holding a hard, 
clear eye on realities: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our overwhelming majority of overnight visitors (91.8%) are staying only a 
day or two, and we need to increase that to three or four. We have problems 
getting people around -- from the harbor to the beach to downtown to Surfers 
Point. We also have parking problems -- if you come here, where do you go? 
We're just not focused on what tourism really is to us. We have work to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we selling anyway? Until we define ourselves to the regional market, 
we just won't be happening. Let's stop saying we're a destination resort until 
we become one." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Raley has a sense of the Ventura Pier's role in all this: 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help close that loop with downtown, which is revitalizing. Putting an 
appropriate restaurant there is key. If it's too upscale, we'll be defeating 
the personality of that pier and reduce usage of it by local residents. And the 
truth is, our business community must survive 12 months of the year, and 
tourism is really only four months of it." Retro Rejected 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three unsuccessful restaurant proposals came from the popular retro 
1940s chain Ruby's. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Cavanaugh, who represents Ruby's, is disappointed. "We've wanted to be in 
Ventura a long time," he says. "It fits our profile: younger families and 
retirees. It's us. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I do feel that people who are walking to a pier are not dressed up and 
already have chosen not to make a big deal over dining. History shows that more 
upscale places in this setting are less successful than the casual, and I 
believe history will prove us right." 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Griffith, who declined to be interviewed while in negotiations with the 
city, did say his firm is considering reducing the ambition and price of its 
entrees at its Newport Beach restaurant. The Fisherman's Galley is at the far 
end of the pier, requiring diners to make the long seaward walk. That, Griffith 
said, tends to attract an even more casual crowd. Downscaling the menu to fish 
and chips is being considered. He said he didn't feel that that would be the 
case in Ventura, which would want the more upscale menu (see pricing in 
accompanying article). 
</P>
<P>
 The two others who were passed over have different views of the city's 
approach to finding a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Janss of the Janss Development Corp., a former partner in the old Pier 
Fish House at the pier, pitched a seafood restaurant with entrees from $12 to 
$19 and an on-site micro-brewery as a special draw, particularly for the slower 
midweek crowd. But he concedes: "The whole problem of traffic and demography 
was making me a bit nervous, and my last years at the pier, with gangs and a 
shooting, had caused me some concern. So I was not in deep despair when I 
wasn't selected." 
</P>
<P>
 Jana Johnson, however, a broker representing the Reel Inn chain, is perplexed 
with the city's handling of applicants. Johnson said that Reel, whose nearest 
restaurant overlooks the water in Malibu, took the proposal quite seriously, 
submitted a 55-page document that included a conceptual site plan and 
architect's rendering, and considered itself a perfect solution for Ventura in 
that it offered both inexpensive, casual dining as well as pricey, ambitious 
dining for those who wished a special night out. But the city never responded, 
says Johnson, not even to say that Reel had lost out. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client read it in the paper," says Johnson. "That's a slap in the face. 
The city's not taking the time to interview us -- that surprised us. But no 
notification? I would have to hesitate and think whether I'd want to put a 
client through that process again." 
</P>
<P>
 Byerts rejects Johnson's claims outright. "That's just not accurate," he says. 
"We sent notification of whom we selected." But news of Griffith's selection 
may have been publicly discussed by a councilman before notices were received, 
he acknowledged. Facing Financial Burden 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever gets the pier site faces tremendous upfront costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Byerts estimates that it would take $1.5 million to $2 million to build, 
furnish, staff and open a restaurant at the pier. Then it would take as much -- 
$1.5 million a year -- in gross receipts to pay the bills, with profitability a 
good two years of operation away. (Note: The Pier Fish House, less than half 
the size of any proposed new restaurant, showed gross annual revenues in its 
final years of operation of about $750,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 Who will take on such costs -- particularly when the market continues to lack 
definition, though restaurateurs do report gains in business in recent months 
-- remains unclear. Also unclear is how far the city of Ventura will go toward 
building a shell, improving the empty lot between the pier and the Holiday Inn 
parking garage, and launching a people-moving transportation system, such as a 
trolley, that links downtown and Ventura's multiple waterfronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Griffith of Seattle may know. He has built on many a pier, sold many a 
plate of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But if for some reason he wriggles off the hook, Ventura will to have to cast 
about all over again -- and this time with new soundings, new bait.

FLIP-FLOP FARE, GREAT VIEWS AT THE GALLEY; RESTAURANT: VISIT NETS MIXED A BAG, 
WITH A DELECTABLE APPETIZER, ONE FRESH-FISH FAILURE AND ONE SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The two-story Fisherman's Galley here is situated at the very end of this 
city's pier, affording it unobstructed 360-degree water views. Perhaps 25% of 
the total dining space is devoted to outdoor, patio-style dining with overhead 
heaters to repel cool ocean breezes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected that a Fisherman's Galley situated on Ventura's pier would have 
at least as much, and probably much more, outdoor dining to maximize views. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fisherman's interior design and ambience are calculated in every detail to 
evoke the Pacific Northwest maritime life: brass ship's fixtures set off by 
dark-stained wainscoted walls, framed black-and-white prints of old salts in 
myriad seafaring poses, dining tables into which thick docking rope has been 
embedded by clear acrylic, a young heave-ho! staff dressed uniformly in blue 
polo shirts bearing the restaurant's embroidered insignia. If you've never been 
to Seattle, then it may as well be quaint Bar Harbor, Maine -- in any event, 
the place is not dressed in California pastels. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd is strictly local and casual, shorts and sneakers and sport shirts 
the prevailing dress, with nary a necktie or dress in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is focused yet extensive, with mesquite-grilled fish and shellfish 
entrees -- salmon, halibut, prawns, scallops, shark, sea bass -- starting at 
$14.95, though during the month of May a special was featured in which grilled 
salmon or baked cod was available at $8.95 between 4 and 6 p.m. The high end 
tops out with fresh Alaskan king crab for $19.95 and Dungeness crab for $17.95. 
Pastas, such as smoked salmon tossed with fettuccine and garlic cream, start at 
$13.95. All meals include salad or chowder; rice pilaf, steak fries or baked 
potato, and a sourdough roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Results in a recent visit were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dinner, upstairs at the bar, a special appetizer of smoked albacore was 
perfect: moist, deeply and richly flavored, generous in the portion and an 
uncommon bargain (under $2) during happy hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs, for dinner, appetizers weren't quite as successful. Seafood 
chowder (included), a tomatoey broth with miniature shrimp of the canned or 
frozen variety and overcooked chunks of chewy swordfish, flopped. Zucchini 
sticks ($4.95) were fresh, properly fried, though a tad wan from standard ranch 
dressing for dipping sauce. House salad (included) was plain old iceberg 
lettuce with some Romaine tossed in everyday, viscous, commercial-grade Italian 
dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish of the day was fresh sea bass ($14.95), which arrived in troublesome 
shape. The filet was a thin, small (under 5 inches) tailpiece, less than 
sparklingly fresh, and cooked on an overheated grill that toughened its 
exterior and left interior portions undercooked. Flavorless and old, it went 
largely uneaten. The accompanying baked potato was fine. But an accompanying 
glass of Beringer Chardonnay was also old, somewhat oxidized and resupplied 
with a just-opened and tightly knit Callaway Calla-Lees Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiter was summoned on the subject of the sea bass. Feigning double 
hunger, I asked him to choose for me a fish filet that would be the best in the 
house: that-day fresh, nicely cut, handled properly on the grill. He cheerfully 
brought forth a large center-cut filet of mahi mahi ($15.95) that was perfect: 
nicely grilled outside, cooked just enough within to preserve juices and 
natural delicate flavors. This was served with an excellent, deeply flavorful 
rice pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyday diners don't dine twice, of course, and so my real regret about 
dinner was that the waiter, a cheerful fellow in every way, hadn't offered 
useful counsel in getting the most basic of dishes right the first time: fresh 
fish. But perhaps batting averages are higher in other foods here. 
</P>
<P>
 Much ado is made on the menu about steamed clams by the bucket and specialties 
called Fisherman's Feasts, which start at $15.95 per person for two or more 
diners and feature such combinations as bread, salad, chowder, steamed clams 
and fillet of Alaskan cod in lemon butter sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, this article cannot be considered a full review of the 
Fisherman's Galley, as it represents one anonymous visit.

SIGHTS; EXHIBIT PUTS 3-D ART IN FAVORABLE LIGHT; THE SHOW AT ART CITY GALLERY 
IN VENTURA OFFERS A RANGE OF SCULPTURES -- FROM THE WHIMSICAL TO THE SYMBOLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Art City Gallery is Ventura's equivalent of a cultural factory outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk beyond the "City's" fence and you're greeted by evidence of art-making 
industry. Piles of precious stone are strewn about the yard, ready for the 
altering thwacks of chisels. Resident artists work with sculptures in various 
states of completion. 
</P>
<P>
 And the exhibition in the Art City Gallery, "Spring Exposure," provides a neat 
and logical sense of closure to the experience of a visit. Sculptural work 
usually makes some presence in the shows put on in this gallery. This time 
around, the accent is on three-dimensional works and the variety of expressions 
possible under the heading. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Giblin's "Split," if not the most striking piece in the show, may be the 
most symbolically and thematically fitting. In this definitive 
work-in-progress, a nude figure struggles to break free of the large slab 
holding her future. But that future, by conventional standards, has been 
canceled, frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the few 2-D works lean toward physicality. John Forbes' lunar-lit 
Cibachrome photographs exert an almost super-real presence. Craggy, 
snow-flecked mountain subjects in discriminating half-light tie in with the 
nature of the stone sculptures on view. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra Moroscos' "Abstract Figure Studies," too, resonate with the 
sculptural denizens in the gallery. They are rough-hewn, gnarled, improbable 
anatomies. 
</P>
<P>
 Her impressive construction "Skins" is a study-in-contrasts. Dried pieces of 
animal hide, hung from a rusty metal apparatus, hold an amorphous hunk of 
marble resembling a slab of meat. Beyond the odd sensuality of its materials, 
the piece registers as an indictment of the meat industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals -- and suggestions thereof -- figure into other works here, including 
Matt Harvey's relief piece, "Yard Dog II," a whimsical mutt image in mosaic 
form, and Frank Lauran's "Light at the Bottom of the Sea," whose sculptural 
tentacles take on a loony evocation of undersea life. 
</P>
<P>
 Human figures arrive in varying states. Kim Harvey's "Dreamer" is a distorted, 
slender nude, lyrically rendered, while Paco Robles' "Grandfather" is a figure 
reduced to featureless geometric modules. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Donadio's "Calvin" contains a strange power of appeal, with its rough, 
stacked marble slabs piled into a twisted hint of a figurative, gravity-defying 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 Relegated to the back of the room -- actually, the most highlighted spot in 
the gallery -- we find a selection of works by Doug Lipton, Ventura's Found 
Object King. Lipton, no doubt a frequenter of old-town Ventura's famed thrift 
shop-antique-junk row, is wont to collect gaudy "found" materials and enshrine 
them in artworks, often deploying cheesy puns to complete the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipton's shrine, in this case, centers around a large painted panel, the 
quasi-erotic "Zebagirls" (like something out of the credits of a James Bond 
movie). "Gam Vases," flower vases made out of overturned, black-stocking-clad 
mannequin legs, flanks the panel, along with chintzy furniture refinished and 
bequeathed with importance by association. 
</P>
<P>
 Another kind of leg -- a prosthetic one, holding a blue light bulb -- is the 
main object in "Artificialite." Cleverness and resourcefulness are their own 
rewards here. As he often does, Lipton gives new meaning and new life to the 
word cheap . 
</P>

 The Art City Gallery is a unique and ever-inviting enclave in the area's 
wavering art scene. Literally off-the-beaten-path, nestled against the Ventura 
River on the city's outskirts, the gallery remains one of Ventura's most 
valuable subcultural suburbs. BANKING ON IT 
</P>
<P>
 Painter Carlisle Cooper's works -- skewed portraits of government and 
religious leaders, hunters, soldiers, romantic views of artists and poets, and 
spacey, kitschy abstractions -- are scattered liberally throughout the Ventura 
County National Bank in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed as a dizzying whole, the artist's work sends out wildly mixed messages. 
Such paintings as "The Prince" and other portraits of iconic authority figures 
whose surfaces are smudged and blurred seem to dethrone and demystify men of 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 But his sickly palette and tendency to emulate stained-glass window or 
papier-mache effects link him more closely to Leroy Neiman than Francis Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more blatantly bothersome note, paintings of the artist with a model are 
downright creepy, sullied by unseemly macho posturing (or did we miss the 
satirical element again?) The artist is seen as a gallant poetic warrior, 
gazing reflectively into the distance, while his nude model stares with a 
come-hither look. 
</P>
<P>
 Another small work is a portrait of a "Girl Surfer," although it sure looks 
like a woman to me. 
</P>
<P>
 A much less ambivalent response is generated by Emil Lazarevich's crudely 
charming sculptures. These chunky miniatures mimic the effects and physical 
properties of concrete as well as sand castle-architecture, a connection made 
literal in "Shore Figures and Jetsam." Details

ROUNDUP: COUNTRY-WESTERN THEMES LASSO THE PARTY CROWD; THEY ARE WINNING 
POPULARITY FOR EVENTS AS DIVERSE AS WEDDINGS, ANNIVERSARIES AND COLLEGE 
HOMECOMINGS.

 My favorite scene in the film "Urban Cowboy" is when Debra Winger's Texas 
tomboy character, Sissy, models her wedding dress. Her mother exclaims how 
lovely she looks. Sissy responds by hitching up her bridal gown to reveal white 
cowboy boots as she complains, "But Mama, my legs are sweating." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, that incongruous picture struck me as bizarre. But these days the 
appearance of the country-Western theme in everything from weddings to bar 
mitzvahs is becoming commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, K-HAY radio has been holding "Country Celebrations" as 
advertising promotions as well as community fund-raising events to benefit 
causes including Future Farmers of America, Toys for Tots, and the recent Red 
Cross Earthquake Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, the idea has caught on with the public. In addition to 
country-Western weddings and birthday parties, you'll see Cal Lutheran 
University's homecoming this October go country. And corporate country events 
are the rage at the Ojai Valley Inn's refurbished barn at nearby scenic Rancho 
Dos Rios. 
</P>
<P>
 According to marketing director Alison Brainard, the response has been 
overwhelming since the barn opened two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent group of Canadian chemists were having so much fun that they 
requested overtime, Brainard said. I guess they don't see a lot of Tush Push in 
Saskatchewan. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction of country-Western for many hosts is the chance to introduce 
guests to a new experience. That appeals to many charitable groups and clubs. 
For example, in August more than 300 guests helped the 40-Leaguers club to 
raise money for medical equipment and scholarships by attending a hoedown at 
the Maulhardt barn in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, most of the 50 people at the annual "Boss's Night" party of 
the Ventura County Medical Secretaries and Assistants organization had never 
line danced. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it on TV a lot and hear about," Janette Lofing said. "But I hadn't 
done it yet. And we had a wonderful time. Juan from the Crazy Bull taught and 
supplied the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all the women bring their husbands," she added. "So one reason we chose 
line dancing was they could still dance without having a partner." 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code at these shindigs varies. Most uninitiated folks show up in 
denim, calico and red neckerchiefs -- a sure sign it's their first encounter 
with a country-Western party. But that's OK. Fashion can be learned. But it's 
not good to be clueless when planning the event and its components. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on your needs, you'll probably want music, a line dance instructor, 
a proper setting and a tri-tip barbecue. Some people even rent props, an old 
movie set or ranch location and a carriage or related equine transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can start small. For example, one friend in Camarillo built a memorable 
Halloween party around 20 guests and a deejay who hosted country karaoke in the 
living room. And an Ojai couple recently celebrated their 10th wedding 
anniversary by repeating their vows at a winery, then dancing to a live country 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 While a country-Western theme party is novelty entertainment for some folks, 
many fans of country music and dance naturally go that route for even the most 
important occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Boverson and Jonathan Hicks exchanged vows in the yard of her Ojai 
home last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The groom wore a Western shirt, bolo tie and black cowboy boots. The bride 
chose white, laced-covered high-heeled boots to complement her off-the-shoulder 
gown. And cowboy hats for guests were optional. But all 240 people got down and 
boogied to post-nuptial line dancing in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a live band and a line dance instructor there if people wanted to 
learn how to dance. We thought it would be a lot of fun, more relaxed and 
easier to plan. That's what a wedding should be about -- celebrating," said 
Deborah Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, it was inexpensive. That way you can use the money toward your 
honeymoon." 
</P>
<P>
 * FASHION: Country-Western wedding attire is catching on. 25 Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For one-stop shopping for bands, call Local 581, the American 
Federation of Musicians Union, 643-9953. For line dance instructors and 
deejays, contact Ojai-based J.R. Productions, 646-1679, or Country Events to 
Remember consultants, Ed and Sally, in Moorpark, 523-1038. Also, see the yellow 
pages under "musicians" and "caterers." For specific dance instructors, contact 
your local country nightspot for a referral.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; 'THREESOME' EVOKES HOSTILE RESPONSE; WITNESSES 
SAY HOMOPHOBIC INSULTS WERE SHOUTED DURING THE MOVIE, WHICH REVOLVES AROUND A 
LOVE 'TRIANGLE' AMONG TWO MEN AND A WOMAN.

 Homophobes in the audience at the Mann Buenaventura were scandalized at a 
recent showing of "Threesome." 
</P>
<P>
 The sexual coming-of-age movie that one reviewer described as "Three's 
Company" with a case of hot monkey love, revolves around three college 
students, two men and a woman, involved in a love triangle. 
</P>
<P>
 This triangle is truly an equilateral one. He's hot for her. She's hot for the 
other, but the other is hot for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Charles plays the role of Eddy, a sensitive young man, which in the 
Hollywood parlance generally equates to sexual confusion. His question mark 
comes in the form of Stephen Baldwin, who plays a jock with a crush on their 
female roommate, Lara Flynn Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that 20 minutes into the film several male audience members 
started yelling "homo" and "fag" and, although there is no man-on-man sex in 
the film, one butt-grab sent some outraged male viewers cussing and fuming from 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 15 minutes left in the film, one man, unable to retain a tolerant 
attitude any longer, reportedly sprang from his chair saying, "Oh my God, I 
can't stand this anymore" and bolted. 
</P>

<P>
 "Indochine" is the Vietnam film Oliver Stone would have made if he were in 
touch with his feminine side. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of a French colonial plantation owner in Southeast Asia is a woman's 
picture in the way "Gone With the Wind" was a woman's picture. Both have strong 
female characters who personify the decline of a system that's luxurious for a 
few, while cruel to the many. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Deneuve plays the plantation owner who lives in a Maugham-esque 
colonial paradise during a time of growing anti-colonial spirit. The film 
builds as the fate of an increasingly strife-torn country becomes intertwined 
with the personas of Deneuve and her adopted Vietnamese daughter, who are in 
love with the same man. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Film Society is featuring "Indochine" as its Sunday film. The 
screening is set for 4:30 p.m. at the Ojai Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai Ave. 
Admission is $6. 
</P>

<P>
 Century Theaters are screening an advertisement for mature audiences only. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain's Century 8 Theater is playing a political ad for Frank Navarette, a 
candidate hoping to win a seat on the state Board of Equalization, a 
little-known body that sets tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater management, always obsessive about its image even as it shows films 
cheapening sex and exalting violence, was almost apologetic about the novel ad 
placement. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an equal access media, we can't turn anybody down," pleaded Century Media 
Advertisement Manager Alex Gorovitz. "The only restriction is we can't put on 
anything that is not compatible with family entertainment. Alcohol, tobacco or 
anything that's not morally right." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll forgo the easy pick on the morality of elected officials and instead 
point out that, because of adult subject matter, the 26th Amendment to the 
Constitution made voting an NC-18 activity and therefore unsuitable for general 
admission.

EARTHWATCH: QUAKE-SAFE HOME TO BENEFIT FROM RECYCLING; THE CUSTOM DESIGN IS 
BASED ON A SIMILAR HOUSE THAT SURVIVED A HURRICANE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Julie Shular wants to build a different kind of home in Ventura County. It 
won't look particularly unusual when it's built on her lot on Houston Road 
above Pacific Coast Highway. "It will be contemporary-country style," she 
explained, "and I'm looking for compliance with the normal building codes." But 
she intends it to be the most environmentally friendly and earthquake-safe 
residence modern architecture can think up. 
</P>
<P>
 It will have none of the usual heating or air-conditioning equipment, relying 
instead on passive solar construction and natural ventilation. The structure 
itself will resemble a standard, upscale poured-concrete residence except that 
it will be made of sprayed concrete over recycled steel wire mesh filled with 
recycled polystyrene. No structural use of that diminishing resource -- wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds will be minus the usual sprinkler system but will have a 
drought-tolerant xeriscape of native plants. Indeed, the grounds themselves 
will be part of the structure, because berms of earth will mask some of the 
house from view. "It will look like it belongs there on that land -- not a box 
on the property," Shular said. 
</P>
<P>
 As owner-contractor, she has already won the approval of the county Planning 
Commission. And last week she and her architect Paul Bierman-Lytle submitted 
the final plans for the $400,000 project to the county Building and Safety 
Department for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We submitted documentation (about safety performance) we expect will become 
commonplace," Bierman-Lytle said. "These buildings are already going up in New 
England, Florida, Georgia -- even Idaho." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all such "green" buildings are expensive. Some of the Habitat for Humanity 
building projects that former President Jimmy Carter worked on use the same 
prefabricated elements specified for this Ventura County project. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bierman-Lytle awaits the outcome of the application, he is off to the 
East Coast to prepare a big event to be held at the United Nations devoted to 
green building techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole building trade seems to be developing a green tinge. Only 12 months 
ago, at an American Institute of Architect's convention, hardly anyone was 
exhibiting materials made from recycled material or fittings that were 
energy-saving or nontoxic and natural. This year, according to architects I 
interviewed at the recent gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center, one 
out of four exhibitors were hawking such goods. 
</P>
<P>
 I also attended seminars there that described green building projects under 
way in Seattle; Annapolis, Md.; Tucson; Austin, Tex., and Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Florida house that provided our local green builder, Shular, with the 
idea for a building method she suggested to her architect. "I saw a picture in 
the paper of this house standing -- intact -- in the ruins after the 
(Homestead) Florida hurricane," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She checked it out and discovered that four similarly built structures located 
in San Bernardino County had gone through a 6.7 aftershock of Landers 
earthquake in 1992. "Nothing moved inside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings, used as science labs by Southern California Edison, were built 
with recycled material panels manufactured by Insteel Construction Systems of 
Brunswick, Ga. That was how the Carter-affiliated group had heard about the 
panels and used them in Dade County, Fla. Every one of the 15 homes they built 
there survived -- while 80,000 others were leveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental building, it turns out, isn't just a matter of energy and 
resource conservation. It can also be a matter of survival. Details 
</P>
<P>

materials and services, call Pat Lally of the American Institute of Architects 
at 800-365-ARCH.

ON THE ROAD: NOW, A DIGITAL APPROACH TOWARD A HEALTHIER BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gentleman is the model of comportment: dress shirt, dress slacks, fine 
leather shoes, and an elegant manner of speaking to match. That is, until he 
sits down and gets the rotating "fingers" jammed into his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhhh, man," he coos, eyes rolling back in his head. "Oh, oh, nobody does 
this for me, what this feels like." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he gets the "fingers" stuck into the back of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he starts speaking randomly and upward, as if in a trance and as 
if to the sky, even though he is seated on a chair in the center of the 
Buenaventura Mall with dozens of people walking by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhh," he groans in pleasure and in pain. "I mean, you can ask somebody to do 
this for you -- OHHHHH! -- but they never get it right." 
</P>
<P>
 The man controlling the twirling "fingers," Greg Veach, jams another pair into 
the back of a woman nearby. She has a more specific sentiment than the euphoric 
gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Squirming in giddy pleasure, she turns to a friend: "With this, who needs a 
man?" 
</P>
<P>
 Veach has heard it hundreds of times before. He's the purveyor of a 
contraption called Kneading Fingers, a simple plastic box from which protrude 
two snakelike, gloved "fingers" -- a haunting, electrified Addams Family body 
part. The mechanical "fingers" move in a circular motion to mimic the strong, 
sometimes painful human thumbs that are applied in Shiatsu massage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't sell much to teens or young people," Veach says. "Young couples 
around 40 are the most frequent customers. I've had them sit down, take the 
fingers, and look at each other and say, 'Hey, what do I need you for?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veach is a Visalia entrepreneur who joined 24 purveyors in renting booth space 
at the Buenaventura Mall recently for the center's annual Health Fair. And yet 
his booth is one of only eight -- nearly one-third of the Health Fair -- that 
has anything to do with health. 
</P>
<P>
 No cholesterol booth. No glaucoma screening. No blood-pressure checks. Not 
even an appearance by Mr. Juiceman or one of his cut-rate competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there's a gleaming black BMW from Newport Imports up for raffle to 
anyone willing to complete an entry form asking for annual income, home and 
work phone numbers, and level of interest in home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there are displays by Harbor Chrysler RV Center of Ventura; Ventura 
Raceway, with fairground videos of roaring stock cars; Audio Experts of Ventura 
boasting a red pickup truck that could fill Nevada with throbbing stereo; and 
Banker's Life & Casualty, for those wishing, perhaps, to wager against health. 
</P>
<P>
 Veach doesn't mind. Kneading Fingers is packing them in. The brief pleasure 
seems to go a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Veach's only "health" competitors, if you can call them that, are 
Community Memorial Hospital of Ventura, distributing brochures about iron 
deficiency and a new clinic; two chiropractic displays, one by Dr. Randall 
Drake and another by Dr. Richard Walsh and colleagues, all of Ventura, offering 
free alignment checks; Jazzercise, mounting aerobic demonstrations; Ventura 
Kenpo Karate, selling classes; the state Department of Health Services, issuing 
radon counsel; Body Trends of Ventura displaying treadmills; Spas West, with an 
array of hot tubs; E'OLA products, a Utah firm preaching to the unconverted 
about herbal remedies; and Integrative Motion Systems, a Ventura firm selling 
anti-gravity chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these, only spas and anti-gravity chairs seem to pull them in. But then 
they are, like Kneading Fingers, about relief rather than sweat or threat. And 
this is no Health Fair for the Ironmen among us. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Juanita Velasquez of Santa Paula "floats" in the anti-gravity chair, a 
recliner mounted to a motorized base that mimics the pitch-and-yaw of a ship at 
sea. Over headphones she hears a New Age version of "When You Wish Upon a 
Star"; through wired sunglasses, she sees pulsating blue and red lights that 
slow her brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Richard, a retired mason with back problems, is shopping nearby 
for a spa. But there's no discussing spas with Mrs. Velasquez, who, upon rising 
from her chair after only five minutes, is somewhat impaired from pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, um, it's in-des-cri . . . indescribable," she says. "It's better than 
bed. I think I slept, but I'm not sure. I feel . . . g-r-e-a-t." 
</P>
<P>
 But the chair starts at $4,400. And Mr. Velasquez, seeking the most relief for 
the money, has water jets in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 They could, of course, take a few "fingers" in the back instead. A guy named 
Veach will promise them a great life for a mere $169.

SHOP TALK; BREAD MACHINES THAT RISE TO THE OCCASION; FIRST, PICK WHAT FEATURES 
YOU WANT. IT'S THE MONTH FOR DEPARTMENT STORE SALES ON THESE PRODUCTS. 
</P>

 We are not exactly the type to sit at home and bake bread. But we do love to 
eat bread. Especially good, fresh bread. In fact, we've been known to choose a 
restaurant solely for the bread it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after spending a recent weekend at the home of a good friend (who isn't 
the sit-at-home-and-bake type, either), we were surprised to find ourselves 
lusting after one of her kitchen appliances. Her bread machine, to be exact. A 
simple, white box that contains a food mixer, mini-oven and microprocessor in 
one neat package. 
</P>
<P>
 Why this sudden infatuation? It was probably waking on that first morning to 
the unmistakable aroma of fresh baking bread that sealed our fate. We must have 
that machine! Now, what are the features we want our machine to have and where 
can we find one at the best price? 
</P>
<P>
 There are four specific features we are looking for. First, we are very 
superficial and we like our bread to look like bread, not a super colossal 
muffin, so we want a machine with a square or rectangular pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, we want our machine to have a 100% whole wheat cycle. This will please 
health-conscious husbands and diet-conscious teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, a dough cycle is necessary so we can remove the dough to shape our own 
breads. And for making pizza dough, bagels and croissants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, we want a timer so we can relive again and again the experience of 
waking up to fresh bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, major department stores have bread machines on sale this month. 
Looking at the Broadway's selection, we spotted a Regal Breadmaker on sale for 
$99.99 from its original price of $140. It's a small machine, though, and 
doesn't have all the features we're looking for. The Regal 1 1/2 Pounder does 
have a timer, and six varieties of baking cycles. This one is priced at $149.99 
from $240. That is quite a discount. Westbend is priced here at $199.99 from 
$240. This machine has six baking cycles, a keep-warm setting and a timer. It 
also has a window to check on the bread without disturbing the machine's 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bullocks, we admired the Zojirushi. Considered to be one of the best 
machines available, it's on sale for $299.99 from $350. The Zojirushi has eight 
automatic baking settings, memory timer, viewing window, square pan, digital 
clock and beeper. Still at Bullocks, Mr. Loaf (Mr. Coffee's friend), is a 
two-pound producing baker with seven baking modes and a glass window. Bullocks 
also has two models of Breadman by Trillium on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the best deals we saw were at Price-Costco. If you are not a 
member, this might be the time to try to become one. Hitachi's Home Bakery is 
$159.99 and makes two sizes of loaves, two shades of crusts, has four baking 
cycles, (including the dough cycle) a 13-hour delay timer and viewing window. 
This is the very machine my friend paid $300 for. Price-Costco also has Sanyo's 
Bread Factory for $139.99 plus $11 delivery charge. This machine must be 
ordered from their catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of words of caution. You will need kitchen counter space. Also be 
prepared to play with your machine a bit as you learn the basic science of 
bread making. You are still in charge of the ingredients; the mind behind the 
machine. So don't be shy about taking all the credit for the wonderful bread 
your machine produces.

 Does Ventura County like Western themes? Are blue jeans blue? 
</P>
<P>
 When folks in these parts hold a celebration, they like to add a few country 
trappings -- especially when it comes time to walk down the aisle and tie the 
knot. The romantic image of the Old West never seems to fade -- and weddings 
bring out the cowpoke in many of us. Especially in the garb. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're wearing their jeans, the black or the blue, a tuxedo shirt, maybe a 
short tuxedo jacket, the hats. There's the Western wedding dress with fringe on 
it, or beaded fringe," said Jennifer Morton, merchandise manager at The Wharf 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the informal look. Then there's formal Western style. Both looks have 
spread from horse country to urban America -- enough so that the wedding 
industry is turning out attire worthy of bang-up Bonanza-style nuptials. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a Western tuxedo. Lord West, the nation's largest men's formal wear 
company, has come out with special jackets to meet the demand: a waistcoat with 
or without Wyatt Earp-style tails, and a full-length cutaway style, called 
respectively, the Sundance and the Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
 They sell and rent mostly in the Southwest, but the Midwest likes them, and 
even the East wants a few, said their marketing director. They make up about 5% 
of sales nationwide, and the share's growing. 
</P>
<P>
 A California wedding gown designer, Loralie Originals, makes about five gowns 
that fit the Western theme, particularly bouffant styles with puffed sleeves, 
ruffles and lace and "pickups" on the skirt. These dresses double as the 
"Southern belle" style in other parts of the country, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victorian gowns fit the theme too, said Diana Lunde, owner of Fancy Things 
Boutique in Ventura. Also, a gown with an "up and down" skirt (shorter in 
front) is popular for a Western look. "It looks really good with the granny 
boots," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunde also sees the trend building. "The companies have discovered that 
there's a need, so this year they're coming out with all of the cute things," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To extend the motif, there are a number of sites in the county that lend 
themselves to outdoor ranch-style weddings, and there's at least one 
horse-drawn carriage service to bring couples from church to reception in 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It adds a little romance," said Connie Morgan at Morgan Carriage Works in Oak 
View, where couples choose to ride in a surrey or larger Victoria carriage, ". 
. . and it shows the bride off better than if they get into a limo." 
</P>
<P>
 Bridal couples add their own touches to the Western theme. When Marcie and 
John Cook of Camarillo were married in January, the wedding party dressed in 
black Wranglers, black boots and hats, the bride in a traditional gown with her 
everyday black cowgirl boots and bridesmaids wore black and silver dance hall 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our exit song was Garth Brooks' 'Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House,' " 
said Marcie. "We both agreed we wanted something real casual. My husband was 
raised on a farm and trained horses all his life. He won't wear tuxedos." 
</P>
<P>
 A month before, Diana and Frank Wissler of Westlake were married Western style 
-- she in a Cinderella gown, he in a Western tux, boots and cowboy hat. Bridal 
attendants wore floral prints and "acted kind of like can-can girls," while 
groomsmen dressed like the groom, wore sheriff's badges and put on side arms 
for the reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want it to be traditional because traditional gets boring. People 
have been to a million weddings," the bride said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a barbecue dinner and dance, the couple sped away in a special 
promotional car borrowed for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a white Cadillac with (longhorn) steer horns for the hood ornament. 
They go across the whole front, " Diana said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all silver dollars inside. It's great. The gear shift is a gun, the 
door handles are guns. There's a saddle in the back seat." 
</P>
<P>
 As a final touch: "When you blow the horn, it makes cow sounds and horse 
sounds." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the couple rode off into the sunset, presumably startling traffic along 
the way. Just another day in Ventura County, land of the new West.

JAUNTS; ART TAKES TO THE STREET; HUNDREDS OF ARTISTS WILL CREATE WORKS ON 
PAVEMENT OUTSIDE SANTA BARBARA MISSION FOR THE ANNUAL 'I MADONNARI' FESTIVAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Artist Phil Roberts draws the faces of celebrities on the posters he designs 
for the movie industry, but this weekend he'll be down on his hands and knees 
re-creating the work of Michelangelo -- in chalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts will be among hundreds of artists scrunched down on the pavement 
outside the Santa Barbara Mission for the three-day "I Madonnari" Italian 
street painting festival. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a chance to see art in the making. The plaza in front of the mission 
is divided into 200 squares, each ranging from 4-by-6-foot to 12-by-12. As 
thousands of people watch, artists -- some professional, many not -- transform 
the squares into chalk art. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the third day, the drawings are done. Many are spectacular 
reproductions of classical art. Others are wildly contemporary, like one last 
year of a shark in a swimming pool and another of a TV dinner. Geometric 
designs are popular too. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, coordinated by the Santa Barbara County Education Office, is 
free to the crowds who come each year to peruse the unusual art. But it's also 
a fund-raiser for the Children's Creative Project, an organization administered 
by the office, that brings fine arts programs into the schools. Businesses, 
organizations and others sponsor the artwork by buying the squares. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of street art is steeped in Italian history dating to the 16th 
Century. Vagabond painters would arrive in small towns and transform the 
sidewalks and plazas into showcases for their work, which would then wash away 
with the next rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition was called "I Madonnari" because the artists would try to 
reproduce the image of the Madonna. The Italian village of Grazie di Curtatone 
carries on the tradition with an international street painting fair every year 
in front of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the eighth year that the Santa Barbara Mission has been the setting 
for "I Madonnari." It's the fifth time Roberts has sprawled out on the pavement 
with his pastels to re-create a classic. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Los Angeles resident will be the featured artist at the 
festival. He'll have a gigantic spot -- 15-by-20 -- where he plans to reproduce 
a portion of the "Last Judgment," painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine 
Chapel. He prefers doing the classics, rather than contemporary creations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like keeping it along those lines, considering the Santa Barbara Mission 
and the theme of the festival," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many artists at the festival use a grid system to sketch their work, 
Roberts eyeballs it freehand. He's had a lot of practice. When he was only 15 
he was doing caricatures of people at street fairs. Now he sculpts, teaches 
art, designs shoes -- all in addition to his poster art. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the rigors of street art take their toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must have on kneepads," Roberts said. "You're constantly on your knees." 
Not to mention killer backaches from the strain of such intense work. He hopes 
massages and a little yoga will ease him through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts will be working at the base of the mission. Visitors at the festival 
can stroll around the plaza and peruse the artwork, or they can sample Italian 
food on the grass where a market will be set up. Live music, even a singer 
performing Italian love songs, will be ongoing during the three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's activities will wind up with a free concert at 6 p.m. in the 
mission's chapel by members of the Santa Barbara Chamber Orchestra. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "I Madonnari" Italian Street Painting Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday,, Sunday and Monday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Santa Barbara Mission, 2201 Laguna St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Free. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: There is limited parking at the mission so be prepared to track down a 
spot in the area, which is mostly residential.

FOR THE KIDS; BORROWING FROM BARD FOR BUCKS; ACTOR JASON NARVY WILL DIRECT 
NEWBURY HIGH STUDENTS IN AN ABRIDGED VERSION OF 'HAMLET.' THE GROUP HOPES TO 
RAISE $50,000 FOR A NEW CAMPUS THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When actor Jason Narvy was a senior at Newbury Park High School, he did 
Shakespeare. Well, sort of. He starred in the spoof, "Hamlet II." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is doing the real thing. Narvy, 20, is directing a production of 
"Hamlet" at the school to help raise money to build a $2.3-million theater on 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 With Newbury Park senior Justin Lees-Smith starring as Hamlet, Narvy has 
brought together an eclectic cast of students, professionals and community 
actors. They call themselves The Exiled Players. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, produced by the school's drama teacher, Kristi Colell, opens Friday 
and runs for two weekends on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights in the school's 
intimate theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Narvy is familiar with the small venue. As a student, he directed "Arsenic and 
Old Lace" there. He also wrote, directed and appeared in a student production 
he called "Shoot Out at the Dead Cow Saloon." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school graduation two years ago, Narvy landed a part in the 
afternoon kids' TV show, "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." His character, Skull, 
and sidekick, Bulk, are buffoonish school bullies who poke fun at the Rangers' 
outlandish missions and their robotic dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Narvy still lives in Newbury Park, where he performs in local productions. In 
January, he starred in the Conejo Players production of "The Overcoat," adapted 
from a 19th-Century Russian story. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes "Hamlet," something he admits he always wanted to do. So had Colell 
and Lees-Smith, who has starred in a number of school and community 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people wanted to do it," Narvy said. "People came out of the 
woodwork." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't an easy production to stage. The play, Shakespeare's longest, 
usually runs 3 hours 45 minutes. So Narvy tackled the job of editing the 
master's prose. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a painful process. One scene took Narvy a week to edit. "I was working 
with a scalpel, cutting little words," he said. "People might say I've 
bastardized the script." 
</P>
<P>
 But Narvy thinks the end result -- a running time of more than two hours -- 
"brings out the greater flavor" and gives the play a quicker pace, something 
audiences will appreciate. As Shakespeare said, "Brevity is the soul of wit." 
Narvy said he hasn't altered the plot and all the famous lines are still in. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy "Hamlet" is arguably the most famous of Shakespeare's plays. In a 
nutshell, it's about the inner turmoil the prince of Denmark suffers after his 
father, the king, dies and his mother marries the king's brother, Claudius, who 
assumes the throne. The king's ghost appears to Hamlet, accusing Claudius of 
murdering him, and Hamlet seeks revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the characters die by their own hand, by the sword or by poison. The 
cast received some professional help on sword handling from Joe Nassi, who has 
choreographed many fight scenes for the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Narvy also plays the part of Laertes, the brother of Ophelia, who loves 
Hamlet. Jessica Emerling, a student at Agoura High School, plays Ophelia. In 
the role of Claudius is Paul Schrier II, who plays Bulk on the Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cast members are Seth Allen, an independent studies student from 
Thousand Oaks High School, in the role of Horatio, Hamlet's friend; local 
actors Thyra Gustafson and Aaron Van Etten, both of Thousand Oaks, play Queen 
Gertrude and Polonius, Ophelia's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real community effort," said Colell, who added that the goal of this 
and other productions is to raise $50,000 for the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, which seats about 180 on tiered platforms around the stage, adds 
to the community atmosphere and intimacy, said Narvy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Hamlet dies, he's two feet away from you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A group of actor-musicians who call themselves J.P. Nightingale will close out 
the entertainment season for the Conejo Valley Children's Concert Series with 
performances Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which dabbles in classical fairy tales and contemporary stories and 
songs, will perform at 10 and 11:30 a.m. at the Conejo Valley Adult School 
Auditorium, 1025 Old Farm Road, Thousand Oaks. Tickets are $6 at the door. For 
more information, call 493-4348. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Shakespeare's play, "Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Newbury Park High School, 456 N. Reino Road, Newbury Park. The 
theater is located at the back of the school near the basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m., and Sunday, 7:30 p.m.; June 3 and 4, 8 
p.m., and June 5, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Tickets are $6 for adults, $4 for students. Friday's opening night 
performance includes a buffet, and tickets are $10.

AT THE MARKET: GOURMET FARE CROPPING UP AT FARMERS' MARTS; SPECIALTIES AT THE 
OUTDOOR BOOTHS RANGE FROM EXOTIC PASTAS AND SAUCES TO ORGANIC BAKED GOODS AND 
FRESHLY CAUGHT FISH.

<P>
 These days, while perusing the local farmers' market -- eyeing the verdant 
offerings for tonight's tossed salad -- don't be surprised if you happen upon 
an agreeable entree, plus other tidbits to complete a full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Does eggplant and thyme-filled ravioli, smothered in a zesty scallion-basil 
pesto sound appealing? How about fresh sea bass for the main course? Don't 
forget to pick up the sun-dried tomato dinner rolls, and for an after-dinner 
treat, maybe a few biscotti to couple with that hot cup of joe. 
</P>
<P>
 The aforementioned foods and more are available, thanks to a handful of 
entrepreneurs who have found -- or are trying to find -- a niche for their 
wares at Ventura County's numerous farmers' markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers are few, but we may be seeing more of them in the future, said 
Karen Wetzel, manager of the Ventura County Certified Farmers' Markets in 
Ventura, Thousand Oaks and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until recently they weren't even allowed in the certified markets," Wetzel 
said. But thanks to the loosening of guidelines and restrictions set by the 
Department of Agriculture, Wetzel said entry to the markets is now easier to 
navigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easier," maybe, but by no means easy. So if the entrepreneurial light clicked 
on in your mind, and you are thinking that grandma's banana cream pie recipe 
would be a smash hit, beware. 
</P>
<P>
 "Admittance is still extremely difficult," she said. All processed foods must 
be prepared in a government-certified kitchen or commissary. "And generally 
they can't get their homes certified," Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at some of the offerings at area markets -- beyond fruits, 
vegetables, flowers and potted plants: 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Cruickshank -- a caterer by trade -- has recently branched out and is 
offering fresh pastas and sauces exclusively at the Ventura (Saturday), Ojai 
and Thousand Oaks markets, as well as Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta Concerto, as her fledgling business is aptly named, offers a gourmet 
assortment of noodles, including fettuccine, rigatoni, penne, rotelle and 
others. The pastas -- available in dried form as well -- come in a rainbow of 
colors and a range of flavors: hot red pepper, lemon pepper, squid ink, garlic 
and basil, artichoke, pumpkin and more. Cruickshank offers her plump ravioli 
stuffed with spinach and cheese, smoked salmon and dill, and Gorgonzola. And 
she has a range of pestos, sauces and salsas, including sun-dried tomato and 
garlic pesto; cilantro and basil pesto; Indonesian peanut sauce; hot Yucatan; 
and Italian salsas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a couple months to catch on, but now's it's going great," said 
Cruickshank, who started at the markets more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The fresh pastas sell for $2.50 per 1/2-pound. Sauces, sold in 8-ounce 
containers, run $3 and $5; some varieties are 16 ounces for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how they're bitin' -- or being netted -- the fresh fish options 
from Joe Tsunoda and his son, Dennis, can include rock fish species, halibut, 
sea bass, crabs and shrimp. Their catch -- harvested from waters in the Channel 
Islands vicinity -- is available at the Ventura (Saturday and Wednesday), 
Oxnard and Thousand Oaks markets. The "Anjin II Fishery" -- anjin translation: 
"navigator of a ship," says Joe -- is currently the only fish outlet at Ventura 
County markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we catch, that's what we bring (to the markets)," the elder Tsunoda 
said. Hauled to the markets in their specially equipped truck, the ice-packed 
fish are sold whole or in fillets. Though the Tsunoda's attendance record gets 
high marks, there are those times when there is no fish to sell, and Joe 
instead can be seen helping a farmer friend sell his produce. Such was the case 
during a recent Saturday visit to a Ventura installment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis does all of the fishing," Tsunoda said. "He'll go out anywhere from 
two to 12 days and if the weather's bad, he's not able to go out at all." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Jeff Reese tells it, "We grew up in the farmers' markets." Reese and his 
wife, Jeannie, started J&J Ginger Bread Co. from scratch about three years ago. 
"We could never have opened a store of our own," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the baking duo, the farmers' markets provided an opportunity to introduce 
their products commercially, while economics and logistics prevent them from 
entering the ever-competitive retail marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura (Saturday) and Thousand Oaks markets, they offer such ginger 
bread variations as a chewy cookie, biscotti and honey bran muffins. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they are considering other sales avenues, Reese said they'll 
always attend the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: immediate market research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get instant feedback," Reese said. "The feedback we get from customers has 
been invaluable." Customer suggestions have prompted the Reeses to make 
packaging changes, and soon they will include more health-conscious recipes to 
their regular product line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Guagliardo, a former restaurateur, sold his first baked breads at a 
farmers' market in Pomona in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 As he tells it, customers went crazy for his breads -- based on his 
grandmother's "Old World recipes" -- and business has been climbing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Guagliardo, his brother, Jim, and several employees attend 44 markets 
throughout Southern California, from Ventura to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we found was there wasn't any competition at the farmers' markets, so 
that's what we pursued," Guagliardo said, who grew up in New Jersey, feasting 
on his grandma's baked delicacies. "We've been lucky enough to create our own 
niche." 
</P>
<P>
 "At'sa My Bread" -- as Grandma Guagliardo used to exclaim back in New Jersey 
-- became the company moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Rancho Cucamonga and sold exclusively at farmers' markets, the breads 
are available in Ventura County at the Ventura (Saturday and Wednesday), Ojai, 
Oxnard and Thousand Oaks markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The stone oven-baked loafs include: 
</P>
<P>
 A German braided six-grain loaf, crusty Italian sheepherders bread (a 1 
1/2-pound round loaf), sourdough-corn rye, jalapeno Cheddar and 
raisin-walnut-sourdough-rye. There's also sun-dried tomato with basil rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't use eggs or any dairy products, shortening or preservatives," 
Guagliardo said. "There's nothing in the bread you can't pronounce."

THEATER REVIEW; 'ALICE' GETS AN UPDATE AND AN INVENTIVE SPIN; LIT MOON THEATRE 
COMPANY'S 'WONDERLAND' IS RUNNING IN REPERTORY WITH A SEQUEL, 'THROUGH THE 
LOOKING GLASS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Alice says, "I think I've changed several times since I got up today," 
it's a conclusion that audiences will particularly appreciate in the revival of 
Lit Moon Theatre Company's innovative production of "Alice in Wonderland," 
currently playing in repertory with a new sequel, "Through the Looking Glass." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Alice," the role of Lewis Carroll's bewildered child heroine is now 
performed by three identically clad actresses, who trade places to show three 
distinct facets of Alice's emerging personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Shana Lynch is the playful Alice, who delights in the whimsical absurdity of 
Wonderland, Victoria Finlayson is the thoughtful, reasoning Alice trying to 
solve the various puzzles and riddles she faces, and Erin Fiedler embodies the 
physical side of Alice in a staging that addresses the subterranean issues of 
fragmented identity in Lewis Carroll's writings. The three performers minimize 
the confusion with considerable overlap in their characterizations and fluid 
transitional switches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, forcing an audience to keep track of three Alices isn't the most 
straightforward presentational strategy -- but finding unconventional ways to 
tell a story is the forte of Lit Moon director and founder John Blondell. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than working with a scripted adaptation, Blondell's approach to Lit 
Moon's staged works of classical literature is to start with an extended 
improvisation process in which the company collectively explores ways to 
represent the chosen text in purely physical terms, using techniques adapted 
from dance, movement theater, and performance art. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after the piece has been blocked out and the characters defined is the 
dialogue added, excerpted verbatim from the text. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is less reliant on traditional narrative-based dramatic devices, 
and both productions delight with their constant ingenuity in casting new light 
on the familiar figures of Carroll's Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, Tweedledum and 
Tweedledee, and other lunatic creations. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing even the simplest locations has been ingeniously thought out -- 
"Alice's" sea of tears created from billowing fabric, or the boating scene in 
"Looking Glass," in which performers form reeds streaming past. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Tavianini, the only performer retained from Lit Moon's original 
"Alice" production two years ago, proves the most accomplished and natural with 
the rapid character changes and intense physical demands of the two plays, 
contorting himself into a table or taking innumerable backward pratfalls as the 
bumbling White Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 While not yet at the same level of Tavianini's seemingly effortless dexterity, 
the newer cast members have adapted impressively to the shows' unique 
performance requirements -- especially Stan Hoffman's deranged chess pieces in 
"Looking Glass" (the Red Queen and White King) and Mills' wistful Mock Turtle 
in "Alice," sighing nostalgically for the academic pursuits of his school days 
(Reeling, Writhing, and the branches of Arithmetic: Ambition, Distraction, 
Uglification, and Derision). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the movement-based representations, the characters are defined 
by the distinctive masks crafted by costume designer Lesley Finlayson, who 
brings a surreal -- and often disturbing -- look to the production, reinforced 
in Theodore Michael Dolas' abstract set and eerie lighting. Composer Michael 
Mortilla provides the original piano accompaniment in both pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, despite numerous past presentations of "Alice," the newer "Looking 
Glass" offers the tighter ensemble work -- the cast members seem more 
comfortable with characters they've evolved rather than inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Looking Glass" lacks the thematic integrity that makes "Alice" so 
emotionally affecting -- her transformation from a disoriented and often silly 
child into a more responsible girl, and the loss of innocence that accompanies 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we meet her in "Looking Glass," Alice's initially-fragmented 
identity has stabilized into a single portrayal (Lynch's), and the focus shifts 
from the inner realm of character evolution to the purely episodic chaos of her 
external environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether you prefer looking inward or gazing out, either show is bound to 
make you take a second look at a once-familiar childhood friend. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW / ALLEGRO; WHERE FOOD, WAITERS HIT HIGH NOTES; IT'S A HAPPY, 
SONG-FILLED PLACE THAT TICKLES THE PALATE AND SENDS WOMEN DINERS HOME WITH A 
RED ROSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Italian restaurants have a certain mystique they don't always live up to. 
They're supposed to offer a more zany level of hospitality than other 
establishments. They're supposed to have waiters who burst passionately into 
song. They're supposed to feed you with rich and exotic fare and send you on 
your way with a full stomach and a happy heart. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, Allegro more than satisfies these expectations. It even 
sends all the ladies home with a red rose. Which is why on a Saturday night 
every table is full, and the place resonates with the chatter of good-times. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes the waiters -- and waitresses -- sing, accompanied by a live piano 
player Wednesdays through Sundays. One of the best of the singers also happens 
to be chef and part owner, Sal Fiumerodo, whose rendition of "Volare" brought 
tears to my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 On our first visit we were charmingly bowled over by the personality of our 
waiter, who sidled up to the table like a man with watches to sell. He could 
easily pass for Joe Pesci's sound-alike. As he served the wine, he poured out 
the saga of his early years. The appetizers brought the crisis of his 
education. By the main course we knew all his children and by dessert we'd 
heard his theories on marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not want a waiter like this every time, but then most nights this 
place is too busy for extended confidences. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, they put on the table a basket of puffy little morsels of 
garlicky bread whose aroma defined the word appetizing. These went down well 
with a carpaccio di bue appetizer, thin slices of beef that had been cured like 
prosciutto, served with leaves of arugula and marvelous shaved Parmesan cheese, 
sprinkled with a fine vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good appetizer, pepperoni arrostiti ($5.95) consisted simply of 
roasted red peppers, thick and slippery with olive oil, heightened with 
anchovies, giant capers and pungent garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 A minestrone soup was all soft vegetables and spiky flavors. Tortellini in 
brodo, almost a meal in itself, had a wonderful broth with a kiss of lemon. The 
tortellini were filled with ground veal with the texture of pate. 
</P>
<P>
 The house salad was somewhat ordinary, certainly like nothing I ever had in 
Italy. It was of the iceberg-on-ice-cold-plate variety, with a dressing that 
seemed to be mixed with salsa. This is the salad they make the chicken salad 
with at lunch, and it's only somewhat improved by the chicken, raisins and pine 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 For a truly spectacular salad go for the insalata tricolore, consisting of 
arugula, radicchio and endive in a vinaigrette to cheer for. The Caesar salad 
was not bad either, though its creamy dressing was more salty than garlicky. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing they do quite admirably here is their excellent fresh tomato sauce. 
It can be found on pasta side dishes and well as the pizza. A splendid 
spaghetti a la puttanesca ($12.95) had also utilized fresh tomatoes, along with 
the brawny tastes of garlic, capers, anchovies and black olives. 
</P>
<P>
 Linguine al pesto was a milder dish, sweetly laced with whole pinion nuts. I 
also tried -- one frantically busy night -- a capellini a la caprese, which I 
ordered as takeout. But they forgot to put on the fresh buffalo mozzarella. Too 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite entree turned out to be the most expensive on the menu: a thick 
veal chop ($22.95) loaded with porcini mushrooms so rich and flavorful they 
seemed to taste of chocolate. It outshone the tournedos Diana that came in a 
sauce we dubbed Pasadena brown gravy. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish was always good, especially tasty sole meuniere as soft as butter, 
pleasingly moistened by a buttery lemon-wine sauce. A nice fresh salmon 
($16.95) had been grilled with aromatic herbs like chervil and tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken cacciatore was strictly for people who think chicken and cheese is a 
good combination, and some do. I liked a chicken dish called pollo Portofino 
($13.95) better for its lemony wine sauce and munchy pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, I tasted a state of the art flan and a cheesecake more cake-like 
than creamy, decent but not thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sort of restaurant where you always seem to find a big family 
birthday party in progress, with 16 to 20 people at a long table. All that is 
missing to evoke a gathering of the clan in Tuscany are the grape-covered 
arbor, little kids playing underfoot and vineyards in the distance. Still, even 
without the arbor, the restaurant does a pretty wonderful job of evoking the 
charms and the pleasures of Italy. Details

TELECOMMUTING AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Telecommuting Boomlet Has Few Follow-Up Calls," May 16: 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting will work when the traditional hierarchical organizational 
structure finally goes away. As long as there are "managers" who feel it 
necessary to practice MBWA (management by walking around), the trust on which 
telecommuting depends just won't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardware is the easiest obstacle to overcome. Personal computers, FAX 
modems and (for those who must use paper) single-box 
laser-printer/scanner/copier units get cheaper by the minute and will one day 
be found in every literate household. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommuting concept must be able to pass the acid test; it must be found 
acceptable to both the telecommuter (in terms of its convenience and utility) 
and the employer (in terms of its productivity and reliability). Telecommuting 
centers? Definitely half-acid!

 * The 40 workstations at the county's expanded Antelope Valley Telebusiness 
Center are 100% occupied, with companies committed to stay at least six months. 
The facts of the matter belie the story's claim that "leasing is sluggish," 
post-quake telecommuting centers are "riddled with vacancies" and telecommuting 
is merely a fad. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for work space for telecommuting in the Antelope Valley soared 
following the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, due to the inaccessible freeways 
and other commuting problems. My office and the county-sponsored Antelope 
Valley Telebusiness Center were deluged with inquiries from individuals and 
companies seeking emergency work space for stranded employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting has proven beneficial to both industry and the environment. It 
increases productivity and efficiency, leading to reduced business costs. It 
cuts pollution and congestion by freeing drivers from long commutes. The users 
of the Antelope Valley Telebusiness Center alone drive over 24,600 miles less a 
week, eliminating nearly 700 tons of smog-forming pollutants from our air. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, telecommuting is a success story in a region desperately in need 
of success stories.

 Using a 14,400-baud modem, trying to communicate remotely with an office 
computer, is about 10 times slower than sitting at a hard-wired terminal.

telecommuter?

DON'T GUT DESERT PROTECTION BILL; HOUSE MUST REJECT HANDFUL OF DESTRUCTIVE 
AMENDMENTS TO HISTORIC BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an eight-year struggle, the U.S. Senate last month passed the historic 
Desert Protection Act, a measure that would set aside 3.6 million acres in 
California's rugged southeastern desert and turn the popular Death Valley, 
Joshua Tree and Eastern Mojave Desert national monuments into national parks. 
Now, as the House wraps up debate on a similar version of the bill, lawmakers 
are scheduled to consider a number of amendments that would eviscerate the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most odious provisions, backed by the National Rifle Assn. and 
offered up by Reps. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) and Larry LaRocco (D-Ida.), would 
downgrade the 1.2-million-acre Eastern Mojave National Park to a national 
preserve to allow hunting there. The full House, like the Senate and the House 
Natural Resources Committee before it, would be wise to drive a stake through 
the heart of this unnecessary and damaging amendment. In fact, damage to the 
Desert Protection Act is just what the amendment sponsors intend. Lewis has 
called the bill "a wish list for a small band of well-funded and influential 
preservation groups with a narrow ideological agenda." He's right about the 
narrow agenda. But it's his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and LaRocco purport to defend the right to hunt. What they conveniently 
ignore is that nearly 10 million acres of public lands outside the parks 
already are available for hunting and other recreational activities. That 
doesn't even include a million more acres of state and private lands. 
</P>
<P>
 So the question is: Are 20 to 30 deer and five bighorn sheep -- the game 
killed by hunters last year in the proposed Eastern Mojave park area -- reason 
enough to deny the nation a pristine wilderness for posterity? Clearly, the 
answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers should reject this amendment and the other amendments that would 
weaken the bill. Such provisions have more to do with protecting special 
interests than national interests. The House, led by members of the California 
delegation, should pass a desert bill that sticks to the spirit and language of 
the Senate version.

ELECTION WATCH; REELECT MOLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was widely predicted that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would 
never be the same after Gloria Molina was voted onto it in a special 1991 
election. Rarely has the conventional wisdom been more accurate -- and rarely 
has the public interest been better served. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the five supervisors represents roughly 1.8 million constituents. They 
jointly administer a $14.7-billion budget, and there's no powerful elected 
executive to check them. Individually, they have more power than many 
small-state governors and most members of Congress. Yet the board gets less 
attention than the average city council. That's why for too many years the 
county government was a closed, cozy little club. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when Molina, who represents the east county's 1st District, 
started living up to her reputation for ornery independence. Last year, for 
example, she helped save county taxpayers millions of dollars by shaming her 
colleagues into rolling back an outrageous pension-spiking scheme for top 
county officials. That gutsy act by itself would merit her reelection, to a 
full term, in the June 7 primary election, but she has achieved a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Molina's reelection is assured because she has no opponents on the 
ballot, she gets an enthusiastic Times endorsement nonetheless -- for, among 
other things, starting a trend of openness in county government that 
accelerated with the 1992 election of Yvonne Brathwaite Burke to the board. 
That trend can gain further in the next four years if Molina works at mellowing 
her still occasionally abrasive style.

THE TERRORISM CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the Cold War, the United States and its allies assessed every local 
conflict for its quotient of strategic harm or benefit. With the Cold War 
ended, the allies believe that they may allow local conflict to remain local 
with relative impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The war in the Balkans has been a semi-exception to this rule. The European 
powers have not felt that they could safely ignore the carnage there 
completely, but they have also not felt that any enemy could exploit this war 
to their serious harm. Serb expansionism under Slobodan Milosevic was, at 
worst, an ominous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 But this calculus may be due for a revision. Though the Bosnian government has 
accepted a European proposal for a Bosnian partition, the separatist Bosnian 
Serbs have not. The war seems all but certain to continue, and the U.N. forces 
may soon be weakened by the reduction or even elimination of French and British 
support. If that happens, the conflict may continue as a Christian-Muslim 
conflict with outside support from the more ardent wing of each side's 
co-religionists. To oversimplify, Serbs-against-Bosnian-Muslims could become 
Cossacks-against-Mujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, this local conflict would begin to become a grim imitation of 
the Cold War proxy conflicts of old. This time it would be the shadow of 
terrorism, rather than the shadow of nuclear conflict, that would lengthen. The 
Muslim minorities in several European countries are increasingly aggrieved and 
militant. The heavy loss of Muslim life that would result in the short term 
from a U.N. default in Bosnia could exacerbate their sense of grievance and 
foster the related militancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric heard at the sentencing of the World Trade Center terrorist 
bombers should remind us that the United States is not immune. That crime was 
utterly savage, and the life sentences that have now been imposed are fully 
justified. But a great deal can be lost in cross-cultural translation, 
especially in a climate of rising hostility. That climate will only worsen if 
the situation in Bosnia worsens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fighting them there so that we won't have to fight them here," American 
soldiers said in Korea and Vietnam. In this instance, ironically, it is 
refusing to defend Muslims there that may lead in time to defending against 
other Muslims here.

TARGETING ROGUES IN WHITE COLLARS; SEC CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON STOCKBROKER FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sorry pattern of lax oversight and inadequate disciplinary action against 
unscrupulous stockbrokers has cost many an individual investor. Too many. Now 
the Securities and Exchange Commission has wisely called for tougher 
regulations to weed out the rogue stockbrokers who habitually defraud customers 
in different ways to pad their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. said last week that the agency will beef up 
enforcement efforts against brokerages and brokers to crack down on unethical 
brokers. Also, in an effort to prevent conflicts of interest among brokers, he 
appointed a blue-ribbon panel to make recommendations on changing the 
traditional way they are compensated. The current payment of commissions and 
bonuses often tempts brokers to push sales at the expense of client interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC is taking a tougher stand after completing a two-year investigation of 
broker sales practices at nine large securities firms. The SEC found problems 
at three of the firms and said that a quarter of the 161 office inspections 
conducted during the investigation turned up evidence of wrongdoing. Those 
cases have been referred for further investigation and possible disciplinary 
action. The illegal activities included unauthorized trades, excessive trading 
to generate commissions for brokers, putting customers in unsuitably risky 
securities and improperly switching customers from one mutual fund to another. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe, the first of its kind, was triggered by a 1992 investigative series 
about rogue brokers by Times staff writer Scot J. Paltrow. The reporting 
revealed that Paine-Webber, Prudential Securities and several other well-known 
Wall Street firms hired and kept on brokers who had long records of lawsuits, 
arbitration cases, customer complaints and disciplinary action. The series 
pointed out that the SEC itself seldom brought cases against brokers and firms 
for cheating individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
 To put more muscle in enforcement, Levitt called for regulatory and 
legislative changes to hold management and the brokerages themselves 
accountable for employing brokers with a his- tory of problems. Among the SEC 
recommendations: providing for more inspectors and increasing the frequency of 
routine inspections by the SEC and stock exchange examiners and giving 
enforcement authorities the right to ban brokers from the industry for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly most stockbrokers operate within proper limits. But those who play 
outside the rules make easy prey of unsuspecting investors. Regulatory changes 
are needed to stop such abuses.

LEGAL DEFENSE FUND FOR CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Being Fair With a Beset Bill Clinton," editorial, May 13: 
Who is being fair with the American public? 
</P>
<P>
 We have been involved in an accounting malpractice suit and were left with 
astronomical legal fees by lawyers who charged us like we were a Fortune 500 
company, whereas we are just a family-owned building contracting firm in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do you feel Bill Clinton is entitled to accept donations for his legal 
fees so as not to be driven to financial ruin? What happens to the average 
citizen if he is driven to financial ruin? Who do they have to donate to their 
cause? Our legal fees were in excess of $600,000 with $135,000 more still 
owing. 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree very much. If we are forced to pay our exorbitant fees, unfair as 
they are, I think Clinton should certainly pay his.

<P>
 * In response to "Plans Readied for Clinton Legal Defense Fund" (May 10) 
several observations are in order: 
</P>
<P>
 * The term wealth is not synonymous with income . Although the Clintons report 
earning $255,000 per year, their wealth has been reported between $750,000 to 
$1 million, and maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the Clintons need money, why not simply give Hillary another $1,000 to 
invest in cattle futures? 
</P>
<P>
 * Why the need for a legal defense fund for a person who is earning $250,000 
per year?  
</P>
<P>
 * It is patently obvious that this is simply another way for liberal special 
interest groups to make payoffs for all that the President is doing for them. 
</P>
<P>
 * If Clinton is just a humble common man as he attempts to portray, why does 
he have to hire the most expensive lawyer in the country? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * As an American and as a Christian I am appalled by the unsupported charges 
that the right-wing of the Republican Party continues to throw at President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read your article (May 14) stating that evangelist Jerry Falwell is 
marketing a 2 1/2-hour videotape of unproven allegations involving President 
Clinton, ranging from sexual misconduct to murder, I was disgusted. Jerry 
Falwell and Pat Robertson say they are men of God -- I say they are men of the 
devil. They are evil and are trying to tear our country apart with their 
hatred.

<P>
 * In response to "When the Motive Appears to Be Money," by William Schneider, 
Opinion, May 15: 
</P>
<P>
 I had many reasons to vote for Bush. I had many reasons not to vote for 
Clinton. I couldn't stand Clinton. I had bad vibes and foresaw many problems. I 
never envisioned the weekly menu of catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 I reject being categorized as a "Clinton hater . . . rubbing my hands with 
glee." Yes, I am a Clinton hater, but I am an American first and I resent the 
office of President demeaned and ridiculed in the world's eyes. I am rubbing my 
eyes to wipe away tears.

 * Too bad Robert Scheer didn't read William Schneider before he wrote his 
Column Left of the same day. If he had he would have realized that the 
differences between Anita Hill and Paula Jones are many, and they are spelled 
P-o-l-i-t-i-c-s and M-o-n-e-y. I think he's really smart enough to have figured 
it out for himself, but chose instead to use this as an opportunity to bash the 
so-called "ultra-feminists," an increasingly popular sport these days.

 JOY PICUS

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I agree with George Mitrovich and Teresa Godwin Phelps (Commentary, May 20) 
that the President should be immune from civil lawsuits during his term in 
office. Being President of the United States is probably the most demanding and 
stressful job there is. The President needs to give all of his time and energy 
to the job at hand.  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't vote for President Clinton, but he's got the job now. We're paying 
for a full-time President to run this country, and we're not getting our 
money's worth if his attention is on matters such as the Paula Jones case or 
the Whitewater matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The President should be responsible for his actions, and Paula Jones should 
have her day in court, but it should wait until he's done being President. Bill 
Clinton may be guilty of sexual harassment. He's a human being, not a perfect 
man. Apparently, the lady is not saying she was physically harmed, only 
mentally damaged, say $700,000 worth. RUDOLPH F. SILVA

</P>
<P>
 * Re Paula Jones ("Clinton Accuser Shuns Spotlight," May 20): How can she 
afford an oceanfront apartment? Her husband's job must really pay well, or 
could it be someone else is picking up the tab? 
</P>
<P>
 I wish the reporters who are so great at digging up dirt on Clinton would 
follow the Paula Jones' money trail. I live on the same beach as Jones, and the 
rent is not cheap.

CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial on the Long Beach Campaign Finance Reform proposal, "Opening 
the Club" (May 18), severely missed the point. This campaign reform proposal 
will break our city budget! 
</P>
<P>
 You claim it will only cost "each resident about 50 cents per year." That 
equals almost $1 million per year. Who knows what the final bill will be once 
special interest candidates realize they can use tax dollars to pay for their 
one-issue campaigns? Campaign money will come from the same general fund that 
pays for Long Beach's police, health services, parks, libraries and street 
repairs. Which programs would you want to cut to pay for more politicians? 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is facing an $11-million budget shortfall this year. We do not know 
where those forced cuts will come from let alone where the extra $1 million in 
cuts will be made in order to fund campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Public financing is better called welfare for politicians and is completely 
irresponsible in light of the severe difficult economic times we face!

LIBRARY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial (May 8) regarding a special library tax in South Pasadena 
deserves rebuttal. While the state did reduce about $900,000 in funds over a 
two-year period, the city implemented new sources of revenue (taxes and fees) 
that greatly exceeded this shortfall: a 5% utility tax, a 54% minimum increase 
in water rates, a new street lighting and landscaping assessment district, and 
a substantial increase in fees.A conservative figure for the increased revenue 
would be $1.7 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Top pay in South Pasadena for the head librarian is $72,528. Librarians in 
neighboring cities receive much less.  
</P>
<P>
 The per capita expenditure for 30 municipal libraries in the Metropolitan 
System averages $30.80. South Pasadena spends $36.42 -- 21% above the average. 
Do we need higher taxes or better management? 
</P>
<P>
 I am a founding member of the South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. and a signatory 
on the ballot argument against the library tax.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES P. PINKERTON: CONGRESS: NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY; 
THE NATIONAL HEALTH BOARD WOULD INSULATE POLITICIANS FROM UNPOPULAR DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES P. PINKERTON, James P. Pinkerton, based in Washington, is a senior 
fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's original plan for health-care soviets may be 
dead, but Washington pols are still struggling to assemble bureaucratic body 
parts into a Frankenstein to carry them across the electoral finish line in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning struck in one political laboratory last week when the Senate Labor 
and Human Resources Committee voted 17-0 to piece together a National Health 
Board to establish a "standard benefits package" for any health proposal. This 
may have been a small victory for bipartisanship, but it was a big one for the 
system of simultaneous credit-taking and blame-shifting that Congress has 
perfected. The board will empower both Democrats and Republicans to say 
whatever they want about how compassionate (or thrifty) they are, secure in the 
knowledge that bureaucrats will take the heat for the defects of the ultimate 
health-care product. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the board say it will control costs. But that's not why Congress 
created it. The board's real value is as a diversionary punching bag. Citizens, 
sick from disease of the body and/or the wallet, will target faceless 
apparatchiks, not real-live elected officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans rail against both bureaucrats and Congress, without really 
comprehending the symbiotic relationship between the two. One who does get it 
is David Schoenbrod, a professor at New York Law School and author of the new 
book "Power Without Responsibility: How Congress Abuses the People Through 
Delegation." Schoenbrod argues that Congress writes flabby laws, leaving "hard 
choices" to unelected bureaucrats. This is great for Congress: It make no 
enemies, only friends. But democratic accountability suffers. "When the 
lawmakers we elect have others make the law," Schoenbrod writes, "the people 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 This systemic scam -- politicians hiding behind bureaucrats -- has allowed 
Medicare spending to quadruple in the last dozen years. By contrast, the 
inflation of health-care costs in the private sector has been diminishing, as 
insurers have squeezed down benefits. Such cost-cutting is easy for business 
people; they don't have to win popularity contests. But politicians do, and 
that means currying favor with those who can give them votes or money. 
Schoenbrod shows how lawmakers become rainmakers: "Legislators now spend more 
time soliciting campaign contributions and campaigning for reelection than 
legislating." 
</P>
<P>
 This delegation is fine with the special interests; they know that the board 
will be the Potomac equivalent of one-stop shopping. Lobbyists will descend on 
it like vampires in the night; groups that can't win their case in the daylight 
of the free market or public opinion will suck what they want from the American 
jugular. 
</P>
<P>
 All the incentives in Washington are to increase spending. Consider just one 
controversial issue that Congress will delegate to the Board: coverage for 
mental health. No rational lawmaker wants to vote "against" the mentally ill, 
but nobody wants to be on record voting to pay for such expensive coverage, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 The George Washington University Medical Center has been running ads in the 
Washington Post arguing for "non-discriminatory inclusion" of mental-health 
treatment in any plan. The ads say that full treatment for depression would 
save the nation $35 billion a year in restored productivity. Maybe so. But the 
mental-health community has every incentive to low-ball cost estimates, since 
once the program is in place it will be almost impossible to roll back the 
entitlement, even if the projections turn out to be grotesquely wrong, as they 
were three decades ago with Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider other candidates for "non-discriminatory inclusion" in the 
standard-benefits package: post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit 
disorder, repressed memory of sexual abuse, multiple personalities and "ghetto 
stress syndrome." Overnight, special pleaders on behalf of these ailments and 
more will spring up, all demanding their fair share of the federal pie. And in 
the final irony, members of Congress will use all their influence on the board 
to help a favored constituency. That's right: Congress will lobby its own 
creation, because the final responsibility will still rest with the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is not to single out mental health for criticism. One could just as 
easily predict the income-optimizing advocacy of balding men, shamans, 
fallen-arch sufferers and Christian Science practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is this: If Washington creates a political football, everybody will 
toss it around. The National Health Board won't eliminate politics. It will 
merely insulate the President and Congress from political consequences.

WHO WILL KEEP THE LIBERAL FLAME, IF NOT BREYER?; SUPREME COURT: WE NEED A 
JURIST WITH A PASSION FOR JUSTICE, NOT ANOTHER TECHNOCRAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN REINHARDT, Stephen Reinhardt is a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is intended as a personal appeal to a colleague and friend, Supreme Court 
nominee Stephen Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many people who desperately need your understanding and 
compassion. The sad truth is that you are not only succeeding Harry Blackmun. 
You are the only potential successor to William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, 
Earl Warren, William O. Douglas and the whole line of humanitarian justices who 
understood the importance of compassion and the need to do justice, not just 
administer law. There are lots of able technicians who understand law. The 
nation, however, is entitled to at least one justice with vision, with breadth, 
with idealism, with -- to say the word despised in the Clinton Administration 
-- a liberal philosophy and an expansive approach to jurisprudence. Someone 
must carry on the work of the court's great progressive thinkers -- the 
justices who ended de jure racial segregation, brought us one man/one vote, 
opened the courts to the poor and needy, established the right to counsel for 
all defendants, gave women true legal equality. It was progressive justices 
with a view of the Constitution as a living, breathing document who gave full 
measure to that instrument -- not the legal technocrats, not those whose view 
of the Constitution was frozen as of 1789. 
</P>
<P>
 You have a wonderful opportunity and an awesome responsibility. You can be a 
narrow, cramped proceduralist like Felix Frankfurter, or you can seize the 
occasion and grow like a Warren, a Brennan, a Blackmun. You can be cold, purely 
intellectual and wholly technical, or you can become what the President said he 
was looking for -- a justice who is compassionate, who has a big heart. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope you will re-examine your judicial philosophy. Everyone who goes on the 
court should. And when you emerge, I hope it will be to assume the mantle of 
the Brennan-Warren legacy. Otherwise, that voice will be silenced -- perhaps 
permanently. How ironic if that would be the enduring consequence of electing a 
President supported so strongly by the poor, the needy, minorities of all 
kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, I am most hopeful for the court and the country with you there. 
Perhaps I'm influenced by my personal feelings, but I believe that you will not 
let the spirit of liberalism be extinguished, that you will be a strong voice 
for a philosophy that now has no other means of expression. It simply cannot be 
otherwise -- not after all that your spiritual predecessors have fought and 
struggled for, including the marvelous and caring justice for whom you clerked, 
Arthur Goldberg. You represent an awful lot of hopes, dreams and aspirations -- 
a vision of a nation. For better or for worse, those who depend on the court to 
protect their fundamental rights must now look to you. You are their best and 
last hope. 
</P>
<P>
 As I listened to the minority leader of the Senate say, "He's not as liberal 
as Blackmun," and as I heard Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) express his joy over 
your selection, I thought of how important it is to have scruples and 
convictions and to stick by them. How I hope that those who disdain the 
expansive and humanitarian philosophy of the Warren / Brennan court have 
misread you. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives who fight for what they believe in deserve respect and 
admiration. It is hard to have those feelings for others who are easily 
intimidated, who fear controversy, who care only about compromise and consensus 
or their own success. There are plenty of centrists around.They now represent 
the left of the court. While I rarely agree with Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist, I respect him. When he was appointed to the court, he was a lone 
voice for a judicial philosophy of the right. He was regularly on the short end 
of 8-1 votes, but he spoke for an important point of view and he almost 
single-handedly kept alive the principles in which he believed. They now 
dominate our judicial thinking. I don't expect you to be that successful, but 
at least give us a voice.  
</P>
<P>
 The court has lots of intellect. While you will add to it, Justice Antonin 
Scalia represents abstract rationality well enough. But soul is important too. 
That is what makes greatness.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; MIX THOROUGHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury, which is used to focusing attention elsewhere, 
in 1993 inadvertently turned the spotlight on itself with its call for a 
three-year moratorium on immigration nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 The position caused such a stir that the U.S. Civil Rights Commission now has 
before it a complaint filed by the League of United Latin American Citizens.The 
complaint is expected to be reviewed in commission hearings later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 What became clear immediately when the controversy developed last year was 
that the grand jury was not at all representative of the diversity of the 
county it served. For example, the jury impaneled last July included 16 whites, 
one Latino, one African American and one Native American. Their average age was 
64, and the youngest juror was 44. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the grand jury later decided to make more of an effort to 
diversify itself. Fifteen thousand flyers were sent to libraries, churches, 
civic groups, chambers of commerce and city halls in an attempt to bring in a 
wider range of applicants for service on the jury.  
</P>
<P>
 And now, although the results of that campaign are not overwhelming, they do 
indicate noteworthy progress. The new grand jury, to be sworn in July 1, has 
eight women and 11 men. Two are African American, two are Asian American and 
three are Latino. The rest are white. And there is more diversity in age on the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 This is being hailed by some as the most diverse ever in age, gender and 
ethnicity. What it is, above all, is a start.

 Second Trial Ahead in Bar Study Case: A federal district court jury deadlocked 
on the punitive damages portion of an antitrust lawsuit brought by Barpassers 
of Santa Monica against BAR/BRI, the nation's largest bar review company.Last 
week, the jury awarded Barpassers nearly $4 million in damages, plus attorney 
fees. However, BAR/BRI was also awarded $752,000 in damages for deceptive 
advertising by Barpassers in the dispute between the rivals. A date for the 
retrial has not yet been set.

LONG-TERM RATE DECLINE BUOYS STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street stocks rose Wednesday, buoyed by a drop in long-term interest 
rates, but the dollar and commodities fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market received a boost when the Treasury sold $11 billion of 
five-year notes at a yield of 6.78%. It was the highest yield rate since 
five-year notes sold at 6.93% on April 23, 1992. Meanwhile, the yield of the 
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.36% from 7.40% at Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybean prices plummeted again on the outlook for more rain in the Midwest, 
and coffee prices, just recently at 5 1/2-year highs, tumbled again, with the 
July contract down 5.35 cents to 127.75 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished with a gain of 10.13 at 3,755.30 
after spending much of the session at depressed levels. It was off about 19 
points at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market barometers behaved similarly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the positive readings, market analysts were unimpressed. Investors 
lacked compelling reasons to buy or sell, so they merely mimicked action in the 
bond market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrating the neutrality, the numbers of stocks rising and falling on the 
New York Stock Exchange were fairly close, with 1,115 up, 1,025 down and 670 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market analysts were puzzled by the market's morning slump, given that a 
new government report suggested economic growth has eased. Normally, 
inflation-wary bond traders take comfort in signs of moderating economic 
activity because price pressures are less apt to get out of hand when the 
economy expands slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 The report that failed to produce the expected response showed orders to U.S. 
factories for durable goods inched up 0.1% in April. The unexpectedly low 
increase was the smallest since orders dipped 1.8% during an exceptionally 
wintry February, according to the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell against European currencies as interest rates continue to rise 
there. But the decline against the Japanese yen was less pronounced, and some 
attributed it to optimism over the revival of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold and silver prices also ended slightly lower at the Commodity Exchange in 
New York. June gold edged down 50 cents to $386.80 an ounce, and July silver 
fell 6.8 cents to $5.557. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau's widely followed index of 21 commodities sank 
3.10 points to 231.59 because of the second consecutive day of plunging futures 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Chicago Board of Trade, July soybeans fell 20 cents to $6.75 a bushel 
on top of Tuesday's 37-cent drop. 
</P>
<P>
 At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil dropped 22 cents to $17.70 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights 
</P>
<P>
 * Gtech Holdings tumbled 12 3/4 to 22 7/8 in brisk turnover after the company 
said it expects its 1995 net income to be flat or below 1994's level. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors apparently attached more significance to the downbeat financial 
forecast than to news that Gtech was included in a consortium awarded the 
contract to run Britain's National Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 * One stock that commanded investor attention didn't even trade. Trading in 
Philip Morris was halted all day on the NYSE as its board met to consider plans 
to divide the company's tobacco and food operations. The company said late in 
the day that the board had not acted on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hewlett-Packard steadied after a steep intra-day tumble triggered by reports 
that the company's chief financial officer made cautionary comments about 
revenue growth in a meeting with securities analysts. Hewlett-Packard finished 
5/8 lower at 81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * BroadBand Technologies's share price fell 11% amid fears that it may not get 
a piece of a GTE Corp. video network contract. 
</P>
<P>
 BroadBand's stock dropped 1 7/8 to 15 1/2 on Nasdaq trading of 570,300 shares. 
Bell Atlantic Corp. last week chose AT&T Corp. and General Instrument Corp. as 
prime contractors for its multibillion-dollar video network. BroadBand was 
picked to do future work only on a project-by-project basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller company stocks also had a so-so session, with heavy selling in Chiron 
inciting a setback for biotechnology stocks. The Nasdaq Stock Market composite 
index closed 0.60 higher at 732.07. The American Stock Exchange's market value 
index inched up 0.07 to 439.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiron lost 4 23/64 to 62 17/64 after the stock's investment rating was 
reduced to "hold" from "buy" by Montgomery Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In moving ahead, Wall Street bucked the trend established in Europe where 
share prices slumped on major markets. Speculation about the timing and scope 
of German interest rate reductions put markets on edge, with Frankfurt, London 
and Paris all finishing lower. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index, having plunged 90 points in the last two 
sessions, is expected to drop further as traders come to grips with minimal 
volume and what they call an alarming lack of new investment. The DAX index 
closed at 2,158.77, down 39.95 points, or 1.82%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks in Tokyo, by contrast, had a decent session after investors were 
encouraged by a compromise in U.S.-Japanese trade talks. The 225-share Nikkei 
average finished up 41.51 points at 20,663.63. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, shares closed modestly higher as afternoon profit taking trimmed 
steep early gains from positive news on Hong Kong's airport project. But the 
Australian share market closed sharply lower as local confidence took a 
battering amid weakness in the gold, banking and resource sectors. The All 
Ordinaries closed down 26.5 points at 2105.9. 
</P>
<P>
 South African shares drifted lower as the market reacted to a lower gold 
price.

VISA, SPRINT TEAM UP FOR DISCOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visa International stepped up its battle with MasterCard International on 
Wednesday by offering a new service with Sprint that lets users charge 
long-distance calls at a deep discount. 
</P>
<P>
 The Visa-Sprint alliance puts one more contender into a credit card industry 
already crowded with programs offering discounts for calls charged to their 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Visa card's new feature, VisaPhone, ups the ante by offering a discount 
25% cheaper than the calling card rate offered by AT&T, the biggest 
long-distance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T has been in a competitive brawl with Sprint and the other leading 
long-distance company, MCI. With VisaPhone, even users of AT&T's own Visa card, 
the Universal Card, could choose to receive the Sprint discount.

SCREEN STYLE: STONE-AGERS NEVER LOOKED THIS GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The Movie: "The Flintstones." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Two-dimensional no more, Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) is the 
dimwitted patriarch of a "modern" Stone Age family living in the city of 
Bedrock. He and wife Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins, pictured right) are best friends 
with Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) and his wife, Betty (Rosie O'Donnell, 
pictured left). 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Rosanna Norton, whose credits include "Robocop 2," 
"Gremlins 2," "Ruthless People," "Airplane!" and "Frankie and Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Tiger, leopard and some mythical prehistoric furs and skins are 
whipped into men's tunics and women's dresses with a definitive late '50s-early 
'60s fashion feeling. Wilma, always in white, favors one-shoulder silhouettes, 
and Betty goes for halters. Everyone is shoeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Semi-Politically Correct: The costumes are made from printed Ultrasuede and 
leather. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemline Watch: Just above the knee, as in the cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I tried to use the cartoon clothes and make them as human as 
possible, which is harder than it seems. (In the cartoon) the women are all 
Barbie dolls, but not as tall, and the men's bodies are little eggs with heads 
and feet. Their clothes were surprisingly abstract," Norton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Besides reels of the original '60s cartoons, Norton turned to 
Vogues and Harper's Bazaars from '61 and '62. For women other than Wilma and 
Betty, she relied on Paris designers Givenchy and Cardin. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Thoughts of adorning Elizabeth Taylor, who plays wealthy Pearl 
Slaghoople, with jewels resembling lumps of coal -- from which diamonds form -- 
were dashed when the coal photographed badly. Instead, Pearl wears jewelry made 
to look as if it were carved from geodes or crystals. 
</P>
<P>
 We Could Live Without: The barefoot gag works only up until a point. When the 
camera offers views of the actors' dirty soles -- ugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: All the costumes, about 1,000, were custom-made in Los Angeles. BETTY

INSIDE OUT: MTV BURNS, BURNS, BURNS OVER CASH CLIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plenty of people have fantasized about shooting uber-thin model Kate Moss 
dead. None of them, however, work for MTV's standards committee. After seeing 
Johnny Cash's new video, "Delia's Gone," officials at the cable channel ordered 
a tamer cut of the deadpan tale, which stars Cash as a coldblooded murderer and 
model Kate Moss as his coldhearted -- and dead -- girlfriend, Delia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they have a thing about dead women," said a spokeswoman for Cash's 
label, American Records. "You can't abuse women when they're dead, or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 What you won't see in the video, which started airing this week on MTV, is a 
shot of Moss tied by a thick rope to a wooden chair that has toppled from the 
force of two gunshots and another shot of Cash -- hair blowing like a madman -- 
shoveling dirt onto Delia's pretty face. (We thought she looked rather 
beautiful.) 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well. An actress has to start somewhere. As the song goes, "Delia's gone, 
one more round, Delia's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 King for a Day: Monday was a fashion marathon in L.A. It started with a lunch 
and show honoring Oscar de la Renta at the Beverly Regent hotel, continued into 
the evening with a cocktail party at the Fahey-Klein gallery in honor of 
Vogue's Grace Coddington and ended with a dinner for De la Renta thrown by 
Barbara Davis -- attended by both Ronald Reagan and Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Before sitting down to lunch, we asked De la Renta his thoughts on Ralph 
Lauren being found guilty in a Paris court of copying Yves Saint Laurent's 
tuxedo gown. De la Renta -- whose fall collection contained nary a tuxedo dress 
-- just shook his beautiful balding head and laughed. "Ridiculous!" he said. 
Then he turned to greet the carefully groomed, exquisitely exercised members of 
the Blue Ribbon. Many had worn their Oscars for the occasion -- and, if all 
went as planned, would head for Saks Fifth Avenue after dessert to buy more. 
</P>
<P>
 We jetted off to the kosher butcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Italy: The buzz in the fashion world this week is over the defection of 
Giorgio Armani's right-hand woman, Gabriella Forte, to Calvin Klein Inc. By all 
accounts, Forte's hiring is a Calvin Klein dream come true. He is said to have 
admired the well-oiled Armani empire for a long time, and not only hired away 
Armani employees but at one point designed similar men's suits. According to 
the controversial new Klein biography, "Obsession," the silhouette of Klein's 
1984 line of suits was so much like Armani's that the Italian designer, on 
seeing Klein's suits in the window of Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, said, "I 
didn't know I had windows at Saks." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Forte's move came as a surprise to Armani. "I don't know anything 
about it," he told Women's Wear Daily on Sunday night. But by Monday the 
designer was well-informed and issued a memo publicly thanking Forte for "her 
15 years of collaboration" and graciously wishing her "every success in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 In her newly created positions of president and chief operating officer at 
Calvin Klein, Forte will oversee the marketing, retailing and licensing 
operations. But it is her proven skills on the international market that likely 
made her irresistible to Klein and partner Barry Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calvin is on a roll this year from a financial and credibility standpoint, 
and this is a real coup for him to steal away one of Armani's key people," 
retail consultant Alan Millstein told the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, the Klein organization is known for its high executive 
turnover and the hands-on -- some might say interfering -- management style of 
its two top bosses. Forte, Millstein said, is "walking into one of the hottest 
snake pits on Seventh Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 Words to Live By: If only we'd read the chapter on "Male Makeovers" in Anka 
Radakovich's new book, "The Wild Girls Club." We might have known better than 
to raise our eyebrows at Mr. Inside Out's weekend party outfit of Topsiders, a 
plaid shirt and a camel-hair jacket. Alongside our cheap rayon cocktail dress 
and Eva Peron pumps, he looked, well, like Father Knows Best -- not entirely 
unappealing, but still. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Radakovich, who counsels hapless hunk wanna-bes each month in Details, knows 
the score on such matters. As she shrewdly observes, "any suggestion that he is 
less than dashing will be taken as an indictment of his whole existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Good advice, but too late, we fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shirt is not plaid," said Mr. Anderson, er, Mr. Inside Out, still 
smarting from our smirking. "It's checked. " 
</P>
<P>
 And What About My Hem Length?: An actress friend went to the DMV to renew her 
driver's license. Her picture was snapped so quickly, she asked, "Is that it?" 
"Yes," said the middle-aged woman who operated the camera. "And it's gonna come 
out cute. But you should get your ears pierced." 
</P>
<P>
 Off With Their Ball Gowns: Instead of black-tie, invitations to the June 8 
benefit for the American Foundation for AIDS Research in New York suggest that 
guests wear anything appropriate to a "summer block party." What makes this a 
bit surprising, we suppose, is that the down-to-earth dress code was the idea 
of Gayfryd Steinberg and Carolyne Roehm, who once personified the 
ballgown-wearing socialites of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to attract a broader constituency than would normally come to one 
of our benefits," Roehm, a fashion designer, told the New York Times. Besides, 
you can't very well listen to an evening of rhythm and blues, as the invitation 
promises, in a crinoline, now can you? 
</P>
<P>
 Charity Begins at Home: Speaking of AIDS fund-raising efforts, Elizabeth 
Taylor sank her tiny little feet into a square of cement mixed with her 
signature White Diamonds perfume this week as part of shoe- meister Kenneth 
Cole's campaign to raise money for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The ritual 
was performed at the recuperating actress's Bel-Air home with doglet Sugar by 
her side. The imprint of Taylor's tootsies joins those of Richard Gere, Rosie 
O'Donnell, Kenny Loggins and Patricia Arquette already in place at Cole's 
Sunset Boulevard store. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to sink into the mud? Madonna. And don't say she already has!

MOURNING LIBERALISM: A REACTIONARY TREATISE; ON LOOKING INTO THE ABYSS; 
UNTIMELY THOUGHTS ON CULTURE AND SOCIETY BY GERTRUDE HIMMELFARB ; ALFRED A. 
KNOPF; $23, 192 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gertrude Himmelfarb is one of those academics who can drive readers up the 
wall. Not because she's obscurantist or pedantic -- in fact she's a fluid 
writer -- but because she's so threatened by non-traditional thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 "On Looking Into the Abyss" is a congenial read for those who admired Allan 
Bloom's "The Closing of the American Mind" and proves more thoughtful than the 
earlier screed, yet the book raises far more questions than it answers. The 
biggest question is easily stated: What is it about recent, relativistic 
scholarship that drives conventional academics so quickly from reasoned debate 
to rigid, defensive disputation? 
</P>
<P>
 The seven essays in this collection, all but one revised versions of 
previously published articles, are not limited to academic thought. But it's 
for good reason that Himmelfarb, an emeritus professor of history at the City 
University of New York, has dedicated the book to the memory of Lionel 
Trilling; he is the book's guiding spirit, for his abiding, high-principled 
belief in the social and cultural importance of "the liberal imagination" ( 
liberal in its older, commendatory sense). 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelfarb, judging from this volume, sees liberalism under siege on today's 
campuses, because everywhere she looks traditional standards are disappearing, 
traditional methods are mocked, traditional values are subverted. 
</P>
<P>
 The "new historians" -- beginning with H.G. Wells -- are antiheroic, intent on 
composing a "history from below" that discredits the "great men" who dominated 
previous accounts of the past. Contemporary postmodern historians admit to 
writing "a kind of propaganda," a description Himmelfarb finds appalling rather 
than honest or provocative.  
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy of neo-pragmatist Richard Rorty "verges on nihilism" in part 
because he adopts some of Heidegger's ideas while passing over his Nazism (an 
ability to separate the life from the work that Himmelfarb later praises, 
incidentally, in Victorian thinkers). And the multiculturalists politicize 
history, as if the decision to write history from one vantage point rather than 
another isn't inherently political. Himmelfarb even criticizes Art Spiegelman's 
Maus books on the Holocaust, which she believes appeal to postmodernists 
because they embrace a kind of amoral aesthetic, a distancing and 
dehumanization of history. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the idea -- the orthodox liberal ways of thinking about the world, the 
ones Himmelfarb practices, are the best ways. With one exception, of course: No 
liberalism allowed when it comes to thinking about liberalism, for here 
Himmelfarb and her band alone hold keys to the kingdom.  
</P>
<P>
 It's extraordinary, really, to find common liberalism coupled to such deep 
conservatism, to such bare-faced authoritarianism, because the postmodernists 
Himmelfarb takes to task aren't supplanting traditional liberalism (although 
many fool themselves into thinking otherwise) so much as supplementing it.  
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, does Himmelfarb find postmodern thought so threatening -- to the 
point that she feels compelled to warn that Rorty's philosophy "may ultimately 
subvert liberal democracy"? Because it says that the emperor of traditional 
objective scholarship, if not exactly buck-naked, isn't nearly as finely 
clothed as he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presumption of postmodernism," Himmelfarb writes, "is that all history is 
fatally flawed, and that because there is no absolute, total truth, there can 
be no partial, contingent truths."  
</P>
<P>
 Some contemporary scholars do take that view, but this definition 
misrepresents the views of many other postmodernists who continue to make 
claims to truth -- but only on a limited and personal basis. (One wonders: Does 
Himmelfarb ignore these thinkers because they are not the "great men" of 
postmodernism, the extremist, high-profile academics?) 
</P>
<P>
 These scholars have come to understand that the writer is incapable of 
transcending private, often unconscious interests, and that those who claim 
transcendence, who brazenly advertise their objectivity, are deluding 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Himmelfarb writes mockingly in her introduction that "On Looking Into the 
Abyss" could be called "The Confessions of an Unregenerate Prig" because it is 
"dedicated to the proposition that there are such things as truth and reality." 
The implication, of course, is that her scholarly opponents are not similarly 
dedicated.  
</P>
<P>
 Most are, in fact, but wear their dedication with a difference: While 
Himmelfarb believes she can see into the heart of things, they continue to look 
for solid ground, believing truth and reality to be elusive, complex and 
subject to multiple, divergent interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 John Milton understood in 1644 what Himmelfarb seems not to 350 years later: 
"The golden rule," he wrote in the "Areopagitica," is not to force belief 
through "the outward union of cold, and neutral, and inwardly divided minds," 
but "to be still searching what we know not by what we know."

 At a recent reunion of the cast of the television series "The Many Loves of 
Dobie Gillis," the actor who played the title role, Dwayne Hickman, said he's 
supporting former co-star Sheila James Kuehl in her bid to become an 
assemblywoman for the 41st district. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kuehl, as all you Dobie fans may recall, played the brainy Zelda 
Gilroy, Dobie's true-blue high school sweetheart on the late-'50s sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman, listed by the county last year as a member of the GOP, is the only 
former cast member who lives in the district, which includes Santa Monica, 
Malibu and the west San Fernando Valley. Steve Franken, who played Chatsworth 
Osborne Jr., is a campaign volunteer for Kuehl but lives just outside the 
district's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard G. Krebs, aka Bob Denver, lives even farther afield. He came in from 
his mountaintop home in West Virginia for last week's reunion, which also 
served as a fund-raiser for Kuehl. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the cast members insisted that Kuehl is just as brainy as the character 
she played so long ago. "She's brilliant and has a great sense of humor," 
Denver said. "I caught her once memorizing the whole script. She said, 'Don't 
tell anyone.' "

 UNDERCOVER COUNCILMAN: Santa Monica City Councilman Kelly Olsen has been out 
again at night trying to catch drug dealers in the act. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, police say, the councilman unwittingly drove his white truck 
right through the middle of a police undercover narcotics surveillance 
operation. Moreover, Olsen was driving on a pedestrian-only beach access road 
at the time, Sgt. Gary Gallinot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen says the police have the wrong man. He acknowledges he was in the area 
earlier this month to observe drug dealing with a reporter from the Outlook 
newspaper. But he says he parked a block away from the site of the surveillance 
operation. What police thought was his truck, he says, was probably a beach 
maintenance vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts the councilman at odds with a lieutenant, a sergeant and several 
other Santa Monica police officers who, Gallinot says, insist it was Olsen who 
drove through the stakeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen has made periodic forays to the Palisades Park area to videotape 
drug-dealing there as part of a crusade to get the city to step up its 
anti-drug efforts. He suggests that his efforts may be rubbing some people the 
wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was made clear to me there was a price to pay for keeping on talking about 
drugs in the park," he said, declining to say who gave him the warning. "If 
this is the price . . . I'm glad to pay it." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen accompanied an Outlook reporter and photographer to the park area on 
several nights this month to show that drug dealing there had not abated 
despite a monthlong sting operation in April. Outlook Executive Editor Patty 
Burnett said neither the reporter nor the photographer was with the councilman 
when the alleged driving incident occurred.

CITY HALL NEWS; ARCADIA; GROUP SEEKS TO INVALIDATE CHANG'S ELECTION 
</P>

<P>
 An Arcadia citizens group has filed a lawsuit contesting Sheng H. Chang's 
victory in last month's City Council race, charging that his campaign committed 
election fraud. Chang has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Arcadia Citizens for Fair Voting, which includes the wife of 
defeated Councilman George Fasching, and Shao Hua Wen, president of the Arcadia 
Chinese Assn., want a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to set aside Chang's 
victory and direct that a new election be held for his four-year seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gathered more than enough evidence of election fraud to contest this 
election," said Geraldine Fasching. But she declined to release details of the 
group's evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Challengers Chang, Mary B. Young and Barbara D. Kuhn won the April 12 vote, in 
which incumbents Joseph C. Ciraulo and Fasching were ousted. Chang, the first 
minority elected to the council, received the most votes, 3,805, including 
1,438 absentee votes after his campaign staged a voter registration drive in 
the city's Asian American community. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk June Alford investigated similar allegations by Carole Ciraulo, 
wife of ousted Councilman Ciraulo, and last week dismissed the claims. Fasching 
said the allegations contained in her group's lawsuit are unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which was filed last Thursday, alleges that Chang's victory was 
because of votes cast by people who did not live in Arcadia and non-citizens. 
It accuses Chang of registering unqualified voters, paying or offering to pay 
for votes, collecting absentee ballots from voters and delivering them to the 
city clerk, which is barred by state law, said Peter Wallin, the group's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued Tuesday, Chang said he won the "election fair and square 
based on the issues." He said it is time to let the new council run Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Fasching said the lawsuit has nothing to do with her husband, who 
has no intention of running if Chang is removed by a judge.

BROOKS' CHARGES AGAINST HARMAN DRAW CRITICISM; POLITICS: CHALLENGER CLAIMS 
HUGHES WORKERS WERE STRONG-ARMED INTO SUPPORTING INCUMBENT. RIVALS CALL 
ALLEGATIONS GROUNDLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks has drawn sharp criticism from 
her rivals in both major political parties after questioning Hughes Aircraft 
Co.'s fund raising for Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, seeking the 36th Congressional District Republican nomination to 
challenge Harman in November, charged that Hughes executives pressured their 
employees into contributing to the congresswoman's reelection campaign at a 
reception held Oct. 29 at the company's Westchester headquarters.  
</P>
<P>
 Harman's district stretches from Venice to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' opponents call the charges groundless, and they characterize her as an 
overzealous campaigner who makes charges without first doing her homework. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of Brooks' claim is a letter that the Hughes Active Citizenship 
Committee sent to Hughes executives on company letterhead.  
</P>
<P>
 Harman is "a friend to our industry, and we can certainly help her get 
reelected," the letter stated, suggesting contribution amounts linked to rank 
in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Chairman C. Michael Armstrong also sent a letter but did not solicit 
financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The order was basically, 'Give, or walk the planks,' " Brooks said at a news 
conference last week. "The implications are there." 
</P>
<P>
 But the letter also stated that contributions are voluntary. Of 240 letters 
sent, only about half the recipients attended the fund-raiser, said Hughes 
spokesman Ray Silvius. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no strong-arming," he said. "We took all precautions and sought the 
advice of outside legal counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Federal Election Commission, which oversees congressional 
races, said they could not comment on Brooks' specific charges. But they cited 
an election rule that allows companies to distribute partisan letters to 
top-level employees and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 At her news conference, Brooks also questioned whether Hughes was reimbursed 
by Harman's campaign for the cost of the fund-raiser. Such reimbursement is 
required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Harman's campaign paid the company $857.46, including $731 for staff 
labor, $16 for company stationery, $10 for badges, $50 for rental of company 
facilities and $50 for other administrative costs, according to finance reports 
and a canceled check to Hughes dated Feb. 9. The campaign also paid $950 to the 
Canteen Corp., which catered the reception. About $20,000 to $25,000 was raised 
at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charges are outright false," said Steve Gray-Barkan, a spokesman for 
Harman's campaign. "Once again, there is egg on (Brooks') face." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Brooks distributed a letter accusing her Republican opponent, 
former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance, of having "a tainted 
business background." Brooks pointed to more than 40 lawsuits that have named 
Florance or one of his companies in the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Florance accused Brooks of distorting the truth and threatened legal 
action. He said that only one of the lawsuits went to trial, and that he 
prevailed. Many of the lawsuits, he said, were frivolous claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Harman are "just another example of Susan shooting from 
the hip, throwing out unsubstantiated, reckless charges without first checking 
all of her facts," said John Carlson, a consultant on the Florance campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brooks' campaign staff plans to file a complaint by early next week 
with the Federal Election Commission about the Harman fund-raiser.

SPECIAL SCHOOL TO CLOSE IN JUNE; EDUCATION: ESCALON CENTER TEACHES AND COUNSELS 
EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED STUDENTS. BUT FINANCIAL WOES FORCE THE DECISION TO SHUT 
DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After several years of scraping by on a dwindling budget, an Altadena school 
that serves the most severely emotionally disturbed students from surrounding 
school districts will close its doors June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1959, the Escalon Center has been teaching students who were branded 
unmanageable in regular classes and special education programs. On an Altadena 
site shaded by orange and lemon trees and graced by a view of the San Gabriel 
Mountains, 75 students learn academic basics in classes with a 5-1 ratio of 
students to teachers. They also receive counseling for the problems that 
brought them here. 
</P>
<P>
 But a chain of financial crises is forcing the school to close this year, to 
the dismay of students who have enjoyed the tranquil setting and individualized 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about the best school I've ever seen," said Vickie Williams, whose 
10-year-old son, Jeff, is legally blind and suffers from behavioral problems 
related to his deteriorating vision.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff, due to his vision, becomes very frustrated and angry," she said. 
"Public schools aren't set up to deal with kids they can't control all the 
time. . . . At Escalon, he was excited. His first day he came home and said, 
'Mom, they actually taught me math. I got to read and write. I got to play 
softball, basketball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Escalon is a private nonprofit school funded by donations, grants and payments 
from school districts whose students it serves -- Pasadena, Burbank, Glendale 
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grants and donations have dried up because of the recession, Escalon 
Director Nancy Davidson said. Two thrift stores that benefited the school went 
bankrupt. And the center has not received cost-of-living increases from the 
cash-strapped school districts in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the center receives about $2,000 per student per month, it is not 
enough to pay for the high number of staff per student, the behavioral 
specialist, counselors, vocational training program and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, Davidson said, the average age of students has dropped 
and their disorders have become more severe. Before, Escalon primarily served 
students with learning disabilities. Now its students include those with 
prenatal substance abuse syndrome and teen-agers involved in gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has driven up the cost of educating them, but it has not driven up the 
reimbursement," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school districts that send students to Escalon will decide with the 
parents where the children will go next. Some will attend other private 
schools. Others will return to public school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that when a student is given (money to attend a special school), the 
point of it is to get students to the point where they can come back to a 
public school -- it is not to fund them forever," said Jane Stone, director of 
special education for the Pasadena Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 A few students, including Chris Davis, 18, are graduating. Davis, who said he 
has emotional problems, has attended Escalon for three years and plans to 
enroll in Glendale Community College next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this place hadn't been around when I was here, I wouldn't be graduating 
and going to college," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Anaya and Jerry Figueroa, both 18, are near-casualties of gang warfare 
who found refuge at Escalon. Both participated in gangs in their previous high 
schools. Anaya was stabbed with a screwdriver. Figueroa was stabbed and shot.  
</P>
<P>
 "Right here you can't get jumped," Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaya agreed. "It's safe. When you need help, they come and help you." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaya and Figueroa will return to public schools next year. They said they are 
not worried about gang problems because they will attend different high schools 
than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Their teacher, Karla Thomas, is not sure it will be that easy. "It's too bad 
the school's closing," she said. "The system's working against us. We're trying 
to save our children, but we're losing the race."

ALTADENA, SOUTH PASADENA LIBRARY DISTRICTS SEEK TAX HIKE; REFERENDUM: BACKERS 
SAY THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT BUT NEED TO GET VOTERS TO THE POLLS. REQUIRED 
TWO-THIRDS' APPROVAL IS AN OBSTACLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Less than two weeks before Election Day, proponents of library taxes in 
Altadena and South Pasadena say they have vocal and moral support -- but they 
need to convert that into votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to win this election, we must just get out the vote June 7," said 
Jan Wetzel, 66, chairman of Committee to Protect our Library, at a 
carnival-like rally on South Pasadena Library's lawn last weekend attended by 
more than 150 library supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetzel said his main concern is the two-thirds' approval required for passage. 
"We need two positive votes for every one negative vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Soltes, a consultant hired by the Save Our Altadena Library committee, 
said telephone surveys show residents 12 to 1 in support of a library tax. 
"We've now got to make sure they all vote," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Altadena's Proposition A would cost an extra $29 a year for a single-family 
homeowner, $20 for an apartment owner and $59 to $79 for a commercial unit. 
That would add up to $430,000 to restore the library to 1991 service levels. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena's Proposition L would raise $219,500 a year to maintain library 
services by charging homeowners $29 to $48 a year, based on square footage. 
Apartment owners would pay $12 per unit and businesses $24 to $96. 
</P>
<P>
 Both communities' taxes would stay in effect for five years. Low-income 
homeowners would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetzel said the campaign in South Pasadena has raised $14,000 and recruited a 
volunteer army of precinct walkers. In the last week, more than 350 lawn signs 
were placed at strategic sites throughout the 24,000-resident community. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city leaders have endorsed the measure; the council put it on the ballot. 
Also supporting the tax is Bristol Farms, a food market that is among the 
city's larger businesses. More than 6,000 absentee ballots have been mailed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents are spreading the message that South Pasadena Library will lose 
$80,000 of its $987,000 budget if voters reject the measure. The library would 
close three days a week; it is now open daily. In addition, 14 part-timers 
would be laid off and all special programs canceled. "We'd be down to the 
basics," said City Librarian Mary Lou Wigley. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. opposes the measure because it would 
collect revenue only from property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Cook, association spokesman, said the group would have preferred a 1% 
utility tax increase on the ballot. The association in recent weeks has 
attacked the measure in newspaper advertisements highlighting the librarian's 
salary and high cost per resident compared to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has the money for library services but spends it on other items, the 
association said. The group pointed to the city's costly lobbying against the 
Long Beach Freeway extension. More than $112,000 in pay raises, the group 
noted, had been given to City Hall management. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the association opposition, a school improvement tax failed twice 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In Altadena, the library tax faces no formal opposition and has the added 
advantage of Soltes, a hired consultant. The campaign has reaped the benefit, 
banking $35,000. Soltes will be paid $6,000 to $8,000, depending on the amount 
eventually raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign has sent absentee ballots to half the 24,000 registered voters 
and has invested in state-of-the-art mailers and cable television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said they have wide-ranging endorsements, from conservative County 
Supervisor Michael Antonovich to the Altadena chapter of the National 
Association for Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antonovich's endorsement shows that saving the Altadena library goes beyond 
routine politics and political philosophies," said Reynolds Cafferata, campaign 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in 1983 a similar measure in the library district failed. The 
committee has also fallen short of its goal of a $55,000 campaign chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Altadena librarian Bill Tema said the library's budget in the last two years 
has decreased from $1.4 million to $882,360. Library officials have used the 
library reserves during the past few years to delay cuts. Since October, the 
library has closed on Sundays and Tuesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure fails, the main library would close two of six days it is now 
open. The branch library would be open two days instead of five. Said Tema: "We 
simply can't afford to lose."

CAMPAIGNING HEATS UP IN 49TH DISTRICT PRIMARY RACE; POLITICS: JUDY CHU ATTACKS 
INCUMBENT DIANE MARTINEZ AS INEFFECTIVE AND UNABLE TO RETAIN STAFF. THE 
FRESHMAN ASSEMBLYWOMAN DENOUNCES THE CRITICISM AS RUMORMONGERING. 
</P>

<P>
 Fanning the flames of her underdog campaign, Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu has 
intensified her attack on Assemblywoman Diane Martinez, calling her an 
ineffective legislator who cannot get bills passed or even hold on to her 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (D-Monterey Park) gave Chu new ammunition when she brought up one of 
her most closely watched bills for a vote last week -- only to have it fall one 
vote short of passage. The bill would have helped clear the way for Caltrans to 
extend the Long Beach (710) Freeway through South Pasadena without approval of 
the city, which is a vehement opponent of the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's 49th District includes parts of Alhambra, which strongly supports 
the extension, as well as portions of Monterey Park, San Gabriel, Rosemead, 
Temple City, El Monte, Los Angeles and unincorporated East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before the freeway vote, three members of Martinez's six-person 
Sacramento staff left her office for reasons that are unclear. Two of the 
employees, an analyst and a secretary, apparently left on bad terms after a 
fierce argument with the assemblywoman, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is ineffective in Sacramento," Chu said in a recent interview. "She can't 
even keep her staff. How can you operate your office with that kind of 
turnover?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez denied there was a staff blowup, saying the analyst left of her own 
accord and the secretary left to seek lighter duty because of her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband of Danielle Woern, who is pregnant and one of the employees who 
reportedly argued with Martinez, answered a phone call from The Times but would 
not allow his wife to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst, Linda Joplin, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblywoman also downplayed the importance of the vote on the 710 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the votes are there," said Martinez, who has scheduled the bill for 
reconsideration. "I don't intend to lose this bill." Then Martinez fired back 
at Chu. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always set on the track of deliberately skewing information," Martinez 
said. "She has people here and there and everywhere trying to spread rumors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Martinez/Chu race is drawing particular interest because it pits a Latina 
incumbent, who has the blessing of Democratic leaders, against a well-financed 
Chinese American candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chu, a college psychology professor, is fighting an uphill battle against 
Martinez, a freshman assemblywoman and the daughter of Rep. Matthew G. Martinez 
(D-Monterey Park). 
</P>
<P>
 The district is considered one of the best for Asian candidates because of its 
growing Asian population. But Latinos still account for about 55% of the 
population; Asians make up 29% -- a clear advantage for the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 A third candidate, Roy T. Torres, is running for election in the June 7 
Democratic primary, but his campaign is under-funded and his chances are seen 
as poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican George H. Nirschl III is running unopposed in the GOP primary but 
is expected to have little chance in November; Democrats outnumber Republicans 
in the 49th District by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian Kim Goldsworthy also is seeking the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In area races for state Senate, the Democratic primary in the 24th District is 
drawing the most interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) wants to move to the upper house, 
but first she must defeat former Azusa Mayor Eugene F. Moses. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat was created through reapportionment in 1992 and approximates the old 
seat held by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who is running for state 
Insurance Commissioner. The 24th District includes all or part of Alhambra, 
Arcadia, Azusa, Baldwin Park, El Monte, Hacienda Heights, Industry, Irwindale, 
La Puente, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel, West Covina and La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses, 60, has been eyeing the seat for more than a year and built up a 
sizable campaign war chest, raising about $70,000 through last March. Solis 
reported raising about $31,000 through March. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having less money, Solis is viewed as the favorite by pundits because 
she is an incumbent, who therefore enjoys higher name recognition and has the 
capacity to raise more money before June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, 36, has won the endorsements of Latino political heavyweights such as 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina. That she is a Latina running in a 
district where Latinos account for 54% of registered Democrats is also to her 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 A third Democratic contender, Joseph R. Chavez, a data processing supervisor, 
said he plans to raise about $5,000 for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Dave Boyer and Libertarian George Curtis Feger face no opposition 
on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Democratic primary is expected to win in November. Democrats 
account for 58% of the registered voters in the 24th District, compared with 
29% for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Montebello) faces no opposition in the Democratic 
primary to retain his 30th District seat, which represents part of South El 
Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Republicans are vying for a chance to face Calderon in November -- Araceli 
Gonzalez, a theater group manager, and Ken Gow, a retired aerospace engineer. 
But the two candidates admit it will be difficult to unseat Calderon in a 
district where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The primaries for the Senate's 32nd District, which includes part of Pomona, 
are uncontested. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Democrats are campaigning for the Assembly's 57th District, which is 
being vacated by Solis. The district includes all or part of Azusa, Baldwin 
Park, El Monte, Glendora, Industry, Irwindale, La Puente, South El Monte, West 
Covina and the county areas of Bassett, Hacienda Heights and Valinda. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Gallegos, a Baldwin Park councilman, and Tony Fellow, a college 
professor, are considered the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegos, a chiropractor, has received a number of key endorsements, including 
that of the state Democratic Party and two area congressmen and state senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow has the support of former Assemblywoman Sally Tanner and numerous local 
officials. He also has the support of the California Orthopedic Assn., an 
organization of surgeons who do not want to see a chiropractor in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign took a negative turn recently when Fellow's campaign released 
documents showing state and federal liens against Gallegos' chiropractic clinic 
for failing to pay employee and income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegos said that the state liens resulted from a misclassification of an 
employee and that the federal lien, which was imposed and cleared last month, 
was a result of hard financial times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough time, but we made it through," Gallegos said. "Being a veteran 
of coming out of this recession gives me more insight into what we need to do 
for the people of this state." 
</P>
<P>
 The third candidate in the Democratic primary is La Puente Councilman Charles 
H. (Charlie) Storing. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Frank Yik and Libertarian David Carl Argall are running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) faces a weak challenge from 
mortgage broker Robert L. Smith in the Republican primary for the 60th 
District, all or part of Covina, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, Industry, 
Pomona, Walnut, West Covina, La Habra Heights, La Mirada and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher is expected to easily defeat Smith, who has raised little money and 
lacks the endorsements of Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Andrew M. (Andy) Ramirez and Libertarian Michael L. Welte are running 
unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong Republican registration in the 60th District makes Horcher the favorite 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The primaries in the 44th, 58th, 59th and 61st Assembly districts are 
uncontested.

GRAFFITI; OFF THE STREET AND INTO THE ART GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people decry graffiti and demand stiffer penalties for those who do it. 
The Social and Public Art Resource Center is taking a different tack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice center has turned its gallery space over to three graffiti-style 
artists, Erick (Duke) Montenegro, Joseph (Nuke) Montalvo and Tony Quan, 
allowing them to curate an exhibit of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit "Notes From the Other Side," opening Saturday, will feature the 
works of 12 artists, including Montenegro, Montalvo and Quan. Besides 
graffiti-style paintings, the show will include photographs of graffiti and the 
video documentary, "Three Voices on Graffiti," by artist Paul Kanemitsu. And 
visitors will be allowed to paint on a wall set up in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the spray-can work is the most interesting new work from a 
next generation of mural painters," said Judith Baca, a muralist and the 
center's artistic director. "We have a responsibility as the generation that 
preceded them to support the new talent. What I see is enormous talent and very 
few venues for this work to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The artists are in their 20s and paint in what they call the Eastside L.A. 
style. "The Eastside (is) not so much a place, but a state of mind of a type of 
culture, inner-city L.A. culture, predominantly Latino but mixed with other 
cultures such as Asian," Quan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Everybody started off as a graffiti artist, but since then people 
have taken different routes. There's examples of mainstream painting (in the 
exhibit), and there's stuff that's still hard-core graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what we try to say in our work has been neglected for a long time," 
he said. "With the media bombardment focusing on graffiti as a crime and tag 
bangers and killing, they've taken away from the artistic side, and younger 
kids have seen that that's how they can get on TV -- by getting fame from 
killing. When graffiti started off, it was never about that. It was about doing 
the art, and we feel it should be back toward that." 
</P>
<P>
 Quan's interest in graffiti and art began when he was in junior high. "I 
always saw graffiti everywhere," he said. "I lived in East L.A. and graffiti 
was something I could relate to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one thing that unified all of us is that graffiti as an art form 
spoke to us in a way that other forms of art didn't. It spoke to the reality of 
what I and my friends knew, and from there it was a steppingstone to other 
things. I got introduced to mainstream art through graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 artists, four, including Quan, have bachelor's degrees in fine arts. 
Two are students at Otis Art Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the 12 are also exhibiting their works in the Museum of Contemporary 
Art's exhibition, "Urban Revisions." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I turned toward the art classes at my high school, they really failed 
me," Montalvo said. "Graffiti was the exchange of ideas, actually sitting down 
in a circle of friends and learning from each other. In that way, graffiti 
nurtured the artist already in me. Maybe you didn't have access to oils or 
canvases or 20,000 different brushes. There was only two things -- your wall 
and paint. It was so easily accessible and the freedom was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, there were some sites where authorities looked the 
other way and let these young men paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late '80s, there must have been five or six places where we could go, 
where it was somewhat legal but illegal, but we could go there, we could paint 
and it was no problem," said Kanemitsu, son of the late artist, Matsumi 
Kanemitsu. "Now I can only think of one. That shows how it's been shut down." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people, like the anti-graffiti coalitions, say, 'Why don't you try 
and get legal spaces?' " Quan said. "What they don't tell you is in the 
mid-'80s we did go before the City Council and ask them to set aside some 
vacant lots for us to paint, and they laughed us off. So now they act shocked 
when there's a lot of graffiti on the streets and a lot of gang violence. They 
don't give us any positive outlets." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanemitsu and artist Gajin Fujita, who is also in the show, believe reckless 
tagging -- unartistic scrawls on walls, bus benches and street signs -- has 
mushroomed in part because there are virtually no sanctioned yards where kids 
can go and paint. "These taggers are much younger than us -- teens," Fujita 
said. "When I see freeway signs getting hit up, it's very irritating to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "People will do a piece, spend a couple of days on something. Someone will go 
the next day and go over it in something that will take like a half-hour or 
even a minute," Kanemitsu said. "That just shows the lack of respect that kids 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Quan believes that he and his peers are in a position to speak to the younger 
generation. "The question is, how can I, as an older person, direct them in a 
positive path," he said. "I don't really have any answers to that, but maybe 
they can look at my example. We got a space here where we can show some art. 
But this is the exception, not the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the show include Rojelio Cabral, Victor Espinosa, Joaquin 
Larios, Randy Legaspi, Ruben Mireles, Abel Perez and Jose Reza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notes From the Other Side" opens with a reception on Saturday from 6 to 9 
p.m. at the Social and Public Art Resource Center, 685 Venice Blvd., Venice. 
"Circle Discussion": Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m. Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Monday through Friday, and noon to 4 p.m. the first and third Saturdays of 
the month. Show ends July 15. Information: (310) 822-9560.

BRIEFLY: EDUCATION: TEACHER FINALIST FOR AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Venice High School math teacher has been named a finalist for the Jaime 
Escalante Mathematics Teacher of the Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Lockett and 10 other finalists will receive $1,000 each during a 
reception Friday at the ARCO Tower in Downtown Los Angeles. The winner of the 
$1,500 teacher of the year award will be announced at the reception. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is sponsored by the Los Angeles Educational Partnership and the ARCO 
Foundation and has been given since 1989. Escalante taught math at a high 
school in East Los Angeles, and his success with students once considered 
underachievers was the subject of a feature film, "Stand and Deliver."

BRIEFLY: VETERANS AFFAIRS: ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' West Los Angeles Medical Center has 
joined forces with the Salvation Army to create an emergency services program 
for homeless veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called HAVEN (Helping Assist Veterans with Emergency Needs), was 
dedicated on Tuesday by Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown. It is intended 
to provide temporary housing for homeless veterans and help them become 
self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men and women who fought for freedom should not have to live on the streets," 
Brown said in a statement issued Tuesday. "I consider this an absolute 
priority."

HISTORY; MILES OF MEMORIES ON ROUTE 66; THE ROAD IS CRACKED AND THE INTERSTATE 
HAS BYPASSED IT. BUT MANY STILL GATHER TO MOTOR BACK AND RECAPTURE THE ROMANCE 
OF THE HIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN GRIFFITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Waldmire has traveled Route 66 end to end more times than he can count. 
He drove to the annual gathering Saturday of the California Historic Route 66 
Assn. from Hackberry, Ariz., in his orange Volkswagen bus, "my mansion on 
wheels," which he has decorated with hand-painted maps and pasted with stickers 
and postcards -- 66 postcards, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldmire was at the group's meeting at the Aztec Hotel in Monrovia (on Route 
66, of course) to sell his pen-and-ink drawings of the highway, the fruits of 
four years traveling and drawing its interconnected roads. 
</P>
<P>
 His father invented the corn dog on a stick, he says, and sold them from a 
drive-in in Springfield, Ill., that in 1991 was inducted into the Route 66 Hall 
of Fame. "I guess I inherited my mom and dad's intermittent intertwining with 
the route," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1926, Route 66 was the road Steinbeck's Dust Bowl migrants traveled 
during the Depression and it was the main artery for troop movement during 
World War II. It was America's first paved interstate highway, beginning near 
Lake Michigan in Illinois and ending at the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now just a stretch of road, completely bypassed by larger highways in 
1984, but immortalized by songs and in the popular 1960s "Route 66" television 
series about two young men on a continual road trip. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 300 or so roadside worshipers sitting behind tables of Route 66 
T-shirts and information pamphlets Saturday, the old interstate is more than 
miles of concrete, cracked or buried in places after years of official neglect. 
 
</P>
<P>
 It's a journey they took many times years ago, a jaunt they still take, and it 
represents the history of American highway glory, car culture and family-owned 
motor hotels painted in pastels. And memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Petrolania," Bob Lundy calls it. A derivative of petrol and mania, he says it 
is a "generic name for memorabilia associated with vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Route 66 museum he founded in Rancho Cucamonga, there is a late 1950s 
Phillips 66 gas pump, set at 19.9 cents a gallon. There are old auto parts and 
scenes along its San Bernardino County stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the Fontana Preservation Society proudly tell about the 
original orange juice stand they restored in a corner of a Wal-Mart parking lot 
along Route 66. It is a bright orange ball with holes for windows and a door. 
</P>
<P>
 Assn. President Geoffrey Willis wants the decaying buildings along the road 
restored and more road markers designating the route. 
</P>
<P>
 "The romance of the road is what it makes us do," Willis said. "The whole 
point is to get off the highway, slow down and pay attention to what's around 
you."

<P>
 The "Nigerian Nightmare" is making a comeback in retail. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Okoye, the NFL's leading rusher in 1989, opened Christian Okoye 
Sports in Asuza recently.The former Kansas City Chiefs running back, nicknamed 
the Nigerian Nightmare in honor of his African homeland and his bruising 
running style, said he had always dreamed of opening an apparel store.  
</P>
<P>
 Okoye, who came to Azusa Pacific University from Nigeria on a track 
scholarship in 1982, reflected upon his decision to locate the store near his 
old haunts: "This area is growing. I thought it was a good location. I've 
always wanted to open a sports apparel store and I thought it would be nice to 
open it so close to my old school." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Emmanuel Okoye, said Okoye Sports will sell officially licensed 
sports apparel and merchandise. The store will not carry sporting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Okoye missed last season with knee problems. He also recently 
underwent back surgery. Emmanuel Okoye said his brother is fully recovered and 
working out in hopes of joining an NFL team.

ENVIRONMENT; VOLUNTEER HELP SOUGHT FOR FOREST CLEANUP PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed for two upcoming projects to clear brush and litter in 
local nature areas. 
</P>
<P>
 This Saturday, the U.S. Forest Service and other organizations are sponsoring 
a trail-maintenance day from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Crystal Lake Recreation 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will meet at the Deer Flats Campground north of Crystal Lake and 
will go from there to help remove fallen trees, install water bars to control 
runoff, and perform other maintenance on the Big Cienega, Lost Ridge and Windy 
Gap trails. The Forest Service will provide the tools and free camping over 
Memorial Day weekend to all participants, and each volunteer will receive a 
commemorative T-shirt. For more information, call Heather Smith at (909) 
592-2095. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Saturday, June 4, the Forest Service, county parks department 
and several other agencies and organizations are sponsoring Operation Super 
Sweep, a major litter cleanup project in the San Gabriel Canyon, which has been 
plagued by litter problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Free food, drinks, T-shirts, entertainment and prizes will be offered to 
participants, who will be organized into teams and shuttled between the staging 
area at Rincon Fire Station and the various cleanup areas throughout the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash bags will be provided, but volunteers are asked to bring their own 
gardening gloves, hats and sensible shoes. They should wear brightly colored 
shirts to ensure safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration at the station is from 7:30 to 9 a.m., with the cleanup 
continuing through 11 a.m. Lunch will be served until 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rincon Fire Station is located on Highway 39 (Azusa Boulevard), north of 
Sierra Madre Boulevard. For more information, call (818) 575-5488 or 335-1251.

 Sheriff's deputies say they still don't know whether the drive-by killings 
Monday of two 18-year-olds were gang-related, but the circumstances in the case 
indicate gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were shot to death when they stopped their gray Cadillac at a 
traffic light, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Thompson of Altadena and Demon Stephenson of Pasadena were shot by at 
least one of three occupants of a two-toned green Cadillac that pulled 
alongside them about 3 p.m. at Lake Avenue and New York Drive, Sheriff's Lt. 
Ray Peavy said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, the passenger, apparently recognized someone or something and 
jumped out of the car he was riding in, sheriff's deputies said. He was hit 
once in the torso and collapsed on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, the driver, was hit in the back of the head and in the upper torso, 
deputies said. He managed to drive the car 150 feet north on Lake before he 
collapsed and slumped over. Stephenson was taken to Huntington Memorial 
Hospital in Pasadena, where he was pronounced dead at 3:52 p.m.; Thompson was 
taken to St. Lukes Medical Center in Pasadena, where he was pronounced dead at 
4:12 p.m. The suspects were last seen headed east on New York Drive, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Hart, owner of the 98 Cents Store in a Lake Avenue mini-mall, said he 
was talking with a customer when he heard about four shots. "I thought the 
children were playing," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Ford, who was in the area at the time of the shooting, said he heard the 
sound of rapid shots and saw Stephenson jump out of the car. Thompson was still 
driving through the intersection, Ford said, but the car slowed as the drive 
began to lose consciousness.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; RESIDENTS DECRY CHAIN-SAW MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Zollo knows what sweeping government authority sounds like. It's the 
noise a chain saw makes as it chews through a ficus tree on Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Zollo and other Hollywood residents expressed outrage last week when Los 
Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority workers chopped down 31 large 
ficus trees near Hollywood and Vine as part of a project to build a Metro Rail 
subway stop. That the transit agency gave residents less than 24 hours' notice, 
he said, was the unkindest cut of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trees are not like furniture," said Zollo, a musician and journalist. "If 
they get in the way, you don't just get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials said that because of special exemptions granted to 
MTA over two years ago, the transit agency was not required to hold public 
hearings over the tree removal. Nevertheless, Councilwoman member Jackie 
Goldberg plans to introduce a motion next week to curb the agency's power to 
landscape without hearing from residents. In the coming months, construction 
work will begin on two more subway stations on the boulevard, at Highland and 
Western avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew (the trees) would be removed, but not chopped down," said Veronica 
Gutierrez, an aide to Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Chesser, an MTA spokesman, said the agency discussed replanting the 
ficus trees in another location but rejected the idea because the roots were 
too extensive. He added that the agency would landscape the Hollywood-and-Vine 
area with Mexican fan palms and ficus trees at the subway stop's scheduled 1998 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The ficus fracas comes amid a larger struggle between city officials and 
Hollywood residents, some of whom have vigorously opposed both Metro Rail 
construction and longstanding government attempts to redevelop the 
neighborhood. Just last year, local activists bitterly complained when the 
Community Redevelopment Agency removed ficus trees along the boulevard as part 
of a beautification effort. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials could not immediately confirm the age of those ficus trees, but 
Bobbie Green, a superintendent for the Department of Public Works, said they 
have grown there for at least 30 years. He was unsure whether they had been 
originally planted by the city or residents, but noted that boulevard merchants 
pay the city to have the trees trimmed twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under city laws, Green said, anyone wishing to remove a tree must obtain a 
permit, a process that involves inspections and public hearings and can take 
longer than 60 days. Yet the public works department agreed to exempt MTA from 
that requirement in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to cooperate with Metro Rail and expedite their 
(construction) requests," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zollo and other residents said they knew nothing of the exemption, and did not 
learn of the planned tree removal until May 16, the morning the cutting 
occurred, when MTA workers posted flyers dated the previous Friday. Chesser 
said public meetings had been held previously on the subject of tree removal 
but he could not immediately provide details. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just proves our point," said longtime activist Robert Nudelman. MTA, he 
said, has "no interest in keeping people informed; they just want to do 
whatever they want, whenever they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said that Goldberg, in her motion next week, will ask Public Works 
to rescind the MTA exemption in an effort to prevent tree removal at the 
Highland and Western avenues stops. In the meantime, Hollywood residents are 
left contemplating their newly denuded corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "These trees provided oxygen and shade," said Zollo, "both of which Hollywood 
Boulevard desperately needs."

</P>
<P>
 After receiving a bachelor's degree from McPherson College in McPherson, Kan., 
Fasnacht, who lived in La Verne, spent eight years in the public school system 
of Wiley, Colo., where he worked as a teacher, principal and superintendent. He 
then served as business manager and associate dean at Colorado Women's College. 
</P>
<P>
 Fasnacht was named president of the University of La Verne in 1948. That year, 
McPherson College awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, Fasnacht encouraged faculty to obtain doctorates, 
established an office of public relations and upgraded school facilities. In 
1980, Fasnacht received an honorary doctorate of humane letters and in 1986 a 
chair of religion was established in his name. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Ruth, daughters Glenda Jimmink and Elaine Miles 
and two grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
 His family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the 
Harold D. Fasnacht Chair of Religion at the university.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; LANDLORD'S PETITION SEEKS TO PAY DEPARTING 
TENANTS, END RENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of one of the largest apartment buildings in Santa Monica is 
circulating a petition that would allow landlords to raise rents to market 
rates after paying $10,000 to departing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by Lawrence Kates, owner of Santa Monica Shores, a twin-tower 
development with more than 500 apartment units, was immediately criticized by 
renters as well as other landlords, two groups that are rarely in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most landlords, who are too financially strained and stressed by rent 
control, won't be able to (pay $10,000)," said Carl Lambert, a landlord and 
property owner in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I can see, the only person benefiting from it is the person 
circulating it," said Robert Sullivan, a partner in Sullivan Dituri Realty, one 
of the largest real estate and property management companies in the city. "It 
really just shows how desperate some people have gotten to get out from under 
rent control." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Rent Control Board and Santa Monica Renters Rights, a 
renters' rights advocacy group, dismissed the measure as a bribe scheme meant 
to dismantle rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most underhanded things I've seen the anti-control people 
do," said Lisa Monk Borrino, a board member and a tenants' rights attorney. 
"They're trying to get tenants to vote against their own best interests. And I 
don't think landlords would pay it because it would take them about four years 
to make it up in rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Greenstein, co-chair of Santa Monica Renters Rights, said her 
organization is advising renters not to sign the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kates) is playing on the worst in people and trying to buy them off," 
Greenstein said. "But renters will see through it. We've survived 15 years of 
landlords trying different initiatives, and I think they underestimate renters 
in Santa Monica. We're not greedy. It'll probably make it on the ballot, and if 
it is, we'll fight it as part of the rest of our campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition is being circulated by a group called Santa Monica Fresh Start, 
which has mailed 44,000 petitions and lobbied Santa Monica residents by 
telephone, hoping to put the measure on the ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The signatures of 15% of the city's registered voters, about 8,790 people, 
must be gathered by mid-June before the measure can qualify on the ballot, 
according to the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Kates, owner of Wilshire Property Management in Los Angeles, referred calls 
from The Times to his political consultant, George Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kates) sees the entire city decaying, especially the rental housing 
inventory," said Young, who has worked on political campaigns for Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This provides incentive for landlords to upgrade their units and get back 
into the rental market at fair market value," he said. "You can't compete with 
the rental market in Los Angeles if you aren't able to raise rents." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica is no stranger to such proposals. In 1983, the so-called HOME 
(Home Ownership Made Easy) Initiative was presented to voters, financially 
backed by a number of landlords, including Kates. The initiative would have 
allowed renters to buy their apartments, but it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the Tenant Ownership Rights Charter Amendment (TORCA) was 
passed, allowing apartments to be converted to condominiums if two-thirds of 
tenants agree to the conversion and half agree to buy them. TORCA also 
guarantees rent control protection for the remaining units. 
</P>
<P>
 But still bigger threats are hanging over Santa Monica's rent control law. A 
statewide decontrol bill sponsored by Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) and 
Bernie Richter (R-Chico) would also allow rents to move to market levels upon 
vacancy, making the municipal ballot moot. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Young said that if the state legislation is passed, Santa 
Monica Fresh Start will confer with lawyers about whether they should continue 
their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the petition is an attempt to cash in on the desperation of tenants 
displaced by the Northridge earthquake, Young said there is no connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a straightforward, single proposal that voters can understand," 
Young said, "and it's not a landlord proposal in the organizational sense. We 
didn't go to either group -- landlords or renters." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Santa Monica has one of the strictest rent control laws in the 
country, with base rents pegged to 1978 levels. Rents can be raised by 3% 
annually. They may also be raised if a building's rents are below the city's 
median rates and if a capital improvement has been made, said Cass Ben-Levi, 
senior operations analyst for the Rent Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The average two-bedroom rental in the Santa Monica Shores apartments, located 
between Main Street and the beach, goes for about $742, according to 1992 Santa 
Monica rent control records. One local realtor estimated that such units would 
go for about $1,500 a month on the open market.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; FIRM GETS AWARD FOR SEISMIC WORK ON BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco engineering firm De Leuw, Cather & Co. was named an honor 
award winner in the American Consulting Engineers Council's annual Engineering 
Excellence Award competition.The company was recognized for its seismic 
rehabilitation work on the Colorado Street bridge over the Arroyo Seco in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,468-foot bridge, an early example of 20th-Century reinforced concrete 
arch bridge construction, was closed to traffic in 1989 because of safety 
concerns. Because the bridge is on the National Register of Historic Places, 
the company had to preserve its historic integrity while using seismically 
resistant new materials to strengthen it. The company was recently honored, 
along with other award honorees, at the council's annual convention in Orlando, 
Fla.

COMMUNITY NEWS: POMONA; GIRL WITH GENE DISORDER NEEDS MARROW DONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since infancy, 4-year-old Shafon Seeden has fought an extremely rare malady 
whose very name -- mucopolysaccharidosis, type 6, maroteaux/lamy syndrome -- is 
probably unpronounceable for the dark-eyed, Pomona preschooler. Doctors at 
County USC Medical Center say they've seen only two cases of the disorder in 
the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic disorder causes a carbohydrate to accumulate in the body, 
resulting in bone disfigurement, organ swelling and congested lungs, doctors 
say. Lacking the enzyme to break down the carbohydrate, Shafon's body could 
give out in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But doctors are hoping a bone marrow transplant could prolong Shafon's life. 
Two Los Angeles churches last weekend held donor drives for Shafon. They 
registered 35 potential donors, said Barbara Wilks of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Many more are needed. None of Shafon's family members have blood plasma that 
matches the child's. African Americans have a higher probability of matching, 
but they make up only 5% of the 1.2-million people registered nationwide with 
the Red Cross' bone marrow program, Wilks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donor information: (800) MARROW2.

eight sports, including tennis, gymnastics, cycling and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 At the fund-raiser Friday, attended by about 300 people, California Special 
Olympics gave Distinguished Volunteer Service Awards to Georgiana Rae, a 
special education teacher in the Garden Grove Unified School District, and Marc 
Kelly, a physical education teacher at Lanterman High School, a special 
education facility in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are coaches in the Special Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, written by Buddy Farmer, celebrates the lives, triumphs and 
challenges of three of football's greatest coaches: Bear Bryant, Vince Lombardi 
and Knute Rockne.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrific match for us," said Greg Bingham, executive director of the 
California Special Olympics. "The play celebrates the inspiration coaches 
provide their players. Our motto is: Training for life is what Special Olympics 
is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi, played by John Pinero, delivers his philosophy during a locker room 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young man," he tells the squad, "somewhere deep down inside you is a burning 
desire to excel. If you don't believe that then pack your bags. . . . But if 
you leave with the knowledge that you didn't give it every ounce of strength in 
your body to do your best, then you will quit on everything you do in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hoffman, 33, of Fullerton, who has represented California and the United 
States at international and national Special Olympics, said Lombardi's message 
of achievement and pride mirrors the Special Olympics creed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do anything for this program, because the Special Olympics has given 
me the confidence to be myself and the chance to prove to other people that . . 
. the mentally retarded can do what anyone else can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, who works as an equipment manager at Troy High School in Fullerton, 
was named Most Inspirational Athlete at the 1993 statewide games.

COVER STORY; PICKING UP THE TRAIL OF LOST CIVILIZATIONS; ARCHEOLOGISTS GET 
VOLUNTEER HELP AS THEY UNEARTH CLUES IN SITES NESTLED THROUGHOUT THE ANGELES 
NATIONAL FOREST 
</P>

<P>
 Retired police Lt. Doug Collisson always loved a good mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, deep in the Angeles National Forest, the dogged 49-year-old is on the 
trail of perhaps the biggest whodunit of his life -- with 4,000-year-old clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Collisson is part of a volunteer archeological crew, snooping for the secrets 
of these ancient woods. The archeological team is trying to reconstruct the 
past, much the way Collisson once did on the homicide beat in South Los 
Angeles. But this time, he and other history buffs are trying to solve 
mysteries of antiquity: 
</P>
<P>
 What Native American tribes lived and died in the San Gabriel Mountains? Did 
they head for the mountains only in the balmy days of spring so they could make 
tents out of the blooming yucca plants and grass mats, and to beat the wily 
squirrels to the pine nuts? Or at other times of the year as well? 
</P>
<P>
 What did they trade to get their precious obsidian, volcanic glass from the 
eastern Sierra that they used for knives and projectile points? 
</P>
<P>
 "A good crime scene. That's what we've got here," said Collisson, who lives in 
the east San Gabriel Valley. "Some very small clues, but eventually the whole 
picture will come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-week excavation project, in the Arroyo Seco District, started May 9 
and ends today. There are no answers yet, but four professional archeologists 
who led the dig will study the excavated material, which includes arrowheads, 
grinding stones and charred animal bones, evidence of cooking. In a related 
project, seven volunteers and a paid consultant returned Sunday from a nine-day 
hike into the remote Sheep Mountain Wilderness, where they documented gold 
mining sites from the 1850s and early 1900s for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants will prepare reports on both sites for forest officials, who will 
provide the information to researchers, develop plans to protect the sites and 
possibly develop interpretive displays with the artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Angeles National Forest this year is participating in 
a nationwide U.S. Forest Service program called "Passport in Time," which 
started in 1989 as a way to encourage public involvement and get free labor. 
The program allows rangers to research historic sites for which they have had 
neither the money nor the staff to preserve and document. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest archeologist Michael McIntyre said the program provides a rare 
opportunity to examine sites. With only two archeologists for the 694,000-acre 
forest, there is little time to do much except note the existence of a site 
with historical potential, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forest contains 400 sites that are recorded at UCLA's Archeological 
Information Center, 95% of which are unexplored. Instead, the sites are left to 
the vagaries of weather, looters and animals, said McIntyre, who was hired in 
1981 as the forest's first archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to call any attention to it," McIntyre said. "Leave it alone, 
record it and hope no one notices." 
</P>
<P>
 McIntyre shakes his head at the cost of neglect. Twenty years ago, for 
instance, after Forest Service rangers tried to shore up a river bank, the 
river changed course and washed away Native American rock art in San Gabriel 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Passport in Time projects allow the Forest Service to begin chipping 
away at its backlog of historical and archeological sites. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Native American project, the chance to chase history drew 31 
volunteers -- including residents of Idaho, Arizona and Texas -- to a hilly 
site crowded with Jeffrey Pine, sagebrush and wild rose. Some of the sunburned 
volunteers fell into their sleeping bags as early as 8 p.m., exhausted after a 
long day lugging dirt-filled buckets that turned their arms to stone and 
fighting off swarming gnats that dived into their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers included a certified public accountant who was born in West 
Germany, a yellow pages advertising representative who started the cold 
mornings with extra-strong coffee and a grandmother in a floppy straw hat -- 
people who usually don't get the chance to bite down on an excavated pea-sized 
chip to see if it is hard and clinks against the teeth, a test to help 
determine if it is bone material. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the 21-mile gold mine research hike, past the Bridge to Nowhere and 
through woods with no trails, volunteers lugged 75-pound backpacks up steep 
mountains, keeping their eyes open for black bears, mountain lions and 
rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in the name of history; it certainly can't be for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The unpaid volunteers bring their own food and camping gear. Projects, which 
last from a week to several months, are listed in a nationally distributed 
catalogue that describes the site and any prerequisites for participation, such 
as age and hiking expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 230 projects have been sponsored nationwide. Among them: a Coronado 
National Forest project in Arizona to excavate Old Camp Rucker, a small 
military post that sent out Indian scouts to search for Apaches; and a Nebraska 
National Forest project to record 6,000-year-old prehistoric sites in the Great 
Plains, where researchers have already uncovered a hearth and butchered bison 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, volunteers have made discoveries of their own. For instance, in 
North Dakota, volunteers who searched for Custer's 7th Calvary's trail to the 
Little Bighorn River unexpectedly stumbled across evidence of the army's camp 
sites -- a piece of history that might otherwise have been lost, said Kathleen 
Schamel, Passport in Time coordinator in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have these sites, we don't know what they are and we have to interpret 
them and find out how they fit into the grand scheme of our nation's history," 
Schamel said. 
</P>
<P>
 No federal money is earmarked for the Passport in Time project. Instead, 
officials from each participating national forest use funds from their cultural 
resources budget. For the Native American project, Angeles National Forest 
officials allocated about $23,000 to hire archeology firm C.A. Singer & 
Associates Inc. of Cambria and $15,000 for the mining expedition, led by 
paleontologist Steven W. Conkling of LSA Associates Inc., an Irvine-based 
environmental firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Angeles National Forest, archeological sites are usually discovered as 
part of a cursory investigation for environmental impact reports, which are 
state-required documents for construction projects such as roads and trails. 
During the investigation, McIntyre or his assistant looks for signs of past 
habitation. Dark soil, for instance, often indicates the presence of organic 
materials such as food remains and human waste. The sites stay secret until 
researchers can get to them (burial grounds, however, are left untouched by the 
Forest Service).  
</P>
<P>
 By law, archeological sites recorded at UCLA's local clearinghouse are secret 
-- disclosed only to researchers -- and exempt from the Freedom of Information 
Act. Some, however, are opened up after excavation for interpretive displays. 
In popular hiking areas, sites with archeological potential are closed off but 
unmarked, while sites in remote areas are simply left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service officials learned about the one-acre Native American site 14 
years ago, by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said, 'Oh yeah, as kids we used to come up here and collect 
artifacts,' " McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, a few years ago on the site, McIntyre found a granite grinding stone, 
called a mono , and a flat milling stone, called a metate , both of which 
Native Americans used to grind grain into flour for cakes, gruel and bread. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angeles forest officials did not have the money to do anything but tuck 
the finds away -- until the Passport in Time project came along.  
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the excavation and preservation of the Native American 
site, forest officials last winter made permanent changes: altering the path of 
a trail to avoid the site and moving some camping and equestrian facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest officials picked the site for a Passport in Time project because of the 
potential for rich archeological finds. They also were worried that hikers, 
campers and horses would damage the well-traveled area before they could get to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The dig was slow and painstaking, 10 centimeters of dirt at a time, but one 
that the volunteers cherished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at this as a piece of stone," said 56-year-old Baerbel 
Struthers, fingering bits of excavated material. "I look at it like, 'Who had 
it? And what did they do with it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Struthers, a certified public accountant, drove 90 minutes to the site with 
two friends from Sherman Oaks every morning for a week. The trio wanted the 
chance to record history. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are the one who is capable of showing other people this exists," said her 
friend Geneva Massara, a 63-year-old yellow pages sales representative.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Sheep Mountain Wilderness, volunteers looked for evidence at old 
cabins, mines and mills, which previously had not been explored in depth. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heavily wooded and overgrown area, where volunteers tried unsuccessfully 
to avoid poison oak, the group found remains of miners' cabins made from 
hand-hewn pine, oak and cedar, said Conkling, the group leader. The group also 
found old beer cans, a rusty shell of a 1920s-era Packard with wooden spokes 
about a mile from the mining site and mining equipment, such as a mill that was 
used to grind ore. Conkling will sift through the artifacts and write a report 
on how the miners lived and worked in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 On the hike's first day, volunteer Elizabeth Rothman -- 5 feet, 4 inches and 
132 pounds -- staggered under the weight of a bulging 75-pound backpack that 
included her favorite camping meal: instant mashed potatoes with dried onions 
and Parmesan cheese. Rothman, a 39-year-old sign language interpreter from 
Seattle, couldn't wait to get a glimpse into the lives of miners who worked so 
hard with so little promise of return. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the miners, she knew what she was getting back as an unpaid volunteer, 
hiking into a thick forest and climbing mountains with a 3,000-foot elevation 
gain in less than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 She said simply: 
</P>
<P>
 "It enriches our appreciation of where we live to know what happened there 
before." Volunteering to Dig 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Passport in Time" is a U.S. Forest Service program that recruits 
volunteers for archeological and historic preservation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Catalogues are published twice annually. The current catalogue lists 84 
upcoming projects, none of which are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: There is no charge. Volunteers are unpaid and must provide their own 
transportation, food and, if necessary, camping gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: In national forests around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Duration: Projects range from one week to several months. Participants can 
arrange to show up for only part of a project, but most projects require a 
minimum stay of two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Project examples: In Georgia's Chattahoochee National Forest, volunteers will 
help excavate a rock shelter containing pottery and other artifacts of the 
period from 2000 BC to 1000 AD, as well as a rock shelter used as a Civil War 
draft-dodgers' hide-out; in Idaho's Salmon National Forest, volunteers and 
archeologists will go white-water rafting on the Salmon River, looking for 
evidence of Native Americans and hermits who lived in the rugged canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Requirements: These vary, but most projects require that participants be at 
least 18 years old. Some prefer experience in archeology, carpentry or hiking, 
but several do not require experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Settings: Some sites are in remote areas with no running water; others are 
near motels and bed-and-breakfasts.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; PHOTO CLASS GIVES YOUTHS A POSITIVE IMAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Photographer Ed Goldstein never thought he'd find poetry when he asked a class 
of juvenile offenders to shoot each other -- with Polaroid cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldstein says he discovered the soul of a poet in one of his students, 
who had taken a series of close-up silhouettes of a classmate. The student said 
that in the images he saw "an angel looking down over a man, giving him her 
blessing before she goes back up to heaven, where the door she came through is 
closing slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what I see come out of their imaginations," said Goldstein, a 
professional photographer who taught two-week photography workshops to young 
offenders housed at Camp Miller and Camp Kilpatrick in the Malibu hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, dubbed "Close Up: Face to Face," was offered through the Arts & 
Children Project sponsored by Venice-based L.A. Theatre Works, the Los Angeles 
County Probation Department and the Juvenile Court School Division of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old project has brought hundreds of special arts workshops, 
including painting, dance and theater, into schools at Los Angeles County camps 
and juvenile halls, which house up to 4,600 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The juveniles are in custody for offenses that include murder, rape, robbery 
and theft. Organizers say they believe the workshops may help the youths stay 
out of trouble when they are released. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they look at someone (from) across the street, across the yard, the 
don't really see each other," Goldstein said. "When they're close up, they fool 
around, they're interacting, they're human. This may be an extreme example, but 
before they pull the trigger, they (will) see the other person as human." 
</P>
<P>
 During a class at Camp Miller, a low-security facility housing youths ages 16 
to 18, Goldstein gave a slide show to make them see the world differently 
before they moved on to take portraits of each other and analyze them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shown a slide in which an image of Earth is superimposed over the jaws of a 
wrench, one student said the photographer was making a statement that 
"something man-made is going to destroy the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Another called out his interpretation: "Fix the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Another shot -- a close-up of water droplets on a leaf -- prompted a rash of 
responses: One student saw a saxophone, another the moon and Milky Way and 
still another Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
 After lessons in photography, the students snapped pictures of each other with 
Polaroids. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at a picture he took of a camp mate, student Tylon said he saw former 
world heavyweight boxing champion Evander "Holyfield after he got beat on. 
Volcanoes, as if I were high in the sky. The eyes of a crook tryin' to be 
slick." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, several students said they enjoyed the workshop and prefer the 
camp school -- nestled in a valley in the Santa Monica Mountains -- to their 
neighborhood high schools. (Kilpatrick, next to Miller, is a higher-security 
facility that houses 120 offenders ages 13 to 15). 
</P>
<P>
 "The teachers on the outside are different. They don't care," said Eric, 16, 
of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Lewis, who has taught in the juvenile schools for 17 years, acknowledged 
that some of the offenders will end up back in custody after they are released. 
About 40% to 60% of the juveniles, depending on their age and the facility to 
which they were assigned, commit another offense after their release, according 
to the Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, workshops like the one given by Goldstein help. "What he's 
bringing them is how to look at things differently, that there's more to life 
than a two-block-by-two-block area that they feel safe in." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gloria Newell, principal of the camps: "I felt it's very important to 
integrate the arts into the curriculum, to give them choices. Let's do 
something positive, creative, with their energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gale Cohen, managing director of L.A. Theatre Works, says some offenders go 
into careers in the arts. But more importantly, she says, the workshops give 
the offenders a forum for positive self-expression and help them see past gang 
culture to a broader society. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see the projects completed, you know you've had success," she said. 
"If it wasn't working out, it wouldn't be supported by educators." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in the classroom, students talked about images flashed on the 
wall: enlargements of pollen and dust, a close-up of a housefly's head, a 
tribesman whose face is smeared with paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed (Goldstein) is trying to get you to see things in a different way," Lewis 
tells the students at the end of the class. "And that's what you need to do 
about yourselves too. If you leave this place the same way you came in, nothing 
changes." BRUCE SMITH

COVER STORY; LIGHTS! CAMERA! ACCESS!; FILM TRAINING PROGRAM GIVES TROUBLED 
YOUTH A 2ND CHANCE; JUDY BRANDON

 "Sometimes I get frustrated and sad. Then I see the light at the end of the 
tunnel." * 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Judy Brandon couldn't handle her modeling career and her son. 
So she let go of both. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pittsburgh native, she has worked as a model since age 13. At 23, she moved 
to Los Angeles and fell into a bad crowd. She started drinking and smoking 
marijuana, eventually becoming addicted to cocaine. Still, she kept modeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a functioning alcoholic. I had a pattern, a schedule," said Brandon, 
32, who lives in Culver City. "I would wait until my son went to bed. I would 
do the mother thing, do some (fashion) shooting and then do drugs. It was the 
best-kept secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Her addiction eventually slowed her career and distracted her from her child, 
whom she sent to live with his grandmother. She checked into an Alcoholics 
Anonymous program and when she became sober, she got her son back and enrolled 
in the Amer-I-Can program, where she works part time as a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 There, she met Thompson and jumped at the chance to learn how to become a 
production assistant to support herself. She now works on the "Picket Fences" 
television series. "Judy is an amazing person," said Alice West, senior 
executive producer of "Picket Fences." The production assistant position, West 
said, "is a tough job because it's at the bottom of the pecking order. It's a 
job where people aren't always nice to the P.A. because it's at the bottom. . . 
. But she gets through it all, and it doesn't change her." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon said she wants to "get more involved in what producers do. I want to 
learn editing and then possibly become an associate producer on a television 
series. It's a slow, long process, but its attainable." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon's son John, now 13, is an honors student at Culver Middle School and 
wants to become a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming from where he has been, with an alcoholic mother . . . sometimes I 
want to cry when I see how much better his life has become, through me getting 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, starting at the bottom, in your 30s, can be difficult. "Sometimes I get 
frustrated and sad," she said. "Then I see the light at the end of the tunnel."

 Judy Brandon was controlled by drugs and alcohol. Ellis Ware was in prison for 
robbery and drug possession. Carlos De La Torre was gangbanging. Mortez Bradley 
sold rock cocaine -- for every piece he sold, he'd chip off a sliver for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 All four are now putting in long hours as production assistants on feature 
films, television shows, commercials and music videos. They owe their jobs to 
the Hollywood-based Streetlights Production Assistant Program, which for two 
years has been helping troubled young people turn their lives around by 
training them for jobs on movie and television shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Thompson, a producer of television commercials, founded the program 
after the 1992 riots as a way to combat unemployment and other problems in 
disadvantaged areas of Los Angeles. She has run the program for two years on a 
shoestring budget of about $40,000 by dipping into her savings accounts and 
using credit cards, and through small donations from colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that, in the past, she had assumed that "someone" would do something 
to relieve the problems that ignited the riot. "Then it struck me, most of us 
feel that way," Thompson said. "I would look around the commercial sets, and 
there were no Hispanics or blacks working as production assistants. I knew it 
was because they didn't have an open door. And I thought, 'Maybe I can be the 
open door.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, Brandon, De La Torre and Ware, all in their 20s or early 30s, are 
among the 27 people that the program has trained for careers in a business 
notorious for being hard to break into. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has recruited most of the trainees through social service 
organizations such as the Amer-I-Can jobs program, run by former football star 
Jim Brown, and Father Gregory Boyle's Jobs for a Future program in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 They work in entry-level jobs as production assistants, moving from set to set 
as employment becomes available. The jobs are not glamorous. They get coffee 
for producers, send faxes, photocopy scripts and sweep up, among other chores. 
The trainees all work on non-union productions, receiving an average of $150 
per day. One Streetlights alumnus works as a second assistant director, making 
about $300 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Every success story, Thompson says, justifies her struggle.

 "I've seen the other side, and this side looks a lot better to me." * 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, Mortez Bradley predicts, a movie will be made about his life -- and 
he plans to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 And it will be a great story, he says, the tale of a former Venice drug dealer 
who forms his own production company and makes it big in the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For now Bradley, 26, is content with working as a second assistant director on 
commercials and movie videos. It's a big step from his drug-dealing days. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Los Angeles from St. Louis in 1986, he lived with his aunt and 
worked as a cook in posh Los Angeles restaurants. Things were going pretty well 
until a relative introduced him to rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, "all hell broke loose." 
</P>
<P>
 He got strung out on cocaine, he said, and quit his jobs. He tried living with 
his father in the Valley, but things didn't work out and Bradley moved out. He 
wound up homeless in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before he was panhandling and selling rock cocaine on the 
streets. He feared for his life after a run-in with a supplier known as 
Bulldog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting there in Venice, sampling the profit and the investment, 
thinking, 'Now what am I gonna do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley hustled up enough money to get a room Downtown and checked into 
Brown's Amer-I-Can program, which he had heard about from a friend. He quit 
cocaine cold-turkey. "It's been seven years since I did cocaine. I never went 
back to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's program directed him to Streetlights in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The production assistant job, he said, is one "nobody wants to do. But I 
showed them I would do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he got married and had a son. Success, he said, soon became a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be an inspiration for my son -- a role model," said Bradley, who 
now lives in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly rose through the production ranks, eventually becoming a second 
assistant director on music videos and commercials. He makes sure the 
performers have their makeup done and wardrobe in place, rounds them up for the 
shoot and proofreads contracts, among other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 And he harbors the dream of becoming an executive producer and running his own 
company. He wants to increase the number of African Americans in the business 
and help others like himself with a troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
 His old hustling friends, he said, "need to see something different. If you 
could take some of them out of the drug scene, that could change some things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there, I've seen the other side, and this side looks a lot better 
to me."

YOUTH A 2ND CHANCE; CARLOS DE LA TORRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I never did anything like this before. I get to meet new people. It's cool." 
* 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the eighth grade when I started getting into gangs," said Carlos De 
La Torre, 20, known as "Critter" in his Highland Park neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 He got into the gang for the excitement, he said, and "homie love," the 
camaraderie among members of his gang. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he met Father Boyle two years ago and, through his Jobs for a Future 
program, he started working at its Homeboy Tortillas eatery in Downtown Los 
Angeles, later becoming a manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father Boyle was always around, and he asked me if I wanted to do something 
with my life, and I said, yeah," De La Torre recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, he attended a Jobs for a Future board meeting, where he met Mary 
Kay Powell, president of RASTAR productions in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked Dorothy to take a chance on Carlos," Powell said. "Few employers take 
a chance on guys like Carlos." 
</P>
<P>
 After De La Torre got laid off from Homeboy last summer, he started the 
production assistant training and was hired by Hollywood Pictures in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never did anything like this before," De La Torre said. "I get to meet new 
people. It's cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff at Hollywood Pictures was wary of De La Torre at first, given his 
background. But he quickly proved himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did everything with total enthusiasm, which is rare in this business," 
said Karen Shaw, a production coordinator at Hollywood Pictures. "Everything I 
gave him to do, he finished in seconds and was back for more work." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a production assistant on the Disney feature, "My Posse Don't Do 
Homework," De La Torre still lives in the same neighborhood, but he said his 
work schedule keeps him out of the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in the gang, but I'm not active. I'm on the reserve list," he said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 His children, a 3-year-old girl and a newborn boy, and his job are the focus 
in his life now. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends in the neighborhood are impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Gimme a job.' And I say, 'Let me get big first. Let me become a 
studio head. Then I'll get you a job.' "

YOUTH A 2ND CHANCE; ELLIS WARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I always thought the only way to make this kind of money would be by 
hustling." * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very sharp people in jail," said Ellis Ware, 33, picking 
through the memories of his years in prison. "You'd be amazed how intelligent 
these guys are, and they could do anything, given the right motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 Years passed before Ware realized he had the right motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ware's influences early in life were the gangs and drug deals and violence of 
his neighborhood, the Oakwood section of Venice. From age 15, when he first 
joined a gang, until he was 29, Ware was in and out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to rob, shoot people, get shot, sell drugs, do whatever we had to do 
to make money," Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wound up serving a two-year sentence in Tehachapi State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was released from prison four years ago, he met his future wife, who 
soon became pregnant. That is when he decided to change his lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'How am I gonna be there for my kids if I'm in jail?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Without a high school diploma, Ware had difficulty finding work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any skills, except what I learned in prison, which was working 
on a sewing machine," said Ware, who now lives in Studio City with his wife, 
his 2-year-old son and two daughters, ages 4 and 1. "I didn't see that as a way 
to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 He heard about the Amer-I-Can program from friends. In 1992, he met Thompson, 
who drilled him and other trainees on such good work habits as arriving on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Since starting with Streetlights in 1992, Ware has worked primarily on 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn the business from the inside out," he said. "Maybe in 10 
years, I can produce commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm paying my dues," said Ware, who works long hours. "I work, come home and 
sleep a little, and then go out and work again." But that's fine, he said, 
because the money is so good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought the only way to make this kind of money would be by 
hustling." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he often takes his 2-year-old son to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "After having kids, I saw how backwards it was to rob people of what they 
have," he said. "Getting knowledge is worth more money than I ever thought I 
would make."

COVER STORY; FOUNDER STRUGGLES TO KEEP MOVIE PROGRAM ROLLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those with connections, declares Dorothy Thompson, get the jobs. Organizations 
with connections get grants. 
</P>
<P>
 And while she has become a connection for the trainees who have gone on to 
establish careers as production assistants, she worries that she can't get the 
funding needed for the survival of Streetlights, the program she started two 
years ago that trains troubled young people for entry-level jobs in the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Since starting the program, Thompson, 43, sent three grant proposals to RLA, 
formerly Rebuild L.A. She said she hasn't heard from them. (RLA, said 
spokeswoman Val Bunting, tries to respond to each proposal. But she also noted 
that thousands of applications were received after the riots, more than the 
agency could handle.) 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson also has called state legislators, who say they're interested in 
helping. "But I end up talking to their staffers, and they keep putting me 
off," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, she keeps Streetlights afloat with her own will, help from a few 
benefactors and her good credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does all the work," said Mary Kay Powell, president of RASTAR 
Productions. "She trains them, follows through, places them. She is a one-woman 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson left a job in advertising 12 years ago to start a career in the 
production of commercials. At 34, she began as a production assistant and 
ultimately became a producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she spends most of her time running Streetlights, which has an annual 
budget of about $20,000 a year. "I take a job producing commercials when I'm 
desperate," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Working with five students at a time, Thompson tells her trainees what is 
expected of production assistants. Classes are held in an office donated by 
Hollywood Center Studios. The students spend 12 hours on a set. They watch and 
later assist on a job without pay. After a trainee is hired, she keeps in touch 
with the employer to monitor the student's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Streetlights has a four-month waiting list. Thompson wants to expand and help 
more people get jobs in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thompson said she gets frustrated by lip service, be it from legislators 
or from the industry. There's also the wariness some employers have about 
hiring someone with a troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
 A few failed. One trainee, she says, "just went back on crack. It broke my 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But the successes outnumber the failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson and Streetlights, said Mortez Bradley, changed his life. "I feel 
there are so many people like Eddie Murphy and Oprah Winfrey who have made it 
and who should be doing something like what Dorothy is doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Thompson sometimes thinks Streetlights will die if she doesn't find 
enough money to sustain the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I think, no, I won't give up." Streetlights, she said, has made a 
difference for many young men and women whose futures looked dim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting off welfare, they're working." she said.

EDUCATION / MARY LAINE YARBER: PHONICS IS A BUILDING BLOCK OF READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A good command of phonics is crucial for early forays into the world of 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Phonics allows children to sound out unfamiliar words (and when you're just 
starting out, most words are unfamiliar) by giving them rules about how each 
letter sounds.  
</P>
<P>
 As is true of most teaching methods, the teaching of phonics swings in and out 
of favor with educators and learning theorists every few decades. It was most 
popular in the first half of this century, later lost momentum and is now 
growing popular again. 
</P>
<P>
 But phonics has never completely disappeared from school reading programs 
because it's such a good shortcut to learning pronunciation. Even so, many 
parents are mystified by the concept of phonics -- the term itself sounds 
frighteningly clinical. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, learning enough about phonics so that you can practice the sounds with 
your child at home is fairly easy. Here's a crash course in the basic concepts 
and terminology of phonics. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise of phonics is that each letter of the alphabet represents a sound 
(or sometimes two). Thus, if your child learns the roughly 40 sounds made by 
our alphabet's 26 letters, then he or she should be able to correctly sound out 
most unfamiliar words found in daily reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, phonics involves several categories of sounds. These are sounds 
you speak, hear and read every day, so you can practice them with your child at 
home, no matter what your own level of education or income. 
</P>
<P>
 Some storybooks borrowed from the public library should suffice. Your child's 
teacher may also be able to lend you practice materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The study of phonics often begins with the learning of consonants because 
they're the basic building blocks of words and their sounds are consistent. 
Thus the first step in learning phonics is knowing what sound each consonant 
makes by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Consonant blends occur when two or more letters are pronounced together. They 
include br in brush, gl in glue, spr in spruce, squ in squeeze and tr in train. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't make a word just with consonants; knowing the sounds of vowels 
is a part of phonics too. 
</P>
<P>
 Each vowel has both a short sound and a long sound. Short sounds include the a 
in ant, e in end, i in spit, o in otter and u in mud. Long vowel sounds include 
the a in Quaker, e in tepee, i in while, o in rose and u in tuba.  
</P>
<P>
 Phonics teaches kids a series of rules for knowing when a vowel makes a long 
or short sound, and when y is a vowel, such as: "If a vowel appears between two 
consonants in a word, it's probably a short vowel." 
</P>
<P>
 Diphthongs occur when two different vowels appear together and each 
contributes to an overall sound. We've got only four of them in English -- oi , 
ou , ow and oy -- so it's easy to help your child spot them. They're heard in 
moist, pout, frown and soy. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagraphs are slightly different from diphthongs. They're composed of two 
different letters that appear next to each other and make one new sound 
together. Here are some examples for starters: au , aw , oo , ee , p h, sh , th 
, nk , ck and ng . 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on phonics, ask your child's teacher. Since every school 
teaches phonics a little differently, it's best to find out the concepts and 
rules your child is learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Resources for practicing phonics with your child at home are also easy to 
find. Inexpensive workbooks are sold by many children's book or toy stores; 
they also often sell software for phonics practice on home computers. "Sesame 
Street" offers clever phonics practice because each alphabet letter gets a 
whole episode and educational theme song to itself.  
</P>
<P>
 And, although I'm generally reluctant to suggest specific brands or products, 
my advice would be incomplete without mentioning the famous "Hooked on Phonics" 
program. Ignore all the ribbing it takes in late-night comedians' monologues -- 
the multimedia program really can help your child's study of phonics and basic 
reading skills.

LITTLE LEAGUER BALKS AT NEW TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN GRIFFITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christian Tavarez and his mother thought Little League was about friendship 
and fun as well as hitting and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 A coach on one of the organization's major league teams chose the 11-year-old 
Pomona boy shortly after the playing season began in April. But Christian said 
that he craved the security of staying with his "cool" teammates on the minor 
league Dodgers through the season's end on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal contact was especially important to Christian because of his 
father's death. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Maria, and older sister Yvonne say the boy became anxious and had 
trouble sleeping after he was drafted. He told them that losing his team, with 
which he had been practicing and playing for three months, reminded him of 
losing his father, who was slain a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Little League rules, once a minor leaguer is chosen by the 
majors, the player has to go or be transferred to another minor team, and 
Christian's appeal failed to sway the board of the Ted Greene League. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying on a minor team stunts a player's progress, said league President 
Dennis O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would you want a kid to repeat the 5th grade just because he's having 
fun?" O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his three years in the post, O'Neill said, he has heard every excuse 
from parents and players who want to stay on their old team. Often, it turns 
out that they are on a first-place minor team and do not want to give up their 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christian decided he would quit softball rather than face a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't fair," he said before a recent game. "A kid has to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 But a week later, a family friend appealed above the league board to district 
administrator Steve Felman. A letter from a psychologist -- saying the move 
would harm Christian's recovery from the trauma of his father's death -- helped 
persuade Felman to bring Christian back in his No. 11 Dodgers jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a strong hitter, first baseman and shortstop, according to his coach, 
Dennis Beltran, and next year Christian hopes to join a major league team. 
</P>
<P>
 Being on a major team is the goal of Little League programs, according to the 
Minor League rule book and Felman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major league is what you live and die for," Felman said.

OUT AND ABOUT / REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE: TEATIME WEST OF THE THAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY The Regent Beverly Wilshire, 9500 Wilshire Blvd., 
Beverly Hills. Tea is served daily from 3 to 5 p.m. in the lobby lounge. 
Reservations are required for six or more. Cost is $16.50 per person. 
Information: (310) 275-5200.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in the '90s can be stressful and hectic, but here is one way to get 
relief: a spot of tea in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The British have their afternoon tea to relax and chat, and you can, too, at 
the elegant Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 High tea served in the hotel lobby lounge is serious business. Lounge maitre 
d'hotel Mohammed Wali and the meticulous staff pride themselves on serving one 
of the most authentic tea services this side of the River Thames. 
</P>
<P>
 Sip a cup of tea or nibble on a finger sandwich and you'll see why it has 
become a Westside tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen varieties of tea are offered. In addition to traditional 
favorites such as Earl Grey and Darjeeling, you'll also find exhilarating 
Passion Fruit, China Rose and Jasmine Blossom teas. Each tea is brewed in a 
tiny, white teapot and poured through a strainer into a simple, china teacup. 
</P>
<P>
 Finger sandwiches with no crust are served from a silver platter. Patrons can 
choose from smoked salmon, cucumber and tomato, egg salad or cheese sandwiches. 
Scones, which are thicker and denser than biscuits, are also served with 
whipped cream, marmalade, or strawberry or raspberry jam. 
</P>
<P>
 After tea and sandwiches, try the pastries -- cake, fruit tarts, cream puffs 
or chocolate eclairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't find many places that serve tea this way," said Beverly Hills 
resident and regular customer Bryan Peele. "It's a great place (to go) when you 
don't want to put up with the hustle and bustle (of life)." 
</P>
<P>
 The tearoom is open and airy. A large bouquet of fresh flowers is the 
centerpiece of this richly decorated room, which is surrounded by deep, 
comfortable chairs and tables draped with crisp, white linen tablecloths. Each 
afternoon, a pianist plays classical works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to come here and listen to the piano," said Martin Van Schaak, who 
stops by regularly when he's in town on business. "It has a European 
atmosphere. I feel like I am sitting in London or Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of having tea was instituted in the 18th Century by Anna, 
seventh duchess of Bedford. It was intended to be a social gathering for 
aristocrats and the affluent, but its popularity made its way to the masses. By 
the time Queen Victoria ascended to the throne in the 19th Century, afternoon 
tea was a national pastime in Britain and remains so today. It has also made 
life a little more tolerable for some Americans. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY The Regent

TAXES: PROPOSAL SUPPORTING SCHOOLS LINKED TO PROPERTY VALUES, READER BELIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I own a two-bedroom house in Santa Monica's Sunset Park. We pay 
$4,000 a year in property tax.When we recently refinanced, we found our 
property had lost $40,000 in value. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel tax proposal put on the ballot by the school board is one tiny part 
of our tax payments, but it will help keep Santa Monica-Malibu public schools 
solvent if it passes, so I support it strongly. Our home is our largest 
investment. And anything that hurts our schools will further hurt our property 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a 60-year-old, church-going, U.S.-born Army veteran who has grown 
children. I am not a renter. I don't belong to Santa Monica Renters Rights, a 
group which a May 15 letter writer contends controls the local school board. 
</P>
<P>
 That letter writer doesn't like the sex-education program in the schools and 
he doesn't like SMRR, and that's fine by me. But that is hardly a reason to 
cripple school financing by voting out a critical revenue source for the 
schools. Vote to change the school board if you wish, but support the Santa 
Monica-Malibu schools' parcel tax. Don't make homeowners' property values a 
victim of political battles.

ELECTION: BETTER INFORMATION ON CIVIC CENTER PLAN IS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's more than a little disingenuous for Eric Siss (Letters, May 15) to 
complain about how much Santa Monica must spend for the Civic Center election 
when we are having the election because opponents of the plan, including Mr. 
Siss, 1) refused to accept the results of a long public process that led to a 
rare, unanimous vote from the usually fractious City Council (including, of 
course, those members who are most skeptical of development), and 2) obtained 
enough signatures to put the plan on the ballot with a campaign of falsehoods 
about the plan that continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the opponents of the plan do not want the voters to have the 
opportunity to read the plan.Their whole strategy, as evidenced by the 
techniques they used in gathering signatures, is to reduce a sophisticated plan 
that involved compromises by all parties to a few negative and false slogans. 
Now that we are having an election, the opponents don't want the electorate to 
be informed. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that the plan converts an urban dead zone into a suitable, 
moderately developed mixed-used neighborhood. Traffic and other environmental 
impacts will be mitigated. Asphalt will be converted to grass. Family-friendly 
housing will replace boarded-up buildings. Read the plan and then vote YES on D 
and E.

<P>
 Two years after winning the College World Series, and for the first time since 
1990, Pepperdine's baseball season ended before the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves (33-20) finished second in the West Coast Conference but did not 
receive one of the 24 at-large berths for the 48-team NCAA Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine's chances were diminished because of the inordinate number of 
upsets in conference tournaments. Winners of conference tournaments are given 
automatic berths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is tough to accept the fact that we didn't get a bid after playing well 
the final two months of the season, facing the number of ranked nonconference 
opponents and finishing only one game behind Santa Clara in the final league 
standings," Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez said. "I believe we're one of the top 
48 teams in the nation. There were a few upsets in some of the conference 
tournaments, and that may have cost a team like us a spot in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite missing the tournament for the first time in four seasons, the Waves 
surpassed the 30-win mark for the 17th consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves also had four players selected to the all-WCC first team: sophomore 
outfielder Ryan Christenson, sophomore third baseman Ruben Gamboa, sophomore 
pitcher Cade Gaspar and senior pitcher Josh Schultz. DOWN, BUT NOT OUT 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester's baseball team was upset by Palisades, 4-3, Monday and finished 
second to University in the Western League. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Tony Viramontes drove in the winning run with a two-out single 
as Palisades scored three runs in the top of the seventh. It was the third 
consecutive loss for the Comets (17-12), who began the season 1-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new four-game season starts Friday," Westchester Coach Ron Kasparian said. 
"We're not flat -- we just had a streak of bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team goes through periods like this. Hopefully, it doesn't come at the 
end of the season, but it did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets, 13-4 in the Western League, will need the bottom of their lineup 
to start hitting to make it to the City Section 4-A Division finals, which are 
scheduled June 6 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets made their last championship appearance in 1984 when Ted Holcomb, 
San Francisco 49ers linebacker Ken Norton Jr. and Comet junior varsity coach 
DeWitt Cotton were on the team. Westchester lost in the '84 final to Venice, 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester won its only championship, a 3-A title, in 1983. IT WAS A GOOD 
FRIDAY 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Coach Pete McKellar and Crossroads Coach Bill Keep were 
successful in their playoff debuts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 McKellar guided the Vikings to a 3-1 victory over Long Beach Millikan in a 
Southern Section Division I opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's Gary Ovsiowitz hit a two-run double in the third inning and 
pitcher Sergio Gonzalez threw a three-hitter with six strikeouts for the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley beat Santa Monica, 7-0, Tuesday in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't nervous," McKellar said about his playoff debut. "I told the kids we 
needed to play some sound defense and come up with the big hits. Millikan is a 
traditional power and a tough team to beat in the playoffs. My main goal was to 
get the Vikings past the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica (14-11) finished second in the Bay League. The team faltered in 
the first round the previous two seasons when McKellar was an assistant under 
Jose Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley has always been good," McKellar said of the second-round game. 
"They have had some internal problems with their coach, but that hasn't hurt 
them as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads (15-11) got a strong pitching performance from Juan Guzman to shut 
out Village Christian, 10-0, Friday in the Division V playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played one of the best games of the season against Brentwood," Keep said 
about the 3-1 win over the Eagles on May 13. "The only question was whether we 
were going to let down in the playoffs or come ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Keep had his doubts after Crossroads made fielding errors in the first two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian had runners on second and third base with one out in the 
first and second innings, but Guzman (6-2) was able to pitch out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Guzman) has been a success on the mound when we needed the big-game win," 
Keep said. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano beat the Roadrunners, 9-6, Tuesday in the second round. POSTSEASON 
NOTES 
</P>
<P>

IT'S UGLY AS ANGELS LOSE, 9-7; BASEBALL: TIGERS GET OFF TO 7-0 LEAD, THEN HANG 
ON -- IN THE KIND OF GAME THAT LACHEMANN DISLIKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcel Lachemann steals glances at the Florida Marlins' scores during Angel 
games. He talks with his brother, Rene, their manager, several times a day, 
sometimes until 3 a.m. He studies their box scores. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be Marcel Lachemann's dream job, managing the Angels, but watching 
the Marlins flounder since his departure as their pitching coach -- losing five 
of seven games -- is painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what the Marlins are going through," Angel reliever Joe Grahe said 
after the Angels' 9-7 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday, "because we went 
through the same thing when Lach left us in '92. You hate to use it as a 
crutch, but the man definitely helps your psyche." 
</P>
<P>
 While Lachemann would love to remedy the Marlins' woes, the Angels coldly 
reminded him that there are problems on the home front, losing to Tigers in 
front of 13,305 at Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, who cherishes a fine pitching duel, watched the teams combine for 
21 hits -- nine for extra bases -- off nine pitchers. It was ugly, with only 
the Angels' five-run eighth inning keeping the score respectable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some things that we need to fix, obviously," Lachemann said. "You 
just can't pitch behind and let bases on balls beat you. As intimidating a park 
as this is, you have to make them swing the bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, showing his intolerance for walks, yanked starter John Farrell 
after only 1 1/3 innings. Farrell gave up two hits, but after his fifth walk, 
Lachemann had seen enough and replaced him with Mark Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking I almost had to pitch perfect," said Farrell (1-1), who 
yielded four earned runs. "Pitching with the stadium on your mind is not the 
way to go about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell might be forced to have a strong performance in his next outing simply 
to avoid being removed from the rotation. Brian Anderson is scheduled to return 
from the disabled list in two weeks, and someone will have to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worrying about that," Farrell said. "All you can do is do your best, 
and hopefully your performance will influence those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 It figures to be Lachemann's first major personnel decision, but as he was 
forewarned by friends and family, there will be plenty of nights like these. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope I don't take them any harder than I did before," said Lachemann, 
who is 4-2 on the job, "because I didn't take them very good as a pitching 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, who took each defeat personally as a pitching coach, certainly had 
difficulty accepting this loss. The Angels at least made it close after getting 
only one hit in the first six innings against Tiger starter John Doherty and 
falling behind, 7-0. But it was little consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcel loves good pitching," Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson said. "So I'm sure 
this wasn't his cup of tea. Gene Mauch used to tell me Marcel Lachemann is the 
best pitching coach he's ever seen, which is quite a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I guarantee you one thing, the guy will never get carried away. He comes 
from a great family. He will not change. Marcel will always be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who has known Lachemann since they were kids, sat down with him 
Wednesday and discussed the nuances of managing. He offered advice, told him to 
call whenever he wants, and most important, reminded him to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't stop them from worrying, stop them from the pratfalls," Anderson 
said. "If you don't worry about getting fired, you'll never have the fear of 
being manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done a lot of things wrong in 25 years, but I've never been afraid of 
any general manager or owner. I don't align myself with the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be here because I'm their buddy. If they don't want me here, 
give me a call. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I told Marcel. 'Do your best. If that isn't good enough, it's no 
big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, of course, has one distinct advantage over Anderson and all but 
three of his peers in the game. He is managing in the American League West, 
where the Angels' 21-26 record is good enough for first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, meanwhile, are last in the American League East at 20-22. In the 
West, that record would give them a 1 1/2-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's (lousy) for anyone to complain," Anderson said. "That's a cheap out, is 
all that it is. These are the rules. We knew what the divisions were going to 
be before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever wins that division deserves to be in the playoffs just as much as 
anyone else does. The (AL West champion) could win it all. Nobody's going to 
want to play that team in a short series."

DODGERS WIN IT IN NINTH; BASEBALL: KARROS' SACRIFICE FLY BEATS CUBS, 7-6, AFTER 
WORRELL GIVES UP TYING RUN IN TOP OF THE INNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a day Dodger management finally severed its relationship with Darryl 
Strawberry, the players responded as they said they would. Neither surprised 
that Strawberry had been released, nor affected professionally by the news, the 
Dodgers went out Wednesday and beat the Chicago Cubs, 7-6, in the style they 
have used all season -- with another ninth-inning adventure. "I kind of see us 
horsepower-wise like a V-8 engine running on seven cylinders; we need to get 
that eighth one going," said Todd Worrell (3-2) after the Dodgers stopped the 
Cubs' winning streak at eight games before 54,374 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, though, have gotten used to one-run games, having played 24 of 
them and won 13. They won in the bottom of the ninth, when, with the bases 
loaded and none out, pinch-hitter Eric Karros, having been rested for the game, 
drove in Jose Offerman with a fly ball to center against reliever Dan Plesac 
(1-2).  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever want a day off at my age; I should be able to go out and play 
every day," said Karros, hitless in his last 13 at-bats before Wednesday, when 
Manager Tom Lasorda benched Karros and Tim Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman had led off the inning with a single and went to second when Ryne 
Sandberg made a bad throw to first. Manager Tom Lasorda originally sent up 
Karros, but called him back in favor of Mitch Webster, thinking that with 
left-hander Plesac pitching, the Cubs would walk a right-handed batter to get 
to left-handed hitter Brett Butler. The move paid off, with Webster's single to 
left moving Offerman to third.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler, an excellent bunter, was up, but Lasorda said he didn't give thought 
to a suicide squeeze. "He missed two already this season," Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler walked to load the bases before Karros, batting for Jeff Treadway, hit 
the sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had a 6-2 lead before the seventh inning, and a 6-5 lead before 
the ninth, when Glenallen Hill scored the Cubs' tying run after Kevin 
Roberson's double to right center against Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawon Dunston's three-run homer off Tom Candiotti in the seventh inning 
brought the Cubs within a run and sent Candiotti him to the showers. Gott held 
the Cubs scoreless through the eighth and left after walking Steve Buechele to 
lead off the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Osuna struck out Rick Wilkins before Worrell gave up Roberson's double. But 
the Dodgers said they kept believing they could win, an attitude that helped 
them win 11 of 13 games before this home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had it (the feeling) the last home stand, we had it on the road, it's 
probably the way the Cubs thought tonight when they were coming back in the 
ninth," said Candiotti, who gave up five runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers snapped out of their malaise, scoring at least twice the number of 
runs they had in the previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' sixth run of the game, though, caused concern in the Dodger 
dugout. Delino Deshields suffered a cut middle finger on his left hand when 
scoring on Jim Bullinger's wild pitch in the fifth inning. Although the injury 
appears to be minor, he left the game and received three stitches. He will have 
X-rays today.

 Patience, Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Caray, the Chicago Cubs' irreverent, irascible and impatient announcer, 
did a slow burn Monday night, when Cub starter Jose Guzman faltered early 
against the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, get someone warmed up! This guy's got nothin'!" Caray said, early in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was before Guzman gave up a three-run homer to the opposing pitcher, 
Kevin Gross. Caray was furious.  
</P>
<P>
 As Gross circled the bases, Caray bellowed: "Just because we pay these 
pitchers these big salaries, does that mean we have to keep usin' 'em? This 
guy's awful!" 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman settled down after that, and so did Caray. Guzman didn't give up 
another hit until the fifth, and the Cubs won, 6-3.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; MESSIER'S THREE GOALS KEEP RANGERS ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Messier guaranteed a victory in Game 6 and delivered in what might go 
down as one of the most clutch performances in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier scored three third-period goals, including the game-winner with 7:48 
to play Wednesday night, and the Rangers stayed alive by rallying from a 
two-goal deficit to beat the New Jersey Devils, 4-2, forcing a seventh and 
deciding game in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we are going to go in there and win Game 6 and bring it back to the 
Garden," Messier had said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The series returns to Madison Square Garden on Friday, where the Devils have 
already won two of the three games. The winner will open the Stanley Cup final 
series next Tuesday against Western Conference champion Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "He leads and they follow," Devil center Bernie Nicholls said. "Your best 
players can't say that we have to win tonight's game; he's got to guarantee it. 
He went out and proved he was going to do it and they followed. That's why in 
my opinion he is the best money player in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best clutch player. I know Gretz (Wayne Gretzky) and Mario (Lemieux) 
get a lot of credit, but when the chips are down and there is a big game to be 
won, there is nobody better." 
</P>
<P>
 Messier, veteran of five Stanley Cup champions with Edmonton, refused to 
characterize the game as one of his best and pointed to goalie Mike Richter as 
the one who kept New York around after it fell behind, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one man wins the hockey game, or any championship, or anything in a team 
sport," Messier said. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the prediction, Messier said all he was trying to do after Game 5 
was restore the team's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think about the repercussions until later in the night," he said. 
"It wasn't about being cocky or arrogant. It was one of those thing you have to 
get the team to believe in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 For 38 minutes, it appeared that Game 7 would not be necessary as the Devils 
opened a 2-0 lead on goals by Scott Niedermayer and Claude Lemieux and 
dominated play with Martin Brodeur stopping several good chances by New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The time seemed ripe for another chapter of Stanley Cup frustration for the 
Rangers, but Messier and Alexei Kovalev refused to let New York die. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Keenan seemed to be at a loss for words to describe what Messier 
had done in keeping alive the Rangers quest for a first Stanley Cup since 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took it in his own hands and showed the resolve he talked about before the 
game," Keenan said. "I don't have to say much. His actions spoke as many words 
as I could think of. That has to rank up there with the best I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Kovalev got the Rangers going late in the second period with a goal and 
Messier tied it early in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brodeur stopped several good scoring chances, Messier came through with 
the teams skating four on four. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Leetch sent Kovalev into the Devils' zone with a cross-ice pass, and the 
Russian fired a shot that bounced off Brodeur and down to the ice, where 
Messier banged it into the net with Nicholls draped all over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier added an empty-net goal with 1:45 to play with New Jersey on a power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers finished with 36 shots on goal, including a 14-4 advantage in the 
third period, and Richter made 28 saves.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl isn't the first strawberry to spoil quickly, just the most expensive. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers got one half of a good season out of Darryl Strawberry, the second 
half of 1991. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Then he became the biggest dud in Los Angeles pro sports history. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The back injury he suffered in 1992 wasn't his fault, but most of the problems 
that followed were. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I applauded the Dodgers for signing him on what they thought was his way to 
the Hall of Fame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I applaud them for releasing him and admitting he'll never get there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I wish him good luck, but a comeback is going to take a lot more determination 
than he has shown his hometown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our guest expert on the great home run explosion is Steve Stone. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt about the balls being souped up," said Stone, who is Harry 
Caray's sidekick on Chicago Cub telecasts and won the 1980 American League Cy 
Young Award. "They're a little harder, maybe wound up tighter." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Stone says there are other factors in the nightly parade of 12-6 and 10-8 
games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike zone is smaller," he said. "Anything above the waist is being 
called a ball. It used to be above the letters. Left-handed batters hit low 
pitches like crazy against right-handed pitchers, for some reason. Everyone has 
to pitch lower now and you see the results." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, who was 25-7 for Baltimore in his Cy Young year, says all the rule 
changes in the last three decades have been in favor of batters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to see high-scoring games," he said. "So, in 1969, the year after 
Bob Gibson had a 1.12 ERA, they lowered the mound from 18 to 10 inches. That 
took away the effectiveness of the over-handed fastball, curveball pitchers. 
Now you see the sinker, the slider and the split finger. A hard thrower used to 
be timed at 92, 93 m.p.h. Now, it's 88 or 89." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How much is expansion responsible for the rise in gopher balls? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only 20 spots added last year when home runs also were up by a 
good percentage," Stone said. "That means that an awful lot of pitchers who 
were here before expansion are giving up home runs too." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Stone is happy that he pitched when the game was safer and saner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous out there for pitchers the way balls are coming off bats," he 
said. "I see pitchers being hit on the feet on a daily basis. The mound is a 
tough place to be today." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This new playoff format has got me wondering how baseball teams are going to 
celebrate winning various titles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there will be a soda celebration in the clubhouse for a division 
title, beer for the first round of the playoffs, wine for a league title, and, 
of course, champagne for the World Series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Padres do not figure to be contending for any title, but their 
star, Tony Gwynn, says he likes the new three-division setup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are complaining about it now, but wait until later when there are 
races for playoff spots," he said. "It's going to be exciting." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 New Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann pitched for Rod Dedeaux at USC and was also 
his assistant coach for four years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What you did at Bovard Field will work for you at Anaheim Stadium, too," 
Dedeaux faxed Lachemann the day he replaced Buck Rodgers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Another prominent Southland sports personality who pitched for Dedeaux at USC 
is Cliff Goodrich, president of Santa Anita. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Cliff was a big, gangly right-hander who might have gone on to pitch in the 
majors if he hadn't gotten hurt," Dedeaux said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Oscar De La Hoya defeats Giorgio Campanella as expected Friday at the MGM 
Grand in Las Vegas, he will face Jorge Paez July 29 at the same site. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Roy Jones Jr. probably 
has the toughest opponent of the four young stars being showcased Friday -- 
Thomas Tate, brother of former 160-pound champion Frank Tate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If John Starks, who is better known for his offense, can keep holding Reggie 
Miller to 14 points, it will be be difficult for the Indiana Pacers to beat the 
New York Knicks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I can't get enough of overtime in the NHL playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Utah should give the Jazz nickname back to New Orleans.

TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN; AGASSI BATTLES BACK THIS TIME, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PASS 
MUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Agassi was drained and defeated, but as he walked off Court A at Roland 
Garros Stadium in the twilight Wednesday, he knew his game was not destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 During an emotionally charged second-round match, Agassi discovered that he 
has, if nothing else, resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing against No. 11-ranked Thomas Muster, Agassi rallied and rallied and 
rallied, before losing a 3-hour 43-minute match, 6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 7-5, 2-6, 7-5, 
at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In the day's most entertaining performance, Agassi proved he is still capable 
of big victories, if not now, then in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi has acknowledged that in the past he had difficulty after falling 
behind in a match, as he did against Muster. And although he had every chance 
to self-destruct, Agassi showed moxie even when trailing 5-1 in the fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Agassi walked to the center of the new court, bowed and blew kisses 
to cheering fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Muster, a hard-hitting left hander and one of the world's best on clay, 
was too strong for Agassi. Suffering from blisters on both feet, Muster ignored 
the pro-Agassi crowd and continued battling whenever Agassi gained the upper 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 5-1, he just risked everything because he had the match lost already," 
Muster said. "He was putting me under pressure and he had the crowd on his 
side. I had to play against everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not Muster who seemed to crack. Agassi's terrific play was almost 
obscured by his conduct -- he was warned once for obscenity in the fourth set 
and received a penalty point in the fifth set for a second offense. A third 
violation would have resulted in a default. 
</P>
<P>
 He began yelling obscenities at himself for unforced errors that led to a 
first-set loss and a 5-2 deficit in the second. In the sixth game of the fourth 
set, he erupted when Bruno Rebeuch, a veteran chair umpire, overruled a line 
call that would have given Muster a double fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the third game of the fifth set, Agassi criticized Rebeuch for 
slapping him with a penalty point when Agassi shouted a pejorative for 
homosexuals in chastising himself for an error. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say anything worthy of a point penalty," Agassi said. "It's 
something I've said frequently and said earlier in the match. I was under the 
impression it was OK. It's sad the guy in the chair could do that. Had I known, 
I certainly wouldn't have said it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing Wednesday were top-seeded Pete Sampras and two-time champion 
Jim Courier. Sampras struggled against No. 283 Marcelo Rios, a qualifier from 
Chile who at 18 was the youngest and lowest-ranked player in the men's field. 
Sampras beat last year's junior world champion, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier also had a difficult time overcoming Stefano Pescosolido of Italy, 
7-5, 6-0, 6-7 (9-7), 6-4. Pescosolido held off five match points before losing. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the day's attention focused on Agassi-Muster. The matched marked 
Muster's fourth victory over Agassi in five meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, 23, runner-up here in 1990 and '91, was unseeded for the first time in 
a Grand Slam event since 1987 because his ranking has dropped to No. 19 after a 
five-month layoff caused by a wrist injury. He had surgery in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi lost badly on clay in Monte Carlo and Rome this spring and has had 
problems with umpires in his last three outings. 
</P>
<P>
 But when all seemed lost in the fifth set, Agassi responded. Muster served 
twice for the match at 5-2 and 5-4, but Agassi broke each time. Then Muster 
broke Agassi for a 6-5 lead. Serving for the match a third time, he got to 
40-30 with a forehand winner and finally ended it with a backhand volley that 
Agassi hit wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional children's day Wednesday brought out the high-pitched voices 
of France's future players. On the first Wednesday of each French Open, 5,000 
seats are reserved for youth from the country's tennis clubs. It's an idea that 
Brad Stine, coach of No. 4-ranked Andrei Medvedev, thinks should be copied by 
the U.S. Open. "I've been telling them to do that for four years," said Stine, 
who left Jim Courier to coach Medvedev this year.  
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Sergi Bruguera, the defending champion, scored a 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) 
victory over No. 135 Christian Ruud of Norway. . . . Also reaching the third 
round were Medvedev of Ukraine, who defeated Nicklas Kulti of Sweden, 6-4, 7-6 
(7-4), 4-6, 7-5, and No. 12 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, who beat 
Thierry Champion of France, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.

DAVENPORT WINS OVER BEST FRIEND RUBIN FOR SECOND TIME IN A WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing against her best friend once in a week was enough for Lindsay 
Davenport, the 17-year-old Murrieta Valley High senior who opened the French 
Open against Chanda Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, who often trained and traveled together in the U.S. Tennis Assn. 
touring pro program, met in the semifinals of a clay-court tournament in 
Lucerne, Switzerland, last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport won by default when Rubin, from Lafayette, La., retired in the 
second set because of a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roland Garros Stadium Wednesday, Davenport won again, 6-7 (7-2), 6-4, 6-2, 
in a first-round match that took two days to finish because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would have rather started against someone else," said Robert Van't Hof, 
Davenport's coach. "It's always tough for them to play each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 9-ranked Davenport, who skipped her high school prom to play in 
Lucerne, was one of four-seeded women to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Steffi Graf, who usually blows through the early rounds, had some 
problems with No. 67 Stephanie Rottier of the Netherlands before rallying for a 
7-5, 6-3 victory on Court 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of had the feeling when I got into the match, 'I am not playing well,' 
" Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
 After such domination this year, why the struggles? 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happens," she said, adding that she had felt uncomfortable on a court 
usually used by lesser players. 
</P>
<P>
 With six of the seeded women, including four of the top eight, losing their 
opening matches, Davenport, No. 10 Mary Joe Fernandez, No. 12 Mary Pierce and 
No. 15 Helena Sukova have become Graf's prime challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez ousted Angelica Galvadon of Mexico, 6-0, 6-1, to advance to the 
third round with Pierce, who defeated Maria-Francesca Bentivoglio of Italy, 
6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sukova, of the Czech Republic, defeated Clare Wood of Britain, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.

INDIANAPOLIS 500 DAILY REPORT; FANTASIES GO FROM SUBLIME (PRESIDENT) TO THE

 What other line of work would race drivers prefer? 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson Fittipaldi and Mario Andretti dream of being fighter pilots, Lyn St. 
James would like to be President of the United States, Dominic Dobson and 
Jacques Villeneuve would be musicians and Roberto Guerrero would be a tennis or 
golf professional, according to a survey of drivers by a watch manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 But how about Stan Fox and Hiro Matsushita? Fox would like to take Tonya 
Harding for a lap around Indy; Matsushita dreams of being Indiana Jones. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Of the 33 drivers in Sunday's 500, only one, Fittipaldi, has a vanity license 
plate: EF 500. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Not satisfied with being the fastest woman in closed-course racing, and 
qualifying ahead of three former Indianapolis 500 winners, St. James is 
planning an assault on Al Teague's piston-driven land speed record of 409.9 
m.p.h. Her husband, Roger Lessman, is in charge of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 A streamliner, designed by Indy car builder Bob Riley of Indianapolis, is 
expected to be ready to run at the Bonneville Salt Flats next year. It will be 
fueled by natural gas, Lessmansaid. 
</P>
<P>
 St. James had a top speed of 234 m.p.h. during her qualifying run, but she 
still isn't the fastest driver in the family. Roger ran 292.719 in 1989 at 
Bonneville.

 If rookie Bryan Herta can win the 500 from his 22nd starting position Sunday, 
he will earn a $1-million "Slo Poke" bonus from a candy maker. Herta is the 
slowest qualifier for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 No slowest qualifier has ever won. Gary Bettenhausen came closest when he 
finished third after starting 33rd in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest starting position of a winning driver is 28th by Ray Harroun in 
1911 and Louis Meyer in 1936. SHAV GLICK

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; APPIER STRIKES OUT 13 IN ONLY 5 2/3 INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Appier struck out 13 in only 5 2/3 innings and the Kansas City Royals 
defeated the Texas Rangers, 8-3, Wednesday night at Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Appier (4-5) struck out every Texas starter and Will Clark three times. He 
struck out the side in the second and fifth innings and nearly matched Mark 
Gubicza's club mark of 14 strikeouts set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-hander, who has fought a season-long slump, took a two-hitter and a 
4-0 lead into the sixth. But he gave up a two-run homer to Ivan Rodriguez and a 
triple to Chris James before being relieved by Billy Brewer after throwing 108 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Appier walked three and fell one short of the American League's season high 
for strikeouts, set by Toronto's Pat Hentgen. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer and Rusty Meacham combined to strike out three more Rangers. The total 
of 16 strikeouts by the Royals tied a team record. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the Royals' runs were unearned, including all three in the sixth. 
After third baseman Dean Palmer bobbled Felix Jose's grounder for the Rangers' 
third error, the Royals scored on Greg Gagne's bases-loaded walk, a double-play 
grounder and Vince Coleman's run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 12, Minnesota 1 -- Frank Thomas hit two homers and Alex Fernandez gave 
up four hits over eight innings to lead the White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas went four for five, drove in five runs to match a career-high and hit 
his 16th and 17th homers to help the White Sox win their season-high fifth 
consecutive game and eighth in their last nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Pulido (2-4) gave up four runs and six hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is batting .474 (27 for 57) with 30 runs in his last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox scored five runs in the eighth, highlighted by Ron Karkovice's 
three-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Toronto 2 -- Wade Boggs, showing a sudden power surge, hit two 
home runs and led Jim Abbott and the Yankees past the Blue Jays at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Boggs, who did not homer in the Yankees' first 35 games, has hit five home 
runs in his last five games. He had the fourth multi-homer game of his career, 
and first since May of 1992. He drove in three runs and got four of New York's 
16 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott (6-2) pitched a six-hitter for his fifth consecutive victory. He struck 
out four and walked two in his first complete game since his no-hitter last 
Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The benches and bullpen emptied in the eighth after Luis Polonia, who had four 
hits, was thrown out stealing at third base to end the inning. Polonia took 
exception to what he thought was a hard tag by Toronto third baseman Ed 
Sprague. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill went two for four, raising his major league-leading average to 
.472. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Milwaukee 3 -- Jamie Moyer gave up six hits over eight innings at 
Milwaukee as the Orioles handed the Brewers their 14th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The last AL team to lose 14 in a row was the Seattle Mariners in 1992. 
Milwaukee, which last won on May 10, lost a three-game series at home for the 
first time since April 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore matched its longest winning streak of the season with its fourth 
straight victory and Moyer (2-3), who began the game with a 6.39 ERA, won for 
the first time since April 19. Lee Smith got out of a bases-loaded jam in the 
ninth for his major league-leading 19th save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles rocked Milwaukee starter Michael Ignasiak (1-1) for five runs in 
the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 1, Oakland 0 -- Randy Johnson struck out nine and Dan Wilson drove in 
the lone run at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners had lost two in a row, including an embarrassing 10-1 defeat to 
Oakland on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, A's starter Ron Darling, who lost while pitching a 
complete game, walked Tino Martinez, who advanced to second on Mike Blowers' 
single to left. Felix Fermin tapped a sacrifice bunt before Wilson's hopper to 
right scored Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson (5-3) held the A's hitless until Scott Hemond got a single to center 
in the third inning.

<P>
 The Florida Marlins are interested in acquiring J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have told other teams that they're only interested in obtaining 
pitchers for Snow, so if the Marlins make a proposal, the Angels will have 
solid information on which to base a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 New Manager Marcel Lachemann, who was Florida's pitching coach until a week 
ago, knows the Marlin pitching prospects better than anyone in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Frank Tanana, who was released by the Angels in spring training, 
visited his former teammates for the first time and told them his baseball 
career is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels strange being at home this time of year, but it's kind of nice," 
Tanana said. "I think I'm going to enjoy this." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Manager Sparky Anderson of the Detroit Tigers said he'll never forget the 
advice former Angel manager Gene Mauch gave him on opening day 24 years ago, 
and believes that Mauch belongs in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was opening day in 1970 when Gene Mauch tugged on my pants and said, 
'Remember this day, because you'll never have that day again,' "Anderson said. 
"I've lived by that my whole career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect Gene Mauch more than any manager I've ever known. There's never 
been a manager so intense and so knowledgeable at the same time." BOB

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; GIANTS' SWIFT IS OUT UNTIL AT LEAST 
JUNE 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants put pitcher Bill Swift on the 15-day disabled list 
Wednesday, retroactive to May 18, because of inflammation in the muscle under 
his right armpit. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift, who leads the Giants' staff with a 6-3 record and a 2.61 earned-run 
average, will be eligible to pitch again on June 2. He returned to San 
Francisco from San Diego to be examined by the team physician, Warren King. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift, the 1993 National League Cy Young Award runner-up to the Atlanta 
Braves' Greg Maddux, was hurt while pitching in Houston on May 17. Bill Van 
Landingham will make his first major league start today against the Padres, in 
place of Swift, who will be replaced on the roster by right-handed reliever 
Tony Menendez, recalled from triple-A Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 St. Louis' Allen Watson and Bernard Gilkey and Florida's Orestes Destrade were 
suspended by the National League for participating in a bench-clearing brawl, 
and shortly thereafter, the Marlins decided to part company with Destrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was suspended for eight games for intentionally hitting Destrade with a 
pitch and then throwing his glove at Destrade after he charged the mound Sunday 
during a game in Miami. Watson hit Destrade in the back after giving up three 
home runs to the Marlins in the second inning. Gilkey was suspended for four 
games for making contact with an umpire during the melee. 
</P>
<P>
 Destrade was suspended for four games for charging the mound and hitting 
Watson.  
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins designated Destrade's contract for assignment, which gives them 10 
days to determine his status. Options include trading or releasing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with the decision they're making," said Destrade, 32, who was 
batting .208. "I know I've struggled this year. It still comes as a surprise." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Umpires Ken Kaiser and Mark Johnson were treated at hospitals after a minor 
auto accident less than an hour before the game between the Cleveland Indians 
and the Red Sox in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The game began with only two umpires, John Shulock and Tim Tschida, but was 
called after two scoreless innings because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser, 48, and Johnson, 43, were treated and released from separate 
hospitals, spokesmen said. Kaiser's rental car was hit in the rear by a van 
about two blocks from Fenway Park at about 6:10 p.m., state trooper Matthew 
Favale said.

 Barry Bonds hit his 13th homer and John Burkett won for the first time in five 
starts as the San Francisco Giants won at San Diego, 5-2, Wednesday night, 
ending their season-high six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirt Manwaring and Todd Benzinger had run-scoring doubles and John Patterson 
went three for four for the Giants, who began the game tied with San Diego for 
the worst batting average in the majors at .244. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkett (4-3) stopped a personal streak that included two losses and two 
no-decisions. He gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings. Rod Beck 
worked the ninth for his eighth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Three unearned runs in the third helped continue a streak of bad luck for Andy 
Ashby (0-5), winless in 12 starts since September. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 6, Houston 5 -- Jeff Blauser doubled home the winning run with one out 
in the 13th inning after an Astro misplay, giving the Braves a victory in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Belliard singled with one out and Deion Sanders followed with a 
grounder to second baseman Chris Donnels. But shortstop Andujar Cedeno, trying 
to turn a double play, failed to tag second as he caught the throw from 
Donnels, and both runners were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Blauser, who drove in two runs earlier, then hit his game-winning double. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bielecki (1-0), who hadn't pitched in 11 days, earned the victory with 
three scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Florida 1 -- Darrin Fletcher drove in two runs and Ken Hill got 
his eighth victory as the Expos beat the Marlins at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill (8-2) tied St. Louis' Bob Tewksbury for the National League lead in 
victories. He left the bases loaded twice while giving up one run, five hits 
and a season-high three walks in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wetteland pitched two scoreless innings for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's Gary Sheffield, activated from the disabled list before the game 
after recovering from a shoulder injury, went 0 for 4. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Pittsburgh 3 -- Jose Vizcaino's two-run single keyed the Mets' 
second consecutive late-inning comeback at Pittsburgh for a victory that sent 
the Pirates to their 10th loss in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Saberhagen (5-2) kept the Pirates in their monthlong offensive slump by 
pitching five-hit ball in six innings before leaving with muscle spasms in his 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullpen nearly blew his 4-1 lead as the Pirates scored twice in the 
seventh after a 1-hour 32-minute rain delay on Don Slaught's run-scoring double 
and Tom Foley's run-scoring single against Josias Manzanillo. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 10, Philadelphia 5 -- Ray Lankford homered, doubled twice and drove 
in three runs as the Cardinals beat the Phillies at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pagnozzi homered and doubled and Mark Whiten also homered for St. Louis, 
which set a major league record Tuesday by stranding 16 runners in a shutout 
loss. The Cardinals took a 4-3 lead with two runs in the sixth and scored five 
more in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Incaviglia homered for the fourth time in four games for the Phillies, 
who were bidding to reach the .500 mark for the first time since April 21. 
Philadelphia lost for only the third time in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Eversgerd (2-0) got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 3, Cincinnati 2 -- Andres Galarraga's home run in the sixth inning 
broke a 2-2 tie at Denver, sending the Rockies to their third straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's 16th homer came off Jose Rijo (2-3), who failed in his third 
attempt to get the 100th victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Harkey (1-4) pitched two innings of two-hit relief for the victory. Bruce 
Ruffin finished up for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds have lost five in a row, including the first three games of a 
seven-game trip.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; IT'S FERGUSON TO RUSSELL TO FIELDERS

 Last year's bench coach, Joe Ferguson, was replaced this season by Bill 
Russell. But Ferguson, who is in his eighth year as a Dodger coach, is still 
working with the catchers in practice and is now positioning Dodger fielders 
from the press box during games. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing scientific, though, about the way Ferguson relays information 
to the bench. "Billy looks up at me in the press box and I give him the signs," 
Ferguson said. "Then he relays them to the fielders." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda credits Ferguson, a major league catcher for 14 seasons 
and with the Dodgers from 1978-81, with the development of Mike Piazza.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I VOLLEYBALL; GRAVE, ZIEGLER PUSH OILERS PAST EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Huntington Beach captains Mike Grave and Nick Ziegler wouldn't let their team 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers survived four match points and outlasted top-seeded El Toro in a 
three-hour match, winning the fifth game, 18-16, of the Southern Section 
Division I semifinal boys' volleyball semifinal Wednesday before a crowd of 
1,000 at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 Grave had 33 kills, 12 in the fifth game, and Ziegler had 21 kills, 10 in the 
last game, to lead the unseeded Oilers to an 11-15, 15-7, 8-15, 15-11, 18-16 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just hung in there," Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said. "It was 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (20-2), the defending Division I champion, advanced to play 
Laguna Beach in the 7:30 p.m. final Saturday at Cerritos College. El Toro 
finished 19-2. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro, which defeated Huntington Beach in the final of the Orange County 
Championships earlier this season, threw everything it had at the Oilers but 
couldn't put the match away. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro outside hitter Ryan Mariano had 31 kills, 12 in the fifth game, and 
setter Todd Steinert had 82 assists, nine kills and four blocks to lead a 
balanced offense. Doug Thompson added 24 kills and Chris Jacobson had 20 kills 
and three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 14-14, in the fifth game, the teams traded nine 
consecutive side outs before Bill Coblentz blocked Grave for a side out, then 
Steinert blocked Grave again for a 15-14 El Toro lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grave spiked for two side outs when the Chargers were serving for the 
match and a net violation erased a third El Toro match point. Then Huntington 
Beach setter Josh Moss, who had 71 assists and three blocks, blocked Thompson 
to even the score, 15-15. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro took a 16-15 lead on a Coblentz tip, but Ziegler spiked from the 
middle for a side out to erase the fourth match point. Ziegler blocked Coblentz 
for another point, helping the Oilers win three consecutive points and the 
match.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION III VOLLEYBALL; SANTA YNEZ ENDS WHITTIER CHRISTIAN'S 
PLAYOFF STREAK 
</P>

<P>
 The Whittier Christian boys' volleyball team didn't get its wish Wednesday 
night n the semifinals of the Southern Section Division III playoffs at La 
Serna High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ynez beat the third-seeded Heralds, 15-13, 14-16, 15-9, 17-15, and ended 
their hopes of sending Coach Dave Herron to a Southern Section final for the 
fourth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-time defending section champions stayed with second-seeded Santa 
Ynez (20-2) in each of the first two games, earning a split with a 16-14 win in 
Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Tim Willey and Tyler Ream each had five kills, helping the Heralds 
twice battle back from three-point deficits and scored the last three points of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 3, the momentum swung back to Santa Ynez, which trailed only once and 
won 15-9 to build a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Andy Witt and junior Matt Williams led the way for Santa Ynez down 
the stretch. Witt had 11 of his 32 kills in the last two games and Williams 
added eight in each game to finish with 30 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't let a lot of balls get down," said Herron, who is leaving to take 
a collegiate job in Wisconsin. "They got the balls up and knew where to go. 
They didn't panic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds trailed early in the fourth game, falling behind 7-3 and 10-5 
before mounting a rally. They tied the score, 13-13, with the help of two kills 
by Willey. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ynez jumped ahead three different times before Williams' kill slammed 
the door, 17-15.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I VOLLEYBALL; LAGUNA BEACH SURVIVES TO BEAT LOYOLA IN 
FIVE GAMES 
</P>

 It took 3 hours 20 minutes for Laguna Beach to beat Los Angeles Loyola, 9-15, 
15-8, 15-13, 12-15, 16-14, in a Division I boys' volleyball semifinal Wednesday 
at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Artists (17-1) will meet Huntington Beach in the title match 
at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in the playoffs, Laguna Beach was a point away from being 
eliminated when the Cubs took a 14-13 lead and held serve in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dan Styles and Beau Bianchi, who had 36 and 27 kills, respectively, 
kept the Artists alive with several key plays. After Styles held off Loyola 
with a pair of crucial side outs, Bianchi put a spike on the line to draw the 
Artists even, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams then traded side outs before Bianchi teamed with Trevor Whalley on a 
block to give the Artists a match point. Loyola outside hitter Davy Olsen was 
then whistled for sliding under the net, giving Laguna Beach the deciding 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just like the (second-round) Dana Hills game," Bianchi said. "They 
had us match point, but we came back." 
</P>
<P>
 After quietly losing the first game, the Artists came to life in Game 2 and 
jumped out to a 14-4 lead before finally putting the Cubs away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third game, the Artists blew leads of 10-5 and 13-10, but eventually 
won the game on a Justin Maison service ace. The biggest battle was in Game 4 
as the teams went through 22 consecutive side outs before the Cubs won.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION III VOLLEYBALL; UNDEFEATED CALVARY CHAPEL SWEEPS 
CERRITOS VALLEY CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Undefeated Calvary Chapel swept Cerritos Valley Christian, 15-4, 15-3, 15-10, 
in a Southern Section Division III boys' volleyball semifinal match Wednesday 
at Estancia High. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Calvary Chapel advanced to Saturday's final against Santa 
Ynez at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (17-0) seemed to put on a clinic in the first two games, while the 
Crusaders (13-7) gave no indication as to how they got this far in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Christian made 16 errors in the first game, eight in the second and 
could muster only seven points, most of which came on Calvary Chapel mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-point run in the first game, and four three-point runs in the second 
should have firmed up Calvary Chapel's emotional advantage, but the Eagles 
refused to become complacent and give the Crusaders a chance to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been easy to relax (after the first two games)," Eagle Coach 
Chuck Wright said. "And we haven't been playing well. We beat Valley in four 
(games) just before the season ended, and in the playoffs we haven't had a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two games Valley Christian's passing was poor, but the Crusaders 
seemed to regroup in the third, and actually led twice, 3-0 and 5-4. But the 
Eagles capitalized on 12 errors and never let Valley Christian tie again. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 11-10, the Crusaders committed a ball-handling error, Mark Vanderlay hit 
wide, Aaron Fountain and Steve Lefevre blocked Mark Overdine and Fountain 
spiked off Jeremy Debee for the match.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I BADMINTON; OVERMATCHED GARDEN GROVE ROUTED BY 
KEPPEL IN FINAL 
</P>

<P>
 On one hand, Garden Grove's badminton team played as well as any team has 
against Alhambra Keppel, which has not given up more than five points all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Argonauts were handily defeated by Keppel, 15-4, in the 
Southern Section Division I team badminton final Wednesday at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were overmatched today," Argonaut Coach Vicki Toutz said. "Keppel is a 
very dominant team. We played very respectable today. We're a very young team 
and I never expected us to get this far." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs, the Southern Section defending champions, won the first eight 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their team is very strong," Aztec Coach Harold George said. "It just happens 
that our strength is where their strengths are." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Mike Lam scored the first point for the Argonauts with a 15-8, 10-15, 
15-7 singles victory over Ken Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 By that point, the Argonauts knew they were playing for respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was this more evident than in Vil Nonliboun's singles match against 
Lam. After losing his matches in mixed doubles and first singles, the senior 
fought back from a 9-4 deficit in the third game to defeat Lam, 5-15, 15-7, 
15-12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vil has not performed as well as he wanted to in his last couple of matches," 
Toutz said. "I'm glad that he was able to come back and finish (the season) 
with a strong performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing in the third game, Nonliboun used drop shots and smashes to win the 
next four points and close the gap to 9-8. After exchanging points, Nonliboun 
tied the score, 11-11, with a net-hugging redrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonliboun took a 14-12 lead with a smash down the line and won the set with a 
strong smash down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always put 100% and try to do the best that I can," Nonliboun said. 
"Sometimes I'm successful, sometimes I'm overmatched. Against (Lam) I was 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts' two other points came from its doubles teams. Dung Cu and David 
Nguyen defeated Jacky Wu and Tony Tan, 15-2, 4-15, 15-10. Rashi Gupta and Hanh 
Le defeated Cindy Wong and Aileen Dong, 15-10, 15-9.

NO LIGHTNING BOLTS FOR U.S. SOCCER; EXHIBITION: AMERICANS PLAY TO SCORELESS TIE

 Bora Milutinovic continues to insist that increasingly skeptical observers of 
his U.S. soccer team should look at the big picture, and, considering that he 
is about to embark upon his third World Cup coaching campaign, perhaps his 
advice should be heeded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, however, difficult to see anything other than the little picture at 
Rutgers University's Yurcak Field, which on Wednesday featured two minnows 
swimming upstream for 90 minutes before time mercifully ran out on them. 
Energetic, yes. Fruitful, no. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Saudi Arabia, two World Cup longshots, played to a 
scoreless draw in an exhibition that probably will be remembered by the 
capacity crowd of 5,576 primarily for a period when play was halted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in metal bleachers, the spectators were ordered to leave the small 
soccer/lacrosse stadium in the 72nd minute when a late afternoon thundershower 
was accompanied by lightning. Although many disobeyed, they at least were 
warned. As for the players, they retired to their dressing rooms until the game 
was resumed 23 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Americans, the timing could not have been worse because they seemed to 
have taken charge from the start of the second half, which, not coincidentally, 
was also when Milutinovic inserted Tab Ramos into the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge no doubt was frustrating for striker Frank Klopas to watch from the 
bench. After scoring six goals in six games, he played the first 45 minutes 
Wednesday but touched the ball only twice as the United States failed to 
sustain a cohesive attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, however, guided the team forward, and although neither he nor his 
teammates could finish any of the chances created, the U.S. coaches left the 
game feeling optimistic about the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is another matter. After his team lost, 3-2, to Bayern Munich last 
Saturday, Milutinovic at least temporarily shelved a defense that featured five 
men in front of the goalkeeper for the more familiar four-man alignment. But 
the system apparently is not the culprit.  
</P>
<P>
 A lack of speed, experience and, occasionally, effort resulted in several 
scoring chances for Saudi Arabia. If the Saudis had been more skilled, or if 
goalkeeper Tony Meola had not played so well, the result certainly would have 
been a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of Switzerland, I think of cheese and our defense in the last 
couple of games, and the analogy is there," said Hank Steinbrecher, executive 
director of the U.S. Soccer Federation. "Our defense is porous." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland is relevant because it is the United States' first World Cup 
opponent, on June 18 in Pontiac, Mich. Only two exhibition games remain for the 
Americans to solve their problems, Saturday against Greece in New Haven, Conn., 
and June 4 against Mexico at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping we can get better than this," Ramos said. "We have to be at our 
top level to have any chance at all in the World Cup. We don't have Saudi 
Arabia in our group." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic, however, continues to remind his players to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, Saudi Arabia is not important," he said. "What's important is the 
game against Switzerland."

KRONE FINISHES THIRD IN COMEBACK RACE

 Riding for the first time since suffering a broken ankle at Saratoga on Aug. 
30, Julie Krone finished third on Baypark in Wednesday's fourth race at Belmont 
Park, then was eighth on Life Boat in the $50,000 Bouwerie Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone, 30, still walks with a small limp and has plates and screws in her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming back is great in itself," she said. "I really wanted to win the race, 
but coming in third didn't spoil the feeling of elation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to win today, and when I got past the wire, it was hard to stand up 
in the saddle and as much water as I drank before the race I was still thirsty. 
But, except for that, butterflies and shaking muscles, I felt fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman to win a Triple Crown race when she won the Belmont Stakes 
last year on Colonial Affair, Krone thanked her doctor and the fans who sent 
her get-well wishes during her recovery. BOB MIESZERSKI

HORSE RACING; BIEN BIEN GETS 124, SO DOES ARCANGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bien Bien and Arcangues, who will meet for the first time in the $500,000 
Hollywood Turf Handicap on Monday, were each assigned 124 pounds for the 1 
1/4-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Bien Bien carried 122 against a suspect field and won the 
San Juan Capistrano Handicap on April 24 in his last start.Arcangues also 
carried 122 pounds while winning the John Henry Handicap on May 1 in his first 
start since winning the Breeders' Cup Classic last Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Bien Bien) is one of the two most-accomplished turf horses in the 
world today," said Arcangues' trainer, Richard Mandella. "Arcangues might be 
there eventually, but right now I don't know. He won only one Group 1 grass 
race in Europe, and Bien Bien has proven himself again and again." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three others will probably run in the Grade I stake: Misil (119) and the 
Rodney Rash pair of Navarone (118) and Blues Traveller (114). Second to 
Arcangues in the John Henry, Misil worked five furlongs in 59 2/5 Wednesday, 
the best of 39 workouts at the distance.

 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer, not a heart attack, killed Easy Goer, who collapsed and died outside 
his paddock at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Ky., on May 12. A necropsy done by T.W. 
Swerczek showed the malignancy had spread through the 8-year-old horse's liver, 
lungs and intestinal membranes. . . . Johnny Mc, the gelding whose identity had 
been switched with Stalvoy's for well over a month before the mistake was 
discovered a week ago, is entered in today's fourth race, a six-furlong 
allowance event for California-breds. . . . A $12 wager landed an unidentified 
person the lone perfect ticket in Sunday's Pick Six, worth $315,553.20. The 
bettor cashed the ticket at the Cabazon intertrack facility in Indio.

PREP MEET AT A GLANCE; CITY SECTION TRACK AND FIELD FINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's schedule: Field events begin at 3 p.m. and running events at 4:30 at 
Van Nuys Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year's champions: Boys' team -- Dorsey; girls' team -- University. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Dorsey boys are expected to breeze to their second consecutive 
title with 12 qualifiers in the finals. Birmingham, last year's runner-up, is 
next with 11. Dorsey sprinter Leo Settle is favored in the 100 and 200 meters 
and also runs on the 400 and 1,600 relays. "We feel we're going to take City by 
a good 20 points. We have too much depth," Settle said. Andre DeSaussure of 
Woodland Hills Taft won the 100, 200 and 400 at last year's meet, but he will 
compete only in the 400 today after cutting back his schedule. In the girls' 
competition, University is not expected to repeat. Gardena, Washington, 
Woodland Hills El Camino Real, Westchester, Hamilton and Dorsey are among the 
favorites. Betty Butler of Dorsey could be a double-event winner after posting 
the fastest qualifying times in the 400 and 800. ERIC SHEPARD

 Slip Into Summer 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of that whole feel of gardening, staying at home and visiting 
flea markets for old, beautiful things," says L.A.-based designer David Dart 
about his current collection. His antique kimono floral print pieces (left) 
typify this best in staple silhouettes that have been altered just enough to 
make them stand apart from other labels. Take his long slip dress featuring an 
empire waist ($156). "I chose red for the print," Dart adds, "because it's what 
comes to mind with summer." Time to Go Under

 Ten billion dollars worth of nighties, panties and other unmentionables? 
That's what the Intimate Apparel Council estimates industry sales to hit by 
1997. So the folks at Clothestime decided to offer their, uh, support with the 
opening of Lingerie Time. Stores in Anaheim Hills, Huntington Beach, Dana Point 
and Placentia debuted this last week stocked with Christian Dior, Lily of 
France, Maidenform, Warner, Natori and other brands at 30% to 70% below regular 
price. "The neoclassic environ is like nothing we've done before," says 
spokeswoman Jane Whaley. Fear in Demand 
</P>
<P>
 What separates London's hip young things from L.A.'s? Fashion-wise, very 
little. We tend to be more radical with things like body piercing, and while 
our surf wear stays at the beach, it reincarnates into club wear in the rarely 
sunny UK. Stussy struck great success that way, and now San Diego's No Fear is 
seeing similar appeal. Beanies with the in-your-face company name top house 
fans -- who likely have no clue to the label's origins. Wrist Action 
</P>
<P>
 Swatchees pressed to wear both the chronograph and scuba models on their wrist 
can now wear one watch -- the Swatch AquaChrono ($85). "It has all the 
functions of both watches combined in an oversized look that's a big fashion 
statement now," says spokeswoman Amy Edelson. The new timepiece (right) is 
water resistant to 200 meters -- because, reminds product copy -- the earth is 
70% water. If one Swatch is still not enough, wrap around a blue, green, red, 
black or silver one. The latter two are winning fashion slaves whose only 
jungle gym is the urbanscape, adds Edelson. ROSE APODACA JONES

FAUX PAS REPORT: LUGGING CAMERA IS LESS THAN PICTURE-PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At receptions, proms or any memorable event, you'll see women, dressed in 
expensive dresses, carrying cameras to record the festivities. Although they 
may be excellent photographers, those who carry around a 35-millimeter with a 
zoom lens and flash ruin the picture of themselves they're trying to create. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lugging around a big camera all evening is fine if you're not that interested 
in making an impression," says Stephanie Grani of Stephania in San Juan 
Capistrano. "But if it really matters and you want to take pictures, get the 
smallest camera you can find." 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure your evening bag is large enough to carry your camera, even if you 
have to remove the lipstick, pager and tissue. If that doesn't work and you 
still want to take a camera, try the old trick of letting your escort carry it 
around. Let your date commit the faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of pocket: There's been the past few years a conspiracy in the clothing 
industry worthy of an Oliver Stone movie. Someone has decided that men don't 
need pockets in their sport shirts, and now it's become harder than Hades to 
find a place to keep your sunglasses when you're indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, when you stuff that golf shirt full of tees or pencils or even a 
pocket phone, you're not looking your best. But guys continue to search out 
those few pocketed polo-style shirts and fill their pockets to the top with 
junk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a passe look, one that goes in and out of style from time to time," says 
Chris Lockwood of Pendleton Sport Shop in Laguna Hills. "It may be out now, but 
it's sure to return." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have to have that pocket for your polo, try looking through golf wear 
catalogues. But don't make the mistake of thinking it'll transfer easily from 
the fairway to the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 The curse of Anna: Just about the time she made it look as though buxom was in 
again, model Anna Nicole Smith began to grow in other directions and continued 
wearing those tight-enough-to-peel-off dresses. Other women are following her 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pretty sight to see a woman who's wearing a dress that's too 
tight," says Susan Shaw of Dancegear in Newport Beach. "You need to use some 
discretion when wearing form-fitting clothes. You need to look at yourself and 
say, 'Do I really look good in this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 A convenient yardstick to see if a dress is too tight is to hunt for bulges. 
If your bra and panties are clearly defined, or if, good heavens, a stomach 
pouch is visible, it's time to let Anna be the only Anna while you get a larger 
size.

HE SAID / SHE SAID: THE HIGH PRICE OF BUYER'S REMORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT and ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I t's kind of like your first crush, when you fall instantly in love and then 
decide a couple of weeks later that your object of desire has an irritating 
laugh.  
</P>
<P>
 There you are, blissfully on vacation in some faraway paradise, and you see an 
article of clothing that everyone seems to be wearing and that strikes you as 
so utterly right for the moment that you decide you've got to have one of your 
own at all costs.  
</P>
<P>
 So you buy it. And wear it once. And take it home. And look at it a couple of 
weeks later and get hit between the eyes with the most devastating case of 
buyer's remorse you've ever had.  
</P>
<P>
 HE: Hats are my downfall. Because hats can be kind of festive, you feel good 
when you're wearing them on vacation, but most of them just don't seem to work 
at home. I have two tweed caps, one bought on vacation in Scotland, another on 
a trip to Ireland, and though I loved wearing them all over those two countries 
-- particularly while golfing and horseback riding, where they look really cool 
-- I think I've worn both of them exactly once here in the U.S. of A. They look 
good, and they're perfect for crashing around in peat bogs, but here in SoCal 
they're just too damn hot. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I've finally learned my lesson, though. Three years ago I was in 
Russia and decided I had to have a fur hat. It turned into an obsession. I 
actually considered getting one made out of silver fox fur (and taking out a 
second mortgage to do it). Then one day a voice from the sky said, "You're a 
moron. You live in Southern California. What are you going to do, wear a 
Russian fur hat to a Dodgers game? Get a lacquer box instead." 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Everything is my downfall. Put me in a foreign locale, and the third 
thing I do is go shopping. (First, I unpack. Then, I check out the immediate 
area.) It's my way of soaking up the culture. I stay clear of chain stores, 
make it a point to visit local artisans and seamstresses. 
</P>
<P>
 So, already I've set myself up for purchases that end up in the back of a 
closet or bottom drawer. Take the pricey Panama I bought in Santa Fe last 
summer. I paid a fortune for it, wore it a couple of times in New Mexico and 
haven't donned it since. It looked groovy there, with my boots, linen pantsuit 
and turquoise jewelry. Here? Overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I don't know what it is about me and cold-weather clothes, but I tend to 
go on vacation in the winter, to cold places, and these duds exert a powerful 
pull on me. I bought an Aran wool sweater in England back in 1974, and I think 
I've worn it here at home about half a dozen times. It's beautiful, it's 
bulletproof, but it can make you sweat if you're sitting on a cake of dry ice. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip to London a few Decembers ago, I noticed that everyone was wearing 
these spiffy knee-length navy wool overcoats made by an outfit called Crombie. 
What the heck, I thought, I'll get one. Then, still shivering, I remembered 
that the pipe rack in my closet probably wouldn't even support a coat that 
heavy. It also cost several hundred bucks. Saved again. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: How do I waste money on vacation shopping trips? Let me count the ways: 
There are those four glittery face veils I picked up in Cairo (I used them 
later at a Halloween party); the handmade leather vest I bought in Texas (wore 
it to a Western party once ); the stiletto-heeled pumps I flipped over in 
Florence (gave them away -- they killed my back); and the logo T-shirts I buy 
everywhere. I've found a great use for the shirts: first, they're summer PJs, 
then . . . dust cloths. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Is there such a thing as non-buyer's remorse? If there is, I had it in 
spades several years ago on a trip to Switzerland. I went on a day trip to 
Zermatt to see the Matterhorn and wandered into a sporting goods store.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside was the world's greatest ski sweater: light green with red bands around 
each sleeve with white crosses in the middle of the bands. It was the Swiss ski 
team's official sweater. The sleeve bands represented the Swiss flag. It cost 
about $75, which was murderously expensive on a student's shoestring budget. 
</P>
<P>
 I agonized over that thing all day and finally got on the train without it. I 
still have pangs of regret about that one. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Wish I could get my hands on some of that remorse. I never seem to pass 
anything up. This time, I tell myself before a trip, I'll concentrate on the 
area's landscape, museums, parks, people. Forget clothing and accessories. The 
suitcase is packed. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 But after one day -- sometimes a few hours -- I'm poking around in a little 
shop operated by locals who thrive on the tourist trade. And I buy something -- 
something I may wear only a few times. So what if it ends up in a the 
guest-room closet? For a wonderful little while, we had an exotic time 
together.

 Individualism is well and good, but why fight the system -- especially if

</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders graduated five of their six starters from last year's Southern 
Section Division II runner-up squad, which would seem to call for at least one 
rebuilding year. 
</P>
<P>
 But what happens? Coach Bob Ferguson plugs in five new starters and Royal 
advances to the final again, for the sixth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 South Torrance was the semifinal victim this year, falling, 15-10, 16-14, 
15-10, Wednesday night at Mira Costa High. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal (17-3) will play Highland on Saturday for the Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows what kind of a program we have, that we can lose five starters and 
and make it back to the finals," said Royal setter Josh White, the lone 
returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so proud of these guys who have come up and worked so hard. They've 
improved 200%." 
</P>
<P>
 White, a 6-foot-1 senior, had 58 assists and orchestrated Royal's complex 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 That attack was the difference between the Highlanders and Spartans, indeed 
between Royal and most teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders run a wide variety of formations and plays, with attackers 
approaching the net at all angles to confuse the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to run as many different combinations as possible," White said. "It's 
to distract the middle blockers, so they have no clue where I'm going with the 
ball. That way it frees everyone up to hit one on one." 
</P>
<P>
 South Torrance (14-3), for instance, was arguably just as talented, athletic 
and tall as Royal. But Ferguson's team was better-drilled, more versatile and 
more sure of itself in pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Royal gave up five consecutive points and trailed, 13-11. 
</P>
<P>
 South Torrance fans were stomping and screaming, Spartan players were in the 
throes of an adrenaline rush and Royal appeared vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Royal players, who would appear relaxed if they won the lottery, kept 
their cool, executed and waited for South Torrance to make the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal's Scott Hambly hit one of his 15 kills to get Royal a crucial sideout. 
</P>
<P>
 South Torrance setter Noel Dourmerc made two poor sets, sandwiched around a 
kill by Highlander middle blocker Matt Olsen, and Royal led, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Several serves later, Olsen put the game away with a one of his 17 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal scored 11 consecutive points in the third game to take an 11-4 
advantage, and cruised the rest of the way.

OVERCOMING BIG OBSTACLE, HIGHLAND REACHES FINAL; BOYS' VOLLEYBALL: BULLDOGS 
SWEEP INTO THE DIVISION II CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH WITH THREE-GAME VICTORY OVER 
THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mac Wilson and Ryan Millar weren't about to let a little thing like a 
6-foot-11 middle blocker stop them from their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Millar are the biggest hitters for the Highland High boys' 
volleyball team, and even the presence of Thousand Oaks middle blocker Paul 
Brandt didn't stop the Bulldogs from sweeping the Lancers, 15-12, 15-13, 15-10, 
Wednesday in the semifinals of the Southern Section Division II playoffs at 
Quartz Hill High. 
</P>
<P>
 Millar had a match-high 21 kills and Wilson added 14, including no hitting 
errors in the last two games to give Highland (18-0) its first trip to the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland will play Royal for the title Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland used one of its best weapons, the quick set, to reduce the 
effectiveness of Brandt and 6-7 1/2 Jason Hartman. Most of Millar's kills, 
including 10 in the second game alone, were right down the middle of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last two games, our passing was unstoppable," Millar said. "When our 
passing is unstoppable, we are unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
 Highland was able to counter Brandt with some size of its own. Wilson stands 
6-8 and Millar is 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt had only one clean block and the Lancers were held to six blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem Highland had was sticking to the rules. Setter Toby Sides 
passed the ball well but was penalized several times for lifting the ball 
during the closely called match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got me down and a little frustrated but there's not much I can do," Sides 
said. "I just had to make sure we had to get it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks (16-2) was led by Hartman with 16 kills and three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 All three games were closely contested but the biggest turning point for 
Highland came late in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers had rallied from a 10-7 deficit to a 13-13 tie was on serve.  
</P>
<P>
 After a Bulldog timeout, Hartman uncharacteristically flubbed a serve, then 
hit the next ball wide on a kill attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 After trading sideouts, Millar closed out the game with a kill off a quick set 
for an insurmountable lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the games were close, it was a matter of who wanted it more," Thousand 
Oaks Coach James Park said. "We weren't passing or digging and those little 
things catch up."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kristin Dunn of Cal State Northridge threw a personal best of 174 feet 9 
inches to win the women's javelin in a track and field meet at Long Beach State 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The throw qualified Dunn for the NCAA championships at Boise State on June 
1-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn, a left-handed junior, has been hampered by a knee injury all season, but 
she uncorked a throw of 169-11 in the first round to smash her previous best 
(164-0) and followed her 174-9. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA qualifying standard is 169-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a tremendous performance for her," Northridge Coach Don Strametz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Northridge junior Mike McClintock threw a personal best of 
221-3 in the men's javelin and senior Rich Gitahi ran a personal best of 3 
minutes 51.38 seconds in the 1,500 meters. JOHN ORTEGA

<P>
 Frank Cantu, who was hired earlier this month to succeed Jim Ozella as Alemany 
High baseball coach, has withdrawn from the position and been replaced by 
assistant coach Tim Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany Athletic Director Dudley Rooney said Cantu realized that coaching 
would conflict with his duties as principal at St. Didacus, an elementary 
school in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne, a 10-year assistant under Ozella and a math teacher at Alemany, will 
take over the program next season. 
</P>

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: SURPRISING NEVADA REALLY PACKS A PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of Nevada baseball team probably ranks among the most 
surprising in Division I this season, considering that the Wolf Pack toppled 
the likes of Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton to win the Big West 
Conference championship and gain an NCAA Regional berth for the first time in 
the program's 24-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA pitcher Bobby Kazmirski became a Wolf Pack believer in a brief outing on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys could flat out crush it at times," Kazmirski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-handed reliever from Agoura High was mopping up in a 12-3 loss when 
he hung a slider to Nevada sophomore catcher Shane Slayton from Royal High. 
Slayton hit it 430 feet over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The next batter, Anthony Basoco, was hit in the back with a slider from 
Kazmirski and a bench-clearing brawl followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hitting Basoco) was an accident," Kazmirski said. "If I hit anyone, it would 
have been Slayton, because he stood there and looked at (his home run) for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Slayton: "He was a little cocky. I guess if you hit a ball that far, you 
can watch it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins took two of three games at Nevada (40-13), becoming only the second 
team to win a series this season against the Wolf Pack, ranked 14th by Baseball 
America and Collegiate Baseball magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada is the second-seeded team in the Central Regional at Austin, Tex. Also 
in that regional are Stanford, Texas and top-seeded Oklahoma. Nevada opens 
against Texas San Antonio (39-16) on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton, who carries a .350 batting average, is tied for the team lead in home 
runs (10) and is second in runs batted in (52), walks (34) and slugging 
percentage (.607). He strikes out only once every 10.7 at-bats. Freshman 
infielder Andy Dominique (Alemany) is batting .333, and ranks second in home 
runs (eight) and third in RBIs (49). 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton batted .529 with 11 doubles, eight home runs and 49 RBIs in his senior 
year at Royal and was disappointed when he was not selected in the baseball 
amateur draft. He said that pro scouts were scared off by rumors that he would 
demand a high signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because he had a 2.3 grade-point average at Royal, Nevada was the only 
school to offer him a scholarship. But he has no regrets. He loves Reno, where 
more than 5,000 fans attended the series against UCLA even though the spring 
semester ended two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get great fan support here," he said. "We get a lot of families and little 
kids from the community, even when we're doing bad and it's 45 degrees with the 
wind blowing. The people are nice and the crowds are unbelievable. I sign about 
a hundred balls after each game." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Southern California players play for the Wolf Pack. Among them are 
pitchers Chris Garza (2-0 record, 14 strikeouts in 18 1/3 innings), a freshman 
from Notre Dame; Rico Lagattuta (3-3, tied for the team lead with six saves), a 
sophomore from Westlake, and David Brown (eight hits, 10 RBIs), a freshman 
reserve outfielder from Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Nevada assistant coach John Savage) was recruiting us for two years before 
we got here," Garza said. "He told us it was an up-and-coming program. It's 
worked out really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Garza, before suffering an early-season elbow injury, beat 
then-15th-ranked Stanford in his first college start on March 1. In the 
regional, Nevada could again face Stanford, which features sophomore right 
fielder Brodie Van Wagenen from Crespi (.275 batting average). Garza also will 
be reunited with Oklahoma pitcher Russell Ortiz (28 strikeouts in 32 innings). 
The two were teammates as freshmen at Montclair Prep. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Other Valley players headed to regional play: Junior center fielder Jacob Cruz 
(Channel Islands) has a .407 average, 11 home runs and 58 RBIs for Arizona 
State in the Midwest Regional. USC's J.P. Roberge (St. Francis), a junior first 
baseman, is batting .323 with 41 RBIs and 18 stolen bases and senior Mike 
Mancuso (Chatsworth) starts at catcher. USC will play in the South Regional. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State, which plays in the Midwest II Regional, includes Tim Falsken 
(Westlake), Brian Smith (Agoura/Pierce College), John Swanson (Rio 
Mesa/Oklahoma State), Jeff Ritter (Agoura/Moorpark College), Angel Aragon 
(Channel Islands), Rick Nadeau, Jeff Tagliaferri (Kennedy) and Casey Snow 
(Crespi). . . . Left-handed pitcher Justin Siegel (Taft) plays for North 
Carolina State, which plays in the Mideast Regional.  
</P>
<P>
 In softball, 12 area players -- not including those from Cal State Northridge 
-- are participating in the College World Series. For top-ranked Arizona: Amy 
Chellevold (Thousand Oaks), Jenny Dalton (Glendale), Krista Gomez (Alemany) and 
Nancy Evans (Hoover); for UCLA: Nicole Victoria (Buena) and Jenny Mike (Buena); 
for Fresno State: Kim Maher (Buena), Jenifer Henry (Buena) and Melissa Thatcher 
(Agoura); for Missouri: Keri Borzello (Taft); for Utah: Deb DiMeglio (Palmdale) 
and Cyndee Bennett (Glendale).

 WILD GOOSE CHASE: Today would be the 87th birthday of Newport Beach's most 
famous resident, Marion Michael Morrison. That's the late Oscar winner John 
Wayne, of course. It's also a big day for Ermal Williamson, who works part time 
as a John Wayne look-alike. . . . Not only will Williamson be in costume this 
morning at the Duke's statue at John Wayne Airport, he'll join the crowd in 
Newport Beach who signed up for a private Duke birthday party aboard the Wild 
Goose, formerly the actor's boat.

 ALL-AMERICAN TRAVEL: It pays to complain, sometimes. Cathy Davidson of 
Hillsborough, N.C., was not happy with an American Airlines ticketing agent at 
John Wayne Airport. She thought she was being overcharged on a change in a 
non-refundable ticket. . . . She complained to Conde Nast Traveler magazine's 
ombudsman. The magazine called American on her behalf. Result: A $145 refund. 
The magazine's advice: In all disputes, ask to see a supervisor.

 COSMIC EAGLE: You didn't get in on those pricey tickets for the Eagles reunion

who helped their career take flight in the early '70s. . . . Jack Tempchin, who 
wrote the Eagles hits "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and "Already Gone," leads his 
bluesy band, the Cosmic Ramblers, every Tuesday night at the Marine Room Tavern 
in Laguna Beach -- 8 to midnight, no cover charge. And, yes, he does his Eagles 
songs.

 MERRY ENGLANDER? Local political consultant Harvey Englander has a busy 
campaign season -- he represents both county supervisor candidate Haydee V. 
Tillotson and 70th Assembly District contender Marilyn Brewer. But friends and 
political foes say something big is in the works at Englander's firm. . . . 
Englander acknowledges only that he's been considering a business merger with a 
Washington firm. He's declining further comment, except to say nothing will 
happen before the June 7 election.

 CHINA CARD: The people who do business with China are happy today because 
President Clinton is expected to renew that country's most-favored-nation trade 
status (A1). Few, in fact, could be happier than Robert Solomon, head of Dakin 
Inc. in Woodland Hills. Half of his company's stuffed animals and toys are made 
in China. . . . "I would have had to scurry to double manufacturing in other 
countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 SMOKE RULES: It looks as though smokers in Santa Clarita won't get burned 
quite as badly as they originally feared. That's because the City Council has 
passed the first reading of an ordinance that would ban smoking in enclosed 
workplaces but permit it in some restaurants and bars (B8). . . . The new 
guidelines would prohibit cigarette vending machines as well. 
</P>
<P>
 SALVATION: Gary Torgeson proves you do get second chances in life. His first 
coaching attempt at Cal State Northridge was in football, and it was a huge 
failure. He was fired after three seasons. . . . But Torgeson (above) was hired 
13 years ago as CSUN's softball coach and became a big winner. His team plays 
today in the first round of the College Softball World Series (C12). 
</P>
<P>
 INSPIRATION: The softball team's march to the World Series also means a lot 
for school pride. This is a campus that, only four months ago, took quite a 
beating from the quake. In fact, you can't avoid the daily reminders. . . . 
"Their field is surrounded by trailers, almost up against the outfield fence," 
said Ron Kopita, a CSUN vice president, "and yet the team pulled together." 
</P>
<P>
 ART IMITATES LIFE: Write about what you know, everyone told Jeff Seymour. No 
thanks, he told them. But when Seymour, who ran the former Gnu Theatre in North 
Hollywood from 1984 to 1993, found other projects too costly, he turned to his 
own life, and, presto, he made his first movie, "Rave Review." . . . Made for 
under $1 million, the movie, which stars Ed Begley Jr., may hit theaters this 
fall. Michael Arkush

ballot. And its proposals to ban illegal immigrants from public hospitals and 
schools promises to intensify California's contentious debate over immigration. 
. . . Tonight at 6:30, author-social commentator Ruben Martinez lectures on 
"Xenophobia and the New Immigration Debate" at Oxnard's Heritage Square 
Hall."Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall," asks Martinez, "are we on 
the verge or erecting a similar wall on our southern border?"

 LETTUCE REJOICE: In some not-so-sour news, a bountiful crop of lemons helped 
turn around agricultural sales last year (B1). . . . Lemons remain the top crop 
in the county. But celery, which has stalked strawberries in recent years, 
plowed ahead to become the county's No. 2 farm commodity. Avocados produced a 
fat crop of 62,600 tons, yet remain behind berries and nursery plants in total 
sales. Farmers attributed the year's hefty harvest to better weather and 
healthy vegetable markets.

 HOOK OR SINKER? Ventura city officials understand the allure of oceanfront 
restaurants. They appreciate how the peaceful ocean and island views lend a 
special dimension to the dining experience. . . . So the officials are 
frustrated that few restaurateurs have jumped at the chance to build an eatery 
on the refurbished Ventura Pier (Ventura County Life, Page 8). After all, it's 
the only free-standing beachfront property available.

 CAPS AND GOWNS: More than 200 Cal State Northridge students graduate in 
Ventura today, taking some small steps for their degrees. But the procession 
symbolizes big strides toward Ventura County's own four-year university (B5). . 
. . The satellite campus had enough graduates this year to warrant graduation 
ceremonies in Ventura. "It's a very visual and meaningful ceremony," campus 
director Joyce Kennedy said. "And it shows that we really are moving toward 
that four-year university."

 Government and Serbian forces pounded each other Wednesday in northern Bosnia, 
frustrating efforts by international negotiators to revive stalled peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Muslim troops were shelling Serbian 
positions around Tesanj, 60 miles northwest of Sarajevo. Tesanj and nearby 
Maglaj have been surrounded and cut off by besieging Serbs for much of the 
2-year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government radio accused Serbs of shelling three towns north of 
Sarajevo and said one person was killed in shelling of Bihac in northwest 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting did not bode well for efforts by U.S., Russian and European 
envoys to revive peace talks. The envoys met separately with factional leaders 
at a mountain resort in France.

 Israel on Wednesday freed two West Bank Palestinians jailed for nearly the 
entire 27 years of Israeli occupation, Palestinians said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Palestinians turned out in the city of Nablus to welcome Taj Deen 
Husseini, 55, and Issa Qaisi, 68. Both had been serving life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were among the first guerrillas of Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement to be arrested after Israel captured 
the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 Qaisi was convicted of killing a Palestinian suspected of serving as an 
informer for Israel. Husseini was convicted of illegal possession of weapons.

<P>
 A homicide victim found slain in a wheat field 55 miles northeast of San 
Francisco has been identified as a French tourist, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members identified the body of Joel Bouyenval, a 45-year-old French 
citizen, at the Solano County coroner's office Tuesday, according to the 
Sheriffs' Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouyenval arrived at San Francisco International Airport around April 19, 
police said. He was last seen in the Lake Tahoe area, after touring San 
Francisco in a rented car with a companion. 
</P>
<P>
 The companion returned to France and reported Bouyenval missing to family 
members. The family contacted the French Consulate, which contacted the Missing 
Persons Bureau of the San Francisco Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were able to match Bouyenval's physical characteristics with the corpse 
through a national missing persons system. 
</P>
<P>
 Solano County sheriff's detectives found the body April 21. Authorities 
believe the motive behind the attack was robbery. An investigation is in 
progress.

TENNESSEE PAROLE BOARD REJECTS RAY'S BID IN KING ASSASSINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Earl Ray lost his bid for freedom Wednesday when a parole board rejected 
claims that he did not kill Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and that he was 
pressured into pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 At his first parole hearing in 25 years, Ray claimed his lawyer convinced him 
that he already had been convicted by the news media and that pleading guilty 
in return for 99 years in prison was better than risking a trial and possible 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I didn't kill Dr. King," Ray said. "I wasn't involved in any type of 
collusive activity." 
</P>
<P>
 King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, as he stood on a motel balcony in 
Memphis, where he had come to support a strike by sanitation workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a choice," Tennessee Board of Paroles member Rose Hill said. "I did 
not have a choice," Ray replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 3 to 0 against parole. Ray, 66, needed four votes. One of the 
seven board members investigated King's assassination and disqualified himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining three decided not to vote when it became clear that Ray had lost 
his bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Two board members said they would consider parole in June, 1999, once Ray has 
served one-third of his sentence. "That is full service for the crime you 
committed," board Chairman Charles Traughber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's parole hearing dealt with Ray's record as a prisoner, which 
included a 54-hour escape in 1977 and a 1981 attack in which he was stabbed 22 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was separate from Ray's legal efforts to win a trial in Memphis, 
where a judge last week gave permission to test-fire the rifle believed to have 
been used in King's assassination. Previous ballistics tests were ruled 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 King's slaying sparked riots in more than 100 cities and set off one of the 
largest searches in U.S. history before Ray was captured in London. Ray was 
returned to Memphis, where he pleaded guilty to murder. Three days later, he 
recanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in 1978 that there had 
been a conspiracy to kill King. The panel said that Ray shot King but that a 
St. Louis-based conspiracy of racists was behind the slaying.

OIL FIRM SEEKS PUBLIC AGENCY DISPATCH FILES IN SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Threatened with legal action from Ventura County, attorneys for the company 
that spilled 84,000 gallons of heavy crude into McGrath Lake have requested 
dispatch records from police and fire crews that were slow to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter received this week, Mark R. Pachowicz, a former prosecutor who now 
works for a private law firm, seeks "any and all Oxnard Police Department 
dispatch logs which pertain to or involve the release of oil at issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The request on behalf of Bush Oil comes the same week that county supervisors 
declined to pursue a federal grant to fund an inventory of the area's 
underground oil and gas pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other significant pipeline-related leaks have blackened Ventura County 
canyons and waterways since the McGrath Lake spill near Oxnard, a fact that 
prompted supervisors to consider mapping underground pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 No such maps now exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter to the city of Oxnard also asks for copies of all fire logs, tapes 
of communications between the city and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, 
and any written police correspondence about the oil spill, which soiled miles 
of beaches and killed hundreds of migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Assistant City Atty. Paula Kimbrell said the request, addressed to City 
Clerk Daniel Martinez, with copies sent to the city attorney and the police and 
fire chiefs, would be complied with as soon as feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter comes as investigators wind down their probe of Bush Oil and Berry 
Petroleum, its Taft-based parent company. Criminal charges in the case could be 
filed within weeks, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An underground pipe operated by Bush Oil near Harbor Boulevard and Gonzales 
Road leaked for at least three days before federal officials patrolling 
offshore rigs noticed an oily sheen on the ocean Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, more than 2,000 barrels of thick black crude had spilled from the 
ruptured pipeline, which Bush officials said transported no more than 600 
barrels of crude a day. A barrel contains 42 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Records Act request is an apparent attempt to limit the 
responsibility of Bush Oil, since at least six emergency response agencies, 
including Oxnard police and fire crews, ignored early reports of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 One state park ranger alerted by campers the day before Christmas about oil 
leaking into McGrath Lake was subsequently disciplined for failing to follow up 
on that sighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Christmas Eve morning report from a Ventura electrician to the Channel 
Islands Harbor Patrol was referred to Oxnard police and fire dispatchers 
without further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pachowicz said Wednesday that he does not know what information may be on the 
dispatch logs he requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether it's going to hurt or help our case," he said. "I don't 
know what's in them. This is merely a request that we be provided the 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Hatch, a Berry executive who has served as the firm's spokesman, would 
not discuss the case Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Special prosecutor Glen M. Reiser, the Oxnard attorney retained by the 
district attorney to handle the case, said Wednesday that criminal charges 
could be filed against the oil company within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reiser downplayed the impact that the requested information would have on 
the oil company's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "How quickly government agencies reacted to the spill is meaningful from a 
public service standpoint, but it doesn't relate to Berry's responsibility," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser said criminal charges could result in state prison for Berry executives 
if it can be proved that the oil company knew or should have known that it was 
responsible for allowing crude into marine waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal case could be filed either as a felony or misdemeanor, Reiser 
said, although even the lesser charge could mean County Jail time and a fine of 
$500,000 for each day that Bush is found liable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office is putting together a potential civil 
case, which must prove specific environmental damages. State inspectors are now 
assessing the immediate and long-term effects of the spill, Reiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you can't make a decision overnight as to what the environmental 
impact -- both chemically and geologically -- has been to the area," the 
special prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game and other wildlife experts estimated shortly after the 
spill that it would take years, perhaps decades, for McGrath Lake to fully 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday not to 
apply for a federal grant to map the lattice-work of underground oil and gas 
pipes in the county and to assess the risk of future pipeline failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors said they did not want to duplicate the efforts of Assemblyman 
Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), who has introduced a bill that would require 
mapping of most of the buried oil and natural gas pipes in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on that bill -- AB 3261 -- is scheduled June 1 before the Assembly 
Ways and Means committee, said Gavin Payne, O'Connell's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members also said they are less concerned now about the risk of 
future pipeline breaks than they were immediately after the four winter spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a much better state of affairs than we initially thought," said 
Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, who represents the McGrath Lake area. "There were 
several leaks in a row and that led us to worry. But when we took a harder look 
at it . . . everybody's comfort level went up." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn went even further, saying he opposes O'Connell's 
efforts to map underground pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil companies pretty much know where those lines are," he said. "I don't 
want to see the state come down with all kinds of regulations that aren't going 
to produce anything but a huge bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists Wednesday criticized the board's decision, saying local 
officials should not rely on the state to define the extent of future problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The least we could do is map the pipelines," said Cynthia Leake, vice 
president of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Baggerly, an Ojai Valley environmentalist, said supervisors apparently 
bowed to pressure from local oil interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like they're courting the oil industry," she said. "But they can 
court the oil industry and still know where all the pipelines are."

AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION JUMPS 17% IN '93; FARMING: SOARING SALES HELP BOOST THE 
COUNTY'S ECONOMY. LEMONS, CELERY AND STRAWBERRIES WERE THE TOP CROPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's agricultural production rose dramatically in value last year 
-- a rebound that coincides with signs of recovery elsewhere in the regional 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Crop sales hit $848 million in 1993, soaring after an abysmal, rain-battered 
harvest the previous year. Buoyed by strong celery prices and a healthy avocado 
market, the county's overall crop value jumped 17%, according to an annual 
report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher farm earnings also boosted a bevy of related businesses, helping 
soil analysts, irrigation consultants, seed salesmen and produce truckers, 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The encouraging report, issued by county Agricultural Commissioner Earl 
McPhail, comes just as Ventura County's overall economy shows hints of shaking 
off a prolonged slump. Housing sales are climbing, office buildings are filling 
and more county residents are finding work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one segment of the economy does better, we all do better," said Marc 
Charney, president of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. "You 
certainly get a ripple effect, because those who earn more money spend more." 
</P>
<P>
 Surging crop values, Charney said, can help the whole region because 
"agriculture is still among our most important industries." 
</P>
<P>
 From avocados to Valencia oranges, most of the county's big crops found 
healthy markets last year. For the first time in years, celery edged out 
strawberries as Ventura County's No. 2 revenue producer, after lemons. 
</P>
<P>
 And some niche crops, such as kale and cilantro, brought in unusually high 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The abstract numbers mean little to most Ventura County residents, who see 
tractors rumbling through fields and pickers bending over rows regardless of a 
given crop's sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But economists and farmers argue that in the long run, county crop values 
matter a great deal. Every dollar generated by produce, flower or livestock 
sales corresponds to three dollars spent on agricultural-related industries, 
from pesticides to cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 So when crop sales sag, the whole economy lurches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard-based irrigation firm Coastal Pipco, for example, Leonard Kaufmann 
watched his business drop by 20% in the past few years. He attributes the loss, 
in part, to the tumbling crop prices in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when agricultural earnings perked up last year, Coastal Pipco's business 
still staggered, as farmers seemed reluctant to spend money on equipment. But 
now that growers have seen a full year of higher prices, Kaufmann's sales are 
edging up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's an actual increase in (farmers') revenue over previous years, that 
will show up in their willingness to spend money on maintenance and on 
upgrading equipment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that ripple effect, "people in this county should be very concerned 
about what happens to agriculture," said Doug Lowthorp, a sales representative 
for vegetable powerhouse Deardorff-Jackson Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at business's track records, the agricultural industry has 
basically carried the Ventura County economy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, agriculture remains the county's fifth-largest employer, after broadly 
defined industries such as services, retail trade and durable manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a jump in the cash value of local crops "is certainly very good news for 
the rest of the economy, no doubt about it," said economics professor Jamshid 
Damooei of Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But growers cautioned that the impressive hike in crop value does not 
necessarily reflect hefty profits. The figures released by the agricultural 
commissioner deal strictly with gross sales and do not consider farmers' costs 
or per-acre revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we earned $848 million, we probably spent $900 million" to plant, pick and 
package the crops, said David Clarke, who manages some of Boskovitch Farm's 
vast vegetable fields. 
</P>
<P>
 And because of farming's roller-coaster nature, "if we did make any money last 
year, we're losing it all this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, vegetable ranchers predicted a drop in crop value when the 1994 
harvests are tallied next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Good weather statewide has yielded bumper crops of celery, broccoli and other 
commodities -- and the vegetable glut has pushed prices way down. And though 
celery brought in up to $10 a box last year, growers this year can barely 
recoup their picking and packing costs of $3 a box. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berries were just so-so this year," said rancher Scott Deardorff, an owner of 
Deardorff-Jackson, "and all vegetable crops were really, really bad." County's

CITIES PUSH FOR END TO JAIL BOOKING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to unload a $3-million debt, politicians from every Ventura County city 
are pressing the Board of Supervisors to stop billing them for the cost of 
booking inmates into jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of charging cities, local leaders say, the supervisors should dip into 
Proposition 172 half-cent sales tax revenues, which have been set aside to meet 
public safety needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton first urged this approach in December, arguing 
that the county should assume responsibility for the booking fees of $120 per 
inmate. By covering the costs with sales-tax money, he said, supervisors would 
free up funds for cities to hire more police or buy new patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a five-page response detailing the county's fiscal crunch, Supervisor Susan 
K. Lacey rejected Stratton's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Simi Valley mayor won't drop the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time around, he is backed by council members from the nine other 
Ventura County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from each city this week agreed to sign a letter pleading for 
relief from the booking fees. The lineup of 10 signatures, Stratton said, 
should signal the "political weight" backing his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, the council members' tenacity earned some praise from Supervisor 
John K. Flynn, who suggested that his colleagues consider reopening discussions 
with city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to break down some of the animosity that exists between cities and 
the county," Flynn said. "And if we can buy some (goodwill) by knocking down 
the fees, we ought to take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since supervisors imposed the charges three years ago, to make up for state 
funding cuts, city officials have refused to pay a nickel. The bills keep 
accumulating, though -- and so far, the cities have racked up a $3-million debt 
for suspects arrested in their jurisdictions and processed at the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have been powerless to collect because they must await the 
outcome of a lawsuit that city leaders have filed to protest the booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has already ruled that counties have the power to bill 
cities for the cost of fingerprinting and photographing inmates, but several 
other aspects of the case are still pending, according to Assistant County 
Counsel Noel Klebaum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Stratton hopes the cities' collective appeal will prompt the 
supervisors to reconsider use of the Proposition 172 funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have already allocated $24 million to law enforcement, 
including the new Todd Road jail and the district attorney's office. And 
they've hinted at plans to give an undetermined sum to the County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But city leaders suspect the supervisors can find enough left over to cover 
the jail booking costs. Such a move would wipe out substantial city debt and 
give local politicians more law-enforcement money to play with. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, for example, would save up to $100,000 a year -- "enough to buy 
another police officer or two," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thousand Oaks would reap an even bigger windfall. Eliminating existing 
debt would free up $400,000 that the city now holds in reserve in case the 
court orders payment of back bills, City Councilman Frank Schillo said. "That 
money could be used for law enforcement locally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for bigger police budgets sounded alluring to Sheriff's Cmdr. 
Kathy Kemp, who heads the Thousand Oaks force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the city of Thousand Oaks could use more officers so we can remain 
a proactive police force," Kemp said. "It would be very beneficial to me if the 
city and county could work this out in that manner." 
</P>
<P>
 But agreement remains a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said she could not support eliminating the booking 
fees, since the money is supposed to help the county recover from state raids 
on law-enforcement coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand their frustration, I really do," VanderKolk said. "But we've got 
responsibilities to take care of, and we've sustained a lot worse cuts than 
they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the county's budget crunch, Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose said he 
wasn't optimistic about an agreement. "I don't have a lot of hopes," Gose said. 
"But we know we won't get anything if we don't try."

PLAN TO HALT TRAIN UPSETS COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allan Prevette shook his head in dismay Wednesday as he walked to the vacant 
railway platform in Oxnard, where at precisely 5:31 a.m., a sleek 
periwinkle-and-white Metrolink train would carry him off to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54-year-old Oxnard resident, who manages a Woodland Hills aerospace firm, 
couldn't understand why the Oxnard City Council would oppose extending the 
commuter train service, which has eased his 50-minute commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's foolish to give it up now," Prevette said. "I'm a little 
dismayed that that's their position." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the City Council is successful in its opposition to the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission's decision to extend Metrolink service to Oxnard, 
Prevette's comfortable train commute could come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the commission approved a tentative funding plan that 
calls for borrowing $1.6 million from a reserve fund to pay for Metrolink 
service next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard city officials fear that after July, 1995, part of the cost to 
extend the train service will shift to the city, costing Oxnard about $540,000 
a year and depleting state funds that the city has traditionally used for bus 
service and road maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to meet next week with commission members to discuss 
alternative funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have ridden Metrolink; it's very smooth, a class act," said Rita Johnson, 
Oxnard's senior transportation planner. "But the problem is we have limited 
transit funding. . . . I just don't see how we can afford this." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard-area commuters who have adapted to using the twice-a-day trains say it 
would be a mistake to eliminate the Metrolink stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an important service to continue," said Bob Kurtzweil, who has 
been taking the 6:21 a.m. train from Oxnard to Chatsworth since April 4. "It 
provides a lot of relaxation and it's also faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Prevette, who has used Metrolink since it became available as a transportation 
alternative after the Jan. 17 earthquake, said train service to the San 
Fernando Valley and downtown Los Angeles will benefit Ventura County in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are growing out this way," he said. "It's only a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the extension contend that there aren't enough people using 
Metrolink to warrant its continued service to the western part of county. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Metrolink, an average of 59 round-trip riders commuted to the Los 
Angeles area from Oxnard in April, a number that the commission determined was 
sufficient to warrant the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 But standing in the pre-dawn drizzle Wednesday morning at the empty Oxnard 
railway platform, first-time Metrolink rider Patricia Gamoning gazed at the 
deserted parking lot and wondered where the other commuters were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that people would start coming within 10 minutes of the train, then 
five minutes of the train, and then I realized they weren't coming," the Port 
Hueneme resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the commuter train pulled into the station at 5:31 a.m., Gamoning was 
one of less than 10 riders to board. About three dozen people boarded the 6:21 
a.m. train Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills resident Ray Gross, who is living in Oxnard while his 
earthquake-damaged home is being rebuilt, said the numbers are low because not 
enough people know about the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're getting their full share of riders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the few dozen riders who do take the train, some said they would be willing 
to pay more to continue Metrolink service to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders traveling from Oxnard to Chatsworth now pay $5.50 for a one-way trip 
and $45 for a book of 10 one-way trips. The fares are expected to increase in 
July, a Metrolink spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson said subsidizing fares would not be a cost-effective solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their hearts are in the right place," she said of the riders. "(But) we have 
to put the money where everyone can best be served."

CAMARILLO FEARS CLASH IN DUAL DUTIES OF CONSULTANT; GOVERNMENT: A MAN HIRED TO 
LURE CORPORATIONS TO THE CITY HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY HIRED BY VENTURA. HE SAYS 
THE ASSIGNMENTS ARE DIFFERENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A city consultant in Camarillo tentatively hired as an economic adviser for 
Ventura has a conflict of interest that most likely will prevent him from 
keeping both jobs, Camarillo officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials on Monday tentatively selected Thomas E. Flavin, 47, to help 
draw up a blueprint for that city's economic revitalization, even though Flavin 
is leading Camarillo's efforts to lure corporations to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials said the hiring of Flavin was done with the understanding 
that he would quit his job with Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far as I'm concerned, he's disqualified himself if he doesn't (quit his 
Camarillo job)," said Ventura City Councilman Jim Monahan. "I don't think you 
can serve two masters." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle said Flavin told council members he would be 
willing to quit his Camarillo job if he was appointed to the Ventura post. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was willing to quit that job," Tuttle said. "We want (him) putting 
(his) time and effort into one job. Plus, it's pretty hard to promote one thing 
over another, which is what he would be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Flavin, a former Burbank city councilman who is president of his own 
consulting firm, said that because the assignments for the cities are 
different, he hopes to be able to do both jobs at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Camarillo hired Flavin last fall to work 25 hours a month at a 
monthly salary of $2,500. Earlier this year, the City Council extended his 
contract until December. 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin said the six-month, full-time Ventura post will require him to 
formulate a strategy and planning document for the city and will not involve 
any corporate recruiting. Flavin is seeking a $6,000-a-month salary in ongoing 
negotiations with Ventura officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two jobs are really fundamentally different," Flavin said. "I understand 
that there may be some concerns and I appreciate those concerns. But the facts 
are that these two jobs are not the same and that I feel I can do them both 
well without any conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin said he informed Camarillo City Manager Bill Little in March of his 
application for the job in Ventura and spoke to him again two weeks ago when he 
was called in for a finalist interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done nothing behind anyone's back here," Flavin said. "I'm just a 
business person and I've got to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Little confirmed that Flavin kept him informed of his dealings with Ventura, 
adding that until he can review Flavin's contract with Camarillo, the city 
would hold off on deciding if it will ask the consultant to relinquish his 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom has been upfront with me on this all the way through," Little said. 
"Until I can see the contract, I won't know if it's a conflict of interest or 
one of time." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some Camarillo City Council members said Wednesday that the Ventura 
job represents a potential conflict for Flavin and that he would have to choose 
between the two jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems like a very serious conflict of interest to me," said Camarillo 
Mayor Ken Gose. "If he wants to continue to work for us, he will have to make a 
decision. I know that our contract with him talks about him not doing the same 
sort of work for any other city." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Davis Smith echoed Gose's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had an agreement," Smith said. "I don't believe he can work for 
both cities. But I consider it a part of the competitive process. It's a little 
ironic that the guy we hired to lure away businesses to our city was himself 
lured away." 
</P>
<P>
 In a March report to Camarillo officials, Flavin said he had talked to 76 
firms throughout Southern California and, of those, eight had expressed serious 
interest in relocating to Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin said Wednesday that two firms had become very interested in moving to 
the city, but that talks were still ongoing. Flavin would not disclose the 
names of the firms.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COPTER BLAZE BLAMED ON FIRE-STARTER DEVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal report released Wednesday confirms that a machine dispensing 
incendiary devices sparked a fire that destroyed a Ventura County sheriff's 
helicopter a year ago, but the report does not assign blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board report does, however, raise questions 
about training programs for the sheriff's aviation unit. A final report further 
detailing the cause of the accident will be released in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's $1.1-million helicopter went up in flames last June after being 
used to help start a controlled burn aimed at clearing 500 acres of brush in 
Cheeseboro Canyon near the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The report from the National Transportation Safety Board said the sheriff's 
deputy assigned to operate an aerial ignition device aboard the copter had 
reloaded it with flammable balls and turned the operating switch on just before 
flames broke out beneath the belly of the Bell 206L-3 helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The report notes that the overall power source for the ignition device was 
controlled by pilot Chris Spangenberg. Spangenberg told investigators he had 
not known that crew chief Jeff Lawrence had reloaded the device. 
</P>
<P>
 While the report fails to address the issue, Spangenberg said in an interview 
that he did not push the button that controls the device after flying out of 
the 500-acre burn area. 
</P>
<P>
 While not assigning blame, the report notes neither Lawrence nor Spangenberg 
had used the incendiary device in flight before the day of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department does not have a formal program to train deputies on 
use of the device, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence's training consisted of four to six hours of instruction in 1991, an 
observation flight in 1992 and a review the day before the June 30, 1993, 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 A training manual developed by the U.S. Forest Service recommends six to eight 
hours of training on the device, in-flight operation of the unit and a written 
test, according to the NTSB report. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Earl Matthews of the sheriff's aviation unit said future classes on use 
of the ignition device will be taught by Forest Service instructors. He said 
the unit has always been safety-conscious, but did not keep detailed records on 
training and did not have a formal training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've needed it for a long time and this has been the impetus that's gotten 
us moving," he said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: $2.8 MILLION IN QUAKE GRANTS ALLOCATED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors has allocated $2.8 million in federal 
earthquake recovery grants, and nearly all the money was earmarked for the 
hard-hit areas of Fillmore and Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the extent of the damage, . . . the funding requests far outweighed 
the funds," Deputy Chief Administrative Officer Marty Robinson wrote in a memo 
to the board, which voted Tuesday."The recommended projects are those which are 
urgently needed to provide housing and commercial rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest grant, $575,000, will go to the city of Fillmore for materials to 
rebuild homes. Two-thirds of the grant will be spent in Fillmore and one-third 
in Piru. The county will spend another $200,000 to rebuild dwellings in those 
two communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., the county's largest builder of low-cost 
housing, will get $400,000 to build 30 three- and four-bedroom rental houses 
for the very poor in Fillmore. Residents of that city will get first crack at 
the rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $90,000 will go to low-income housing developer Affordable Communities 
to pay pre-construction costs at a 100-unit Piru subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Fillmore will get another $471,000 to begin to rebuild its 
shattered downtown and to pay for the temporary shelters where displaced 
shopkeepers moved after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Piru's commercial district will receive about $170,000, most of it to rebuild 
eight shops and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $50,000 will go to Moorpark to help repair two damaged businesses, and 
$21,000 and $20,000 will be forwarded to Oxnard and Ventura, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining $480,000 will be spent by Ventura County to repair Fillmore's 
reservoirs and on a variety of other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley manages its own federal Community Development Block Grant program 
and previously received $5.5 million in quake recovery grants. DARYL KELLEY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CITY DELEGATES TO JOIN AIR POLLUTION BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City and county officials have acted to give Ventura County cities an equal 
voice on the powerful board that sets and enforces air pollution regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Five city representatives will be added to the county's five-person Air 
Pollution Control District board under an agreement ratified Tuesday by the 
county Board of Supervisors and the Assn. of Ventura County Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is really a smart thing to do," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton 
said. "The cities, which in most cases feel the real impacts of air quality 
regulations, have not had a say." 
</P>
<P>
 The equal city and county representation is required by a state law approved 
last year after strong lobbying by California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan Lacey said the committee that drafted the changes agreed on 
all key provisions, although several city officials did initially push for a 
board with members from all 10 local cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconstituted Ventura County board must be seated by July 1. Stratton said 
the cities' association is expected to meet in mid-June to choose its five 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The air pollution board is under court order to clean the county's air by 
2005. It has passed measures that have been costly to businesses, and more are 
contemplated. Ventura County remains one of the nation's worst areas for ozone 
pollution, despite marked improvement in recent years. DARYL KELLEY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TEAMSTER CANDIDATE CAN VISIT WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to an intimidation complaint, the National Labor Relations Board has 
ordered the Teamsters Union local in Ventura to notify a former top official 
that he can visit workers on the job without fear of being physically removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new labor board ruling directs Teamster Local 186 to notify its former 
secretary-treasurer, Martin Fry, that he will not be ejected from work sites 
for advocating union policy changes or promoting his candidacy for union 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Those activities are within Fry's rights under federal labor law, the labor 
board ruled last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The NLRB upheld the ruling of an administrative law judge who found that the 
local's business agent, Lyle Barnett, threatened Fry with physical removal from 
work sites at a meeting in 1992. At that same meeting, the local's top 
official, Secretary-Treasurer Dennis Shaw, authorized Barnett to carry through 
on the threats, according to the administrative judge. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement posted this week by Local 186, which represents about 2,000 
workers in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We will advise Martin Fry, in writing, that we will not threaten him with 
physical retaliation or physically retaliate against him for visiting job sites 
. . . to solicit other members/employees to support changes in the local's 
policies and practices or to support his campaign for the office of 
secretary-treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, of Oak View, and Fry, of Ojai, union allies in the 1980s, have been 
rivals for the local's $52,000-a-year top job for several years. Fry has filed 
complaints about the union's operations under Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, the U.S. Department of Labor filed suit to void the local's 
election of six top officials in 1993, charging that dozens of eligible voters 
were not properly notified.

<P>
 Authorities on Wednesday continued to search for a 27-year-old man who 
wandered away from Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Tipton is deaf, developmentally disabled and cannot communicate, said 
Myron Dimmett, spokesman for Camarillo State Hospital.Hospital officials say he 
is not considered a threat to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members discovered Tipton missing about 8 p.m. Sunday, Dimmett said. He 
had been playing baseball with several other patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure how he got out," Dimmett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipton escaped once a few years ago, but was found quickly, Dimmett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Search and Rescue Team and hospital staff members 
searched unsuccessfully for Tipton along Potrero Road and Las Posas Road on 
Wednesday, Dimmett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipton was last seen wearing a gray sweat shirt and gray pants. He is 5-foot-5 
and weighs about 155 pounds. He has brown hair and brown eyes. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK VIEW; NOT-GUILTY PLEA GIVEN IN FINGER-BITING 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oak View doctor has been accused of biting off his neighbor's finger during 
a dispute over a water drain and appeared Wednesday in Ventura County Municipal 
Court, where he pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Wadsworth has been charged with one count of felony mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 His neighbor, Milan Dvoran, told authorities that Wadsworth bit off his left 
pinky between the first and second knuckle on March 1 and the remainder of it 
had to be amputated, according to a Ventura County sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Dvoran filed a lawsuit in Ventura County Superior Court against Wadsworth, 62. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit -- which includes allegations of negligence and assault and battery 
-- seeks $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Wadsworth nor his attorney, Kelton Gibson, could be reached for 
comment. Dvoran was also unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records list Wadsworth as living on Valley Meadow Court. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit and criminal court documents, Wadsworth and Dvoran 
were involved in a legal dispute regarding water run-off and an easement. 
Dvoran plugged a drain line that Wadsworth had put on his property, the records 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadsworth removed the plug and kept it, the records say. On March 1, a fight 
erupted between Dvoran and Wadsworth over the plug. During the altercation, 
Dvoran tried to push Wadsworth's face away from his own face with his hands, 
documents say. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when a portion of the finger was bitten off, the records say. The 
finger had to be amputated below the second knuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department report asking the court to order Wadsworth to stay away 
from the victim criticized the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "In talking with other neighbors, we learned that Wadsworth continually 
terrorizes everyone in the neighborhood, and they all (avoid) him out of fear 
of what he may do," said the report filed in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadsworth is free on $5,000 bail. The criminal case has been assigned to 
Superior Court Judge Allan Steele. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 4 GUARDS SUE COUNTY CORRECTIONS AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four current and former Ventura County Corrections Services Agency guards sued 
the agency Tuesday, claiming wrongful discipline, wrongful termination and 
racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the plaintiffs have been fired by the agency for alleged wrongdoing 
in recent years.Two of them won their jobs back on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections Services Deputy Director Calvin Remington denied the allegations 
in the lawsuit, filed in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have policies and procedures in place to ensure that discrimination does 
not occur," he said. "The previous disciplinary actions taken against these 
employees were appropriate." Three of the plaintiffs are African Americans and 
one is Polynesian. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Talili, employed at the agency since 1989, was fired in July, 1992, 
after being falsely accused of assaulting a minor at Juvenile Hall, the lawsuit 
says. He was put back to work by the Ventura County Civil Service Commission in 
February, 1993, the suit says, but reassigned to a "less desirable" position. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Hughes, an employee at the agency since 1983, makes the same general 
allegations as Talili in the lawsuit. He was also fired in July, 1992, in 
connection with the incident involving the minor, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 John DuBose, employed at the agency since 1989, received a two-day suspension 
after a minor escaped from Juvenile Hall in March, 1992. The next month he was 
accused of leaving his post and later fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl S. Dixon, employed at the agency since 1981, was the target of 
discrimination and harassment after agreeing to cooperate in Talili's appeal, 
the lawsuit charges. Dixon also was the subject of several discipline reports 
-- including one for insubordination and sexual harassment -- and not allowed 
to return to work after a leave of absence for stress, the lawsuit says. DWAYNE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CENTER FOR MENTALLY ILL OKD AS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A downtown Ventura drop-in center for the mentally ill will soon allow 10 
clients to stay overnight under a proposal approved this week by the city's 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this fall, The Turning Point Foundation will clear out one of the 
building's two rooms each night to make way for roll-away beds and 
partitions.Located on Thompson Boulevard near California Street, the foundation 
is now a daytime center where the mentally ill drop in for food, health care 
and companionship. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials agreed to certain conditions before becoming a nighttime 
shelter, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Homeless residents would spend no more than 90 nights in a row at the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least two employees would remain on duty at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lighting would be added to the back of the building to discourage homeless 
people from sleeping there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guests who leave the shelter after 9 p.m. would not be allowed back into the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission approved the shelter 4 to 0 Tuesday night, with 
Commissioner Al Okuma absent and Commissioner Ted Temple abstaining. The 
commission also asked the foundation to meet with Ventura County Superior Court 
Judge William Peck, who owns an apartment building next to the center, and 
address his worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck has complained that the center's guests yell back and forth on the street 
outside his building, and urinate on his property. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BASE COUNCIL TO HOLD 1ST MEETING FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to improve communication between the public and Ventura County's 
two naval installations, the first meeting of the newly formed Ventura County 
Base Community Council will be held Friday at Ventura City Hall, officials 
announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7:30 a.m. meeting will involve Navy officials from the Port Hueneme Naval 
Construction Battalion Center and the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, in 
addition to Ventura County Supervisor Maggie Kildee, Navy spokesman Alan Alpers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said the group was organized by county and municipal leaders and Navy 
officials to improve communications between the two bases and the community as 
Navy officials prepare for the 1995 round of the Base Re-alignment and Closure 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is being formed to diffuse base closure rumors and to provide 
regularly scheduled interaction between the Navy and the community," Alpers 
said. "It's the council's goal to explain the (Base Re-alignment and Closure) 
process and improve communications." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials from both bases said they are furnishing the Department of 
Defense with information about the two facilities -- the first step in the 
biannual process. The next round of closures will be decided by the federally 
appointed BRAC commission in February, 1995, and announced in July, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said Steve Mendonca,) Point Mugu's deputy BRAC program manager, will 
attend the meeting and will present a briefing on the base closure process. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at Ventura City Hall, 501 Poli St., Room 202. The 
public is invited to attend. For more information, call 989-8094. J.E. MITCHELL

EX-SHERIFF'S OFFICIAL UNDER PROBE; CRIME: NORMAN WADE, FIRED TWO YEARS AGO, IS 
BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF $15,000 FROM PROPERTY ROOM HE 
OVERSAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Sheriff's Department official is under investigation in the 
disappearance of up to $15,000 from the property room he oversaw, officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman A. Wade, who was fired two years ago after a job-related arrest, is 
also accused of stealing a gun and a camera from his department and selling 
them at an Oxnard pawn shop, said Chief Deputy Kenneth Kipp. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade was head of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department crime lab until 1992, 
when he was fired after pleading no contest to charges that he stole a license 
plate registration sticker from the property room and falsified registration 
documents for his own car. He was fined $300 and sentenced to two years' 
probation in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials Wednesday had no explanation for how the cash could have 
disappeared, and one source told The Times that the case reveals problems with 
providing adequate security in the property room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We process between 20,000 and 30,000 pieces of evidence through that property 
room annually and when we find something missing we jump on it immediately," 
Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp said the case has prompted the department to try to improve procedures in 
the sheriff's property room "to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we have five or six of these things happen every year or two," 
he said. "This is probably the second or third time in my career that I'm aware 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Wade is accused of taking a .357-magnum pistol out of the gun locker at the 
crime lab in Ventura and pawning it at Get-Mor Loan & Jewelry in Oxnard for 
$125 in May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The handgun had been logged into the gun locker in the sheriff's property room 
after prosecutors in a 1983 court case determined they no longer needed it, 
Kipp said. Lab technicians had access to it for ballistics tests, prosecutors 
could have it brought to court for witness comparisons or it might have been 
slated to be destroyed with other guns that deputies take off the streets each 
year, Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade also allegedly pawned a department-issued, 35-millimeter camera at the 
same shop sometime in 1992 for $100, Kipp said. After he was fired and 
arrested, the department asked him to return the camera. Wade went to the pawn 
shop, bought back the camera and turned it in to his superiors, Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case came to light when a routine audit of the gun locker found the pistol 
was missing. Remembering Wade's court case, detectives checked pawn slips that 
shops around Ventura County register with police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that Wade had pawned the gun, the camera and a variety of his own 
property, including jewelry, Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp could offer no motive for the alleged thefts, although he said there are 
indications Wade had family trouble and possibly financial trouble at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, 49, who now works in Phoenix as a toxicologist for the Maricopa County 
Medical Examiner, turned himself in to investigators Tuesday morning, Kipp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to answer detectives' questions on the advice of his attorney, Kipp 
said. He was charged with grand theft and embezzlement and released on $10,000 
bail just after noon Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He is to be arraigned June 1 in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade and his attorney, Robert I. Schwartz of Ventura, could not be reached 
Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really serious business to the sheriff," said Kipp, recently 
appointed to oversee the lab and other divisions in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a position of trust and the integrity of the agency," he 
said. "This man violated that trust and compromised the integrity of the 
agency."

FORMAL GRADUATION A RITE OF PASSAGE FOR CSUN VENTURA CAMPUS; EDUCATION: MORE 
THAN 200 STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE BACHELOR'S AND GRADUATE DEGREES IN A CEREMONY 
BEFITTING THE INSTITUTION'S GROWTH AND LONGEVITY. 
</P>

<P>
 For the first time in its 20-year history, the Ventura branch of Cal State 
Northridge will hand out degrees in a formal ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 students garbed in traditional black caps and gowns will receive 
bachelor's and graduate degrees on Friday, said campus Director Joyce Kennedy.  
</P>
<P>
 The students will be joined by professors in colorful academic robes in a rite 
that will symbolize the strides the tiny Ventura campus has taken in recent 
years, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very visual and meaningful ceremony," Kennedy said. "And it shows that 
we really are moving toward that four-year university." 
</P>
<P>
 The graduation will take place in the large gymnasium at Ventura College 
beginning at 10 a.m., she said. Cal State Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson 
will preside over the ceremonies and hand out the degrees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To symbolize the formality of the ritual, Wilson will bring with her a 
three-foot ceremonial staff called a mace, Kennedy said. Members of the campus' 
Community Advisory Committee will also be on hand in red robes. 
</P>
<P>
 Live music will accompany the ceremony, and the gymnasium will be decorated 
with fresh flowers, Kennedy said. A college photographer will be on hand to 
record the event and refreshments will be served afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all nervous because it's the first time we've done this," she said. 
"Even getting the names out and printed up in the program has been a colossal 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura campus educators decided to hold commencement ceremonies, instead of 
the usual informal reception, because this year's graduating class is so large, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 215 students from the Alessandro Drive campus will receive degrees in 
subjects ranging from liberal studies to environmental health. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 College staff thought the formal ceremony would help commemorate the campus' 
20th year of existence, she said. A spokesman for Wilson said she agreed that 
it is high time for the Ventura campus to have its own ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ventura campus has reached critical mass in terms of graduates," said 
Bruce Erickson. Wilson "realizes that the commencement exercise is very 
important to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The degree will say 'Northridge,' but in many ways, this is entirely a 
Ventura County effort," he said. "President Wilson is very supportive of 
Ventura becoming a free-standing and independent institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura campus offers classes to students in their junior and senior 
years, as well as an array of courses for those seeking graduate degrees. 
Long-term plans call for the development of an independent California State 
university on a lemon grove west of Camarillo, with the full range of classes 
of a four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 That site was selected in 1991 after a seven-year battle to find a suitable 
location in Ventura County that was acceptable to nearby residents and elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials have yet to purchase the 230-acre site for the Camarillo 
campus because of a dispute with one of the property owners. But the master 
planning of the permanent college has already begun, and university officials 
hope that construction will begin within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The average age of Ventura campus students is 34, higher than that of students 
attending community colleges or other state institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because most students at the Alessandro campus are adults changing 
careers or obtaining their first degree after years of struggle, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's commencement exercise will be especially meaningful to the latter 
group, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see lots of youngsters with stars in their eyes, seeing their moms and 
dads getting their degrees," Kennedy said. "And that will represent a first in 
their family."

STUDENTS IN PILOT PROGRAMS HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF; EDUCATION: THREE INNOVATIVE 
PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO GIVE TEACHERS MORE CREATIVE TIME WITH CLASSES. THOSE 
INVOLVED ARE RESPONDING WELL.

 Citing improvements in attendance, discipline and student performance, 
Thousand Oaks school officials are urging the renewal of three pilot programs 
that restructure the traditional classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators with the Conejo Valley Unified School District also say the 
experiments of Newbury Park High School and Conejo and Meadows elementary 
schools have garnered strong support from teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents have closed ranks with our teachers to build an innovative school 
for the 21st Century," said Meadows School Principal Tim Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the programs will be reviewed by the Conejo Valley school board at a 
meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 While the three pilot programs differ in detail, each is designed to give 
teachers more time with students and more time to present creative lessons. All 
of the changes follow reforms recommended in two state reports issued in 1991 
and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At Newbury Park High School, the traditional six-class-a-day schedule was 
scrapped in favor of three 95-minute periods. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, officials say, students are now more willing to sign up for 
demanding courses. In all, 160 more students took math this year compared to 
last, and a higher number of students enrolled in advanced placement courses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For teachers, the schedule change meant losing a preparation period and taking 
on an extra class. Nevertheless, faculty members recently voted 52 to 6 to 
continue the restructuring another year. In a survey, 79% of teachers agreed or 
agreed strongly that they can now spend more time with individual students and 
73% said they've noticed an improvement in student attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park teachers also reported that with fewer students changing periods 
between classes, the campus seems calmer. Forty-eight percent of teachers said 
they have experienced fewer conflicts with students, while 37% noticed no 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 At Meadows Elementary, a two-class pilot program begun in the fall of 1992 was 
expanded this year to include all of the school's 450 pupils. The program 
emphasizes teamwork among students who are grouped in multi-grade clusters. 
Teachers work in pairs using a central theme to blend lessons in math, science 
and English. 
</P>
<P>
 The school also tossed out traditional report cards with A's, Bs and Cs in 
favor of oversized charts that show a student's progress in different skill 
areas. And instead of parent-teacher conferences that leave the child at home, 
Meadows students demonstrate what they have learned by showing parents 
portfolios of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The point, Stephens said, is to give every student a sense of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a kid gets an F or a D in a traditional setting, the kid doesn't want to 
come to school," he said. "That's when they end up out on Highway 1, 
hitchhiking to Santa Cruz when they should be in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Greg Schwarz said he likes the mixed-grade classrooms and the 
emphasis on group projects. On Tuesday, he spent part of the morning working on 
a popup book to illustrate the science-fiction tale "A Wrinkle in Time." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't find a partner, there's always a lot of people so you can find 
another partner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Ruth Wiksell said students are more enthusiastic about school when a 
theme -- such as space or the rain forest -- is used to tie academic subjects 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so independent, it's amazing," she said. "Their creativity comes out 
beyond what's even expected." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo School's pilot program also mixed students from different grade levels. 
One cluster blended 32 students in kindergarten through the second grade; a 
second class contained 25 students in the second through fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the school board, Conejo Valley Supt. Jerry Gross said parents 
have shown more interest in the class mixing students in the lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, parents of more than 100 students have expressed interest in 
enrolling their students in the pilot program next year. At tonight's meeting, 
Gross will recommend expanding it to include 96 students in three classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although standardized test results are not yet available for students in the 
pilot programs, board member Bill Henry said he will vote to extend all three. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some little speed bumps here and there that need to be taken care of, 
but in general they're moving in a positive direction," he said.

MOTIVES OF 2 KEY OFFICIALS QUESTIONED IN RUSSO CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-aged girl who said she was beaten and forced to live in a racquetball 
court behind her posh Westlake home questioned whether a prosecutor and 
detective investigating the case were really out to help her, the girl's older 
brother testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Russo, 25, said the girl made the statement when he met with her in 
December, seven months after she was taken out of the family's home. The 
meeting was unsupervised and violated a court order, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo said his sister told him that Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona and 
sheriff's investigator Bob LeMay seemed more interested in convicting Charlotte 
and Richard Russo to advance their careers than in helping her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said that sometimes it just feels like Dee Corona and Detective LeMay are 
just looking out for their careers," testified Tony Russo. He said he agreed 
with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you mean when you agreed?" asked Corona, seated next to LeMay at the 
prosecution's table. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were there just to win the case," Russo answered Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Corona and LeMay denied they were looking for promotions from 
their work in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo -- a 50-year-old stockbroker -- pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
child abuse and has served a 30-day jail term. Charlotte Russo faces up to 
three years in state prison if convicted of felony and misdemeanor child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prosecuting Mrs. Russo because she abused her daughter," Corona 
insisted later in an interview. "She beat her. She punched her. She bit her. 
And that's why we are prosecuting her." 
</P>
<P>
 LeMay listened as Corona spoke outside the courtroom. "And I concur," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Russo and his five other siblings have sided with their parents in the 
child abuse case as opposed to supporting their sister, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony Wednesday, Tony Russo said that he was aware his sister was 
being forced to sleep in the racquetball court, but that he did not see it as a 
big problem. All she had to do was follow the family's rules and do her 
schoolwork properly and she would have been welcomed back into the main home, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't seem to bother her, being out there, and it didn't seem to change 
any (of her) manners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he said of the racquetball court living arrangement for the girl: "She 
did it to herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Russo also supported his mother's contention that she did not assault the 
16-year-old girl in the family's garage on May 24, 1993. Two neighbors have 
testified that while taking an evening stroll they saw Charlotte Russo striking 
the girl in the garage as Richard Russo yelled at her at the top of his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors called authorities, leading to the arrests of the Russos. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony Russo said he saw the incident and that his mother only nudged the 
girl.  
</P>
<P>
 In general, Russo said his sister often would lie. He acknowledged that in a 
letter to his father's probation officer he once wrote that lying is "an 
addiction" for his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was unaware that he was breaking a court order when he twice 
visited his sister in December while she was in foster care. Russo family 
members are only allowed supervised visits with the girl, but Tony Russo said 
he did not get permission for his visits. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during one early December visit in which he and his sister went out for 
pizza that the girl questioned the motives of the prosecutor and the sheriff's 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, in its fifth week, will resume Tuesday. It is expected to go to the 
jury for a decision by next Thursday, Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell 
Jr. told jurors.

4.5-MAGNITUDE QUAKE GIVES REGION'S RESIDENTS A JARRING WAKE-UP CALL; 
AFTERSHOCK: THE TEMBLOR, CENTERED NEAR THE CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, IS THE LARGEST 
TO STRIKE IN TWO MONTHS. IT WAS PARTICULARLY FELT IN EASTERN VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
 Residents of Ventura and Los Angeles counties got a jarring wake-up call 
Wednesday morning when the largest aftershock to the Northridge earthquake in 
two months rattled the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the short 4.5-magnitude shaker was only powerful enough to break a 
few dishes and rattle some nerves, for many, it was a grim reminder of the 
destructive pre-dawn Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it really good," said Malti Kasondra, 42, of Simi Valley, who was 
jolted awake and started running for the door. "I have a big house -- by the 
time I reached the door, it had stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasondra, who owns a 7-Eleven store in Simi Valley, said she immediately 
called the store to check on her employees. "Only a few lightweight items fell 
off the shelves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5:56 a.m. quake, centered three miles northeast of the city of San 
Fernando, was also felt in Thousand Oaks and across eastern Ventura County, and 
as far west as Camarillo. The quake shook for as long as 15 seconds in parts of 
the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. Caltech seismologists said it was also 
felt on Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, residents reported a brief but startling early-morning 
shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scared me at first, because I didn't know how long it was going to last," 
said Marina Glezin, 15, of Thousand Oaks. "It just shook for a second, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, smaller aftershocks struck many of the same areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the more emotional people were just starting to relax," said Kate 
Hutton at Caltech. "This was a pretty good feeler. It's the nature of nature, 
and we can't do much about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As jarring as the aftershock was, scientists said it was not only normal, but 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucile M. Jones, a U. S. Geological Survey seismologist, said a computer 
analysis predicted that the area would get four aftershocks of at least 
magnitude 4 between March 20 -- the date of the last significant aftershock -- 
and Wednesday's temblor. Instead, there has been only this one, and it was a 
relatively minor one at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a little less than would have been expected," Jones said. "It is not 
very typical at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents a few miles from the epicenter were shaken particularly hard. At the 
Tahitian Mobile Home Park in Sylmar, where 64 trailers burned after the 
Northridge quake, the jolt renewed fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking that if it went on any longer, I would throw my body over my 
sons, and then it stopped," said Susan Rezvani, 37, standing with her two boys, 
Neema, 12, and Naveed, 4, outside a friend's trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Hofmann, 60, has lived in a motor home outside his Sylmar house since it 
was red-tagged after the Northridge quake. During Wednesday's temblor, he said, 
the trailer bounced up and down like a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the epicenter was here ," Hofmann said. "Everybody started yelling 
and screaming, 'My God, not again!' " The only casualty in his makeshift home 
was a fax machine that fell from a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the damage was minor. Cracks in the walls of homes not yet 
repaired from the January quake widened, chandeliers swung, dishes broke and 
frightened children hopped in bed with parents who could not get back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported electricity, water or phone service disruptions, and no 
freeway closures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 8,000 aftershocks since the Jan. 17 quake, about 400 have been felt. 
Seven aftershocks were between magnitude 5.0 and 6.0; about 40 were between 4.0 
and 5.0. More than 300 were between 3.0 and 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 20 aftershock, which was magnitude 5.3 and centered near Panorama 
City, sparked two fires in the San Fernando Valley, but caused no injuries. 
</P>
<P>

CLERK AT FAIR HELD ON SUSPICION OF THEFT

<P>
 A clerk at the Ventura County Fairgrounds was arrested Wednesday on suspicion 
of stealing $12,000 from the fair's off-track betting facility, Ventura police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee's name was not available Wednesday night, police said, but 
Ventura County Fair officials confirmed that the employee was a parimutuel 
clerk who accepted wagers from patrons at the fair's Watch and Wager center. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk was detained at about 5:45 p.m. by fairground security officials 
after they discovered that the clerk's till was $12,000 short, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They discovered it during the normal checks and balances," said Teri Raley, 
spokeswoman for the fair. "They know exactly to the penny how much should be in 
those tills." 
</P>
<P>
 Raley said the suspect was not employed by the Ventura County Fair, but by 
Southern California Off-Track Wagering Inc., a Los Alamitos-based organization 
that provides parimutuel services to off-track locations. PEGGY Y. LEE

SEASON TO TASTE; SUMMER SMORGASBORD FEATURES LIGHT FARE FOR ALL MANNER OF 
ENTERTAINMENT INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer may be the cruelest season for devotees of the "serious" arts as High 
Culture takes a holiday, but it's shaping up as a windfall for just about 
everybody else in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking things off this week are two of the hottest tours in recent memory: 
Barbra Streisand, in Anaheim for six nights at The Pond, and the reconstituted 
Eagles, putting in a five-night stint at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 In between the big-name attractions, meanwhile, are some smaller pleasures, 
from Cajun stars Beausoleil at the down-home Coach House to Ray Charles at the 
tony Orange County Performing Arts Center. Even the usually nostalgia-oriented 
Orange County Fair gets into the act, with a concert by the Neville Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Performing Arts Center, meanwhile, will play host to Andrew Lloyd Webber's 
"The Phantom of the Opera," starting in July. A multidate engagement of the 
Rockettes (with Susan Anton) is set for June. 
</P>
<P>
 At Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, the Pacific Symphony loosens its bow-tie as it 
moves to its alfresco digs. 
</P>
<P>
 And amid it all, there's still room for Shakespeare, though not at the 
now-quiet Festival Amphitheatre in Garden Grove. Shakespeare Orange County, 
heir apparent to the late GroveShakespeare, puts on "Twelfth Night" and "King 
Lear" at Chapman College.

 Over at the amusement parks, meanwhile, it looks like a low-key summer. 
Knott's opens its special-effects-laden but relatively sedate Mystery Lodge on 
Saturday, while Disneyland has nary a new attraction (unless you haven't 
checked out Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin, which opened a few months back).

SMOKE AND MIRRORS; NEWFANGLED EFFECTS AND OLD-FASHIONED STORYTELLING CREATE AN 
ATTRACTION WITH A MESSAGE, BUT IT'S NOT A TRICKY ONE: TO PASS ON OUR BEST TO

 Technology marches on. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of Knott's Berry Farm's earliest Ghost Town attractions, the Covered 
Wagon Show, visitors look at a static scale diorama of a wagon train crossing a 
desert plain while listening to recorded voices retell the travails of the 
Knott family pioneers as they came out West. It's an oddly affecting slice of 
Americana, but a special effects extravaganza it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening this weekend just outside the bounds of Ghost Town, behind the old 
Birdcage Theater, is Mystery Lodge. Inside a re-creation of a Canadian Indian 
lodge of the Pacific Northwest, an aged storyteller (played by a live actor) 
conjures images from the smoke of a mystic campfire: wispy silhouettes of his 
wife and children as they were earlier in life, the face of an owl portending 
death, a squawking raven that flies up into the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the 10-minute main show, the storyteller disappears and reappears, 
repeatedly and instantaneously. At one point his face is transformed into that 
of the raven, the trickster of his culture's mythology. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is an impressive display of high-tech, how'd-they-do-that trickery. 
The patented process is called Holovision, which presumably involves 
holography, but the attraction's creator will only smile and talk coyly about 
"magic" when asked how it all works. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rogers, president and founder of Burbank-based BRC Imagination Arts, is 
justly proud of the attraction's technical achievements. But in an interview 
last week outside the show's exit, he said the technology is meant to serve the 
story's message, which he described as a universal call to find the best in 
ourselves and pass it on to our children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of us has something good and beautiful to give to the generations that 
follow, and the part of you that you give never dies, but lives forever," the 
storyteller tells the audience, after giving a metaphor-laden overview of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What better way to spend your time than talking, laughing, telling stories, 
sharing what is good and true, sharing life, with those you love?" 
</P>
<P>
 If it's beginning to sound like Mystery Lodge may not have as many 
death-defying thrills as the new Batman ride at Magic Mountain -- well, you're 
starting to get the picture. The point of Mystery Lodge is to "uplift the heart 
rather than the stomach," said Rogers, which fits right in with the Knott's 
plan of offering family-style attractions along with the roller-coasters.  
</P>
<P>
 The attraction is designed for a wide age range, Rogers said: Younger children 
will be captivated by the "magic" of the show, he predicted, while adults will 
also tune into the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery Lodge is the descendant of Spirit Lodge, a BRC-produced attraction 
that was a hit at Expo '86 in Vancouver, B.C. That's where Terry E. Van Gorder, 
president of Knott's, saw the show and took an interest, starting a series of 
discussions that has now brought a spruced-up version of the show to the Buena 
Park amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 For both Spirit Lodge and Mystery Lodge, BRC worked with the 
Kwak'wala-speaking 'Namgis people of Alert Bay, on Commorant Island in British 
Columbia. Theme parks have a less-than-sterling record of depicting Native 
American culture, usually leaning heavily on old cowboy-versus-Indian movie 
stereotypes, a hurdle that Rogers had to overcome when he first approached the 
'Namgis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not in general been a very good relationship," said Rogers, speaking 
about the standoff between Native Americans and amusement parks. "By rights, 
they shouldn't even have returned our calls." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Spirit Lodge, Rogers' company and its Native American and Canadian 
Indian advisers struck up a cooperative relationship, which they relied on to 
plan the Knott's attraction. "They corrected us on every level of detail," 
Rogers said, from "broad philosophical points to tiny details" -- such as 
whether the 'Namgis wear ponytails (they don't). 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cranmer, a Canadian Indian adviser to the show and the recorded voice of 
the Mystery Lodge storyteller, said he and the people of his group were "a 
little skeptical" when Rogers first approached them about the Expo '86 idea, 
but "he convinced us it wasn't going to be just a Hollywood show." 
</P>
<P>
 So later, when Rogers returned with the concept of sprucing up the show for 
Knott's, Cranmer was more than willing to help. Van Gorder himself made a trip 
to Alert Bay to talk up the project. "Terry came up to our place a couple of 
years ago and talked to us, and he seemed to be a very sincere person," Cranmer 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Cranmer is chairman of the board of directors of the Umista Cultural Center in 
Alert Bay, which displays many of the ceremonial items of his culture. Umista 
is a word meaning something that has been taken away and returned, an apt 
description for most of the works on display. 
</P>
<P>
 The potlatch, an elaborate feast and gift-giving ritual, is a central feature 
of many of the native coastal cultures of the Pacific Northwest. Early in this 
century, it was outlawed by the Canadian government, which was trying to force 
the assimilation of tribal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Cranmer's father, Dan Cranmer, gave a potlatch in the fall of 1921, and in 
1922 more than 20 of the people who had taken part were jailed. The ceremonial 
masks and other items were confiscated and distributed to museums and other 
institutions in Canada and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A large part of the culture was lost when the potlatch was made illegal and 
our people were sent to jail," Bill Cranmer said. Many of those items were 
returned beginning in 1980, and the Umista Cultural Center houses that 
collection.  
</P>
<P>
 Issues of sensitivity now surrounding depictions of Native American culture 
have scared off most theme parks, but with Mystery Lodge, Knott's continues to 
buck the trend. In 1992, the park opened Indian Trails, a theme area in Ghost 
Town that includes re-creations of traditional housing and other educational 
displays, along with a stage for performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Apodaca, curator of Native American art at the Bowers Museum in Santa 
Ana, was an adviser on that project. Even Knott's well-intentioned efforts have 
been criticized by some in the Native American community, he said, but such 
complaints are often unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have approached the attractions as they would a museum exhibit, he said, 
while in fact Knott's is first and foremost a business, one that seeks to 
entertain. "If along the way they also seek to inform, that's great," Apodaca 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that they were willing to not just use the entertainment image of 
Indians was wonderful," he added. "It's better to approach all these issues and 
try and develop them than to avoid them. . . . My take is, what they're trying 
to do at Knott's is a positive thing."

 The key ingredient added to this year's Garden Grove Strawberry Festival isn't 
another gallon of whipped cream for the "world's largest strawberry shortcake." 
It's a way to work off all those calories: line dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Country Strawberry" is the theme of the 36th annual fete, chosen because "we 
wanted to do something that would give the whole family more things to do, like 
line dancing," said festival president Stu Finkelstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-member Kountry Sass troupe will be tush-pushing and giving line dance 
lessons on Saturday from 1 to 3 p.m., and live country music will be provided 
by the Kelly Rae Band on Main Street between Acacia Parkway and Stanford Avenue 
at the festival's Showmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Relax. A good line dancer isn't necessarily one with nonpareil technique or 
even the right, tight jeans, says Julie Weith, Kountry Sass' manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's someone who's having fun," explains Weith, who says she choreographed 
the hopping popular line dance "Honky Tonk Attitude." "It doesn't matter if 
they have the steps right. Sometimes people get up and take it very, very 
seriously, like school." 
</P>
<P>
 Some 200,000 attended last year's festival, which began in 1958 as a 
celebration of the berry that was then one of Orange County's biggest crops. 
About the same number are expected at this weekend's event, which will also to 
feature clogging, square dancing and trick roping exhibitions as well as the 
usual carnival games, rides, arts and craft sale and food. Free slices of 
strawberry shortcake will go to 4,000 lucky comers on Friday beginning at 6 
p.m. at the Showmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Earl Holliman and Billy Barty will preside as grand marshal and emcee, 
respectively, and other Hollywood and sports celebrities will march in 
Saturday's 10:30 a.m. parade and sign autographs afterward. The parade takes a 
one-mile route, starting at the corner of 9th Street and Chapman Avenue, and 
winding up two hours later near the Village Green at the corner of Stanford 
Avenue and Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Garden Grove & Friends will stage a musical revue at the Festival 
Amphitheatre (the site of all activities except the parade, autograph session 
and Saturday's line dancing) Sunday evening at 7:30. Monday's lineup features 
the annual "Redhead Round-Up" contest at 4 p.m. Open to all ages, the contest 
will include entrants with the "best strawberry blond" hair and "most 
freckles." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day festival is free, but charities will once again receive all 
proceeds from fees charged by ride operators, according to Finkelstein, a 
Garden Grove Police Department lieutenant. In the past 35 years, nearly $2 
million has been donated to a wide variety of groups, many of them in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 What: 36th annual Garden Grove Strawberry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, May 27, 1 to 11:30 p.m.; Saturday, May 28, 10 a.m. to midnight;

GETTING THEIR OWN VOICES; COMEDIAN-VENTRILOQUIST JEFF DUNHAM USES TIME ON THE 
ROAD TO FLESH OUT DUMMIES' CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As someone who flies constantly and is on the road about 40 weeks a year doing 
250 to 300 dates, comedian-ventriloquist Jeff Dunham shouldn't be surprised by 
much. Or so you'd think. But one incident in Alabama a while back left him 
muttering. 
</P>
<P>
 He was putting his bags through the X-ray machine at a little airport in the 
middle of nowhere, and as he always does, he was packing his main men (Peanut 
and Walter) on board with him. Each dummy has a head with a stick running down 
through the body, which, according to Dunham, gave pause to the security 
"goober." 
</P>
<P>
 "He stops it, looks at it and asks me, 'You got a banjo in there?' No, it's a 
head, I told him. 'Well, have a nice day,' " Dunham recalled in a recent 
interview from a Boston hotel. "I guess heads are OK," Dunham concluded, "but 
stringed instruments are a threat in Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
 Such episodes, the Dallas native concedes, come with the territory. Besides, 
he's quick to add, it's better than being at home 40 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Dunham, who performs at the Brea Improv tonight through Sunday, is 
content with life on the road. It gives him a chance to flesh out his act, with 
an eye to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always got (ideas) in the microwave for TV shows and whatever," said 
Dunham, who often slips into using the ventriloquists' we . "We're building a 
nice little following across the country. We're doing the trench work now. Who 
knows what it's going to build to. We're just working hard and keeping the 
intensity up, trying to keep people entertained longer and longer with new 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Developing material as opposed to adding new dummies represents a change for 
Dunham, who had focused on adding characters to expand his act, instead of 
concentrating on giving depth to the current cast. The delay in shifting 
emphasis, however, is understandable. Dunham is considered by fans, peers and 
club owners one of the top ventriloquists working today, and he's among a 
handful who can do a six-way conversation, which he admits is what initially 
got him on the "Tonight Show." But he saw it was time to put some meat on the 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people come to see my show (any more) because I'm a good 
ventriloquist," he explained, adding that he only does the six-voices thing 
once in a while now. "I think they come for the comedy. They just enjoy 
laughing. I don't think anyone comes to be amazed any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The act has taken on a sitcom sort of feel. The characters have gotten 
deeper, their histories more detailed. I feel that's where I'm at now. I've 
known these characters for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, to propel his career, Dunham -- who earned a bachelor's degree in 
radio, TV and film from Baylor University in Waco, Tex. -- moved to Los 
Angeles. In 1990 he did the first of five "Tonight" shows with Johnny Carson, 
where the curmudgeonly Walter, who refused to be interviewed for this article, 
took over the show, insulting both Carson and sidekick Ed McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Walter shares the stage with Peanut (a woozle, kind of a Muppet on 
heroin, as Dunham says) and Bubba (a redneck, recent addition). Walter, 
however, isn't too upset with his slightly diminished role. Dunham has given 
him a new star vehicle, the "Dear Walter Segment," in which the old sourpuss 
fields questions from the crowd. It's Dunham's favorite part. 
</P>
<P>
 "That always makes for a whole new show, creating brand new jokes," he said. 
"He's getting better; the personality builds." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham estimates that in the eight months since he last played Brea, he has 
added 35% to 40% new material. 
</P>
<P>
 "It constantly rolls over, but there are bits and pieces I like to keep in 
there. There's a bunch of new things at the beginning, end and middle. Usually 
it's ad libs that turn into bits, but some stuff I actually sit down and 
write." 
</P>
<P>
 That means he'll be doodling on his Quadra, "a big bad machine," at his 
recently purchased Encino home. Dunham, 32, has entered the Computer Age with a 
vengeance. It has taken a huge byte out of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Macintosh nut. I got my power book, so if I'm not writing jokes, I'm 
working on that." 
</P>
<P>
 His slide into computers began early in his career when he was flying to 
shows. To kill time in the air, he bought a "little bitty cheapie word 
processor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I taught myself computer. Then Macintosh came along, and it became a really 
bad addiction. If I wasn't in show business, I'd have pocket protectors growing 
out of my chest. I do everything on it. It's kinda sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Even using the creative side of his brain, Dunham can't come up with an 
explanation for his fascination with the machines, given that he's 
mathematically challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Math? Forget about it. If I add four plus eight plus six, I have to count on 
my fingers. I guess I'm hooked up differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to his past turns up no clues, either. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his Texas youth doing shows for Cub Scouts, civic groups and any 
other paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never considered doing anything else, never had another job, never turned 
my back on it." 
</P>
<P>
 From all the work and careful planning Dunham has put into his career has come 
an interesting phenomenon, which, again, Dunham can't explain. When he 
introduces Walter and Peanut, both get a fine round of applause, as expected. 
But when Jose, the jalapeno on a stick, is introduced for his brief cameo in 
the show, the ventriloquist is at a loss for what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I bring out Jose, the applause is deafening," Dunham said. "One club 
owner told me he was becoming a weird cult figure. I have no idea why. He has a 
Mexican accent and he's on a stick." 
</P>
<P>
 The easygoing Dunham, however, is not protesting any of this too much. The sum 
of the parts makes for a very successful whole. And as the only member of his 
entourage who can drive a car and spend money, he knows what such success can 
translate into: a new Dodge Viper. Unfortunately, he hasn't had much chance to 
enjoy his new toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought it at 10 p.m. and left town at 6 a.m.," he explained. "I can't wait 
to come home and drive it. It's sex on wheels, an engine on wheels." 
</P>
<P>
 The new car also replaces an earlier hobby. Dunham used to build and fly 
helicopters, but the road work has taken its toll on that pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to put flying on the back burner," he said, with a twinge of lament. 
"I'm on the ground now but going twice as fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Comedian-ventriloquist Jeff Dunham, with Peanut, Walter, Bubba and, of 
course, Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Tonight, May 26, at 8:30; Friday and Saturday, May 27 and 28, at 8:30 
and 10:30; Sunday, May 29, at 7:30 and 9:30. Tickets remain for only the late

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: MC5 "KICK OUT THE JAMS" (1969) ELEKTRA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I want to hear some revolution out there! Time has come for you to decide 
whether you're going to be part of the problem or the solution. . . . Are you 
ready to testify?!" With that stirring call to '60s activism, Rob Tyner kicked 
off one of the most gloriously noisy live albums ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 But few are aware of the unadulterated power at the heart of "Kick Out the 
Jams." Even back in '69, most rock fans missed the boat. This startling debut 
album was a good eight to 10 years ahead of its time: With its hammering guitar 
chords, reckless pace and incendiary spirit, it was punk rock before there was 
such a term. Songs like "Come Together" (no, not the Beatles' tune) and the 
rousing title track were delivered with such explosive energy that they often 
feel as if they're about to careen out of control. Eschewing the solos that 
defined much of the heavier rock of the day, guitarists Fred (Sonic) Smith and 
Wayne Kramer stuck mostly to the type of intense riffing that would help define 
the post-'70s hard-core and thrash bands (though the duo does deliver some 
tasty leads during the slithering blues number "Motor City Is Burning"). 
</P>
<P>
 The group couldn't have found a more suitable front man than Tyner, whose 
vocals are sometimes rebellious, sometimes desperate and always passionate and 
whose soulful political raps resonate with the anti-establishment spirit of the 
times. Based in Detroit (MC5 stood for Motor City Five), the group was a kind 
of house band for John Sinclair's radical White Panther Party and was known for 
wearing American flags and for screaming political slogans laced with 
obscenities. Indeed, some stores refused to carry "Kick Out the Jams" because 
of a profanity shouted out by Tyner at the start of the title song. 
</P>
<P>
 (After the cobweb-blasting "Kick Out the Jams," the 5 released two studio 
albums that were acclaimed by critics, but poor sales contributed to the band's 
demise in the early '70s.) JON MATSUMOTO

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: JAMIE O'HARA "RISE ABOVE IT" RCA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamie O'Hara is back on his own after making three admirable albums as half of 
the O'Kanes. His partner in that band, Kieran Kane, released his first 
post-O'Kanes album earlier this year, and now the other shoe drops with 
O'Hara's new solo effort.O'Kanes fans should be pleased to find that the rich 
drawl, the swampy Southern country-rock musical settings and unconventional 
takes on life and love that typified the O'Kanes are still very much present 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most comforting things about this album is that O'Hara hasn't 
abandoned writing from unusual points of view. In "The Cold Hard Truth," the 
voice of objective reality speaks to a man who would try to deceive himself and 
others about his responsibility for hurting the one he loved: "You say you're 
not the one to blame / For all the heartache she's been through / I say you're 
nothin' but a liar / I am the cold hard truth." In another, he assumes the 
voice of a man's heart who straightforwardly declares "It Ain't Over ('Til Your 
Heart Says It's Over"). 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he can write simply and powerfully in the first person, as 
he does in "For Reasons I've Forgotten." The song, which Emmylou Harris covered 
recently, is a confession of remorse over a relationship that disintegrated.  
</P>
<P>
 While he doesn't quite pull off the Gargantuan task of gleaning some 
transcendent meaning from the Vietnam War in a three-minute song ("50,000 
Names"), he does exceedingly well when he sticks close to heart and home for 
most of the rest of the album. RANDY LEWIS

PICKLE DILLY; FAMILY CIRCUS GOES FROM LOSING SLEEP OVER FINANCES TO 'TOSSING 
AND TURNING' IN AN ANTIC ENSEMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Performers in the Pickle Family Circus know how to fly without a net, even 
when they're not airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1993, having filed for bankruptcy and barely enough money to 
keep gas in the truck, members of this 20-year-old San Francisco performing 
troupe stayed on the road, even capping off their tour with a performance in 
Washington's Kennedy Center.  
</P>
<P>
 To cut costs, the Pickles tripled up in hotel rooms, took on administrative 
chores and, ultimately, with the help of Bay Area supporters and the artistic 
guidance of dancer/choreographer Tandy Beal, managed to not only stay afloat 
but to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with offices in San Francisco and Santa Cruz, the New Pickle Family 
Circus will bring its "Tossing and Turning" show to the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
from Friday through Sunday. It will also have its first tour outside the United 
States in 15 years when it plays Japan in October and is developing another 
original show to premiere in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pickles are not your standard circus. There are no jump-roping chimps, 
bosomy women on elephants or cheesy souvenirs. Unlike traditional American 
circuses with their series of essentially unrelated acts strung together by a 
show director, the Pickles work as an ensemble, with each member capable of 
performing in any number of styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shows also have a story line. "Tossing and Turning," which Beal based on 
her experience with insomnia, follows hapless Razz the Ringmaster (Jeff Raz) as 
he battles sleeplessness. Alternately aided and aggravated by Pino (diminutive 
Diane Wasnak), Razz must contend with a pesky mosquito (Wasnak in outlandish 
headgear), hip-hopping sheep, an uncooperative pillow (Wasnak, again) and an 
assortment of other irritants in his quest for 40 winks. Music, some of it 
performed on stage by the cast, punctuates the action. 
</P>
<P>
 As metal bowls clanged to the floor while Wasnak rehearsed a new bicycle stunt 
in the background at their San Francisco rehearsal space, Raz discussed the 
Pickles during a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The ringmaster -- who has a background in juggling, acrobatics and theater -- 
said he joined in 1991 to fill the troupe's need for a bottom mount ("that's 
the guy that holds people up") for Wasnak as well as someone who could play 
drums and bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, with guidance of Beal and Lu Yi, a former member of the Nanjing 
Acrobatic Troupe who serves as the Pickles' trainer, he has developed an even 
wider range of skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a premium on versatile performers," he explained. "This is much more 
of a theatrical circus, an ensemble (in which) anyone can juggle, do 
acrobatics, dance . . . in the show. The performer who is a sheep doing back 
flips at one point will come back later and do something totally different. 
There's a real weaving going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, said Raz, it was the spirit of the ensemble that helped keep the 
Pickles afloat during those troubled times last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, we had Chinese performers, a Russian and a French Canadian (in 
the cast)," he recalled. "Every time we had a meeting to discuss the subject, 
we had to translate it into four languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "But no matter what their language was, everybody said the same thing: 'I want 
to be here.' On any day, somebody could have gone home, and that would have 
been it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," he added with a laugh, "we were getting standing ovations and had a 
gig at the Kennedy Center, and no performer in their right mind would give up 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1974 by a group drawn largely from the San Francisco Mime Troupe, 
the original Pickle Family Circus was created to present a popular form of 
theater that combined music, drama, dance and humor with traditional circus 
skills, according to the group's press release, which also states that several 
notable performers, including internationally known theatrical clown Bill 
Irwin, have come out of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the group's original members began to leave, and the circus went 
through a number of administrative and artistic changes in leadership before 
the bankruptcy filing in the spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Beal, director of the contemporary dance group Tandy Beal & Company, had 
choreographed a Pickle show in 1990 and was with the troupe in 1993 as creator 
and show director of "Tossing and Turning." Unwilling to see the Pickles go 
under, Beal's nonprofit management company, the Friends of Olympia Station, 
took over the circus assets, and with the help of arts consultant Barbara 
Kibbe, helped give the troupe a new start. The company is now headed by a 
six-person team that includes Beal, Raz, Wasnak and the development, marketing 
and business managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes, Raz says, the current batch of Pickles has remained true 
to the original goal of entertaining as broad an audience as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had three and four generations of a family come up after a show and say 
how much they enjoyed it," Raz said. "One of the greatest compliments we get is 
parents saying 'I loved it; the little ones loved it, and my teen-ager loved 
it. And they haven't loved anything in about 3 1/2 years!' "

DO IT!: GO JUMP IN A LAKE, TRIATHLETES

<P>
 Memorial Day is a quiet weekend when it comes to organized runs, bike rides 
and other group events in Orange County. Most people, it seems, prefer relaxing 
at family get-togethers to working up a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some folks, however, will be turning down that second helping of barbecue in 
anticipation of next weekend's big event -- the 1994 Orange County Performing 
Arts Center Triathlon, to be held June 5 in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The triathlon is two events, really. First is the amateur event, expected to 
draw more than 1,000 competitors. It will include a one-kilometer freshwater 
swim in Lake Mission Viejo, a 30K bike ride (over part of the same course used 
in the 1984 Olympics) and finally an 8K run. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward is the professional race, a lap-style event at the longer 
"international" distance: a 1.5K swim, 40K bike ride and 10K run. The event was 
recently named the Triathlon Federation/USA's "International Distance Triathlon 
of the Year." Also, for the first time, the race is the U.S. qualifier for the 
1994 Goodwill Games to be held this summer in St. Petersburg, Russia (the top 
three U.S. male and female finishers automatically qualify). 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the top triathletes in the world are scheduled to attend. Australia's 
Michellie Jones, winner of 1993's World Triathlon Championship and the 1993 
OCPAC, leads the women's field, to be challenged by the top U.S. competitor, 
Karen Smyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the men will be Spencer Smith, who won the men's version of the 1993 
World Triathlon Championship, along with Dave Scott, six-time champion of the 
Gatorade Ironman in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing will be Brad Kearns, who won the OCPAC in 1990 and 1991, and 
Irvine native Andy Carlson, the OCPAC runner-up last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Total purse is $20,000, and the top male and female finishers will each win a 
Mazda Miata. For amateurs, awards will be given to the top performers in 22 age 
groups and 13 open and corporate relay divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Blending the two events, amateur and professional, offers an opportunity for 
competitors and spectators alike. The amateur race starts at 7 a.m. and the 
professional at 11 a.m., both at Lake Mission Viejo. Spectators are welcome but 
are advised that only street parking is available. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no race-day registration for the amateur event (the professional race 
is by invitation only). Call event organizers ahead of the race for entry 
information or go to the Triathlon and Fitness Expo on June 4 at Crystal Court 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The day is expected to raise more than $60,000 for the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, and organizers are looking for volunteers to staff aid 
stations and help in other ways on race day. 
</P>
<P>
 Call (714) 556-2122, Ext. 556, for more information. Overall, more than 
$500,000 has been raised in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 What: 1994 Orange County Performing Arts Center Triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, June 5. Amateur race at 7 a.m., professional race at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Starts and finishes at Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (5) Freeway, exit at Alicia Parkway and head 
east several miles to the lake. Look for street parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $65 for members of Triathlon Federation/USA, $70 for non-members 
(free to spectators).

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: STRONG SWELL MAKES FOR A HO NEW ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The strong five-foot south swell that banged across Orange County beaches 
provided great waves for the Bud Tour's Body Glove contest at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Fig, the announcer at the May 11-15 tour, said he saw five- to 
eight-foot faces that had Hawaiian pros, such as current world champion Derek 
Ho, talking it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho told Figgy that surfing clean, top-to-bottom waves had changed his mind 
about So Cal's reputation for dinky surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I've come to Southern California, especially Huntington Beach, lots of 
times," Ho told Fig. "And I always thought it was mushy. But I got some barrels 
this time!" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ho posted a 9.5 (of a possible 10) for the highest individual wave 
score at the contest, held at the Santa Ana River jetties. Ho's ride impressed 
Figgy. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Ho's wave was a big set wave that went left. It started off just like 
Pipe. Ho then pulled in and did a big disappearance act just like at home. He 
came out of the barrel and was jamming down the line and went right into 
another peak. It was amazing. He then flew off the bottom and just went WHACK! 
Right at the lip. It was one of the heaviest waves.  
</P>
<P>
 But unfortunately for Ho, he failed to put together many more like it and 
finished seventh. The finals saw former world champ Kelly Slater of Florida -- 
yup, him again after taking the Katin contest earlier this month -- and 
Cardiff's Rob Machado in a classic duel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig said Slater was "totally mental" for the last heat, winning the Body Glove 
contest for $4,000. Machado was second, Ross Williams of Hawaii grabbed third 
and Marty Thomas of Long Beach was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was neck and neck with Machado. Then Slater hit big time on the best wave 
of the finals. He did a front-side 360, backside 360, threw a front-side air, 
and then threw a backside air, then capped it with a 180. And, let me tell you, 
Machado was ripping, too. He was just knifing waves off the top. It was close; 
Machado was leading halfway through the final, when all of a sudden Slater went 
mental with that wave.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the awards were handed out, spectators were treated to an impromptu jam 
session with surfers who swapped surfboards for guitars. Musician Gary Hoey, 
who performed some of the soundtrack on "Endless Summer II: The Journey 
Continues," joined surfers Slater, Machado and Donovan Frankenreiter of Laguna 
Niguel, who plays in the band Sun Child. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Movie: "Endless Summer II," the long-awaited project from filmmaker Bruce 
Brown, was pre-screened last week. Mike Reilley, a sportswriter for The Times, 
called it "a helluva surf flick." Cool, Mike. But next time, remember to pick 
up those people you invite. I would've loved to have seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Movie II: "Endless Summer II" will be screened at a premiere benefit for 
Surfrider Foundation at 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Santa Monica AMC theater, Third 
Street Promenade. Tickets are $50. For VIP seats, $100. For more information, 
call Surfrider Foundation, (714) 492-8170. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Movie III: Brown, who made the original "Endless Summer" 30 years ago, will be 
awarded the Waterman Achievement Award on June 4 at the fifth annual Waterman's 
Ball, at the Noguchi garden (California Scenario) in Costa Mesa. The Surf 
Industry Manufacturers Assn., which is hosting the event, hopes the occasion 
will raise $100,000 for environmental organizations. Tickets are $100. Call 
(714) 760-0784. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig and I plan to attend the much-delayed release, which follows two surfers, 
Robert (Wingnut) Weaver and Pat O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we're tired of waiting. We want to see what O'Connell has to offer. 
Imagine surfing around the world and getting $100,000 to do it!  
</P>

<P>
 Brazil: The U.S. Surfing Federation's national team returned from the world 
amateur surfing championship in Brazil with a disappointing fifth place. The 
Australians just nipped the Brazilian team for the title. Hawaii took third, 
South Africa was fourth and France, sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Kalani Robb of Team Hawaii and Corey Lopez of Team U.S.A. took first 
and fourth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Figgy said the Hawaiian and U.S. teams should be combined and compete as one. 
The Fig was part of the U.S. team in the mid-'70s that took the world title in 
France. Fig's high on Robb, saying he's gonna be another Machado. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Set in Stone: The Huntington Beach Surfing Walk of Fame inauguration will be 
held at 11 a.m. Saturday at Jack's Surf Store, PCH and Main.

CAGED HEAT; EVEN NOW, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE DELICIOUS SOUND AND STINGING 
FEEL OF MAKING CONTACT, BAT ON BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 My baseball career ended abruptly in high school, just about the time they 
started to throw this astounding, unbelievable, unhittable pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 It was called the curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 It would come winging in, straight for my head; I would make a dive for the 
dugout, and the umpires would throw little fits and bark "Steeeeeeeee!"  
</P>
<P>
 I took my revenge at the batting cages near my house. The machines were a 
mecca for hundreds of pipsqueak Rod Carews, and they threw nothing but 
fastballs. Straight over the plate. Every time. 
</P>
<P>
 I would haul my wonderful Louisville Slugger into the box, shove the tokens 
into the machine and, for a blissful half hour or so, launch ball after ball 
out into the netting. The curveball did not exist. I was still a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you finally face the wretched, inevitable reality of your 
incompetence as a breaking-ball hitter -- and therefore a washout at baseball 
-- you turn reluctantly to the less-than-macho yet hugely popular slo-pitch 
softball, and you start to hang out with guys like Crazy Al and the boys from 
Consolidated Sheet Metal and Bail Bonds. And you leave the batting cages 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cages exert a siren appeal. And it had been -- what? -- maybe 20 years 
since I had swung a bat at fast pitching. It would be unconscionable, I 
reasoned, to let what was left of my youth (about a week and a half, by my 
count) pass without jacking a few out into left field one more time and hearing 
that delicious sound of pure contact and, above all, feeling that round, 
radiant pulse in the hands that means you have just connected on the fattest, 
most lethal part of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 So, last Friday morning, I arrived at the start of business at the Family Fun 
Center in Fountain Valley, ready to take my first cuts as a geezer-in-training. 
The first thing I noticed was that the machines threw no faster than 70 m.p.h. 
I recalled as a youth that the cages fired at the Nolan Ryanesque clip of 90 
m.p.h. Oh well, I thought. I'll have to settle for a bunch of namby-pamby lobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But, just to make sure all my baseball reactions hadn't atrophied, I began 
with 40 m.p.h. The friendly guy behind the counter issued me a helmet, the bat 
of my choice (a 33 but, alas, a metal one with a rubber-coated handle). I 
stuffed a few dollar bills into a machine in exchange for a pocketful of 
tokens. Eighteen pitches for a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 I inserted the tokens, turned and stepped into the batter's box, and felt 
immediately awkward. Were the feet planted properly? How were the arms held? 
Too high? Too low? Was I crowding the plate? I shuffled around distractedly, 
the red light on the machine glowed, indicating that a pitch was imminent and 
then, suddenly, there it was, humming toward me on a fine, flat trajectory, 
pregnant and glowing in the sun, flashing neon words, "HIT ME!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was more of a spasm than a swing, and it produced a galloping ground ball 
that began with the oddest sound I had ever heard with a bat in my hand: BONK! 
</P>
<P>
 I straightened up, waggled the bat. OK, you've seen this machine's one and 
only pitch. Now hit it. Out shot a second ball. Another BONK! 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Slow down. Just make contact. Be patient. See what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 WHACK! 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't quite the juicy crack of ash on horsehide (the balls at the cages 
are hard, heathen plastic), but the feeling was unmistakable: a swelling 
pressure in the hands as sweet as a lover's heartbeat. No effort, no shock, no 
pain. And the ball rocketed over the machines and went snick! into the netting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On they came, one after another, and one after another I sent them sailing 
away. A few miscued grounders snuck in, but after 36 pitches I felt I was the 
master of the 40 m.p.h. machine. I moved on to 50. 
</P>
<P>
 This was even better. I had been pulling the ball at 40, but now the balls 
were sailing straight into center. Except for the ones that didn't. These were 
the ones that I conked off the handle when I unconsciously crowded the plate. 
I'd forgotten how those shots can hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 At 60 m.p.h., the ball began to move. Yes, it did. I began to hit rotten, 
miserable foul tips. And even more dying quails off the handle. And this time 
those shots hurt. I felt like a cartoon character, vibrating like a violin 
string with the waves radiating out from the wrists. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were a few fine shots, one or two of which might have been in 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 I had now swung at 72 pitches and noticed that two patches of skin had worn 
off on my left index finger and the heel of the same hand. I visited the guy at 
the counter on the off chance he'd have a Band-Aid. He instantly forked over 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 I needn't have bothered. It came off after two swings in the 70 m.p.h. cage. 
The balls were hissing as if they'd been shot from a cannon. I began to miss 
entirely. And when I finally did make contact it was -- yes -- on the handle 
and my hands shattered into shards. At least I thought they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Lord! I thought. How does anyone hit Roger Clemens? He throws it another 
25 m.p.h. faster than this! And you can never be sure he's not throwing it at 
your head! No wonder they pay these guys the big money. 
</P>
<P>
 I kept flailing. Foul. Foul. OUCH!! Foul. 
</P>
<P>
 WHACK! 
</P>
<P>
 Over the machines, into the netting. Like a bullet. That beautiful caress in 
the hands. Maybe not a home run, but maybe . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I turned my gear in with noodle arms, feeling thoroughly humbled. And then I 
thought of Michael Jordan, trying to learn to hit big league pitching after 
being away from pitching of any kind since high school. I pulled into traffic 
on the freeway and grinned. For a few minutes, I had been like Mike.

VIDEO REWIND: 'RULING CLASS' HAS AN HEIR OF HOLY MADNESS ABOUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTHANNE SALIDO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wealthy and distinguished 13th Earl of Gurney, who gets his jollies by 
hanging from a noose in his bedroom, goes a little too far one day and -- blast 
it all -- dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. Phone the heir. 
</P>
<P>
 This is about as sane as things get in "The Ruling Class," which follows the 
new earl's "road to sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were closest to the deceased earl (and believe the will failed to 
give them their fair share) are upset that such a big cut is going to the heir, 
his son (Peter O'Toole), who thinks he's Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is an effort to put the new earl, or J.C., as he likes to be 
called, in his place (i.e. in a straitjacket) and to let saner, and greedier, 
minds prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does J.C. think he's God? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simple," he says. "When I pray to him, I find I'm talking to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The theory of J.C.'s psychologist (Michael Bryant) is that since J.C. suffers 
from delusions of grandeur, he must, as an English aristocrat, believe he's the 
one person grander than himself -- God. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't tell by now, the movie pokes fun at the British ruling class, 
whose members make all kinds of speeches dripping with dignity about "our 
England" this and "our England" that, but whose behavior is anything but 
dignified. 
</P>
<P>
 The film also takes to task the way the upper crust defines insanity. After 
J.C. gives an impromptu sermon and declares that God's love "makes all men 
equal," his uncle (William Mervyn) declares, "He's not only mad, he's 
Bolshevik." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the film's rampant lunacy, some sane and sobering themes emerge, not 
the least of which is that it's better to have delusions of love than delusions 
of hate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ruling Class" (1972), directed by Peter Medak. 154 minutes. Rated PG.

SPECIAL SCREENING: FASSBINDER'S CYNICAL 'MARRIAGE' OF INCONVENIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Braun doesn't start out cynical. The heroine of "The Marriage of Maria 
Braun" is innocent and hopeful as Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1978 movie opens 
-- Hitler's war may be collapsing all around her, but she's swaddled in the 
dreams of a newlywed. 
</P>
<P>
 The optimism is fleeting. The day after her wedding, husband Hermann is sent 
to the front; Maria's honeymoon finds her visiting the train station daily 
looking for him among the wounded soldiers coming home. She wears a sign on her 
back, asking if anyone knows anything about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the occupation begins. Postwar Germany is a ruin, overrun by American 
soldiers. There's little food, no firewood and only the barest of money. Maria 
starts to turn hard, an opportunist trying to survive. She'll do just about 
anything to get ahead, and Fassbinder uses her as a symbol for a Germany trying 
to revive itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marriage of Maria Braun," screening Friday night as the latest 
installment in UC Irvine's "Off the Beaten Path" series, is an often 
unforgiving portrait of the time. Fassbinder, one of Germany's most political 
filmmakers during the '60s and '70s, is inclined to criticize, to judge. He 
recalls an era of insecurity, and comes up with a frowning assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just Fassbinder's way. One of the more pessimistic directors of his 
generation, he saw himself as a realist with not much to smile about. 
Fassbinder usually saw injustice and self-deception under the brightest of 
life's surfaces. His own end in 1982 reflected this tragic point of view. 
Fassbinder was found slumped over his editing table, a cigarette wedged between 
his fingers, apparently the victim of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria, despite all her success, is also a tragic figure. Her character is 
complicated, contradictory and often confusing (too much ambiguity is a 
recurring flaw in Fassbinder's work), but it's obvious that the director looks 
down on what she's become. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Maria sets her own course (mostly an amoral one, going from one man 
to the next without thought of the consequences for them or her husband) and 
becomes prosperous during a time when it was difficult for anybody, especially 
a woman, to get ahead, we feel she's sacrificed too much for her triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which won the Oscar for best foreign film, is interesting if only 
for the depth of Maria's cynicism. Also, her strange allegiance to Hermann 
(Klaus Lowitsch), even as he tries to understand why she claims love for him 
while satisfying her own sexual impulses elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a dispassionate, denuded quality to her couplings (and to the critical 
moments at the movie's end when she's reunited with Hermann) that speak 
forcefully about her barren nature and that of the life barely moving around 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fassbinder's metaphor for a soulless Germany, Hanna Schygulla is 
well-suited for the role. Although pretty and sensual, there's nothing carnal 
about her; she's almost an automaton in her calculated, selfish way of 
approaching things. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite this, we don't despise Maria. Schygulla evokes a trace of sympathy 
because we understand how limited her choices are. And at least Maria doesn't 
make excuses for the path she's chosen or what she's become. There's courage in 
that, no matter how perverse.

KIDS ON FILM: WESTERN HUMOR OF 'MAVERICK' IS ACES: NO BLUFFING NEEDED 
</P>

 In "Maverick," a self-deprecating dandy and flimflam man (Mel Gibson) who 
needs $25,000 to enter the "poker game of the century" in St. Louis, joins up 
with an old lawman (James Garner) and a flirtatious female gambler (Jodie 
Foster) -- both equally extroverted cons. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You know what happens when, like, your parents take you to a movie insisting 
you'll like it because they loved it when it was, you know, a TV show, light 
years before you were even born. They even try to encourage you by saying there 
will be lots of country Western music. 
</P>
<P>
 You think: Bor-ring.  
</P>
<P>
 You go, but you shift in your seat. You get up and down. You even feign sleep 
to make your point. 
</P>
<P>
 Then maybe you get a surprise.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little more than I expected," said Matthew Barros, 12, whose parents 
had planned this movie excursion for six weeks. "I thought it was pretty good 
actually. There wasn't really that much country music."  
</P>
<P>
 Most kids said they liked this witty take on the Old West, even if the comedy 
was similar to the moss-covered TV show, which ran from 1957-62.  
</P>
<P>
 The boys liked the fancy gunslinging, or as 9-year-old Joseph Roberts put it, 
"the shooting part."  
</P>
<P>
 Both genders liked the humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Harris, 15, said she liked Graham Greene ("Dances With Wolves"), who 
plays Maverick's friend, a thoroughly modern Native American who exploits his 
position as a tourist attraction for Russian adventurers. He elicited the most 
laughs from the audience when he tried to out-con Maverick by pretending to 
steal his money.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got your money right here," he says. "I just wanted to see how you'd 
react." 
</P>
<P>
 Other kids enjoyed the intricate cons and reverse cons.  
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s movie version, we also get a new vision of the Old West: aerial 
panoramas and all the yellow dust and dirt we never saw on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of corny," said Barret Bruchhauser, 14.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really get the point of the movie," said Louise Majera, also 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Ashley Louise Harris also gave it a thumbs down, saying, "Some 
of it I got tired on and falled asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 But parents can relax: The movie's sex and violence are alluded to more than 
shown, and the PG rating is fair.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that parents can easily find family movies to go to, the problem is that 
most of them are weak comedies, seemingly designed to appeal to the lowest 
common denominator. But bolstered by a strong and witty script (by William 
Goldman, who wrote "The Princess Bride" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance 
Kid"), "Maverick" not only elicited laughs but also featured suspense and plot 
twists that genuinely surprised the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew said his favorite scene was near the end, when the suspense focused on 
the final card in the final round of the high-stakes poker game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have happened either way," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He also thought it was interesting to know that the lawman was played by James 
Garner, who starred as the original Maverick. 
</P>
<P>
 Which kids would like this movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids 10 through 25," Matthew suggested. "Once you get older, the movies get a 
little more predictable. The younger ones, maybe they couldn't understand it. I 
just thought the whole movie was unpredictable. I thought it was good overall."

 The Renaissance at the Dana Point Cafe will hold its grand opening party 
Friday, featuring an appearance by the Bruce Baldwin Band, a jazz group. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, formerly Alexander's, is under new ownership by Renaissance 
Associates, which runs Renaissance Cafes in Laguna Beach and Brea and 
Renaissance Coffee in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior has been entirely renovated, said Dwight Anderson, president of 
Renaissance Associates. It includes contemporary style furniture and a 
handcrafted granite and mahogany wine bar. Entertainment is on the bill 
nightly, with an emphasis on blues and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for years as the Old Dana Point Cafe, the restaurant was renamed 
Alexander's by Pamela and Alexander McGeary, who owned it for 14 years. The 
couple sold the restaurant, which is one of the oldest buildings in Dana Point, 
to concentrate on their vineyard in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening party is from 6 to 9 p.m. and includes appetizers, beer and wine. 
A $25 fee at the door will benefit the Orange County Marine Institute, which is 
hoping to buy research equipment for its new vessel, "R/V Sea Explorer."

</P>
<P>
 Dinner starts any time between 6 and 10 p.m., and reservations are required. 
The price of $55 includes tax and tip. 
</P>

LOST IN O.C.: 'TOMMY' WAS A BIGGER SENSATION IN MY MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Poor abused, mistreated Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not thinking of the drugged, raped, beaten, sensory-deprived title 
character of Pete Townshend's "Tommy," but of the whole dang rock opera itself. 
I saw it recently in its spangly, new incarnation at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, and, boy, was it loathsome. 
</P>
<P>
 Townshend's most famous creation is certainly deserving of a new airing, 
especially since it hardly ever got its due. The original 1969 recording by the 
Who has always struck me as a rush job, with many of the tracks sounding more 
like demos than on a par with the full-blooded, creative productions that 
graced Who albums before and after it. When I interviewed singer Roger Daltrey 
a few years ago, he confirmed as much, saying that they hadn't the time or 
budget to record it as they'd wished. 
</P>
<P>
 If that first "Tommy" was too austere, all subsequent recorded versions went 
to the opposite extreme, overproduced with flatulent orchestras, synthesizers 
and guest stars. The ultimate bloat was Ken Russell's 1975 
vomit-of-consciousness film version, where sensory overload and shock value 
spewed from every scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Underproduced though the original album was, it was certainly enough . When I 
was 14, I got my copy by subscribing to Rolling Stone: The album hadn't yet 
come out, and they offered to send it free if you'd sign up for two years.  
</P>
<P>
 I'd been a Who fan since I was 10, when the unprecedented vitriol and guitar 
violence of "My Generation" came barking out of the AM radio like a rabid dog. 
A couple of years later, I thought "I Can See for Miles" was the most exciting 
thing I'd ever heard, and I'd wait for it to come on the radio so I could pound 
along with Keith Moon, using chopsticks on the silverware tray to approximate a 
snare drum.  
</P>
<P>
 By then Hit Parader magazine seemed to have a new Townshend interview every 
month. What a cool guy! Not only was he smashing guitars and exploding amps 
like a rock Godzilla, but he could cite articulate art-school reasons for doing 
so. He had ideas and opinions on everything, but what he talked about the most 
was this "rock opera" thing he was working on. And here it finally was. As I 
did with other "significant" albums of the time, I put it on my $39 G.E. 
Trimline stereo, placed the speakers one foot apart on the floor, stuck my head 
between them and was transported. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of the best mumbled rock songs, the ambitious story line left a 
lot open to interpretation. The song-crafting was miraculous, showing 
Townshend's respect for the power of rock and wondrous disregard for whatever 
conventions he broke to achieve it. "Tommy" sounded like nothing that had come 
before it, yet there was no doubting it deserved to be blaring out of every 
radio. (A friend of mine spent a summer in Spain back then and swears that in 
the convent next door to his dorm the nuns would gather around the piano to 
sing "Pinball Wizard" phonetically.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the true wonder was the way the music could take you inside. Tommy, driven 
blind, deaf and dumb by witnessing his father murder his mother's lover, enters 
a "quiet vibration land" of "musical dreams," and rather than just sing of 
them, Townshend's music took you there. That was as mind-opening as any trip, 
physical or psychedelic.  
</P>
<P>
 I thought a lot about that tiny stage, the space between those two speakers, 
as I watched the latest version of "Tommy" lumber across the Performing Arts 
Center stage with the grace of an animated corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm predisposed to like any show in that stuffed-shirt building that 
necessitates signs in the lobby warning "Strobe lights and firearms will be 
used in this performance." Firearms and speedboats would be mandatory at all 
performances there if I had my way, that and wine-drunk German shepherds 
roaming the aisles. Anything to get the joint to loosen up a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Tommy" didn't do the trick. "I'm a sensation," sang Tommy, and the 
production was indeed a sensation, bearing in mind that so also is nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 The stiff, tarted-up music was a caricature of the Who's passionate version. 
(The volume was certainly toned down, though one couldn't tell that to the 
center regulars enduring the show with their fingers in their ears.) The 
production was awash in Cracker Jack special effects, with stuff spinning and 
whirling, flashing and glittering all over the place. It was like "Tommy, the 
theme park ride." 
</P>
<P>
 New York critics had raved about this show. The center audience gave it a 
rousing ovation, even those who'd blocked their ears and one lady seated near 
me who'd been soundly asleep since the intermission. They had survived their 
first rock opera, and were glad. Good for them. Happy people are productive 
people.  
</P>
<P>
 The show depressed me for days, truly, because it had no soul. Nowhere was 
there any attempt to represent Tommy's interior journeys, or even to allow an 
opportunity for the audience to imagine them. Maybe they should have attempted 
a light show, or, far better, just left the stage in respectful darkness for a 
few moments as the music -- not this music, but the music it should have been 
-- had a chance to spark the synapses. Instead there was only an onslaught of 
special effects and soap opera dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
 Some West Coast critics who lack the discernment of their New York brethren -- 
"Hey, these rats are stupendous!" the latter often get to discern in their 
chosen city -- have taken this "Tommy" to task for that soulless-ness. I almost 
feel a little sorry for the Performing Arts Center folks. Here we needle them 
for years for lacking the vision -- which officials at other such venues 
possess -- to recognize the validity of rock and other non-classical forms. 
Then they finally bring in a big noisy rock show, and we slag it. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't feel that sorry for them, because the center is still a million 
miles from ever touching the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The instances in the past when "Tommy" did get its due were the tours when the 
Who took hold of it onstage. No props, no cast, no special effects, just four 
guys with drums, guitars and a whirling microphone thoroughly inhabiting the 
music. It was regal, anarchic, spiritual and most certainly visceral, crackling 
with energy that propelled it relentlessly to its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 And though it was a quarter-century ago that the Who set precedent by 
performing its "Tommy" in Europe's finest opera houses and New York's 
Metropolitan Opera House, it is almost beyond imagining that the Performing 
Arts Center would ever book anything so chancy, vital and alive. Getting the 
diluted stuff in predigested, secondhand packages doesn't count.

DAY TRIPPIN': A GOLDEN, DELICIOUS GETAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Julian, known by locals as "queen of the backcountry," is an idyllic frontier 
town blessed with an abundance of apple orchards and lilacs, in northeast San 
Diego County. It was founded as a gold mining town during the early 1870s and 
is said to have actually once rivaled San Diego itself for the position of 
county seat. Today, it is a town of fewer than 3,000 and the only 
state-designated Historical District in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 To get there, take California 78 from Carlsbad, which takes you through scenic 
farmland (from eastern Orange County, you can take Interstate 15 to California 
78). Once you've arrived in the area, you'll find diversions enough to last 
well beyond a three-hour tour: spectacular hikes in nearby William Heise Park, 
interesting local restaurants and a wealth of small craft shops. During the 
week is the best time to visit. On weekends, the town is crowded with tourists 
from the big city who know a good thing when they see one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 10:30: No visit to Julian would be complete without a trip to the Julian 
Pie Co., run by the Smothers family. It's one of many pie shops here in town on 
the quaint main street, and the pie they bake up is nearly perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 This is apple country, and the many varieties grown here -- Jonathan, Winesap, 
Golden Delicious and others -- have played a big part in this town's economic 
and civil history. The Smothers family relies mostly on the homey pippin to 
fill its flaky, shortening rich crust, which is just like Grandma used to make. 
(And if you're lucky, there will be sugared cookies made from the leftover 
crust, at 20 cents apiece.) 
</P>
<P>
 The shop is button-cute, with a slat-board patio in the front framed with 
lilacs and parasols, and a rear patio punctuated by swinging chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pies ($1.75 a slice, $7 and up for the whole thing) come in four 
varieties: apple, Dutch apple, natural (sugar-free) and berry apple. All are 
celestial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10:30 to 11: Looking down Main Street, you can spot the lovely Julian Hotel, a 
Victorian-style bed-and-breakfast inn built by a freed slave nearly 100 years 
ago. Normally, it is open only to guests, but on weekdays, when the hotel is 
not busy, someone will be glad to let you in and give you a tour. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an extremely well-kept place, and the many rooms, though small, all 
have four-poster beds, and each is uniquely decorated. The downstairs living 
room exudes Victorian charm: Bathrooms, generally shared by hotel guests, are 
called "necessary rooms," and there is a peaceful front porch facing the street 
where you can sit and envision the 19th Century. It's easily the best-known 
landmark in this town, and a must-see. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 11 to noon: The Julian Pioneer Museum is one more way to envision what life 
must have been like here during and after the Gold Rush days. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum houses turn-of-the-century clothing, household equipment, lace, 
weaving, pianos, taxidermy and many photos and historical records, all crammed 
into a converted brewery. It's a small museum, only 2,120 square feet, but 
somehow, an hour does not feel like enough time in here. Native American 
artifacts from local tribes are of particular interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: When was the last time you visited a gold mine? Six blocks off 
Julian's main street are the Eagle and High Peak Gold Mines, where you can 
relive history as you tour what was once an actual underground operation dating 
from the last century. 
</P>
<P>
 All tours are conducted by guides and feature views of 1,000 feet of hard-rock 
tunnel, antique engines, a rock and mineral display as well as an explanation 
of the gold-extraction process from gold-bearing quartz veins. 
</P>
<P>
 On my visit, I met visitors from Germany, New Zealand and Japan, all of whom 
seemed to know more about geology and American frontier history than anyone in 
my group. But we knew how to shop for apple cider, fried chicken and homemade 
pie, and their smugness turned to envy when they saw us unpack our basket at 
the mine's lovely little picnic area, after the tour was finished. Julian 1.

 Some wild golf on the fox network: Fred Van Allen, an L.A. Times real estate 
advertising rep, was making his first foray ever into the wilds of Orange 
County to play golf. On one hole, he hit a tee shot that landed a foot short of 
a sand bunker on Mile Square Course in Fountain Valley, then watched as a fox 
emerged from the nearby trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes after my ball," Van Allen said, "and puts it in his mouth, just like 
a dog. Then he walks about 15 feet and drops it. I thought, 'Great, he gives me 
a better lie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the critter wasn't through playing the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes about half a step," Van Allen continued, "squats over the ball and 
urinates on it. Then he looks over his shoulder at me and runs off into the lot 
next door. I was really in disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Allen disposed of the ball -- from a distance. He said: "I smacked it over 
the fence in the direction the fox went."

 Holy Terwillikers: Malcolm Willits of the Collectors Book Store in Hollywood 
sent along a photo indicating that architect Frank Gehry's startling design for 
the new Disney Concert Hall isn't so avant-garde after all. It was predated 
more than 40 years ago by the futuristic set designed for the movie "The 5,000 
Fingers of Dr. T." The latter structure was also made for music -- it's a 
castle where the evil Dr. Terwilliker operates a piano school for 500 captive 
boys.

 Obviously, she never rode to the beach with any ho-daddies: Art Vinsel of San 
Pedro, hearing that owners of woodies were meeting locally, called one hotel to 
see if the old station wagons were gathered there.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was great confusion," he reports, "and I was put on hold while the 
receptionist queried the administration -- all this after I explained what a 
woodie is: i.e., 'those wonderful old wooden-sided vehicles that were popular 
many years ago.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the hotel manager came on the line and told Vinsel she knew nothing 
about it and really doubted anyone would pick her hotel "for a display of 
covered wagons." miscelLAny:

 Glendale-based Baskin-Robbins, which once introduced a Gorbachocolate flavor

Cinnamon Almond Tax Crunch to President Clinton during his recent visit. Guess

Whitewater Chocolate.

 State Sen. Leroy F. Greene (D-Carmichael) has canceled tonight's meeting at 
which he was scheduled to discuss the Santa Ana Unified School District's 
controversial "space saver" school project. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing scheduling conflicts, Greene canceled the meeting, which was planned 
for 7 p.m. in Rancho Santiago College's Philips Hall, said Diane Thomas, 
spokeswoman for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene is a member of the State Allocation Board, which funds proposed 
space-saver projects, campuses built vertically instead of horizontally so they 
take up less area in crowded urban neighborhoods. Such schools are designed to 
avoid the need for condemnation of property to create new campuses. He also 
authored the legislation promoting space-saver schools. 
</P>

 No new meeting has been scheduled, Thomas said. JON NALICK

SCOTT HARRIS: ARE THOSE BLANK TILES BAD FOR SCRABBLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chester Collins takes his Scrabble seriously, but there are some plays he 
won't make. He says, for example, that he would never play "the famous F-word." 
</P>
<P>
 You might think of this 65-year-old Canoga Park resident as a gentleman. But 
among Scrabble cutthroats, Collins is considered a bit of an eccentric, if not 
a fool. After all, a seven-letter conjugation of that verb could earn you 50 
bonus points. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, however, Chester Collins' sensibilities won't be a handicap. 
Reacting to complaints, Hasbro Inc., its subsidiary Milton Bradley and the 
National Scrabble Assn. have announced plans to banish up to 100 words -- both 
vulgarities and ethnic and religious slurs -- from the Official Scrabble 
Player's Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 But is the gentlemanly Chester Collins pleased and grateful? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't play it," he says of the famous F-word. "But I would defend anybody's 
right to play it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you never realized that vulgarities and ethnic and religious slurs are 
perfectly legal in Scrabble. Perhap you, like me, learned Scrabble from your 
mother, and your mother, like mine, was always telling sugary lies -- about 
Santa Claus, about the Tooth Fairy, about Scrabble. Only later did I learn that 
the house rules differed from the official Scrabble rules. (I well remember how 
stunned I was when my aged grandmother, may she rest in peace, played the word 
orgy. ) 
</P>
<P>
 Mom, I suspect, would applaud Hasbro, the parent company of Milton Bradley, 
for making her seem less of a liar and more of a prophet. But across the 
nation, thousands of tournament Scrabble players like Chester Collins and other 
members of the Dee Mandeson Scrabble Club in the Valley are signing petitions 
to protest the way that what they term political correctness has invaded their 
utterly apolitical pastime. They believe that Scrabble, like speech, should be 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 To them, such an alteration to "the OSPD" is heresy. To them, it is 
"outrageous," "absurd," "awful," "a terrible situation." Ralph Crosby wonders 
whether it's a plot to sell new dictionaries and the OSPD hand-held calculator, 
which sells for $49.95. To them, a word is simply a play. The comments of 
Nellie Sanders, a librarian at Harvard Westlake School, are typical: "'Real 
Scrabble players don't care about the definitions. These are words I don't use 
in conversation, but I don't want to take them out of the dictionary. I'm a 
librarian, so I have strong feelings about censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 John Williams, the executive director of the National Scrabble Assn., finds 
himself in the middle of this dispute. The organization that sanctions Scrabble 
tournaments is funded by its 10,000 members and Hasbro. But it's obvious that 
Hasbro is calling the shots on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting to note that the OSPD has been around a long time. The 
dictionary was published 20 years ago simply by cataloguing every two-letter to 
eight-letter word in America's four most popular dictionaries. Only in recent 
years have complaints been an issue. In a March 22 letter, the Anti-Defamation 
League noted that the OSPD's inclusion of "admittedly 'offensive' terms" like 
the use of jew as a verb . . . is "literally playing games with hate." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Hasbro Inc. Vice President Donald M. Robbins wrote back. He 
said the company agreed with "the ADL's position that . . . hateful and 
demeaning epithets be retired to the recreational dustbin' " and promised to 
send a copy of the new dictionary in September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing games with hate? 
</P>
<P>
 "They are making a tempest out of a teapot," said Deborah Sapot, who is better 
at Scrabble than at metaphors. That may be true from every perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapot is director of the Dee Mandeson Scrabble Club, a group named in honor of 
a club founder who is playing in the great beyond. Sapot is Jewish, and so are 
many other club members. This is not surprising in a group that gathers every 
Monday night at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills. Yet 
players who routinely rack up 400-point games don't hesitate to play J-words, 
N-words and F-words. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Sapot points out, censorship is a slippery slope. If jew is banned as a 
verb, what about gyp ? Today, gyp is not deemed "offensive" in the OSPD, even 
though some Gypsies may not approve. 
</P>
<P>
 It all makes Chester Collins sigh. "I think that war is the most obscene word 
of all," he says. "But is it the fault of those three little letters?"

STUDY SUGGESTS COLLUSION AMONG BROKERAGE FIRMS; WALL STREET: FINDINGS BY TWO 
BUSINESS PROFESSORS INDICATE A POSSIBLE RIGGING OF TRADES ON THE NASDAQ MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new study strongly suggests that the nation's brokerage firms collude with 
each other to rig over-the-counter trading and ensure themselves artificially 
high trading profits at the expense of investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by two business professors examined price data for the stocks of 100 
large companies traded on the Nasdaq market for over-the-counter stocks, and is 
believed to be the first to examine such price data in great detail. It came up 
with the seemingly bizarre finding that for 71 of these stocks -- including 
such giant companies as Apple Computer and Lotus Development -- prices were 
almost never posted on Nasdaq in "odd eighths" such as 22 1/8, 22 3/8, 22 5/8 
and 22 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the spread between "bid" and "asked" prices -- in effect, the 
profit the brokerage firm makes on each share traded -- was almost never less 
than a quarter of a point, or 25 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, most of which was immediately condemned by Nasdaq, comes as 
criticism of the fairness of over-the-counter trading has escalated in recent 
months. It also comes at a time of fierce rivalry between the highly 
computerized Nasdaq system and exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange 
and American Stock Exchange. Nasdaq has used fairness and efficiency as a key 
point of its marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the study -- Vanderbilt University business professor William 
Christie and Ohio State University business professor Paul Schultz -- made 
copies of their report available Wednesday. Christie said it was accepted for 
publication in the next issue of the Journal of Finance, due out in about six 
months. The journal is the official publication of the American Finance Assn., 
an organization of professors who specialize in economics, business and 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The study initially examined data for the full year 1991, and then went back 
and confirmed the same results for 1994 to date, according to Christie. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard G. Ketchum, chief operating officer of the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, which operates Nasdaq, didn't dispute in an interview that 
the 71 stocks almost never trade at spreads narrower than 25 cents. But he said 
there are legitimate reasons. He said the study "is irresponsible and in fact 
we believe it is slanderous." 
</P>
<P>
 The authors emphasized that they have no conclusive proof of collusion, which 
would violate securities laws. But after analyzing and rejecting other possible 
explanations, they stated "we are unable to offer any other plausible 
explanation for the lack of odd-eighth quotes." 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that in rare instances when the stocks were quoted at such prices, 
the prices typically were posted for less than two minutes before being 
removed. The authors noted that there were several ways dealers could punish 
maverick rivals who tried to narrow the spread, including the diversion of 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Christie said he believes the Securities and Exchange 
Commission should launch an investigation of OTC trading. Brandon Becker, the 
SEC's head of market regulation, couldn't immediately be reached for comment 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street firms that are large "market makers" in OTC stocks didn't seem 
eager on Wednesday to comment on the charge of price collusion. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, said the 
firm had no comment. Prudential Securities and Smith Barney Shearson also 
didn't respond to repeated calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Securities firms in the past have maintained that the OTC market is fair and 
that spreads are needed to compensate them for the risks they take in trading 
and providing liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the highly computerized Nasdaq, the NYSE, Amex and other exchanges rely 
on a much older system in which individuals on the exchange floors, called 
specialists, match buy and sell orders. Nasdaq has contended that its system, 
in which dozens of brokerage firms linked by the computerized trading network 
make a market in the same stock at the same time, has greater competition that 
works to the benefit of investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nasdaq system, two prices are posted for each stock: the bid price and 
the asked price. The bid price is the one at which brokers are willing to buy a 
stock; the asked price is the one at which they are willing to sell. The 
difference between the two is known as the spread, and it represents the profit 
the firms make for acting as middlemen in the trades. On the Nasdaq, small 
investors can almost never obtain a stock at anything lower than the asked 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum cited a study of stock trading in Australia that, he said, shows that 
spreads in over-the-counter trading tend to gravitate naturally to a quarter 
point. He noted that many of the stocks listed on Nasdaq are more volatile and 
thinly traded than those listed on the NYSE or Amex, and said dealers may set 
wide spreads so that they can be sure of meeting all of a customer's order at 
the posted asked price. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighths of a point, or 12.5 cents, by tradition are the smallest increments at 
which prices move on stock exchanges. But the SEC, in its recent Market 2000 
report proposing changes in the nation's trading system, recommended that the 
smallest increment for all exchanges be reduced to a sixteenth of a point.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: A STARRING ROLE FOR HOLLYWOOD AGENTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know the joke. . . . The Devil approaches a Hollywood agent and offers him 
a deal: He can represent any 10 stars he desires in exchange for his immortal 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent ponders for a moment and then says, "OK -- but what's the catch?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lately the punch line may be the same, but the temptation facing today's 
super-agencies is even more lucrative. The rise of new-media technologies and 
digital networks is creating opportunities agencies haven't enjoyed in more 
than 30 years. The choices that a Creative Artists Agency, William Morris or 
International Creative Management are making now will help determine who gets 
to set tomorrow's new-media markets agenda: the studios, the cable companies, 
the Baby Bells, the software entrepreneurs or the Hollywood agencies 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceivably, agencies could become even richer and more influential in 
tomorrow's pop culture business. Or they could just as easily blow themselves 
up by cutting the wrong deals or entangling themselves in a web of conflicting 
interests that compromise their credibility as honest brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, the agencies that succeed will no longer be just agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As rich and powerful as Hollywood's super-agencies may be, they're forbidden 
-- thanks to the antitrust legacy of Jules Stein's MCA -- to produce movies or 
network television programs. Consequently, their core business is being talent 
brokers and packagers. That's a terrific business for today's media, but what 
about tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there's absolutely nothing preventing agencies from taking 
an equity position and producing a video game or a CD-ROM disc or an 
infomercial or an on-line network service or a multimedia operating system 
standard. By virtue of their relationships with the creative and technical 
worlds, the agencies have the chance not just to represent the future but to 
own a piece of it. In other words, the new media are forcing agents to choose 
whether to be merely agents or to also become principals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a definite schism about this in the agency business," says William 
Morris President Jerry Katzman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood historians may comment that new media pose precisely the same 
strategic dilemma that faced Jules Stein and the Hollywood agencies during the 
rise of network television. Agents in those days could also be producers -- and 
some were, until the government barred the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's situation is analogous. Take 3DO, for example, a once-hot but now 
troubled video game console company that aspired to set a new industry standard 
in home entertainment. Suppose an ICM or CAA had taken a 10% stake in 3DO in 
exchange for helping assure the active software development support of 
Hollywood's creative community, as well as the marketing rollout of the 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point after the company went public, that stake would have been worth 
more than $45 million. If 3DO had succeeded, the agency would have had the 
inside track -- for itself and its clients -- on the future of interactive 
multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens to Hollywood deal making when the sweet smell of success comes 
as much from equity investments as client relationships? In fact, couldn't some 
of those equity investments actually come from those longstanding client 
relationships? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is obviously a hot subject for us," Katzman says. "My own view is that 
we will always be in the agency business. That's not to say that we aren't in 
these various other businesses. We may have to reinvent ourselves and the way 
we do business." 
</P>
<P>
 William Morris does, in fact, have equity investments in a handful of 
new-media companies, ranging from digital production to infomercials, says 
Katzman. But he points out that "most of these companies are start-up 
companies; they want our ability to represent them, but they're not able to pay 
commissions at this time, so we've taken equity positions instead." 
</P>
<P>
 William Morris, he says, believes it can best represent its clients by not 
becoming principals in businesses that might compete against the studio or 
create conflicts of interest that could undermine its advisory relationships 
with clients. Should that mean slower growth, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our core business," says ICM's Jeffrey Berg, who has been outspoken in his 
description of the potential of new-media technologies to transform Hollywood, 
"we've made a decision in our agency to remain representatives and not 
principals. . . . We just did the licensing deal with Broderbund/Random House" 
-- the deal that will make Dr. Seuss interactive -- "and we probably could have 
put ourselves in the deal, but we didn't feel that was appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Berg quickly adds: "In new forms of electronic publishing like 
CD-ROM, it's likely we'll have a different role. . . . We're not really looking 
to become investment bankers, but we are rethinking the mission of the firm. 
Our agency has begun to commit substantial time and resources to begin serving 
these markets, but I don't think I can go further with you on that. We are 
rethinking ourselves now more in terms of being a communications agency, not 
just a talent and literary agency." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about stock options," insists CAA's Michael Ovitz. "This is not 
analogous to the 1960s, when talent agencies wanted to go into an existing 
business with established rules. The reality is that this window of opportunity 
is totally unique. The chance to be the connective tissue for these creative 
communities is the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 While CAA does have a few equity investments in new-media companies, Ovitz 
dismisses them as mainly trade for service, rather than being part of any 
strategic redefinition of his firm. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's clear that CAA is hoping to rewrite the traditional rules 
surrounding agents, clients and investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But fundamental issues remain: Agencies that choose solely to represent their 
clients may lose their best chance ever to influence the future of their 
industry. The agencies that choose to invest in the future run the risk of no 
longer being agencies -- of valuing equity deals over client relationships. 
They run the risk of losing their franchise in a bid to help define and own the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than who gets to own -- or run -- which studio, cable company or Baby 
Bell, how these issues get resolved will determine who reaps the rewards from 
tomorrow's new-media opportunities.

EDISON WINS OK FOR FASTER PAYMENT PLAN; ENERGY: THE PUC WILL ALLOW QUICKER 
PAYOFF OF INVESTMENTS IN TWO NUCLEAR PLANTS TO BOOST COMPETITIVENESS. ANALYSTS 
PREDICT STABLE OR LOWER CONSUMER RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an unprecedented strategy likely to be repeated around the country as 
states deregulate their electric utilities, Southern California Edison Co. won 
permission Wednesday to speed up the payoff of its investment in two nuclear 
power facilities. The move is intended to strengthen the company's financial 
posture amid looming competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Utilities Commission -- overturning the recommendations of 
consumer advocates and its own staff -- will allow Edison to increase capital 
recovery from ratepayers for its San Onofre and Palo Verde nuclear generating 
stations by $75 million a year, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very smart move, and over time it will help the utility be more 
competitive," said Edward J. Tirello Jr., a senior vice president and utilities 
analyst with NatWest Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and utility officials predict this shift will bring stable or even 
lower rates for all customers, while some consumer advocates argue that rates 
will go up. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4-1 vote, Commissioner Jessie Knight dissented, saying he does not 
consider the speed-up a "good or fair way to recover the sunk costs of Edison's 
nuclear investment." He argued that it could provide a poor incentive for cost 
control of nuclear plants and could make other parts of Edison's operations 
less competitive under deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight agreed with the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates, which presented 
an alternative to the Edison proposal using different incentives to lower 
nuclear power plants' costs. The division also argues that shareholders as well 
as ratepayers should bear the cost of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison wants to pay off the plants more quickly to lower their cost of 
producing power, making them more competitive with other utilities and 
independent power producers in a new electricity marketplace the PUC hopes to 
create in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison argued that some of its largest industrial customers could choose at 
that time to bypass the utility to buy cheaper electricity elsewhere, leaving 
smaller commercial and residential ratepayers to pay off an even larger share 
of these investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The move also lessens the chance that under any deregulation plan adopted by 
the PUC, shareholders would be asked to pick up part of the cost of nuclear 
plants or other assets that could prove uneconomical in a competitive arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC has proposed that ratepayers alone pay such transition costs, but that 
plan faces strong opposition from a variety of critics and could be amended 
before final PUC approval. 
</P>
<P>
 These uncertainties have made many stock market analysts and investors 
nervous, pummeling utility stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones utility stock index has plunged 28% from its peak last fall, 
reflecting higher interest rates and worries about the fallout from utility 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a parallel request approved Wednesday, Edison will slow down the pay-back 
of investment in other business units -- transmission and distribution -- by 
$75 million a year. This is designed to keep consumers' rates from going up.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumer groups strongly opposed the requests, contending that Edison is 
simply trying to get ratepayers to shoulder more short-term costs from what is 
becoming the riskiest side of the utility business -- expensive nuclear 
generation -- and less of the transmission side, which is less risky. While 
ratepayers, under previous PUC decisions, are paying for these investments now, 
the burden of high-cost units of the utility affects shareholders' stock prices 
and dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many analysts expect Edison to lower its current dividend in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility is "in a sense shifting the risk of operating those plants from 
their stock payers to their ratepayers," said Audrie Krause, executive director 
of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer advocacy group in San 
Francisco, " . . . the risk being that over time they are going to have to 
spend more and more money to keep them operating safely." 
</P>
<P>
 Krause accused the commission of protecting Edison from the consequences of 
its expensive foray into nuclear power and predicted higher electric bills for 
ratepayers because of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison estimates that early depreciation will reduce bills to all classes of 
ratepayers by $5 million a year and $39 million over the long term. Analysts 
predicted little or no effect on residential utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 SCEcorp shares inched up 12.5 cents to $14 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Wednesday, before the news was announced.

END OF AN ERA; CLOSURE OF BUILDING 15 SHUTS BOOK ON HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing a celebrated chapter in Southern California aerospace history, the 
aircraft plant in Culver City where Howard Hughes built the Spruce Goose five 
decades ago is scheduled to shut down this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas has built helicopter parts in the plant's cavernous 
centerpiece, Building 15, since buying Hughes Aircraft Co.'s helicopter line in 
1984. But McDonnell has been shifting that work in recent years to its main 
helicopter site in Mesa, Ariz., and its roughly 50 production workers still in 
Culver City are calling its quits when the final shift ends at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very sad for me, although all of us had known it was coming," said Betty 
Percival, who spent 21 years at the plant in administrative posts. "I almost 
wish I hadn't seen this part. On the other hand, I wouldn't have left earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes began construction on the plant in 1941, and Building 15 was completed 
in 1943 to accommodate the making of the Spruce Goose, an enormous wooden craft 
that was also known as the HK-1 Hercules Flying Boat and remains the biggest 
airplane ever built. More than two dozen other structures were eventually added 
to the 260-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the buildings -- including one that served as Howard Hughes' private 
apartment -- are already empty, and the plant's 4,500-space parking lot is 
dotted with weeds. Hughes Aircraft's original headquarters, once famed for its 
mahogany-trimmed walls, also sits vacant and rotting 18 years after the 
billionaire's death. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell's main administrative building on the plant is like a ghost town, 
its dozens of drab offices empty of people and telephones. Hundreds of 
typewriters, personal computers, desk lamps and chairs that once filled those 
rooms were auctioned off earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The factory floor in Building 15 is filled with idle metal stamping machines, 
drills, hydraulic presses and welding bays. Some are being put in crates for 
shipment to Arizona. Overhead, an enormous American flag still hangs from the 
building's rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, which once employed as many as 3,000 people, won't be entirely 
vacated until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft still inhabits two buildings at the site, where 700 workers 
make high-tech display screens for police cars and other electronic gear. But 
both McDonnell and Hughes are tenants on the property, with leases expiring at 
the end of 1994, and Hughes said its employees will leave by then as well.  
</P>
<P>
 The property, located in a three-mile corridor at the base of the Westchester 
Bluffs, is part of the massive Playa Vista project being developed by Maguire 
Thomas Partners. The company plans to transform the site into a community with 
housing, offices, stores and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to the plant now? 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Rising, a senior partner at Maguire, said the first phase calls for 
leaving the buildings there -- probably for at least five years -- and possibly 
leasing them to new tenants. He noted that a couple of the structures are 
already being used by the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, "the overall master plan calls for those (buildings) to be 
replaced as the market dictates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But R.D. (Rod) Ayers, a plant manager who arrived at the site in 1969, said it 
would be a shame to tear down Building 15.  
</P>
<P>
 It "is a historical site," Ayers said. "The biggest aircraft in the whole 
world was built right in that building over there." 
</P>
<P>
 The plant's demise ends a unique era: Everything about it reinforced Howard 
Hughes' legend as a bigger-than-life innovator. 
</P>
<P>
 Building 15, as long as 2 1/2 football fields, with a ceiling eight stories 
high, was thought to be the world's largest wooden structure when it was 
finished, according to Hal Klopper, a McDonnell public relations official and 
the plant's unofficial historian. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the hangar, and most of the other structures, were painted what 
became known as "Hughes green." Old-timers still debate whether Hughes used the 
color because he liked it or because it was postwar surplus and cheap. Building 
15 was later covered with aluminum siding to protect the wood, and McDonnell 
painted the structure powder blue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spruce Goose -- a label Hughes despised because the plane was actually 
made mostly of birch -- was 218 feet long and 79 feet high. With Hughes at the 
controls, the aircraft made its first and only flight over Los Angeles Harbor 
in late 1947. The plane later was on display in Long Beach, until it was moved 
to Oregon last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant also included the world's longest privately owned runway -- nearly 
two miles -- where Hughes again piloted an experimental plane one day in July, 
1946, before he crashed in Beverly Hills and was nearly killed. The runway was 
closed in 1986 and its pavement has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, legions of Hughes workers built more than 6,000 military and 
commercial helicopters, aircraft parts and weapons in Culver City, particularly 
during the Korean and Vietnam wars. At times they even manufactured wooden 
rowboats and pinball machines. 
</P>
<P>
 One corner of the plant also served as the backdrop to the 1984 movie "Swing 
Shift," which centered around a World War II aircraft plant. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the years rolled by, stories of the eccentric Howard Hughes -- true or 
not -- continued to be handed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers, though he never met him, recalled how Hughes ordered his staff to place 
two pairs of new white socks in a specific desk drawer, because Hughes often 
arrived wearing sneakers but no socks. The socks were never used, but they 
remained in the desk until Hughes died, Ayers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades later, the plant Hughes built is a casualty of the cutbacks in U.S. 
defense spending, and for the workers "there's certainly sadness, because you 
remember all of the good times," Ayers said. "But those are gone. It's part of 
business. Nothing can go on forever."

BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE AS MEXICAN, U.S. GOVERNORS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the North American Free Trade Agreement now in effect, the annual meeting 
of U.S. and Mexican border state governors will begin in Phoenix today with a 
strong undercurrent of competition, unlike the neighborly atmosphere of past 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Governors Conference begins as member states on both sides of the 
Rio Grande are competing for billions of dollars in funds to finance a host of 
proposed NAFTA -- related transportation and environmental projects. Those 
projects -- to be funded by the U.S. government and the World Bank -- translate 
into jobs and economic benefits that politicians everywhere are eager to go 
after. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the governors of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas and their 
six Mexican counterparts are accentuating their fraternity, their staff members 
admit that the leaders intend to size up the competition for projects, which 
range from a sewage treatment plant in San Diego to telecommunications links in 
Nogales to interstate highway funds in Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle will be who gets the money and who has the best proposals," said 
Rudy Fernandez, director of California-Mexico affairs in the state's Trade and 
Commerce Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California may already be at a competitive disadvantage, at least in 
generating cooperation from Mexican governors. That's because Gov. Pete 
Wilson's use of illegal immigration as a political issue has offended many 
Mexicans as well as Mexican Americans, observers said. Wilson is scheduled to 
attend the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 To fully maximize NAFTA-related business, the states must build the 
infrastructure -- roads, bridges, sewers, environmental controls, border 
checkpoints and communications links -- to make themselves attractive to 
business. And to do that, they need help from Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 A big chunk of the federal aid targeted by the states was created by NAFTA 
itself. To get the trade bill past environmental interests in Congress, the U.S 
and Mexican governments agreed to fund billions of dollars' worth of 
environmental projects through a new North American Development Bank, or 
NADBank, headquartered in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the decisions on which environmental projects to fund will be the new 
Border Environmental Cooperation Commission based in El Paso, also created by a 
side deal to NAFTA, which will be responsible for evaluating and prioritizing 
environmental project proposals.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Texas got most of the NAFTA bureaucracy and some jobs when it snared 
the headquarters of NADBank, BECC and three other NAFTA-related agencies, the 
project dollars are still very much up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California's activity on NAFTA planning issues has fallen short of other 
states' efforts, said Charles E. Nathanson, executive director of San Diego 
Dialogue, a regional public policy think tank at UC San Diego that studies 
border issues. Nathanson said Wilson has shown a lack of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson is at a disadvantage, image-wise, because of his strong stand against 
illegal immigration. But while other governors are using the force of their 
personalities to energize cross-border exchanges -- thinking that it will have 
big payoffs down the road -- Gov. Wilson is not," Nathanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill George, a state Trade and Commerce Agency assistant secretary, disagreed, 
noting that Wilson has established an "aggressive export finance program" and a 
new office for California-Mexican affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good record and certainly believe that California is positioned as 
well as anyone to take advantage not only of NAFTA, but other trade agreements 
as trade is liberalized throughout the world," George said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While in a competitive posture, the governors still must cooperate in some 
areas to take full advantage of NAFTA. For example, they and their staffs 
exchange ideas on how to accommodate the huge increase in border vehicle 
traffic that NAFTA is expected to generate. Texas and Arizona, for example, may 
use a recent increase in federal funds to build "trade corridors," or 
interstate highway extensions to facilitate traffic north from their borders.

daily flights to the San Francisco Bay Area.Southwest, based in Ft. Worth, 
Tex., will offer seven daily flights to Oakland and eight to San Jose for an 
unrestricted one-way price of $69. Advance-purchase discounts could cut the 
price to as low as $49 one way. Airlines competing with Southwest on routes to 
Oakland and San Jose say they will match the fares. "Orange County typically 
has higher average fares than Los Angeles," said Dave Messing, a spokesman for 
Continental Airlines. "Signs are now that is changing."

 Colorado Again Rated Tops in Economy, Growth Potential: With Colorado leading 
the way, eight states made the latest annual honor roll for their ability to 
strengthen their economies and their potential for future growth, a private 
research group said. The Corporation for Enterprise Development, a private 
research group, said Colorado won A's in each of the three major categories: 
economic performance, business vitality and development capacity.The state was 
the 1993 winner as well, with two A's and a B. Others making the honor roll 
with at least two A's or Bs and no grade lower than C were Delaware, Minnesota, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and Washington. West Virginia ranked 
at the bottom of the class, with all Fs, and California was one of four states 
that got Fs in economic performance.

 Philip Morris Fails to Split Units: The board considered splitting the 
company's food and tobacco businesses, but took little action.The directors 
instead promoted two executives, so that for the first time in years tobacco 
and food will have equal heads reporting to the top executive. "That's not as 
good as I was hoping," said tobacco analyst Becky Barfield of CS First Boston. 
"It could be significant that they named those two guys. It could be the first 
step toward a split. I just don't know." Geoffrey Bible, executive vice 
president, was named a director and vice chairman for worldwide tobacco. 
William Murray, a director, president and chief operating officer, was 
appointed vice chairman for worldwide food.

 Big Three to Build Joint Paint Plant: Trying to sharply reduce air emissions 
from vehicle painting, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. 
said they joined forces to build a $20-million facility to test a new 
generation of powdered paints.The Low Emissions Paint Consortium, formed by the 
three auto makers, will build the pilot facility at Ford's assembly plant in 
Wixom, Mich. It will be used to test a new type of powdered clear-coat paint 
starting in late 1995. The 60,000-square-foot facility will be operated by ABB 
Paint Finishing Inc., a unit of Swiss-Swedish engineering group Asea Brown 
Boveri. Powder paints may become the auto industry's future paint technology.

 Fed Downplays Derivatives Risk: Derivatives dealings by banks and securities 
firms are unlikely to lead to losses requiring a taxpayer bailout, Federal 
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said.That's not to say the derivatives 
market is without risks, Greenspan told a House hearing. Perhaps the greatest 
danger would result from Congress passing ill-conceived regulations that harm 
the $12-trillion market, making it more difficult for major corporations to 
shed some of their financial risk, he suggested. The risk of overzealous 
regulation could result in "a stagnant economy," Greenspan said. Congress is 
concerned because the complex financial contracts have been linked to a string 
of multimillion-dollar losses at corporations in recent weeks.

NEWS ANALYSIS; IBM'S AGENCY MOVE PROBABLY WON'T BE CLONED; MARKETING: FEW BIG 
ADVERTISERS WILL PLACE THEIR ACCOUNTS WITH ONE FIRM, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 International Business Machines is known for many things, but marketing genius 
isn't one of them, ad executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one reason why other big marketers are generally not expected to 
follow IBM's action to consolidate advertising business under one agency. The 
computer giant announced Tuesday that it fired 40 ad agencies and consolidated 
its estimated $450-million advertising business with Ogilvy & Mather, a moved 
that shocked Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-saving considerations -- and a tendency by major marketers to 
increasingly try to advertise globally under a single brand image -- may 
eventually result in some firms giving the biggest agencies larger slices of 
their overall ad business. In some cases, that is already taking place at 
companies such as AT&T and Nissan Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But ad industry and marketing executives say they do not see major advertisers 
summarily following IBM's agency blood-letting. Rather, most say, today's 
complex and costly marketing environment will likely result in big advertisers 
continuing to use multiple agencies as the best way of marketing numerous 
products in many countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will not say, 'Gee, IBM is doing it so maybe we should do it,' " said 
Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at the New York investment firm PaineWebber. "IBM 
is not recognized as the paragon of marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 With its unexpected move, IBM reversed its own strategy of recent months under 
which it had actually been adding agencies to its roster. (No Los Angeles 
agencies directly handled IBM advertising.) 
</P>
<P>
 By hiring a mammoth Manhattan agency, some say IBM may be making precisely the 
wrong move. 
</P>
<P>
 "IBM is going to the mainframe of ad agencies when everyone else is going to 
the PCs," said Peter Sealey, former head of global marketing for Coca-Cola and 
now president of Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Interactive Network. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sealey oversaw Coke's advertising two years ago, the soft drink giant 
turned away from giant McCann-Erickson for its commercials and turned instead 
to the untested Beverly Hills talent firm Creative Artists Agency, which 
proceeded to create most of Coke's TV spots. At the time, Sealey said, Creative 
Artists created 24 commercials at less expense to Coke than eight commercials 
created by McCann. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some agency chiefs suggest that, ultimately, actions like Coke's and IBM's 
will both be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how many trends we want to invent," said Ed Wax, chairman of 
Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, "clients will ultimately do whatever 
they believe fills their needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although AT&T has recently consolidated some of its ad business, the company 
still has dozens of ad agencies worldwide. And it has no intention of asking 
one agency to handle all of its business, spokesman John Skalko said. "If you 
spread your business around a number of agencies, you keep them all on their 
toes." 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM executives contend that agency competition caused disharmony. "Our 
experience found that to be a big distraction," said Abby K. Kohnstamm, vice 
president for corporate marketing at IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Although taking on such a huge client as IBM will certainly strain Ogilvy, the 
agency already has offices worldwide and will centralize the business in its 
New York office. So the real issue at hand is adding to staff -- a problem 
somewhat mitigated by the fact that agency layoffs in recent years have 
resulted in the immediate availability of plenty of top talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking on such a huge client can, however, change the culture of an ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice agency Chiat/Day was transformed from a creative boutique to a 
mega-agency when it picked up the $150-million ad business for Nissan in 1987. 
Since then, it has added nearly $200 million in additional Nissan business, 
including Nissan's Infiniti division. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, Chiat/Day added 200 employees, said Bob Wolf, chairman of 
Chiat/Day's North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
 A single ad agency, however, will not necessarily solve IBM's problems, Wolf 
said. "Unless the client and agency are singing from the same song sheet, it 
doesn't matter," he said.

HIGHER RATES PUT A BRAKE ON HOME SALES; ECONOMY: APRIL LEVEL STILL HIGHEST IN 
FIVE YEARS FOR CALIFORNIA. ANALYSTS SAY NATIONAL RECOVERY HAS SLOWED TO 
SUSTAINABLE PACE. 
</P>

<P>
 Rising interest rates kept home sales in California and the rest of the United 
States from growing even hotter last month and put a damper on factory orders 
for big-ticket goods, as the economy showed some early signs of a slower -- but 
healthy -- second half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales in California remained at their highest level in five years in 
April, the California Assn. of Realtors said Wednesday, and prices rose as the 
supply of homes for sale dwindled.Analysts said sales might have moved even 
higher if mortgage rates had not jumped nearly 1 1/2 percentage points in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales across the country eked out a modest 1.2% gain, the National Assn. 
of Realtors said in a separate report.  
</P>
<P>
 And in a third report, the Commerce Department said a sharp drop in the 
production of autos and steel limited durable-goods orders to a modest 0.1% 
increase in April from March. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts said the three reports paint a picture of a healthy economy 
whose growth is slowing to a more sustainable rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy can't run 90 miles an hour forever," said Robert Dederick, chief 
economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "It looks like the stage is being 
set for very nice but reasonable growth in the second half of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Although California's home-resale rate in April was virtually identical to 
that of March, it was 30% faster than a year ago, the state's realty trade 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price of a home in the state rose a sharp 1.1% to $185,230 last 
month. Durable Goods

L.A. READER HOPES TO DRAW MORE ADS AS A MAGAZINE; PUBLISHING: THE MOVE AGAINST 
RIVAL LA WEEKLY COMES AS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ADVERTISING MARKET IS 
STIRRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Reader is going undercover. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with today's issue, a glossy color cover is being added to the 
alternative weekly newspaper, which will now call itself a magazine. The rest 
of the publication will continue to be printed on newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is an attempt by the 16-year-old Reader to attract advertisers -- 
including nationwide accounts -- by separating itself from its successful 
rival, LA Weekly, a tabloid so fat with advertising that it is usually more 
than twice as thick as the Reader. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry consultants say many advertisers are attracted to magazines because 
readers often keep them a week or more longer than they do newspapers. The 
format change comes at a time when a growing number of Southern California 
advertisers are starting to increase ad spending as the local economy heats up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bid for respect," said James Vowell, editor and publisher of the 
Reader. "It is a competitive tactic against LA Weekly, and it gives advertisers 
a little extra bang for their buck in an economy coming out of a recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at LA Weekly voiced little concern -- and some skepticism -- about 
the Reader's format change. "Just being a magazine won't do it," said Michael 
Sigman, publisher of LA Weekly. "It all depends on how good the magazine is." 
</P>
<P>
 LA Weekly, also 16 years old, has no intention of changing its format, Sigman 
said. "We are a newspaper and will remain one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reader -- which, like LA Weekly, is distributed free -- will raise ad 
rates about 5% along with the format change, Vowell said. The Reader's 
circulation will remain about 90,000, about half of LA Weekly's. While LA 
Weekly generally focuses on hard news and social issues, the Reader is more an 
offbeat guide to entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of being the No. 2 alternative newspaper in the market, they'll now 
be able to call themselves the No. 1 alternative magazine," said Cary Zel, an 
industry consultant at Miami-based Robert Cohen Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that several other alternative publications have tried to 
impress advertisers and readers by converting to magazine format. Rolling 
Stone, for example, was originally printed as a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The gay-and-lesbian-oriented Advocate was published as a tabloid for years 
before it was converted to a magazine format in 1985. The Advocate's new look 
did indeed help attract new advertisers, said Sam Watters, publisher of the Los 
Angeles-based magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the end," he said, "it's the editorial content that does it, no matter 
how you gloss it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The fine line separating a magazine from a newspaper keeps getting thinner, 
said Anne Russell, editor of the New York-based trade magazine Folio. "We 
debate that question every day around here."  
</P>
<P>
 A number of publications, from Learning Annex class guides to an array of 
monthly real estate guides, look like magazines because they have glossy 
covers, Russell said. But she considers only publications that have detailed 
reader databases -- and are distributed by mail -- to be true magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Vowell, whose Burnside Group purchased the then-financially strapped Reader in 
1989, said his redesigned publication is now a magazine not just because of its 
new cover, but also because of its magazine-like content. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put out a very good newspaper for 16 years, and now we'll put out a very 
good magazine," Vowell said. "If we put it in the right package, maybe people 
will appreciate it more."

 Wal-Mart Under Pressure to Change Slogan: An advertising review board told the 
nation's largest retailer to change its slogan -- "Always the low price. 
Always." -- because it doesn't ring true.The National Advertising Review Board, 
a self-regulating mechanism of the advertising industry, said it is seeking the 
change so Wal-Mart Stores Inc. can avoid implying that its prices are always 
the lowest. Wal-Mart, in a statement filed with the panel, said it disagrees 
with the decision but will voluntarily modify its advertising slogan over the 
next several months. Company officials were not immediately available to 
comment. The panel said its decision concludes an appeal by local Better 
Business Bureaus and several Wal-Mart competitors, including Dayton Hudson 
Corp.'s Target Stores Inc.

Bros. stores worldwide, including 57 stores and 26 outlets in the United 
States.

COMMODITIES FALL AGAIN; BONDS RALLY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Commodity markets were hit by heavy profit taking for a second day Wednesday, 
helping to ease inflation fears and spark a small rally in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market also edged higher, with the Dow Jones industrials adding 
10.13 points to 3,755.30. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Europe, stocks and bonds suffered a major selloff on worries that 
interest rates have bottomed. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. trading, commodities stole the spotlight as the recent surge in prices 
of grains, oil, coffee and other raw materials reversed in widespread selling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 key commodities, which hit a 3 
1/2-year high of 238.36 on Monday, plunged 3.10 points, or 1.3%, to 231.59 on 
Wednesday. The index lost 3.67 points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasts for more rain in the dry Midwest pummeled soybean prices. At the 
Chicago Board of Trade, July soybean futures fell 20 cents to $6.75 a bushel, 
on top of Tuesday's 37-cent drop. 
</P>
<P>
 A monthlong decline in beef prices gathered momentum as cattle and hog prices 
dropped sharply. Profit takers also clipped coffee, copper and oil futures. 
</P>
<P>
 And in precious metals trading, June gold futures edged down 50 cents to 
$386.80 an ounce on the Comex, and June silver fell 6.4 cents to $5.54. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many analysts were cautious about calling an end to the bull market in 
raw materials, arguing that this week's selling was an overdue correction. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a broader perspective, the CRB index has been rallying since August, 1992, 
when it made a low of 198.17. . . . The technical factors are still bullish," 
said Jake Bernstein, president of MBH Commodity Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodities' losses were bonds' gain Wednesday: Interest rates were lower 
across the board. The 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 7.36% from 7.40% on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping bonds was good demand at the Treasury's auction of $11 billion in 
five-year notes. The top yield on the notes was 6.78%, and the Treasury 
received 2.9 bids for each note sold, which was above average. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some analysts were disappointed that bonds' rally wasn't more substantial, 
considering the government's report that orders to U.S. factories for durable 
goods inched up just 0.1% in April -- suggesting a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, most broad indexes closed marginally higher in slow 
trading. Winners topped losers by 11 to 10 on the Big Board, where the 
composite index added 0.66 point to 252.06. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks gained just 0.60 point to 
732.07. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts say action in stocks is likely to dwindle today and Friday, as 
the long holiday weekend approaches and traders depart early. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, meanwhile, stocks and bonds posted large losses as investors 
focused on the possibility that short-term interest rates aren't going lower. 
</P>
<P>
 A ballooning German money supply and recent comments by Bundesbank President 
Hans Tietmeyer and central council member Reimut Jochimsen convinced investors 
that further cuts in German interest rates aren't on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Bundesbank canceled a bond auction Wednesday because bids were too 
low -- the first time the German central bank has pulled a bond sale in a 
decade. The news helped send bond yields surging in Germany, France and 
England, undercutting stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX stock index slumped 39.95 points to 2,158.77 after 
falling 50.93 points Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, the CAC index dropped 48.91 points to 2,084.41, led by Euro-Disney 
shares, which slid 15%. London's FTSE-100 index sank 68.4 points to 3,020.70, 
its lowest level since September. 
</P>
<P>
 In the London bond market, the yield on benchmark 15-year government issues 
jumped to 8.37% from 8.18% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only the beginning," warned Nick Knight, equity strategist at Nomura 
Research Institute Ltd. He fears that European bond and stock markets are 
poised for a sharp decline, similar to what U.S. markets endured earlier this 
year when the Federal Reserve Board began to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks in Tokyo, by contrast, had a decent session after investors were 
encouraged by a compromise in U.S.-Japanese trade talks. The Nikkei index 
finished up 41.51 points at 20,663.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Mexico City's Bolsa index added 3.64 points to 2,472.16, its seventh 
consecutive gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues that gained included Dow Chemical, up 1 1/4 to 69; 
Chrysler, up 7/8 to 49 5/8; Monsanto, up 1 3/4 to 81 3/4, and Harnischfeger, up 
7/8 to 19 3/8. But Deere lost 1 1/4 to 70 3/8, continuing to slide on worries 
about 1995 profit growth. 
</P>

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: FLIGHT ATTENDANTS LOBBY FOR CLEANER AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the perennial concerns of people who fly frequently has been the 
quality of the air they breathe in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, most complaints centered on discomfort caused by dry air. 
Five years ago, the primary complaint was from breathing secondhand smoke, 
which led Congress in 1990 to ban smoking on all flights shorter than six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, concerns have focused on environmental hazards, ranging 
from air pollutants to the risk of getting a communicable illness. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before Congress last week, Federal Aviation Administration 
officials supported recent studies showing that cabin air is healthful to 
breathe. However, the Assn. of Flight Attendants, a 33,000 member union, 
continues to press Congress for legislation to set higher standards for fresh 
air in planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The union argues that fresh air contains fewer contaminants, including 
airborne viruses and bacteria, than does recirculated air. In addition, the 
group believes that by changing the air in the plane more frequently, the risk 
of disease-causing organisms or fumes being inhaled by passengers will be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) 
have introduced a bill that would set a standard for the amount of fresh air 
reaching passengers and crew in the cabin, as well as establish a toll-free 
phone number for reporting air quality problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are currently no federal minimum standards for the amount of fresh air" 
in aircraft cabins, said Chris Witkowski, a spokesman for the Assn. of Flight 
Attendants. However, there are standards for the cockpit, where pilots are 
required to be alert at all times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased attention to air quality is due in part to a change in the way 
newer aircraft ventilate their cabins, said David Stempler, executive director 
of the International Airline Passengers Assn., a Washington-based group that 
represents 110,000 passengers. Aircraft built at least 15 years ago circulate 
100% fresh air throughout the cabin, whereas newer ones use a combination of 
fresh and recycled cabin air. 
</P>
<P>
 This change, along with a reduction in the number of times the air in the 
cabin is replaced with fresh air, has raised concerns that the level of 
contaminants in aircraft air is higher than it was before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. of Flight Attendants said anecdotal evidence of crew members' 
symptoms -- such as dizziness, headaches, nausea and feelings of disorientation 
-- has been increasing, although the union has not officially tracked the 
number of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such complaints, the FAA and the airline industry have mounted 
several studies over the past five years to look at air quality on aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, for example, the Air Transport Assn., a Washington-based trade 
organization that represents airlines, released the results of its "Airline 
Cabin Air Quality Study." The study, conducted by independent testing agency 
Consolidated Safety Services Inc., sampled air on 35 flights of various lengths 
on eight major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampling took place on four types of aircraft, both newer and older models. 
The tests measured carbon dioxide, temperature, relative humidity, noise, 
volatile organic compounds and particulates. The company also took samples to 
identify bacterial and fungal contaminants.  
</P>
<P>
 Results showed that "levels of contaminants found in airline cabins are not 
likely to cause adverse health effects" and that "both generations of aircraft 
exceed the requirements for maintaining a healthy air quality environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the study found that levels of carbon dioxide, a byproduct of 
breathing that can cause symptoms such as lethargy, dizziness and rapid heart 
rate at high concentrations, were lower than those found in other indoor 
settings, such as shopping malls or office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In his recent testimony before Congress, Jon Jordan, the federal air surgeon 
for the FAA, reviewed results of that study and two other reports -- a 1989 
study conducted for the FAA and the Department of Transportation and a 1991 
study conducted by the National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health. 
They also found that levels of airborne contaminants and other pollutants were 
beneath federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA therefore believes that current ventilation systems maintain healthful 
air on planes, said Hank Verbais, a spokesman for the FAA's Western Pacific 
Region. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the perception that the air in the enclosed space of an airliner 
contains unhealthful levels of particulates and other compounds remains. The 
Assn. of Flight Attendants believes it is a safety issue, because the safety of 
passengers depends on flight attendants functioning without impairment in an 
emergency. And the FAA continues to get calls from concerned passengers. The 
Airline Passengers Assn., however, said it is no longer a major issue for its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A more alarming issue for passengers who fly overseas is the practice at some 
international airports of using pesticides to decontaminate planes, Stempler 
said. Fear of introducing insects that could damage crops is the motivation, 
but the practice, which the Airline Passengers Assn. is currently 
investigating, has raised health concerns among its members.

 I bought a discounted round-trip ticket to visit my sisters in Vermont and 
Connecticut. I did not discover until I was getting my baggage ready for the 
return flight from Vermont that I did not have my return ticket.I phoned my 
sister in Connecticut and she confirmed that the ticket was there. She read the 
numbers off to me and I subsequently called the airline and confirmed my 
flight. However, when we reached the terminal, they would not acknowledge that 
I had had a ticket, even though I gave them the ticket numbers. While I argued 
with them -- they wanted me to purchase a full-fare, one-way return ticket -- 
my other sister whispered in my ear, "Don't argue; write out a check and you 
can cancel it after you get home!" Which is exactly what I did. In the 
meantime, my sister in Connecticut mailed my ticket to me. I wrote a letter to 
the airline explaining why I canceled the check and enclosed my ticket. They, 
in turn, wrote me a very apologetic letter and said they were sorry for my 
inconvenience.

 China to Remove Some Import Controls: On the eve of a trip to Europe and the 
United States to discuss China's bid to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, Assistant Trade Minister Long Yongtu said Beijing is abolishing 
import quotas and license requirements for 195 goods in a bid to bring its 
trade system closer to international standards. Import controls on 30 items 
will be lifted by year's end and the rest by the end of 1995, Long said.

 Austria appears to have weathered the recession in Europe better than its 
neighbors, thanks to improved production, a small rise in domestic demand and 
increased exports to Eastern Europe, the Far East and the United States. 
Unemployment last year was 6.8%, compared to double-digit rates in most of 
Western Europe.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; SHORTAGES AMONG COFFEE-GROWING NATIONS DRIVE PRICES 
HIGHER; COMMODITIES: THE COLLAPSE OF A 1989 INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCORD HAS BEEN 
EXACERBATED BY WOEFUL HARVESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like someone who's had too many cups, world coffee markets are wired these 
days with the price of beans rocketing higher, thanks to worsening shortages in 
Colombia, Brazil and the other big coffee-producing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The commodity price of whole, unroasted beans has roughly doubled since last 
summer, with the latest surge occurring in the past week. And coffee experts 
say prices could double again before it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic rise -- which was predicted long ago by coffee-growing nations as 
the inevitable result of the collapse of an international cartel in 1989 -- is 
described as a cyclical response to the low prices that prevailed just a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When prices tumble as they did steadily from 1989 to 1993, growers save money 
by skimping on fertilizers and other agricultural practices, opening the door 
to crop disease and infestations that can slash the size of crops for years. 
Shortages follow, bidding prices back up. 
</P>
<P>
 That and this season's late Indonesian harvest had more to do with the surge 
in prices than did a recent scheme by 28 coffee-growing nations to withhold 
beans from the market, said Judith Ganes, a coffee analyst at Merrill Lynch in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 As production fell and consumption remained flat, estimated stockpiles have 
tumbled by half, Ganes said, triggering a classic supply-demand reaction in 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last July, the average world price of a pound of green, or 
unroasted, coffee beans stood at 52 cents. On Wednesday, the price stood at 
$1.28 a pound. Ganes predicted that the price will exceed $2 within four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "What matters right now is there aren't enough beans, and the growers won't be 
able to recoup before 1995 or 1996," Ganes said. "I think the bull market is 
just starting." 
</P>
<P>
 Though good news for those members of the lately toothless coffee growers' 
cartel that have beans to sell, it spells trouble for coffee's "Big Three" -- 
Procter & Gamble, Kraft/General Foods and Nestle -- as they struggle to hold 
the line on retail prices and limit the further loss of customers to pricey, 
higher- quality gourmet blends. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little impact at the supermarket level until this week, when General 
Foods, which distributes the Maxwell House brand, raised its price to grocers 
by 25% to about $2.50 for a regular can. That is sure to cause a spike in 
retail prices and risk a further loss of market share, said Tom Pirko, 
president of Santa Barbara-based Bevmark Inc., an international beverage 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirko said the high-volume roasters -- purveyors of such name brands as 
Folger's and Maxwell House -- are plagued by razor-thin profit margins. Until 
now they have held the line on prices to hang on to customers who might 
otherwise opt for the gourmet coffees. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the makers of the cheaper canned coffees have started to boost retail 
prices to avoid losses, Pirko said, the trendy gourmet firms typified by 
Seattle-based Starbucks could grab still more market share by keeping current 
prices and forgoing some of the generous profit margins they now enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, are they smart enough to know that?" Pirko said. "Their 
margins are enormous. They could absorb much bigger (green bean price) 
increases than we've seen so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's volatility has its roots in the 1989 breakup of the International 
Coffee Agreement, a pact among 50 producing countries and 21 consuming nations, 
including the United States. The agreement set export quotas aimed at keeping 
prices stable. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. support of the agreement stemmed from coffee's importance to the 
economies of dozens of nations, including about 25 million jobs in Brazil, 
Colombia, Kenya and Indonesia. Of particular concern was Colombia, where the 
United States favored the bolstering of a farm export that might otherwise be 
replaced by illegal plantings of marijuana and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nations couldn't agree on further quotas, and the breakup of the pact 
sent world prices into a tailspin and cut deeply into revenues of the 
coffee-growing nations. Repeated efforts to reach a new agreement have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, the 28 biggest producing nations, excluding Mexico, declared an 
agreement to begin withholding 20% of their exports as of Oct. 1, and prices 
began to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite today's claims of success by Brazilian and Colombian coffee 
negotiators, most outside experts say prices were destined to surge even 
without the so-called retention scheme. The proof lies in the continuing rise 
since the program, having already exceeded its price targets, was called off in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the biggest coffee importer, the United States, last year dropped 
its support of any coffee quota system, making such export controls difficult 
to maintain. The coffee cartel needs the cooperation of consuming nations to 
keep the exporters honest by monitoring the flow of imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, the surge in prices is especially welcome in Colombia, the 
No. 2 producer, where trees have been hard hit by disease. Coffee production 
fell from 17 million bags to 13.6 million in the past year. About 150,000 acres 
of coffee trees were eradicated to make room for more profitable crops, such as 
fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all commodities that consumers can get along without, there will be a 
self-correction, even if some people are willing to pay $6 to $9 for a pound of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as steep as the recent price hike has been, today's levels, unadjusted 
for inflation, merely return prices to the $1-to-$1.50 range that prevailed 
during most of the 1980s. A price spike to $2 at the start of 1986 was 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Fred Gray of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural 
Service said: "Coffee's not an absolute necessity. If prices get too high, 
people will switch to tea or something else."

Pharmacia, a maximum 47.5 million to domestic investors, to bring in $1.3 
billion, the Financial Times reported. The remaining shares will be sold to 
international investors, raising foreign ownership in the company to more than 
15%, from 6%. The government said it will keep 10.1% of the company's voting 
shares.

 EC to Investigate Air France Restructuring Plan: The European Commission said 
it will investigate the French government's plans to inject $3.56 billion into 
Air France to determine if the aid would violate European Union rules.The 
investigation would focus in part on whether the aid would harm competition. 
Under the restructuring plan announced in March to make Air France profitable, 
the state-owned carrier has agreed to slash 12% of its work force and freeze 
wages until 1996. Meanwhile, the French government said it will change Air 
France's corporate structure in order to distribute shares to employees as 
dividends and to compensate for pay cuts and other concessions.

 Britain's GDP Up From 1993: Gross domestic product grew 0.7% in the first 
quarter of 1994 from the final quarter of 1993, giving a year-on-year growth 
rate of 2.6%, the Central Statistical Office said. Excluding oil and gas 
output, the economy grew by 0.6% in the first quarter and 2% year-on-year. 
Economists said growth was on target to hit the government's 2.5% forecast for 
1994, though some were still concerned about the likely effect of April's tax 
increases on consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of 
British GDP.

COUNTY LIBRARY REPORT IS GRIM READING; SERVICES: GRAND JURY SAYS NEW BUDGET 
CUTS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO BRANCH CLOSURES AND MAY IMPERIL THE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Still reeling from last year's devastating budget cuts, the Orange County 
library system will likely close some of its 27 branches next year because of 
severe funding shortages, according to an Orange County Grand Jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood that library branches will have to close is a virtual 
certainty," grand jury officials stated. "The future of the library system is 
in hands of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors took the unusual step of urging residents to communicate their concerns 
to the County Board of Supervisors, printing the names and office telephone 
numbers of all five board members on the cover of their report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conventional wisdom is that the current regime cannot continue for long 
before the system degrades to a point where the facilities have little utility 
as libraries," states the report, which was released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 By next year, library officials expect a budget of $18 million, or $9 million 
less than what was allocated two years ago. Last year alone, more than $6 
million was cut from the library budget, forcing a 40% reduction in service 
hours, the elimination of 75 full-time positions and a 75% cut in new book and 
magazine purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's shortfalls were prompted by a state-mandated shift of local 
property tax money to pay for the California public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury characterized last year's budget process as "tantamount to 
hocking everything to cover a couple of mortgage payments." 
</P>
<P>
 In a tour of six local branches, grand juror Bob Duley said, the panel saw "a 
general degradation of all the facilities" they visited. 
</P>
<P>
 "The periodical shelves, where you would expect to see publications of all 
kinds, are half empty," Duley said Wednesday. "Computer equipment is down and 
not functioning, and there is not much maintenance. . . . It is a grim thing. I 
don't know where the money is going to come from. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no specific branches have been identified for possible closure, 
County Librarian John M. Adams said that, unfortunately, the grand jury has 
provided an accurate portrayal of the system's poor financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that we have suffered a devastating loss of revenue," 
Adams said. "It really is a terrible situation. The only bright spot, and it 
really isn't one, is that other systems are doing even worse than we are." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, for example, Adams said that officials might have to 
close at least 50 of the 80 remaining branch libraries because of similar 
funding shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Adams is placing much hope in the work of a 15-member 
library task force recently created by the Board of Supervisors to recommend 
new sources of revenue for the faltering system. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is expected to complete its report within the next several 
weeks, but Adams said officials already are considering several moneymaking 
possibilities, including hiking fees for overdue books and a new charge for 
placing personal book orders for publications not available in some local 
branches. Adams said the new fees were only proposals and no list of actual 
costs has yet been developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we may be the last library system in the country that doesn't charge 
a fee for ordering books," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law strictly regulates the types of fees county libraries may charge. 
And the law relating to public library operations is widely interpreted to 
prohibit systems from charging patrons for traditional library cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The libraries were established to be barrier-less access points to the world 
of information," Adams said. "To start charging for library cards would be 
contrary to that philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Adams said, the local system is considering a fund-raising 
program in which patrons would be presented with an additional "gold card" to 
recognize their financial contributions to county libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, fund raising had not been a crucial necessity," Adams said. "But 
this year's budget is going to require either a significant reduction of 
services or a significant infusion of new revenue." Dwindling Library Dollars 
</P>
<P>
 Severe budget cuts to the Orange County Public Library in recent years will 
likely force the closure of some of its 27 branches next year. Library 
officials expect next year's budget will be $9 million less than what was 
allocated two years ago. A look at the some of the library's funding shortfall:

GRAND JURY RECOMMENDS MERGERS OF WATER AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring that government inefficiency makes consumers pay too much for water, 
the Orange County Grand Jury called Wednesday for a drastic reorganization of 
some of the county's largest water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a much-anticipated report, the 19-member panel recommended that nine 
independent water districts be merged into two large agencies, eliminating 
"instances of overlapping and conflicting authority in water districts" while 
maintaining "a reliable source of water . . . into the next century." 
</P>
<P>
 One juror, John Baird, said the 42-page report that took six months to prepare 
reiterates recommendations that grand juries have been making for 23 years -- 
conclusions that the water industry has virtually ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1971, there have been recommendations that consolidations take place . 
. . and a very minimum number have occurred," said Baird, a retired Cal State 
Long Beach biology instructor from Anaheim. "We believe something still needs 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's non-binding recommendations will be presented to the county's Local 
Agency Formation Commission, which oversees and takes action on district 
consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent scandal at the powerful Santa Margarita Water District in South 
County that led to the indictments in March of two top managers played only a 
"very, very small part" in the grand jury review, Baird said. The report 
sidestepped any criticism of the Santa Margarita district. 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls for mergers on two levels of the system that delivers 
imported water from the Colorado River and Northern California throughout the 
county: the wholesale districts that sell water to other agencies and the 
retail districts that then sell the water to households and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the retail level, the jury recommended merging five of the biggest water 
districts in South County -- the Moulton Niguel, Irvine Ranch, El Toro, Los 
Alisos and Santa Margarita districts -- into one large agency managed by the 
Irvine Ranch district. The potential savings are not specified in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 At the wholesale level, based on an audit by the Ernst & Young accounting 
firm, the jury suggested merging the Tri-Cities and Coastal municipal water 
districts and the East Orange County Water District into one district managed 
by the huge Municipal Water District of Orange County. The merger would 
generate an annual savings of $758,158, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Each district's outstanding debt would have to be broken down and assessed to 
the affected taxpayers, the report suggested. The jury's report, while saying 
that consumers pay too much for water, does not specify how much. Nor does it 
indicate how much water rates might decrease under district reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Baird said the jury concluded that "fewer board members and fewer top 
management" personnel at the districts "would reduce some of these water 
charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrative costs for retail districts alone were $2.9 million in 1993, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials were clearly unhappy with the retail level 
recommendations, but generally supported merging the wholesale districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty radical, pretty drastic," Dale Heuerman, general manager of 
the East Orange County Water District, said of the recommendations for 
consolidating retail agencies. "It's not impossible, but it's full of a lot of 
problems. . . . It's quite a step all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch water board, said he was flattered 
his district was proposed to absorb other retail agencies, but he doubted a 
larger district would be better for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not convinced consolidation is a necessity," Swan said. "I think special 
districts serve a local constituency and generally serve it very well. It's 
local government." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ray Benedicktus, a director of the San Clemente-based Tri-Cities Municipal 
Water District, called the recommendations for the wholesale agencies "pretty 
cut-and-dried" and expected by his peers in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows there is a lot of room to consolidate at the wholesale 
level," said Benedicktus of Capistrano Beach. "This was no surprise. . . . But 
the retail recommendations came out of left field." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also recommended that Tri-Cities' small retail operations be taken 
over by the city of San Clemente and its proposed underground-water sharing 
arrangement with Camp Pendleton be taken over to the Municipal Water District 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Sprague, general manager of the Municipal Water District of Orange 
County, said his district has been studying consolidation for several years. 
The district already serves as a wholesale supplier to 27 water agencies 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague said "there is a fair amount of support for the grand jury 
recommendations as it relates to the wholesale water agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there would probably be some cost savings, but the more urgent issue 
is whether the region receives a stronger benefit as far as a more dependable 
water supply," he said. "I think there are some arguments that would say, yes, 
you clearly gain those." 
</P>
<P>
 At the retail level, Sprague said the issues are "far more complex. You have 
five different agencies that are already pretty big and relatively new. . . . 
It's certainly something to look at, but I think (the jury) may have gone a 
little too far on that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeably absent from the jury's report was direct mention of the beleaguered 
Santa Margarita district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's former general manager, Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, and his 
assistant, Michael P. Lord, are awaiting trial June 6 on criminal 
conflict-of-interest charges. Both have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, jurors focused on consolidation, which "looked to us would provide a 
much more reliable supply of water," Baird said. "We have just gone through a 
drought and we think this is critical."

'NOT GOD'S WILL,' MINISTER SAYS OF LEANORA WONG DEATH; MEMORIAL: SLAIN WOMAN IS 
EULOGIZED AS GENEROUS, FRIENDLY IN SERVICES ATTENDED BY MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 200 people filled a chapel and spilled out to the sidewalk Wednesday 
at a memorial service for Leanora Annette Wong, as a minister told them the 
slaying "was not an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hourlong service, the Rev. Warren Jarrard told the subdued crowd of 
family and friends that he shared with them "the common emptiness of loss." The 
question most in his mind in the days since her killing was, "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrard said he had no good answer, but told them that "Lea's death was not an 
act of God, not God's will." 
</P>
<P>
 Family member David Fong offered a biographical sketch of the 23-year-old UC 
Riverside graduate, who he said was at once shy and friendly, frugal and 
generous, and an integral part of a large, extended family that stretched from 
Washington to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime friend Hans Kaufhold of Newport Beach announced the establishment of 
a scholarship fund in Wong's name, probably for Ramona High School graduates 
who want to attend UC Riverside, as Wong did. Like other friends and family 
members, Kaufhold wore a pink ribbon pinned to the shoulder of his jacket in 
memory of the young woman he called "my closest friend since junior high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those attending the memorial declined to comment on the circumstances 
surrounding the prosecution and parole of the suspect in Wong's slaying, Edward 
Patrick Morgan Jr., on earlier rape charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But George Su, 23, of Riverside, said, "I think that maybe they could have 
done better on the last offense, when charges were dropped for insufficient 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, authorities said a 24-year-old Huntington Beach woman first said 
she was assaulted by several other men and later accused Morgan of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Su, who played on the Ramona High School tennis team with Wong and later 
attended UC Riverside, said that case "should be a lesson for all the women who 
have been abused to come forward to prevent this from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Su said he hoped Morgan now would "be put behind bars forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Fuentes, 23, of Riverside, who attended high school with Wong, said, 
"I don't think (Morgan) ever should have been let out. Jail doesn't do anything 
to them. They don't correct themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "To kill an innocent person . . . how can someone just beat a person to 
death?" Fuentes said tearfully. "I just can't imagine that. . . . I remember 
her smile, her laughter. That's something her family is not going to have any 
more."

SEX ATTACK REVEALED IN MORGAN CASE; COURTS: SLAYING SUSPECT FACES FELONY 
CHARGES THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH PENALTY IF HE IS CONVICTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In filing charges that would make convicted rapist Edward Patrick Morgan Jr. 
eligible for the death penalty, prosecutors disclosed for the first time 
Wednesday that the 23-year-old Huntington Beach woman he allegedly murdered had 
also been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 28, made his first court appearance here since his Monday capture in 
the small Northern California town of Quincy, where he had fled over the 
weekend in an attempt to elude an intensive manhunt that was launched after the 
slaying victim's body was discovered Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan displayed no emotion as he stood before Municipal Judge Barbara (Tam) 
Nomoto to hear felony charges made against him of murder and penetration of 
genitals with a foreign object. Prosecutors also made a special-circumstance 
allegation of murder during the course of sexual assault. Morgan was ordered 
held without bail until his June 10 arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum said Leanora Annette Wong was sexually 
assaulted with a "foreign object" and her body was so bloodied that authorities 
have had difficulty conducting normal rape tests. One law enforcement source, 
who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said authorities are still 
trying to locate the object used to mutilate Wong's genitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it might be impossible to determine whether semen is present, 
but it's also a moot point," said Rosenblum, who noted that Morgan already 
faces the harshest punishment possible, because sexual assault with a foreign 
object in conjunction with murder is punishable by the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Wong and Morgan met the night of May 19 at an Orange nightclub, 
where she had gone with a girlfriend. Authorities who were called after her 
body was discovered at the rear of a parking lot across the street from the 
club said she suffered severe upper body and pelvic injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was linked to the crime by fingerprints, witnesses who saw him with the 
victim and other evidence, including videotape from a security camera mounted 
on a nearby building, police said. Police have not yet discussed what evidence 
the camera may have captured. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has struck a nerve with many who believe the legal system failed 
again and again when it came to Morgan, who has been accused of raping young 
Orange County women four times in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was flown back from Northern California on Tuesday, a crowd of about 
100 angry onlookers booed and jeered as he was escorted from the chartered 
airplane that delivered him county authorities at the Fullerton Municipal 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in court Wednesday sneered at Morgan and said the death penalty 
would be "too good" for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Wong of Riverside, the victim's father, said Wednesday, "I want him to get 
the death penalty, and I want him to get it fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said his pain has worsened in recent days as he has learned of Morgan's 
lengthy criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shouldn't have been on the streets in the first place, and I want him off 
the streets so he'll never hurt another girl again," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen J. Biskar said he is concerned that the media 
and public interest will jeopardize his client's ability to receive a fair 
trial. Biskar said that he had not yet spoken to Morgan about the crime but 
that Morgan has made a statement to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "This media storm reminds me of the Romans cheering as the lions are eating 
the Christians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biskar said he is still sifting through evidence in the case and would pay 
particular attention to any evidence showing whether the alleged sexual assault 
took place before or after Wong died -- a distinction that could mean the 
difference between life in prison and the death penalty if Morgan is convicted 
of Wong's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Biskar said the autopsy shows an object was forced into Wong's rectum, and 
ripped the wall between the rectum and vagina, causing major tissue tearing and 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in court Wednesday was Donna Renee Tatum, 28, of Ontario, who is accused 
of harboring Morgan by driving him to Northern California, Rosenblum said. One 
of Tatum's friends who was present in court said Tatum feared Morgan would kill 
her if she did not help him leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just a sweet person who got all caught up in this," said Linda Hemicker 
of Apple Valley, who said she is Tatum's best friend. Tatum was sitting with 
Morgan when they saw a news report that police were searching for him. "He told 
her, 'It's all lies,' and made her drive him," Hemicker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemicker said she was shocked to learn of Morgan's background because he 
seemed like such a nice guy and attracted many women. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what is so scary about this," she said. "Most women would think he's a 
nice, sexy guy, someone they would like to know." 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, it was this likable demeanor that persuaded 
several of his female victims to trust Morgan even though he was a stranger. In 
two cases, the victims willingly accepted rides from him. In another case, a 
victim agreed to take a walk with him after meeting him at a party. They 
reported that his demeanor changed and he turned violent once they were alone, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 In two of the three rape complaints that were formally filed against Morgan, 
the criminal justice system let him off on less serious charges of statutory 
rape. In a fourth case, he was not prosecuted at all. Instead, the Orange 
County district attorney's office declined to prosecute and allowed Morgan to 
be returned to prison for the remaining 12 months of his prison sentence for 
his third rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 If Morgan had been prosecuted and convicted in that last alleged rape, he 
could have been sentenced to up to 12 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors said they did the best they could, but added that 
many of the previous cases were weak and raised questions about the credibility 
of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in law enforcement feels a sense of grief over this case," Rosenblum 
said Wednesday. "In a perfect world, everyone will be caught and successfully 
prosecuted. . . . It's my opinion that the best was done on everyone's part." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan also narrowly avoided yet another possible parole revocation within 
days of Wong's murder. He tested positive for cocaine on May 10 and the results 
were completed by May 17, but Morgan's parole officer did not have evidence 
that he had violated the terms of his parole by using drugs until authorities 
were already searching for him in connection with the slaying, said Tip Kindel, 
spokesman for the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindel said Morgan had passed several drug tests since his release from prison 
in late March, but it is likely his parole would have been revoked after the 
recent urine test. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that kind of a background as a sex offender and a drug user, it is 
likely he would have been taken back into custody immediately," said Kindel, 
who said his office is investigating the delay in reporting the drug test 
results and implementing a new notification system to prevent another lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked after the court hearing whether it was possible for Morgan to make it 
back onto the streets again, Rosenblum shook his head. "I will do the best I 
can to make sure that doesn't happen," he said.

JURY CALLS FOR DEATH PENALTY IN CARJACK CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ and RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County jury on Wednesday recommended the death penalty for a 
20-year-old Tustin man who carjacked an Anaheim college student, robbed him of 
$1 and then executed the student as he lay crouched in the trunk of his Jetta. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors sobbed as the verdict was announced against Shawn Kareem Burney, 
who last week was convicted along with two friends in connection with the 
murder of 23-year-old Joseph Andrew Kondrath in one of Orange County's first 
carjacking cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors sought the death penalty only for Burney because they believe he 
was the triggerman in the 1992 attack. Jurors had little difficult agreeing 
that Burney had only himself to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he pulled that trigger, he took his own life," said one juror, who spoke 
on the condition that her name be withheld. "We didn't have a choice because of 
the coldbloodedness of the crime . . . and because there was no evidence of any 
remorse on Burney's part." 
</P>
<P>
 Burney appeared shaken in court Wednesday, taking off his glasses to wipe his 
eyes. His family and the family of his victim wept as the jury's recommendation 
was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Kosman, Kondrath's cousin, said his family is taking their grief one 
day at a time, trying to get past their anger and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are satisfied with this verdict," Kosman said outside the courtroom. "We 
just want to put this behind us and go on and live a normal life. We'll never 
forget Joey."  
</P>
<P>
 He said his sympathy goes out to the families of Burney and his two 
co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel anguish like they feel anguish," Kosman said. "We just want to put 
this behind us, get on with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald is scheduled to 
sentence Burney Sept. 2. If the judge follows the jury's recommendation, Burney 
would become the 29th person sent to Death Row from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kondrath was last seen leaving for his job at a supermarket at 4 a.m. on June 
10, 1992. Prosecutors said he was grabbed from behind the wheel of his car in 
front of his home, robbed and shot in the head. Authorities believe Kondrath 
was murdered to eliminate him as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Kondrath's body was found stuffed in the trunk of his car, not far from the 
condominium he shared with his mother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder was among the county's first fatal carjackings, and it occurred 
when that type of crime began making headlines and rattling the nerves of 
motorists nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury convicted Burney and Allen Dean Burnett, 20, of Anaheim of 
first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery and additional charges. Scott Rembert, 
22, of Anaheim was convicted of kidnaping, but jurors deadlocked on remaining 
counts including murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett will be sentenced in July. Prosecutors also must decide whether to 
retry Rembert. 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury deliberated for less than a day before deciding to recommend the 
death penalty for Burney. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent called the jury's recommendation appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to ask a jury to pass the ultimate penalty," Brent said. "But 
the facts of this case cried out for it. It's hard to imagine a more brutal, 
coldblooded crime -- a crime that valued human life any less than this." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror said that "what pushed us over the line" toward the death penalty 
was trial testimony that Burney went dancing shortly after he killed Kondrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, some jurors sobbed as they exchanged hugs with 
Kondrath's relatives. Some said it was the most painful decision they had made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing compared to the burden we faced in the jury room," another woman 
juror said. "No one should ever have to do this twice in a lifetime."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIREFIGHTER GRIEVANCE ARBITRATION ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a small victory for the Westminster firefighters union, a federal judge has 
ordered the city to submit to arbitration of a grievance filed by Paul 
Gilbrook, the union president who was fired in February. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's ruling by U.S. District Judge Ronald S. Lew means that the cases 
of five other recently dismissed Fire Department employees will also be 
resolved by arbitration, not a City Council-appointed panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling will also affect Battalion Chief Glen Hines, who is facing 
suspension over the same alleged payroll violations that other firefighters 
have been accused of committing. 
</P>
<P>
 An arbitrator's decision, however, would be non-binding, and the council would 
retain the authority to decide whether Gilbrook and the other dismissed Fire 
Department employees will win their jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alan C. Davis, attorney for the firefighters and the Westminster 
Firefighters Local 2425, said that an arbitrator's finding of wrongful 
termination against the firefighters would bolster their case in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most important decision we have had in the past year," Davis 
said. "This forces the council to recognize that they will not control the 
hearing process." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard Jones said Lew's decision "resolved a procedural question" 
and will allow "both sides to get this thing over with in some fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had insisted that the firefighters file their appeal to the 
Merit System Commission, a three-member panel that reviews disciplinary actions 
against employees. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; PARENTS OBJECT TO ASSIGNED CLASS BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of several fifth-grade students at Bryant Ranch Elementary School say 
their children have been assigned to read a book filled with profanity and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents are protesting the use of "My Brother Sam Is Dead," an award- 
winning book by James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier about a young 
boy's experiences during the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The 216-page book, which was awarded the prestigious Newberry Honor Book 
designation in 1975, was assigned earlier this month by four teachers at the 
school as part of a social studies lesson on the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Tuesday of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District 
Board of Trustees, Tamara Heathcote, whose daughter was assigned the book, read 
a list of words contained in the book, including "bastard," "goddamn," and "son 
of a bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the list, as well as several excerpts, Trustee Jerry Brakebill 
asked, "How in the world did that book get in the classroom to begin with?" 
</P>
<P>
 The book, which is not on the district list of approved books but is on a 
state Department of Education list, currently is being reviewed by a committee 
of school administrators, teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee could make several recommendations, including that the book 
continue to be available to fifth-grade teachers, or that it be restricted to 
older students.  
</P>
<P>
 Until the committee makes a recommendation, the book will continue to be used. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Heathcote and two other parents also criticized the book's depiction of 
violence, saying that it would be rated "R" if it were a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In one passage, the young protagonist witnesses a British officer decapitating 
a slave. He also details the execution of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine as a parent handing this book to kids as suggested reading," 
Heathcote said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three fifth-grade students from the school, including Linda Heathcote, 11, 
told the board they didn't think they or their classmates should be reading the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids said if their parents saw the book they wouldn't be able to read 
it, so they weren't going to tell" their parents)'Linda Heathcote said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have assigned an alternate book to students whose parents object to 
"My Brother Sam Is Dead," but some parents and students say that is not an 
acceptable arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we are out of the room sometimes we don't hear our teacher tell us about 
things like spelling words and vocabulary words we have to know," Chad 
Challoner said. DANIELLE FOQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; TRUSTEE DROPS SUIT AGAINST PARENT GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trustee of the Anaheim Union High School District dropped her lawsuit 
Wednesday against a parents group she said had harassed her for refusing to 
remove two novels from English literature classes in local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 R.A. (Molly) McGee, who also teaches at Crystal Cathedral Academy in Garden 
Grove, had contended that members of a group called Citizens for Better Schools 
made threatening phone calls to her at home and at work. Additionally, she 
alleged that the group tried to besmirch her reputation and question her 
morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, a Superior Court judge refused to grant McGee a temporary 
restraining order against the group because he said there was insufficient 
evidence that the parents were behind the harassing phone calls. A hearing had 
been scheduled for today on further arguments in the case, but that has been 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The harassment has continued, but the proof problem is still the same," said 
Patrick Dolan, McGee's attorney. "I have no idea who else would be doing this. 
Unfortunately, we can't prove it right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Treva Brown, president of the parents group, said she was pleased that the 
suit was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I deserve an apology and a retraction of everything that she said," 
Brown said. "She made some very serious charges, and none of it was true. I did 
not harass her. I did nothing. Who's being harassed here? I was being hauled 
into court on false charges. That's harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee contended in her suit that she was singled out by the group because she 
refused to remove the books "Ordinary People" and "The Great Santini" from the 
reading list in literature classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which continues to protest the use of those books, maintains that 
the books contain pornographic references and should not be required reading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Union High School District Board of Trustees disagreed, voting 4 
to 1 in September not to remove the books from classrooms. MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; OLD COMPUTERS TEACH STUDENTS NEW TRICKS

<P>
 Thirty rebuilt computers were donated to four schools Wednesday under a new 
program designed to help schoolchildren learn to use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers help students develop their writing skills more quickly, said Linda 
Morton, a seventh-grade teacher at Lexington Junior High School, who picked up 
seven computers for her Cypress school from the Coast Community College 
District office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't like the erasing part when they are writing," Morton said of her 
students. "So the deleting key is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Her student 13-year-old Cinthia Bryhl quickly agreed. "Instead of having a 
boring old report to do, I like making it more fun," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Computers for Schools program refurbishes and distributes computers 
discarded by companies, in this case Pacific Bell.  
</P>
<P>
 John Britton, a spokesman for Pacific Bell, said his company expects to donate 
more than 800 used computers during the next year.  
</P>
<P>
 Computers were also donated to the Damron Elementary School in Cypress, 
Portola Middle School in Orange and Cypress High School. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN SHOOTS HIMSELF ACCIDENTALLY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old man who was trying to prevent a shooting mishap died late 
Tuesday after shooting himself in the head accidentally, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Gonzalez, who lived in the 1900 block of West Martha Lane, had taken the 
gun away from a relative to avoid an accident and had checked it to make sure 
it was not loaded, Santa Ana police spokesman Sgt. Dick Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust said Gonzalez mistakenly believed the gun was not loaded when he pulled 
back on its slide and no rounds were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez then playfully put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, Faust 
said. The gun fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics from the Santa Ana Fire Department took Gonzalez to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where he was pronounced dead at 11:13 p.m., Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was an employee of Baxter Healthcare Corp., according to family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 A rosary will be recited at 7 tonight at Brown's Mortuary in Santa Ana. 
Funeral services are planned for 10 a.m. Friday at Immaculate Heart of Mary 
Church in Santa Ana. ACCIDENTAL DEATH

 Visa, Sprint Team Up for Discount: Visa International stepped up its battle 
with MasterCard International on Wednesday by offering a new service with 
Sprint that lets users charge long-distance calls at a deep discount.The 
Visa-Sprint alliance puts one more contender into an industry already crowded 
with programs offering discounts for calls charged to their cards. The Visa 
card's new feature, VisaPhone, ups the ante by offering a discount 25% cheaper 
than the calling card rate offered by AT&T, the biggest long-distance carrier. 
AT&T has been in a competitive brawl with Sprint and MCI. With VisaPhone, even 
users of AT&T's own Visa card, the Universal Card, could receive the Sprint 
discount.

LOCAL HOTEL INDUSTRY'S WELCOME MAT WELL-RECEIVED IN '93; TRAVEL: ANAHEIM, SANTA 
ANA BOOST OCCUPANCY RATE. CORPORATE RELOCATIONS FROM L.A. IS ONE REASON FOR 
GAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's hotel industry showed strong gains in 1993 and fared far 
better than that in Los Angeles County, according to a survey released this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels in the Anaheim and Santa Ana area boosted the county's overall 
occupancy rate for the year by four percentage points to 69.3%, according to a 
report published by accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Smith Travel Research, a 
Tennessee-based consultant to the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the occupancy rate for Los Angeles metropolitan area hotels fell 
by more than a point to 62.6%, while the rate for San Diego decreased slightly 
to 66.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the gain in Orange County is corporate relocations from 
downtown Los Angeles, said Cheryl L. Phelps, regional manager for eight Hyatt 
hotels in the two counties. "Businesses are finding Orange County more 
desirable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For this year, the outlook is more positive than in 1993 for Los Angeles, 
Phelps said. Downtown hotels were filled with federal emergency management 
agents, Red Cross workers and insurance investigators following the Jan. 17 
earthquake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sherwin, spokesman for the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau, said 
that the newly expanded Los Angeles Convention Center, which was completed in 
November, will also boost Los Angeles figures for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown hasn't had group business. It has had to rely on individual business 
travel," Sherwin said, contrasting it with Orange County's popular Anaheim 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, tourism stimulated by the World Cup competition in Los 
Angeles should also benefit hotels across the region, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Host Report, as the study is called, surveyed 2,700 full-service hotels 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The full-service hotels handle primarily meetings business, and that has been 
strong here," said Reint Reinders, president of the San Diego Convention & 
Visitors Bureau. "The element we have struggled with is the discretionary 
individual traveler who drives here for a couple of days." How O.C. Hotels 
Fared in 1993

 Though room rates dropped, profit per room increased 45% last year over 1992.

WASHINGTON POST GOT IT YEARS BEFORE THE REGISTER DID; MARKETING: THE $1-MILLION 
LOCAL CAMPAIGN PARROTS THE EAST COAST PAPER'S WORD FOR WORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Register's new $1-million advertising campaign -- "If you 
don't get it, you don't get it" -- has drawn a strong protest from the 
Washington Post, whose long-running ad campaign uses exactly the same wording. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Werner, assistant counsel for the Washington Post, said Wednesday 
that her newspaper has asked the Register to stop using the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post applied for a trademark for its campaign slogan last fall, 
Werner said, and has been using it for almost two years. It appears on transit 
posters and in print, television and radio ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really successful campaign we've developed, and we have an interest in 
protecting that," Werner said, predicting an amicable resolution of the matter 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 John Schueler, the Register's executive vice president and general manager, 
said the publishers of the two newspapers are discussing the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Register's campaign, its first with a full-service ad agency, was created 
by Stein Robaire Helm of Los Angeles. The ads feature puzzled-looking people 
saying, "I don't get it." Below that, with a photo of the Register, is the 
phrase, "If you don't get it, you don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ads are being displayed on Orange County Transportation Authority buses 
and bus shelters, at shopping malls and in publications across Orange County. 
An industry insider estimates the cost of the campaign at just over $1 million, 
not including TV spots slated to run later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schueler said he questions how the Register could be infringing on a 
Washington Post trademark when at least one other newspaper, the Oregonian, has 
also borrowed from the Post campaign, though not word for word. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregonian's tag line is, "When you get it, you'll get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schueler said the Register's "don't get it" campaign is only a small part of a 
long-term marketing strategy and was never intended to run for very long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the teaser part of the campaign," he said. "It's not the central issue." 
</P>
<P>
 An internal Register circular to its staff describes the phrase as the "theme 
or . . . 'concept' of the new campaign." The circular said the campaign will 
run for 33 weeks.

4.5 TEMBLOR A FAMILIAR WAKE-UP CALL; SEISMOLOGY: EARLY- MORNING AFTERSHOCK NEAR

 Residents of Los Angeles and Ventura counties received a jarring but 
short-lived wake-up call Wednesday morning when the largest aftershock to the 
Northridge earthquake in two months rattled the Los Angeles Basin, but caused 
only minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 4.5-magnitude shaker was only powerful enough to break a few dishes 
and rattle some nerves, for many it provided a grim reminder of the destructive 
pre-dawn quake of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like 'Here we go again,' " said Shawn Rucker, 24, of San Fernando. At 
his house, picture frames and plants fell to the floor and several glasses 
broke in his kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a train going through my house," he said. "I expected it to go on 
like the Jan. 17 earthquake, then it just stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5:56 a.m. temblor, which shook for as long as 15 seconds in parts of the 
San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, was centered three miles northeast of San 
Fernando. It was felt throughout the basin and as far west as Camarillo in 
Ventura County. Caltech seismologists said it was even felt on Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, smaller aftershocks struck the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the more emotional people were just starting to relax," said Kate 
Hutton at Caltech. "This was a pretty good feeler. It's the nature of nature, 
and we can't do much about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As jarring as the aftershock was, scientists say it was not only normal, it 
was overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucile M. Jones said a computer analysis 
predicted we would likely get four aftershocks over magnitude 4 between March 
20 -- the date of the last significant aftershock -- and Wednesday's temblor. 
Instead, there was only this one, and it was a relatively small one at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a little less than would have been expected," said Jones. "It is not 
very typical at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents a few miles from the epicenter were particularly shaken. At the 
Tahitian Mobile Home Park in Sylmar, where 64 trailers burned after the 
Northridge quake, the jolt brought renewed fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking that if it went on any longer, I would throw my body over my 
sons, and then it stopped," said Susan Rezvani, 37, standing with her two boys, 
Neema, 12, and Naveed, 4, outside a friend's trailer. "I thought about not 
letting them go to school today, but I ended up sending them." 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Hofmann, 60, has lived in a motor home outside his Sylmar house since it 
was red-tagged after the Northridge quake. During Wednesday's temblor, he said 
the rubber wheels on the trailer made it bounce up and down like a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the epicenter was here," said Hofmann. "Everybody started yelling 
and screaming, 'My God, not again!' " Luckily, the only casualty in his 
makeshift home was a fax machine that fell from a shelf, Hofmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the damage was also minor. Cracks in the walls of homes not 
yet repaired from the January quake widened, chandeliers swung, dishes broke 
and frightened children hopped in bed with parents who couldn't get back to 
sleep anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported electrical, water or phone service disruptions and no 
freeway closures due to the aftershock, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 8,000 aftershocks since the Jan. 17 quake, only about 400 could be felt 
by residents. Seven of the aftershocks were between magnitudes 5 and 6; 
approximately 40 were between 4 and 5. More than 300 were between 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 20 aftershock, which measured magnitude 5.3 and was centered near 
Panorama City, sparked two fires in the Valley but caused no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Kenneth Reich contributed to this story. Shock After Shock 
Although the number of daily aftershocks from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
has dropped substantially, the earth continues to move. According to 
seismologists at Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, 
Wednesday's early morning 4.5 shaker was the strongest since a magnitude 5.3 
temblor on March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in spurts," said USGS seismologist Thomas Heaton after last week's 
3.6 temblor. "Any random phenomena comes in clusters." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent aftershocks include: 
</P>
<P>

San Fernando

CHARITY SOLICITOR MAY LOSE LICENSE; INQUIRY: L.A. SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS 
AWAITING FUND-RAISER'S RECORDS. QUESTIONS ARISE ABOUT CHECKS AND 
REPRESENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles officials took a major step Wednesday toward banning a charitable 
fund-raising organization that was the subject of a Times article disclosing 
that it cashed checks for charities that don't exist and real charities that it 
did not represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Burns, general manager of the Los Angeles Social Service Department, 
said he issued a notice of intention to revoke the license of Thomas Galambos, 
president and owner of Valley Fundraisers, after Galambos failed to comply with 
his order to produce the firm's records by 5 p.m. last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said his office received one call from Galambos' attorney, Elliott 
Kajan, who left a message but did not respond to Burns' return call. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called. We called back. We never actually talked," Burns said Wednesday. 
"Mr. Galambos didn't call. There seems to be a greater need for affirmative 
action on Mr. Galambos' part than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Kajan said he had only 
recently been retained by Galambos and would not comment until he had completed 
his own review of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice said Galambos' license, which allows him to run a commercial 
enterprise raising funds for charities, will be revoked June 6 if he does not 
request a hearing before the Social Service Commission. Burns said the 
revocation will be automatic unless Galambos can persuade the commission to 
overturn his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of his license would prohibit Galambos from soliciting funds on behalf of 
any charities in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns had already withdrawn the city permit, called an Information Card, that 
authorized Galambos' current campaign through August on behalf of three 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Galambos could not apply for a new license without submitting the 
firm's books and records for an audit. Besides revocation of Galambos' 
fund-raising license, Burns said he could also recommend that the Los Angeles 
city attorney's office file criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a misdemeanor in the city of Los Angeles to commit fraud or deception in 
charitable solicitation or to solicit on behalf of another person or 
organization without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times disclosed earlier this month that Valley Fundraisers, which has 
taken in more than $2.6 million in charitable donations in the past four years, 
has deposited dozens of checks made out to charities it does not represent, 
some real and others nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 121 commercial fund-raising firms in California, Valley Fundraisers is 
licensed by the Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts to solicit 
donations for three IRS-registered charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times found that checks made out to more than 30 different names had been 
deposited into Valley Fundraisers' bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos, in an interview, acknowledged that mistakes had been made but said 
he corrected every one that came to his attention by refunding the donor's 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 In its investigation, The Times found checks from nine organizations -- 
including Easter Seals, March of Dimes and Marine Corps' Toy for Tots -- 
received by Valley Fundraisers without authorization. Officials of those 
organizations said they had not received the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers' headquarters, on Alameda Avenue, in Burbank, closed 
shortly after the Times article appeared, and its phone was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galambos operation also remains under a parallel investigation by the 
state attorney general's office.

WORLD CUP MAY KICK IN NEEDED CASH; GLENDALE: TOURNAMENT ORGANIZERS ESTIMATE 
SOCCER FANS WILL PUMP UP TO $622 MILLION INTO REGION'S ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The World Cup may be about soccer, but for hundreds of businesses in Burbank 
and Glendale the quadrennial international tournament may be a ticket out of 
the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants, restaurateurs and hotel operators in both cities are preparing for 
a swell in business as about 800,000 tourists descend on the Southland to watch 
eight matches, including the finals, played at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Between June 17 and July 17, as much as $622 million in tourism dollars will 
be pumped into the region's economy, according to World Cup organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a longtime recession. We see this as a stimulus," said Glendale 
Mayor Eileen Givens, where police are training with those of Pasadena and 
Burbank to provide crowd control and security at the matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glendale is anonymous to a lot of people who don't live here. This is a 
chance to make a name for ourselves. We're looking to seize the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Galleria and businesses along Central Avenue and Brand Boulevard 
will be ready to welcome the hordes of international visitors with open arms 
and cash registers. At the Galleria, a number of stores are prominently 
displaying World Cup merchandise, from T-shirts and caps to jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Burbank, city officials are unsure of what to expect from the world's 
largest sporting event and have largely avoided promoting the city to arriving 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike any sporting event to ever come to town, the World Cup takes place at 
nine venues nationwide and is 31 days long. That's 31 days of tourists 
shopping, dining and finding other ways to spend money. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the games will be played at the Rose Bowl, businesses in Glendale and 
Burbank are hoping sightseers don't stray too far when looking for things to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's making us happy is we've heard they're very good shoppers," said Donna 
Lum, marketing director for the Media City Center mall in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the (1984) Olympics, people heard so much negative that everyone left 
town. The difference here is we're anticipating, happily, more people coming 
in. We're in a different economic situation. We need the shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, where soccer is as popular as baseball, city officials have spent 
$15,000 to organize local activities related to the World Cup and hire a 
public-relations firm. The activities include a soccer relay along an 18-mile 
course on June 11 and street parties June 24 and July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the World Cup logo will appear on public buses and banners along Brand 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Burbank city officials -- with the exception of Police Chief Dave 
Newsham -- say they have made little effort to prepare for the event, partly 
because they are uncertain of what to expect from a tournament that has never 
taken place in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Airport "is going to get a lot of business," Burbank Mayor Bill 
Wiggins said. "But whether Burbank will, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean to be blase. I'm not in any way playing the event down. I just 
don't see Burbank playing a large part in the World Cup matches." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Chamber of Commerce originally intended to let its retail 
committee work on promotions related to the World Cup. But that plan fell 
through when the committee chairman left Burbank to take another job, said Zoe 
Taylor, the chamber's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not something we've done a lot of work on," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of terrorism and soccer's reputation for attracting devout and 
sometimes violent followers has law enforcement agencies planning ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers at the Burbank and Glendale police departments will be on call to 
back up the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Pasadena police if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand, this is a neat way to bring people together," Newsham said. 
"On the other hand, there are some countries with centuries of rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Red Lion Hotel in Glendale and the Burbank Airport Hilton, reservations 
for the monthlong tournament have been slower than anticipated, with the 
exception of the final week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Lion, one of four hotels in the Los Angeles area where the 
international media will be lodged, had set aside 200 of its 348 rooms for 
World Cup attendees. 
</P>
<P>
 But only about half of those blocked rooms have been reserved, said Janet 
Waldie, the hotel's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams scheduled to play at the Rose Bowl do not have followings as strong 
as other teams, she said, and the final matchups have not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact in the Los Angeles area will be more, per se, over finals week," 
she said. "I think there will be an economic impact. It just may not be to the 
extent originally thought."

CPA REVIEW FIRM SETTLES BIAS CASE; LAWS: ENCINO COMPANY AGREES TO ALLOW 
HEARING-IMPAIRED STUDENTS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND INTERPRETERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly 18 months of fighting and mounting legal bills, Newton Becker, 
whose company runs the nation's largest review course for certified accountant 
candidates, has surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 His Ventura Boulevard-based firm, Becker CPA Review, gained unwanted notoriety 
in December, 1992, when it became the target of the first lawsuit filed by the 
U. S. Justice Department to enforce the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act. 
The suit accused the company of discriminating against hearing-impaired 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this month, he agreed to a Justice Department consent order that 
gives hearing-impaired students in his classes the right to demand sign 
language interpreters or other aids of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, his company must establish a $25,000 scholarship fund for 
hearing-impaired accounting students at Cal State Northridge, pay $20,000 for 
the group of seven Becker students named in the case, and follow an elaborate 
set of guidelines for dealing with hearing-impaired students through mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
 For other private schools and educational programs, the outcome is a signal 
that one-size-fits-all approaches to accommodating the disabled may no longer 
be acceptable. To federal attorneys and advocates for the disabled, the outcome 
is a reasonable response to the law's broad goals of equal access. 
</P>
<P>
 To an unhappy Becker, however, it means the prospect of having to spend up to 
$9,000 per deaf student (admittedly a tiny percentage of his clientele) on 
interpreters for a program that charges only about $1,300 in tuition. "I don't 
think this was the intent of Congress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath all the wrangling, the case came down to a relatively simple 
dispute: Becker originally wanted to continue his company's longstanding 
practice of giving deaf students transcripts of his own tape-recorded lectures 
that account for most of the 130-hour program. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal attorneys argued that hearing-impaired students were deprived of the 
equal learning experience required by law because, along with other problems, 
they could not hear the non-scripted comments of course instructors and 
question-and-answer sessions during the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the government prevailed with its approach that private 
educational programs must tailor their assistance to meet the specific needs of 
disabled students, although a federal judge along the way suggested that the 
government's demands of Becker went beyond the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't expect one type of aid to work for everybody," said Irene Bowen, 
deputy chief of the Justice Department's public access section, which handles 
enforcement of the law. "The problem here was Mr. Becker had determined the 
transcripts were enough for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Although lacking the same legal weight as a court ruling, the settlement will 
have a broad impact. The 37-year-old company, founded and headed by Becker, 
offers its courses at about 130 locations nationwide, and claims thousands of 
people passing the CPA test each year are its alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four years after then-President George Bush signed the ADA into law and 
2 1/2 years after it went into effect, the Becker lawsuit is one of six filed 
by the Justice Department, Bowen said. Three, including Becker's, have now been 
settled, and three others are pending, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law guarantees equal opportunities to people with disabilities, mental or 
physical, and including those with the human immunodeficiency virus, in 
employment, state and local government services, transportation and in dealing 
with a wide range of business locations that serve the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter category, "public accommodations," includes lodgings, 
food-and-drink outlets, movie theaters and other similar venues, stores, 
service locations such as doctor's and attorney's offices, recreational 
facilities and all private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, such locations are required to provide "auxiliary aids and 
services" if needed by disabled people to have equal access, unless doing so 
would "fundamentally alter" the activity or result in "an undue burden." Those 
aids and services can be structural changes or assistants such as interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, a 66-year-old Bel-Air resident, argued that in the past, deaf students 
in his courses had been successful using the transcripts. But the Justice 
Department filed the case after a WashingtonC.-area deaf man, Rod Jex, sought 
and was denied an interpreter in mid-1992. As a result of Jex's complaint, the 
Justice Department filed suit in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Becker's company must provide any extras for students 
with hearing impairments at no added charge for at least the three-year term of 
the settlement. It also requires extensive staff training, reports to federal 
officials and publicity about the new policies. 
</P>
<P>
 More than the potential cost of the interpreters, Becker said his gripe is one 
of principle, over what he calls an unclear law that invites legal disputes. 
"What's really needed is clarification of the law so it will make sense and 
people can abide by it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under ADA regulations, written texts are one permitted method for 
accommodating the hearing-impaired. That was one of Becker's main arguments. 
But federal attorneys said his four-hour class sessions and their complex 
subject matter demanded additional measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said the legal fight cost him more than $200,000 in legal fees, and 
would have cost that much again had he tried to take the case to trial. He did, 
however, get some support from U. S. District Judge Thomas Hogan in a hearing 
on the case in December in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the transcript, Hogan questioned the Justice Department's "rush 
to judgment" in filing the case while settlement talks were continuing. And the 
judge challenged the department's stance in the case that Becker must provide 
the particular aid demanded by hearing-impaired students. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not what the regulation says. That is not what the statute says," the 
judge said, according to the transcript. Although he did not rule for either 
side that day, Hogan did say he saw no basis for "substantial, if any, damages 
against Becker for any alleged violations."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; INQUISITIVE RESIDENT TO GET ANSWERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Patty Baugh looks around her neighborhood, all kinds of questions pop up. 
 
</P>
<P>
 What is going to happen to the dilapidated park on 23rd Street? Can the 
neighbors hold an unlimited number of garage sales? Who keeps picking through 
her trash? Is there a gang problem around here? 
</P>
<P>
 Baugh, who lives on Albert Place on the east side of Costa Mesa, recently 
began seeking answers from city officials. And in doing so, she discovered that 
a lot of people share her concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 So she decided to call a community meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried about things I saw happening near my house and I felt I had to 
do something," said Baugh, the mother of three young children, who is proving 
that you don't have to be the mayor to hold a meeting with community leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 Already the Police Department, the superintendent of the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District, Mesa Consolidated Water District officials and a local gang 
counselor have agreed to speak at the meeting. Also, local businesses have 
donated everything from doughnuts and chairs to juice containers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of June 15, Baugh will get her questions answered, and with any 
luck, so will the rest of her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Local water district spokeswoman Mary Urashima said that her office gets 
invited to community meetings all the time by organized groups but rarely from 
a resident who has taken the organizational task upon themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district is in the midst of building an 18-million-gallon reservoir 
near Baugh's house.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Supt. Mac Bernd also was enthusiastic about speaking at Baugh's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am interested in the same issues that Patty is interested in," Bernd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baugh acknowledges that lining up four influential community residents to 
speak is the easy part. The tough part is getting her neighbors to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people come," she said. "But if they don't, the five of us will have 
plenty of doughnuts to eat, and I'll get my questions answered." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood meeting will be held at 7 p.m. on June 15 at Kaiser 
Elementary School, 2130 Santa Ana Ave.

 Two unidentified people involved in the scam remain at large, but without the 
cash they sought from their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the con artists first called an 83-year-old woman on Friday, asking her 
to assist in an internal bank investigation, Detective Manuel Ramos said 
Wednesday. On Saturday they called an 86-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women agreed to withdraw money from their accounts and take it to a 
nearby fast-food restaurant, where they were told a bank representative would 
meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 But things didn't work out the way the con artists hoped, police said. The 
first woman withdrew the money but got lost trying to find the restaurant. And 
the second woman wasn't able to withdraw the money. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 86-year-old arrived at the restaurant Saturday afternoon without the 
money, she was told to try it again Monday. Instead, she called police when she 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos said police also were called after the 83-year-old woman, who couldn't 
find the restaurant, went back to her bank to redeposit the cash and told the 
teller what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Police describe one suspect, who was waiting in the restaurant, as a woman 
with a dark complexion, in her 40s or 50s and weighing about 150 pounds. The 
suspect on the phone identified himself to the first woman as Mr. O'Conner and 
as Mr. Thompson to the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos cautioned that bank examiners, auditors and investigators do not ask 
bank customers to become involved in internal investigations. JAIME ABDO

 Helen Rieder, director of Burbank Temple Emanu El Nursery School, will be 
honored June 5 at the temple's annual dinner dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in the former Czechoslovakia, the Auschwitz survivor has served the 
congregation and the Burbank community for 30 years. From her beginnings as the 
oldest of nine children, to the loss of all but one relative in the Holocaust, 
to her stint in the Israeli army, Rieder has shown a remarkable spirit that 
inspires those around her, her friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's so wonderful with the children. She's always got the right thing to 
say. She's a wonderful mentor for the teachers as well, said JoAnn Young, 
educational chairwoman for the temple. "She's very serious about her Judaism. 
She takes it to heart. She's a very devoted person, but the bitterness is not 
there at all. To be able to show the community at large a little taste of 
Judaism and what Jewish people are all about, that seems to help her because 
there was so much hatred when she was growing up."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN LIBRARY EASES FINES ON LATE BOOKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge is offering amnesty to the most common of common 
criminals: those who keep their library books past the due date. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to return about 5,000 volumes to their shelves in the aftermath 
of the Northridge earthquake, Dean of Library Services Susan Curzon has 
declared June a penalty-free month for overdue books, even those that were 
forgotten under beds and on cluttered shelves accruing fines well before the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been such a difficult time for our patrons," Curzon said. "We wanted 
to do something special for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 15 cartons of books were water damaged after the temblor, most of the 
university's 1.1 million volumes were not seriously harmed when the Oviatt 
Library was battered by the quake. Since the students were on vacation at the 
time, only a fraction of the 500,000 books that circulate every year were 
checked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine-free period will run from June 1-30. After that, no fines will be 
assessed for books during the period from Jan. 17 to May 16. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; WEDGWOOD'S CHINA SURVIVES PIANO STUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lord Piers Anthony Weymouth Wedgwood was brought to his hands and knees 
Wednesday as a baby grand piano was lowered onto three pieces of Wedgwood 
china. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Wedgwood, a 12th-generation descendant of Gilbert Wedgwood who started 
the family's china business in the 17th Century, was at the second floor of the 
I. Magnin store in Woodland Hills to demonstrate the durability and strength of 
the world-famous china -- best known for its "Jasper" line, featuring 
neo-classical design motifs, introduced in 1774. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a small crowd of shoppers, Wedgwood slipped a delicate demitasse cup 
used for an espresso cup under the legs of the piano.  
</P>
<P>
 The good news: The cups survived, withstanding the weight of the baby grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Wedgwood is no stranger to outrageous publicity stunts. He was recently 
on hand in London to witness a double-decker bus with 35 passengers on board 
hoisted on top of some Wedgwood tea cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedgwood is now touring with his demitasse cups, and ever the statesman, said 
he enjoys traveling around the world and "seeing all the beautiful places like 
Woodland Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 The stunts, he said, "happen to demonstrate the quality of the product." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he warned, "we don't suggest people throw around their china." Or 
leave it at the mercy of the next aftershock. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS/ENCINO; ROAD CLOSURE URGED FOR SPECIFIC 
PERIODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists, homeowners and state parks officials urged a Los Angeles 
City Council committee Wednesday to close off a six-mile section of Mulholland 
Drive during brush fire season, heavy rains and during darkness hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to install gates and close Mulholland Drive between Santa Maria Road in 
Woodland Hills and Encino Hills Drive in Encino was discussed at a meeting of 
the city's Public Works committee.It is a plan supported by Councilman Marvin 
Braude, who represents the southwestern section of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The section of Mulholland Drive that is proposed to be temporarily closed is a 
dirt road adjacent to property owned by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, 
the Department of Water and Power, and the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation. It is mostly used by joggers and bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, fire officials and representatives of the conservancy have recommended 
that the road be closed during specific periods to reduce brush fire potential, 
illegal dumping and mud slide accidents during the rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal recommended by Braude, keys to the gate would be given to 
all local agencies requesting a key. The Santa Monica Mountain Conservancy 
would be responsible for closing and opening the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Friends of Caballero Canyon, the state Department of Park 
and Recreation and the Federation of Hillside and Canyon homeowners told the 
committee that they support Braude's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alarcon, chairman of the committee, decided to delay a 
decision on the proposal based on a recommendation by the city attorney's 
office, which said the closure plan cannot be approved until the entire city 
adopts a formal policy for road closures citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude's proposal is likely to be discussed again in Alarcon's committee in 
two weeks. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; CAFE OWNERS DROP EXPANSION PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of the Insomnia Cafe, a popular but controversy-dogged coffeehouse 
in Sherman Oaks, will not be opening a sister shop in Encino as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dunn, the cafe's owner, said that problems with his intended partners 
were responsible for the breakup of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was due to "partners who didn't come through with what they 
promised me," Dunn said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said the decision to pull the plug on what would have been the third 
Insomnia Cafe in Los Angeles -- the other one is on Beverly Boulevard near West 
Hollywood -- had nothing to do with rumblings from Encino homeowners, who 
feared it would generate the same noise and parking problems that have been 
attributed to the Sherman Oaks coffee shop.  
</P>
<P>
 "We could have worked things out with the neighbors," Dunn said. The owner had 
gone so far as to lease a building at 16344 Ventura Blvd. and install phones, 
which have since been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 In unrelated developments, Dunn and Michael Pulwer of Third Life Inc., the 
corporation that owns the Insomnia Cafe, are scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 
p.m. today in Van Nuys Municipal Court on criminal charges of failing to reduce 
the cafe's late-night hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A Municipal Court judge is expected to rule on Dunn's objection to the 
charges, called a demurrer, which argues that the complaint is defective.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Stone, Dunn's attorney, said he has discussed plea bargains with the 
city attorney handling the case. KAY HWANGBO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; JUDGE REFUSES ORDER BARRING CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO and JON NALICK and JODI WILGOREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County judge on Wednesday refused to order two local school 
districts not to give the state's controversial standardized tests to six 
objecting students, saying the issue is moot because the districts exempted the 
students from the tests, which have already been given. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state education officials said Wednesday that they will consider 
legal action against the Fullerton School District, which has refused to 
administer the tests, but not against Santa Ana Unified, which gave the tests 
and then voted to withhold them from the state in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversies all concern the California Learning Assessment System, which 
more than 1 million fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders in some 7,000 
schools are taking this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing in Municipal Court in Newport Beach on Wednesday morning, Judge 
Richard Luesebrink refused to prevent the Placentia-Yorba Linda and Tustin 
Unified school districts from giving CLAS to the six students, but only after 
the districts agreed to provide a 30-day warning to the complaining parents 
prior to any future testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although school districts are required by law to administer CLAS, most 
districts across the state -- including Placentia-Yorba Linda and Tustin -- 
have allowed parents to exempt their children from the test. The plaintiffs in 
the lawsuit did just that, but were concerned that the children might be tested 
in the future without their permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John A. Mendoza, who represented the plaintiffs, said his clients 
will now consider pursuing a claim for damages, arguing that several of the 
students' civil rights were violated when teachers gave them practice CLAS 
tests without parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Fullerton case, the school board Tuesday night reaffirmed its decision 
not to administer the tests despite state warnings that it must. Fullerton is 
one of six districts statewide not giving the tests, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Fullerton Supt. Duncan Johnson sent a letter to the state 
explaining that delays in sending the tests and mixed messages about whether 
students could be exempted led the district to its boycott.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the CLAS test as it now stands is building opposition, 
controversy and conflict," Johnson wrote. "The children of California deserve 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 But state Supt. of Public Instruction William D. Dawson responded with a 
letter reminding Johnson of the state law that mandates the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think they're totally disobeying the law," Department of Education 
spokeswoman Susie Lange said Wednesday. "We don't take that lightly. By 
refusing to give the test at all, (the district) has given parents no choice at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, thousands of students took the exams in reading, writing, math, 
science and social studies earlier this month, but school board members voted 
Tuesday to withhold the completed test booklets from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange said it is unlikely that the department would go after the test papers 
in court, but nonetheless criticized the district's move. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing is handicapping themselves," Lange said of Santa Ana. "The 
purpose of having a statewide exam is to provide one consistent measure that 
can be used from Eureka to San Diego . . . so the state taxpayer had some sense 
of an overall accountability on how the public school system performs." 
</P>
<P>
 By withholding the tests, Lange said, Santa Ana school board members are 
"depriving the community of any information on how they do compared to other 
students throughout the state." MIMI KO and JON NALICK and JODI WILGOREN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CATCHING KIDS IN THE ACT -- OF BEING GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most cities cite youngsters for breaking the law. In Buena Park, kids get 
tickets -- and burgers and ice cream -- for their good deeds. The Police 
Department has started a Safety Citation Program in which children and 
teen-agers caught in the act of obeying the law are rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's intended to recognize the good things that young kids do," said Police 
Chief Richard M. Tefank. "We want to reward the positive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Officer Robin Sells, who is coordinating the program, said officers on 
the street will give the citations to youngsters wearing a bicycle helmet, 
walking their bikes in a crosswalk and wearing a seat belt. Officers also will 
be on the lookout for safe and courteous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers then issue "tickets" good for a free McDonald's burger and fries, a 
Baskin-Robbins ice cream cone or a Shakey's mini-pizza. So far, eight local 
businesses and restaurants are sponsoring the program, which started last week, 
and are donating free meals or products, Sells said. Other sponsors are needed 
to support the Safety Citation Program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Officer Chris Nunez, who teaches a drug education 
program in local schools, said he saw a 5-year-old boy wearing his bike helmet. 
Nunez stopped the boy, who was with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see the concern on (the father's) face like 'Oh no, what did I do 
now?,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father was relieved to learn his son would be rewarded, Nunez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez said that once he explains to people why they are being stopped, "You 
see the smile on their face. It's fun to see the reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Sells agreed that the program is a way for youngsters to feel good about being 
approached by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the kids, and good for the officers to make somebody happy. 
We're used to giving tickets or arresting somebody -- and that doesn't make 
them happy," Sells said. "Now they can walk away with a good feeling."DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO MISSION VIEJO; 4 INJURED IN CRASH ON ORTEGA HIGHWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four people were injured in a head-on crash Tuesday morning on Ortega Highway 
seven miles east of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Robles, 18, of Ontario was driving west about 45 to 50 m.p.h. on the 
highway and lost control of the wheel at a slight curve, said Officer Bruce 
Lian of the Highway Patrol.The brown Audi that Robles was driving swerved onto 
the dirt area off the road and came back across the double yellow line into the 
opposing lane, crashing into a small Toyota pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred about 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles had a passenger, Amondo Barrera, 17, of Ontario. Lisa Theresa Sabatini, 
29, of Costa Mesa was driving the Toyota. She also had a passenger, Sandra 
Rosnagle, 34, of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Two ambulances, an Orange County fire engine and a paramedic van responded to 
the emergency, as did several CHP cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were treated at the scene and taken to Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles suffered a broken arm and a concussion, and Sabatini had a facial 
fracture, but both were reported in good condition, hospital spokeswoman Nancy 
Gascho said Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosnagle was released after treatment and Barrera was expected to be 
discharged soon. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness reported that the Audi had sped past him on the narrow highway 
earlier, Lian said. Robles was not immediately cited and the accident was under 
investigation.AILEEN CHO

 The parking garage has five stories and 491 parking spaces, and while it is 
intended for use by court employees, judges and jurors, city officials said 
that it will also help alleviate a parking crunch for visitors to the city 
center of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Completed in 11 months and only three weeks behind schedule -- because of 
winter rains and about $30,000 in damage from the Northridge earthquake -- the 
garage project goes hand-in-hand with a multimillion-dollar construction 
project by the county to expand the court building by 36,000 square feet and 
add security so the court can be used for felony trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the courthouse expansion is expected to be finished in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubler said that working in the courthouse is difficult because prisoners have 
to be housed so close to judges' chambers that it is sometimes difficult to 
talk over their yelling and occasional singing. 
</P>
<P>
 When the expansion is completed, Burbank judges will no longer have to send 
their felony cases to other jurisdictions for trial. Video arraignments will 
also be used in the expanded courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Deputy City Manager Richard R. Inga said that the parking garage is 
already earthquake-tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps," said Bob Michitsch, senior vice president for International 
Parking Design in Sherman Oaks, who said that all five levels of the garage had 
already been constructed when the Jan. 17 earthquake hit. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; TASTE TESTER CARRIES WEIGHTY RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "We dare not trust our wit for making our house pleasant for our friends, so 
we buy ice cream." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson  
</P>
<P>
 John Harrison may be the only man in the world who could claim a $1-million 
insurance payoff for putting too much Tabasco on his taco. 
</P>
<P>
 The official taste tester for Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Harrison's taste buds 
are insured for a cool $1 million, he told students at Valerio Street School in 
Van Nuys on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And with his employer paying the $6,000 annual premium for the policy, there's 
no Tabasco period. No smoking. No drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 300 gawking, open-mouthed students who were being rewarded with the 
ice cream treat because of their near-perfect attendance records, Harrison 
detailed not only the wine-like subtleties of ice cream, but also what is 
involved in such a sweet job. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, you taste (not eat -- there is a difference) three separate 
samples of 20 different ice creams each day. And as the youngsters quickly 
pointed out, that's 60 tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the company for 13 years, the man with the million-dollar mouth -- and no 
obvious indications of heart disease -- figured he'd done the tasting and 
approval for about 130 million gallons of the sweet stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends three or four hours each morning swirling the ice cream around his 
tongue, smacking his lips and inhaling deeply before spitting it out. Beginning 
with the lightest flavor -- vanilla -- so as not to overwhelm his pricey 
palate, he works his way through the heavier flavors like mint chocolate chip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my job to check on the top notes," he said, "the bouquet, the aroma." 
</P>
<P>
 He not only tastes the ice cream to make sure it meets standards, but also is 
in charge of maintaining flavor continuity. If, for example, Madagascar 
suffered a surprise and a devastating vanilla bean shortage, it would be up to 
Harrison to decide on vanilla from Borneo, Mexico or Tahiti -- the other 
vanilla giants -- or a combination thereof, to make the most pleasing treats. 
</P>
<P>
 His tongue, he explained, is "the last door" the product must go through 
before it hits the nation's freezers, and therefore a valuable protection 
device for the company. The $1-million insurance policy is a fun public 
relations gimmick, he said, but also serious business. 
</P>
<P>
 After relating fun ice cream facts -- people in the United States eat more 
than people from any other country, King Henry and Catherine De Medici were the 
first to make it with real cream -- he got down to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon finally drawing the gold-plated tasting spoon from his shirt pocket and 
dipping it into a scoop of marble fudge, the students groaned a groan of true 
envy. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point it was all interesting, several students said later, but it was 
time to put their newfound knowledge to the test. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Harrison asked how many licks it took on average to put away a full 
scoop, the voice from the back rang out without pause. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CANDIDATE STATEMENT FEE CLIMBS TO $750 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost for City Council contenders to place a statement in the voters 
pamphlet for the Nov. 8 election has increased, and city leaders say it could 
discourage people from running. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Alcene M. Cain told the City Council this week that candidates will 
be charged $750 to place their statements in the voters pamphlet.Cain said the 
fee, set by the county Registrar of Voters, is $300 more than that charged 
during the last municipal election in November, 1992. The statements are not 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune, who has not decided whether to seek reelection 
when her term ends in November, said the fee hike "is pretty significant" and 
could dissuade potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost increase is due to a requirement in the Federal Voting Rights Act 
that election materials be printed in Spanish and Vietnamese in addition to 
English, Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing period for candidates is July 18 to Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three open City Council seats, including those of Arthur C. Brown 
and Donna L. Chessen. Brown has announced his candidacy, and Chessen is a 
Democratic candidate for state Senate in the 34th District.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; ZONING LAW FOR ADULT BUSINESSES EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has extended for 10 1/2 months its temporary ordinance on 
zoning for adult businesses such as X-rated theaters and bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary law will allow the city time to complete a study for a permanent 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has held that cities may restrict adult businesses but 
may not outlaw them. The high court said the Constitution's First Amendment 
guarantee of freedom of speech protects such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the council members unanimously passed an ordinance that says 
the city is not intent on totally blocking adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of 
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative 
materials, including sexually oriented materials, that are protected by the 
First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the relevant provisions of the 
California State Constitution," the council's action stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance added: "The special regulation of adult-oriented businesses is 
necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to 
an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in 
which they are located or surrounding areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The interim law adopted by the council cites studies in other cities that have 
found dangerous situations when adult-oriented businesses are allowed to 
cluster in one location. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress' interim ordinance is designed "to prevent the concentration of 
adult-oriented businesses" and to regulate their nearness to such places as 
residences, schools and churches. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GROUP PLANS MORE GUATEMALAN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five volunteers will travel to Guatemala in July to distribute more 
than $1.6 million in medical supplies in that country. The trip is being 
planned by members of Xela Aid, an organization that has already sent materials 
twice in the past year to the town of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Xela Aid was founded a year ago by Leslie Baer-Brown after she traveled to 
Guatemala to study Spanish. Her reports of poverty spurred a group of her 
friends to help her organize the relief work, said Bob Rook, a coordinator of 
the upcoming trip. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Xela Aid medical and optometry teams have treated more than 
2,500 patients, built a house and worked on the construction of a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Rook and Baer-Brown have previously worked together to feed homeless and poor 
people in Los Angeles and Tijuana, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know anything about construction or medicine, but I knew about 
logistics," said Rook, who trains sales people in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was established in cooperation with the Los Angeles consular 
office of the Guatemalan government.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good program," Guatemalan Consul General Rafael Salazar said. He 
praised the program for buying construction materials and some medicines in 
Guatemala. "In this way, they support the local economy," Salazar said. "They 
bring only the things that they cannot find in Guatemala." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers plan to build a school house in July, teach agriculture and 
show villagers how to build solar-powered ovens, said Bob Rhein, a member of 
Xela Aid. The volunteer crew includes nurses and an optometry technician. The 
group will be joined by doctors and ophthalmologists from Guatemala City, Rhein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical supplies, which include antibiotics, vitamins, glaucoma medicine, 
eyeglasses and contraceptives, were donated by Direct Relief International, a 
Santa Barbara nonprofit organization, and also by Operation U.S.A., an 
international relief and development agency in Los Angeles, Rhein said. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous trip in December, 1993, brought more than 2,000 pairs of glasses 
and about $100,000 worth of medical supplies, Rhein said. The first Xela Aid 
trip, in July, 1993, also brought about $100,000 in medicine and other 
necessities, Rook said. Xela is the Maya name for the town of Quetzaltenango, 
Rhein said. Xela Aid meets at St. Matthew Church, 2207 W. Orangewood Ave. in 
Orange. WILLSON CUMMER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; TRAINING CENTER HAS HOME AFTER 77 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After 77 years of teaching in trailers, bungalows and borrowed classrooms, 
Glendale Community College's Adult Community Training Center finally has a home 
to call its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's new 20,000-square-foot building at 1122 E. Garfield Ave. will be 
dedicated Friday in a ceremony attended by Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead is scheduled to give center administrators an American flag that once 
flew over the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5-million facility, which administrators and support staff moved into 
April 18, will allow adult educators to better teach 12,000 Glendale residents 
who use the center's resources each year, said Lani DeVincentis, GCC dean of 
non-credit adult education.  
</P>
<P>
 Larger classrooms and computer labs in the new facility give teachers more 
room for equipment that was difficult to operate in temporary facilities, 
occupied by the center's classes since the adult education program began in 
1917, DeVincentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students ranging in age from 17 to 90 visit the center each year for schooling 
in English as a Second Language, business skills and training in basic reading, 
writing and math. The program also offers classes to prepare students to take 
tests for their General Equivalency Diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $1.6 million in state grant money helped administrators purchase the 
Garfield Avenue property, while funds from the Glendale Community College 
chancellor's office were used to build the facility. The center is operated as 
part of the college's non-credit program. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; SMOKING BAN GETS PRELIMINARY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given preliminary approval to a smoking ban in all 
publicly owned and operated facilities, ranging from City Hall to much of the 
Starlight Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved at next week's council meeting, the ban will take effect as early 
as July with the removal of ashtrays from municipal buildings and the posting 
of signs that prohibit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert R. Bowne questioned whether the preliminary vote should be 
taken because Susan Spanos, a councilwoman who smokes, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Bill Wiggins and Vice Mayor Dave Golonski were ready to approve the 
ordinance, although Councilman George Battey Jr. was also absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is one sentence in the staff report that says it all," Wiggins 
said. " 'Although it is not the city's place to control people's behavior, it 
is our responsibility to provide a positive and safe environment for our 
employees.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank joins a growing number of cities nationwide supporting smoking bans in 
public places. Smoking in Burbank is already prohibited in some City Hall 
offices and in places of general assembly, such as movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 A broad-based smoking ban was considered in 1991, but never came up for a vote 
by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance given preliminary approval on a 3-0 vote Tuesday prohibits 
smoking in city-owned vehicles and within 5 feet of any entrance or exit to a 
municipal building. City employees who violate the ban are subject to 
termination. 
</P>
<P>
 In other council action, Transportation Administrator G. William Lundgren got 
the go-ahead to look into whether the Glendale Beeline Metrolink shuttle system 
can be extended into Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The present service transporting passengers to and from Burbank's Metrolink 
station, the Media District and the Burbank Airport area will end Oct. 1.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; EXPANDED HEART CENTER IS DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A newly expanded heart center at Holy Cross Medical Center was dedicated 
Wednesday, and the unit hopes to serve San Fernando Valley patients who 
previously would have been referred to downtown hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,500-square-foot Holy Cross Heart Center, whose planned Valentine's Day 
dedication was delayed by the Northridge earthquake, will offer a complete 
range of specialized and general cardiac services, Chief Administrator Peter 
Spiers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have everything for the heart here." 
</P>
<P>
 There are two cardiac surgical suites and two other specialized labs in place, 
as well as a specialized team of physicians and support staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgical team, which has been operating since September, has already 
performed 108 surgeries, spokeswoman Jane Cessar said. The team will be able to 
perform about 300 surgeries a year and more than a thousand other heart-related 
procedures in the new wing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Spiers, the new unit had been planned for about 10 years, since 
hospital officials learned that as many as 50% of the area's heart patients had 
to go to Downtown Los Angeles because there wasn't enough specialized care in 
the Valley. ERIC SLATER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 23 years, the MEND Center has revived residents of the Northeast San 
Fernando Valley with distributions of food, clothing and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the nonprofit organization is getting ready to celebrate a little healing 
of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The MEND Center, short for Meet Each Need with Dignity, will celebrate its 
formal reopening June 2 after suffering $230,000 in damages in the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story, 10,000-square-foot structure was pummeled by the temblor, which 
ripped wide cracks in the interior and exterior walls and fouled up the 
plumbing and electrical systems. The building was yellow-tagged, and service to 
the residents of the community was relegated to a tent in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilding effort was directed by Kaufman and Broad, a development firm 
that volunteered to oversee subcontractors and negotiated reduced rates for 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the reopening ceremony, MEND organizers will honor the developers, City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon and others in the community who offered donations or 
services to the organization after the quake ravaged its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult in one sense; we had to flex all of our operations," 
said MEND Executive Director Marianne Havel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the positive side was that the outpouring of support from the community 
was just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, which is open to the public, will be held at 10 a.m. at 13460 
Van Nuys Blvd. 
</P>

MISSION VIEJO CHECKING OUT PLAN FOR ITS OWN LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired of what City Councilman Robert D. Breton called Wednesday a "miserable 
little library" with a "Flintstones book collection," the city is completing 
its plans to leave the Orange County Public Library system and build its own 
$6-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In a discussion this week, the council settled on leaving the county system by 
year's end, becoming the first city in Orange County to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is right," Mayor Susan Withrow said. "It's important for Mission 
Viejo at this time to consider providing increased library services." 
</P>
<P>
 What's promising to make the move possible is a land swap under negotiation 
with the Mission Viejo Co. and Staubach Co. under which the city would get 
three acres near the new library site in exchange for city-owned land near City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would make enough profit under the exchange to afford to build a new 
library that would replace the current 9,000-square-foot library on Chrisanta 
Drive that contains about 87,000 volumes and is open 31 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials envision a 25,000-square-foot facility in the center of town on 
La Paz Road, open 65 hours a week, with at least 40 special programs and 
120,000 to 150,000 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo is trying to finalize an agreement with the county to keep the 
$970,000 the city pays in property taxes for library services in order to meet 
operating costs for the new library, Breton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has been discussing ways to fund the estimated $1.6 million it 
would take to run the library annually, including volunteer programs and 
offering voters the option of paying a little extra tax each year for an 
"information superhighway" system -- CD-ROM, Internet and Lexis/Nexis, for 
example -- to be built in the new library. 
</P>
<P>
 The county expressed restrained support for Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that while the City Council clearly wants to obtain more control over 
the quality . . . we could continue to cooperate with them on a contract 
basis," said John Adams, the county librarian. "Everybody involved ultimately 
wants to see the best quality library service. If Mission Viejo is able to 
devote greater resources . . . then I certainly think it's a good decision." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was his understanding that the city and county are still talking 
about the city's proposed departure from the library system. But city officials 
seemed certain about the inevitability of the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The handwriting's on the wall," Breton said.

$28 MILLION IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDS GET OK; TRANSIT: HOUSE PASSES LEGISLATION 
FOR COUNTY PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE A MASSIVE GARAGE FOR DISNEYLAND RESORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed legislation that authorizes 
up to $28 million for Orange County transportation projects, including a 
massive parking structure the Walt Disney Co. says it needs if it decides to 
build the Disneyland Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Highway System Designation Act includes $15 million to construct 
on- and off-ramps to the San Diego Freeway and Costa Mesa Freeway connectors in 
Costa Mesa. It would also help build the garage that would be owned and 
operated by county officials but would be used to provide parking for 
Disneyland tourists while Westcot is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill includes $3 million for a Bristol Street improvement project in Santa 
Ana and a $10-million line of credit to support the Eastern Transportation 
Corridor, a planned tollway connecting the Riverside Freeway with the Santa Ana 
Freeway that would carry 52,000 cars on opening day and up to 117,000 cars per 
day in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County communities have aggressively sought to solve some of the most 
overwhelming transportation problems in the country," said Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove). "The legislation passed by the House supports their 
efforts to bring an end to gridlock and congestion that cost our region 
billions of dollars each year." 
</P>
<P>
 While the three projects are considered vital to the county's transportation 
future, the most talked about is by far the 12,000-space Disney garage that 
would allow Disneyland to remain open when -- and if -- the $3-billion 
expansion is built. The Walt Disney Co. has yet to commit to that project, 
which includes more than 5,000 hotel rooms, an amphitheater, a shopping 
district and a new theme park next to Disneyland called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the money is still far from delivered. The House authorization is only the 
first in a two-step process, and the money must still be appropriated in 
another bill, which could come up as early as today. If approved there, it goes 
to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $15.5 million was allocated last year for the same projects but 
has yet to be spent. If the new money is approved, it would mean that about 10% 
of the projects' $318-million tab would be paid for by the federal government.

WONDER GIRL; PIERCE COLLEGE GRADUATE IS WISE BEYOND HER 15 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Pierce College accounting professor asked which of his students would 
like to join him for a traditional end-of-semester cocktail a few weeks ago, 
they all raised their hands -- all except Kissandra Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't being a prude. She's 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he even noticed," said Kissandra, who graduates from Pierce 
today. "I try to keep a low profile about how old I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Tall for her age, the perky, blonde prodigy with braces has been way ahead of 
her peers since she was a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents and grandmother show visitors to their gated, west San Fernando 
Valley home a videotape of Kissandra at age 2 reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance, answering questions in Spanish and learning to read. By the time 
she was 4, Kissandra was in first grade at the since-closed Egremont School in 
Encino, playing violin and acting in her first TV commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10, still three years younger than most of her classmates, she began taking 
classes in calculus at UCLA. At 15, she is now ready to enter a four-year 
college as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do all the brains come from? 
</P>
<P>
 "Me!" chimes grandmother Edith Landan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me!" says her mother, P.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissandra's father, Michael Cohen, puts a hand to his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started reading to her when she was about 9 months old," he says. "And we 
always talked to her a lot, as though she were an adult, without using baby 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cohens have two other children-Kandy, 11, and Kory, 5 -- both also 
advanced for their ages. But it is Kissandra who has so far received most of 
the accolades, with parts in two TV programs, a singing performance at a Los 
Angeles Clippers game and acceptance to Cornell, Smith and UC Berkeley under 
her belt. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest thing for Kissandra may be balancing her adult academic pursuits 
with her teen-age social life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to deal with jealousy all my life," Kissandra said. "There are 
people in the world who are used to everything conforming and are threatened by 
someone who does something different. But I don't let it faze me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the low profile in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "At school, she's quiet and docile -- a different person than elsewhere," said 
Pierce statistics professor Dick Anderson, who has become friends with the 
Cohens. "I've seen her with her friends, and she's like a young Goldie Hawn -- 
quite an entertainer." 
</P>
<P>
 Kissandra hopes to turn her entertainer side and her skills in math and logic 
into a career as a lawyer or, perhaps, a politician. "I could be the first 
woman President," she said. "Sounds good, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 First she has to finish school, and no decision has been made about where she 
will study next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is," Kissandra said, "I can't drive."

AROUND THE VALLEY: HIGH-RISE WORKERS STEEL THEMSELVES AS TOWERS OF POWER SHAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nowadays around the earthquake-rattled San Fernando Valley, working in a 
building made of steel may require nerves of the same material. That, or a 
small dose of denial. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of both works for Chris Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't visualize this whole building collapsing," said a slightly 
apprehensive Hickman, his eyes roaming the walls of the deli where he works on 
the bottom floor of one of the twin 18-story towers at Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "But having said that," Hickman continued briskly with a shrug, "life goes 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it does for thousands of employees in steel-frame buildings across Los 
Angeles, even though at least 50 such structures -- once thought invulnerable 
to Mother Nature's tantrums -- have sprouted cracks in their skeletons since 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have grown concerned enough about the damage that the Los Angeles 
City Council last week gave notice that it will order inspections of 400 
steel-frame buildings throughout the Valley and the West Side, the two areas of 
the city hardest hit by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But concern over the potential weaknesses in steel-frame buildings seems 
greater in the halls of officialdom than in the corridors of the buildings 
themselves, where the 9-to-5 life barely pauses and the gossip at the water 
cooler has returned to the subject of office intrigue rather than office 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you do? You have to make a living," said Evelyn Casillas, who works 
with the Greater Valley Medical Group in a steel-frame building in Mission 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put it out of my mind. I'd rather not think about it," Casillas said of the 
internal damage to her Rinaldi Street office building, whose owners have 
notified the city of their intent to repair cracks in the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar outlook can be found in the offices stacked one upon the other in 
the Warner Center towers in Woodland Hills. The complex's parking structure was 
heavily damaged in the quake, and workers in some suites detected hairline 
cracks in their walls once the overturned file cabinets, shattered wall 
hangings, fallen plaster and smashed computers were uprighted or cleared away. 
</P>
<P>
 From 5% to 10% of the joints in the steel-frame twin towers were fractured in 
the quake, a statistic Doris Prouty banishes from her thoughts at her desk on 
the 17th floor -- just below the crown of one of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought about it, it would be too hard to come to work every day. I 
don't know if that's the best way to deal with it," said Prouty, a program 
secretary with the California Wellness Foundation. "I keep thinking, 'We've had 
the Big One, and there won't be another one for 20 years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the tower held up far better compared to her Northridge house, which 
was virtually destroyed in the quake. Indeed, some Warner Center employees say, 
the fact that the high-rise is still standing, and that 90% of the joints came 
through without incident, is enough reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it can withstand that big an earthquake, it can withstand just about 
anything," said Hope Shankle, a production analyst with an insurance company on 
the sixth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel safer here than at home, and we're on the 16th floor," said Jodie 
Atkinson during a break from her job as an accounts-payable supervisor for the 
Windsor Capital Group. "Maybe it's the sight-unseen kind of thing. You don't 
see" the joint damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Caretakers of the Warner Center towers say repairs to the two high-rises -- 
known as the Trillium -- have been under way for several weeks and should be 
completed by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically have just a few more weld repairs to make, and we will be done. 
We've been more pro-active than most owners in discovering whether (we) had any 
of that damage," said Mike Krier of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management 
in Irvine, the asset manager for the towers. 
</P>
<P>
 To fix the joints, workers must burrow into walls and above ceilings. Some 
owners of damaged buildings fear that the cost of inspections and repairs -- 
which can require the use of ultrasonic equipment -- may be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not cheap," agreed Krier, who declined to disclose how much the Trillium 
repairs have cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, steel frames have become popular with architects and builders 
because they are designed to bend without breaking in earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, despite cracks in some buildings, no steel-frame structure came 
close to collapsing in the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But total faith in steel is another item on the list of things shaken by the 
quake for Hickman, the deli employee. A structural engineer by training in his 
native England, Hickman moved to the United States to be with his fiancee just 
a few months before the Pretty Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what the joints are like. I assumed they were all right," Hickman 
said. "To visualize cracks in the steel is kind of terrifying."

SANITATION AGENCY LAWYERS DENY EVASION 
</P>

 An Orange County Sanitation Districts inspector was not instructed to withhold 
information from state officials investigating a fatal fire at the agency's 
Huntington Beach treatment plant, according to a report issued by sanitation 
agency attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation agency's written response to its board of directors on 
Wednesday came more than a week after California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration investigators reported that inspector Larry Wayne McLemore had 
been told not to disclose information about the possible cause of the Feb. 1 
fire that killed two workers, because it "could be embarrassing or 
incriminating" to the districts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a transcript of McLemore's February meeting with Cal/OSHA 
investigators, which was made public Wednesday, the sanitation inspector said 
he did not know the cause of the fire. He said he was only instructed by 
sanitation agency attorneys not to speculate about a possible cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Two workers for an Ontario-based engineering firm were killed in the fire, 
which is being investigated by Cal/OSHA's Bureau of Investigation. KEVIN

STATE WORKERS SALUTED FOR POST-QUAKE SERVICE; VOLUNTEERISM: SOME HEALTH AND 
WELFARE AGENCY EMPLOYEES LEFT THEIR REGULAR JOBS TO ASSIST VICTIMS OF JAN. 17 
TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Nearly 100 state employees were recognized Wednesday by state Health and 
Welfare Agency officials for volunteering to temporarily leave their families 
and regular jobs to assist victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief ceremony at the state government building in Van Nuys, Health 
and Welfare Secretary Sandra R. Smoley thanked the employees from the agency's 
12 departments for making sacrifices to help other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this disaster, I can honestly say that state government worked," Smoley 
said. "I think they'll all come back as better employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Anderson, director of the Department of Social Services, also thanked 
the employees who stayed behind and performed the additional duties of those 
who had temporarily left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give your co-workers who picked up the slack a little hug," Anderson told the 
crowd of about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 After assisting victims of the disaster, many of the employees went back to 
their regular jobs invigorated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experience broadened my understanding of people," said Miguel Perez, 46, 
of Northridge, who temporarily left his job as a vocational counselor with the 
Department of Rehabilitation to help coordinate transportation and couriers for 
the application centers. "There are a lot of brave people out there." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 employees from the Los Angeles area and offices throughout the 
state volunteered to work for two to six weeks, mostly at disaster application 
centers set up immediately after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most worked at the centers explaining the state's Individual and Family Grant 
Program, a last-resort assistance program for victims who do not qualify for 
Small Business Administration loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May 22, more than 167,000 applications have been received for the state 
grant program. Of those, 47,600 have been processed and nearly $40 million in 
grants has been awarded, according to Liz Brady, a spokeswoman for the 
Department of Social Services.

MAN FATALLY SHOT, YOUNG BROTHER HURT; VIOLENCE: VICTIM HAD SAID GANG MEMBERS 
WERE STALKING HIM. HE WAS PLANNING TO MOVE TO MEXICO TO ESCAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 20-year-old man who told his family he wanted to move to Mexico to get away 
from gang life was killed and his younger brother was wounded Tuesday night in 
what police said was a gang-related drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police spokesman Dick Faust said the dead man, Jesse Bonilla, and 
his 12-year-old brother were fixing the radio in Bonilla's car about 11:47 p.m. 
in front of their house in the 1300 block of Tolliver Street when the shooting 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust said a brown vehicle drove past and someone fired several rounds from a 
semiautomatic weapon, hitting Bonilla in the back of the head and his brother 
in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla died at the scene. His brother, whose name was not released, was taken 
to UCI Medical Center, where he was reported in stable condition, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle involved in the shooting was last seen traveling west on Tolliver 
Street at high speed, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Bob Helton said that Bonilla was a known gang member but that 
investigators did not know the reason for the shootings. Helton said the young 
brother is not a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla's family and friends said Wednesday that Bonilla turned to religion 
and was no longer in a gang, a life he had pursued off and on since dropping 
out of high school about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives said he knew that leaving that lifestyle is easier said than 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last year, Bonilla had kept saying it was just a matter of time before 
gang members would make good their threats to kill him, said his sister, Maria 
del Carmen Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 He told her that gang members had jumped him once and promised to kill him the 
next time. But she could not offer a reason for threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear of violence was behind Bonilla's plan to move to Mexico, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been looking for him for a while -- this time they got him," said 
Maria del Carmen Bonilla, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, she nervously peered out the window of her home every time a car 
passed, checking on her 2-year-old nephew playing in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and her mother were in the kitchen when they heard the shots 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one thought it could have been (Bonilla), but when my sister went outside 
to (check), she started screaming, 'Mom, they shot him! Mom, they shot him!' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her brother had been working in construction trying to earn enough 
money for the trip to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd been doing pretty good with the job and helping out around the house," 
she said. "It just seems like a dream to everyone. We just can't believe" that 
he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members "wanted to get him," she said. "They . . . hated him. My brother 
knew it was just a matter of time."

PALMDALE AIRPORT BOOSTERS SEEK A WAY TO LURE AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Palmdale Regional Airport is ever going to take off, the community needs to 
use it, according to supporters who are searching for ways to lure more 
airlines to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by the city of Los Angeles, the airport has struggled over the years as 
a series of mostly small airlines have come and gone after typically short 
stays. In the mid- to late-1980s, the terminal even went unused. 
</P>
<P>
 At a gathering Wednesday of the airport's booster club -- the Palmdale 
Regional Airport Advisory Council -- members agreed that the airport is an 
important part of the Antelope Valley's vital transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, however, is convincing airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do something," said airport supporter Paul Heindel. "We're the 
key." 
</P>
<P>
 Determining that something is what airport supporters are grappling with. 
</P>
<P>
 Heindel said that part of the problem is that airline carriers still perceive 
the Antelope Valley as a remote, sparsely populated area and are slow to make 
themselves available to even talk about servicing the Palmdale airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one carrier is operating out of the lone terminal at Palmdale Regional 
Airport. New Mexico-based Mesa Airlines, operating at the airport as United 
Express, was left as the sole carrier March 1, when SkyWest Airlines 
discontinued service after nearly four years in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Eaton, Mesa's station manager in Palmdale, said the airline is doing 
well, particularly since SkyWest pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mesa's offerings are limited, with flights available only between Palmdale 
and Los Angeles International Airport, where a connecting flight to other 
destinations may be caught. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Lancaster and Palmdale agree that the airport is an important 
component of the region's transportation network. The question of air service 
invariably is raised by companies considering relocating to the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have transportation connections, you have limited opportunity 
for economic growth," said Steve Dukett, Lancaster's redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles in the late 1960s purchased nearly 18,000 acres of 
desert in Palmdale for what the Department of Airports envisioned as an 
intercontinental airport.

ELECTIONS / SCHOOL BOND MEASURE; 3 COLLEGE PRESIDENTS URGE OK OF PROP. 1C 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The presidents of three crowded community colleges in the Santa Clarita, 
Antelope and Victor valleys joined forces Wednesday to urge approval of a June 
7 bond measure that would pay for new school buildings and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrators warned that more businesses will flee California unless the 
state's community colleges can expand to educate more young people and retrain 
workers who have lost their jobs in aerospace and other fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must do something dramatic to turn the state's economy around," said 
Dianne Van Hook, president of College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that because of a lack of space, her college is turning away 4,000 
students per semester. "We really need to be able to accommodate those 
students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook was joined by Allan Kurki, president of Antelope Valley College in 
Lancaster, and Edward Gould, president of Victor Valley College in Victorville, 
who reported similar space problems and also called for adoption of the bond 
measure, Proposition 1C. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrators said they represent three of California's four 
fastest-growing community college districts, as measured by the percentage 
change in the adult population between 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The presidents spoke to reporters inside Antelope Valley College's nearly 
completed library, financed by $6 million from a previous state bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building is a perfect example of what happens if a proposition such as 
1C passes," Kurki said. "We couldn't think of a more appropriate place." 
</P>
<P>
 The college officials said adoption of the bond measure is not a sure thing 
because recession-weary voters may not want to increase the state's debt -- a 
debt they will have to help pay. The educators also admitted that many 
residents in their districts are fiscally conservative and have voted against 
past bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a campaign that is going to be won very easily," Gould said. "The 
polls show it right now as nip and tuck." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by a simple majority of those who vote in the election, 
Proposition 1C would allow the state to raise $900 million through bond sales. 
The money would be used to strengthen and upgrade existing buildings and 
construct new ones at California's public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying back the principal and interest over about 25 years would cost $1.6 
billion, the state's legislative analyst's office has estimated. Local college 
officials, seeking to make that debt sound less burdensome, said it will cost 
each taxpayer less than $2 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bond measure is approved, the three colleges are each expected to 
receive a share during the 1994-95 fiscal year for new library equipment, 
remodeling projects, safety improvements and better access for people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current estimates, Antelope Valley would get about $4 million, College 
of the Canyons would receive about $6 million and $1.4 million would go to 
Victor Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In published ballot arguments opposing the measure, several critics, including 
members of the Libertarian Party, said the state is already carrying too large 
a bond debt. They also questioned whether the colleges will have enough money 
to staff the new buildings financed by the bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurki acknowledged that Proposition 1C would not provide more money for 
operating expenses. But he insisted that California colleges must continue to 
improve their buildings and put up new ones to prepare for the time when more 
money for staffing is available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply can't let ourselves get discouraged and stop building simply 
because we have a recessionary phase going on," he said. "We need to have the 
physical facilities."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BODY IDENTIFIED AS MURDER VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a Palmdale woman found last week by a freight train engineer was 
identified as murder victim by investigators who said the woman was stabbed 
numerous times and that her throat was slashed "ear to ear," authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Patricia Tavra, 23, was dropped off by friends at a Texaco gas station at 
the intersection of 5th Street East and Palmdale Boulevard about 11:15 p.m. on 
May 6, said Deputy Angie McLaughlin, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Her badly decomposed body was discovered 12 days later by a Southern Pacific 
train engineer who saw a body underneath a clump of bushes next to the tracks, 
authorities said. A coroner's spokesman said the body was identified through 
fingerprint records. 
</P>
<P>
 After the engineer spotted the body, he notified a ground crew to check the 
tracks near the intersection of Avenue R-8 and 10th Street East, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Victoria, the victim's live-in boyfriend, said Tavra never returned to 
the house after the night of May 6, McLaughlin said. McLaughlin said Tavra, who 
had a criminal record for prostitution, drug use and theft, had used a dozen 
aliases in the past.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA BACKS MILDER ORDINANCE AGAINST 
SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A filtered version of a tobacco control ordinance here bans smoking in most 
workplaces, prohibits cigarette vending machines and is set to take effect Aug. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to approve first 
reading of the ordinance with lesser restrictions than when it was adopted five 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking is banned in enclosed workplaces but permitted in restaurants and bars 
as long as the establishment's policy is posted for customers. Cigarette 
vending machines are prohibited citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses operated away from the public and not sharing ventilation 
systems with another office may allow smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have been flooded with data and arguments from advocates on 
both sides since the issue was raised in late 1993. Ban supporters say people's 
health is at stake, while opponents say it's a question of personal freedom and 
that merchants should be able to set their own smoking policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Tuesday was a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Pederson earlier opposed the ordinance, saying it didn't go far 
enough to protect residents from secondhand smoke. Councilwoman Jan Heidt was 
against it for a different reason, saying businesses should be allowed to 
regulate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved first reading of a stricter version in December but 
backed off of final approval when 200 people -- some residents, some merchants 
and many from outside of the Santa Clarita Valley wanting to express their 
views on smoking -- showed up to debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier draft banned smoking in all enclosed public areas, except bars 
with only one-fourth of their income from food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was happy with the compromise, including resident Donna Pugh, who 
first asked for smoking controls in the workplace. She believed that eating 
establishments should be treated the same as other job sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't believe restaurants aren't a workplace," Pugh told the council. 
"No one will convince me of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The ban will appear for a second reading by the council June 14 and, barring 
another last-minute change by the council, would go into effect Aug. 1.

COUNTY TERMINATES CONTRACT WITH CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county this week abruptly terminated its contract with the only clinic 
that provides mental health services to Spanish speakers, hired away its staff 
and opened a temporary clinic to serve its clients, an official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, which had contracted with Santa Ana's Clinica Nueva Esperanza, 
took the action because the clinic was on the verge of bankruptcy and failed to 
meet several key contract requirements, officials said. The contract with with 
clinic was to run through June 30, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday evening, county officials had packed up the clinic's records, hired 
its clinical staff and two receptionists on a part-time basis, and moved the 
operation to several empty rooms at the county medical clinic at 1200 N. Main 
St., said Teresa McFarland, program manager for adult community services with 
the county's mental health office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a number of problems at Nueva Esperanza. We reached a point a 
few weeks ago where they were understaffed and very close to bankruptcy, so we 
exercised our right to do a five-day termination of the contract," McFarland 
said. "The clients weren't receiving services." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Moreno, who co-founded the clinic 20 years ago as Clinica Ometochli and 
is a current board member, said the clinic is reorganizing and seeking other 
funding so it can keep its doors open as a nonprofit mental health service 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty serious blow. To regroup that type of funding is going to take 
a little bit of work and commitment from the community, and people coming in to 
support the Clinica, but I don't have a doubt that we will be going in that 
direction," Moreno said. "Unfortunately, we depended too much on county funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said that for now, all clients will be referred to the county, and that 
the clinic is trying to restaff. He said it was difficult for the clinic to 
meet county requirements with the kind of funding it was receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic received about $473,000 this year from the county, the same as last 
year, McFarland said. The bulk of the clinic's funding was from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 She emphasized that the county remains dedicated to providing culturally 
sensitive mental health services geared specifically to Spanish speakers. In 
fact, the county has increased its grant amount for the 1994-95 year by 
$100,000, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that the program is really essential," McFarland said. "We thought 
that we could serve the (Spanish-speaking) clients in our regular clinics, but 
we did an audit back in November and we realized that there really are clients 
out there who would fall through the cracks. They need to be served in a 
community-based setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Three agencies, including Clinica Nueva Esperanza, are bidding to provide 
those services. The contract went to a bidding process this year because the 
county is obligated to seek bids on contracts every three years in order to 
avoid "sweetheart deals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county had considered funding Clinica Nueva Esperanza through the end of 
October, when the winning bidder takes over. But problems at the clinic in 
recent weeks had escalated, with the clinic's therapists walking out in protest 
over pay problems, McFarland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county hired the clinic's staff because they are familiar with their 
clients' cases, McFarland said. The clinic serves about 400 people, she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA DISPUTES NEW CRIME STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has promoted itself as one of the five safest in the nation in recent 
years, but a study by a national magazine currently ranks Santa Clarita 47th 
out of 187 cities with more than 100,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The study published in the June edition of Money Magazine is based on 
statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that total the number of 
murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in each city during 1993, 
said Ira Hellman, a spokesman for the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said they were surprised by the results of the first-year 
study and questioned its accuracy. All said they felt Santa Clarita is a safe 
place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night you see people out there walking and jogging -- families," said 
Marv Dixon, operations lieutenant of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's 
Station. "That speaks strongly, I think, to the level of fear people have." 
</P>
<P>
 The city reported a 4.9% increase in serious crimes during 1993. Serious gang 
crimes tripled in the Santa Clarita Valley, which includes unincorporated areas 
around the city of Santa Clarita. Sheriff's officials attributed some of the 
increase to better record-keeping.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita, with about 125,000 residents, still had the fifth fewest crimes 
last year among U.S. cities with more than 100,000 residents, according to FBI 
figures released at the end of the 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 But that measured only the number of crimes committed, not the ratio of crimes 
per resident, so larger cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco had much 
higher totals regardless of their crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI's statistics include four categories not used in the magazine's 
article: burglary, motor vehicle theft, arson and larceny -- all crimes against 
property rather than a person, Hellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson said he feels the categories in Money's 
article are the most valid ways to gauge personal safety in each community. But 
he added that he isn't ready to accept their findings at face value, since 
there is no previous study by the magazine with which to compare figures. He 
said if the study is accurate, the city still fared well. 
</P>
<P>
 "That puts us in the top third, almost the top fourth," he said. "I think 
we're in pretty good company." 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson said Santa Clarita's crime rate is still much lower than many 
surrounding communities in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The method each city uses to report its crime data needs to be analyzed before 
any definite conclusions can be made from the study, Dixon said. He said the 
assault totals at his station includeincidents that might not be reported by 
other jurisdictions, such as domestic disputes.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY HALVES $1,000 REWARD FOR GRAFFITI VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $1,000 reward for turning in graffiti vandals has been cut in half, but city 
officials here say it won't hurt the program that has led to 25 arrests since 
it began last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in April, 1993, the program has paid rewards in $250 increments 
for information about anyone placing graffiti in the city, up to a maximum of 
$1,000 if a suspect is ultimately convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has awarded $11,500 to 13 people since the program began. About 
25 people have been arrested and convicted from information obtained via the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday night capped the reward at $500 at the suggestion 
of the public works department that administers the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents turning in suspected vandals have not done it for the money, 
according to Jeff Kolin, deputy city manager and public works director.  
</P>
<P>
 "They felt the money wasn't the thing," said Kolin, who discussed the reward 
with the city's anti-gang task force and a volunteer cleanup group before 
suggesting the $500 cap. "It was the pride in the community and a desire to 
deal with the graffiti issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the truth," agreed Sgt. Lee White, head of the Santa Clarita Valley 
sheriff's station anti-gang unit. "I don't think anything will change. These 
people that are doing it, it's their way of giving to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has budgeted $6,000 for graffiti rewards for the upcoming fiscal 
year, and Kolin expects all of it to be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 City staffers will review the success of the program with the lowered reward 
and return in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city's Teen Spring Clean held last weekend is any indication, the 
reward program will not break Santa Clarita's budget no matter how much is 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers struggled to find enough graffiti to keep 60 volunteers busy for an 
entire morning.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BRIEF CONTENDS TRUSTEES DEFIED STATE LAW IN 
REFUSING CLAS TEST; EDUCATION: ANTELOPE VALLEY DECISION VIOLATED RIGHTS OF 
PARENTS AND STUDENTS, THE DOCUMENT STATES. DISTRICT ATTORNEYS SAY THERE IS NO 
LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE EXAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trustees of the Antelope Valley Union High School District engaged in "an act 
of mutiny" last month when they voted to not administer the controversial 
statewide student assessment test, according to a brief filed Wednesday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides rebelling against state law, the board's decision to not give CLAS 
violates the rights of parents and students, according to the brief filed on 
behalf of the parents of three Quartz Hill High School 10th-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 "By defying state law," the brief states, the district has "embarked upon a 
divisive course of action that denies children access to the information to be 
learned from taking the assessment tests and denies parents access to 
information necessary to judge the school system's performance and the progress 
of their children in school." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-page brief was filed by People For the American Way in support of the 
state Department of Education, which earlier this month sued the high school 
district over its refusal to give the California Learning Assessment System 
test. The lawsuit seeks a court order mandating that the district administer 
CLAS. A hearing is set for June 6 in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, attorneys representing the high school district filed their 
response to the lawsuit, arguing that there is no legal requirement that CLAS 
be given. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we read the statute that says school districts are supposed to give this 
test, it says we're supposed to give it in accordance with rules and 
regulations adopted by the state Board of Education," said Frank J. Fekete, an 
attorney for the school district. "We have no evidence the state board has 
adopted rules and regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials have repeatedly argued that every district in the 
state is required to administer the test, which is being given this year to 
more than 1 million students in the fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Education attorney Allan Keown declined to comment on either of 
Wednesday's filings. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS has been praised by its supporters as a revolutionary method of testing 
the critical thinking skills of students. Opponents, including the Antelope 
Valley school board, argue that the test violates the privacy rights of 
students and parents, contains passages that denigrate the family and is 
unnecessarily shrouded in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school board voted April 20 to not administer the test, becoming the 
first in the state to notify the Department of Education that it would not give 
CLAS. In all, there are six school districts, including Acton-Agua Dulce 
Unified, among the more than 1,000 in the state that have decided against 
administering the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Keown said additional lawsuits may be filed against the other districts as 
early as next week if they continue to refuse to give CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Fekete said the arguments set forth in the filing he submitted to the court 
Wednesday on behalf of the Antelope Valley district gets to the key problem 
with CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one sense, it's a technical argument," he said. "In another sense, it goes 
to the heart of the problem with this test, which is secrecy. Not just secrecy 
with the test, but with the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had done this thing the way the Legislature had expected them to do, 
adopting rules and regulations in public, they could have solved these 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Fekete expects the state will respond by saying the rules and regulations they 
already have related to assessment tests are sufficient. "But they're not," he 
said.

FATE OF STREISAND O.C. CONCERTS IS EXPECTED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN and RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As an air of disappointment and anticipation hangs over Barbra Streisand's 
fans, an announcement is expected today regarding the rescheduling of her 
canceled opening at The Pond of Anaheim and the fate of her remaining five 
concerts here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more distraught than when Nixon died," said Don Higgins of Huntington 
Beach, a sign maker who spent $275 and four hours in line for tickets to 
Wednesday's concert for himself and his wife, Gloria, who runs a child-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer canceled Wednesday's show because of a bout of viral tracheal 
laryngitis. Her representatives said the show most likely will be rescheduled. 
"Those with tickets, hold onto them," urged Anne Bendheim, a spokeswoman for 
the promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Wednesday night, there still was no official word about a new date or 
about the rest of the Anaheim engagement (the next show is scheduled Friday 
night). Officials said they wanted to wait another day to see if Streisand's 
condition improves. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand was resting at her Beverly Hills home. She reportedly had been 
ailing for several days before deciding on doctors' orders to postpone. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's under medication, and she has been ordered to maintain strict voice 
rest," said one of her spokesmen. "That means no talking at all, and obviously 
no singing." 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation caused a ripple effect among businesses in the area, from 
restaurants to limousine services. As one fan said: "It's amazing how one case 
of laryngitis can affect so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it's been horrible!" said Debbie Marshall, co-owner of Mr. Stox in 
Anaheim. A week ago, the restaurant had Wednesday night reservations for all 
300 of its seats, having offered a special hassle-free package: Park for free, 
chow down, then, for $6, hop a "luxury" bus for the one-mile ride to The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 By 8 Wednesday morning, restaurant employees were on the phone, calling 
everyone with a reservation, including one unhappy couple who had flown from 
New York just for the concert and who couldn't stay around. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they'd bought their plane tickets way in advance and would be 
leaving town," Marshall said, adding: "I feel sorry for all the people who had 
limos already ordered." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some who'd booked a stretch with Ultimate Limousine were feeling sorry 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had two couples flying in from Arizona on a private jet," said Ultimate 
owner Andy Wagner, who had about a dozen reservations for the evening. "We were 
going to pick them up from the airport, take them to dinner, then to the 
concert, then afterward maybe a little sightseeing, then back to the airport. 
This ruined their day." 
</P>
<P>
 At The Pond Wednesday morning, box office and administrative staff answered a 
constant barrage of phone queries about the cancellation, even as workers 
continued to ready Streisand's dressing room and technicians checked the sound 
inside the arena, where the stage and floor seats already were in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, ticket holders made their way in a small but steady stream to the one 
box office window that was open. "I'm disappointed because I was thinking I'd 
be here for opening night," said Myra Ross of Irvine, who remained confident 
that the show would be rescheduled and not canceled outright. 
</P>
<P>
 It made no difference to Kenneth and Alice Wright of Manchester, England. They 
had hoped Streisand would be the final treat of a three-week U.S. vacation, but 
because they must fly back home early Saturday morning, they -- like the couple

 "I'm awfully disappointed, you know," said Alice, who stood outside the box 
office holding up the cash she'd just been refunded. "There's the money. I'd 
rip it up if I could see her.

 Meanwhile, at a boutique of Streisand merchandise at the Bullock's store at 
South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, fans expressed anxiety about the remaining 
concerts while browsing through items that ranged from $25 T-shirts to $400 
jackets.

 "At this point," said Ellen Abel of Costa Mesa, who has tickets to Friday's 
show, "I'm praying."

STILL RIDING A 30-YEAR CREST, SURF FILMMAKER HANGS 'II'; LIFESTYLE: SEQUEL TO 
1963 CLASSIC 'ENDLESS SUMMER' MIRRORS SEA CHANGE IN SPORT THE ORIGINAL HELPED 
POPULARIZE.

 Three decades after his classic film "Endless Summer" introduced surfing to 
the landlocked masses and earned him critical accolades as "the Bergman of the 
boards" and "the Fellini of the foam," legendary surf filmmaker Bruce Brown is 
back at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Endless Summer II" -- the world's first surf documentary to be shot in 35 
millimeter -- opens June 3 and surfers up and down the coast are, in a word, 
stoked. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time out, there's a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of surfing has changed dramatically since the Dana Point filmmaker 
and surfers Robert August of Seal Beach and Mike Hynson of San Diego packed up 
their boards in 1963 and left on the original around-the-world surfing safari. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the two "Endless Summer" films -- Brown spent $50,000 on the first 
one, which he shot on a 16-mm Bolex camera, while the $3.3-million sequel 
boasts a crew of eight -- underscore the evolution of surfing over the past 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County -- home to Surf City and the Wedge, Surfer and Surfing 
magazines, the Surfrider Foundation and the Assn. of Surfing Professionals -- 
has played a pivotal role in the sport's image and growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are definitely more aware of surfing than they were," said Brown, 56, 
who first rode the waves at Hermosa and Huntington as a kid in the '50s and 
began making surf films to bankroll his beach lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing has grown into a billion-dollar-a-year business that spawns everything 
from boards and wet suits to magazines and videos to the biggest offshoot of 
them all: the trend-setting surf-wear industry, whose ranks include such major 
Orange County-based labels as Off Shore, Billabong, Ocean Pacific Sunwear and 
Maui and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing has also become a global phenomenon, with burgeoning surf cultures in 
Brazil, Japan, France, Spain and England. And there are now resorts in Fiji and 
Indonesia catering to surfers, who are traveling more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, surfers can even make a living riding waves. About 50 surfers on a 
worldwide pro tour make $30,000 to $50,000 a year from contest winnings and 
endorsements, while 1992 world champ Kelly Slater and a small number of other 
upper-echelon surfers earn about half a million dollars. Says Peter Townend of 
Westminster, the first Assn. of Surfing Professionals world champ in 1976: "It 
wasn't that way in my time." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers have gained political muscle too. The decade-old Surfrider Foundation 
in San Clemente and other ecology-minded surfer organizations wage 
environmental legal battles and lobby on coastal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing is now not only offered in high schools up and down the Orange County 
coast, but teen-agers are just as likely to be paddling out with doctors, 
lawyers and CEOs who don wet suits to get in a few rides before dress-suiting 
up for work. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport even has enough of a history now that a handful of surf museums, 
from Huntington Beach to Santa Cruz to Florida, display the flotsam and jetsam 
of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the sport many once considered a realm of barefooted misfits 
has gained respect. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Before "Endless Summer" opened nationally in 1966 -- after debuting in school 
and civic auditoriums on the surf circuit two years earlier -- surfers had a 
generally unsavory reputation: They were the bad girls and boys of the beach, 
at least to the generation prone to wearing sandals and socks on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 New Journalism guru Tom Wolfe captured the generational contrast in "The Pump 
House Gang," his 1965 magazine story about the "too cool" surfer crowd that 
hung out at Windansea Beach in La Jolla: a tanned band of teen-agers who lived 
in garages, threw beer-keg parties and lived to surf. 
</P>
<P>
 The laid-back, party atmosphere still exists. But the good-humored "Endless 
Summer" shattered the stereotype. Brown went out of his way to show surfing as 
a bona fide sport requiring great skill, that surfers weren't aquatic versions 
of the Hells Angels and -- most memorably captured on film -- that riding waves 
was as much poetry as sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The antithesis of all those bland and cartoonish Frankie and Annette "Beach 
Party" movies, "Endless Summer" was the real thing, as much an engrossing 
travelogue as a compelling surf film. 
</P>
<P>
 "One area that Bruce had a big impact was he showed surfers that the world is 
not flat. There are waves everywhere," said Surfer magazine editor Steve Hawk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawk credits the beginning of the surfing boom in the '60s to several factors, 
including mass production of foam surfboards and advances in wet-suit 
technology that now allow surfing year-round -- even Alaska, which offers this 
advantage: "You can surf until midnight." 
</P>
<P>
 But playing no small role in the initial popularity of the sport were the 
"Gidget" movies, the Beach Boys' music and Brown's "Endless Summer." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real turning point in the general cultural image of the sport," Hawk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawk, who attended a preview of the sequel, said it not only has the "best 
cinematography" of any surf film he's ever seen, but "overall, in capturing 
contemporary surfing, I think it's the best surf movie ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so heartening when I saw (the sequel) to realize that the same kind of 
joyful spirit that permeated the first movie is alive and well in the second 
one. He really does a terrific job showing how fun it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But can "Endless Summer II" -- in which California surfers Robert (Wingnut) 
Weaver of Santa Cruz and Pat O'Connell of Laguna Niguel go on a two-year, 
seven-country search for perfect waves -- pack as big a wallop as the original, 
which turned even pasty-faced New York film critics on to the joys of surfing? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it'll have the same eye-opening impact because (the original) 
kind of changed the perception forever," said Hawk, adding that "back in those 
days surfers had limited visual access to the sport. There was no such thing as 
videos, and you had to go to your local junior high school and see some 
small-time 16-mm film." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, surfing competitions not only air regularly on cable channels, but the 
number of surf video titles has grown from a handful a few years ago to about 
20 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hottest surf-video makers is Taylor Steele of Solana Beach, who, at 
21, has become something of the Bruce Brown of the MTV generation. His 
punk-music-accompanied 40-minute videos feature the world's top short boarders 
"ripping" in the best small surf spots in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Print chroniclers of the sport are also flourishing. In addition to the 
venerable Surfer magazine, founded in 1960 by San Clemente surf filmmaker John 
Severson, and San Clemente-based Surfing, which celebrates its 30th anniversary 
this year -- regional tabloid newspaper-style "zines" such as H30 in Hawaii and 
Beach Happy in Huntington Beach zero in on the local scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, several of the newer publications are aimed at older surfers 
who ride long boards, such as Contemporary Longboarding, Longboarder and Long 
Board Quarterly. Surfer's Journal, a slick quarterly, also features pieces 
aimed at more "mature" readers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, said Hawk, "the graying of the surf population is one of the most 
significant changes of all." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the '60s when veteran wave riders were a rarity, many surfers who began 
riding waves 30 years ago have yet to retire their boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that means," said Hawk, "is that there are a lot of surfers out there 
who can go to a surf shop and buy a board and leash and put it on their 
American Express gold card, which wasn't really true in the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 It also means there are now multi-generational surf families such as Tom and 
Nancy Gudauskas of Capistrano Beach, who have taught their three sons -- 
8-year-old twins Dane and Patrick and 5-year-old Tanner -- to surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gudauskas, who recalls being so excited after seeing the original "Endless 
Summer" as a kid in Santa Monica that he couldn't sleep that night, said his 
sons have been watching the classic surf film twice a month since it came out 
on video a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He also plans to take his entire family to see "Endless Summer II" the day it 
opens, which happens to be his 41st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really what (the original film) did was open my eyes to a big world out 
there," said Gudauskas, who has since surfed in Tahiti, Fiji, Hawaii and 
Mexico. "Now I'm looking forward to this movie coming to light up my family and 
take them to all the surf spots featured in the movie." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a dimly lighted mixing room in a Burbank sound studio earlier this month, 
Brown sat watching the wide-screen image of Robert (Wingnut) Weaver rocketing 
down a wind-swept wall of green water. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not many surfers on the west coast of South Africa," Brown was 
saying on the sound track, a rhythmic guitar underscoring the wave action at 
Elands Bay. "This was the weekend: There were only about six people out. 
Wingnut was in surfer heaven. " 
</P>
<P>
 Casually dressed in tan Levi's and a blue long-sleeved T-shirt bearing a Clark 
Foam logo, Brown was in the middle of a weeklong dubbing session, his final 
task on "Endless Summer II." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown hasn't made a film since "On Any Sunday," his 1971 Academy 
Award-nominated motorcycle documentary. He said he turned down numerous offers 
over the years to do a sequel to "Endless Summer" but finally relented, in 
part, because he respected the film crew he would be working with and his 
33-year-old son, Dana, could help him write, shoot and edit the film. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the original "Endless Summer," Brown said during a smoke break outside 
the studio, "I think it showed surfing in a dignified way, that it was an 
honorable thing to do and all that. That was very important to me, to help give 
the sport a good image -- at the same time being entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 "Endless Summer II," he said, will offer more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is it's real positive," said Brown. "I mean, hey, it's a couple of 
young guys going off around the world, having a good time. There's no dark side 
to it. Everything's happy and things are bitchen because that's the way I look 
at things too." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not concerned that "some New York intellectual" may complain that he 
didn't show "the other side of it. You'll notice there's no surfers with 
tattoos and that kind of thing because that's the side of it that, to me, 
doesn't represent what I perceive to be the good part of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Still a Hollywood outsider by choice, Brown moved out of a bluff-top home in 
Dana Point in the early '80s when it became too crowded for his taste. He now 
lives on the coast north of Santa Barbara where he still regularly hits the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the changes, he doesn't believe the surf scene is much different 
today than it was in the original "Endless Summer." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think surfers deep down have probably changed at all -- the real 
surfers," he said. "It's a lot more crowded (in the water), so that's the main 
difference. But if you have a place to surf where there's not a bunch of 
people, to me, it's mostly still the same and I think most surfers share that: 
</P>
<P>
 "You're sitting out there in some neat spot on a good day and you're just 
going, 'Wow, man! Aren't we lucky?' "

O.C. DISTRICT SUES TO REMOVE CHILD FROM CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A 6-year-old kindergartner who allegedly bit teachers, threw a desk, hit and 
spit at students and sent a teacher and her aide out on medical leave was sued 
Wednesday by a Huntington Beach school district, apparently the first lawsuit 
of its kind in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit by the Ocean View Elementary School District asks the court to remove 
Jimmy Peters, who is described in the suit as handicapped and developmentally 
disabled, from regular classes at Circle View Elementary School. State law 
prohibits a school district from doing that without the permission of the 
child's parent or a court order, and Jimmy's parent has refused to give that 
permission, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Wenkart, a lawyer for the Orange County Department of Education, said 
the case is the first of its kind in the county, but probably won't be the 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting for this to happen," Wenkart said. "It's inevitable that 
this will happen given the way the law is written. . . . But it's going to 
happen more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 The law was established as a result of a landmark 1988 case in which the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that school administrators may not remove a student with 
special needs from regular classrooms without permission from a parent or 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy's behavior has caused chaos at the elementary school during the last six 
months, according to the lawsuit and a parent and teacher in the class. After 
months of complaining to the principal and school administrators about the 
situation, several parents resorted to pulling their children out of the 
kindergarten class on Thursday, the day after Jimmy bit a teacher, according to 
parent Janet Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said she and other parents planned to keep their children home until 
the end of the year unless Jimmy was removed, but that Principal Dan Moss 
persuaded them to return their children to school this week, promising to 
resolve the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a nightmare," Edwards said. "Basically, my son has missed out on 
kindergarten. There's nothing I can do about it. Our hands are tied." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit accuses Jimmy of "spitting at other students; hitting students, 
teachers, and staff members; pulling a chair from underneath a student; 
throwing over a heavy desk; and throwing temper tantrums wherein Jimmy had to 
be restrained by one or more adults." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 18, according to the suit, Jimmy bit Sandra Davila, his kindergarten 
teacher. The next day, Moss assigned two additional aides to the classroom, but 
"despite three adults exclusively devoted to assisting Jimmy, he hit, bit and 
kicked the staff members and was extremely disruptive," the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Davila and an instructional aide were both placed on medical leave "due to the 
stress of the classroom situation," according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted at her home Wednesday night, Davila said her doctor told her "not to 
talk about it because I get too stressful." 
</P>
<P>
 But Davila's husband, James, said his wife has been teaching in the school 
district for about three decades and confirmed that she was recently placed on 
medical leave because of "mental problems stemming from this child and (this) 
whole controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 "She has really been beat up a lot, she was physically hurt, and she's not in 
good shape at all," the husband said. "If she talks about it at all, she'll 
break down crying. . . . I have to protect her." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the lawsuit, James Davila said, "It's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said in their lawsuit that they have taken several steps to 
avoid legal action. Apart from assigning a full-time instructional aide to the 
boy, district officials hired two experts from the Orange County Department of 
Education and Cal State Long Beach to act as consultants on Jimmy's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jimmy appears "to be regressing in his emotional and educational 
development," the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 James Peters, identified in the lawsuit as the boy's parent, could not be 
reached for comment. According to the suit, he has refused to accept the 
experts' recommendation to put Jimmy in a special day class away from the other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Belkin, Orange County's director of special schools, said that while it 
is rare for a school district to sue a student, the growing push for full 
inclusion of disabled students over the past few years has left administrators 
with few options. 
</P>
<P>
 If parents don't agree to place their child in a special-education class, an 
impartial panel is assigned to review the case and decide whether the child 
belongs in regular education classes or special classes. The panel has the 
power to place the child in special classes. The Ocean View district is 
pursuing a court order to remove Jimmy until that panel has its hearing next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only option a district has under current special-education law," 
Belkin said. "When you have a student that poses a danger to self and others, 
if the parents don't agree, the child by law stays put. To go beyond that, the 
district has to use the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that common, but it's becoming more and more common as more students 
who have aggressive and assaultive behavior are being put into regular 
education programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have typically ruled to keep students in the least restrictive 
environment possible -- and that means regular classes, Belkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenkart, the department of education's lawyer, said local schools have so far 
avoided court battles on this issue because "we've always managed to be able to 
convince the parents to move the child."

HUBBLE CONFIRMS EXISTENCE OF HUGE BLACK HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY SAWYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hubble Space Telescope has confirmed for the first time the existence of a 
supermassive black hole, ending a decades-long quest for definitive proof, 
astronomers announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The orbiting observatory, with corrective lenses installed during a repair 
mission in December, was able to see clearly for the first time into the heart 
of the giant galaxy M87, more than 50 million light-years away in the 
constellation Virgo, where astronomers have long suspected that a monstrous 
black hole was lurking. 
</P>
<P>
 The telescope revealed the details so sharply that the observing team was able 
to "weigh" the object at the galaxy's center with unexpected ease, the 
astronomers said. The key was a pancake-shaped disc of hot gas spinning around, 
and being consumed, by something at the center. Measurements of its velocity 
showed that the central object has a mass 2 billion to 3 billion times the mass 
of the sun, compressed into an area about the size of our solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that isn't a black hole, I don't know what it is," said Holland Ford of 
Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute in 
Baltimore. He and Richard Harms of Applied Research Corp. in Landover, Md., led 
the observing team and announced the findings Wednesday at National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of a black hole was built, at first, purely on mathematical 
equations and imaginings of theorists. They envisioned a massive, collapsing 
object (a star or group of stars) whose gravitational pull is so powerful that 
nothing -- not even light -- can come out again after it has crossed the hole's 
threshold, known as the "event horizon." Within this singular object, normal 
time and space come to a halt. The known laws of physics do not apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The immense gravity of the black hole draws all nearby objects and material 
toward it, forming a whirlpool (called an "accretion disc") that resembles 
water going down a bathtub drain. In this maelstrom, matter crowds in, 
collides, heats up and forms what Hubble saw as a pancake of gas around the 
hole, with high-speed jets of gas spewing from the disc near one or both poles 
of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, increasingly sophisticated instruments gradually have piled 
up convincing evidence that these objects exist. But, Ford said, "skeptical 
colleagues were always clever enough to create computer models showing that 
some other explanation was possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, said Bruce Margon of the University of Washington, "we no longer have an 
alternative theory." 
</P>
<P>
 "All reasonable astronomers will be convinced" said NASA astronomer Stephen 
Maran of the Goddard Space Flight Center, who is also a spokesman for the 
American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The "smoking gun" proof presented Wednesday was the measurement of the 
astounding velocity in the whirling disc of gas as it was sucked inward by the 
powerful gravity of the hole: At a distance of 60 light-years from the center, 
it was whipping around at 1.2 million m.p.h. (A light-year is about 5.8 
trillion miles.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get that measurement, all you need is straightforward Newtonian 
physics to calculate the mass of the central object that's making the disc 
spin," Harms said. In a similar way, astronomers have measured the motion of 
the planets to determine the sun's mass. 
</P>
<P>
 M87 is a giant football-shaped collection of up to a trillion stars. It has 
fascinated astronomers since early in the century, when they detected a jet of 
hot ionized gas at least 4,000 light-years long shooting from its core. Such a 
jet is now thought to be one signature of a black hole. The new observations 
show that the disc of whirling gas is positioned at a right angle to the jet, 
just as predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Theorist Edwin E. Salpeter of Cornell University, after seeing the new Hubble 
data, said: "A black hole is now the least crazy model for what we're seeing." 
Thirty years ago, Salpeter and a Russian astronomer independently wrote papers 
essentially predicting Wednesday's findings. "It's good to finally win the 
bet," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent observations indicate that black holes may come in a variety of sizes 
and may lie at the cores of many galaxies, including Earth's home galaxy, the 
Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, recent observations indicate that these powerhouses may be 
commonplace in the universe, existing in all sizes and throughout time.

CLINTON EXPECTED TO RENEW CHINA'S TRADE PRIVILEGES; COMMERCE: A COMMISSION TO 
MONITOR THE NATION'S HUMAN RIGHTS IS REPORTEDLY PLANNED. LIMITED SANCTIONS ON 
CHINESE GUNS AND AMMUNITION ARE POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is expected to announce today that he will renew China's 
trade privileges, but he may impose extremely limited sanctions on Chinese-made 
guns and ammunition, according to sources who were briefed on the White House 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said Wednesday that the Clinton Administration also plans to set 
up a new commission to examine human rights abuses in China. The commission 
reportedly would be headed by former President Jimmy Carter, who established 
diplomatic relations with the Beijing regime in 1979 while he was in the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission would be designed as a replacement for the approach that 
Clinton proposed last year but will now abandon: using trade as leverage to 
improve human rights in China. In recent days, human rights groups have 
denounced the idea of a human rights commission for China as a meaningless 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have no authority, no clout and no teeth," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, 
Washington director of Human Rights Watch (Asia). 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is facing a deadline of June 3 to decide whether to renew 
China's most-favored-nation trade benefits, which permit Chinese goods to be 
sold in this country under the same low tariffs enjoyed by virtually all other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Clinton suggested that China should make "overall significant 
progress" on human rights if it wanted renewal of these benefits for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's decision to renew the trade benefits would stand unless both 
houses of Congress passed a resolution to revoke it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton prepared to announce his decision on future policy toward China, 
the White House struggled throughout Wednesday to win the critical support of 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), the principal architect of 
the policy of linking trade benefits to human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, the main question was not whether Clinton would renew 
China's overall trade benefits, since all sides have agreed for weeks that he 
would do so. Rather, the issue was whether he would impose sanctions on Chinese 
imports in response to rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials hope to avoid the embarrassment of a split with 
Mitchell, who has urged the White House to impose some significant sanctions on 
Chinese products. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House was considering limited economic sanctions on Chinese weapons, 
or no penalties at all. But Mitchell was pressing for broader, more significant 
penalties on all Chinese products made by the People's Liberation Army or by 
defense-related companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Mitchell the Senate majority leader, he has also done more than 
anyone to create the China issue that was used for years by congressional 
Democrats against former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after China's bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrations, he pressed for legislation attaching conditions to the renewal 
of China's trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Clinton embraced Mitchell's approach during the 1992 campaign, 
when he accused Bush of "coddling dictators" in Beijing and criticized Bush for 
vetoing legislation on the issue that Mitchell had sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after a year in the White House, Clinton is backing away from Mitchell's 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said he plans to drop the presidential executive 
order he issued last year attaching a series of human rights conditions to the 
renewal of China's most-favored trade status. 
</P>
<P>
 By imposing penalties exclusively on Chinese-made guns and ammunition, the 
Administration would, in effect, convert the China trade issue into a 
gun-control measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell has objected, saying that the penalties on Chinese-made guns and 
ammunition do not go far enough. China exports more than $31 billion in 
products to the United States, and the guns and ammunition make up only a tiny 
share of these sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been under intense pressure from the U.S. business 
community to renew China's trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. firms fear that if the benefits are revoked, China will retaliate against 
U.S. companies and deal instead only with their European and Asian competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive order that Clinton issued last year put the Administration into 
an awkward position. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials believed at the time that the human rights conditions they imposed 
were so reasonable and limited that China would be willing and able to meet 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1993 order, China was required to open the way for emigration of the 
families of some dissidents and to take action to curb the export of goods made 
with prison labor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, China was supposed to make "overall significant progress" on 
releasing dissidents from prison, on stopping the jamming of Voice of America 
broadcasts and on preserving Tibet's cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 China has repeatedly denounced imposition of these conditions and has said it 
will never be pressured into changing its domestic policies.

FAVORED SCIENTISTS GOT CIGARETTE FIRM FUNDING; RESEARCH: SUPPOSEDLY INDEPENDENT 
COUNCIL STEERED GRANTS TO STUDIES THAT MIGHT AID INDUSTRY, DOCUMENTS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cigarette company lawyers for years ran a "special projects" division within 
the putatively independent Council for Tobacco Research, steering grants to 
favored scientists whose research might be used to defend the industry from 
legal attack, internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents from the files of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. show that top 
lawyers from the major cigarette firms during the 1970s and '80s made "special 
project" grants to scores of scientists and research organizations, bypassing a 
scientific advisory board of outside experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry research effort has included special projects designed to find 
scientists and medical doctors who might serve as industry witnesses in 
lawsuits or in a legislative forum," said B&W general counsel Ernest Pepples in 
a 1978 memo to then-company Chairman Joseph E. Eden. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry officials long have asserted the council's independence from 
business and legal concerns, saying its grants are based on scientific merit 
alone. The claim has been central to the defense of smoker-death cases, in 
which industry lawyers have cited lavish support for the council as proof of an 
honest quest for knowledge about the effects of tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Pepples nor officials of the Council for Tobacco Research, based in 
New York, could be reached for comment. However, Tom Fitzgerald, a spokesman 
for Brown & Williamson, said: "We believe the Council for Tobacco Research 
operates with integrity and funds meritorious research by independent 
scientists who are then encouraged to publish it." 
</P>
<P>
 Council materials are among reams of B&W documents recently provided to 
congressional tobacco foes Reps. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), and to several news organizations, including The Times. B&W -- the 
No. 3 U.S. cigarette firm, which markets Barclay, Kool and other brands -- says 
the documents were stolen by a former paralegal for a law firm that represents 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will be the focus of a hearing today before Waxman's House 
subcommittee on health and environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally called the Tobacco Industry Research Council, the CTR was the 
industry's response to early studies linking smoking and lung cancer -- a 
linkage so unspeakable for tobacco executives that B&W's parent, 
British-American Tobacco, for a time used the code word "ZEPHYR" to describe 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was launched in 1954 with ads in 448 U.S. newspapers. Under the 
heading, "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers," the tobacco firms 
proclaimed: "We accept an interest in people's health as a basic 
responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the announcement, the research council would get at the truth of 
the health allegations by investigating "all phases of tobacco use and health." 
An advisory panel of experts "disinterested in the cigarette industry" would 
screen research proposals for scientific merit. In the years since, the body 
has provided more than $223 million in research grants, according to the 
council's 1993 annual report. 
</P>
<P>
 The new disclosures are not the first to raise questions about the council. 
Tobacco foes in the past have denounced it as a public relations ploy meant to 
promote the fiction of a continuing debate on the health effects of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 In a candid 1974 memo introduced in a trial over the death several years ago 
of a New Jersey smoker, the research director of Lorillard Inc. acknowledged: 
"Historically, the joint industry-funded smoking and health research programs 
have been selected . . . for various purposes, such as public relations, 
political relations, position for litigation etc." 
</P>
<P>
 But the newly leaked papers provide the most detailed information yet on the 
council's role in industry legal strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents include dozens of letters from attorneys with two big industry 
law firms -- Shook, Hardy & Bacon in Kansas City, Mo.; and Jacob, Medinger & 
Finnegan in New York -- seeking approval of CTR "special project" grants for 
various researchers. The letters were sent to Pepples and top lawyers for the 
other big cigarette firms. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some of the "special project" grants went to researchers studying 
alternative explanations for high rates of heart disease and lung cancer among 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Shook, Hardy, and Jacob, Medinger declined to discuss details of 
the special project grants, although Shook, Hardy attorney Gary Long said the 
research was not secret and grantees were allowed to publish their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents show that at least one researcher rejected for regular funding 
from the council turned to the lawyers instead. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the papers, after Louisiana State University researcher Dr. Henry 
Rothschild was turned down in 1981, industry lawyers granted CTR special 
project funding for his research on genetic and environmental factors in lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothschild later testified for the industry before Congress, according to the 
documents, which include a 1978 journal article, co-authored by Rothschild, 
that criticized as dubious such advice from doctors as "the complete 
elimination of cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there were any restrictions placed on what we found," 
Rothschild said in a telephone interview Wednesday when asked about his special 
project funding. "There was no quid pro quo." 
</P>
<P>
 A perennial recipient of special project funds was Carl C. Seltzer, formerly 
of the Harvard University School of Public Health. The documents include four 
newspaper clippings and four television news transcripts chronicling a trip to 
Australia in May, 1979, in which Seltzer's view that smoking does not cause 
heart disease was widely quoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reports from colleagues in Australia and New Zealand indicate that Dr. 
Seltzer's visit 'was a great success,' " said a Shook, Hardy lawyer in a letter 
to Pepples. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CTR supported all kinds of research," including research "contrary to the 
interests of the tobacco companies," Seltzer, now semi-retired, said in a 
telephone interview Wednesday. "I think that's a very important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Other documents include a position paper by foes of California's Proposition 
10, a smoking control initiative defeated by voters in November, 1980. The 
paper, issued by a group called Californians Against Regulatory Excess, quoted 
several recipients of special project funds as debunking the problems of 
secondhand smoke -- but did not disclose their industry ties. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents also reflect the council's legal significance to the industry as 
it braced for a surge in claims that tobacco caused smokers' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978 memos to top B&W executives, Pepples explained how CTR solved a huge 
legal quandary involving the industry's need to both fund research and be able 
to dismiss adverse findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The CTR "avoids the research dilemma presented to a responsible manufacturer 
of cigarettes, which on the one hand needs to know the state of the art and on 
the other hand cannot afford the risk of having in-house work turn sour," 
Pepples wrote on Sept. 29, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point here," he wrote, "is the value of having CTR doing work in a 
non-directed and independent fashion as contrasted with work either in-house or 
under B&W contract which, if it goes wrong, can become the smoking pistol in a 
lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 On at least one occasion, however, Pepples voiced alarm that the council had 
funded sensitive "red light" projects without the companies' knowledge. These 
were biological tests related to cancer causation, including an effort to 
produce tumors in mice by injecting them with condensate from tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I confess that I was somewhat jarred by the revelation to me about tests on 
mice through the CTR," Pepples said in a March 10, 1977, memo to another B&W 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack Roemer (a top R.J. Reynolds lawyer) also finds that incongruous. He has 
checked with Ed Jacob (of the Jacob, Medinger law firm). . . . Ed was unaware 
of the fact of tests on mice," Pepples wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pursuing the thought just a bit further, these tests are so-called red light 
tests," Pepples wrote. "No matter what our explanation happened to be, the fact 
of the red light in our own hands would be a serious burden to the tobacco 
industry if it came out in legislative hearings or in litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco foes said the disclosures debunk industry claims about the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing situation, because to have a group of lawyers basically 
selecting scientific research . . . completely goes against the normal process 
by which scientific investigations are conducted," said Stanton Glantz, a 
University of California at San Francisco medical professor and longtime 
industry critic. The documents, he said, "really reveal that the CTR as it was 
presented to the public was just a sham."

COLUMN ONE; SCIENCE STOKES THE TOBACCO DEBATE; RESEARCH ON RISKS OF SECONDHAND 
EXPOSURE HAS FUELED AN ANTI-SMOKING REVOLUTION. CIGARETTE MAKERS ARE FIGHTING 
FIRE WITH FIRE, PRODUCING REPORTS THAT DISCOUNT THE DANGERS.

<P>
 He wanted his wife to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a simple wish, yet its consequences were profound. This was in the 
1970s, in Greece, where smoking was as cherished a pastime as baseball in 
America. Dimitrios Trichopoulos didn't care about bucking the tide. He simply 
detested his wife's addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 A young cancer epidemiologist at the University of Athens, Trichopoulos tried 
the usual guilt trip. He told her she was hurting herself. On this, he said, 
the medical literature was clear. When that didn't work, he told her she was 
hurting him -- an argument he could not support with statistics. She didn't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the scientist, he set out to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 That family argument wound up earning Trichopoulos a place in tobacco history. 
He was the first researcher to connect secondhand cigarette smoke with an 
increased risk of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 He accomplished this in a somewhat unorthodox fashion, pirating $50,000 from 
one of his grants to conduct a survey of 189 nonsmoking women. (Greek 
officials, Trichopoulos says, would never have given him money to study the 
detrimental effects of a cash crop as lucrative as tobacco). He found that 
smokers' wives were twice as likely to develop lung cancer as women married to 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. "I convinced her," Trichopoulos says. His wife quit. 
</P>
<P>
 The study did much more than clean the air in the Trichopoulos home. He 
published it in 1981, days before the publication of a larger study conducted 
by Japanese epidemiologist Takeshi Hirayama. These papers gave a huge boost to 
a grass-roots anti-smoking campaign that has dramatically changed the way 
Americans work, dine, travel and raise children. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the nature of the secondhand smoke revolution: a little bit of science 
-- still emerging, not all of it conclusive -- shaping a lot of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 For anti-smoking activists, scientific research into the dangers of secondhand 
smoke has been a godsend. The high point came last year, when the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency declared secondhand smoke a "Group A" human 
carcinogen, reporting that it accounts for 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year. 
This placed it in the same deadly category as asbestos and radon; the agency 
concluded that the danger cannot be eliminated by using smoking and nonsmoking 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in large part to that report, secondhand smoke is now one of the 
nation's most pressing and divisive public health issues. Coupled with 
allegations that tobacco companies have misrepresented the nicotine content in 
cigarettes -- and tobacco executives' denials -- the issue is bringing public 
outrage to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tobacco industry is fighting back -- hard. A coalition of farmers and 
manufacturers filed a lawsuit alleging that the EPA "manipulated and 
cherry-picked scientific data" and asked that a U.S. District Court judge in 
North Carolina nullify the report. In California, tobacco giant Philip Morris 
has placed a controversial initiative on the November ballot that would undo 
local ordinances designed to curb secondhand smoke and replace them with a 
looser standard. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday, cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds launched an aggressive public 
information campaign designed to stave off smoking bans by countering the 
widespread perception that secondhand smoke is dangerous. The company's tactic: 
Fight science with science. 
</P>
<P>
 In full-page newspaper ads, R.J. Reynolds says its research shows that 
nonsmokers are exposed to "very little" secondhand smoke, even when they live 
or work with smokers. In one month, the company said, a nonsmoker living with a 
smoker would breathe the equivalent of smoking 1 1/2 cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Policies should be based on science," Chris Coggins, the R.J. Reynolds 
toxicologist, said in an interview Wednesday. "I think that the (EPA) science 
is very, very weak." 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry has a long way to go toward rolling back public policy on 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 state and local ordinances restrict smoking in public places, 
including Los Angeles' hotly debated restaurant ban. Across the United States, 
in cities large and small, a familiar sight has emerged: Smokers congregating 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration is contemplating a 
ban in all workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, a congressional subcommittee approved a bill, introduced by Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), that would ban smoking in most buildings, 
except restaurants and private clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no smoking on domestic flights. There is no smoking in the White 
House; First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will not tolerate it. There is no 
smoking with your Big Mac; McDonald's recently banned tobacco in its 
corporate-owned restaurants. Taco Bell and Jack in the Box followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Nevada prisoner who 
called his cellmate's smoke cruel and unusual punishment. Custody battles have 
been settled by giving preference to parents who do not smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnabout from a smoking to a smoke-free society seems to have occurred 
overnight. It could not have happened, anti-smoking advocates say, without 
science. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago, I tried to have one room in a cruise ship declared 
smoke-free and I was told I was crazy," said John Banzhaf, a law professor at 
George Washington University who runs Action on Smoking and Health, or ASH. 
"Who at that time would have figured that 30% of all our businesses would be 
smoke-free today? . . . Things are moving amazingly quickly, and it is the 
scientific, medical underpinning that has changed the complexion of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, several hundred scientific studies link secondhand smoke to a variety 
of diseases: lung and other cancers, heart disease, respiratory infections 
including bronchitis and pneumonia, asthma and sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS), which claims the lives of babies as they sleep. This research is 
responsible for an oft-quoted statistic: About 53,000 Americans die each year 
from secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is so clear," says Mark Pertschuk, co-director of Americans for 
Non-Smokers Rights. "Everybody and his brother is lining up to ban smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the evidence, while compelling, is not as complete as Pertschuk suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Of each year's secondhand-smoke deaths, 3,000 are attributed to lung cancer, 
12,000 to other cancers and 37,000 to heart disease, according to the Coalition 
on Smoking OR Health, a nonprofit group formed by the American Lung Assn., the 
American Heart Assn. and the American Cancer Society. The coalition also 
estimates that secondhand smoke accounts for 700 SIDS deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scientists working outside the tobacco industry say the link between lung 
cancer and secondhand smoke is firmly established. But the evidence on heart 
disease -- which accounts for nearly 70% of estimated deaths -- is much newer, 
and not all scientists accept it. Only 14 studies have documented this link, 
and the federal government has not yet taken a position. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, public tolerance for secondhand smoke is waning. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Gallup Poll showed 38% of Americans support a ban on smoking in 
restaurants -- up 10% from three years ago. Support for workplace smoking bans 
is at 32%, up eight points from 1991. The poll also found 36% of Americans 
believe secondhand smoke is very harmful to adults, and 42% believe it is 
somewhat harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tide has turned," says Michael Eriksen, director of the Office on Smoking 
and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "I think an 
invisible line was crossed in terms of how the public feels about smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry is trying its best to persuade people to cross back over 
that line. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the research on secondhand smoke is epidemiological, 
meaning it traces patterns of disease and finds connections, rather than 
proving cause and effect. Based on those studies, scientists are just beginning 
to conduct animal research to learn the precise biological effects of 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry officials vehemently dispute the epidemiology, including the 
EPA report. They say some study subjects give inaccurate information about how 
much smoke they have been exposed to, or whether they have ever smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds officials also cite a recent report by the Congressional 
Research Service -- the research branch of the Library of Congress -- that 
characterized the EPA's data as "uncertain." Coggins, the Reynolds 
toxicologist, complains that the EPA failed to include recent data that found 
no link between lung cancer and secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The epidemiological evidence is not sufficient to say that (secondhand smoke) 
poses a health risk," says Gio Batta Gori, a toxicologist and consultant for 
the Tobacco Institute, a trade industry group. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA says nonsmokers face a 19% increase in their risk of developing lung 
cancer when they are exposed to secondhand smoke -- a figure Gori describes as 
"a whiff of a risk." He says that if 2.5% of the study subjects misclassified 
themselves, the research would be invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the EPA, which estimates that 1% of subjects misclassified themselves, 
sticks by its findings. EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner calls the agency's 
science "extensively documented" and said the R.J. Reynolds ads "will not 
distract the public from the real issue: that secondhand smoke poses a serious 
health problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Most independent scientists agree that secondhand smoke causes death and 
disease in healthy nonsmokers. It is particularly harmful to people who have 
underlying illnesses -- asthma, heart disease, bronchitis and other respiratory 
conditions -- that are exacerbated by cigarette fumes. But questions remain 
about just how much exposure will make a healthy person sick. 
</P>
<P>
 While living with or working near a heavy smoker is a serious health risk, the 
dangers of casual exposure are less clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were a patron and you go out to eat, say, once a week, I think the 
disease risk may, in fact, be negligible," says Don Shopland, coordinator for 
the National Cancer Institute's Smoking and Tobacco Control program. "On the 
other hand, if you are a waitress and have to work in that environment eight 
hours a day for several years, you have a very substantial disease burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Shopland says there is more than enough evidence to warrant smoking 
bans. He cites statistics showing that secondhand smoke-related lung cancer 
alone would kill 100 times as many people each year as asbestos. "And yet," he 
says, "if you find asbestos in a school, they will close the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- including Trichopoulos -- say the risks of secondhand smoke are not 
commensurate with the public outcry. The real health danger, they say, is to 
the smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 A smoker is 20 times more likely than a nonsmoker to develop lung cancer -- a 
2,000% higher risk. But, depending on the study cited, someone who breathes 
secondhand smoke is 1.19 times to 1.4 times as likely as a nonsmoker to develop 
lung cancer -- a 19% to 40% higher risk. 
</P>
<P>
 There is yet another ironic twist to the way science has shaped public policy: 
Most laws designed to curb exposure are directed at places where adults 
congregate -- restaurants and offices. But research shows the biggest danger is 
to children, particularly those whose parents smoke at home. They need the most 
protection, yet get the least. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the CDC, secondhand smoke causes up to 300,000 cases of 
bronchitis and pneumonia each year in children under 18 months. It can trigger 
or worsen asthma attacks, and may also be responsible for up to 26,000 new 
cases of childhood asthma each year. The agency estimates that 9 million 
youngsters under 5 live in homes with smokers and are exposed to secondhand 
smoke almost all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies show sudden infant death syndrome is 2 1/2 times more likely to 
strike babies whose mothers smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 These figures have been used in education campaigns, including one by the CDC 
and another in California financed by Proposition 99, the anti-smoking 
initiative adopted in 1988. Studies show the campaigns are working; people are 
smoking less, and are more cautious about where they smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 27% of California smokers reported they did not smoke in their 
homes -- up from 18.8% in 1992, according to Stanton Glantz, a UC San Francisco 
researcher who has done extensive work on secondhand smoke. Among smokers who 
lived with small children, 45% said they did not smoke at home. 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter what the research shows, a few simple truths remain: The vast 
majority of American adults -- 76% -- are not smokers. Many are annoyed by 
secondhand smoke. It might not make them seriously ill, but it makes their 
clothes smell and their eyes water. And they are no longer afraid to demand 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the scientists who produced what law professor Banzhaf calls the "medical 
underpinning" of all this social policy, the current debate is another rung on 
the tall ladder of acceptance. Many, like Trichopoulos, had little funding and 
even less support from mainstream health groups, such as the American Cancer 
Society and the American Heart Assn., which call secondhand smoke a major 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no researcher has struggled longer or harder than James Repace. He is 
a 55-year-old health physicist who, while working for the Naval Research 
Laboratory in Washington in the late 1970s, stumbled upon the idea that 
secondhand smoke could be measured as air pollution. Working nights and 
weekends, with a borrowed air-quality monitor, he took measurements at bars, 
bowling alleys and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 What he found surprised him: About 85% of indoor air pollution comes from 
tobacco. In Repace's view, that makes secondhand smoke the biggest pollution 
problem in America -- bigger, he says, than outdoor air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The typical levels of particles in the air in the presence of smoking," he 
says, "were worse than you would find on a busy commuter highway during rush 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
 On a lark, he sent his findings to the prestigious journal Science. The study 
was published in 1980. R.J. Reynolds researcher Coggins says Repace's work 
relied on outdated technology. But the Science article helped make Repace one 
of the nation's leading authorities on secondhand smoke; the media often quote 
him and the government often uses him as an expert witness. 
</P>
<P>
 His success, however, has not been a boon to his EPA career. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Repace was investigated for conflict of interest by the EPA inspector 
general after a Tennessee congressman complained that such outside activities 
prevented him from making a fair judgment about the dangers of tobacco smoke. 
Although he was cleared, he has been forced to leave the EPA. His bosses there, 
he said, have told him he is a lightning rod for complaints from the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a conclusion that he does not dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 He had little to do with the landmark report declaring secondhand smoke a 
human carcinogen, and is "on loan" to OSHA. "At the moment," he says, "I'm 
looking for other things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Trichopoulos' career, meanwhile, has not suffered. Today, he chairs the 
epidemiology department at the Harvard School of Public Health, marking him as 
one of the most respected researchers in his field. It has been a long journey 
from Greece in 1980, when he says, he could barely get his secondhand smoke 
findings published. 
</P>
<P>
 The study finally appeared in the International Journal of Cancer. 
Trichopoulos believes that had Hirayama's study not appeared soon after in the 
widely read British Medical Journal, neither would have been taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Harvard office, Trichopoulos keeps a rejection letter he got from the 
editors of one prestigious academic journal. The letter foreshadows the 
political touchiness of the secondhand smoke debate. The scientist chuckles 
each time he reads it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implications of your findings are enormous," the editors wrote. "We 
believe you will be proved right. . . . You will probably tell us once again 
that we are chicken." Fighting Science With Science 
</P>
<P>
 These dueling advertisements -- by the tobacco industry, above, and the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, right -- typify the public 
relations war over the health dangers of secondhand smoke.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SCORECARD ON THE DEBATES: BROWN WON BY NOT LOSING; POLITICS: 
BOTH SHE AND GARAMENDI AT TIMES SEEMED STIFF OR STAGY. OUTSIDER HAYDEN SHONE AS 
THE CONCILIATOR. 
</P>

<P>
 The consensus of political insiders Wednesday was that Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown won by not losing, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi lost by not 
winning and state Sen. Tom Hayden won by having little to lose and by being, 
well, Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Another winner in this week's Democratic gubernatorial debate-a-thon was an 
onlooker, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. The debates gave Wilson a pretty good 
idea of the sort of challenge he will face from the Democratic nominee -- and 
debate opponent -- this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But did the debates change the dynamics of the Democratic primary on June 7? 
Probably not, said Mervin Field, founding director of the Field Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were lively exchanges on a wide range of issues -- nearly 20 
sharply phrased questions asked on Tuesday night, plus rebuttals. Given the 
format restrictions imposed by the campaigns, these debates were as good as 
they could be. 
</P>
<P>
 For five hours of television and radio time over three consecutive days, 
Californians got a pretty good idea of what the Democratic contest for governor 
is all about: 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown, the front-runner, came across as cool, self-confident and, to many, 
capable. But her vague, stiff answers -- often couched in technocratic lingo 
such as "bond-out plan" -- did not contain much detail about what she would do 
as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The one time she did not come across as "canned," a reporter told Brown in a 
post-debate news conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, was when she finally 
got mad about attacks from Garamendi and lashed back. Brown said it "seemed 
like the right time" to retaliate but did not bother to refute the observation 
that she otherwise seemed canned. 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts agreed that Brown had to make a serious mistake, or fail to 
appear gubernatorial, for Garamendi to score a victory. That did not happen. In 
the wake of the debates, however, she remains an enigma because of her refusal 
to explain her personal opposition to the death penalty. The Wilson camp is 
sure to exploit that issue in the fall if Brown is the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garamendi, who has trailed Brown in opinion polls all year, was hot, 
aggressive and hyperbolic, all of which are characteristic of him at times. But 
some observers thought his attacks on Brown's record and ethics in office 
seemed too staged and that he came across as something of a bully. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Garamendi missed the opportunity to show the more positive 
side of his political persona, that of a former legislator and state 
administrator with a record of taking tough stands and developing serious 
public policy positions -- if not always popular ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Garamendi did not use the first two televised sessions to talk 
about his experiences working with Californians throughout the state. Garamendi 
used that tactic successfully in campaign speeches, but they were heard by a 
handful of people compared with the broadcast audiences of the debates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hayden entered the contest late and with limited goals, primarily to promote 
his crusade for reform of the political process by ridding it of the influence 
of special-interest contributions. He often bemoaned the fact that he was typed 
by two labels: 1960s radical student leader and former husband of Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day Wednesday, Hayden had achieved more than he could have 
imagined three months ago. First, he was treated as an equal of Brown and 
Garamendi. With his dry wit and relaxed manner, the 54-year-old Hayden emerged 
as something of an elder statesman of the Democratic Party in California, an 
avuncular conciliator and the candidate who actually seemed to have a coherent 
vision about what he wanted to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most quoted line from the San Francisco debate Tuesday night, the 
one that was seen on television in the major California population centers, 
came from Hayden. With Hayden standing between them, Brown and Garamendi 
exchanged sharp attacks on each other's allegedly unethical fund-raising 
tactics. When it was Hayden's turn to talk, he said: "John and Kathleen should 
not attack each other. These are good people in a bad system. The system has to 
be changed." 
</P>
<P>
 In his news conference later, Hayden quipped: "I felt like I was in the middle 
of an intense electromagnetic field. . . . That was wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Hayden managed to gently goad Brown and Garamendi into supporting 
some of his campaign reform proposals and to discuss how they would deal with 
the state budget deficit, a subject both had largely avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilson watched a videotape of the first debate and saw part of the second 
one on live television. Campaign manager George Gorton predicted that Brown 
would find a debate with the governor far more challenging. When Brown, for 
instance, mentioned casually Tuesday that she would raise taxes by closing tax 
loopholes, no one asked her to specify which loopholes. Gorton said Wilson 
mentioned Brown's new position when he called to chat about the debate before 
boarding a plane for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor is not going to let her get away with that stuff," Gorton said. 
"He's not going to allow it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has acquitted himself well in past debates, most political observers 
agree. In 1982, the conventional wisdom was that the articulate, quick-thinking 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. would whip the dull, plodding Wilson, then the 
mayor of San Diego, when they squared off in their campaigns for the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson got generally good reviews and scored a coup when he quickly 
answered Brown's obscure question about a United Nations resolution concerning 
the African nation of Namibia. Brown's gambit -- to show that Wilson was a 
small-time mayor not ready for the big-time issues facing the U.S. Senate -- 
backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, when he ran for governor, Wilson stole the headlines in a 
debate with Dianne Feinstein by endorsing Proposition 140, the measure that 
slapped term limits on legislators and statewide officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for impact in this week's debates was limited when the Brown 
campaign insisted that the first debate Monday night be televised only in the 
Sacramento area. Brown aides argued that she wanted to regionalize issues in 
each debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brown did not discuss any issue of a regional nature in the debates. 
Critics claimed that Brown really wanted to minimize exposure given to her 
opponents and to limit any political damage caused by a possible blunder. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no big blunders. But there are some lingering questions about 
Brown's performances, such as her failure to respond directly to many questions 
and to appear pious at times. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown told reporters she would continue to rebuff questions about the 
death penalty, she said, "I do not intend to change personal views that I have 
just to get elected governor. Other politicians have. Other politicians 
undoubtedly will in the future. But I am not going to." 
</P>
<P>
 No one had asked her to change her views, just explain them.

REFORMS IGNITED BY DEADLY FIRE STILL NOT IMPLEMENTED; SAFETY: CITY FIRE 
OFFICIALS BLAME BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND BUREAUCRACY. THE PICO/WESTLAKE BLAZE 
KILLED 10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after an arson blaze killed 10 people in an apartment building near 
Downtown Los Angeles, the major reforms proposed to help avert similar 
tragedies have not been implemented -- and serious fire safety violations 
persist in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for new fees, a fire inspection task force and a computerized 
record-keeping system have been stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Even relatively inexpensive equipment, such as fax machines and cameras that 
could help document fire code violatons, has not been purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 There were widespread calls for fire safety improvements after the May 3, 
1993, fire at 330 S. Burlington Ave., one of the deadliest fires in Los Angeles 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 But fire officials say budget constraints and the city bureaucracy have 
thwarted their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that if the dollars aren't there, it can't be done," said 
Battalion Chief Roger Gillis. "The frustration is there." 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire, The Times reported that almost two-thirds of the apartment 
buildings in the densely populated Pico-Union/Westlake area had not received 
required annual inspections and that many had serious fire safety violations, 
such as missing fire extinguishers and padlocked emergency exits. 
</P>
<P>
 Two city audits later confirmed the widespread violations and found that 
shoddy record-keeping, understaffing and other problems had contributed to the 
dangerous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before City Council members after the blaze, city Fire Chief Donald 
O. Manning proposed a series of reforms, including creation of a special 
25-member task force that would sweep through 1,200 apartment complexes in 
Pico/Westlake and other densely populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In an internal audit released in October, the Fire Department also proposed a 
$1.8-million computerized fire prevention system that would replace handwritten 
inspection cards and help ensure code compliance by apartment owners. Under the 
current system, fire officials did not have a file card with the fire safety 
history of the Burlington building until after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But fire officials said these two key proposals have been put on hold due to 
budgetary constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude, chairman of the public safety committee, said all 
city departments must live within their budgets in difficult economic times. 
"If this is . . . the department's highest priority, it should be done," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan, Noelia Rodriguez, said the Fire 
Department received all the money it asked for in the current budget. She said 
the City Council committees reviewing the audits of the Fire Department have 
not yet requested additional monies for proposed reforms either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen anything to act on from the council committees," she said. 
"The Fire Department is getting what they asked for. It's not like the mayor 
isn't giving them the resources." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department has asked the City Council for the authority to charge 
building owners $170 fees for follow-up inspections of violations. Officials 
also renewed their efforts to get an ordinance requiring owners of many older 
apartment buildings to require sprinklers in hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 But fire officials said these two proposals are stuck in City Council 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mundane problems also have hindered implementation of proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The department lacks $30,000 to purchase file cabinets for new larger-format 
inspection logs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And an employee grievance has delayed a pilot program for two months that 
would allow two firefighters to handle follow-up inspections in Pico/Westlake 
and another busy fire district. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hazardous fire safety conditions remain commonplace in 
Pico/Westlake buildings, although some of the residential hotels built in the 
1920s and 1930s have shown improvement since last year, according to interviews 
and visits by reporters to more than two dozen buildings this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inner city is becoming a death trap due to lack of attention and 
resources to deal with these issues," said City Councilman Mike Hernandez, 
whose district includes Pico/Westlake. "It's always been the case that the 
inner city has been shortchanged." 
</P>
<P>
 At the El Vista Apartments at 630 S. Alvarado St., some of the hallway doors 
designed to close in a fire to prevent the spread of smoke and flames were 
broken or propped open last week, and one fire hose was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire extinguishers had been replaced, but the fire escape door to the El 
Vista's roof was padlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 The building manager said he reported the missing fire hose to owner 
Nejatollah Bakhshian three weeks ago. Bakhshian told The Times that he would 
replace it and blamed the problems on intruders and irresponsible tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Francisco Mendez said that fire inspectors made him unlock the roof 
exit during an April 1 inspection, but that he relocked it to keep homeless 
people from sleeping on the roof and lighting fires to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to protect the security of the families," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hotel Barbizon, a brick-faced residential hotel, fire doors were 
propped open on every floor last week, and fire hose cabinets were nailed shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owner Joan Chen said she was unaware of the fire safety conditions, 
but would have her maintenance people do the necessary repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other owners, she said that maintaining fire safety conditions was an 
ongoing battle and blamed tenants for propping open fire doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We check it every week," Chen said. "Tenants stick things in the doors." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby Bruce Arms had missing fire hoses and broken fire doors despite 
several inspections by the Fire Department, the building manager said. Other 
buildings had similar violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire hazards are still here," said Enrique Velazquez, director of 
Inquilinos Unidos, an advocacy group for the mostly immigrant tenants of 
Pico/Westlake. "The problem is that the city is not doing much about them. . . 
. It is a nightmare, I tell you, to live in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Burlington fire, the Fire Department inspected thousands of similar 
buildings across the city. Battalion Chief Gillis said inspectors issued 
numerous citations and referred 654 cases to city attorneys for possible legal 
action against apartment owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, at least 438 of the cases have been resolved, usually when the 
owner complied with fire codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said the department has tried to streamline the inspection system and 
is providing additional fire prevention training for firefighters. In addition, 
he said, fire inspections are being given a high priority, although emergency 
response remains the highest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said firefighters conducting inspections in busy areas no longer will 
be interrupted for tasks such as cleanup of fuel spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that by speeding the (inspection) system up, making it more 
user-friendly and reducing the workload on firefighters, that we'll get into 
more buildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gillis added, budget pressures may prevent the department from 
increasing inspections. Already, the number of surprise night inspections for 
each apartment building has been reduced from three a year to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Fire Department budget was $249.6 million, and the proposed budget 
for the next fiscal year is $253.1 million. Officials said their staffing 
levels have dropped 18% since 1978 while the workload has doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials blame others for many of the fire safety problems: 
</P>
<P>
 Some landlords do not properly maintain their buildings, even after being 
taken to court. Some apartment managers padlock doors to keep out the homeless 
and gang members. And some residents deactivate fire alarms when frying food, 
and some steal the fire extinguishers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said an important part of building safety rests with the 
managers who must make sure that fire doors are working well enough to stop a 
fire and deadly smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Burlington fire, smoke raced through the building with such speed that 
residents died in the hallways while trying to escape. Investigators later 
found that fire doors had been propped open. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other buildings are vulnerable to the sort of fire that races down a 
central hallway through open fire doors, said Robert Barton, a Building and 
Safety Department senior inspector who sits on the city's multi-agency slum 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fire will have nothing to stop it, and there will be nothing there that 
the tenants can use to stop the fire," Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help avert similar fires, the Fire Department is seeking an ordinance that 
would force apartment building owners to install sprinklers in hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hundreds of locations, they literally cannot keep the extinguishers in 
there," Chief Manning told the Fire Commission last week. "They are stolen, 
often immediately after they are installed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Manning said owners have refused to pay for the costly sprinklers, even 
after fire officials offered to waive a requirement for portable fire 
extinguishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very, very adamant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems, including some identified in the audits, have gone 
unaddressed. 
</P>
<P>
 More bilingual inspectors are needed to improve communication with residents, 
to find out their concerns and problems and warn them of the need to obey fire 
safety laws, according to an audit conducted last year by the city's chief 
administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of non-English-speaking tenants and managers make the 
dissemination of Fire Code procedures and regulations extremely difficult," 
said the CAO audit. "It was brought to our attention that brochures explaining 
(fire safety code) requirements in languages other than English might well 
prove the difference between life and death should a fire or other fire safety 
incident arise." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many of the buildings visited by reporters last week lacked even the most 
rudimentary fire safety signs. Although the buildings house many Latino 
immigrants, only a few had signs in English and Spanish explaining escape 
routes and the need to keep fire doors open. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposed reforms also have gone by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Building and Safety Department inspectors often come across fire 
safety violations, but they are limited to a reactive role. For example, they 
can only go out on a fire inspection in response to a complaint. Then they are 
only allowed to inspect the one apartment unit with a reported problem -- not 
the entire building. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the reform measures have been too little, and too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hernandez blamed city officials for not adequately funding the Fire 
Department. Hernandez said the reforms have taken a back seat to other 
priorities caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Velazquez, the tenant advocate: "When the issue is hot, everyone is 
interested and wants to do something. Once the issue cools down, no one pays 
attention. The problems are still there. And the situation is getting worse and 
worse."

HOUSE PONDERS ROSTENKOWSKI'S FATE IN WHISPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An uncommon code of silence enveloped the House on Wednesday as it confronted 
the strong possibility that Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) will step down as 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful lawmaker, an unparalleled master of arm-twisting and 
deal-cutting, is considered crucial to the fate of health care reform, as well 
as the Democrats' overall legislative record. 
</P>
<P>
 In corridors and cloakrooms on the House side of the Capitol, lawmakers 
wondered and worried about who would succeed him -- and the implications the 
succession would have both for them and for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet congressional decorum prevented the lawmakers from talking openly about 
the looming crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with Rostenkowski possibly on the verge of a plea bargain for 
financial abuse of his office, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) called an extraordinary press conference to declare that he has no 
interest in assuming the leadership of the committee to help secure the 
enactment of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in a way it's an insult to the chairman and the members of the 
committee that I or someone else from the leadership would have to go to the 
committee so the committee could finish its work on health care," Gephardt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) also was unwilling to talk openly 
about the ramifications of the Rostenkowski matter. "I'm not going to presume 
the resignation of Mr. Rostenkowski. That's something I have no knowledge 
about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was less reticent, however, to discuss the 
effect Rostenkowski's departure would have on the Administration's health care 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly hope that doesn't come to pass, but it would be an obstacle that 
Congress would have to figure out how to overcome," she said at an 
International Women's Media Foundation conference here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a great loss to Congress, but health care reform and the need for 
it is bigger than any one person in this country," she later told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), a senior member of the panel 
and a Rostenkowski loyalist, remained uncharacteristically close-lipped about 
his own intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Congress and their aides have speculated that, if Matsui 
challenges ranking committee Democrat Sam Gibbons of Florida for the 
chairmanship, Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward) 
-- both of whom are senior to Matsui -- also would seek the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The nervousness over the chairmanship reflects widespread concern that Gibbons 
lacks Rostenkowski's deal-making skills. He also is more a specialist in trade 
than health care. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rostenkowski leaves, the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee would 
then recommend a chairman to the Democratic Caucus. If the ranking member of 
the committee gets the nod, he would be entitled to a separate up-or-down vote 
before any alternative was considered, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tension grew on Capitol Hill, sources close to the negotiations between 
Rostenkowski's lawyers and U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. indicated that the 
matter will not be resolved until next week. Holder reportedly was pressing for 
a decision on the plea agreement by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office has been investigating Rostenkowski for alleged 
misuse of office and campaign accounts, including the possibility that he 
improperly received money from the House post office, hired employees who did 
no work and made improper furniture and gift purchases from his office funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A plea agreement would enable him to avoid the humiliation of a public trial 
and the prospect of conviction and a lengthy prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief barrier to an agreement, sources said, has been the wording of any 
charge to which Rostenkowski would plead guilty. The precise description of the 
charge would be crucial in determining the punishment that U.S. District Judge 
Norma H. Johnson could mete out under federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines require judges to explain in writing any departure they make 
from the sentences outlined for various crimes. The sentences are affected by 
such factors as the amount of money involved, whether the defendant abused a 
position of public trust and whether he has accepted responsibility for his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fraud conviction involving a loss of more than $200,000, for example, the 
guidelines call for a sentence of 15 months to 21 months for a defendant with 
no prior criminal history. If the loss is between $70,000 and $120,000, the 
sentence would range from 10 months to 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fraud conviction involving an abuse of a position of public or private 
trust, the guidelines call for increasing the time of incarceration. In a 
$70,000-plus fraud, for example, the sentence would rise to 15 months to 21 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines also provide for decreasing the sentence if the defendant 
"clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense."

'FAMILY CAP' ON WELFARE BENEFITS WILL GET BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending months of intense debate within the Administration, President Clinton 
will propose making it easier for states to deny additional benefits to women 
who have children while on welfare, senior Administration officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision aligns Clinton with those inside and outside the Administration 
who argue that government must intensify its efforts to discourage 
out-of-wedlock births, which now constitute about 30% of all births in the 
United States. "We think it is very important to discourage additional births 
on welfare," one senior official said. "We are saying that states that want to 
try this approach should be able to try it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the "family cap" policy inspires even more intense opposition among 
liberals than the proposed two-year time limit on benefits that is at the 
center of Clinton's welfare reform plan, which is now expected to be introduced 
shortly after the President returns from commemorating the 50th anniversary of 
D-day in Europe next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Given its potential to affect the most intimate decisions of millions of 
women, the family cap issue is certain to provoke a polarized struggle in 
Congress. Many moderate and conservative legislators see the family cap as a 
way to promote personal responsibility, whereas liberals largely denounce it as 
racist and sexist social engineering. No other proposal may more starkly 
demonstrate the difficulty of finding common ground between left and right on 
the emotional issues swirling through welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly one where there are very deep feelings on both sides of the 
issue and, apart from the families it directly affects, it has a large symbolic 
impact," said Mark Greenberg, an attorney with the Center for Law and Social 
Policy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, although Clinton settled on the new policy at a Tuesday meeting, 
Administration officials still appear divided over how closely to identify with 
the controversial idea. Some officials took pains to say that the 
Administration does not intend to push states to adopt family cap policies, 
merely to smooth the way for those interested in the idea. One agency official 
lukewarm to the policy insisted that the decision leaves the Administration 
"neutral" on the question of whether more states should adopt the caps. 
</P>
<P>
 But other senior officials acknowledged that by signaling at least tacit 
federal support for the family cap, the Administration plan inevitably will 
encourage more states to embrace the idea. Outside observers agreed. 
"Inevitably, by framing it as a state option, it will be taken as a federal 
encouragement," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In opening the way for wider use of the family cap, Clinton continued a 
movement toward the center that has characterized his final decisions on the 
welfare plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks ago, Clinton rejected the idea of imposing a new casino tax as a 
way to pay for more child-care assistance for the working poor -- a proposal 
fervently supported by liberals. And, although agreeing to phase in his 
proposed two-year time limit by imposing it on younger people first, the 
President has decided to allow states to require work after two years for older 
welfare recipients as well, senior officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal, like the family cap, reflects Clinton's intention to give 
states more flexibility in managing welfare reform, officials said. Clinton 
will also propose easing the way for states to condition welfare grants for 
teen-agers on their school attendance and to encourage work by allowing 
recipients to keep more of their earnings without reducing their benefits, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion of states trying different approaches and learning what we can 
from those different approaches makes enormous common sense and political 
sense," said Delaware Gov. Thomas R. Carper, a Democrat who presented the 
Administration proposals to a closed session of the National Governors' Assn. 
executive board Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sign of how far the welfare reform debate has shifted in the last year 
that the family cap Clinton will propose -- although anathema to liberal 
advocacy groups -- occupies a middle ground among the competing efforts to 
discourage out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 As a presidential candidate, Clinton declared that he would allow states to 
experiment with the family cap proposal -- although he declined to sign such a 
law when he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration plan reflects that perspective. It would not require states 
to impose a family cap, but it would allow them to implement such policies 
without federal approval, sources said. Under current law, states cannot 
implement such policies without waivers from the Health and Human Services 
Department, a process that can take months and require extensive negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three states have received federal approval for a family cap plan. The 
George Bush Administration approved a proposal from New Jersey and the Clinton 
Administration has approved plans in Georgia and Arkansas. Applications are 
pending from California, Maryland and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Early results in New Jersey, the only state that has actually implemented a 
family cap, show that births have declined among welfare mothers since the 
policy went into place. But it remains uncertain whether those numbers reflect 
the cap's impact, a general decline in childbearing in the state, or a 
decreased willingness among welfare recipients to report new births.

NEEDY LAPD BECOMES A CHARITY OF CHOICE; PHILANTHROPY: CASH, COMPUTERS AND MORE 
HAVE BEEN DONATED. FEAR OF CRIME MAY BE CREATING A GENEROUS PUBLIC MOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The latest cause gaining appeal in Los Angeles is not AIDS or the homeless or 
even the rain forest. It's the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 With such recent offerings as cash, computers, cameras, furniture -- even a 
motor home -- donations to the LAPD in the past five months have surpassed the 
tally for all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in donations, from private citizens, businesses and other 
government agencies, has been attributed partly to city officials' effort to 
prod the private sector into helping the city during its fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But some police officials speculate that residents and businesses are chipping 
in because they feel helpless in the war against crime and want to do their 
part to assist the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's kind of an outpouring of support predicated on the fact that we 
have just been through some tumultuous experiences," said Al Beuerlein, who 
heads the department's financial support bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in the west San Fernando Valley have fared particularly well at drawing 
donations over the past year, receiving thousands of dollars worth of 
computers, bicycles, automobiles and high-tech cameras used to produce 
extra-sharp photographs of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, 13 personal computers donated by Great Western Bank are being 
used to help officers write crime reports. Because reports can be written 
faster, police are including more details, which they believe improves the 
chances of a suspect being convicted if the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even guess at the number of hours this has saved us," said West 
Valley Detective Dave Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city records, 16 donations have been accepted for the department 
so far this year, four more than all of last year. Because most donations to 
the LAPD are goods such as used computers and cars, police officials could not 
provide a cash total for offerings or a precise breakdown of how much each 
station has received. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the department has taken in $22,000 in cash, 41 computers, 100 
cellular phones, a 1972 motor home, a 1993 Ford wagon, office furniture and a 
facsimile machine, among other donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who still rely mostly on pen and paper to keep records, say any 
computer -- regardless of its age -- is a godsend. Some donations have come 
when companies upgrade their computers and donate the old models. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can donate what you would consider to be a dinosaur and it's a Porsche to 
us," Navarro said. "You should see the faces light up when we see a computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, furniture and desks are donated when a company consolidates or 
shrinks its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the city's campaign to draw donations to the police are Mayor Richard 
Riordan and Councilwoman Laura Chick, both of whom came into office last July 
and immediately began tapping community groups and private firms to beef up a 
department so fiscally strapped that officers have not had a raise in two years 
and use dilapidated equipment such as cars with more than 100,000 miles on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Riordan's efforts to increase donations, next month the City 
Council is expected to approve a special trust fund for the Police Department 
to cut down on the red tape that delays the acceptance of donations for at 
least two weeks until the council can consider them. The trust fund would 
eliminate the requirement of council approval for donations valued under 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley Sgt. Walt Kainz attributes most of the increase in donations his 
division has garnered to Chick's efforts. They have included turning over more 
than $80,000 from her office budget to the division and giving the department 
three of the seven city cars assigned to her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also encouraged residents to make donations through the West Valley 
Police Athletic League Supporters, a nonprofit booster organization that uses 
cash donations to purchase equipment for the division, Kainz said. Contributors 
to such organizations can get a tax write-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Money donated through West Valley PALS was used to purchase a sophisticated 
$700 camera that police use to photograph needle marks on the arms of suspected 
drug users for use as evidence in court, Kainz said. The camera originally used 
by the department was damaged during the Northridge earthquake and the Police 
Department lacked the cash to replace it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-tech camera that was purchased for $800 with donated funds uses 
ultraviolet light to photograph crime-scene fingerprints that cannot be lifted 
using conventional methods, he said. Last week, police said they used the 
camera to link a suspect to a truckload of stolen computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some donations have come by chance. Recently, Kainz said, a group of 
residents asked if they could send some information to the station via 
facsimile. When police told the group that no such machine was available, the 
group donated $250 for police to buy one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motivations behind the donations vary. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Duskin Co. Ltd., a cleaning-equipment rental firm based in 
Osaka, Japan, said the firm donated $20,000 -- the biggest cash donation in 
recent months -- to the Police Department's Asian Crime Investigation unit 
because an executive vice president was acquainted with a sergeant and wanted 
to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Rice Honda Co. of La Puente loaned the LAPD two Sea-Doo watercraft, 
similar to oversize jet skis, for a year to be used, in part, to make rescues 
when the Los Angeles River overflows. Tim Rice, vice president of the firm, 
said American Honda offers the use of its products not only to assist police 
but for the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the Sea-Doos to be seen out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the LAPD has received such unusual offerings as a 4-year-old 
gelding Thoroughbred named Mesa Blaze from an Oxnard resident in 1992 to be 
used in the department's mounted police unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Jack LaLanne donated physical fitness equipment and the use of his 
Pasadena gym. In 1988, American Honda donated three all-terrain vehicles. The 
staff of the television show "Hunter" got into the act in 1990 by donating a 
cellular phone.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: 2 WINNERS, 2 LOSERS IN 3-WAY DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two winners and two losers emerged from this week's televised debates between 
the three Democratic candidates for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners were Treasurer Kathleen Brown and state Sen. Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers: Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the debate performances will be decisive in the June 7 primary. That 
contest seems to have been decided for Brown many months ago, if the polls are 
correct. As for the November election, these debates will wind up just as a 
footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two clashes Monday and Tuesday nights in Sacramento and San Francisco 
-- the latter also was televised in Southern California -- were the biggest 
showcase events of the campaign. And they brought some political realities 
clearly into focus: 
</P>
<P>
 * We'd known for a long time that Brown had the drive, the so-called fire in 
the belly, to run all-out for the job once held by her father and brother. Now 
it should be obvious to everyone but the most anti-Brown partisan that she also 
has the vital combination of poise and toughness necessary to get elected and 
govern effectively. Brown may lack other attributes -- experience, a command of 
details -- but she can take hits without being rattled and then deck her 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garamendi may have the knowledge, the experience and the vision necessary to 
be a good governor, but he apparently lacks the political skills -- call them 
people skills -- to get elected. To use the old football metaphor, Garamendi 
needed to complete a long bomb for a touchdown and instead he tripped over his 
own feet and got sacked. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilson is not easily discouraged, but the uncharismatic governor could not 
have enjoyed watching the telegenic treasurer's coolness under fire as he 
anticipated debating her in the fall. And she was improving by the hour; this 
was her spring training. What's more, Wilson must have grimaced as Brown -- and 
her Democratic rivals -- constantly attacked his GOP stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the candidate who gained the most, relatively, was Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 For many TV viewers, this was one of the few times they had seen the former 
anti-war protester when he wasn't traipsing after his ex-wife, Jane Fonda, or 
visiting Hanoi or being arrested at a Democratic convention riot, all scenes 
from decades past. 
</P>
<P>
 In these debates, Hayden was not the classic radical; he was the voice of 
candor and reason, and that probably altered his image, particularly for 
younger voters. He was both amusing and serious. And it showed what can happen 
when a politician knows he can't win, isn't afraid to alienate voter blocs, and 
relaxes and speaks his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica liberal pushed his case for political reform, but with velvet 
gloves. "These are good people in a bad system," he said of Brown and 
Garamendi. "It's a system . . . that causes (candidates) to spend too much time 
on the phone trying to raise money from people they'd probably rather not spend 
any time with at all." 
</P>
<P>
 At that, Brown -- obviously agreeing -- nearly doubled over while fighting 
back laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Garamendi was too combative, too contrived and too clumsy. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the first debate by asking Brown: "Is it not true that there is an 
SEC investigation" of her dealings with politically friendly Wall Street bond 
houses? Brown denied it and Garamendi later admitted to reporters that he had 
no evidence of a probe. But he kept hurling the charge anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi closed the second debate with this strange, unexplained comment: 
"Oh, I have been waiting nine months for you to ask me those questions, 
Kathleen. I have been waiting nine months. " There were loud boos from the 
large audience; presumably they were Brown supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had just asked Garamendi about the "five audits" of his Insurance 
Department that had found "waste, mismanagement and abuse." Also, she noted, 
journals had described his takeover of a failed insurance company as "botched, 
bungled and dumb." And "your recklessness with the truth," she said, "is 
somewhat like Joe McCarthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has a rare ability to smile disarmingly as she gets angry and tears into 
her opponent. Later, she told reporters, "I thought I knocked it out of the 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 But the big league pitching of Wilson will be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown still needs to answer why she personally opposes the death penalty; the 
electorate probably will demand more than just her promise to enforce it. And 
she needs to be more convincing -- show emotion -- when she insists, "I'm 
running because I'm angry at the decline of California." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate win was important, but it's still only spring training.

2 CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF TOURISTS; CRIME: A THIRD SUSPECT IS BEING SOUGHT IN 
THE SLAYING OF A GERMAN WOMAN AND THE WOUNDING OF HER HUSBAND NEAR IDYLLWILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 19-year-old Banning residents were arrested early Wednesday by Riverside 
County Sheriff's Department homicide investigators in the slaying of a 
62-year-old German tourist and the wounding of her husband last week near 
Idyllwild. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the two men were associates of an Asian street gang, but that 
gang activity was not believed to be a factor in the attack on the couple. They 
were shot at a scenic viewpoint alongside California 243, overlooking Hemet in 
the San Jacinto Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 A third suspect remains at large, said Deputy Mark Lohman, a Sheriff's 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came nine days after the May 16 robbery and killing, which left 
Gisela Pfleger dead from gunshot wounds to her head. Her husband, Klaus 
Pfleger, 64, was critically wounded with two gunshots to his face and another 
in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 At a crowded news conference Wednesday, Lohman offered no details of the 
investigation that led to the arrest of the two teen-agers after an all-night 
interrogation. He said the handgun believed to have been used in the shooting 
and the suspected getaway car were seized by detectives who searched four homes 
in the Banning area Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teen-agers who were taken in for questioning Tuesday afternoon were 
released Wednesday. All five had been rounded up without resistance Tuesday 
when more than 30 law enforcement officers served search warrants 
simultaneously at four Banning residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman identified the shooting suspects as Xou Yang and Khamchan (Brett) 
Ketsouvannasane. Both were born in Laos and are legal U.S. residents, he said. 
They were being held at a Riverside County detention center in Murrieta on 
$250,000 bail, and were expected to be arraigned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Bentley said his office would 
decide today whether to prosecute the suspects as a capital case because of the 
special circumstances of a murder in the commission of a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman would not disclose whether the two suspects were previously known to 
law enforcement authorities or had criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
 He credited the arrests to "dozens and dozens of tips and leads and good 
old-fashioned police work" that involved more than 100 officers from several 
police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said the suspects were connected to "an Asian gang that has ties 
throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State University sociology professor Kenji Ima said that unlike 
geographically defined Latino gangs, Southeast Asian gangs are typically mobile 
and far-flung. Lohman reiterated Wednesday that the Pflegers apparently were 
the tragic victims of a random act and were not targeted as foreign tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had arrived in Southern California three days before the shooting 
to visit a daughter in Redondo Beach and for sightseeing. They drove an 
unmarked rental car up the winding, two-lane mountain highway from Banning. The 
couple pulled over to the side of the road eight miles from Idyllwild to take 
in the view at the Indian Vista lookout. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what words, if any, were exchanged between the assailants and 
the German-speaking couple before the shooting erupted. Gisela Pfleger died at 
the scene but her husband was able to struggle to his car and drive half a mile 
to a parking lot, where a passerby summoned help. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of the husband, a retired customs worker, was upgraded to fair 
Wednesday by his physicians at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his shattered jaw, Pfleger has communicated clues to investigators 
primarily by writing notes in German.

MURDER VICTIM WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, COURT PAPERS SHOW; CRIME: CHARGES FILED 
AGAINST PAROLED RAPIST EDWARD MORGAN REVEAL GRISLY DETAILS OF WOMAN'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In filing charges that would make Edward Patrick Morgan eligible for the death 
penalty, prosecutors disclosed for the first time Wednesday that the 
23-year-old Huntington Beach woman whom the three-time rapist is accused of 
murdering was also sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 28, made his first court appearance here since his capture Monday in 
the small Northern California town of Quincy, where he had fled over the 
weekend in an attempt to elude a search that was launched after the victim's 
body was discovered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stood before Central Orange County Municipal Judge Barbara (Tam) Nomoto 
to hear the charges against him, Morgan displayed no emotion. The judge ordered 
that he be held without bail until his June 10 arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum said that Leonora Wong, 23, was sexually 
assaulted with a foreign object and that her body was so mangled and mutilated 
that authorities have had difficulty conducting the usual rape tests. One law 
enforcement source who declined to be identified said authorities were still 
trying to find the object used to mutilate Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Wong and Morgan met Thursday night at an Orange nightclub, 
where Wong had gone with a girlfriend. Her body was discovered at the rear of a 
parking lot across the street from the nightclub. Authorities said she suffered 
severe upper body and pelvic injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Morgan had been linked to the crime by fingerprints, witnesses who 
saw him with the victim, and other evidence, including a security camera 
mounted on a nearby building. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors have not yet discussed what evidence the video camera 
may have captured. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has struck a nerve with many who believe the legal system failed 
again and again when it came to Morgan, who has been accused of raping young 
Orange County women four times in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was flown back to Orange County from Northern California on Tuesday, a 
crowd of about 100 angry onlookers booed and jeered as he was escorted from the 
chartered airplane that delivered him to Orange County authorities at the 
Fullerton Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Wednesday was Donna Renee Tatum, 28, of Ontario, who is accused of 
harboring Morgan by driving him to Northern California, Rosenblum said. One of 
Tatum's friends who was in court, however, said Tatum feared that Morgan would 
kill her if she did not help him leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In two of the three rape complaints that were formally filed against Morgan, 
the criminal justice system allowed him off on less serious charges -- 
statutory rape -- and in a fourth case, he was not prosecuted. Instead, the 
Orange County district attorney's office declined to prosecute and allowed 
Morgan to be returned to prison for the remaining 12 months of his prison 
sentence for his third rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors said they did the best they could, but added that 
many of the cases were weak and raised questions about the credibility of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan also narrowly avoided yet another possible parole revocation within 
days of Wong's murder. He tested positive for cocaine May 10 and the results 
were completed by May 17, but Morgan's parole officer did not have evidence 
that he had violated the terms of his parole by using drugs until authorities 
were already searching for him in connection with the slaying, said Tip Kindel, 
spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.

 Kindel said Morgan had passed several urine and other drug tests since his 
release from prison in late March, but it is likely his parole would have been 
revoked after the urine test. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that kind of a background as a sex offender and a drug user, it is 
likely he would have been taken back into custody immediately," said Kindel, 
who said his office is investigating the delay in reporting the drug test 
results and implementing a new notification system to make sure it does not 
happen again.

5 DIE IN CAMP PENDLETON CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three young women and two children were killed Wednesday morning at Camp 
Pendleton when their small car crashed into a bus on a rain-slicked two-lane 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 The five dead were among seven people in a Ford Escort that collided with a 
North County Transit District bus about 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Two children were taken to hospitals with minor injuries. Neither the bus 
driver nor any of the passengers on the Route 303 bus were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunnery Sgt. Norm Cosme, a Marine spokesman, said the initial investigation 
indicates that the Ford Escort careened into the opposite lane. The bus 
suffered only minor damage, but the Ford was crumpled nearly in half. 
Metal-cutting tools had to be used to pry the bodies from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the passengers were dead at the scene and a fifth was pronounced dead 
after being taken by helicopter to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car was identified as Lisa Strauss, 19, of Fallbrook. Also 
killed were Michelle Davis, 18, of Oceanside and her 2-year-old son. The names 
of a 24-year-old woman and her 4-year-old daughter who were also killed were 
not released because not all relatives had been contacted Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-month-old boy was taken to the base hospital with bruises. A 4-year-old 
boy was taken to Children's Hospital in San Diego for abdominal surgery and was 
reported in stable condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the driver was not wearing a seat belt and the adult 
passenger in the front seat was wearing only a lap belt. One of the surviving 
children was in an infant seat, but it was unclear whether any of the other 
children wore seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 A transit district spokeswoman said that under district policy, the driver of 
the 44-seat bus was given drug and alcohol tests immediately after the crash. 
Results of those tests were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Route 303 is one of the busiest of the transit district's 29 routes, with 
buses arriving at Camp Pendleton every 30 minutes during peak hours. The 
sprawling base has 34,000 Marines and sailors. About half live off base and 
many use public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The route enters Pendleton's main gate off Interstate 5 and takes a circuitous 
route before leaving at the camp's San Luis Rey gate east of Oceanside. The 
crash occurred on a hilly two-lane road near the Camp Margarita portion of the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Stagecoach Road was slick from the morning fog and a light rain at the time of 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Marines who were riding in the bus rushed to help the injured in the car. 
"The two (surviving) kids were screaming," a lance corporal said. "That was the 
worst part." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the car was descending a winding road on a small hill when it 
spun out of control and collided with the bus. Both drivers slammed on their 
brakes seconds before the crash.

DEMOCRATS SQUARE OFF IN FINAL DEBATE; POLITICS: KATHLEEN BROWN SPENDS MOST OF 
THE TIME ATTACKING PETE WILSON. GARAMENDI CONFRONTS HER ON DEATH PENALTY ISSUE. 
HAYDEN TRIES TO DRAW ATTENTION TO FAULTS IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An occasionally nasty and frequently illuminating series of debates between 
the three Democratic candidates for governor ended Wednesday with frontrunner 
Kathleen Brown seeking to turn her fire on her prospective November opponent, 
Pete Wilson -- but finding her own views the subject of continuing, contentious 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly during a two-hour radio debate moderated by KABC radio announcer 
Michael Jackson, the state treasurer blamed Wilson for everything from the 
California recession to the influx of illegal immigrants and a delay in the 
siting of a proposed nuclear waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressing her campaign slogan -- that she will try to create 1 million jobs 
during her first term -- Brown said the state needs "a governor who 
understands, appreciates and is willing to invest in California's future." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can create 1 million new jobs in the state, we can end the Wilson 
recession," Brown contended in the third debate in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as she sought to look past her June opponents -- Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden -- to Wilson, Brown was 
hobbled by her refusal to explain her personal objections to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the effort to draw out Brown's beliefs took a comic turn. After 
twice being rebuffed when he asked her to explain her personal objections, 
Jackson virtually begged the treasurer for details. 
</P>
<P>
 "But why are you against it? Why don't you like it? (Pretend) I'm your child. 
'Mommy, what's wrong with the death penalty?' I need to know where you are 
coming from," Jackson pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown refused once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have simply very long-held personal beliefs and opinions that I am not 
prepared to change for elective office," she said. "And I see it as an issue 
that politicians and, quite frankly, the press uses when we have so many 
problems in this state. We have had the death penalty for over 12 years and 
what we need to have is a governor who is going to focus in on how we're going 
to stop the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson retorted: "I still don't know why you're against it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Brown responded sharply: "But what you do know, Michael, and what the 
people of California know, is that I will enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi sought to further Jackson's inquiry, demanding to know whether 
judges appointed by Brown would support the death penalty -- she indicated that 
they would -- and taking an aggressive position himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "You murder somebody in cold blood in California when I'm governor and you can 
expect that your life will be taken in an execution," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, noting that 1,200 killings occurred in the area last year, asked: 
"How many people would you put to death? Every single person who kills someone 
else?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way it's going to be," Garamendi replied. "Enough of this kind of 
playing around." 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve hundred executions?" Jackson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, 1,200 executions," Garamendi said. He later explained that he favors 
executions for capital offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did in the first two debates -- held Monday in Sacramento and Tuesday in 
San Francisco -- the third candidate, Hayden, looked over the Brown-Garamendi 
battles with something approaching detached amusement. He was seated between 
the two at the debate site, a ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. At one 
point his head whipped back and forth from one to another, as if he was a 
tennis referee in the midst of a big game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden also provided many of the debate's most thoughtful moments, taking on 
Brown and Garamendi for their political positions yet praising them as 
well-meaning public servants. The approach was in keeping with the Santa Monica 
senator's contention that the political system -- and not this year's crop of 
Democrats -- is corrupt and in need of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think John and Kathleen are very public-spirited people and very good 
people and most of my colleagues in the Legislature -- except those who have 
departed because of the decisions of juries -- are also very good people," said 
Hayden, alluding to the recent convictions of several legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you have basically a system of terrible temptations." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said Brown and Garamendi had given state contracts to campaign 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why the state is in such bad shape, because the state bureaucracy is 
riddled with favoritism -- and that's why we can't get more attention to 
greater funding for schools . . . because the state budget has already been 
dipped into by lobbyists for special interests," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio debate was the longest of the three sessions and covered broad 
ground, from campaign reform to immigration to schools. Garamendi, picking up 
where he left off Tuesday night, continued to accuse Brown of being under 
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, John, you don't know what you're talking about," Brown told her 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC's chief spokeswoman, Jennifer Kimball, on Wednesday flatly denied that 
the agency was investigating Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from responding to his gibes, Brown ignored Garamendi and used the final 
primary debate as practice against Wilson. She said that the governor's 
television ads, which feature footage of illegal immigrants running across the 
border, were "inciting fear." She contended that Wilson had done nothing about 
the issue of immigration when he was a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have a little truth-in-packaging here for what he has done and 
what he's failed to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also blamed Wilson for delays in the decision whether to locate a nuclear 
dump in Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown took no position on whether the dump should be allowed, saying only 
that hearings must be held. Garamendi agreed, but Hayden flatly opposed the 
dump.

SYRIA IS DRAGGING ITS FEET ON FULL TIES, PERES CHARGES; MIDEAST: ISRAEL WILL 
NOT GIVE UP GOLAN HEIGHTS WITHOUT BETTER RELATIONS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS. 
HE ALSO WARNS ARAFAT ON HONORING PEACE PACT. 
</P>

 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres complained Wednesday that Syria has 
refused to commit itself to full diplomatic relations and open borders in its 
peace talks with Israel and indicated that his government will not withdraw 
from the Golan Heights for anything less. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, who met with Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher during a visit to Washington, also warned Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat that he risks destroying his agreement with Israel over autonomy for the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho by continuing to quibble about its 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting with reporters, Peres was asked whether Israel had committed 
itself to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which was captured by 
Israeli forces in the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 He responded: "Do the Syrians suggest opening (negotiations) by having a 
full-fledged peace with Israel? Do they suggest having a full arrangement on 
security? No. They say peace without embassies, without open frontiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Syria and Israel have exchanged proposals for a peace agreement for the last 
month, using Christopher as a go-between. Syria has hinted unofficially that it 
is willing to consider full peace with Israel but has not changed its official 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, after meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad, President Clinton 
said that the Syrian leader told him he was ready to seek full peace, including 
normal diplomatic relations. But Assad refused to confirm that in public and 
said such issues need to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres also said he considers "irrelevant" a decree by Arafat canceling Israeli 
laws in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, Palestinian areas from which Israel has 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot sit down, reach an agreement on the declaration of principles and 
then go around and declare different things," he warned. "If you devaluate a 
word of an agreement, you kill the peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked so hard to reach the declaration, and the test of the two sides is 
to remain true in letter and spirit to the declaration of principles," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, speaking at the beginning of his meeting with Peres, said he 
believes that Arafat should reaffirm the commitments he made to Israel in their 
agreement on Jericho and Gaza earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commitments have been made. It is very important that they be lived up to. I 
think it would be very helpful to have a reaffirmation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has made several statements that cast doubt on his intention to remain 
faithful to the accord, under which Israel agreed to turn Jericho and Gaza over 
to the PLO in exchange for assurances that it would retain ultimate security 
control over the areas.

POLITICS; FOREIGN POLICY MISSTEPS WOUND CLINTON'S STANDING AT HOME; ATTACKS ON 
THE PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE ARE COMING FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. A 
TANGLE OF GLOBAL DILEMMAS OFFERS LITTLE HOPE FOR RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton, who has staked his presidency on achieving bold domestic policy 
goals, suddenly appears to be jeopardizing his political future with his 
handling of U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is accumulating: Some of Clinton's poll ratings are wilting; 
Republicans -- including former President George Bush and GOP presidential 
prospects for 1996 -- are pounding him and discontent is spreading on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 And with foreign policy dilemmas plaguing him around the globe, stretching 
from Haiti to Bosnia to North Korea and China, the future offers the President 
little hope for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid preparations for Clinton's trip to Europe next week to commemorate the 
50th anniversary of D-day and to bolster strained relationships with Western 
allies, some advisers wonder whether the President might have underestimated 
the importance of foreign policy while he was lavishing attention on domestic 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can envision a Republican candidate in 1996, someone like (former Defense 
Secretary) Dick Cheney or (former Secretary of State) Jim Baker, who campaigns 
on the slogan: 'It's foreign policy, stupid,' " fretted a veteran of Clinton's 
1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Republicans are already on the attack. "Our leadership around the 
world is being eroded by a stop-and-start policy of hesitancy," Bush said at a 
GOP fund-raiser May 17 in Milwaukee, according to the Milwaukee Sentinel 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), a potential presidential contender 
in 1996, mocked Clinton's recent 90-minute televised press conference on 
international affairs. "You shouldn't have to have a television show with 
someone scripting the answers to demonstrate what you know about leadership," 
Dole said at a party rally in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic grievance against Clinton is this: In dealing with an array of 
problems abroad, such as the bloody conflict in Bosnia, the intransigence of 
the military regime in Haiti, the nuclear threat from North Korea and human 
rights violations in China, he seems to have talked loudly but carried a small 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I continue to look for new solutions," the President has said in his own 
defense. His supporters blame his difficulties on the turbulent state of 
post-Cold War diplomacy, which has forced him to sail on uncharted seas. While 
some Americans are urging him to steer clear of foreign crises, others are 
demanding stronger action. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're damned if you do and damned if you don't," argued Democratic National 
Committee Chairman David Wilhelm. "These are tough and difficult situations." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is getting a bad rap," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.), who contends that Clinton does not get the credit that he deserves 
for winning congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Likening present conditions to the chaotic years after World War II, Foley 
noted that it took President Harry S. Truman nearly two years to develop 
policies for dealing with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts warn that Clinton's penchant for wheeling and dealing -- 
contrasted with Truman's characteristic bluntness and decisiveness -- can 
backfire in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In foreign policy, it's important to present a firm image," said Princeton 
University presidential scholar Fred Greenstein. "With Clinton, it's like globs 
of mercury; he's all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's task is not an easy one. "In the post-Cold War era, no one knows 
what foreign policy ought to be," conceded Leslie Gelb, a former State 
Department official in the Jimmy Carter Administration. Gelb now serves as 
president of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Clinton's critics argue that the President is making the job more 
difficult with his inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't go Chinese menu week by week on foreign policy and expect the 
American people to support you," said Hodding Carter III, who was spokesman for 
the State Department during the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's policies are drawing fire across the political spectrum. From the 
right, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) scoffs at Clinton's initiative 
for dealing with the potential flood of refugees from Haiti by establishing 
seaborne processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a level of sloppiness about this Administration that is kind of 
scary," the conservative Georgia congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the left, Maurice Paprin, head of the liberal-oriented Fund for New 
Priorities, left a recent White House briefing convinced that U.S. policy 
toward Haiti is "as unclear and muddy as it was before." 
</P>
<P>
 The President seemingly raised the political stakes for his Haiti policies 
recently when he offered a detailed justification for U.S. invasion of that 
strife-torn island nation if economic sanctions do not force the military 
government from office. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Haitian regime stands firm despite the sanctions, Clinton will have 
to risk launching a military assault with unforeseeable consequences or face 
intensified complaints that he lacks the will to manage foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even longtime allies of the President, such as Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), 
who chairs the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group that helped 
propel Clinton to the presidency, have joined the disapproving chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have conducted ourselves abroad with an unsteady hand," McCurdy said in an 
address to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco last month. "In Bosnia, 
blustery rhetoric faded into reluctant diplomacy. . . . On North Korea, we have 
been anything but decisive." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans warn that shifting positions on current problems can create even 
more serious troubles in the future. "To the extent that you use up your 
credibility, then when you get into a real crisis you'll pay the price," former 
Defense Secretary Cheney told members of the National Retail Federation here 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is already paying a political price for the controversies surrounding 
his foreign policy, according to recent polls. Only 40% of those interviewed in 
a Washington Post-ABC News survey released last week approved of his handling 
of foreign policy, against 53% who disapproved. The negative showing on foreign 
policy apparently contributed to lowering the President's overall approval 
rating to 51%, from 57% in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreign policy is not just about foreign affairs, it's also an opportunity 
for the President to display leadership capabilities in the one arena in which 
he can do so with fewest challenges," said Everett Carll Ladd, director of the 
Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. "We have loads of evidence that 
people form impressions of presidents by what they see of them on the world 
stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring Clinton's difficulties abroad, and conceivably complicating them, 
are increasing signs of congressional restlessness with his leadership on 
foreign affairs. The most striking example is a Senate vote two weeks ago for 
an amendment ordering the President to unilaterally lift the United 
Nations-imposed embargo on selling arms to Bosnia, even if America's North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies do not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the top Republican on the Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending on foreign aid, predicted 
more congressional involvement in foreign affairs on such issues as curbing 
development of North Korea's nuclear capability and granting "most favored 
nation" trade status to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden," McConnell said, "an issue the President has no interest in, 
and he thinks the American people aren't interested in, is becoming a major 
political liability." A Low Point in Poll 
</P>
<P>

record low. But foreign affairs is still not a priority issue for most

RWANDA 'GENOCIDE' ANGERS, FRUSTRATES U.N. CHIEF; PEACEKEEPING: BOUTROS-GHALI 
CALLS INTERNATIONAL INACTION 'A FAILURE.' HE ALSO EXPRESSES SCORN FOR U.S. 
POLICY.

 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, bristling with anger and frustration, 
derided the international community Wednesday for talking but doing little else 
to stop genocide in Rwanda. He denounced the inaction as a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are responsible for this failure," the secretary general told a 
news conference. "It is a genocide which has been committed. More than 200,000 
people have been killed, and . . . the international community is still 
discussing what ought to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried," he said. "I have been in contact with different heads of state 
and begged them to send troops. . . . Unfortunately, let us say with great 
humility, I failed. It is a scandal. I am the first one to say it. And I am 
ready to repeat it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he never singled out the United States for criticism, Boutros-Ghali 
mocked the philosophy behind President Clinton's recent policy directive on 
peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this policy, which U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine 
Albright invoked last week to force the Security Council to delay the dispatch 
of 5,500 troops to Rwanda, the Clinton Administration insists that it will not 
approve peacekeeping operations until they are subjected to close scrutiny, 
including an assessment of their chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must accept that in certain operations we will not be successful," 
Boutros-Ghali said. "And the fact that you are not successful in a certain 
operation must not be an obstacle to additional operations all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like going to a hospital," he said. "You cannot say, 'I don't want to 
take this case.' There is a moral responsibility. The raison d'etre of this 
organization is to help member states solve peacefully their internal disputes 
and their international disputes." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali, a 71-year-old former Egyptian diplomat and law professor, also 
used the news conference to make what amounted to a declaration of his intent 
to seek a second five-year term in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a sharp change of course. When he was elected in late 1991, 
Boutros-Ghali insisted that he intended to serve only one term, a posture that 
would give him great independence from the five members of the Security 
Council, which have the power of veto, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to justify his change of intent, the secretary general told the 
news conference, "I believe that only stupid people don't change their mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question will be raised in 1996," he said, "and it will depend on my own 
physical capacities. If I am feeling in shape, quite honestly, I will say yes. 
On the other hand . . . if I don't feel well enough, then I won't request a 
second term." 
</P>
<P>
 Mocking the philosophy behind the Clinton Administration's policies will not 
help any Boutros-Ghali campaign for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Washington and the secretary general have been tense for 
much of the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali has been angered about the U.S. attempt to blame him for the 
debacle in Somalia. The Americans have been angered by his penchant for setting 
policy rather than just taking orders from the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, using its veto, could block a second term for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest council resolution on Rwanda authorizes the 5,500-strong 
peacekeeping force but delays sending more than a few hundred until the 
secretary general satisfies the ambassadors with progress toward a cease-fire, 
approval from the warring parties, a timetable, a military strategy and 
commitments of troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general told the news conference that he has failed so far to 
round up the troops. He said that Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal have officially 
agreed to send a total of 2,200 soldiers. He said he is discussing the 
possibility of more troops from Egypt, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. But he said he 
still does not have firm offers for equipment or transportation for these 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the squabbling in the Security Council over the Rwanda resolution had 
made it more difficult for him to recruit troops, the secretary general did not 
reply directly but instead spoke of "a fatigue among the donor countries." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops now take part in 17 peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Geneva, the U.N. Human Rights Commission, meeting in an emergency 
session, was preparing to name a special investigator to look for evidence of 
crimes against humanity in Rwanda, even though there is no international 
criminal court that could punish the guilty.

RWANDA REBELS, ARMY TRADE MORTAR FIRE; AFRICA: FIGHTING BLOCKS RELIEF SUPPLIES. 
U.N. OFFICIALS WARN OF FOOD AND MEDICAL SHORTAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rwanda's battered army in Kigali regrouped Wednesday and exchanged heavy 
mortar fire into the evening with rebel guerrillas who captured a strategic 
government position in the capital two days earlier, U.N. officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting, which shattered a truce declared for the visit of a senior U.N. 
envoy, again prevented relief supplies from being flown into the capital, and 
the U.N. officials expressed fears that shortages of food and medicine had 
become critical. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the mortar rounds, apparently fired by rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, hit a Red Cross hospital in the government-controlled section of Kigali, 
killing two Rwandan nurses, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels also pounded army positions near the Defense Ministry, while the army 
lobbed shell after shell on rebel forces on the outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Tutsi-dominated rebels -- who say they are fighting a war of 
liberation against the predominantly Hutu government -- had mounted a 
three-pronged attack and captured the Kanombe army camp overlooking the 
airport. The three battalions of defenders fled, and some diplomatic observers 
in Nairobi believed that the rebels would soon win the battle for Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other African wars -- in Liberia, Angola and Somalia, for example -- 
armies that may have wilted in the countryside have been willing to fight 
fiercely to defend their capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is particularly clear in Rwanda: The government, the military, 
communications and transportation facilities are centralized in the capital; 
without the capital, the government would have little left worth fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting Wednesday further delayed the arrival of a 5,500-member, 
all-African peacekeeping force under U.N. command. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations' special envoy, Iqbal Riza, is in Kigali trying to persuade 
both sides to allow deployment of the troops and the United Nations to take 
control of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riza's talks may be premature because only three African nations -- 
Ethiopia, Ghana and Senegal -- have agreed to participate in the force. Their 
commitment totals 2,200 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Riza traveled in an armored vehicle through the fighting on the western edge 
of the city to the seat of the interim government in Gitarama, 25 miles 
southwest of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press reported that he hoped to hold talks today with the 
rebels in Mulindi, a rebel stronghold just south of the Ugandan border. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats in East Africa are not optimistic about the chances for a 
lasting, negotiated political settlement, because rebel commanders appear to 
want nothing less than a military victory that will put them in position to 
bargain for a large share of power, even though the Tutsis are 9% of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, most moderate government officials who favored conciliation 
between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis have been killed, and the 
surviving officials now at Gitarama represent the extremist wing. 
</P>
<P>
 This element appears to support the eradication of the Tutsis and is widely 
believed to be responsible for the widespread massacres that have claimed the 
lives of at least 200,000 Rwandans, most of them Tutsis, since April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting is slowly turning Kigali into a ghost town and is depopulating 
the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations has set up 15 camps in neighboring Tanzania, Uganda and 
Zaire for the estimated 2 million Rwandans who are now homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 In Benaco, a Tanzanian refugee camp that holds 300,000 Rwandans, Red Cross 
workers Wednesday reported the first six cases of meningitis, an easily spread 
bacterial disease that can be deadly.

RUSSIAN SAVORS IRONIES OF MEETING WITH PERRY AT NATO HEADQUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia's Pavel S. Grachev was the perfect host Wednesday as he opened a 
meeting here with U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry. The irony of the 
situation only seemed to buoy his mood even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems strange to me that I'm welcoming you here to this building today," 
the Russian defense minister told his American counterpart, smirking at the 
circumstances. Perry too broke into a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 The session over which Grachev was presiding was being held in Conference Room 
No. 2 at NATO headquarters here, and the sign outside announced "Russia" -- for 
the Russian delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev, a four-star general who made 634 parachute jumps while he was an 
officer in the former Soviet army, was taking the biggest leap of his career: 
He was here to sign Russia up for NATO -- as a sort of associate member for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Russians were not the only military officials from the former 
East Bloc to rate their own suite at the NATO ministerial meeting here this 
week. The broad, heavily carpeted concourse that leads to NATO's main meeting 
chamber was dotted with the oversized military caps of officers from 18 other 
onetime Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been a meeting of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact, joked a local 
wag. 
</P>
<P>
 The session, which followed a meeting of NATO defense ministers on Tuesday, 
marked the first meeting of the Partnership for Peace, a kind of auxiliary 
program that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has set up for former East 
Bloc countries. And for all of the joking, it was one of those days on which 
even the most seasoned diplomats and military officers were overcome by the 
sense that they were witnessing an important piece of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone is sort of awed by it all," mused a U.S. officer who has 
spent his career trying to prepare for a possible confrontation with Soviet 
forces. "I thought I'd never see this come." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Russians will not actually join the PfP, as it is becoming 
known here, until sometime in early June, when Moscow presents its final 
application at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Istanbul, Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grachev was here this week to present formally Russia's preliminary 
proposal for its terms of membership -- ending weeks of hot-and-cold statements 
from Moscow about whether the Kremlin would or would not sign up. 
</P>
<P>
 And, to the relief of Western diplomats here, he was unambiguous about reports 
that the Russians would insist on special conditions: "Absolutely nyet ," he 
told reporters at the opening of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 A mood of optimism lasted all day Wednesday. After the morning session, the 
NATO ministers, Grachev and the defense chiefs of the 18 Partnership for Peace 
member countries posed for what was deliberately dubbed a "family portrait." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ukraine's defense minister, Vitaly Radetsky, who was scheduled to meet 
with Perry after the session with Grachev, refused to take offense when the 
American was late. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll make up for it tonight," he said lightheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The ironies continued into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of bilateral meetings here in Brussels, Perry and the other 
ministers flew by helicopter to the Belgian city of Mons for a tour of the new 
building at the allies' European headquarters that will serve as a military 
center for Partnership for Peace countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, which was completed in 1990, originally was built as an 
evacuation center in case Western Europe were invaded by the Soviet Bloc. A 
chunk of the fallen Berlin Wall now serves as statuary at its entrance.

RUSSIA SEEKS WIDER ACCORD WITH NATO; MILITARY: MOSCOW'S DEFENSE MINISTER 
PRESENTS THE PROPOSAL IN BRUSSELS. IT WOULD GO BEYOND THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia on Wednesday proposed beginning broad talks with NATO on a wide range 
of issues, from nuclear proliferation to the environment -- beyond its latest 
decision to join the Partnership for Peace program. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, unveiled at a NATO-sponsored meeting by Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel S. Grachev, appeared to be aimed partly at domestic consumption, to show 
hard-liners at home that Russia is still holding its own in dealing with the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev did not make his proposal a condition for Russia's joining the 
Partnership for Peace program, which was set up by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization five months ago to provide an opportunity for closer links with 
former East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians, who submitted their preliminary application for the program 
Tuesday, are expected to join formally as early as June, at a meeting of NATO 
foreign ministers scheduled to be held in Istanbul, Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Western response to Grachev was lukewarm at best. Although the 
NATO defense ministers seemed relieved that Russia had not set conditions for 
its entry into the program, they seemed cool to the notion of broader talks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry, asked about the plan at a news 
conference later, said only that what Grachev is proposing is "set up along 
different parameters" than the Partnership for Peace program. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment on the substance of the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Western officials said they still are not sure how NATO would respond to the 
proposal. Besides proliferation and the environment, Grachev listed defense 
conversion and disarmament as possible topics in any broader talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's session marked the first time that the NATO defense ministers and 
their counterparts from countries in the Partnership for Peace program have met 
as a group. So far, 18 governments, representing East European and ex-Soviet 
countries, have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, noting that for most of its existence the alliance had been devoted to 
defending the West against the now-defunct Warsaw Pact, called a NATO session 
held Tuesday "a major step in removing the dividing line between East and 
West." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russia submitted its initial "protocol" Tuesday, Western defense 
ministers seemed encouraged that Grachev himself attended the entire meeting 
here. The group later went to Mons, Belgium, to tour a new Partnership for 
Peace center there. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, Western officials had feared that Russia might seek some sort 
of special status as a condition for joining the program -- leading to worries 
among some East Europeans that it was trying to dominate the group. But Grachev 
made it clear Wednesday that Moscow would not press such demands as a condition 
for membership in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not setting any preconditions for joining," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He also announced that as part of its new role in the Partnership for Peace 
program, Russia would be willing to join NATO forces in a wide variety of 
operations, from peacekeeping duties to joint military exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 In that connection, the United States and Russia announced Tuesday that they 
will go ahead with previous plans to hold joint military exercises this summer, 
despite indications earlier that they might be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 In outlining his proposal for broader consultations between Russia and NATO, 
Grachev argued that existing talks are proving inadequate for the job, and that 
Russia and the West need a new vehicle for widening their current agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 While praising the Partnership for Peace program as a "first step" in bringing 
the two sides closer, he said it is "not the complete answer to the reality of 
the new epoch." 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is prepared for the creation of a real and full strategic partnership 
with NATO," Grachev declared. He called his plan "a practical step on the road 
to the formation of a system of collective security." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Grachev's proposal for broader talks was not likely to upset existing 
Western diplomatic machinery, analysts said it has the potential to turn NATO 
into a political forum well beyond its historic role as a military alliance.

RUSSIA GANGS COULD STEAL A-ARMS, FBI CHIEF SAYS

 Russian organized crime groups are spreading in the United States and Europe 
and "may already have the capability to steal nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons 
components or weapons-grade nuclear materials," FBI Director Louis J. Freeh 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Freeh emphasized in his remarks to the permanent investigations panel of 
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that so far there have been "no 
serious diversions of weapons-grade nuclear materials." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh announced that because organized crime has become so great a concern in 
the former Soviet Union, he will travel to Eastern Europe and Russia next month 
to get a better picture of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh also announced that on the trip he would open the FBI's first permanent 
office in Moscow. The FBI currently has agents known as legal attaches 
stationed in a number of world capitals but has never had any permanently 
stationed in Russia or the former Soviet Union.

MANDELA CONSIDERS AFRIKANER HOMELAND

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to ease tensions with right-wing opponents, President Nelson 
Mandela called Wednesday for negotiations on setting up a white-dominated 
region. He said he will consider an amnesty for white extremists, including 
those accused of bombings that killed 21 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, the nation's first black president, met separately with right-wing 
leaders Ferdi Hartzenberg and retired army Gen. Constand Viljoen in an effort 
to keep channels open with whites opposed to black rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela said his government will begin talks with right-wing leaders seeking a 
homeland for Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended white settlers of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartenzberg had sought an independent, whites-only state, an idea ruled out by 
Mandela's African National Congress. But after meeting with Mandela, he seemed 
to give up that goal in return for assurances that talks would begin on a 
white-ruled region within South Africa.

CLINTON TAKES OFFENSIVE ON BOSNIA, ASSAILS CRITICS' 'SIMPLISTIC IDEAS'; POLICY: 
PRESIDENT SAYS THAT UNILATERALLY LIFTING ARMS EMBARGO 'WOULD KILL THE PEACE 
PROCESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton used commencement at the Naval Academy on Wednesday as a 
platform for a sharp counterattack on critics of his Bosnia policy -- including 
many leaders of his own party -- accusing them of advancing "simplistic ideas 
that sound good on bumper stickers but that would have tragic consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's policy, which relies heavily on multinational 
consultations and which critics deride as a failure to assert U.S. leadership, 
"is not quick; it is not neat; it is not comfortable," Clinton conceded. "But I 
am convinced, in a world of interdependence where we must lead by working with 
others, it is the right path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Administration will not walk away from this Bosnian conflict. But we will 
not embrace solutions that are wrong," the President said. "We plan to continue 
the course we have chosen -- raising the price on those who pursue aggression, 
helping to provide relief to the suffering and working with our partners in 
Europe to move the parties to a workable agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Clinton denounced proposals that the United States unilaterally 
violate the U.N. embargo against arms shipments to the warring parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a course that many Democrats have endorsed and that has 
substantial congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton has made that point several times before, his sharpened 
rhetoric marked an escalation of the war of words over Bosnia policy. The move 
reflects a realization by White House officials that Clinton needs to take a 
more active role in defending his foreign policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also repeated his insistence that Congress not make further cuts in 
the defense budget, an idea that congressional liberals have revived as 
lawmakers begin to face the hard choices on spending forced on them this year 
by tight budget caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the President's sometimes strained relations with the military, the 
Naval Academy graduates accorded Clinton and his speech polite applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also defended his overall approach of emphasizing multilateral action 
in most foreign arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics, including several potential Republican presidential hopefuls, say 
that he has devalued traditional U.S. leadership by refusing to act alone when 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Clinton said, while the United States must act unilaterally when its own 
immediate interests are at stake, many world crises require international 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end of the superpower standoff lifted the lid from a caldron of 
long-simmering hatreds," he said. "Now the entire global terrain is bloody with 
such conflicts, from Rwanda to Georgia (in the former Soviet Union). 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot solve every such outburst of civil strife or militant nationalism 
simply by sending in our forces. We cannot turn away from them. But our 
interests are not sufficiently at stake in so many of them to justify a 
commitment of our folks." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, for example, the United States has interests at stake, Clinton 
said. They are not weighty enough to "warrant our unilateral involvement, but 
they do demand that we help to lead a way to a workable peace agreement if one 
can be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Clinton advisers shied away from having the President defend 
his positions on foreign issues, believing that the public would resent it if 
he spent time on overseas issues rather than on domestic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration's mood on that issue has shifted recently as polls have 
shown that public uncertainty about Clinton's foreign policies has begun 
dragging down voters' overall assessment of his ability. 
</P>
<P>
 The arms embargo has been a particularly difficult issue for the White House 
because Clinton agrees with critics who say that the main impact of the embargo 
has been to prevent the Muslim-led Bosnian government's forces from obtaining 
enough weapons to defend themselves against Bosnian Serb rebels who receive 
arms through the neighboring republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's inability to persuade Britain, France and Russia -- each 
of which has a veto in the U.N. Security Council -- to lift the embargo has led 
members of both parties to call on Clinton to violate the ban unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue has split both parties. The Senate, with the support of 13 
Democrats, passed a measure earlier this month calling for lifting the embargo 
unilaterally. But earlier the same day it had approved another measure saying 
that the action should be taken only in consultation with allies. House 
leaders, facing similarly split sentiment, have been grappling with the issue 
as well but have postponed any votes until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that unilaterally lifting the embargo "would kill the peace 
process; it would sour our relationships with our European allies . . . and in 
the U.N. . . . it would undermine our efforts to enforce U.N. embargoes that we 
like such as those against (Iraqi dictator) Saddam Hussein, (Libyan dictator) 
Col. (Moammar) Kadafi and (Lt.) Gen. (Raoul) Cedras in Haiti."

 Pentagon officials have been concealing or ignoring evidence that tens of 
thousands of U.S. Persian Gulf War veterans were exposed to Iraqi chemical and 
biological weapons during the conflict, a Senate report released Wednesday 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing 
and Urban Affairs Committee, which interviewed more than 600 veterans in 
preparing its report, demanded that the Pentagon declassify all information 
relating to the detection of chemical and biological agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Riegle recalled the Pentagon's reluctance to release information on Agent 
Orange after the Vietnam War and raised doubts about the effectiveness of 
devices used in the field to detect the presence of chemical agents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Persian Gulf War veterans Wednesday, Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, said, "There is no information, classified or unclassified, that 
indicates that chemical or biological weapons were used in the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
 But veterans' testimony in the Senate report suggests that chemical and 
biological contamination was widespread. Operation Desert Storm soldiers 
described 10 incidents of Iraqi rocket attacks that released noxious fumes or 
set off chemical agent alarms, as well as several encounters with irritating 
chemicals in the air. About 12,000 veterans have reported symptoms ranging from 
skin irritation to memory loss, claiming that they are victims of "Gulf War 
Syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 In one incident, eyewitnesses recounted their experiences during the early 
hours of Jan. 19, 1991, when an explosion near the port of Jubayl in Saudi 
Arabia sent U.S. troops in a naval construction battalion scurrying for cover. 
When soldiers emerged from their bomb shelter, some reported a numbness or a 
burning sensation on their skin. One soldier who tested the area for chemical 
agents that evening reported that two of three tests had positive readings. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing of Riegle's committee Wednesday, Pentagon officials said Iraq did 
not deploy chemical or biological toxins, even though hundreds of chemical 
alarms were triggered during the war. In some cases, the sensors may have 
malfunctioned, the officials said, and in others the alarms were discounted 
after further review. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Undersecretary Edwin Dorn said there is some concern, however, about 
the possibility that soldiers could have been exposed to low levels of chemical 
warfare agents or fallout in Kuwait and southern Iraq as a result of Allied 
bombing of Iraqi military installations. 
</P>
<P>
 Riegle accused the Pentagon of concealing or suppressing reports of toxic 
exposures during the conflict, saying the military Establishment has an 
"institutional difficulty in coming to terms with grievous decision errors. . . 
. I've seen our government lie to us before in other war situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Army chemical data included in the Senate report indicates that U.S. chemical 
detectors may not have been sensitive enough to register very low levels of 
certain agents, such as the nerve gas sarin, which can still be harmful if 
soldiers are exposed to it over long periods. Last July, the Czech minister of 
defense announced that a chemical decontamination unit from his country had 
detected low levels of sarin in Saudi Arabia early in the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms commonly associated with sarin include respiratory problems and chest 
pain, which many veterans reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorn acknowledged that physicians have been unable to diagnose symptoms of at 
least 2,000 veterans, many of whom claim to have Gulf War Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the fear and the frustration that many veterans are 
experiencing," Dorn said. "They are sick, and their doctors can't offer 
definitive answers." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who has suffered since the war is Dean V. Lundholm Jr. of Live 
Oak, Calif., who served with an Army National Guard unit. Since returning from 
Saudi Arabia in 1991, Lundholm has been so beset by respiratory and digestive 
problems that he has been unable to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I served my country willingly and proudly," said Lundholm, who founded the 
California Assn. of Persian Gulf Veterans, at a National Institutes of Health 
hearing last month. "But I now expect my country to treat me and other war vets 
with respect and concern. And that means we vets should get information, 
diagnosis and treatment about our health status." Copies of Lundholm's 
testimony were distributed at Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Pentagon has also considered the possibility that experimental 
vaccines administered to soldiers to combat chemical weapon attacks may have 
led to some veterans' symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of experts led by Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg is re-examining 
evidence of chemical weapon exposure for the Defense Department and is expected 
to report its findings next month, Dorn said.

 Retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who headed U.S. forces during the Persian 
Gulf War, underwent surgery for prostate cancer Wednesday at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "All indications are that the cancer was discovered in its early stages, and 
the prospects are for a full recovery," the hospital said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David McLeod, chief of urology at Walter Reed, said Schwarzkopf was in 
excellent physical condition and should recover fully in a matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer affecting men, with 
an estimated 165,000 new cases in 1993. It occurs in the prostate gland, 
located at the base of the bladder.

 Departing flights were delayed for nearly two hours Wednesday at airports 
across the Northwest when a bomb threat prompted the evacuation of the region's 
air traffic control center. 
</P>
<P>
 A Federal Aviation Administration center in Auburn, south of Seattle, received 
the telephone threat at 8:05 a.m., FAA spokesman Dick Meyer said. The caller 
indicated that a bomb was in the building, but none was found. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people were evacuated during the search. A few controllers 
stayed to direct planes in the air, Meyer said.

EX-UC BERKELEY CHIEF TO HEAD SMITHSONIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ira Michael Heyman, a lawyer and former chancellor of UC Berkeley, was named 
Wednesday to the post of secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the first time in the 148-year history of the institution that a 
non-scientist was chosen as the chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote of the Smithsonian's 17-member board of regents "finally was 
unanimous," said Barber Conable, head of the search committee. He declined to 
name competing finalists, but a Smithsonian employee said Thomas Lovejoy, 
assistant secretary of the institution, had supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyman, now counselor to the Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, succeeds 
anthropologist Robert McC. Adams, who has been secretary for 10 years. Adams 
has said he wants to return to research. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyman's experience as chancellor of UC Berkeley from 1980 to 1990 -- a job 
that requires skill at fund raising -- was a factor in his choice.

MINORS HAVE EASY ACCESS TO CIGARETTES, STATE STUDY FINDS; SMOKING: OF ABOUT 
2,000 STORES, MORE THAN HALF WERE WILLING TO SELL TOBACCO TO UNDERAGE 
TEEN-AGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A statewide survey of nearly 2,000 stores by the Department of Health Services 
found that more than half were willing to sell cigarettes to underage 
teen-agers without asking for proof of age, underscoring the need for tough new 
legislation, the agency's director said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This survey confirms that cigarettes and chewing tobacco are readily 
available to children everywhere, despite an existing law that prohibits the 
sale of cigarettes and chewing tobacco to minors under 18," department Director 
Kim Belshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents, community leaders and lawmakers who think children can't buy 
cigarettes because they are underage need to think again. The survey findings 
are simply unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Minors who volunteered for the survey tried to buy cigarettes in 124 
communities in 25 counties throughout the state, including 14 cities in Los 
Angeles County. Retail outlets included supermarkets, chain drug stores, 
mom-and-pop grocery stores, gasoline/convenience stores, restaurants and liquor 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,959 stores visited, 53% agreed to sell cigarettes to the minors 
without verifying their age. As part of the study, the teen-agers stopped the 
sales before they were completed. The intent of the survey was research, not to 
break the law, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California has had a law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to 
minors for 104 years, there has been very little enforcement. Fines range from 
$200 to $1,000. Minors who receive tobacco products are subject to a $50 fine 
or 25 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers have measures aimed at cracking down on the illegal sale of 
cigarettes to minors, including Sens. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and Assemblywoman Valerie Brown (D-Sonoma), who 
wants to increase fines on retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Lung Assn. said Wednesday that it wants a law banning cigarette 
vending machines, which are easily accessible to minors. The survey found that 
at 85% of the cigarette vending machines visited, no attempt was made by a 
clerk or an adult to stop the teen-agers from purchasing cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said a vending machine ban is not likely to pass. She said her 
measure already faces strong opposition from the tobacco industry without also 
trying to ban the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The lung association also called for other remedies, such as state licensing 
of tobacco retailers to permit administrative penalties; requiring posted 
warnings stating it is illegal to sell cigarettes to minors; mandating age 
verification; outlawing free samples of tobacco products, and establishing a 
toll-free telephone number for reporting merchant violations. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, Belshe said a recently enacted federal law requires states 
to document a reduction in tobacco sales to minors or risk losing federal drug 
and alcohol abuse grants, which could cost California $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no meaningful decline in smoking by teen-agers since 1990, 
although adult smoking has decreased by 28% in the same period, Belshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Robbins of the lung association said cigarette makers are targeting 
minors. "You've got to get more young people to start smoking if you want to 
sell more cigarettes, so the focus is on youth," he said. "There is too much 
easy access to tobacco products by minors." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the teen-agers said they were shocked to find out how easy it was to buy 
cigarettes. Alma Lopez, 17, of Los Angeles said she went to 14 stores and was 
turned down only once. "The most difficult question was what kind (of 
cigarettes) do you want?" Lopez said at a Capitol news conference.

NEW CONCERT DATE POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although no formal decision is expected until this afternoon, organizers 
expect that Barbra Streisand will reschedule her canceled concert at The Pond 
of Anaheim. People with tickets are being asked to retain them for use on a 
date to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems unlikely that the show, or any other shows Streisand may cancel here, 
would be moved to the off nights in her Anaheim schedule (She is scheduled to 
perform Friday and every other night after that through June 4). Sources close 
to the singer say she scheduled her tour specifically so to avoid working on 
consecutive nights and that it is extremely unlikely that she would alter that 
plan, especially given her throat condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A possible scenario: Streisand would return for any make-up dates after 
appearances June 7 and 9 at the San Jose Arena, her next stop on the tour. She 
has no concerts planned between the San Jose shows and a five-night stand 
beginning June 20 at Madison Square Garden in New York, her final stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the elaborate stage set to San Jose and back to Anaheim would add 
considerable expense to the production, according to Streisand's publicist, 
Dick Guttman. But there may be no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, people who bought their tickets through brokers shouldn't worry, at 
least according to two ticket dealers in Orange County. Any refunds will be 
made in full, and not just for the face value of the ticket, according to 
spokesmen for the Box Office Ticket Service in Fullerton and Executive Tickets 
in Irvine.

STREISAND'S RANGE, AMPLITUDE MAY BE LIMITED; HEALTH: LAGUNA HILLS DOCTOR 
SPECULATES THAT LARYNGITIS COULD CAUSE SINGER'S VOICE TO BREAK, FAIL TO REACH 
NOTES. HE SAYS REST IS THE BEST TREATMENT.

 An ear, nose and throat specialist in Laguna Hills said Wednesday that asking 
Barbra Streisand to sing with viral tracheal laryngitis would be like asking an 
injured runner to enter a race. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could talk, she may be able to sing, but she's a true vocal athlete; her 
range will be affected, and her amplitude,' said Dr. Lee Hartman."She may not 
reach notes she wants to, or her voice may break. It just wouldn't be her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make the analogy of a runner with a mild leg injury. You may not see him 
limp, but if you put him in a race, his time performance would be altered." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that he doesn't "even know the woman," the doctor offered an 
explanation of what forced Streisand to cancel her opening concert here. Viral 
tracheal laryngitis "simply means an inflammation of the larynx, or voice box, 
and the trachea, or windpipe," he said from his office at Saddleback Memorial 
Medical Center in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Permanent injury," even scarring, could result if Streisand forces herself to 
sing while ill, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment? 
</P>
<P>
 "Voice rest," and occasional medication to reduce swelling. 
</P>
<P>
 And how long can it last? 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is viral, "it may be anywhere from a few days to several weeks." *

JACKSON INVITES WILSON, UNZ TO SQUARE OFF IN RADIO DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Radio talk show host Michael Jackson began Wednesday's debate by asking for 
another before the June 7 primary: between Gov. Pete Wilson and his Republican 
challenger, physicist Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Wilson, this is your formal invitation," said Jackson, who hosts a 
daytime talk show on KABC-AM (790).Later, he repeated his offer to make time 
for such an exchange of views: "I repeat, governor, I'll cancel anything we're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Unz campaign, which was listening to the discussion and has repeatedly 
sought a debate with Wilson, immediately accepted Jackson's invitation via fax. 
Dan Schnur, Wilson's spokesman, said he was attempting to reach the governor in 
Washington to get an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson wasn't the only one to call for more debates. During Wednesday's back 
and forth, state Sen. Tom Hayden prompted applause when he turned to his fellow 
Democrats and asked: "Since we have not discussed the environment, have not 
discussed women, have not discussed race, could we have more debates?" 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi immediately agreed, prompting this 
retort from state Treasurer Kathleen Brown: "Ron Unz is a lot closer to Pete 
Wilson in the polls than you are to me, so I think that we need to hear who I 
might be running against in November."

PAROLE REJECTED FOR RAY IN KING ASSASSINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Earl Ray lost his bid for freedom Wednesday when a parole board rejected 
claims that he did not kill Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and that he was 
pressured into pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 At his first parole hearing in 25 years, Ray claimed his lawyer convinced him 
that he already had been convicted by the news media and that pleading guilty 
in return for 99 years in prison was better than risking a trial and possible 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I didn't kill Dr. King," Ray said. "I wasn't involved in any type of 
collusive activity." 
</P>
<P>
 King was slain on April 4, 1968, as he stood on a motel balcony in Memphis, 
where he had come to back striking sanitation workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a choice," Tennessee Board of Paroles member Rose Hill said of the 
plea. "I did not have a choice," Ray replied. 
</P>
<P>
 King's slaying sparked riots in more than 100 cities and set off one of the 
largest searches in U.S. history before Ray was captured in London. Ray was 
returned to Memphis, where he pleaded guilty. Three days later, he recanted.

BANK ERROR MAKES FLORIDA MAN MILLIONAIRE FOR A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard Jenkins had fun as a multimillionaire, even making a $4-million 
withdrawal during his lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Because it was there, after a bank's computer error put $88 million in his 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins' brief stint as a rich man started when he lost his checkbook. He 
called NationsBank and put a temporary hold on the account. When he went to 
make a deposit last Friday, he was told to check the automated teller machine 
outside to make sure the account was active again. 
</P>
<P>
 When he withdrew $10, the receipt said Jenkins' balance was $889,437. 
Incredulous, Jenkins went home and called the bank's telephone system and got 
even better news. A computerized voice told him his account topped $88 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins returned to the bank and asked a teller for his balance. When she 
wrote eight digits on a piece of paper and slid it to him, "I almost fainted," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said: 'Did you get an inheritance or something?' " Jenkins said. "I said: 
'Or something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to ask for a $4-million withdrawal. "They handed me $4 million and 
didn't bat an eye," said Jenkins, 31, the promotional manager for a roofing 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up his girlfriend for lunch and showed her the money: $3,000 in cash 
and seven checks, one for $997,000 and the rest for $500,000 each. "Her first 
reaction was 'Where are we going?' Her second reaction was 'You know we can't 
keep this,' " Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, he went back to the bank with his lawyer -- to make sure the 
bank didn't try to arrest him -- and "handed them back every penny they gave 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Sink, president of NationsBank of Florida, chalked it up to a computer 
error.

CLINTON URGES DEMOCRATS TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH BILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton made the rounds of Capitol Hill on Wednesday to promote his 
health care agenda, offering a spoonful of conciliatory honey to Republican 
senators whose support he hopes to win and following it with a dash of 
combative vinegar to stiffen the resolve of Democratic House members. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, accompanied by a phalanx of top Administration officials, conducted 
the series of closed meetings as a send-off for Congress as it prepares to 
adjourn for its Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats in particular, the weeklong break could be a time of intense 
pressure from constituents and interest groups at home. Clinton's health care 
plan is encountering difficulties in all five congressional committees 
considering it. Democrats are also nursing their wounds from a special election 
in Kentucky -- hailed by Republicans as a referendum on Clinton's policies -- 
that saw one congressional district fall into GOP hands for the first time in 
more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton left a session with House and Senate Democratic leaders -- the 
first of three with various groups in Congress in his three hours on Capitol 
Hill -- he said his health care bill is "something we very much want to do in a 
bipartisan fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of the third meeting, which was a pep rally for the entire 
Democratic membership of the House, it was clear that Clinton was in a more 
confrontational mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President told us something that was important for us to hear: If we 
really want to accomplish something, we've got to fight for it," said Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who is one of Clinton's chief House allies in 
the health care battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), another subcommittee chairman with jurisdiction 
over health, said: "He used the word 'fight' half a dozen times." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the closed sessions included any Republican participants -- and it 
was the idea of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to invite 
them. However, Democrats and Republicans alike said Clinton had been solicitous 
at the session and eager to hear the views of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans said they told Clinton bluntly that the linchpin of his plan -- a 
requirement that employers pay for their workers' health coverage -- will not 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Mr. President, I support mandates. I will support mandates, but 
I think if this bill has mandates, it loses,' " Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) 
said. Packwood is the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which 
is considered difficult territory for Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more positive note for the Administration, a second House subcommittee 
managed to approve a version of the Clinton plan shortly before the President 
arrived on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Education and Labor Committee's labor-management relations 
subcommittee chaired by Williams voted, 17 to 10, in favor of the plan. It 
passed strictly along party lines, without a single GOP vote in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill contains the basic elements of the Clinton plan but substitutes 
voluntary purchasing cooperatives for mandatory health alliances. It also 
contains more generous benefits in such areas as women's health, mental health 
and dental care, and increases subsidies to help small businesses afford their 
workers' coverage.

SURVEY FINDS SHARP DROP IN EMPLOYER-PAID INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The percentage of Americans with employer-paid medical insurance has dropped 
sharply in 10 years and the trend is accelerating, the Clinton Administration 
said Wednesday, as it released new Census Bureau data sure to fuel the health 
care reform debate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the bureau's employee benefits survey of 30,000 workers, only 61% 
had employer-provided medical coverage, down from 66% in 1983. The rate of 
decline was steeper among workers at large companies than those at small firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a stable system. Employers are providing less and less," Labor 
Secretary Robert B. Reich said at a Capitol Hill press conference. "All workers 
are vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Such rapid erosion "makes a very strong case for strengthening the 
employer-based system," he declared. "It is time for all employers to share in 
this burden." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents used the same data to argue for solutions other than President 
Clinton's proposal to force all employers to provide insurance to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given those trends, is the employer mandate realistic? Can't we try some 
other means to encourage employers to provide benefits?" asked Sharon Canner, a 
National Assn. of Manufacturers analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Census data showed that since 1979 coverage has declined from 83% to 73% 
of the work force at firms with 100 or more workers. Over the same period, 
coverage declined from 60% to 54% at firms with fewer than 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is across the board. This is not solely a small-firm phenomenon," Reich 
said. "If anything, large firms are beginning to get out of the health care 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the data represent "the most comprehensive view that we've had yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The President has defended the employer mandate -- the most controversial 
element of his reform agenda -- as a conservative approach that builds on the 
existing system, noting that the overwhelming majority of privately insured 
Americans get their coverage through the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve his goal of universal coverage, Clinton would require all employers 
to pay at least 80% of a full-time worker's premiums, up to a cap of 7.9% of 
total payroll. Small firms with low average payrolls would receive government 
subsidies, reducing their "contribution" to as little as 3.5% of payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's bill also would require individual workers to pay up to 20% of 
their premiums, or no more than 3.9% of their wages. 
</P>
<P>
 But many big and small businesses, as well as most congressional Republicans 
and even some Democrats, strongly oppose any mandate. So any significant health 
care reform will require major compromises on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of mandates, such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Assn. 
of Manufacturers, prefer voluntary incentives and a gradual extension of 
coverage to the estimated 38 million uninsured Americans. Like Clinton, 
however, they support malpractice reforms, administrative simplification to 
reduce costly red tape and insurance market reforms that ban discriminatory 
practices against small groups, particularly people with pre-existing 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 At his press conference, Reich rebutted questions that challenged the wisdom 
of building upon a system that even the Administration says is in rapid 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still a health care system that is premised upon employer 
contributions," Reich said. That system may be "ailing," he conceded, but it 
remains "the bedrock of America's health care system."

DEMOCRAT HOPEFULS TOLD TO RUN ON CLINTON RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm on Wednesday denounced 
Democratic candidates, including the loser in this week's special House 
election in Kentucky, for not running on President Clinton's record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson here is that Democrats should run as Democrats," Wilhelm said, 
speaking of the loss Tuesday of a House seat in Kentucky held by Democrats for 
129 years. The defeat spurred increased concern among Democrats and enthusiasm 
in Republican circles about prospects in the fall elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The election results and Wilhelm's criticism underlined a problem that 
Democratic congressional candidates will face in November as a result of their 
party's conquest of the White House in 1992. During the 12 years of the Ronald 
Reagan-George Bush presidencies, Democratic candidates could tailor their 
campaigns to suit local tastes with minimal concern about the national party. 
</P>
<P>
 But now they have to answer for Clinton's policies, too, and this could be a 
heavy burden, especially in the South and other conservative areas where 
neither the President nor his policies are popular. 
</P>
<P>
 In off-year elections, the party controlling the White House traditionally 
loses seats in the House, where Democrats hold a 256-178 majority. But 
professionals in both parties said circumstances of the Kentucky contest 
suggest that House Democrats this year face a particular difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to their burden is the gradual but steady realignment of the South's 
congressional districts, which have long been dominated by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The special election to replace the late Rep. William H. Natcher was won by 
Republican Ron Lewis, a minister and fundamentalist-bookstore owner who 
received 55% of the vote to 45% for Democrat Joe Prather, a former state 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 A distant underdog at the start of the campaign, Lewis benefited from an 
infusion of campaign funds and advice from the national party and from a 
zealous organizing effort by conservative Christians. He centered his campaign 
on linking Prather to Clinton, even running a commercial that depicted 
Clinton's face blending into Prather's. 
</P>
<P>
 In a district Bush carried in 1992, Prather concluded that he should keep his 
distance from Clinton and from the national party, refusing financial support 
or any other type of help. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm contended that Lewis and other Democrats would be better off running 
on the President's record. They should be "proud of deficit reduction, proud of 
(creating) 3 million jobs," and should not "pretend as if you were in a 
different party or your President was somebody else," he said. But some 
independent analysts and Democratic consultants rejected Wilhelm's argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the President is not seen as an asset" in many Southern districts, 
said Merle Black, Emory University specialist on Southern politics. Democratic 
candidates in those districts "are stuck with Clinton and he has given them an 
unpopular agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Black suggested that, instead of trying to defend Clinton's policies, 
Democratic candidates should stress the practical advantages they could offer 
their constituents because a President of their party controls the executive 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt about it that in parts of the South it's just very hard 
right now to run stride for stride with Clinton," said Saul Shorr, a Democratic 
consultant for half a dozen Democratic House candidates in the South. "It's 
going to be a tough year for Democrats."

FROZEN CHICKEN WARS HEAT UP; POULTRY: HOW COLD IS FROZEN? CALIFORNIA AND 
FEDERAL CHICKEN PRODUCERS CAN'T AGREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A war of words will have to suffice while California chicken producers await 
their day in federal court in a long-running campaign to remove the word 
"fresh" from labels on out-of-state chickens that have been allegedly frozen, 
thawed and then placed in local meat counters as if shipped right from the 
nearest San Joaquin Valley coop. 
</P>
<P>
 Cries of "fraud" and "unscrupulous" have been used by California producers to 
describe what they call the frozen-thaw-fresh practice employed by some 
producers in the Southeastern United States who they say ship rock-hard 
broilers to the California market, the nation's largest.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety percent of our product is sold fresh or refrigerated to 28 degrees," 
said Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Industry Federation. "The 
other producing states want to ship their broilers at any temperature above 
zero degrees. So product coming into this state can be chilled to zero, thawed 
and sold as fresh. In our opinion, that isn't fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Kushner, attorney with Hogan & Hartson in Washington, who represents 
national poultry trade groups insists that broilers raised in the Southeastern 
United States and shipped to California "are not frozen." 
</P>
<P>
 "The average temperature (Southeastern producers) try to maintain during 
transport is closer to the mid-20s then below that," he said. "There is no need 
to bring (poultry) product to very low temperatures because it only increases 
the producers' energy and storage costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner said he doesn't know the average temperature of Southeastern-raised 
broilers by the time they reach California outlets. But regardless of possible 
temperature fluctuations in transit, he said that according to the federal 
Poultry Products Inspection Act, a chicken is legally considered fresh as long 
as it isn't chilled below zero degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists consider the freezing point for chicken is between 28 degrees and 
29 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever the temperature (on a bird's carcass) reaches 28 degrees," said 
Glenn W. Froning Ph.D., a food science professor at the University of Nebraska 
at Lincoln, "that area would be considered frozen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The feud is unusual in the food industry, particularly within the confines of 
a single commodity group such as chicken, because regional interests are 
normally loath to criticize other producers for fear that the sniping may taint 
the image of everyone's product. 
</P>
<P>
 Poultry producers are particularly unlikely candidates for a quarrel because 
the industry normally presents a united front to weather increasing attacks 
from consumer advocates and Congress about high levels of contamination in 
uncooked chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "do not fault one's chicken colleague" credo has cracked. Now it's 
pretty much California against the rest of the chicken world. The chief 
adversaries are Arkansas and Georgia, the nation's top two producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most California broiler production is sold within the state, which has the 
nation's highest per-capita rate of chicken consumption -- 80 pounds per person 
vs. the U.S. average of 73 pounds. At stake is about $4 billion in fresh 
broiler sales in the state; about half those sales go to California producers. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict dates back to 1988 but heated up last June when state Sen. Dan 
McCorquodale (D-Modesto) introduced a bill that would prohibit previously 
frozen chicken -- defined in the bill as any bird held at 25 degrees or less 
for a period of 24 hours or more -- from being labeled "fresh." The state 
Senate and Assembly unanimously passed the bill and it was signed into law by 
Gov. Pete Wilson last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the Arkansas Poultry Federation, the National Broiler 
Council and the American Meat Institute filed suit in U.S. District Court to 
overturn the law; they claimed it was preempted by the federal Poultry Products 
Inspection Act.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal Judge David Levi agreed with the three trade groups and ruled against 
California in December. 
</P>
<P>
 California producers appealed and were granted an expedited hearing in front 
of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. It's expected the case 
will be scheduled some time next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent behind the California law was simply to protect local markets," 
said Kushner, who represented the three trade groups. "I seriously doubt it was 
intended to protect California consumers from 'unscrupulous' out-of-state 
producers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In its appeal, California has garnered the support of Consumers Union, the 
Consumer Federation of America and the California Home Economics Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union, in a brief filed with the Court of Appeals, claims that some 
out-of-state chickens are not only frozen for shipping but "stored for months, 
or even a year, in a frozen state" before being sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy commissioned a 
review of the Federal regulation in February. Among the areas being studied: 
changes in poultry's physical characteristics at different temperatures, how 
spoilage becomes a factor in various refrigerated conditions, and how 
potentially harmful bacteria react to temperature changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think consumers would be appalled," Mattos said, "if they knew 
out-of-state chickens were frozen, thawed and sold as fresh."

 Bread doesn't demand much of you while it rises -- just that you be home three 
or four hours ahead to get it started. If you don't have that luxury, you can 
add club soda or beer to a package of Quick Loaf mix, stir it up, let it sit 10 
minutes in a loaf pan and bake.The resulting loaf doesn't have the chewy, 
elastic texture of kneaded bread, but it has a good fresh-baked aroma, and for 
home-made bread that's ready one hour after you open the package, with 
essentially no work, that's not bad. The cracked wheat and nine-grain flavors 
are particularly good, and there are also garlic, onion, oatmeal and 
cinnamon-raisin mixes. In supermarkets. Swimming for the Halibut

 Wente Bros. Winery of Livermore, Calif. has agreed to invest in Sameba Co., a 
winery in the Republic of Georgia -- where some scholars believe wine was 
invented thousands of years ago.Distribution is expected to be in the four 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries where Wente now distributes 
its own California wines: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Lithuania. UC 
Davis-trained winemaker Hughes Ryan has already moved to Georgia to supervise 
the fall's crush. The wines will be made from Rkatsitelli, a white grape, and 
Saperavi, which produces a dark red wine that ages well. "It's premature to 
say," says John Schwartz, Wente's vice president/international, "but we hope to 
produce a suitable product that meets U.S. standards within two to five years."

GREAT HOME COOKS; THE CANNING CULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bia Lowe, Susan Anderson and Joseph Herzberg are determined to make this 
summer last. How determined are they? In just one week recently, they pickled 
500 golden beets, made jam from a flat of strawberries, put up 12 jars of 
strawberry-rhubarb compote and 24 jars of strawberry-rhubarb jam, boiled down a 
half-dozen jars of pomegranate syrup and made a half-dozen jars of Victorian 
sauce (a chutney-like combination of rhubarb, raisins, brown sugar, ginger, 
cinnamon and allspice). 
</P>
<P>
 And the season hasn't even officially begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets pretty intense sometimes," says Herzberg. 
</P>
<P>
 While canning is something that is still outside the realm of interest of most 
cooks, for Lowe, Anderson and Herzberg it is a divine mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The madness started last Christmas with a plan to distribute homemade gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when we went into a frenzy," says Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was insane," says Herzberg. "We would go to the market in the morning, 
prep the stuff that evening, work all day the next day and at night come home 
and can. You have to be committed to canning. It is very labor-intensive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While last year's Christmas canning got off to a late start, this year they're 
determined the story will be different. As things come in season at farmers 
markets, they will quickly wind up pickled, jammed or preserved in Lowe and 
Anderson's well-organized Bronson Canyon kitchen in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we want to be sure to get every season," says Anderson. "Last year 
we missed plums. That was horrible. And we just got in on the tail end of the 
peaches. We really had to scramble to get that going." 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, we did 33 jars of those spiced peaches," says Herzberg. "October and 
November, we worked just about every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 They also gave out 30 sausage breads, a recipe from Anderson's Sicilian 
ex-mother-in-law. "It's delicious," she explains. "You roll out bread dough 
into a square and sprinkle it with ground pepper, olive oil, some raw Italian 
sausage and some onion. Then you roll it back up and bake it like a bread loaf. 
It is so aromatic and so full of fat. It tasts so good." 
</P>
<P>
 "But when we did it, we caramelized the onions," adds Herzberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "And added some fresh thyme," says Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some caramelized apples," concludes Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The three met at Kaiser-Permanente, where they all worked: Herzberg as an 
advertising and sponsorship events coordinator, Anderson as an art director, 
Lowe as a writer. Joined by their love of food, they were satisfied for a while 
with being good dinner-party cooks. "Actually, sometimes it seems like that's 
all we ever talk about," says Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last fall they took a class from preserving whiz Edon Waycott (author of 
"Preserving the Taste" and maker of jams and jellies for La Brea Bakery). 
</P>
<P>
 Now they've got a to-do list a mile long. Among this summer's entries: 
grapefruit and lime marmalades, sunshine strawberry jam, fig and ginger jam, 
pear and ginger jam, tomato jam, plum jam, pickled peaches, bread and butter 
pickles, dilled green beans, mushroom melange, tomato slices in oil, pickled 
cherries and apple-thyme marmalade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure if we can can three weekends a month, we ought to be able to reach 
our goal by Christmas," says Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, Bia, we do have to have a life outside of canning," says Herzberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Joe, you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably won't stop canning until we get some kind of horrible 
stress-related disease," says Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or kill each other," says Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, it's kind of spooky when you realize all the things you're able to 
can," says Herzberg. "Now when I look through cookbooks I go right to the back 
and look for canning stuff. It's amazing: In really surprising books you find 
all these canning treasures." 
</P>
<P>
 "And a lot of them aren't even meant to be canned," says Anderson. "But if 
they say something will store two weeks in the refrigerator, then the only 
question is: Will it fit in a jar?" 
</P>
<P>
 As in any high-intensity project, nerves can fray in the pressure of a 
heavy-duty canning push, but these three seem to have their division of 
responsibilities pretty well worked out. While they are pickling asparagus, for 
instance, the roles are clearly divided: Herzberg slices garlic in one corner 
while Lowe zests lemons in another. At the stove, Anderson combines the 
pickling mixture in a large saucepan and brings it to a boil. When it's ready, 
Lowe puts garlic and lemon in the bottom of each quart jar, then Herzberg holds 
it at a slant while Anderson slips in the asparagus. She ladles the pickling 
mixture into the jar, then wipes the rim and screws the lid on tight. When all 
the jars are filled, Anderson places them in the hot water bath. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that's really important is that we can play off each other 
so well," says Anderson. "We're a good team and we each have a role to play. 
It's about team work as much as it is about cooking. We have a fabulous time 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to get along doing this," says Herzberg. "It makes for some 
long days and it's a lot of work. You get up to be at the market at 8 in the 
morning and then you just keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even think about doing it without either of them," says Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get really sick of it, there's someone else there to keep you 
going," says Herzberg.

 "It just became a cult after a while," says Lowe, "the canning cult. It's a 
strange thing, but I have some friends up in San Francisco who want us to come 
up and can with them up there. Maybe it really is a cult."

 Make this sausage bread in the winter, when its richness and subtle sweetness 
are best appreciated. The bread recipe is based on one from Carol Fields' "The 
Italian Baker."  
</P>
<P>
 ITALIAN SAUSAGE BREAD 12 mild Italian sausages 3 onions, thinly sliced Butter 
3 Granny Smith or Pippin apples, cored, peeled and thinly sliced Bread Dough 
1/2 cup chopped fresh thyme Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Remove sausage meat from casings, fry in skillet and drain on paper towels. 
Divide into 3 equal parts and set aside.  
</P>
<P>
 In skillet caramelize onions in 2 tablespoons butter, divide into 3 equal 
parts and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In skillet slowly saute apples in 2 tablespoons butter until soft and slightly 
golden. Divide into 3 equal parts and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide risen Bread Dough into 3 equal parts and roll out each section into 
rectangle about 15 inches wide. Spread meat, onions, apples, thyme and pepper 
to taste on each rectangle. Gently roll up each rectangle into tube and curl 
into snail shape. Carefully place each bread in oiled oven-proof dish (9-inch 
souffle dishes work well, as do springform pans). 
</P>
<P>
 Let breads rise in warm place, covered with damp towel, for about 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 450 degrees about 40 minutes, until brown. Remove pans to rack and

 What do these asparagus pickles taste like? A lot like a good version of 
regular bread and butter pickles, except for a subtle undertone of asparagus 
flavor. We also tried them before they had finished curing and they were good

GREAT HOME COOKS; A CULTIVATING COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge de la Cal lives a civilized life in Silverlake. For one thing, there are 
always flowers -- flowers in the yard, flowers in the house, flowers in the 
food. For another, he cooks and eats seasonally, regionally and well. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's never bored: His garden is too big and demanding. There's always 
something to harvest, something to cook, a recipe to find, adapt, devise. . . . 
He must, poor soul, spend one full day a week in the garden just to keep the 
profusion in check. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden in question is in the narrow, steep back yard of the hillside 
townhouse de la Cal shares with his partner Les Sechler. Four years ago, there 
was nothing there, it was a "clean slate," as de la Cal puts it, except for a 
useless sprinkler system and a lot of wild fennel, a plant, de la Cal recalls 
ruefully, that has enormously long tap roots. Today, the only wild fennel in 
sight is in other people's yards, and the former clean slate is now a series of 
terraces, each tier burgeoning with healthy, often exotic plantings. De la Cal, 
who is a soft-spoken man with a quick smile, says with evident relief: "We've 
gotten to the point where we don't need to put in any more plants -- we just 
need to manage the ones we have." 
</P>
<P>
 An architect, De la Cal mixes living spaces with plants in a most inviting 
manner. At the base of the garden is the patio, where he and Sechler dine and 
entertain all summer long, a place surrounded by gardenias and flowering vines 
-- clematis, plumbago, a Barbara Karst bougainvillea that seems determined to 
swallow the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Above the patio is a wide-open bank of gray-green lavender, its serrated 
leaves and long purple spikes emitting a wonderfully sharp, soapy scent. And 
above that, beds burst with roses, penstemon, scented verbena, anemones, 
delphinium, geraniums and rock primrose. Vines and climbing roses cover the 
fence, creating privacy, insularity, the sense of a separate, blooming world. 
Finally, way, way up at the top of the lot, in the fullest sun, de la Cal 
cultivates his vegetables and other edibles. 
</P>
<P>
 On a fine day turned stormy this spring, de la Cal and I climb up to the food 
zone, pausing to admire the city view and the gathering clouds. Patches of sky 
are pale-green; the light, thick and golden, also has a green edge. The wind is 
whippy. Plants are beginning to thrash. Betty, de la Cal's happy Aussie-mix 
dog, is energized. Clouds turn the color of lead. Over tree-plumped hills, we 
see the skyscrapers of downtown and from this perspective, it looks deceptively 
as if the whole city sits in a garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Up among the vegetables, it's a bit muddy and in transition -- de la Cal is 
installing an irrigation line. One gets a sense not only of what once was, but 
also what's to come. Leaf lettuce, cress and French dandelion greens, which 
provided de la Cal and Sechler lavish salads all winter, are on the wane, and 
the chard is bolting. Youthful tomatoes, started from seed indoors, are just 
recovering from the big transplant into garden soil, as are a variety of 
peppers. Parsley curls out of cinder blocks set on their sides. A mature bronze 
fennel is dark, burnished and looks like an enormous bird with soft, exotically 
burnished plumage. A lime tree is laden. There are zucchini, cucumbers, all 
kinds of herbs. On the fence, a grape vine leafs out, with leaves so tender and 
green, they're translucent -- and perfect for stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the four years de la Cal has tended this ongoing work in progress, 
experience has taught him a thing or two. He has learned, for example, from 
planting and cooking with many varieties of the herb, that French thyme is the 
most delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 As for tomatoes . . . he's learned to keep it down: The first year, he planted 
way too many; his kitchen, he said, was full of bowls mounding with tomatoes: 
At first they looked pretty, but soon, they became a problem. Not every 
difficulty has been solved; de la Cal has not yet managed to get enough decent, 
full-sized ears of corn to justify the effort and space required for a crop. 
But that's OK, there are plenty of other things to try: sugar cane, borage, 
tomatillos. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that is not so civilized about de la Cal is his kitchen, which 
though tidy and well equipped, is small, pitifully small, for a serious cook 
and most especially because de la Cal is himself a residential architect. He 
has plans, he says, to make the space more workable, more open, more 
appropriate to his needs. In the meantime it's definitely a one-man show. 
Sechler, luckily, does not yearn to cook. "I'm the in-house busboy," he says. 
"I get to pour the wine, pick the flowers, clean up. Occasionally, I get to 
clean a mushroom." 
</P>
<P>
 When he cooks, de la Cal exhibits a careful, precise attention to small 
details; vegetables are beautifully chopped, ingredients carefully measured, 
set out ahead of time for easy assembly. De la Cal acknowledges his precision 
with a laugh: "Yes, architectural training is hard to get over."  
</P>
<P>
 Also, he cleans up as he goes along, every step of the way. "I have to," he 
says, "three dirty dishes, and that's the end of my counter space." In addition 
to his precision and diligence in the kitchen, de la Cal is also intrepid: 
willing and ready to experiment, even on his guests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such fearlessness has always characterized his cooking. De la Cal began 
cooking in high school. His mother, who prepared only Cuban food, "except for 
her lasagna," he says, let him come in and take over the kitchen whenever he 
wanted to. She didn't offer any instruction and de la Cal didn't seek it. In 
fact, he has never cooked one of her dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, de la Cal taught himself to cook by diving straight into "Mastering 
the Art of French Cooking" by Julia Child. "I made elaborate dinners," he 
laughs. "I cooked for special occasions. The more elaborate the better." 
</P>
<P>
 His sister Mayi Brady, herself a professional cook, laughs when she recalls 
those days her brother commandeered the kitchen. "Veal Prince Orloff!" she 
exclaims. "That was the first thing he ever cooked." 
</P>
<P>
 De la Cal frowns: Is this true? He can't really remember his first dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady insists: "Who could ever forget food called Veal Prince Orloff?" 
</P>
<P>
 They both remember the first artichokes he cooked. "We didn't really know what 
they were and had no idea how to eat them," says de la Cal. "I kept boiling 
them and boiling them, waiting for the petals and barbs to soften." Now, of 
course, there are silvery artichoke plants growing and bearing in his own back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Cal will tell you that his elaborate days are over, but that may be a 
matter of opinion. On this Friday night, the menu is sorrel soup, turkey 
galantine with rice, honey-glazed carrots, mixed green salad with edible 
flowers, berries with cream. And when he gives us some of his favorite 
garden-inspired recipes, simple is not a word that comes to mind: Chicken is 
cut in strips, marinated in stages, spooned into individual servings and folded 
into neat little corn husk packets for cooking on a barbecue grill. It may not 
be Veal Prince Orloff, but it is a far cry from slapping on a steak. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he's just grilling vegetables, they are tossed first in de la Cal's 
own scented oil (he takes a good olive oil, adds tarragon and pepper to one 
portion of it, roasted garlic to another, chiles to a third). 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborate? Maybe not. Civilized? Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have chard in their gardens will know the challenge of finding new 
and novel ways to present this perpetually producing vegetable. The following 
is a faintly curried treatment adapted by de la Cal from "Madhur Jaffrey's 
Indian Cooking. " BRAISED SWISS CHARD 8 cups rinsed, stemmed and chopped Swiss 
chard Salt 1/4 cup oil 1 tablespoon whole black mustard seeds 4 cloves garlic, 
minced 1 dried chile crushed Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 In pot blanch chard in lightly salted water. Drain completely.  
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large pan over medium flame. When oil is hot, drop in mustard 
seeds. As soon as seeds begin to pop, add garlic and stir until pieces are 
light brown. Add crushed chile and stir few seconds. Add chard and stir to mix. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 6 to 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Makes 4 servings.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This recipe makes inventive use of the corn husks used to wrap tamales. (Check 
step-by-step photo instructions to see how to make the packets.) De la Cal got 
the idea from his friend Cheryl Carrington, who wraps just about anything in a 
corn husk and throws it on the barbecue to unfailingly good effect. The husks 
trap the steam and cooking juices as well as impart their own delicious, 
roasted-corn flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 CHICKEN IN CORN HUSK WRAPPER 1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, 
cut in strips, or skinless, boneless thigh, cut in strips 3/4 cup herb and 
garlic marinade 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 small bunch cilantro Lime slices Corn 
husks soaked in water, 1 hour minimum Tomatillo Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Cover chicken with herb and garlic marinade, 2 hours minimum. During final 
hour, add lime juice and turn pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Make pocket of moist corn husks and place 6 to 8 chicken pieces inside, 
sprinkle with cilantro and add lime slice. Turn pocket ends over and tie with 
strips made from dampened husks. Place on grill when fire has died down. Cook 
30 to 40 minutes turning often so husks don't burn. Open packages and add 
Tomatillo Sauce. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomatillo Sauce 6 to 8 tomatillos, paper husks peeled 1/2 red onion 2 chipotle 
chiles 1/4 cup beef broth 1/2 tablespoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Chop tomatillos, onion and chilies in food processor. Add broth and salt.  
</P>
<P>
 Pour into saucepan and reduce over medium heat until mixture has consistency 
of thick sauce, about 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally to keep from burning. 
Makes about 3/4 cup sauce.

SUMMER STOCK; TOWARD A BACKYARD STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memorial Day weekend. It's the traditional kickoff of the outdoor entertaining 
season. Think of it as dress rehearsal for summer. And what could be easier 
than summertime entertaining? Informality rules. It's OK to use paper plates 
and napkins at a backyard party. When someone spills, you simply hose down the 
patio after everyone leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that most hosts aren't ready for summer. Some Southern 
Californians keep their parties outdoors all year round, but contrary to the 
"Land of Sunshine" myth, a lot of us have been indoors the past few months, 
cooking intimate suppers, hosting dinner parties and indoor brunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertaining outdoors may be more casual than indoor parties, but it does take 
some strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked to caterers who know better than anyone how to keep preparation to a 
minimum and costs down. They all agreed: The secret is to keep things simple, 
and keep a pantry stocked with basic food and table accessories. Stocking up 
doesn't mean lowering your standards, though. Buy food you enjoy. Buy in 
season. Buy in quantity. The pantry will work even when you are not 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterer Don Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Food suggests taking 
advantage of all the colorful produce available at farmers markets now and 
displaying them in their natural state: a basket brimming with washed, plump 
strawberries or red cherry tomatoes or perfectly ripe peaches; a platter of 
yellow, red and green peppers. "I'm big on the way a party looks," says 
Ernstein. "I once did a centerpiece that was a big sunburst of yellow squash 
and green zucchini. What's left can be used the next day in soup." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love potatoes and always have them around," says party planner Randy 
Fuhrman. "You can do a potato salad with vinaigrette, or mash them with sour 
cream, cream cheese and butter to serve with barbecue chicken. And even if you 
are on a diet, potatoes work. Mash them with the skins on and serve with salsa 
instead of butter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman, who was once given as a gift to Barbra Streisand (as a cook), swears 
by the canned salsa sold at Smart & Final. "It's probably one of the best on 
the market and costs half the amount of money as everybody else's. It's not 
like a fresh salsa, but you can add some chopped red onion, some chopped 
cilantro, fresh tomatoes and let it sit for a few hours." he says. "(The 
technique) is what we call 'fluff,' let's take credit for doing it from 
scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 Another caterer high on fluff is former news anchor Inez Pedroza, who runs the 
Creative Gourmet. "In the last two to five years," she says, "there have been a 
lot of products on the market that were never available before. Trader Joe's 
has a nice marinara sauce. Add some garlic, salt and a dash of butter and 
you've got a really nice sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all caterers advise doctoring up already prepared products to save time. 
Tom Byrne of La Cuisine prefers to work his menus around locally grown fruits, 
vegetables and herbs from growers markets in the area. "It's the freshest and 
the ripest and it's coming from California growers," he says. Right now is the 
best time to buy fresh basil in bulk. Wash it, puree it, pack it in a container 
with olive oil and you've got an array of instant entrees. "It keeps for months 
in the refrigerator as long as it's covered with oil," Byrne says. "You can use 
it for literally everything -- marinades, cold pasta sauces, basil sauce for 
beef or grilled chicken."  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing a lot of turkey chili parties which are really inexpensive," 
says Gary Budnick of Prime Time Catering, "We buy these giant rolls of frozen 
ground turkey at Smart & Final. That way you just take one of those serrated 
freezer knives and cut off what you need, and put the rest back in the 
freezer."  
</P>
<P>
 Salads made from grains or legumes are inexpensive and often improve if they 
sit for a day or two. Couscous, tabbouleh, wild rice, quinoa and mixed beans 
all keep well. Plus, says Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, "you can buy a bag of 
beans and serve 20 people."  
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman likes to prepare tri-tips for a crowd. The trick, he says, is to not 
overcook the meat. "They really take only a small amount of time." he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But ribs are another matter entirely. Fuhrman suggests boiling them first 
because it releases a lot of the fat and makes them tender. "Then I soak them 
in barbecue sauce, bake them in the oven and finish them off on the grill. The 
reality for me is that barbecuing is just to give really good marks (on the 
meat)." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to what to serve for dessert, Byrne, who catered Liz Taylor's 
last wedding, suggests buying ripe raspberries by the flat. Cook them with a 
bit of sugar, puree the mixture and then strain it for fresh raspberry sauce. 
"This is the time when they are cheap and you can do it," he says, "Otherwise 
raspberries are pretty much prohibitive." There are 101 uses for raspberry 
sauce -- as a dessert base, a topping for ice creams, over fresh fruit, or on 
shortcake. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortcake can be made ahead of time, too. With a food processor, it's 
possible to whip up batches of the dough in minutes, cut them into rounds and 
freeze them for later use. "Shortcake is a versatile, summery thing. All you do 
is crush the berries, bake the cake and add a little whipping cream," says 
Byrne. "And it doesn't have to be repetitive because you can make raspberry 
shortcake one day, then blueberry, blackberry, strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
 Another quick dessert: Buy plenty of sweet strawberries and melons in season, 
cut them into small pieces and freeze in small quantities. "Take them out of 
the freezer, throw them in the food processor for a flash," says Byrne, "and it 
becomes instant, delicious, refreshing sorbet." 
</P>
<P>
 "What you need to figure out is what freezes well," says Ernstein, who often 
caters for gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown. "I would never make 10 
chocolate cakes. People don't have refrigerator space for that. My (dessert) 
concept has always been that you have to have fruit, you have to have something 
that's chocolate and you have to have something that's not chocolate." He 
favors brownies, lemon squares or shortbread cookies because they freeze well, 
and fresh berries because, he says, "they look beautiful and all you have to do 
is wash them."  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, it doesn't cost that much more to buy the food than to make 
it. "One of the best parties I ever did was when I went to a Chinese takeout 
place and got containers of food. I bought extra empty containers and those 
became the vessels they ate out of," says Ernstein. "Then I ordered a huge 
stir-fry vegetable dish and put it on a big blue and white platter. Everyone 
ate with chopsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to ask themselves, 'Do I really have time to do this and am I 
really going to save enough money? Or should I go to a wonderful place that 
specializes in chicken?' " adds Ernstein. "Summer entertaining should be easy. 
If you love to cook, maybe make just one or two things and go pick up a great 
cherry pie somewhere. You don't have to make everything to call it your own." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing," adds Fuhrman, "is to have fun. If you really don't 
enjoy entertaining, it's going to come out in your food."

WINE: THE WINES OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As cool weather gives way to warm, and hot not far off, many people feel the 
need to switch gears in their wine-drinking. Room-temp red becomes less 
interesting than chilled, crisp white, and picnics conjure up stuff that's 
soft, slightly sweet and quaffable. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocking up wine for summer takes just as much thought as buying wine for 
those dinners by the fireplace, yet few wine shops are savvy enough to suggest 
the right warm-afternoon wines. There is these days a mania in America for 
Chardonnay, and since so much of this wine is white (thus chillable) and soft 
and slightly sweet, one might assume Chardonnay would be a great picnic quaff. 
Many wine shop owners still recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad thinking. After Petite Sirah, Chardonnay is my least-favorite picnic wine 
because of the high alcohol (above 13% in most cases) and the heavy oak flavor 
the wines often have. And in cheaper wines, that oak flavoring is not derived 
from aging in a barrel, but from the winemaker's latest trick: dipping in a 
huge teabag filled with oak chips. 
</P>
<P>
 What I look for in picnic and patio wine is good, strong, fruity flavor -- 
something to compete with the charcoal briquettes burning in the firepit -- and 
alcohol low enough not to intrude on the taste of the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocking up doesn't require a cellar. In the few months you will have the wine 
before it's consumed, nothing will happen to it if it's kept relatively cool 
(70 degrees is fine) and out of direct light. And I do suggest buying at least 
a case of wine to be sure you'll get good wine before it all sells out, and to 
have a few extra bottles around in case of emergencies, such as friends popping 
by unexpectedly, which always seems to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 If you look at the summer as comprising 12 weekends during which you and your 
friends will consume a bottle per weekend day, you'll need two cases of wine at 
minimum. So with that in mind, here are my suggestions for what to buy. Note 
that you may have to replenish the supply faster than you might think, 
especially if the wine is so good people drink it faster than you expect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chenin Blanc: This grape makes the great wines of Vouvray in France and, in 
California, a wine with a softer, more melony aroma and taste, perfect for 
picnics. Four bottles.  
</P>
<P>
 * German Riesling: A must for the summer. Try various producers of Kabinett or 
Spatlese wines, which are not totally dry but offer marvelous acidity and 
balance with less alcohol than most wines -- about 10%. Four bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gewurztraminer: I am smitten with this usually off-dry white wine. I prefer 
it drier so it matches with canapes and sandwiches. My summer buying pattern 
calls for a whole case of various producers' Gewurztraminers, but unless you 
have the same sort of fetish for it that I do, I'd recommend three bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sparkling wine: Light, crisp and a perfect summer beverage. Bubbly is always 
in fashion, and it is a great substitute for heavier white wines. Three 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sauvignon Blanc: You need not pay much more than $7 for some of the best of 
these wines, and usually you can find excellent wines in the $5 to $6 range. A 
great all-purpose wine, excellent with food. Three bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rose: Here we have the true all-purpose wine, usually made with enough 
flavor but still dry enough to match with food. Chilled, it is appealing to 
cool off with all by itself at poolside. Buy only the best ($9 a bottle or so) 
to make sure you're getting a high-quality rose, though Grenache Rose is being 
made better these days and may be found at $7 to $8. Three bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beaujolais: Great light red wine such as this is a real treat, especially 
when chilled and served with hearty foods. Three bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lighter-styled Zinfandel: Buy one bottle of a good Zinfandel for those 
moments when the evening air suddenly chills and demands a better, richer, 
heartier wine. 
</P>
<P>
 One final tip: Buy only the youngest vintages of any of these wines, and from 
producers whose names you know.

GREAT HOME COOKS; MRS. Z IN THE KITCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Go ahead, just put the pot down," says Valerie Williams airily. "That's a 
door, it won't burn." 
</P>
<P>
 So that's why the table top looks funny; it's a door mounted on legs. Williams 
is going through a divorce, and her furniture selection is currently a little 
spotty. Her father has helped out by making her this oddball table. 
</P>
<P>
 All the dishes on the table are a little spotty too -- decorated with spots, 
that is, in tribute to her 10-year-old Dalmatian. In fact, once you start 
paying attention, you realize a whole lot of things around this little Sunland 
cottage have Dalmatian-type spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Add a collection of 200 puppets (marionettes and hand puppets, including one 
of a Dalmatian) and the covey of antique garden trolls in the front yard, and 
you have a downright quaint environment. Williams' second-grade students at 
John C. Fremont School in Glendale, who know her from her former married name 
as Mrs. Z, have told her they understand that she's not a grown-up, just a 
"tall child." 
</P>
<P>
 Her ex-husband is a high-school sports coach, so she's had a lot of experience 
feeding big appetites, particularly on sports-watching holidays such as 
Memorial Day. A look at her bookshelf shows meat-and-potatoes stuff like Betty 
Crocker, "The Joy of Cooking," a lot of Frugal Gourmet and Family Circle 
cookbooks, a few books she inherited from her English grandmother; nothing very 
exotic. But there's more to her cooking than this. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I start with cookbooks," she says, "but I'm too stubborn to follow the 
recipes exactly. I always improvise." For instance, she uses the Frugal 
Gourmet's recipe for fried ravioli in blue cheese dressing but substitutes bow 
tie pastas because they hold sauce better. Her Parmesan bread is based on a 
simple pull-apart cinnamon bread often taught in preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Her exotic specialty is Jamaican. She has visited Jamaica five times, and each 
time she's brought back a lot of her favorite jerk spice mixtures. "I make jerk 
chicken and jerk ribs," she says, "and after football games, the parties always 
go overtime, I think because of the jerk spices I put in my chili." 
</P>
<P>
 She uses a lot of canned ingredients, but she also raises a lot of her own 
produce, particularly tomatoes -- she was harvesting from last year's plants as 
late as March this year. She is serious enough about desserts to have taken a 
cake-decorating class. (Her dessert-making, like the rest of her repertoire, is 
somewhat limited by her dietary need to avoid eggs, bananas and salt; and, for 
that matter, fish.) 
</P>
<P>
 Williams doesn't suffer from the recipe anxiety a lot of American cooks have. 
"In my opinion," she says firmly, "it's difficult to screw up a recipe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem odd to cook canned beans -- which are quite edible just warmed up 
-- for as long as 24 hours, but the result is very mellow, with a thick, silky 
broth. This recipe calls for the largest size of slow cooker.  
</P>
<P>

chili seasoning mix 1 teaspoon imported Jamaican jerk seasoning or 2 teaspoons 
bottled Jamaican marinade 1 pound ground beef, crumbled, browned and drained 1 
medium onion, chopped and browned 6 cloves garlic, chopped and browned 1 small 
green chile, such as serrano, chopped 8 to 10 small mushrooms, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 In large slow cooker put canned black beans, Great Northern beans, pinto 
beans, pinto beans with jalapenos, kidney beans and white beans. Add pork and 
beans and chili beans with sauce. Add chili seasoning and jerk seasoning. Stir 
in ground beef, onion, garlic, chile and mushrooms.

GOOD COOKING: THROW ANOTHER LOAF ON THE BARBIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbecuing has lost much of its seasonality but there's something about 
Memorial Day that triggers a rush to the grill. 
</P>
<P>
 I cook on a gas grill, and before the food goes on the grill, I often toss in 
a few chunks of wood (not wood charcoal), which imparts a wonderful smoky 
flavor. Last fall, however, Chez Panisse's Alice Waters came to visit from 
Berkeley, and she showed me a new way to convert my gas grill into a great 
source of wood-burning heat. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the grill is heated (covered) to the maximum for about 30 minutes (be 
sure the grill racks are removed so they're easy to handle). Then the gas coals 
are blanketed with mesquite without soaking the mesquite first. Close the cover 
again and let the wood burn until it's white with heat. Once the mesquite is as 
hot as it can get, turn off the grill and cook over the mesquite alone. 
</P>
<P>
 This method of cooking is especially effective for foods that cook quickly. 
Consider the garlicky meat-and-potato brochettes for this mesquite method. 
Marinated tenderloin and cooked new potatoes are threaded on a skewer with 
onion pieces. The meat weighs in at about four ounces a portion but with the 
potatoes, the meal is more than generous. It cooks in a matter of minutes. The 
grilled puff bread with rosemary and pepper also cooks swiftly to smoky 
perfection.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The potatoes must be precooked until nearly done before grilling, because the 
meat cooks so quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 GARLICKY MEAT AND POTATOES EN BROCHETTE 6 small oval new potatoes 1 (1-pound) 
pork tenderloin, well trimmed, cut into 1 1/4-inch cubes 1 sweet onion, cut 
into sixths 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 3 large 
cloves garlic, minced 2/3 cup parsley leaves, minced Freshly ground pepper 1/2 
teaspoon kosher salt 
</P>
<P>
 Boil potatoes in large pot with water to cover until nearly tender, about 12 
minutes. Drain. When cool, split lengthwise. Put potatoes in bowl with pork and 
onion. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil until warm. Add mustard and stir well. Add mixture to meat and 
potatoes. Toss well to coat pieces. Add garlic, parsley, pepper to taste and 
salt. Toss well to combine. Refrigerate several hours or overnight. Let come to 
room temperature before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide ingredients into 4 portions. Thread skewers in repeating pattern with 
meat, few onion pieces and potato in that order, ending with potato, leaving 
some space between ingredients to ensure thorough cooking. Season surface to 
taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Grill skewers on hot barbecue, turning as necessary, about 6 minutes total for 
medium-rare. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 340 calories; 411 mg sodium; 53 mg cholesterol; 
20 grams fat; 18 grams carbohydrates; 20 grams protein; 0.64 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking takes no more than two minutes on a hot grill and is best done after 
the meat is off the grill and standing. Stay by the grill -- the bread can 
easily burn over a hot fire. In this recipe, I use commercially available 
frozen bread dough, but it's even better to make your own . GRILLED ROSEMARY 
PUFF BREAD WITH CRACKED PEPPER 1 pound prepared frozen bread dough, thawed 
Extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon minced rosemary Kosher salt Freshly ground 
coarse pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Divide dough into quarters on floured board. Roll each into 5-inch diameter 
rounds. Line baking sheet with foil. Lightly grease foil. Arrange rounds in 
single layer on prepared baking sheet. Oil 1 piece of plastic wrap, then drape 
loosely over rounds. Bread can be cooked in 1 hour, left at room temperature or 
refrigerated as long as overnight. Let stand at room temperature until slightly 
risen and puffed. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil on stove top or in microwave oven. 
Lightly brush tops of rounds with 1/2 of oil. Flip rounds onto hot grill (use 
foil to help, splitting into fourths as needed for easier handling). Remove 
foil. Brush oil onto tops of rounds. Close cover. Cook about 1 minute until 
bread is browned on bottom. Use spatula to flip over. Brush any remaining oil 
on browned tops. Sprinkle with rosemary. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Close cover and cook until undersides are browned, about 1 minute. Remove from 
grill. Use kitchen shears to cut into quarters. Arrange on dinner plate with 
brochette and tomato. Serve warm with more olive oil, if desired, for dipping. 
Makers 4 servings.

 Each serving contains about: 360 calories; 724 mg sodium; trace cholesterol; 
65 grams fat; 56 grams carbohydrates; 10 grams protein; 0.01 gram fiber.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: PINKING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you ever been to Pink's when it opens in the morning, when the giant 
blocks of chili in the steam table haven't yet completely melted into orange 
grease, when the customers consist mostly of cops and copy-shop dudes, when you 
talk yourself into believing chili dog breath before noon may not be a 
liability? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the Pink's dog, uncouth and garlicky, tapered and uncommonly slender, 
skin thick and taut, so that when you sink your teeth into it, the sausage . . 
. pops . . . into a mouthful of juice. The bun is steamed, just so, soft enough 
to sort of become a single substance with the thick chili that is ladled over 
the dog, but firm enough to resist dissolving altogether, unless you order your 
hot dog with hot sauerkraut. (I do.) Crisp chunks of raw onion provide a little 
texture; a splash of vinegary yellow mustard supplies the hint of acidity that 
balances the richly flavored whole. Pink's also serves hamburgers, but it is 
the dog that is its glory, the dog that deserves a historic-preservation act of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Surmounted by a whirling sign advertising Hoffy's Meats, next to a vaguely Art 
Deco storefront that used to house, I think, Paul Pink's shoe-repair business, 
the chili dog stand Pink's -- always crowded, always exuding a garlic aroma you 
can smell a block away -- is as venerable a part of the Los Angeles landscape 
as the Hollywood sign. I used to go to Pink's a lot, usually to soak up the 
alcohol at 2 a.m., occasionally for a chili dog breakfast, but until last week, 
I hadn't been in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the walls are lined as ever with autographed 8x10 glossies, though 
upon closer examination the lineup has changed from starlets and obscure soul 
singers to obscure character actors and metal stars; clippings from the old 
West magazine have transformed into tear sheets from Buzz. Personally, I miss 
seeing disco diva E.G. Daily up on that wall, though it's nice to see that the 
photograph of Marty "Hello Dere" Allen remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, while nobody was paying attention, Pink's turned into something of a 
Dali-esque Mexican restaurant, with chicken fajita burritos and nacho cheese 
chili dogs, chili corn chips and giant 12-inch jalapeno dogs in addition to the 
customary chili-drenched XLNT tamales. (In case you're interested, Pink's 
guacamole is not so bad.)  
</P>
<P>
 Pink's was once the only place in town to find an idiosyncratic line of soda 
pop called Mitz -- real-life slogan: "Drink Mitz, Don't Schvitz" -- which has 
since been replaced by Barq's root beer and Dr. Brown's cream soda. Pink's also 
serves the worst French fries I have ever eaten -- limp, scorched-tasting 
things doused with handfuls of seasoned salt. 
</P>
<P>
 I have actually eaten something called the pastrami burrito dog, sort of a 
riff on the oki dog, which involves two Pink's franks, chopped onions, a piece 
of Swiss cheese, a gob of chili and a few rubbery slices of griddle-fried 
pastrami, all wrapped in a giant tortilla. Whereas the chili on the hot dogs is 
minimal, the chili and cheese in the burrito reach something approaching 
critical mass, which means it gums up in your mouth the way a peanut butter 
sandwich does when you take too big a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer density of the thing makes it not only difficult to open your mouth 
but almost impossible to build up enough jaw-torque to work your incisors 
through the pastrami. In practice, this means that, with your first bite, a 
strip of pastrami will invariably sort of flop back onto the burrito with 
animal force and spatter your favorite tie with a translucent orange goo that 
will make your dry cleaner shake his head in dismay. At least with a Pink's 
chili dog, no matter how eager the thing is to dissolve in your fingers, you 
are still more or less the captain of your own destiny. Pink's Famous Chili 
Dogs

GARDEN FRESH; PARSLEY: DON'T TAKE IT FOR GARNISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've gotten in the habit of whacking up a handful of parsley and throwing it 
over a dish, or tweaking sprigs from a bunch and sticking them on a plate -- 
then tossing the sprigs out with the leavings as though they were some inedible 
decoration. The thing to do is look at parsley afresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine that you'd never seen parsley before and someone brought you a plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorgeous! The clear deep-green, the graceful lines of the leaves seem to stir 
something primeval. Traditionally, the leafy sprig on the Passover Seder plate 
that symbolizes new life and hope is parsley -- not thyme or chervil (although 
in France, I suppose, it might be). 
</P>
<P>
 Now take a bite. To me, parsley tastes like water from a pristine creek -- 
crystalline, mossy, with the nip of crisp mountain air. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this country and in Britain, curled-leaf parsley is the ranking herb. 
Cultivars are becoming increasingly curled -- from single to double to triple 
-- and most are as felty as an English bank where wild parsley grows. Although 
it's not the preferred herb on the Continent, parsley is loved. There, though, 
it's flat-leaf parsley -- known as Italian in this country -- that is favored. 
It's considered to have richer taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Curled or flat, parsley leaves in a composition have a way of being either 
vibrant or subtle. Sprinkle them, finely chopped, over steamed potatoes, 
carrots, snap beans, boiling onions -- or sauteed mushrooms, eggplant, summer 
squash, peppers and tomatoes -- and the leaves slip gracefully into the 
background. Add chopped parsley to coleslaw, egg salad, a plate of cold meats, 
cucumber salad, bean salad, shredded raw kohlrabi or carrots, and the parsley 
chimes out clear as a bell. I suspect hot food wilts the leaves just enough to 
take the edge off their flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some herbs, parsley holds up well in cooking. A small bunch simmered 
with the makings of chicken soup gives enormous depth to the broth. You can add 
parsley at the beginning of any stew or sauce, but always add a little that's 
freshly chopped before serving to underscore the flavor and brighten the color. 
</P>
<P>
 But parsley shouldn't always be a bridesmaid. Devotees eat parsley as a 
vegetable. And why not? Why is curly chicory regarded as a salad vegetable but 
parsley's still an herb? A grand British tradition is parsley pie -- a little 
meat and lots of parsley. If you've tasted the luxury garnish, deep-fried 
parsley, you know you could have eaten a whole bowlful. Parsley salad -- lots 
of chopped parsley, a little minced celery and chopped hard-boiled egg -- is 
divine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When it's practical, it's best to chop parsley -- all herbs, in fact -- by 
hand, whether fresh or dried. You have absolute control over the texture, and 
only a little of the leaves' juice and oil is lost in the chopping space on 
your board. In a food processor, they're spread all over the work bowl and it's 
next to impossible to scrape them off.  
</P>
<P>
 If you like the taste of market parsley, your own will taste twice as good 
because only moments pass from picking to mouth. Hereabouts, you can harvest it 
year round. 
</P>
<P>
 The best sowing time for parsley is from one month before to one month after 
spring's last frost or the time when you can expect the weather to settle. Now 
is the perfect time. But you can't be in a hurry. Parsley seeds take weeks to 
germinate. To hasten the process, pour boiling water over them in a small dish, 
then let soak overnight. Next morning, sprinkle the seeds over a container of 
soil-less mix and grow indoors, or sow directly in the ground. Cover with 1/4 
inch of soil mixed half and half with compost (from the nursery). Mist 
carefully so as not to scatter the seeds. From then on, keep the soil moist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although slow, parsley is as undemanding a plant as you can grow. And one of 
the handsomest. It's hardy and will live two years or longer -- I have an 
Italian parsley plant many years old. Where winters are cold, parsley plants 
may vanish for a few months, but they'll come back sassy as jay birds in 
spring. Give parsley full sun or a few hours of afternoon shade if your 
summer's ferocious. Plants will grow in average soil but prosper in 
moisture-retentive, well-draining loam, so dig compost and peat moss into clay 
soil.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Added to the ease of growing parsley is that it self-sows. It likely won't 
flower the first year, but next summer it will send up flowering shoots. For 
the plants from which you'll want leaves, always pinch off flowering shoots at 
the base the moment they appear. But let a couple of plants bloom and set 
seeds. The wind and birds will scatter the seeds over your garden, and if you 
don't disturb the soil too much, the following summer there will be baby 
parsleys to transplant where you'd like them to grow. This happy cycle can go 
on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can spare a square foot or two, set aside a couple of plants to grow 
seeds. When the seeds have almost dried, lay a sheet under them and let the 
seeds drop onto it. Seeds of parsley are as tasty a condiment as seeds of 
caraway and celery. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants in the parsley family are a favorite food of many insects. The ferny 
leaves and petite umbrellas of flowers attract all manner of beneficial insects 
(those that polish off unbeneficial insects). Since the parsley grows a foot or 
more tall, I mix it among miniature day lilies, the ruffled with the smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you're not a gardener, you can grow parsley in a pot. In fact, that's 
how to have parsley nonstop if you live in an extreme climate. Set two plants 
three inches apart in an 8-inch pot in well-draining soil mix. In a 10-inch 
pot, you could add three pinches of sweet alyssum or lobelia around the edges. 
When it gets too hot or too cold outdoors, bring the pot indoors and set it in 
a well-lit place. Keep it moist but not wet, and spray with a diluted solution 
of liquid fish one month, then the same of kelp solution the next. After 
fertilizing, wait a few days before harvesting, then rinse well. 
</P>
<P>
 To harvest, pick outside stalks at the base, never taking more than one-third 
the plant, and always leaving the new growth at the center. 
</P>

<P>
 Beauty of form, purity of flavor, generosity in the garden, what more could we 
ask of a leaf? That it be nourishing. Parsley is -- it's loaded with Vitamin C. 
So we've seen our old friend in a new light. Time to sow your seeds.  
</P>
<P>
 SOURCES: 
</P>
<P>
 For seeds, you can find reliable cultivars on a nursery rack. Look for 
"curled" or "moss" in the name for a curled-leaf parsley, and "Italian" or 
"flat" in the name for the flat-leaf sort. Be sure the seeds were packed for 
this year.  
</P>
<P>
 For parsley from a flavor specialist, send for Krausa curled and/or Catalogno 
flat-leaf from the Cook's Garden, P.O. Box 535, Londonderry, Vt. 05148.

 I reach for chicken breasts when I need to serve something fast, easy and 
delicious. When the dish must be ultra-lean, I blanket the breasts with parsley 
and simmer them in cider, then add a counterpoint of lemon and a tad of creamy 
yogurt. A golden Soave complements the grassy parsley, and the sauce is lovely 
mashed into steamed potatoes and carrots. A crunchy bitter salad of chicory 
dressed with balsamic vinegar follows, then fresh strawberries and meringue 
cookies for dessert.  
</P>
<P>
 The parsley may be chopped several hours in advance (the amount is most of a 
bunch the size of which you'd find at the market). Cider (or apple juice) 
reconstituted from frozen has the freshest flavor. The dish takes less than 
half an hour, start to finish.  
</P>
<P>
 PARSLEYED CHICKEN BREASTS IN APPLE CIDER 6 skinless boneless chicken breast 
halves, about 2 1/2 pounds, trimmed of fat, at room temperature 2 cups minced 
parsley leaves and tender stalks 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 1/2 cups apple 
cider or juice 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 heaping tablespoon yogurt Salt 
Freshly ground white pepper Using broad side of chef's knife or wax paper and 
rolling pin, lightly pound chicken breasts until evenly thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread 2/3 cup parsley over bottom of 10- to 11-inch nonreactive skillet. Fit 
in chicken. Dissolve cornstarch in some cider in small bowl. Pour cider mixture 
over chicken, add remaining cider and shake skillet to blend. Sprinkle 2/3 cup 
parsley over chicken.  
</P>
<P>
 Set skillet uncovered over highest heat and bring to simmer, shaking 
occasionally. Turn heat to low, cover and simmer gently. Depending on thickness 
of pieces, start testing for doneness after 8 minutes. Make small cut with 
sharp knife in center of 1 piece (flesh should no longer be pink). Cooking time 
should be about 10 minutes altogether. Be careful not to overcook. Lift chicken 
onto heated platter, cover and keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Raise heat under skillet to highest and rapidly cook sauce until thickened, 
about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, whisk in lemon juice and yogurt. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Moisten chicken with sauce and turn rest into hot 
serving bowl. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup parsley over chicken and sauce and 
serve. Makes 6 servings.

 Each serving contains about: 219 calories; 125 mg sodium; 65 mg cholesterol; 
10 grams fat; 11 grams carbohydrates; 22 grams protein; 0.37 gram fiber.

BACK TO BASICS: AMICABLE SEPARATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some recipes call for egg yolks, others for egg whites. Still others call for 
both, but the eggs still need to be separated because they're used at different 
stages. Separating an egg sounds like a very simple task, but even some 
experienced cooks find it intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 The egg shell must be cracked near the center, where the diameter is largest. 
Holding it in one hand, either sharply tap the egg on the rim of a measuring 
cup or small bowl, or strike it with the blade of a knife. The goal is to break 
the shell only partway through. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point there are at least three ways to proceed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Holding the egg over a measuring cup or small bowl, pull the shells apart 
and catch the yolk in one half, allowing the white to spill over into the bowl 
(Method 1). Carefully transfer the yolk back and forth between the shell halves 
two or three times until the yolk and white are separated.  
</P>
<P>
 * Holding the egg over a measuring cup or small bowl, pull the shells apart 
and catch the egg yolk near the place where your fingers meet the palm of your 
hand. Spread your fingers slightly and the white will slip through into the 
bowl (Method 2), but the yolk will stay in your hand.  
</P>
<P>
 * Place one of the numerous egg-separating gadgets on the market over a 
measuring cup or small bowl. Open the egg over the place designed to catch the 
yolk (Method 3) and the white will flow over into the receptacle. 
</P>
<P>
 When separating more than one egg, it's wise to have one bowl for breaking 
them over and two others to transfer the yolks and whites to as they're 
separated. That way, if a yolk accidentally breaks, it won't affect the entire 
batch. Even a speck of yolk will prevent an egg white from whipping. 
</P>
<P>
 If a bit of yolk does get into the white, scoop it up with a piece of shell or 
paper towel. Shell fragments can also be scooped out of the white with a piece 
of shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Some classic recipes, such as cold souffles, contain uncooked eggs. In recent 
years, outbreaks of food-borne illness caused by raw eggs contaminated with 
Salmonella enteritidis have prompted the U.S. Department of Agriculture to 
recommend consumers avoid eating raw eggs and foods containing raw eggs. This 
is particularly true for the elderly, the very young, the chronically ill, 
pregnant women or others with a weakened immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 Newer cookbooks may have updated recipes that either omit or call for 
thoroughly boiling the eggs to destroy the harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recipes, including those printed in The Times' Food Section, use large 
eggs. If you have jumbo or medium, here is what the USDA has to say in its 
"Home and Garden Bulletin No. 103," "Eggs in Family Meals -- A Guide for 
Consumers": "Substitution of another size often makes little difference in 
results. In some recipes, however (sponge and angel food cakes, for example), 
the proportion of egg to other ingredients is of special importance. For these 
recipes, it may be necessary to increase the number of eggs if you are using a 
smaller size." 
</P>
<P>
 Common market sizes and their minimum weights per dozen (in the shell) are: 
Jumbo -- 30 ounces. Extra-large -- 27 ounces. Large -- 24 ounces. Medium -- 21 
ounces. Small -- 18 ounces. Peewee -- 15 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 One large egg equals approximately three tablespoons volume. Substitute the 
same number of extra-large, medium or small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two large eggs equals approximately one-quarter cup plus two tablespoons 
volume. Substitute the same number of extra-large or medium eggs or three small 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three large eggs equals approximately one-half cup plus two tablespoons 
volume. Substitute three extra-large eggs, four medium eggs or four small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Four large eggs equal approximately three-fourths cup plus one tablespoon 
volume. Substitute three extra-large, five medium or six small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Five large eggs equals approximately one cup volume. Substitute four 
extra-large eggs, six medium eggs or seven small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Six large eggs equals approximately one cup plus three tablespoons volume. 
Substitute five extra-large eggs, seven medium eggs or eight small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight large eggs equals approximately 1 1/2 cups plus two tablespoons volume. 
Substitute six extra-large eggs, 10 medium eggs or 11 small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten large eggs equals approximately two cups volume. Substitute eight 
extra-large eggs, 12 medium eggs or 14 small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve large eggs equals approximately 2 1/4 cups plus two tablespoons volume. 
Substitute 10 extra-large eggs, 14 medium eggs or 17 small eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a while a recipe will call for a specific amount rather than a number 
of eggs, yolks or whites. It takes the following number of whole eggs to make 
one cup: 
</P>
<P>
 Small -- seven. Medium -- six. Large -- five. Extra-large -- four. 
</P>
<P>
 This number of whites or yolks makes one cup: 
</P>
<P>
 Small -- 10 whites; 18 yolks. Medium -- eight whites; 16 yolks. Large -- seven 
whites; 14 yolks. Extra-large -- six whites; 12 yolks. 
</P>
<P>
 Publications from the American Egg Board state that the freshness of eggs is 
determined by how recently an egg was laid, the temperature and humidity at 
which it is stored and how it is handled. "These variables are so important 
that an egg 1 week old, held under ideal conditions, can be fresher than an egg 
left at room temperature for one day." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the board, "The ideal conditions (for egg storage) are 
temperatures that don't go above 40 degrees and a relative humidity of 70% to 
80%. Fresh shell eggs can be stored in their carton in the refrigerator for at 
least four to five weeks. Grade quality losses should be insignificant if the 
eggs are refrigerated as soon as possible after purchase from a refrigerated 
case. "As an egg ages, the white becomes thinner and the yolk becomes flatter. 
These changes do not have any great effect on the nutritional quality of the 
egg or its functional cooking properties in recipes. Appearance may be 
affected, though. When poached or fried, the fresher the egg, the more it will 
hold its shape rather than spread out in the pan."

LOW-FAT COOKING: POTATO SALAD GOES PEPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With Memorial Day weekend just around the corner, many of us are busy planning 
our holiday barbecue with an emphasis on healthy eating. With that in mind, you 
may want to add this flavorful, low-fat roasted pepper-potato salad to your 
menu. A one-cup serving contains only one gram of fat. If mayonnaise instead of 
nonfat plain yogurt were used for the dressing, the fat grams would soar to 34 
per serving. 
</P>
<P>
 For additional flavor, the potatoes are first cubed, then cooked in chicken 
broth and garlic. Oven baking allows the potatoes to cook evenly without 
breaking up. Letting the potatoes cool in the broth allows them to absorb more 
flavor. The broth from the potatoes may be discarded or used in preparing other 
dishes, such as soups or sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sprinkling of chopped cilantro just before serving gives a well-rounded 
fresh flavor. ROASTED PEPPER-POTATO SALAD 2 1/2 pounds red potatoes, cut into 
1-inch cubes 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can chicken broth 3 cloves garlic, minced Salt, 
pepper 1 sweet red pepper, roasted, peeled and cut into 2-inch-long strips 1 
yellow pepper, roasted, peeled, and cut into 2-inch-long strips 1 green pepper, 
roasted, peeled and cut into 2-inch-long strips 1 red onion, minced 2 stalks 
celery, cut diagonally into slices Chipotle Dressing Chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange potatoes evenly in bottom of 3-quart rectangular baking dish. Pour 
chicken broth over potatoes. Stir in garlic. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Cover and bake at 400 degrees about 1 hour or until potatoes are

</P>
<P>
 Toss together drained potatoes, red, yellow and green peppers, onion and 
celery in bowl. Stir in Chipotle Dressing and chill. Sprinkle with chopped 
cilantro before serving. Makes 8 servings.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: ONE LAKE, TWO DAYS AND 12,000-TOO-MANY HOLES IN ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of El Segundo's new golf practice range recently discovered an 
unexpected hazard: The lake built in the middle of the driving range is filling 
up with golf balls -- and it's costing the city a lot of money to fish them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to see their balls make a splash," said Jim Fauk, director of the 
Recreation and Parks Department. Fauk said many duffers, who pay several 
dollars to hit a bucket of rented balls onto the range, aim for the lake about 
130 to 160 yards off the tees. Anyone, whether swinging a pitching wedge or a 
five-iron, has a good shot at it -- too good, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the city-owned range's grand opening, workers had to toil late 
into the night picking balls from the two-foot-deep lake. By the time they 
finally clocked out at 3 a.m., they had fished out about 12,000 balls. That 
means about one of every 10 balls hit off the tees was winding up in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the City Council voted unanimously to solve the problem by filling 
in the concrete-lined lake with dirt and sod, at a cost of about $12,000. 
Construction of a costly drainage system will account for much of the hefty 
price tag, Fauk said. The fill-in project is expected to be completed next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, golf course workers will continue to scour the lake bottom for 
balls. Bill Schickler, who operates the course, said a recently purchased hand 
cart will make the task a little easier. 
</P>

 The catfish are coming! The catfish are coming! 
</P>
<P>
 The exact date is a closely held secret, but sometime soon the California 
Department of Fish and Game will stock the 14-acre Alondra Park Lake in 
Lawndale with hundreds of 15-inch-long channel catfish. It's part of the 
department's "Fishin' in the City" program, designed to give people who can't 
make it out of town a chance to enjoy the thrill of hauling in a big one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This provides an opportunity for a lot of retired folks and youngsters to 
enjoy fishing," said Fish and Game spokesman Patrick Moore.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, 14 lakes in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties will be stocked 
with about 110,000 pounds of catfish, Moore said, more than double the amount 
last year. The fish are brought in from a catfish farm in Hanford. About 1,000 
pounds of whisker fish will be put in Alondra Park Lake each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Cariaga, recreation services manager for the El Camino district of the 
county parks department, said catfish thrive in the lake, which ranges from 
about four feet to 30 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done real well there," Cariaga said. Although many are caught, he 
said, holdovers from previous stockings may still be swimming. Some real 
monsters could be lurking in the depths. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, of the Fish and Game Department, said the lake water is monitored 
periodically to ensure that it is clean and that the fish are edible. 
</P>
<P>
 To fish in Alondra Park Lake or any urban lake, anglers must have a valid 
fishing license. A one-day permit costs $8.65, and an annual fishing license 
costs $24.40 -- probably less than you'd spend for a blackened Cajun catfish 
dinner for two at a restaurant.

 Getting the public to turn in weapons seems to be a little more fruitful when 
an incentive is offered. Especially in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angles County Sheriff's Department started collecting guns May 8 on a 
"no questions asked" basis. It's the first time the sheriff has actively 
solicited the public to turn in guns. The latest department figures, which 
cover the first nine days of the program, show that only 47 guns were turned in 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, only four showed up at the Carson sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, when officials in Hartford, Conn., offered money and gift 
certificates for weapons earlier this month, more than 4,000 weapons came 
through the door in five days. In Anaheim last February, the Mighty Ducks 
swapped two hockey tickets for each of the 104 guns they received in a one-day 
exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department will continue to accept guns without asking for the 
owner's identification through June 8. Information: (310) 830-1123. QUOTE OF 
THE WEEK

 "If this were a company, it would be the most dynamic firm. Many of the

ELECTIONS; GOP SETS ITS SIGHTS ON 2 SEATS IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT IT LOST LAST 
TIME; BEST CHANCES FOR THE REPUBLICANS ARE THOUGHT TO BE IN THE 53RD AND 54TH 
DISTRICTS, WHERE REGISTRATION IS SPLIT ALMOST EVENLY BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES.

<P>
 Republicans have begun their effort to recapture the two South Bay Assembly 
seats they lost two years ago, with a field of primary candidates largely 
unknown beyond their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance adjuster David Bohline and insurance agent Julian Sirull, both of 
Redondo Beach, are seeking the nomination in the June 7 primary in the 53rd 
Assembly District, which stretches from Venice to Palos Verdes Estates. The 
winner will face Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) in the November 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighboring 54th District, which includes the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
and Long Beach, Rolling Hills Estates restaurateur Jeffrey Earle and Rancho 
Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall are running for the GOP nod to face Betty 
Karnette (D-Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats now hold all five of the Assembly seats that encompass parts of the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Democratic primary race for the Assembly with opposition is in the 
52nd District, which includes Gardena. There, incumbent Willard H. Murray Jr. 
faces former Compton City Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore and Los Angeles 
businessman Stephen Hamlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the South Bay seats, Republicans have their best chances in the 53rd and 
54th districts because registration is split almost evenly between the two 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Republicans considered it a fluke that Bowen and Karnette won in 1992. 
Bowen, a lawyer, beat Redondo Beach Mayor Brad Parton, whose fundamentalist 
Christian views and opposition to abortion turned off some of the GOP faithful. 
Karnette, a math teacher, defeated 14-year Republican incumbent Gerald N. 
Felando in a race many Democrats had written off as lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got fried" in 1992, said Keith McCarthy, chairman of the Los Angeles 
County Republican Party. He says Republicans were hurt in 1992 by Ross Perot's 
independent candidacy and by President George Bush's decision to give up 
campaigning in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we don't have Bush or Perot to contend with," he added. "The 
candidates will be selected on their own merits."

 In the 53rd District, Bohline and Sirull each base their campaigns on 
improving the state's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohline, 26, who was a delegate to the Republican National Convention and a 
Republican volunteer as a student at USC, says the state needs to cut taxes, 
further reform the workers' compensation system and limit tort lawsuits in 
civil courts. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, the legal system encourages criminals to file frivolous 
claims against cities in hopes of winning a big payout. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirull, 36, says businesses should get more tax incentives, and he too favors 
further workers' compensation reform. He also says the state could set up 
job-training programs that are customized to new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's role is to create an environment to get the companies here and to 
help entrepreneurs create their own businesses," Sirull said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates differ on only a few issues. Sirull favors a ban on assault 
weapons. Bohline does not. Sirull says he would accept the recent Assembly pay 
raise; Bohline says he would not. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohline said he has spent about $10,000, and Sirull said he has spent $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising funds has not been as easy this year as it was for Parton in 1992, 
when the candidate spent about $740,000 on his losing campaign, McCarthy said, 
explaining that Bohline and Sirull don't have the same name recognition that 
Bowen or Parton do. Bohline and Sirull "are straight out of grass-roots 
politics," he said. "It's great that they are running, but unfortunately, (not 
being well-known) is a disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, McCarthy said, Republicans are "sweating and drooling" over a 
match in the 54th District with either Earle or Kuykendall against Karnette. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle, 35, runs a Red Onion Restaurant his family owns in Rolling Hills 
Estates. Kuykendall, 47, is a mortgage banker who has served on the Rancho 
Palos Verdes City Council since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats still have a slight edge in registration in the district, but both 
Republicans have lined up high-profile endorsements. Former U.S. Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese supports Earle, and former California Gov. George Deukmejian backs 
Kuykendall. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have strong financial support. Earle said he has raised about 
$175,000 for his campaign, including a personal loan for $25,000 and a $50,000 
loan from his mother.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm spending money like a drunken sailor," Earle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall said he has spent about $70,000 so far, most of it raised from 
small contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't written myself any big checks," Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have chided Karnette, saying she would take a pay raise that a citizens 
commission recently granted state legislators. (Karnette has taken no position 
on the raise.) 
</P>
<P>
 Effective in December, lawmakers' annual pay will rise 37%, from $52,500 to 
$72,000. And like their counterparts in the 53rd District, Earle and Kuykendall 
consider themselves more fiscally conservative than the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle also has tried to show differences between himself and Kuykendall, 
saying his GOP opponent has supported tax increases as a City Council member. 
Kuykendall voted for a utility tax last year to help raise revenue for road 
repairs and street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponent has supported some tax increases while on the (Rancho Palos 
Verdes) City Council," Earle said. "I'm for lowering taxes. I would not support 
any further taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuykendall said he doesn't "have any intention of raising anybody's 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he calls for reducing the number of state regulations that force 
cities to spend extra money to meet their requirements. In addition, he says, 
the state can operate more efficiently, just as Rancho Palos Verdes has had to 
do in the face of declining revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would use Rancho Palos Verdes as an example of how to deliver government 
services," Kuykendall said. "We're getting a lot of bang for our buck." 
</P>

 The Democrats' race for the 52nd Assembly District had the makings for a true 
political thriller, featuring two candidates whose public lives have been 
peppered by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Murray (D-Paramount) has been widely condemned by Compton civic 
leaders for supporting a state takeover of the insolvent Compton school 
district last year. And Moore, the former Compton City Councilwoman, has 
provoked criticism that she is a political opportunist.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential for a raucous campaign filled with accusations, the 
contest has instead turned into a sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no forums and little campaigning. Murray, 63, said he has been 
speaking to church and community groups when he flies home from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray already is predicting victory over Moore, 46, and Hamlin, 29. The 
winner of the primary will face Republican Richard A. Rorex, a Gardena 
engineer, in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've won three elections fairly handily," said Murray, who beat Moore two 
years ago and is seeking his fourth term. "There's no indication that this time 
should be any different." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore says she's had little time for the campaign trail because she has been 
caring for her ailing mother in Ventura County. Moore said she had not planned 
to enter the race but changed her mind after receiving numerous phone calls 
from residents complaining that Murray had lost touch with the district, which 
covers Gardena, Compton, Lynwood, Paramount and the southeastern tip of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said the state takeover of Compton schools should be considered one of 
his significant achievements. Last year, Murray sponsored legislation granting 
the school system an emergency, multimillion-dollar bailout loan. The district 
fell under state control as a condition of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members denounced the state intervention, arguing that it was 
wrong to usurp local control, but Murray said the move was necessary to salvage 
a district in financial and academic ruin. "I will accept any unpopularity that 
decision caused," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's critics portray him as an aloof legislator unconcerned with his 
constituents' problems and say he received the lowest rating among 78 Assembly 
members in a recent survey conducted by California Journal, a magazine that 
covers state politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray dismissed the survey's findings, pointing out that less than 17% of 
those polled actually returned the survey.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore also has some political liabilities. She is an alleged target in an FBI 
bribery probe dating to her time as a Compton city councilwoman. Moore said she 
has not been contacted by federal authorities and knows nothing of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time candidate Hamlin, meanwhile, believes he offers a fresh alternative 
for voters. A resident of southern Los Angeles, Hamlin said he is walking 
door-to-door in the district to highlight his platform, which calls for 
improved schools, more jobs and police reform. "I won't say I'm very well-known 
right now, but I'm building up a lot of support in the community," he said.

A MATTER OF (ACADEMIC) LIFE AND LIMB; HEALTH: CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS HAS 
TAKEN GIANT STEPS IN THE FIELD. ITS BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM IN PROSTHETICS IS 
UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF ONLY THREE IN THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 For four hours a day, five days a week, Ken Smith toils at a workbench in a 
dusty basement, applying physics, handcrafts and a touch of psychology to the 
project at hand -- making legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith fashions artificial limbs out of plastic, metal and rubber as part of 
his program in orthotics and prosthetics at Cal State Dominguez Hills in 
Carson. It's the only undergraduate degree program of its kind in California 
and one of only three bachelor's level prosthetics programs in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Smith ran a construction business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to use your mind than your brawn," Smith said as he fidgeted with 
the adjustments on a leg.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith needs both the dexterity to build the legs and the clinical expertise to 
make sure they fit, as well as the empathy to work well with patients.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are people out there that have the hand skills but don't have the 
people skills," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosthetists fill a doctor's prescription the same way a pharmacist fills a 
drug order, but doctors expect prosthetists to make suggestions about which 
artificial knee, limb or foot would work best for each patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is one of several students who designed prosthetic legs for Matt 
Baughman, 21, who acts as a patient. Baughman and several others are paid to 
come to class three times a semester to be measured and fitted for limbs, 
giving the students a chance to practice their craft. 
</P>
<P>
 When the class is over, the legs are generally disassembled and the parts 
reused.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the professional patients made their final visit to Dominguez 
Hills, modeling the new legs while students discussed techniques for 
fabricating the pieces and answered questions from instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, such as Smith, whizzed through the process and presented a 
functioning artificial limb. Others haven't yet finished their limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students take advantage of carbon graphite supports and high-tech metals 
that flex and add spring to a patient's step. Another new design uses a suction 
seal to hold the prosthetic device on the patient, providing more stability and 
keeping water out. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitted with the newest technology, people with artificial limbs run marathons, 
swim and play football, basketball and other sports. Prosthetists take the 
patient's activity level into consideration when they choose from the 125 
prosthetic knees and dozens of feet available in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in making an artificial leg is to create a plaster cast of the 
patient's residual limb. From that, a "check socket" is made of clear plastic. 
When the patient tries on the check socket, the prosthetist can see against the 
transparent surface those points were the skin is pinched by excessive 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 After assembly of the final socket, knee joint, foot and ankle, the 
prosthetist adjusts the leg again. Often it's covered with foam that is colored 
and shaped to match the patient's other limb. Last week, the emphasis was on 
the function of the students' projects. As the patients walked back and forth, 
instructors observed the motion and gait of each leg.  
</P>
<P>
 It takes practitioners about three weeks to make a below-the-knee prosthesis, 
which costs $2,500 to $6,000, and about six weeks to make an above-the-knee 
model, which costs $4,000 to $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, patients replace their prosthetic devices every three to five 
years, often using the same prosthetist.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lifetime relationship," said Scott Hornbeak, the director of the 
program at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 12 students will complete five semesters in the classroom and then 
spend 3,800 hours in a formal internship -- half in prosthetics, or the 
replacement of body parts, and half in orthotics, which is the bracing of body 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 To get certification, students must pass exams that test general knowledge, 
technical expertise and patient management.  
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 are currently certified by the American Board for Certification in 
Orthotics and Prosthetics, based in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before becoming accredited, the students' work is in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as an out-of-work (prosthetist)," said Ed Ayyappa, a 
Dominguez Hills instructor. Fresh out of school and uncertified, practitioners 
earn $28,000 to $40,000, Ayyappa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining a relatively unknown profession does come with a disadvantage, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word prosthetist will get you some raised eyebrows," said Dana Glidden, 
who added that she follows it with a quick explanation: "I'm in school to make 
artificial limbs and braces."

Vista, South-Central and Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 71% D, 18% R 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Unlike in 1992, Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker Jr. will face 
Republican opposition in November. But he has a solid political base because 
registration is lopsided in favor of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate occupation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrat: Curtis R. Tucker Jr., incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republican: Adam M. Michelin, businessman 52ND DISTRICT

 Area: Gardena, Lynwood, Paramount, Willowbrook and portions of Compton, 
Florence, Long Beach and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 80% D, 11% R 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Willard H. Murray beat Patricia A. Moore two years ago and 
predicts he will do so again. But he's been condemned by Compton civic leaders 
for supporting a state takeover of the Compton school district last year. Moore 
also has some political baggage. She is an alleged target in an FBI probe 
dating to her time as a Compton city councilwoman. But she says federal 
authorities have not contacted her and she knows nothing about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate occupation:

 * Democrat: Stephen Hamlin, businessman; Willard H. Murray, incumbent; 
Patricia A. Moore, public affairs consultant

Redondo Beach, Torrance, Rancho Park, Venice, Playa del Rey, and portions of 
Palos Verdes Estates, Westchester and Mar Vista.  
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 45% D, 41% R 
</P>
<P>
 Background: David Bohline and Julian Sirull, both from the insurance business, 
aren't spending much on the primary, have little name recognition and have 
never held elected office. The one who wins the primary will face Debra Bowen. 
Some Republicans have all but conceded her reelection. But Bowen was an unknown 
when she won the seat two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate occupation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrat: Debra Bowen, incumbent

Estates, San Pedro, Signal Hill, and portions of Palos Verdes Estates, 
Wilmington, Hawaiian Gardens and Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 45% D, 41% R 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Republican voters on the Palos Verdes Peninsula could split their 
votes between Jeffrey Earle and Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall, 
both of whom are well-known locally. So it could be up to Long Beach residents 
in incumbent Betty Karnette's hometown to cast the swing votes. Analysts say 
she beat longtime Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando in 1992 because of his lack of 
campaigning in the district's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate occupation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrat: Betty Karnette, incumbent 
</P>
<P>
 * Republican: Jeffrey Earle, restaurant executive; Steve Kuykendall, mayor of 
Rancho Palos Verdes, businessman

portions of Long Beach and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 68% D, 19% R 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Former Assemblyman Richard Floyd considered running but decided 
not to once the filing deadline arrived. That left incumbent Juanita M. 
McDonald unchallenged in the primary. She should have an easy time in November 
with no Republican challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate occupation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrat: Juanita M. McDonald, incumbent

Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Westchester and Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 52% D, 33% R 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Incumbent Sen. Ralph C. Dills, 84, helped form Cal State Long 
Beach, has met Franklin D. Roosevelt and refused to support Japanese internment 
camps. But despite a legislative and judicial career dating to 1938, he's still 
new to many of the voters in his reapportioned district. George Nakano is the 
strongest challenger of Dills' career, although Mike Sidley could draw away 
some of the anti-incumbent vote. Republicans see a chance to win in November if 
Dills faces David Barrett Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate occupation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrat: Ralph C. Dills, incumbent; George Nakano, Torrance 
councilman/educator; Jo Ann Rodda, real estate broker; Mike Sidley, attorney

 HAWTHORNE SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition B: Should the Hawthorne School District issue up to $15 million in 
bonds to renovate schools and build new ones? 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Supporters say schools are overcrowded and need repairs and 
renovation. If the measure passes, the district will be eligible for matching 
state building funds. U.S. CONGRESS

 Background: Both Susan Brooks and Ron Florance are for abortion rights -- 
muting an issue that split the Republicans two years ago. But Republicans can't 
get too hopeful yet. Brooks and Florance have engaged in a war of words. Will a

EL CAMINO INSTRUCTORS TO PROTEST SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Camino College instructors, frustrated over stalled contract talks, are 
taking their complaints public with plans to picket at graduation ceremonies 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks broke off with college administrators several weeks ago after faculty 
members, who have not received a pay raise in three years, rejected an offer 
that included 1% salary increases in July and January. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an insult considering we haven't gotten any pay raise in the last 
three years," said Lance Widman, a political science professor and president of 
the faculty union. 
</P>
<P>
 The union requested this week that a state mediator step in to end the 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructors, who want an additional 2% raise during the 1995-96 school 
year, will distribute flyers at graduation detailing their complaints, Widman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract talks began 18 months ago for college instructors, who earn $29,000 
to $60,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Torrance-area college said the school cannot make a more 
generous offer to instructors. Dwindling funds from the state have made such 
increases impossible, said President Sam Schauerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the El Camino Federation of Teachers, which represents 700 full- 
and part-time employees, voiced dissatisfaction with college administrators at 
a union meeting last week. All of the 100 faculty members in attendance cast 
no-confidence votes against Schauerman, and 95% of them voted no confidence in 
the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors, barred in their contracts from striking, also will take their 
protests into the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, instructors often have permitted students to be added to full 
classes. But many instructors plan to refuse to permit additional students to 
enroll in their summer and fall classes once the roster is full, Widman said.  
</P>
<P>
 That news disappointed Schauerman, who said classroom protests hurt students 
while doing little to further negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schauerman said college administrators would like to continue negotiations 
with the faculty, but he said talks could not resume if the union called for 
state intervention.  
</P>
<P>
 Widman said teachers would be willing to accept the college's last offer if 
they were given assurances of a more generous raise in the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I assure them of that?" Schauerman said. "I have no idea what the 
state is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The college received $30 million in state funds last year, and officials 
expect a 50% decline in funds this year, said business manager Victor Hanson. 
Increased enrollment fees and more revenue from local property taxes are 
expected to help make up the difference.

POLITICS: LOCKYER'S COMMENTS ON NAKANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was shocked to read state Sen. Bill Lockyer's comments regarding Torrance 
City Councilman George Nakano's campaign for the Senate against incumbent 
candidate Ralph C. Dills, as noted in the "Political Notebook" column (May 5).  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lockyer, in commending Sen. Dills for his then-unpopular opposition to 
Japanese internment camps during World War II, suggests that Councilman Nakano, 
as a Japanese American, should not run against Dills in deference to the 
senator's longtime alliance with the Japanese American community.I strongly 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 For too long, Japanese Americans have taken a back seat in the political 
arena, somehow escaping true empowerment as legislators. And Lockyer, who may 
have had only good intentions in making his statement, demonstrates an attitude 
that only helps perpetuate this lack of leadership in our community. Must we 
always be subservient, making way for others to speak out on our behalf? I 
think not. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dills is a good man. He has been an exceptional leader, and he has been a 
good friend to the Japanese American community. But Councilman Nakano has every 
right to challenge him in the Democratic primary, and in doing so, helps to 
illustrate the principles of equality upon which our government is based. Sen. 
Dills spoke out during World War II to protect and uphold those rights. 
Councilman Nakano is exercising them in 1994.

TEACHERS: CONTRACT IMPASSE IN BEACH CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reorganization of school districts in the South Bay cities of Redondo, 
Hermosa and Manhattan Beach has brought significant changes resulting in some 
successes, frustrations and adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 As retired teachers who served two of the predecessor districts, one the 
Manhattan Beach Elementary School District and the other the South Bay Union 
High School District, we would like to comment on the current contract impasse 
in the new Manhattan Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to commend our former colleagues -- elementary and high school 
teachers -- for standing together and telling the school board that if they 
want high morale and quality instruction over the long term for our community, 
they are going to have to pay for it. Pointing to Sacramento and poor-mouthing 
the teachers and citizens won't fly while they sit on a reserve of $20 million 
that could be tapped to provide the kind of education that is expected and 
deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 We especially commend the elementary teachers, who are supporting their new 
high school colleagues even though it is not in their immediate self-interest 
to do so. They are demonstrating the kind of professional solidarity that in 
the long term will provide our community with quality education. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we suggest that the district's lawyer, Catherine Hagen, sign up for a 
refresher course in arithmetic with one of our third-grade teachers. Perhaps 
then she will realize that a 12-0 vote by the executive committee of the 
teachers union recommending a rejection of the district's proposal and a 166-26 
vote against acceptance by the teachers shows an overwhelming support for a 
bargaining team that Ms. Hagen feels does not represent the membership.

POLITICS: PAY RAISE FOR THE LEGISLATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ironically, the first newspaper article I read about the $20,000 pay raise 
being given to California's lawmakers was reported on the same page as news 
that our state's unemployment rate had risen a full percentage point in the 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to envision a group of employees less deserving of a pay hike than 
the politicians representing us in Sacramento.California's economy continues to 
falter and a million residents can't find a job to support themselves or their 
families. And businesses continue to flee California, taking jobs with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Our economic plight can be traced to the openly hostile, anti-business 
attitude of our state Legislature, which has raised almost every tax on the 
books and added thousands of pages of regulations in the past few years. Yet 
our elected leaders continue to look elsewhere for solutions, refusing to admit 
that they are the cause of our economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting a pay raise in the middle of economic tough times is a slap in the 
face to California's taxpayers. Unfortunately, our Assembly representative 
Betty Karnette is silently accepting the raise, toeing the line for her mentor, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (who actually wants a larger pay raise). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm running for election to the state Assembly because I'm fed up with the 
nonsense, and I believe I can make a positive contribution in Sacramento, not 
because I want to line my pockets with taxpayer money. I've pledged not to 
accept the $20,000 pay hike. I hope my opponents will do the same.

POLICE: TRAFFIC TICKETS AND MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm a tax accountant, a father of three, coach of a Little League basketball 
team, a member of St. James Church in Redondo Beach and I have never spent one 
day in jail. I moved to California in September, 1982, from Kansas and have 
always lived in the South Bay. I am a law-abiding citizen with the utmost 
respect for the law. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel that policemen are under-appreciated and underpaid no matter what the 
pay is. I do not feel that I would have the courage to risk my life on a daily 
basis for any amount of money, especially in these times. 
</P>
<P>
 During the time I've lived here, I've been stopped on an average of about once 
every two years and I felt in most cases it was unwarranted, but I wrote it off 
as part of the crime scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years I have been stopped three times. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time, I was on the 405 Freeway coming from Orange County about 1 
a.m. The officer followed me for about five miles. When I started to exit, he 
stopped me and gave me a ticket for speeding, even though we were keeping up 
with traffic and other cars were passing us. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time, I was coming from coaching a game. My 12-year-old son and 
three other team members were in the car. The officer gave me a ticket for 
going 50 m.p.h. He clocked me going 50, but I was getting ready to make a 
right-hand turn and I was in front of my home. When he stopped me he made me 
get out the car. He did not talk to me like I was an individual but like a 
criminal in front of my son. He asked me how long I had been dating my 
girlfriend, who was not a minority, and I told him about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point he went to her and asked her what she was doing with me and 
stated he was going to write me a speeding ticket. After the officer left, my 
son, along with his teammates, who were not minorities, wanted to know why it 
was not OK for my girlfriend to be with us. 
</P>
<P>
 The third time, I made a right turn coming out of Del Amo shopping center. The 
officer followed me through three red lights, and when I started to turn at 
Torrance Boulevard he pulled me over. He said that I had run a red light. I was 
very upset because the officer had stopped with me at all of the red lights, 
but later I realized the ticket was for running a red light while making a 
right, which was over three or four blocks back. And the light was yellow when 
I made the right turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The most disappointing part of this story starts when I decided to fight the 
traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 A) First, when officers did not appear in court for other traffic violations, 
about 90% of the cases that were dismissed were individuals who were not 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 B) Out of the 60 cases I had to sit through no one was found "not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 C) The officers involved in my cases flat-out lied to obtain the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 I have visited other countries around the world and have never been treated 
the way I've been treated in this country. I was born and raised in this 
country, but the illusion that a good education, hard work and obeying the law 
is a way to be treated fairly and with respect is a simply a dream. I have some 
hope because I have the ability to leave this country, which I'm seriously 
considering, but if you do not have a college education, an above-average 
income and you are a minority, you simply have no hope. 
</P>
<P>
 I will continue to set a good example and be a positive role model, but I want 
you to know that I have lost a great deal of respect for the men we pay to 
protect us and our court system.

<P>
 Two local organizations plan to unite to form the Council of Governments to 
work on long-term social and economic projects for the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay Cities Assn. and the South Bay Corridor Steering Committee will 
discuss the issue tonight, Redondo Beach Councilman Joe Dawidziak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Council of Governments would apply for federal and state funding 
for projects that cross city boundaries, such as housing and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the organizations agree to consolidate, final approval will be needed from 
16 South Bay cities, Los Angeles County, and Los Angeles' 15th District 
covering the San Pedro and Harbor Gateway areas, Dawidziak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will be at 7 in the music room of the Torrance Cultural Arts 
Center, 3330 Civic Center Drive. SUSAN WOODWARD

 After years of repeated requests from residents to slow down speeding 
motorists, Gardena will install trial speed humps in two areas -- on Electric 
Street and in an alley in the 2100 block of El Segundo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 City crews will begin installing the humps this month, said Gardena Public 
Works Director Ken Ayers. The project will cost $3,000 to $5,000, Ayers said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HERMOSA BEACH; CITY COUNCIL ADOPTS 'FILM-FRIENDLY' POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This city's reputation in the film industry might have been tarnished last 
year, but city officials are determined to bring film crews back into the 
city's neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a policy approved Tuesday by the City Council, Hermosa Beach will 
promote its photogenic streets using the California Film Commission, a branch 
of the state Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's high time we encourage filming in this town," said Councilman Robert 
(Bergie) Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the promotional activities under consideration is a bus trip through the 
city for location managers to scout out potential filming spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council voted to amend the city's zoning codes to permit 
filming in and around homes, hoping to prevent a rerun of last year's battle 
with residents over the filming of the television show "Beverly Hills, 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 A Torrance Superior Court judge ordered the show's producers to stop filming 
at an oceanfront home after residents complained that the crews, trucks and 
heavy equipment disrupted the neighborhood. The judge ruled that the filming 
violated city laws prohibiting business activity in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council said the city's former zoning codes failed to reflect the city's 
"film-friendly" position. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy only restricts filming in residential areas between 7 and 10 
a.m. unless producers get written permission from nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, crews need residents' approval to film more than five straight 
days or more than 20 days a year. JAMES BENNING

<P>
 Three cities on the Palos Verdes Peninsula are seeking volunteers to work with 
the Lomita sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates 
will be trained to help the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 
particularly during times of civil unrest or natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're organizing this at the request of the cities after we had some of our 
wonderful disasters over the past 1 1/2 years," Lt. Jim Oneal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Helen Reardon of the Civilian Volunteer Program said more than 3,600 
volunteers work for the 19 sheriff's stations throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers must do at least 16 hours of work per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Team leaders have been selected from Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos 
Verdes, but Rolling Hills is still seeking leaders. Each city will have 10 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested residents should contact their city hall. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: SURVEY FINDS SUPPORT FOR LAND PRESERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 60% of residents on the Palos Verdes Peninsula are prepared to pay an 
extra $25 to $100 a year to help preserve more open space there, according to a 
recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it has strong local support for preservation, the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Land Conservancy, which organized the survey, is considering putting 
a measure on the November ballot to raise funds to buy open land.The 
conservancy has preserved two peninsula parcels since it formed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are highly encouraged by the results," conservancy President Bill Ailor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that residents of all four cities look at preservation of natural 
areas as important to maintaining their quality of life, and even in these hard 
economic times are willing to pay to make it happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey by J. Moore Methods of Sacramento questioned 600 peninsula 
residents. Three peninsula cities, local organizations and several land owners 
helped pay $28,000 for the survey, Ailor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Survey results show an initial 49% of respondents supported a property tax 
measure, but the figure jumped to 60% after arguments for and against land 
preservation were explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Of four specific properties the conservancy is considering buying, an 838-acre 
parcel in the Portuguese Bend area is the highest priority in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heavily used for hiking and equestrian riding. It's a wildlife habitat. 
It's the largest piece of open space in southwest Los Angeles," Ailor said. 
"It's just a beautiful place."  
</P>
<P>
 The other three properties are 14 1/2 acres at Hawthorne Boulevard and 
Windport Drive, a 6 1/2-acre open field along Palos Verdes Drive North, and 163 
acres at the end of Forrestal Drive.

SCHOOL NEWS: L.A. UNIFIED: NEW MAGNET DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has extended the deadline for 
applications to its expanded magnet school program to June 3.  
</P>
<P>
 The school board expanded the program May 2 to help alleviate long waiting 
lists and offer a wider choice of schools.The expansion is expected to create 
24 new magnet centers and will accommodate nearly 8,000 more students in the 
program, said district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay area will have two new centers for the 1994-95 school year, one 
at Curtiss Middle School in Carson and one at Wright Middle School in 
Westchester. The existing magnet program at San Pedro Marine Science High 
School will expand to include ninth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who applied before the original deadline of April 15 but who wish to 
be considered for the new locations must reapply, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the district received more than 40,000 applications. The program 
has 9,500 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Created in the late 1970s in response to pressure to desegregate the district, 
magnet classes specialize in particular subjects, are smaller and tend to 
produce higher test scores, officials said. The program now has 108 centers and 
schools, and serves nearly 37,000 students in the district. JON GARCIA

SCHOOL NEWS: REDONDO BEACH: CLAS TEST DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redondo Beach school officials continue to refuse to administer a portion of 
the controversial CLAS test, despite protests from state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted May 9 not to administer the English and writing 
portions of the California Learning Assessment System test to eighth- and 
10th-graders.Students are taking other parts of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have not stated publicly their concerns with the exam's English 
and writing portions. Redondo Beach is one of six school districts in the state 
to refuse to administer all or part of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 18 letter to the school board president, Acting State Supt. William 
D. Dawson urged the board to reconsider its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (state school) board and I both believe the decision violates the law," 
Dawson wrote. "Although I do not relish the thought, the department will pursue 
whatever action is possible . . . if you refuse to give the 1994 CLAS tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach school board attorney Joan Birdt said Wednesday that the 
district is preparing a response to the state. The board will probably discuss 
the issue at its next meeting on June 6, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The exam is mandated by the Legislature as part of an effort to improve public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the portions of the exam designed to judge writing and reading 
comprehension are more psychological than academic and invade student privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the tests engage students in interesting and provocative 
reading material and prompt them to write passionately and with conviction.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE; COUNCIL PASSES MEASURES TO THWART NEPOTISM

 The Lawndale City Council approved two measures last week to prevent nepotism 
at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted unanimously in favor of a law that prohibits the city 
from hiring relatives of top city employees and elected or appointed officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also would bar relatives from working in the same department 
under certain circumstances. Current employees would not be affected as long as 
they remain in their present positions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council voted 3 to 2 to bar the appointment of relatives to 
committees. Mayor Harold E. Hofmann and Councilman Larry Rudolph voted against 
the new policy. They said the measure was aimed at Rudolph's wife, a parks and 
recreation commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Rudolph was first appointed by Hofmann 12 years ago, four years before 
Councilman Rudolph was elected. SCOTT SANDELL

BRIEFLY; TRAFFIC: CONSTRUCTION OF WHEELCHAIR RAMPS 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic lanes in several streets in Torrance, Rolling Hills and San Pedro will 
be reduced or closed next month when construction starts on wheelchair ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Amo Boulevard westbound and Hamilton Avenue northbound will be reduced to 
one lane and the left-hand turn lanes during working hours, said Donna 
Guyovich, spokeswoman for the county Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandini Street in San Pedro will be reduced to one lane in each direction, 
Guyovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on Del Amo Boulevard eastbound, Hamilton Avenue southbound, and 1st, 2nd, 
3rd, 6th, and 7th streets in San Pedro is not expected to affect traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting in the ramps is expected to be completed in June or July and cost 
about $59,000, Guyovich said. SUSAN WOODWARD

BRIEFLY; SCHOOLS: TRUSTEE TO QUIT SCHOOL BOARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Manhattan Beach school board will appoint a replacement for Gary Collins, 
a board member who plans to resign June 30 because of ill health. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manhattan Beach Unified School District trustees voted earlier this month 
to appoint a replacement rather than hold a special election, which will save 
the district $20,000, said Supt. Gerald F. Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members hope to fill Collins' seat by mid-July. His term expires in 
November, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, 56, said he recently was treated for Hodgkin's disease. The Mira 
Costa High School graduate, who fought for the recent creation of the city's 
school district, has been a board member since 1981. JAMES BENNING

SCHOOLS; SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM FOCUSES ON ABSTINENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eighth-graders had seen it all before. 
</P>
<P>
 A model wearing tight jeans and a bra. A man and a woman draped over a 
motorcycle. A couple passionately embracing in an ad for toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids in Room 401 at Lennox Middle School already knew about the power of 
sex. On Friday, they learned a little about how to resist it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of stuff about sex on TV and magazines," said Daymein Richardson, 
a 14-year-old student at Lennox. "But it isn't true. It's not like real life." 
</P>
<P>
 Through slide shows and discussions, a state-funded program is trying to help 
kids understand media and peer pressures to have sex. The goal is to encourage 
abstinence among teen-agers, who had about 12% of the babies born in Los 
Angeles County in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, started in 1991 and called Education Now and Babies Later, 
targets 12- to 14-year-olds. In the South Bay, schools in Lennox and Inglewood 
use the curriculum as part of regular sex education classes, which include 
information about contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth and Family Center in Inglewood, which administers the program 
locally, uses high school students rather than adults to present the material. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way, it's not just a teacher standing up there talking to them," said 
Linda Potter, a Lennox administrator. "The presentation is much closer to the 
level of the children, and that makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not boring like other classes," said Jessie Alvarez, 14. "We take it 
seriously, but it's also a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Students participate in five one-hour sessions covering a range of topics. 
</P>
<P>
 The first session looks at the risks of early sexual involvement. The second 
and third sessions deal with pressures from society, the media and peers. A 
fourth class teaches verbal and nonverbal assertiveness techniques. As a 
follow-up, educators hold a fifth session a few weeks later to reinforce the 
concepts and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're helping young people to understand that they can say no without hurting 
someone's feelings," said Judith Pratt of the state Office of Family Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the program has reached more than 180,000 students in California and 
more than 2,000 in Lennox and Inglewood. The Los Angeles Unified School 
District also incorporates the material, as do districts in Culver City and 
Beverly Hills, Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the Youth and Family Center in Inglewood said they hope to 
expand the program to schools in Hawthorne, Lawndale and Torrance next year. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years, the program will soon be evaluated by researchers at UC 
Berkeley to see if the presentations keep youths from having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter of Lennox Middle School said she believes the program has made kids at 
least consider postponing sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have learned, and studies have shown, that if you just give kids the 
information about reproduction, it doesn't have much impact," Potter said. 
"This program helps them to think through their choices. It reinforces the idea 
that they are in control of their body."

PEOPLE: CRAFTSMAN ALMOST MISSED HIS CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From his Marina del Rey garage studio, Al Greenberg, a retired tire salesman, 
fashions Jewish icons from clay. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, 68, says he finally has discovered what he was meant to do on this 
earth.  
</P>
<P>
 Among his pieces: a chess set that depicts an Israeli soldier as a knight, a 
synagogue as a rook, a rabbi as a king and Greenberg's wife as a queen. It and 
other pieces sell at the Museum of Tolerance on Wilshire Boulevard and other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 For 35 years he was the Al in Hal and Al's Tires in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't like Hal go to Al" was their motto.  
</P>
<P>
 "These hands encrusted with grease and oil, why, I thought, 'These hands can't 
create anything but work,' " he said in his booming voice. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his road to the tire shop started with a failure.  
</P>
<P>
 "I washed out of Air Force cadet school," the Los Angeles native said. "I'm 18 
and I'm heartbroken. I went looking for some of my buddies, and I passed the 
old Hal Roach Studio and saw a sign for the first motion picture unit. I had 
taken some photojournalism classes in high school. Ronald Reagan was the 
personnel officer. He interviewed me. He sent me to war and he stayed home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Greenberg tried several ways to make a living. He went broke 
several times. He even became a butcher for a while to support his wife, 
Charlotte, and son, Ken. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his brother decided to go into business together selling and repairing 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The business flourished, and his life gained direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day I walked out of the business 10 years ago, I dropped an anchor. I 
never felt motivated to do anything and stick to it. I tried guitar lessons, 
Spanish lessons, bought a sailboat, rented a motor home and drove to all of the 
Indian reservations, but nothing felt right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we went to Africa as part of a study abroad program. When we returned 
home, Charlotte became ill -- something which was not related to the trip. I 
couldn't go sailing or biking because we always did everything together. I 
don't like to do anything alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when Charlotte got better, she turned her interest toward her first 
grandchild, who was born shortly after they returned from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 So, at 65, Greenberg went to West Los Angeles College after being persuaded by 
a friend to take some basic ceramics classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with the whole thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg started with masks. But no one wanted to buy them. He stopped going 
to classes and started to develop his own style. He liked setting his own hours 
too. Then he began doing Judaica, pieces that depict Jewish life and history. 
He makes religious figurines and scenes of the Wailing Wall and people at 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clay is dirt. It's earth. I get a religious feeling from the work but I am 
not a religious man. I didn't want to follow a mold. I feel like a Jewish-male 
Grandma Moses because I started so late. My work is primitive in many ways. I 
have a certain amount of talent, but what I turn out comes from my heart," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also teaches ceramics in the Las Virgenes School District, where his 
grandson is in elementary school. "When I give my grandson a gift that I have 
made, it will outlive me. It's stone. Stone will be around for a long time and 
he can say, 'My grandpa made that,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's pieces sell for $30 to $4,000 at the Museum of Tolerance, Gallery 
Judaica on Westwood Boulevard and J. Roth Bookseller on Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Every piece is signed and has its own story. It's an original. Just like Al. 
</P>

 Inglewood resident J. Michael Kelly has been named Irish American Citizen of 
the Year by the Irish News of California, one of the nation's largest Irish 
newspapers. Kelly, a family law attorney, was selected for his legal work, 
along with his contributions to civic, environmental and charitable 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The California Music Educators Assn. has named Rancho Palos Verdes resident 
Cecilia Riddell its Outstanding Music Educator of the Year. Riddell, who 
teaches at Cal State Dominguez Hills, specializes in the study of children's 
traditional games and chants.  
</P>

 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) honored Torrance parents Jill 
Gilligan and Selga Ruzzano as local Women of the Year. They raised $18,000 in 
private funds to rehabilitate their children's neglected kindergarten 
playground. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Women Business Owners recently honored several South Bay 
women for their contributions to the local economy: Manhattan Beach resident 
Vivian Shimoyama, San Pedro resident Barbara Sullivan, Rancho Palos Verdes 
resident Ava Doner and Rolling Hills resident Gordana Swanson.

THE JOB LUCK CLUB; UNEMPLOYED PROFESSIONALS TRADE IDEAS, FIND SOLACE AMONG 
OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around a rectangular table, a dozen business executives critique videotapes of 
job applicants interviewing with a recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing with that pen on the desk," one notes.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's slouching, not good," says another. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the interviewer asks a 60-year-old applicant the trick question: "What 
are your weaknesses?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pick up on things as quickly as I would like to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the best answer -- pointing out his own flaws. But he need not worry. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a mock interview, one that everyone around the table went through in 
their first week as members of The Job Club, an exclusive group of South Bay 
out-of-work white-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Members have to be professionals, by and large holding college degrees. Many 
of them are middle age or older. They believed they would spend their careers 
at their companies, but they were laid off or offered early retirement in the 
last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules of the club are stringent: All members must wear business clothes, 
including ties for the men, even though they are out of work. Each member must 
spend four hours a week helping to answer phones, type into computer databases 
or survey prospective employers for openings at club headquarters. And who 
directs the out of work to this exclusive group? The state unemployment office. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Employment Development Department launched such self-help groups for the 
once highly paid unemployed in the late 1960s, when aerospace cuts put highly 
skilled engineers and white-collar administrators out of work. The Torrance 
group -- officially the Professional Career Assn. -- was started seven years 
ago. It serves residents from Santa Monica to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The professionals who arrive at the unemployment office have "a lot of 
frustration, anger, a feeling that the world owes them," said Agnes Dodd, 
manager of the Torrance office. "It is much more difficult for them to accept 
that they are out of work than, say, the (blue-collar) worker who already has 
gone through a cycle of layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To displaced professionals -- some of whom haven't interviewed for a job in 
years -- the club is their surrogate corporation. Here, a former nuclear arms 
expert teams with a former Disney Imagineer to craft a good resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were a company, it would be the most dynamic firm," said club 
President Herbert Woertler, a former Sears sales executive. "Many of the 
members are advanced in age, tremendously experienced. They're the ones that 
brought the rockets to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 These white-collar workers, many of them former aerospace workers, previously 
had viewed the state employment office as the place where the down-and-out 
waited in long lines for their unemployment checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenifer Wald Morgan, 40, said that when she first walked into the state 
unemployment office, "it was like 'Hang on to your purse.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But after the unemployed computer consultant joined the club, "suddenly there 
was this magical room in the back, people that were professional, in the same 
situation that you were." 
</P>
<P>
 The club's vice president, A.W. Hedge, decked out in a double-breasted suit 
with silk pocket handkerchief, is in charge of "external affairs," spreading 
the word to local elected officials and corporate chiefs about this group of 
available professionals. He comes equipped with Professional Career Assn. 
business cards, which list his title and address. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedge was trained in marketing and public relations and worked as a management 
consultant in Connecticut. But he tired of the weather there and moved to 
Southern California five months ago, even with the dire job market.  
</P>
<P>
 He has not found a job, but he strolls through a bakery in downtown Torrance, 
schmoozing with the president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce. 
When it comes to the club, his sales pitch easily rolls off his tongue: "We act 
like headhunters, but for no cost." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To promote its members, the club uses their combined brain power. If it's 
sending out a cover letter, they've got a technical writer to help. A job 
database? There's plenty of software engineers for that. Videotaping a new 
public service announcement to promote the club on cable TV? They have the 
former Disney designer. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some computer engineers have created grand plans for job database 
networks, and "you have to remind them that the whole reason for being here is 
to look for a job," Woertler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment department provides the club with a room and pays phone 
charges, but members must raise money for other expenses by selling raffle 
tickets, soliciting companies to donate old computer equipment and even 
gathering groups to go to talk show tapings, where producers offer $200 if 
enough members show up to fill an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the cramped club room, members monitor the phones to get the latest tips on 
job openings, which are posted on a chalkboard called "The Hot Board." Cryptic 
messages, such as "UPS LA citywide 30 sales positions," urge members to call 
immediately before positions are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members also are encouraged to volunteer elsewhere, not solely for the 
philanthropy of it. Job contacts can be made at the local Rotary and YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creative people are going to do things to keep themselves sane," said Edwin 
Peura, 53, who retired as the chief of staff of the space and missile systems 
center at the Los Angeles Air Force Base two years ago. "It's an opportunity to 
broaden into other areas." When he left the military, Peura thought an 
aerospace job in the private sector would be waiting for him. He had a 28-year 
career behind him, including a stint in the early 1980s as part of the Geneva 
arms talks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I sent resumes out, but I had friends in high places who just told me . . . 
(I) couldn't have picked a worse time to retire," Peura said.  
</P>
<P>
 But his two years of volunteer work as a vice president at the club, as well 
as with the Hawthorne Chamber of Commerce and the South Bay Assn. of Chambers 
of Commerce, have pointed him to a new career path: government affairs. He's 
been interviewing for employment as a legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really having a ball," said Peura, who has had to draw on savings and 
refinance his home to make ends meet. "I'm really enjoying things. I say to new 
(club members): 'Don't stay at home. Get out and do things.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another club member, J.W. Wong, for years had thought ofleaving his career as 
a theme park attraction designer for the Walt Disney Co. He wanted to become a 
video producer. When Disney laid him off in August, 1992, he quickly put his 
goal into action. He has produced public service announcements for the club, 
and is at work on longer versions that can be used as infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm sitting around waiting for a job," said Wong, 46. "I'm 
trying to do what I want to do on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been a struggle. The value of his Torrance house is dropping, and 
he has dipped into savings, including his children's college funds. 
</P>
<P>
 His annual salary was $67,000 at Disney, but his search for leads among theme 
park design firms, video production firms and other amusement companies turned 
up empty. He recently interviewed for a position as a sales agent at Delta 
Airlines, but was told he was overqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't think I'm going to transfer into a $5-an-hour position," he 
said. "That's one of the problems I am having." 
</P>
<P>
 The club has averaged about 280 members per month this year, and about 40 have 
found work each month. It is better than at the depths of the recession two 
years ago, when only about 15 members per month were finding work. But many 
find themselves competing against hundreds of job applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance unemployment office as a whole places about 150 to 250 people per 
month, Dodd said. The state also offers job training workshops to blue-collar 
workers, although the club's services are more comprehensive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is more difficult" for professionals to find work, Dodd said, 
citing the need to network with prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Woertler, the club president, is entering the third year of his job search. 
With Sears cutting commissions to its sales force, he retired early at age 55, 
after 20 years with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to say at Sears, 'You're a member of the family,' " he said. "In my 
case, Mom and Dad got a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Woertler began tucking away savings 15 years ago. But others did not have that 
foresight. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many were not prepared for this," Woertler said. "We have members who have 
lost their cars, their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, club members get free counseling. Credit 
counselors also are available, and members help each other when they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have people calling me constantly," said Sandra Livingston, who was laid 
off from her job as an administrative aide at Hughes Aircraft Co. in El 
Segundo. "Some are hysterical. They need a place to live, or their phone was 
turned off."

 A 42-year-old computer consultant, who did not want his name used, is sleeping 
on another member's couch. His Hermosa Beach apartment, which also served as 
his business, was damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake and his computer equipment 
was wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at the end of my ropes financially; I hocked a camera," said the man, who 
so far has had little success in finding a job. He even applied for a job at 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to no avail.

 Many club members in the battered aerospace industry counted on their 
employers to provide a lifetime of security.

 "If you found yourself in need of a job, half the time you could call someone 
you know," said H.C. Hunt, 60, a former aerospace contract negotiator at 
Rockwell International in El Segundo. "It worked for (the) last 40 years in 
(the) aerospace industry very well." 
</P>
<P>
 But the recession changed things. "It's deader than a dead circuit now," Hunt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt took early retirement two years ago, with the intent of finding another 
job. He worked as executor of a friend's estate, but when that was finished 
last year, he found it wasn't so easy to re-enter the work force. He didn't 
even try other aerospace firms, but turned to state and municipal purchasing 
departments and insurance companies. Finally, two weeks ago, he got a job as a 
settlement negotiator at a law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not exactly what he had hoped for: He works as an independent 
contractor, which means he gets no benefits, and has to commute from his home 
in San Pedro to Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's glad to have a job and is excited about a new challenge. The club, 
he said, helped him realize that his true talent is in negotiating, not 
necessarily in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of dealing with multimillion-dollar aerospace contracts, he negotiates 
insurance claims worth thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 30 or 40 years of doing this, I've found it's all personal, no matter 
how much money is involved or what is at stake. When (President) Clinton is 
dealing with Russia, it comes down to a personal relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, the computer consultant who was out of work for about a year, found a 
job through a former club member who worked at Alpha Therapeutics in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the ultimate network," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after she found a job, Morgan still helps out her colleagues at 
the club, recently spending a weekend helping Wong produce a video. And she 
hopes to recommend a club member if Alpha has another opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she became a club member, she made friends, she said. "There is a 
compassion, kind of like a soap opera, to always see if you could help." On the

 Each month, Retired Air Force Col. Edwin Peura and other out-of-work business 
executives get dressed up in suits and pack their portfolios with paperwork to 
listen to an expert size up the South Bay's economy. These meetings are 
orchestrated by The Job Club, a self-help group for white-collar workers who 
are back in the job market. Members train other members how to go on job 
interviews, network with prospective employees or craft a resume. For the state 
Employment Development Department, which oversees the group, this is a low-cost 
way to tackle the heavy losses of aerospace and other highly skilled jobs in 
the area. For Peura and other members, the club helps them stay on top of the 
market -- and keep their spirits up as well.

TEACHER REASSIGNED DURING ABUSE INQUIRY 
</P>

<P>
 A Wilmington teacher has been removed from her fifth-grade classroom after a 
parent accused her of grabbing, shaking and scaring her daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Constance N. Scharff, who had been transferred to Fries Elementary School only 
three weeks ago, was reassigned with pay to the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's administrative office in Gardena on Friday, district spokesman Bill 
Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharff will remain in the office while the school district and the Los 
Angeles Police Department investigate claims by parent Rachael Diaz that 
Scharff violently shook her daughter by the arm twice and pulled her blouse 
down for "not paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 After her daughter told her of the incident, Diaz said, she went to school to 
confront Scharff. Diaz said the teacher turned on her when the parent told 
Scharff not to touch her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had me by my sweat shirt and was swinging my arm around. . . . It was in 
front of the whole class," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students, Diaz said, were also "physically and mentally abused" by 
Scharff. "These kids didn't have respect for her. They had fear for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Scharff could not be contacted for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 But Fries Elementary Principal Nancy Orozco said parental concerns were being 
"grossly exaggerated" by Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she had witnessed Scharff behaving inappropriately, Orozco said: "Not 
really. There were certain things on which I was working with her but certainly 
nothing that comes close to child abuse, either physical or mental." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said the school district also is investigating an incident at Normont 
Elementary School in Harbor City, where Scharff taught before being transferred 
to Fries Elementary.  
</P>
<P>
 "She evidently, in an argument with the principal, issued a death threat, and 
it was on that basis that she was transferred out of the school. So there's an 
investigation going on about that, as well as the child abuse allegations," 
Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student's father, Ernesto Orozco, said in an interview that his son 
came to him near tears and told him Scharff had grabbed him and scratched his 
arm. The nail marks are still on his son's arm, Orozco said. He did not file 
charges against the teacher because school officials removed her from the 
classroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said he expects the school district to conclude its investigation this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has received 163 abuse complaints against teachers since June 1. 
Rivera said 126 were complaints of physical abuse and 90% of all complaints 
were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has about 34,000 teachers.

St., Torrance. (310) 375-1400. Open Monday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.,

 When Hank Damavandi moved to California in 1967, armed with a bachelor's 
degree from the University of Wisconsin, he discovered he couldn't land a job. 
So he flew in his secret weapon: his grandmother from Sicily.  
</P>
<P>
 Grandma Damavandi had owned restaurants in Palermo, and her savvy helped him 
with Hank's Pizza, a tiny joint he opened on a dilapidated stretch of Imperial 
Highway near La Cienega. It became a favorite haunt of aerospace workers in the 
vicinity. The construction of the Century Freeway put an end to that Hank's in 
1987, but by then, Damavandi had opened a new, much larger Hank's Pizza in 
Torrance, which continues to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with the Spartan original might be stunned to see the new 
Hank's. Outside the entrance is a neatly maintained plot of roses, pansies and 
marigolds. Inside, the dining room is warmly decorated with wood paneling and 
rugs. A large, pleasant patio has climbing vines and a fresco depicting the 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the name, the dining highlight at Hank's Pizza is the impressive salad 
bar. For $6.25, this all-you-can-eat affair is like taking a lesson in 
tropical-fruit appreciation. Among the offerings: passion fruit, with dark 
purple skin, creamy, mustard-colored sweet-tart flesh and edible black seeds; 
cherimoya -- a large green oval with a custard-like flesh reminiscent of 
pineapples and mangoes; pepino -- a New Zealand fruit that tastes of melons; 
feijoa, with a strawberry-like taste. And that's not even mentioning blood 
oranges, honey tangerines, papayas, mangoes, kiwi fruit, dates and figs.  
</P>
<P>
 Apart from that salad bar, Hank's offers Mussolini grande, ($7.95), a 
casserole of sausage, meatballs, bell peppers and mushrooms, covered with 
mozzarella and baked.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the pizza, Hank's version is loaded with whole milk mozzarella and 
topped with old-time favorites: sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms. One doubts that 
Grandma Damavandi would stand for pizza with Thai chicken or smoked salmon. 
MICHAEL KRIKORIAN Hank's Pizza is off Hawthorne Boulevard at 3760 W. 242nd St., 
Torrance. (310) 375-1400. Open Monday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.,

<P>
 Redondo sophomore Kerry Martin has pitched some outstanding games in her high 
school softball career, but Tuesday's was perhaps the best. 
</P>
<P>
 With darkness threatening to suspend play, host Redondo scored a run on an 
error in the bottom of the 17th inning to defeat Woodbridge of Irvine, 1-0, in 
the second round of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin (20-4) went the distance in the nearly four-hour game, giving up five 
hits and striking out 16. Selena Fine scored from third with two outs in the 
17th on an errant throw by the Woodbridge first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo will play host to California of Whittier in the quarterfinals at 3 
p.m. today. MOVING ON 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo's baseball team will play at Gahr of Cerritos and West Torrance will 
play host to Antelope Valley in Southern Section quarterfinal-round games at 3 
p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo advanced in the Division II playoffs with a 4-1 victory Tuesday over 
Buena of Ventura. Senior right-hander Scott Albin (11-0) pitched the final 2 
1/3 innings, shutting out Buena on three hits in relief of sophomore Ian 
Herweg, to gain his second victory of the playoffs and improve his three-year 
varsity record to 23-3. Albin is expected to start Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 West parlayed the pitching of David Delgado and a 14-hit attack into a 10-3 
Division III victory over host Jurapa Valley. Delgado (7-1), a left-handed 
junior, gave up seven hits in going the distance. His only loss was to Simi 
Valley early in the season. NOT AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive season, a 20-victory El Segundo High baseball team 
has lost early in the Southern Section playoffs to a dominant pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, La Serna's Jason LeBlanc pitched a five-hitter in a 5-4 second-round 
upset over top-seeded El Segundo. Last season, El Rancho left-hander Randy 
Flores gave up three hits and struck out 13 in a 3-2 first-round victory over 
the fourth-seeded Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more of the same Friday. Palmdale left-hander David Glick left El 
Segundo hitters frozen in their tracks, pitching a three-hitter and striking 
out 17 in a 5-1 victory in a Division III first-round game. The Eagles were 
caught looking on eight of Glick's strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just threw the ball right by us," El Segundo Coach John Stevenson said. 
"He liked to come inside on our hitters, which makes it tough. I think our guys 
probably should have gotten off the plate a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's performance was nothing new for Glick, who is expected to be a 
high-round draft pick. The victory left him with an 11-2 record, 10 complete 
games, a 1.36 earned-run average, 129 strikeouts and only 19 walks in 72 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't surprise Stevenson if Glick excelled at the next level, the way 
LeBlanc and Flores have at Pepperdine and USC, respectively. Flores (10-1) has 
become USC's No. 1 starter as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like somebody is looking out for us, in the wrong way," Stevenson 
said of his team's playoff draws. "I know that isn't true, but it almost seems 
like it. How can you be so unlucky? You can go through the playoffs without 
ever seeing those types of (pitchers)." MORE TOUGH LUCK 
</P>
<P>
 As bad as things have gone for El Segundo in the playoffs, the Eagles have a 
way to go to match the frustration endured by Bishop Montgomery this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (7-17-1) lost 11 one-run games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to keep the sharp objects away from me," Coach Rudy Garbalosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' inability to win close games detracted from an otherwise 
impressive season by pitcher Eric Fuller. The senior right-hander was 4-4 with 
a 1.38 earned-run average and was named Mission League pitcher of the year for 
a team that tied for sixth in an eight-team league. All of his losses were by a 
run in low-scoring games. RETURN TO FORM 
</P>
<P>
 Serra High, which won three Southern Section boys' track titles from 1980 to 
1982, is back on top after winning the Division IV title Saturday at Veterans 
Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers scored 84 points, the most of any division champion, and got 
victories from Rod Smith in the 100 meters, Ricky Boyer in the 200, Cardell 
Overstreet in the 110 high hurdles, and Dion Tobias in the 300 intermediate 
hurdles and the 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Morningside, meanwhile, continued its dominance in Division III by winning the 
boys' and girls' titles. It was the fifth consecutive title for the girls, led 
by Felicia Williams' victories in the 100 and 200; and the third consecutive 
title for the boys, led by sprinters William Taylor, LaMar Reed and Ray Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Also winning Division III titles were Phil Fonua of Mira Costa in the shotput 
and Martin Haynes of Bishop Montgomery in the 300 intermediate hurdles. 
SWATTING THE IVY 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mira Costa standout Greg Gilmer has become the first Dartmouth baseball 
player in 48 years to win the Ivy League batting title. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmer, a sophomore who played catcher and outfield, batted .476 (30 for 63) 
in 20 Ivy games to become only the third player in Dartmouth history and the 
first since 1946 to lead the league in batting. He batted .403 in all games, 
best on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmer posted those numbers despite playing the last 12 games with a broken 
little finger on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season, Gilmer and former Chadwick standout Todd Seneker were voted 
co-captains for the 1995 season by their teammates. KING OF THE COURT 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo High senior Matt Roghair extended an impressive unbeaten streak 
Saturday by advancing to the singles quarterfinals of the Southern Section 
individual tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Roghair received a bye and won two matches at Diamond Bar High, improving his 
record to 53-0 in sets played this season. Dennis Chang of Peninsula also 
reached the round of 16. The quarterfinals will be played Friday, with the 
semifinals and final Saturday at Seacliff Country Club in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Coach Jim Ball said Roghair, who was the Ocean League champion and 
most valuable player, is the first Sea Hawk to rise to the top ranking among 
boys' tennis players in the South Bay. END OF THE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 The season came to a disappointing end last weekend for the Harbor College 
baseball team, which failed to win a game in the Southern California regional 
finals for the second consecutive year. The Seahawks (31-14) lost to Rancho 
Santiago, 2-0, and Citrus, 10-8, in the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending state champion Rancho Santiago won the regional and will join three 
other teams, including Cypress, in the state finals beginning Saturday at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bright note for Harbor, catcher Jeff Poor played for the first time in 
two weeks and delivered a pinch-hit double Saturday against Citrus. Poor had 
been out of the lineup after he was stabbed at a party May 7. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * The South Torrance High boys' volleyball team reached the semifinals of the 
Southern Section playoffs for the first time in school history by beating 
Esperanza, 15-12, 15-7, 15-13, Friday behind 14 kills by Steve Rhodes and 11 
kills by Rob Spencer. The Spartans met second-seeded Royal in a Division II 
semifinal Wednesday night at Mira Costa. The winner advances to the final at 5 
p.m. Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harbor College guard LaTasha Burnett, the state's leading scorer with a 
28-point average, has announced she will attend USC. The 5-foot-5 Burnett led 
Harbor to its first state title in women's basketball last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Harris, a reserve point guard for Loyola Marymount, is considering 
transferring to another school, according to reports. Harris played behind 
another freshman, Jimmy Williamson, last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal State Dominguez Hills, which tied for the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. baseball title before it was eliminated in the NCAA Division II regional 
last week, received two of three major conference awards. Senior right-hander 
Bert Horn was selected pitcher of the year and George Wing was named coach of 
the year. In addition, the Toros placed pitcher Scott Veeder and outfielder 
Eric Martin on the first team, and pitcher Tony Velasquez on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anthony Napolitano of the Loyola Marymount baseball team and Judey Petix of 
the Lion softball team have been selected for the second straight year to the 
GTE Academic All-District VIII team, representing the West Coast. Napolitano, a 
senior first baseman who led Loyola with a .344 batting average and 23 doubles, 
has a 3.61 grade-point average. Petix, a junior outfielder who batted .287, has 
a 3.47 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard McFoy, a 6-8 center from state runner-up Ventura College, has signed 
a letter of intent to play basketball for Cal State Dominguez Hills. ROB FERNAS

SUPERVISOR DEFENDS VOTE TO RESTRICT DAY LABORERS; GOVERNMENT: BURKE SAYS 
TRAFFIC AND SANITATION WERE THE ISSUES, NOT CIVIL RIGHTS. MOLINA CALLS HER 
ACTION 'SHAMEFUL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's said that all politics are local. 
</P>
<P>
 And the maxim was proved again this week, as Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a lifelong liberal and civil rights advocate, provided 
the swing vote to approve a controversial ordinance to limit day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting the pleas of civil rights groups, Burke said that when push comes to 
shove, you have to do what is right for your constituents. "Obviously, when 300 
people in your community turn out, you have to listen," Burke said in an 
interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke joined conservative Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana to 
approve the measure characterized by opponents as anti-immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, who opposed the measure, called the vote "shameful" 
because the ordinance would be used "especially against people of color." 
Supervisor Ed Edelman was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burke said traffic and sanitation were the issues at stake in the day 
laborer vote, not race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been played as a race issue. It's not a race issue, it's not a civil 
rights issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept asking myself, if it was 50 black or 50 white (workers), would it have 
been the same issue?" Burke said. "I can assure you, it would be no different." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue concerns day laborers who solicit work at the curb, often near 
hardware and paint stores in the county. The ordinance, which goes into effect 
in all unincorporated areas of the county in July, makes curbside job-seeking a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
Proponents of the new ordinance say such curbside soliciting creates traffic 
and sanitation problems and encourages illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke first brought the ordinance to the board in March after receiving 
complaints from constituents in the Ladera Heights area of her central Los 
Angeles district. At the time, a watered-down version of the ordinance was 
adopted as all sides attempted to work on a compromise. But negotiations to 
establish an approved work pick-up site failed, and Burke's original motion was 
reintroduced by Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said the Ladera Heights community, in seeking to limit the activities of 
day laborers, is not racist and is not seeking to discriminate against any 
segment of population. The integrated, middle-class neighborhood is 
predominantly black but also has sizable white, Latino and Jewish populations 
that Burke said were all in favor of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she noted, the community is overwhelmingly Democratic and steadfastly 
liberal. "I'd put Ladera Heights' reputation (as liberal) against any 
neighborhood in Los Angeles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said that the liberal and conservative labels tend to fade when issues 
are localized. "People tend to vote their district and community," regardless 
of ideology, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of voting can create some odd alliances on the board, as evidenced 
by Tuesday's vote on the day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Board of Supervisors is said to be dominated by a liberal majority, 
which includes Burke, in fact all five members cross partisan lines routinely. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said some issues, such as health, are determined largely by 
liberal/conservative ideology. But others, such as support of law enforcement, 
which traditionally was a conservative cause, now draw the unanimous support of 
liberals and conservatives alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke also pointed out that this is not the first time she has been at odds 
with groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposed the day 
laborer restrictions. Burke said she disagrees with the ACLU on issues such as 
constitutional protections for pornography.

 In the blink of an eye, the Norman family doubled in size Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four orphaned Russian girls stepped shyly from an airliner at Los Angeles 
International Airport, embraced their new mother for the first time and set off 
for a new life in La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're home," Patti Norman said quietly as she gazed at her daughters for the 
first time. The girls smiled and then, one by one, reached up to clutch her 
hands tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters -- 5-year-old twins Ashley Olga and Amy Svetlana, 7-year-old 
Stethanie Irina and 9-year-old Lindsey Raya -- are from Ledanye Pole, a tiny 
village 250 miles north of St. Petersburg. They have been adopted by Patti and 
Mike Norman, already the adoptive parents of two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Norman, 41, a manager for a television network, traveled to Russia three 
weeks ago to pick up the four girls while his wife stayed behind with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 While 32-year-old Patti Norman waited, she finished outfitting the girls' two 
new bunk beds with Snow White coverings. And she practiced learning how to 
phonetically say phrases like "it's time to brush your teeth now" in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't speak English and we don't speak Russian," she said. "But I think 
we're prepared. There's an international language called love." 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual adoption got its start when the Normans saw a television program 
two years ago about Romanian orphanages. From the lawyer who had helped with 
their earlier adoptions in this country of Timothy, 2 1/2, and Andrew, 22 
months, the couple learned that Russian orphans were also looking for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Paperwork, home-visit inspections and other requirements of international 
adoptions took months after attorney Ron Stoddart of Brea put the Normans in 
contact last fall with a group searching for a home for the four sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Normans decided to adopt the girls, they called British Airways in 
search of cheap tickets. Impressed, the airline offered to fly Mike Norman and 
mother-in-law Gwen Erwin to Russia and fly them and the girls home for free. 
The airline tossed in a stopover in London and an expense-paid shopping spree 
for the wide-eyed girls at a major toy store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called from the orphanage before they left and said, 'Hi Mama!' " Patti 
Norman said as she awaited their arrival Wednesday afternoon. "I've only seen 
one color photocopy of a picture of them. But they had such sweet little 
voices." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman said his wife had made the girls tiny backpacks filled with crayons, 
Barbie dolls and rag dolls, necklaces and bracelets and photo books of the 
sisters' new family. But there were tears when the girls left the orphanage 
where they had lived for two years, since being abandoned by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 It took several weeks in Russia for Norman to get all the approvals needed to 
take the girls out of the country. At first, the girls were shy around him 
because there are no men at the orphanage, he said. "The second day we came 
back, Irina jumped up and down and yelled in Russian, 'Papa, papa, you've come 
back just like you said you would,' " Norman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman left the village with the children on Friday. During the last few days 
of traveling they have gotten to know each other, he said. "Everything they do, 
they are doing for the first time. They rode their first elevator yesterday -- 
we rode it for 20 minutes. Children in America have so much that these girls 
have not had." 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans said the girls will be enrolled in public schools this fall in 
their suburban neighborhood 20 miles southeast of Downtown Los Angeles. Before 
that, they will be immersed in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it will be hard, but they'll pick up on things quickly. The boys are 
at a stage where they're learning words, too. Everybody will be learning 
together," Patti Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the cheat sheet with phrases spelled out phonetically that someone 
with an adopted Russian child passed on to us. We have some Russian-speaking 
friends. I think we're prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Young Timothy has already begun including his new sisters in his nighttime 
prayers. "He can name them by name," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their little nightgowns are hung up and ready to jump into. Their dollhouse 
is there. Their clothes are ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly a large family, the Normans walked out of the airport terminal hand 
in hand. The girls had been welcomed with flowers and balloons by about 150 
friends from the Normans' Whittier Hills Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not special. This is what God has chosen for us," Patti Norman 
whispered. "We're blessed."

UCLA TO FIRE TOP MANAGER LINKED TO FRAUD PROBE; INVESTIGATION: AUDIT SHOWS A 
RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATOR APPROVED $1.2 MILLION IN EXCESSIVE FEES. BUT 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MONEY WENT TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA announced Wednesday that it will fire a top administrator in its 
department of radiological sciences for approving at least $1.2 million in 
"inappropriate" and excessive payments to temporary employment registries with 
which he had hidden business ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said an internal audit, which has been conducted with the FBI, 
revealed that James G. Campbell, the radiology department's former 
administrative officer, authorized payments for at least three temporary 
employees who could not have performed the work claimed by the outside 
employment firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell also approved some payments for employees from those registries -- 
Radiology Registry Agency Inc. and 21st Services Corp. -- who did perform the 
work but were paid at twice the regular rate, UCLA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the alleged scheme defrauded UCLA Medical Center and the nearby West 
Los Angeles Veterans Administration hospital of $1.2 million to $1.3 million -- 
the largest fraud ever at the medical school -- but there isn't any evidence 
that money went to Campbell personally, said Raymond Eden, dean of the UCLA 
School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have found that Campbell had a "close relationship with the 
registries," although his name does not appear on any corporate records, Eden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some evidence that they met together, that there were meetings 
between the two registries and Mr. Campbell, mostly dinner or luncheon 
meetings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell could not be reached for comment Wednesday. In a short interview with 
The Times recently, he acknowledged having been contacted by an FBI agent 
investigating alleged fraud in the radiological sciences department. 
</P>
<P>
 As the top administrator, Campbell was paid more than $91,000 a year and had 
control of planning and operations, including final approval on payments to 
registries. These are specialized employment services that provide temporary 
help, such as X-ray technicians, to cover for vacations, leaves and periods of 
peak demand for radiological services. 
</P>
<P>
 The radiological sciences department performs X-rays, bone scans, magnetic 
resonance imaging and other procedures for the UCLA Medical Center and, on 
occasion, for the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. It 
has an annual budget of $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's position was eliminated and he was placed on paid leave March 30, 
UCLA officials said. The leave was scheduled to expire June 5, when Campbell 
would be let go but remain eligible to collect another six months pay as 
severance, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials had previously maintained that Campbell was terminated 
because of administrative restructuring. On Wednesday, however, they informed 
him about the evidence uncovered by auditors and said they were terminating him 
"with cause," a move that would force him to forfeit the severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into the radiological sciences department began in October, 
1992. It intensified after Dr. Richard J. Steckel became chairman of the 
radiology department Jan. 1, in part because of rumors about Campbell's alleged 
role in the improper payments, Eden said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, school officials informed federal authorities about the probe 
because some of the questionable payments were made with federal funds used to 
pay for radiological services at the VA hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in April that the FBI was investigating allegations of 
embezzlement by a department employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Eden said it appears the fraud may have "gone on from July of 1990 until 
recently." The department has used Radiology Registry Agency since then and 
added 21st Services Corp. in July 1992. Overall, the registries have been paid 
$5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the probe has uncovered one case in which a man listed on a registry 
invoice as a radiologist is actually a dentist, so he could not have performed 
the services approved by Campbell, Eden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was another person who was a Ph.D who was listed as a physician, and he 
couldn't provide radiological services," he added. "There were also some 
charges for radiological technologists that were excessive charges, that 
shouldn't have happened. . . . We're looking at as much as twice the rate that 
you usually pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate records do not show Campbell as an officer of either registry, but 
the files of fictitious business names recorded with Los Angeles County list 
Campbell as having a business relationship with Stephen P. Walta, an official 
of Radiology Registry Agency Inc. Walta and Campbell are co-owners of a firm 
called CRE of Southern California, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
 Eden said Wednesday that UCLA was unaware of that connection. He said that 
Walta manages the other registry, 21st Services Corp., and UCLA records show he 
is being paid nearly $23 an hour as an administrative assistant at the VA 
hospital and was hired through a third registry that has not been implicated by 
the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at work recently, Walta declined to comment on his business or the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Steckel announced Wednesday that the department would stop using the two 
registries in question and officials said the probe was continuing.

PROTEST SEEKS TO FLUSH OUT TOILET ISSUE; HOMELESS: BLOCKADE OF CITY HALL 
BATHROOM IS PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO GET LATRINES FOR SKID ROW. AN AGREEMENT MAY 
BE NEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This was a protest aimed at making City Hall squirm. And it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to pressure the city of Los Angeles into installing portable toilets 
for the homeless people on Skid Row, a small band of demonstrators staged a 
blockade of a City Hall men's room on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Their point: Those with roofs over their heads sometimes take accessible 
toilets for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been asking City Hall since 1980 to put toilets on Skid Row," said 
Alice Callahan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo. "Thousands of people have 
no place other than alleys, sideways and doorways to go to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Toilets were set to go up in 1992 but then Mayor Tom Bradley interceded to 
keep them off sidewalks. For months, activists have been pressuring Mayor 
Richard Riordan to approve the latrines. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wednesday's bathroom blockade was in full swing, a Riordan representative 
huddled with Councilwoman Rita Walters and other city leaders to hash out an 
agreement that could bring toilets to Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 If county health permits are secured and the legal issues are resolved, 33 
sidewalk toilets would go up at a cost of about $77,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of bathroom facilities in the city's giant municipal edifice. 
But the four-hour shutdown of the second-floor men's room, which is City Hall's 
main public facility, did prompt a little frantic searching. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden complained that the protesters chose the bathroom 
across from his office for their blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to block me when I have to go," Holden said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SHERIFF BLOCK ASSAILS FIVE OPPONENTS AS UNQUALIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block, bidding for a fourth term in the June 7 primary, 
disparaged his five opponents Wednesday, saying he believes that "probably 
several hundred" of his deputies have better qualifications to be sheriff than 
any of his foes. The qualifications of all his opponents, even if combined, 
would not be equal to the requirements of being sheriff if the Board of 
Supervisors was appointing one, Block contended at his monthly news conference, 
the last before the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff rebutted the charge by one of three sheriff's deputies opposing 
him, Sgt. John Stites, that he was "grandstanding in an election year" when he 
publicly discussed the case against two firefighters suspected of starting last 
fall's Calabasas/Malibu wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the district attorney thought enough of the investigation to take 
the case to the grand jury and what their ultimate decision will be, I can't 
predict," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for reports that another opponent, reserve Sheriff's Capt. Robert Irmas, is 
about to launch a television blitz against him, Block said he does not have 
enough in campaign funds to have any television spots of his own and doesn't 
plan to try to raise any such funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Block will face a November runoff with his leading opponent if he fails to get 
a majority of all the votes cast in the primary.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING JURY 
ASKS HOW TO FILL OUT VERDICT FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury in its seventh day of deliberations asked the judge Wednesday to 
explain the procedure for filling out complicated verdict forms in the punitive 
damages phase of Rodney G. King's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, however, did not presage an immediate verdict.The panel retired 
Wednesday afternoon with no announcements after 43 1/2 hours of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John Davies told the panel to fill out each of the seven 
forms as verdicts are reached and save them until all are completed. The 
panelists were confused about whether they should return verdicts one by one 
for each of six current and former police officers remaining as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are six defendants, the jury must reach seven verdicts because 
one former officer, Theodore J. Briseno, has countersued King, charging that 
King shoved him in the chest moments before King's March 3, 1991, beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury already has awarded King $3.8 million in actual damages from the city 
of Los Angeles.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE; MAN PARKED 
OUTSIDE LIQUOR STORE IS SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Wednesday were investigating the fatal shooting of a man in the 
Venice community of Oakwood, the second shooting in the area in the last four 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold McDaniel, a 33-year-old Venice resident, was sitting in his car outside 
a liquor store about 6 p.m. Tuesday when he was approached by two men, one of 
whom fired several rounds, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said McDaniel was hit in the torso and died at the scene. One of the 
assailants was wearing a bandanna over his face and the other was wearing a ski 
cap, police said. Both fled in a yellow Chevrolet Impala. 
</P>
<P>
 "No warning or comments were given before the shooting," said Los Angeles 
Police Detective Mike DePasquale. Police said no suspects have been taken into 
custody and the case remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, 22-year-old Juan Ramiro was shot outside his Venice 
residence. He remains in fair condition and is awaiting surgery for a gunshot 
wound to his arm. Authorities, who have made no arrests in the case, declined 
to identify the hospital where he is being treated, citing safety concerns. 
</P>

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY SEEKS 
TO REVOKE LICENSE OF CHARITY FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city of Los Angeles watchdog agency took steps Wednesday to revoke the 
license of a charitable fund-raising business that was the subject of a Times 
story disclosing that it cashed checks for charities that do not exist and real 
charities that it did not represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Burns, general manager of the Los Angeles Social Service Department, 
said he began the revocation process after Thomas Galambos, president and owner 
of Valley Fundraisers, failed to comply with the city's order to produce the 
firm's records. 
</P>
<P>
 A notice delivered to Galambos and his attorney, Elliott Kajan, said the 
license, which allows Galambos to conduct a commercial enterprise raising funds 
for charities, would be revoked June 6 if he does not request a hearing before 
the Social Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Revocation of the license would prohibit Galambos from soliciting funds on 
behalf of any charities in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kajan declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Fundraisers' headquarters, on Alameda Avenue in Burbank, closed 
shortly after The Times story appeared, and its phone was disconnected.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEACH 'GRADES' IMPROVE 
FOR 2ND YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica Bay has improved as a place to swim for the second year in a row, 
according to a report to be released today by a local environmental group that 
monitors the bay's water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are by far more places that are clean than places people should avoid," 
said Roger Gorke, science and policy analyst for Heal the Bay, a nonprofit 
organization that promotes the health and safety of area beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's annual report card of beaches between Malibu and the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula -- the only comprehensive review of water quality at Los Angeles 
County beaches -- is the most optimistic since the group began grading the 
beaches four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite overall improvement, however, its authors cautioned against reading 
too much into the report, saying that more needs to be known about the human 
health risks of contaminants in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't meant to suggest that the bay isn't polluted," Gorke said. "It 
tells us that the worst problems are concentrated in relatively small areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The report cites major improvements at several beaches, including the area 
near the Redondo Pier and Mother's Beach at Marina del Rey, previously regarded 
as among the most polluted in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also gloomy spots. 
</P>
<P>
 In its grading scheme from A to F, the group singled out the beach at the 
mouth of Ballona Creek as the "class troublemaker," saying the storm drain 
continues to be the largest single source of pollution in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 And it takes a swipe at Los Angeles officials for having discontinued their 
regular monitoring of pollution levels there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City sanitation officials announced in July that as a practical matter in 
trying to detect sewage spills into the creek, they would no longer monitor 
pollutants at the Pacific Avenue Bridge -- where the creek empties into the 
ocean -- in favor of a sampling site a mile up the creek at Centinela 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The report questions the decision, decrying the fact that there is no longer a 
sampling site at the bay's most notorious pollution point, where people swim, 
fish, use Jet Skis and row crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heal the Bay report also cites two popular state beaches -- Malibu Lagoon 
and Will Rogers -- as among the most contaminated areas in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas that show relatively high levels of so-called indicator bacteria 
-- total coliform, fecal coliform and enterococcus -- include the Santa Monica 
Pier and Cabrillo Beach in Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach pollution in the county is largely the result of urban runoff -- an 
accumulation of domestic and commercial waste dumped or inadvertently washed 
into storm drains and swept into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollutants include pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, animal waste, oil from 
leaking cars and many other contaminants that make their way into gutters and 
eventually end up in the ocean -- especially during rainy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 In compiling the report, Heal the Bay used data collected by the Los Angeles 
Bureau of Sanitation and the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
It makes separate water-quality analyses for dry days -- which account for 
about 300 days of the year -- and rainy days. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the improved water conditions, the environmental group said that 
bathers should still take precautions when they go into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should never enter the water during a rainstorm, and should wait at 
least three days after the storm has ended before going into the bay," Gorke 
said. Bay Watch These are grades given by Heal the Bay in its report card for 
dry weather. Bathers are warned to stay away from storm drainsf and piers and 
not to swim for three days after a rain. An "A" grade would indicate the 
cleanest sectors of the bay, "F" areas should be avoided. Heal the Bay uses 
data collected by the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation and the county 
Department of Health Services. Water Testing locations Point Dume Mailbu

MTA TO BUY 42 MORE SUBWAY CARS IN ITALY; TRANSPORTATION: CRITICS ARGUED FOR 
ADDITIONAL BIDS. BUT AGENCY OFFICIALS SAY THEY CAN BUY NEW VEHICLES AT OLD 
PRICES UNDER DEAL WITH FIRM THAT MADE CURRENT FLEET. 
</P>

<P>
 The cash-strapped Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed to pay an 
Italian manufacturer $80 million for 42 Red Line cars Wednesday, despite some 
objections that cheaper and better-quality cars might be found through a wider 
bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA directors voted 10 to 1 to buy the new subway cars from Breda Costruzioni 
Ferroviarie, the firm that provided the Red Line's current fleet of 30 
vehicles. An option on the original contract allows the agency to buy the cars 
at nearly the same price as before, about $1.6 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 But some officials criticized the decision, saying that putting the contract 
out to bid would be a fairer method and could produce a better deal for an 
agency struggling to close a $126-million operating budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can always exercise the (Breda) option," alternate director Nick 
Patsaouras said. "The issue is fair play." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said that Breda-made cars on the 
4.4-mile Red Line have shown excessive wheel wear far earlier than expected. 
"What's it worth with the problems they've come up with?" asked Antonovich, who 
cast the dissenting vote in Wednesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA planners recommended that the agency stick with the Italian concern 
because it is a known quantity. Using the same manufacturer would result in 
significant savings by keeping the subway project on schedule, eliminating the 
need for a stockpile of spare parts for another brand of car and locking in the 
original price, a staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said current market prices could push costs past the Breda offer by 
about $280,000 per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly come out ahead," said MTA Director Evan Braude, a member of the 
Long Beach City Council. "We're buying new cars at old car prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also say that upgrading the quality of steel and other adjustments 
would improve the durability of the wheels on the new cars. In the present 
fleet, some wheels, which were made with low-grade steel, have worn out after 
only 3,000 miles, although their life span is supposed to be about 100,000 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners said the contract option approved Wednesday would have expired in a 
month, adding to the urgency of exercising that option now. But Patsaouras 
accused the MTA staff of putting off the issue until time constraints dictated 
choosing Breda. 
</P>
<P>
 With the order of 42 new cars, the value of the original contract increases to 
$135 million for Breda, based in Pistoia, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, transportation officials came under fire for tapping a Japanese 
company to provide 41 cars for the Green Line light-rail system. The contract 
was eventually canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 For the new Red Line purchase, MTA officials said U.S. involvement will 
account for at least half of the work. Final assembly of the cars will be in 
New Jersey. No local firms are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no rail companies here in Southern California," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
 In unrelated action, the MTA put off a discussion of next year's budget, which 
was to be presented Wednesday. Officials said it was not ready.

AUDIT URGES DWP TO REDUCE STAFF BY ONE-FOURTH; UTILITIES: AGENCY MUST MAKE 
DRAMATIC CUTS IF IT HOPES TO COMPETE WITH PRIVATE FIRMS AFTER DEREGULATION, 
CITY OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An audit released Wednesday proposed that the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power cut its staff by up to a quarter, or 2,900 employees, to save as much 
as $223 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 With deregulation of the power industry looming, the DWP must make the 
dramatic staff cuts if it hopes to compete with private utilities, city 
officials said. The savings are also needed to help pay for the city's ongoing 
expansion of the Police Department, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials were nearly gleeful about the prospect of scaling back 
an agency they have long bashed as wasteful, they were also wary about the many 
competing demands on the DWP, the largest municipally owned utility in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who helped present the audit to DWP officials 
Wednesday, summed it up this way: "What we are trying to do is reduce costs to 
the bone, continue our social and environmental policies, keep residential 
electric rates down, decrease industrial rates to be more competitive and still 
have money to transfer to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do all those things, so you have to make some tough choices." 
</P>
<P>
 The question of what choices to make will have to wait, while the city 
attempts to implement the recommendations from the Barrington-Wellesley Group, 
a New Hampshire-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm was hired late last year by the City Council, which had been outraged 
by reports that the DWP had spent more than $800,000 on catered food around the 
time of a nine-day strike by employees. The utility's managers had previously 
been chastised for expensive charter airline flights and excessive contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The auditing firm compared the DWP to other utilities and found that it 
generally charged customers lower rates, but that its expenses were high. The 
firm concluded that 2,300 to 2,900 employees should be cut from the 
11,627-person work force to bring it in line with private utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The report suggests that the cuts can be made over five years, without 
layoffs, through attrition and early-retirement incentives. The nearly 1,400 
full-time engineers and support employees who handle repairs and additions to 
the electric system could be replaced by as few as 313 employees, the report 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 The division responsible for power distribution has too many managers and 
restricts employees' duties too strictly by job classifications, the audit 
found. It also concluded that the utility has too many clerks, drivers, 
maintenance workers, and employees who manage phone and computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the excess of employees, the DWP has been able to sustain relatively 
low rates because it receives tax benefits that private utilities do not, the 
audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found residential power rates were 17% lower for DWP customers than 
those of other big-city utilities. The DWP reported that a typical residential 
customer who is billed $99 a month would pay nearly $126 to Southern California 
Edison, which serves most surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP is also lower than neighboring Edison for industrial customers, but 5% 
higher when compared with utilities in other urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are worried that they must cut industrial rates to keep 
manufacturing customers. Some are already fleeing the DWP system. UCLA, for 
example, recently opened its own power station, cutting $15 million from DWP's 
annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Utilities Commission has proposed deregulating the power 
industry starting in 1996. Deregulation would allow large industrial users to 
shop for bargains. The loss of industrial users could trigger what some DWP 
managers refer to as the "death spiral." 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we are going to have to compete and if we don't, we are going to lose 
our industrial customers," said Dennis Tito, president of the DWP board. "Then 
our residential rates will go up higher than our competitors'. If that happens, 
voters will demand the utility be sold." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also worried that being thrown into a competition with private 
utilities could hurt fledgling conservation and environmental efforts -- the 
purchase of electric cars, tree plantings and retrofitting to create 
cleaner-burning power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the rawest form of competition, any social and environmental costs would 
have to be pulled out, otherwise you could not compete," said Ron Deaton, the 
city's chief legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives said they welcomed the calls for reduced management at 
the DWP but that they doubt that the recommended use of outside contractors 
would save money.

MAGNITUDE 4.5 AFTERSHOCK IS A RUDE AWAKENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Los Angeles and Ventura county residents got a jarring wake-up call Wednesday 
morning when the largest aftershock to the Northridge earthquake in two months 
rattled the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the short 4.5-magnitude shaker was only powerful enough to break a 
few dishes and rattle some nerves, for many it was a grim reminder of the 
destructive pre-dawn Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like, 'Here we go again,' " said Shawn Rucker, 24, of San Fernando. At 
his house, picture frames and plants fell and several glasses broke in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a train going through my house," he said. "I expected it to go on 
like the Jan. 17 earthquake, then it just stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5:56 a.m. temblor, which shook for as long as 15 seconds in parts of the 
San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, was centered three miles northeast of San 
Fernando. It was felt throughout the area and as far north as Camarillo in 
Ventura County. Caltech seismologists said it also was felt on Santa Catalina 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the day, smaller aftershocks struck the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the more emotional people were just starting to relax," said Kate 
Hutton at Caltech. "This was a pretty good feeler. It's the nature of nature, 
and we can't do much about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As jarring as the aftershock was, scientists said it was not only normal, but 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucile M. Jones, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist, said a computer 
analysis predicted that the area would get four aftershocks of at least 
magnitude 4 between March 20 -- the date of the last significant aftershock -- 
and Wednesday's temblor. Instead, there has been only this one, and it was a 
relatively minor one at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a little less than would have been expected," Jones said. "It is not 
very typical at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents a few miles from the epicenter were shaken particularly hard. At the 
Tahitian Mobile Home Park in Sylmar, where 64 trailers burned after the 
Northridge quake, the jolt renewed fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking that if it went on any longer, I would throw my body over my 
sons, and then it stopped," said Susan Rezvani, 37, standing with her two boys, 
Neema, 12, and Naveed, 4, outside a friend's trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Hofmann, 60, has lived in a motor home outside his Sylmar house since it 
was red-tagged after the Northridge quake. During Wednesday's temblor, he said, 
the trailer bounced up and down like a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the epicenter was here," Hofmann said. "Everybody started yelling 
and screaming, 'My God, not again!' " The only casualty in his makeshift home 
was a fax machine that fell from a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the damage also was minor. Cracks in the walls of homes not 
yet repaired from the January quake widened, chandeliers swung, dishes broke 
and frightened children hopped in bed with parents who could not get back to 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported electricity, water or phone service disruptions, and no 
freeway closures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 8,000 aftershocks since the Jan. 17 quake, about 400 have been felt. 
Seven aftershocks were between magnitude 5.0 and 6.0; about 40 were between 4.0 
and 5.0. More than 300 were between 3.0 and 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 20 aftershock, which was magnitude 5.3 and centered near Panorama 
City, sparked two fires in the San Fernando Valley, but caused no injuries.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; ANYONE WANT AN OUTFIELDER?

 Will anyone be chanting the name again? Will anyone be calling?

 "Our industry has always looked in different places and different ways to 
acquire players of talent, and he was once a talented player," Kansas City 
Royal General Manager Herk Robinson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has to do with his attitude and financial demands, but I'm sure he'll 
be scrutinized carefully and end up with another club if that's what he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's implication is that an industry quick to forgive and forget is 
likely to provide a market for Darryl Strawberry, soon to be a free agent after 
reaching a financial settlement with the Dodgers on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he pursue that market? 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert Shapiro said it is unlikely to happen in 1994 as Strawberry 
continues his rehabilitation from drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the players' union, said the 
33-year-old outfielder will definitely play again. 
</P>
<P>
 Where? When? 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't certain, but two clubs in the outfield market -- the Boston Red Sox 
and San Francisco Giants -- didn't rule out possible interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know enough about his situation to know if we'd have some interest in 
bringing him to the Red Sox, but we could use another hitter and I suspect 
we'll look into it," Red Sox General Manager Dan Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be interested in what his bat represents if he's at all the 
hitter he once was. He obviously needs to go out and play somewhere before 
anyone would bring him to the majors." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's back and drug problems have restricted him to 75 games in the 
last two-plus seasons. An interested club, however, could sign him for the 
minimum $109,000 a year through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox, hurting for outfield power, displayed interest in trading for 
Montreal Expo outfielder Larry Walker or signing another rehabilitating free 
agent, Ron Gant, even before designated hitter Andre Dawson was lost because of 
knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The inconsistently offensive Giants have also shown interest in Gant, but the 
former Atlanta Brave outfielder, recovering from a broken leg, will not be 
ready until after the All-Star break, and Giant General Manager Bob Quinn said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not closing the door, but until we can see (Gant) work out, there's no 
sense talking about it. His situation is six weeks premature." 
</P>
<P>
 And Strawberry? 
</P>
<P>
 "Dusty (Baker, the Giants' manager) has known Darryl since his high school 
days," Quinn said. "He feels strongly about him. I talked to Dusty about it and 
he said that he had seen on TV that Darryl isn't interested in playing in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Dusty's behalf, if that were to change, we'd have to be interested. If 
Darryl wants to play, I'd expect we'd at least listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Who else? The Toronto Blue Jays, maybe. The Baltimore Orioles, perhaps. The 
Chicago Cubs? 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be a terrific hitter in our park because he's a left-center to 
right-center power guy," Cub Manager Tom Trebelhorn said at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would not seriously consider him? Every club will take a serious look," 
Trebelhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not really. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado Rockies, who have the resources and ballpark, flatly ruled it 
out. So did the Houston Astros, who are contending in the National League's 
Central Division despite a vacancy in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd only be interested in the old Darryl Strawberry," Astro General Manager 
Bob Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive hungry Royals? "I'm not sure where I'd play him," Robinson said 
of a set lineup that includes outfielders Vince Coleman, Brian McRae and Felix 
Jose, plus designated hitter Bob Hamelin. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the market could change significantly if Strawberry waits until 
1995 to resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he wait? Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said he hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason, no sense, to sign just because he's a free agent. That 
would be a mistake," Claire said. "I mean, looking at him and talking to him, 
Darryl seems to be in outstanding physical condition, but emotionally he feels 
he's let a lot of people down and he wants to get his life and priorities right 
before he plays again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on his way in that regard, and that's the way it should be."

MIKE DOWNEY: RELEASE IS THE LAST STRAW FOR DARRYL AND DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wednesday morning at 10:30, Darryl Strawberry strode into the law offices of 
Latham & Watkins, 633 West 5th Street, downtown Los Angeles, in a baseball cap, 
neatly pressed T-shirt and shorts to be formally divorced from the Dodgers. He 
came in from his present dwelling near Palm Springs looking rested and fit, 
Fred Claire thought, finally getting to observe Strawberry face to face. Not 
once had the Dodger general manager seen or spoken to Strawberry since the 
player confessed his drug habit April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda was not in the room. Not once had the Dodger manager seen or 
spoken to Strawberry since the player went absent without leave April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't put my calls through, but I left messages," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said, "I would have, but I didn't even know where he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Around a conference table, five men sat. Claire brought along the baseball 
club's general counsel, Sam Fernandez. Strawberry had his own lawyer, Robert 
Shapiro, whose practice in Century City is situated on the ironically named 
Avenue of the Stars. Dapper in his double-breasted gray suit, Shapiro presented 
a stark contrast in style to his client and to the fifth party present, the 
players' union representative, Eugene Orza, dressed in argyle socks and tan 
suede shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Details already had been hammered out. Final points were discussed. Papers 
were drawn. Strawberry would relinquish the Dodgers from any contractual 
obligation they had in return for a financial settlement. The player's services 
would become available to any other organization willing to pay a price. Should 
no one stake a claim, Strawberry would be free to strike any deal with any 
team, any time he felt able. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry spoke and got emotional. He said, "I'm sorry that I let everybody 
down." He wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he signed the divorce papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire extended a hand and said, "Keep in touch." 
</P>
<P>
 "You too, Fred," Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he left L.A. for good. Out at home. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way back to Chavez Ravine to announce the news, Claire was conscious of 
everything that had transpired. After one fine 1991 season, he and the Dodgers 
had gotten next to nothing from Strawberry as a ballplayer and now would get 
nothing for him. And yet, at least something possibly had been saved in the 
process. Possibly Darryl Strawberry himself had been saved. He had gotten some 
help. He had checked into the Betty Ford clinic. Betty Ford herself had checked 
on him. To save his baseball career was one thing. Actual salvation meant more. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire had a vivid flashback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget going to Maury Wills' place in the Marina when we knew for 
sure he had a problem. Don Newcombe goes with me. Maury's denying, denying, 
denying. We go over there and bang on his door and we tell him he's going with 
us to an Orange County treatment center if Don has to drag him there. All the 
while, he's telling us to get the hell away from him, leave him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's ashamed. He doesn't want to be there. Remember, this is one of the most 
famous players in Dodger history. Maury's so nervous, he doesn't even register 
under his own name. He checks into the clinic as 'Don Claire.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, he gets better, thank God. And one morning Maury finally gets up 
in front of everybody and says, 'You know, my name's not really Don.' And the 
people there, they smile at him and say, you know, 'No kidding.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, all these years later, I'll be down in Vero Beach taking a jog 
around the grounds, and I'll look up and see Maury Wills out on the golf 
course. And he gives a little wave, and I give a little wave, and we don't have 
to speak. We know , we just know. Maury saved his life. Maury's my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegory is unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry is in the same boat. It's a lifeboat. He has to save 
himself, even if he feels all alone. For 52 days now, he has been on his own, 
maybe feeling humiliated, maybe feeling betrayed. Claire can hear those last 
conversations with Darryl as though they happened an hour ago. He had waited, 
then panicked, then even prayed for the player's safekeeping April 3 when the 
phone finally rang, late that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl calls and says, 'Don't worry, I'm fine, everything's all right.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I tell him, 'Like hell it is.' I tell him, 'You get your butt into my 
office first thing tomorrow morning and you bring your agent and bring your 
attorney and bring anybody you need to bring.' And that's when, next day, 
Darryl finally acknowledged that he had a serious, serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 An illness? 
</P>
<P>
 Many would call it that. Some would not. Lasorda did not. He deliberately 
called Strawberry's downfall a weakness, not a disease. People called the 
manager insensitive, ill-informed, but Lasorda remains adamant, saying 
Wednesday, "I've read probably 400 letters since I said that and I've kept 
them, and let me tell you, all but about three agreed with me 100%. I got 
letters from doctors, letters from former addicts, letters from preachers. I 
had a 12-year-old kid in Philadelphia tell me, 'Tommy, I'm happy you said what 
you said about Darryl. He ain't sick. He's weak. I got friends like him who are 
weak.' Twelve damn years old! Scares the hell out of you. 
</P>
<P>
 "People got to understand something. This is something kids have got to fight, 
this urge to use drugs. I ain't knocking Darryl. I'm praying for the guy. He's 
got a heart as big as his whole body. Now that he's on the right road, I'll 
call him and tell him that. But first he had to save himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he has. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire hopes so. He thinks about Strawberry a lot, thinks about why he 
came here in the first place. Clenching a fist, pounding the air, Claire stands 
inside the belly of Dodger Stadium and says, "This was where Darryl Strawberry 
wanted to be more than anyplace in the whole world. Darryl didn't go out and 
talk to 20 different teams. Darryl could have walked into those winter meetings 
as a free agent and people would have been tripping over themselves to get at 
him. Being a Dodger meant everything to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl thinks he let his whole hometown down. Can you imagine how that must 
feel? 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you my dream about Darryl. It's 15 years from now and we're at an 
old-timers' game. I wave to him down on the field and say, 'Darryl, how you 
doing?' And Darryl takes my hand and says, 'Fred, I'm doing great.' "

JIM MURRAY: NOW SIMON HAS QUALITY WITH QUANTITY AT INDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the romantic view of most auto race fans -- conditioned by years of 
Clark Gable and James Garner movies -- that the race driver is this dashing, 
swashbuckling character who straps himself into any old stock-block machine and 
streaks out for some hell-bent, wheel-to-wheel combat with a similarly 
boisterous cast of daredevils whom he beats by superior nerve and reckless 
courage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nice bit of mythology. Auto races might have been decided in Ray 
Harroun's or Barney Oldfield's day that way. But today, they're decided the 
same way most other things in life are -- on a computer screen. By a 
complicated system of science and engineering that doesn't eliminate the human 
element, just makes it secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 At 232 m.p.h., can you be said to be "driving" a vehicle -- or are you just 
hanging onto the back of a raging tiger? 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how good a rider he has on him, no burro is going to win a Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 And no driver is going to win Indianapolis in a bad car. 
</P>
<P>
 The wonder of Indy is not the high-powered teams that come in with their 
high-tech equipment, unlimited resources and cars that embody every automotive 
advantage Detroit or Stuttgart ever charted. 
</P>
<P>
 You get one of these engineering gems and put Nigel Mansell in it -- and just 
wait for him in Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 But how about the guys who start this thing every year with no real hope of 
winning -- the chorus line, so to speak, the spear carriers of Indy? There's no 
Indy without them, but they fire it up year after year, fill out the card in 
cars that are light years behind the star chassis in speed, reliability and 
endurance. They are the Don Quixotes of the roaring road, dreaming impossible 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Simon knows all about that side of Indy. Dick was a guy who was president 
of his own insurance company in Utah who couldn't resist the lure of racing. 
May after May he showed up in an underpowered, uncompetitive used car that 
served as traffic on race day. Dick, in effect, got in the Derby on a burro. 
Dick would start 33rd, 32nd, 31st, pilot his car to a middle-of-the-race 
finish. But no one would put him in a set-up commanded by Penske or Newman-Haas 
or any of the lords of the speedway. Dick's cars were put together by wrenches, 
not state-of-the-art computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, we'd hawk the barrels in front of the glamour garages, take the 
gear boxes out of 'em," Simon recalls. "We put 'em together with everything but 
chewing gum. But we got 'em in the race. Then, we got sponsors almost by going 
door to door like vacuum cleaner salesmen." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Dick Simons in the world, Indy is like a fickle seductive mistress. "I 
gave up a job, a marriage, a career to get in a race car," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people would say Indy destroyed him, but Simon couldn't live without it. 
Given the wheels under him, he was a very good driver. Once, he had a car that 
wouldn't even start. He started 33rd and finished 33rd. The miracle was he 
qualified the car at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But he learned Indy as you never could from a Mercedes-Benz proving ground or 
a Detroit boardroom. When he started as high as sixth (1987), he finished 
sixth. He was a quick, resourceful pilot of whom a competitor once said, "He 
drives five miles an hour faster than his car." 
</P>
<P>
 When he got too old to drive -- he'll be 61 this year -- the thought of 
leaving Indy never occurred to Dick Simon. He would simply be on the other side 
of the pit. He began pasting together a team instead of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Simon has more cars in this year's Indy 500 than any owner has ever 
started -- six. Last year, he had five and four the year before that. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a woman, two Japanese, a Brazilian and three rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a driver on the front row, Raul Boesel, splitting the royal Penskes, Al 
Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi with their 21st-Century dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 Indy's first lady, Lyn St. James, is a Simon driver, starting at the end of 
Row 2, outmaneuvering former winners Mario Andretti and Arie Luyendyk to get 
there, to say nothing of Her Majesty's special agent, Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon's other drivers are scattered through the field with rookies Hideshi 
Matsuda and Dennis Vitolo in Row 5, Hiro Matsushita in Row 6 and rookie Marco 
Greco starting where Dick Simon felt familiar -- last. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't pull a car off a lube rack and tee it up at Indy anymore. Dick Simon 
spends more hours in a suit and tie than a flameproof coverall these days, and 
when he isn't on a racetrack, he's in a boardroom selling the wonders of Indy 
as a marketing tool, pounding desks from Tokyo to J.C. Penney headquarters. "It 
is the most visible championship in all of sport," he insists. "A sponsor is 
buying more than a 230-mile-an-hour billboard, he's buying a piece of 
Americana. You don't have to explain the Indianapolis 500 in any corner of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Racing at Indy is as big business as the stock exchange today, and the Dick 
Simon who once only needed a helmet and bandanna now needs a briefcase and a 
slide show to scare up about $1 million per car. He has a 38,000-square-foot 
car shop, 62 employees and a direct line to most Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't pull gear boxes out of dumpsters anymore -- his cars are as 
thoroughbred as Man O' War. There isn't an inch of this track he doesn't know 
or on which he finally had to park a spent car. 
</P>
<P>
 He tests his drivers as thoroughly as his engines and stopped in Florida to 
rent a track and check out St. James before signing her. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes about 2 p.m. Sunday to be able to stand near the first woman ever to 
win Indy, or the first Japanese or the first rookie in 67 years and to thank 
the Roger Penskes and/or all the modern Dick Simons for filling the field and 
tell them how grateful he is because racing couldn't survive without them. He 
ought to know.

WORLD CUP '94 / 22 DAYS AND COUNTING; MAKING THE CUT; AMERICANS HOPE OPPONENTS 
WILL DREAD FACING COBI JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cobimania had reached the upscale halls of the Westin Bonaventure a couple of 
weeks ago. Cobi Jones can run very fast, but on this day he couldn't hide, at 
least not from his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 His fast-growing following found him and gathered around him everywhere he 
moved. Businessmen posed with him for pictures. He signed soccer balls, 
programs, trading cards and pieces of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 A savvy autograph veteran, Jones pointed out which pens worked on which 
surfaces. He engaged in chit-chat with his most fervent constituency -- 
giggling teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
 One had some valuable information, telling him, "There's a guy who is in my 
seventh-grade class that looks like you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones: "Good-looking guy, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cobi look-a-likes? 
</P>
<P>
 Should the U.S. soccer team have any success in the World Cup, there might be 
a whole generation of soccer playing, Cobi-wannabes, legions of charismatic 
midfielders wearing dreadlocks and mega-watt smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-visibility, low-maintenance dreadlocks are what turned Jones from a 
promising prospect into soccer's Andre Agassi, an eye-catching icon for the MTV 
crowd. He opted for the easier hairstyle before the 1992 Olympics and it 
quickly became a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Mada, caught a glimpse of Cobi's growing popularity during a game 
at Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills High when the crowd started chanting his name. A 
spectator turned to Mada Jones and asked a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Is he a soccer star or a rock star?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mada had an answer -- at least by the process of elimination, saying: "Well, 
he doesn't sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones leaves that to teammate Alexi Lalas, who has the second-most talked 
about hair on the squad. Maybe Lalas is the heir to Jones, so to speak. In 
September, Lalas helped open the team's Mission Viejo training center with a 
song and an announcement that he was selling some of Jones' hair afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The price has gone way up since then," Lalas said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hair helps make the image, the topic can get tiresome. Pat Riley 
backed up his hair with championships, Barry Melrose didn't. Agassi got there, 
eventually. Yannick Noah did too, but got so sick of the subject, he shed his 
dreadlocks and jokingly announced he lost his strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I get sick of it? Truthfully, yeah," Jones said. "But what do I expect? To 
have this kind of hair and not have questions?" 
</P>
<P>
 The dreadlock decision filled at least part of the Jones household with, well, 
dread. His father, Freeman, dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a bit conservative," Mada Jones said. "But you know how moms are. I 
teach junior high and I'm more in there with the trends. I think I was a bit 
more prepared for it. His father had to go along, it was two to one." 
</P>
<P>
 Kind of like a soccer score. Then Cobi's two brothers made it a 4-1 blowout. 
Now everyone is used to the dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fits the shape of his face," Mada Jones said. "I'm proud of the way he's 
handling the attention. He's very much at ease with it. It's like an inborn 
trait and it keeps him cool." 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, Jones has needed that attribute. His brother Bruce was once 
crushed against a railing when a crowd of about 20 teen-age girls mobbed Jones 
for his autograph after a game in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Jones turned down a fan's autograph request after a game against the 
German team Bayern Munich in Cleveland. A teen-age boy tried to swipe his 
jersey in the postgame crush, perhaps thinking a distracted Jones wouldn't 
notice. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just grabbed it back," Jones said. "Then he had the gall to ask me for an 
autograph. That was probably the first one I didn't give. There's nothing wrong 
with having a little common courtesy." 
</P>
<P>
 That incident was unusual. Almost all of his fan contact and mail is 
refreshingly normal. "Most of it is from young kids, around 10 or 11,' he said. 
"I don't get anything from 20-year-olds. There's nothing bad, nothing 
pornographic. I don't think we've gotten to that level yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones prides himself on filling all the autograph requests possible. There 
have been times when the team bus has rolled away, leaving him behind to forage 
for rides from fans or stadium workers. He is enjoying his celebrity, simply 
because his soccer accomplishments have almost always surpassed his 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 He made the team as a walk-on at UCLA in 1988, was cut twice by the U.S. 
Olympic team in 1992 but played in all three matches in Barcelona, and months 
later scored once and added two assists against the Ivory Coast in his third 
match with the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for praise, however, from U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic. "I don't 
talk about young players," Milutinovic said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones' speed along the flanks can create space. It also gives him the ability 
to provide a last-minute boost, the way he did against Bolivia, scoring the 
late goal in a 1-1 tie at the Joe Robbie Cup in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones will turn 24 on June 16, two days before the United States' first game 
of the World Cup in Pontiac, Mich., against Switzerland. Although Jones has 
spent most of his life in Southern California (Westlake Village), he was born 
in Detroit when his father was in a doctorate program at Wayne State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Jones is the only U.S. player to appear in all 17 matches, 
starting every one. He leads the team in minutes played. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid accumulation of international experience is helping Jones, although 
he can't exactly explain how or why. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really know because I always feel I'm playing the same," he said. "I 
guess that's for outsiders to say. After we lost (to Bayern Munich), someone 
said to me, 'You must be proud of how well you played.' But that's like someone 
giving advice about relationships and they can't handle their own problems with 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones does not believe in giving advice -- about soccer or anything else. He 
was asked and turned down the chance to be on KROQ's "Love Line" program with 
teammates Lalas and Tony Meola. His hipness does not extend into the Masters 
and Johnson field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to get into that," he said. "It's a dangerous area. I knew 
what kind of questions are asked and there were questions about (a listener's) 
sex life." 
</P>
<P>
 Potential embarrassment was not entirely averted. Jones agreed to do a turn on 
KROQ's "Reggae Revolution." Somehow, nestled between cuts of Bob Marley and 
Black Uhuru, the host posed a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me what I thought of the Switzerland coach not allowing his players 
to have sex during the World Cup," Jones said. "What did I think of that? And 
did Bora have those rules?" 
</P>
<P>
 So what did Jones say? 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer field isn't the only place where he is elusive. "I dodged it," he 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones would prefer some day to be asking questions, at least when his soccer 
career ends, which seems far off. After the World Cup, he will probably play in 
Europe. In the fall of 1992, he trained with FC Cologne of the German first 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones could see himself in law school if he wasn't playing soccer. 
Ideally, the emphasis would be on environmental law, combining a career with 
one of his primary concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry about things that can disappear when I'm doing my thing," said Jones, 
who was once an avid scuba diver. "Like the rain forest. Not the fact that the 
rain forest is so big and immense and that it will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "But by the time I get there it will be so varied from what it is now. Those 
are the things I wonder about. I want to be able to see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, soccer is helping Jones see the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for saving it?  
</P>
<P>
 First things first. 
</P>
<P>
 The World's Cup today, the rest of it tomorrow.

MIGHTY DUCKS; KARPOV, NOT KARIYA, NEAR A DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks say they are close to signing Valeri Karpov, their 
third-round pick in the 1993 entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to have the deal done by June," General Manager Jack Ferreira said."I 
don't think it's going to be a problem. He's coming over (from Russia) and 
we'll probably wait until he gets here to sign the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said the Ducks remain "far apart" in negotiations with Paul Kariya, 
their top pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov, a 22-year-old right wing, scored three goals and had one assist for 
Russia during the Olympics. The Russians finished fourth. He also played 32 
games for Traktor Chelyabinsk this last season, scoring 13 goals with 16 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, San Diego, the Ducks' minor league affiliate, named Walt Kyle 
their new coach. Kyle, 37, replaces Harold Snepsts, who was fired May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle coached Seattle of the Western Hockey League the last two seasons and was 
one of Ron Wilson's assistants on the U.S. team that was fourth at the World 
Championships this month. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

ENDLESS QUEST; LOCAL MEN RETRACE SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT WAVES OF CLASSIC 
MOVIE'S SURFING SAFARI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat O'Connell had dreamed of pulling his surfboard down that strand of white 
beach that went for miles without a footprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert (Wingnut) Weaver envisioned riding that perfect wave at Cape St. 
Francis, South Africa, the one that kept going and going and going . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They had watched Huntington Beach's Robert August and Mike Hynson ride that 
surf break before, in Bruce Brown's 1964 surfing documentary "The Endless 
Summer." They couldn't wait to get their shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years after Brown and August visited Cape St. Francis, pro surfers 
O'Connell and Weaver returned with the filmmaker for "The Endless Summer II." 
</P>
<P>
 And they discovered that the perfect wave -- and the world around it -- has 
imperfections. 
</P>
<P>
 They flew halfway around the world, drove over miles of highway and dirt roads 
and hiked across the hot sand only to find . . . Mission Viejo? 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of condominiums covered the shore, vegetation had grown over sand 
that in the past had blown out to the ocean to create a smooth, breaking wave 
that offered rides up to 45 seconds long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that," Weaver said, "and the first thing I said was 'Oh nooooo.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was a familiar sight for Weaver, who grew up in Newport Beach before moving 
to Santa Cruz in the late 1980s. It reminded O'Connell a little of Dana Point, 
where he has lived for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened at Cape St. Francis is a classic example of what happens when 
population spreads uncontrollably," Weaver said. "There were still waves there, 
but they weren't as good as the first movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver and O'Connell found great waves during two years of filming at prime 
surf breaks in South Africa, Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, Costa Rica, Hawaii 
and the Fiji Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trip offered them more than a chance to see how many floater maneuvers 
O'Connell, 22, could do while riding a shortboard, or how smooth Weaver, 28, 
could be riding a longboard. 
</P>
<P>
 They picked up a little perspective along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in Orange County isn't like growing up in the real world," 
O'Connell said. "You look at life so much differently once you have traveled 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I had traveled before on the pro surf tour, but your perspective is 
limited because you're concentrating on that quarter-mile of beach where you're 
competing. This was different. I learned that the world stretches far beyond 
the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 It stretched all the way to South Africa, where the waves were great but the 
politics lousy, last spring. The elections were still nearly a year away, and 
protesters lined some of the streets the surfers and film crew passed. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell and producer Roger Riddell were driving down a winding coastal road 
near Cape Town when radio reports warned that protesters were rolling boulders 
off freeway overpasses onto cars below. 
</P>
<P>
 Those overpasses were just a few exits away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us if we were coming through," O'Connell said, "that we should come 
through late, late at night, after everyone had gone home, or in broad 
daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through at dusk, the worst time. We looked ahead and saw people 
standing on the bridge, and I thought, 'No, this can't be.' 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got closer, we saw soldiers and a tank sitting on the bridge. They 
had everything under control." 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after returning to California, O'Connell read about Amy Biehl, a 
Newport Beach college student who was pulled from her car in Cape Town and was 
stabbed and beaten to death. He wondered, could that have been us? 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many militant uprisings when we were there," Weaver said, "that 
we didn't know if we would ever get to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's just extraordinary to see how everything worked out so well. The 
elections are over and transfer of power (to President Nelson Mandela) has gone 
through. Pat gets to go back in July with the world tour. What a great place to 
have an opportunity to go back to." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown discovered much has changed since he made the first picture. Filmed on a 
$50,000 budget, the first movie grossed an estimated $30 million worldwide. It 
was shot on a wind-up 16-millimeter camera by Brown, who worked alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The new version was shot with multiple state-of-the-art 35-millimeter cameras 
and includes underwater scenes. Brown, who directs the movie and co-wrote the 
script with son, Dana, had a budget of $3.3 million and an eight-member crew to 
capture the adventures of O'Connell and Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown considered dozens of surfers for the starring roles. Former 
world-champions Kelly Slater and Tom Curren, considered the Michael Jordan and 
Magic Johnson of surfing, were rumored to be the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown wanted to create a visual difference -- the ballet steps of the 
longboard ride along with the break dancing moves of a shortboard surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual friends put Brown in touch with Weaver and O'Connell in 1991. The 
surfers met for the first time during auditions at Brown's ranch north of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown saw potential in O'Connell, a blond-mopped kid who can match the energy 
level of 20 kindergartners on a sugar rush. And Brown saw potential in Weaver, 
the clean-cut, well-spoken surfer with an economics degree from UC Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want some guy with tattoos on his forehead and saying, 'Yeah, dude, 
groovy, trendy,' " Brown said. "When I met Pat, we talked for about 10 minutes 
and I thought, 'He's perfect.' He epitomized my perception of surfing. He's 
enthusiastic and doesn't look at the dark side of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither O'Connell nor Weaver are native Californians. O'Connell was born in 
Chicago and moved to Laguna Niguel with his parents when he was 12. Weaver was 
born in Germany and moved to Newport Beach when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver learned to bodysurf from a 65-year-old woman who was a regular at 
Corona del Mar beaches. He didn't start riding a board until 1982, his junior 
year at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 He always rode a longboard, refusing to try the shorter, faster version, even 
for Brown's cameras. He considers himself a surfing purist, a link from the 
legends who rode the longboard before him to the kids he hopes will ride it in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole style of longboarding appealed to me," Wingnut said. "It was a 
different approach to surfing, and I had always been into the 1950s and '60s. 
And surfing just captured that era so well." 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of the founding members of the Blackie's Longboard Contest in 
Newport Beach, and has won several contests, including the Malibu Club 
Invitational and the Coastline Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wingnut was the first of the young guys to really dedicate himself to riding 
the longboard," said August, who shaped 25 boards that Weaver used in the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before him, it was mainly older guys like me riding longboards. Now, younger 
kids are finding that you can have fun on them when the waves are three feet 
and mushy." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell started surfing in his early teens, sharpening his skills on breaks 
such as Upper and Lower Trestles and Salt Creek State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from Dana Hills High in 1989 and a year later won the first pro 
contest he entered, a U.S. tour event at Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991, O'Connell was in surfing's major leagues -- competing in a few 
world-tour events and qualifying contests. He upset former world champions 
Damien Hardman and Tom Carroll on his way to a fifth-place finish at Huntington 
Beach's Op Pro, but struggled on the European leg of the world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I surfed OK here or there in a contest," he said. "But I was not a complete 
surfer. I took these two years off to focus just on surfing, not the contests. 
Now, I feel a lot more confident coming into contests." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been more than a year since the film crew called it a wrap, and 
O'Connell and Weaver are eagerly awaiting the movie's June 3 premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 They're traveling the country with Brown to promote the movie. A photo spread 
in GQ magazine is scheduled for next month. Reporters from New York to Santa 
Cruz are calling for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell hasn't seen the finished product, only a preview showing before 
"Major League II" at a Dana Point theater. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid a matinee price for the movie, watched the preview and left. He hopes 
people leaving the theater will have the same feeling he did making it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much violence in all the movies around now, that I hope people 
will see this film and give a second thought to what the world can be like," he 
said. "There's still a way to get away, out of the concrete jungle. You just 
have to get off your butt and go find them." Endless Summer II Travelogue 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point's Pat O'Connell and former Newport Beach resident Robert (Wingnut) 
Weaver logged nearly 70 hours on airplanes in search of the perfect wave.

THERE ARE TALES FROM THE SURFSIDE EVEN OFF CAMERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R olling some extra credits from The Endless Summer and The Endless Summer II: 
 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers Pat O'Connell and Robert (Wingnut) Weaver confronted poisonous sea 
snakes, crocodiles and razor-sharp coral reefs lurking two feet underwater 
during filming of Bruce Brown's "The Endless Summer II." 
</P>
<P>
 They also ran into a pack of hungry lions in Africa -- and Weaver has a 
shredded wetsuit as proof. 
</P>
<P>
 He and O'Connell toured an African wildlife preserve when their dune buggy 
conveniently "stalled" among a pack of lions. Seems Brown wanted some footage 
of the lions and his two young stars, who were safe inside the cabin of the 
buggy. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, armed with a hand-held camera, taped the lions pulling travel bags 
full of equipment out of the back of the buggy. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did they find Weaver's wetsuit so tasty? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, what does your wetsuit smell like?" Weaver asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Week-old wet gym socks, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, mine smelled like a carcass baking in the sun all day," he said. "It 
was like catnip, it was dinner. My dog goes after my suit all the time. Why not 
lions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver, by the way, still surfed that day -- in his newly ventilated wetsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have that suit," he said. "It's a keeper. Maybe I'll have it framed." 
</P>
<P>
 Other tales from the shorebreak: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you thought Weaver had it rough, imagine how Huntington Beach's Robert 
August, who starred in the original 1964 "Endless Summer" with Mike Hynson, 
felt wearing only a pair ofshorts while surfing the chilly waters in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was freezing, 52 or 53 degrees," August said, "and we didn't have wetsuits 
then. I didn't want to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 -- August, who owns a surf shop in Huntington Beach, shaped 25 boards that 
Weaver used in the movie. August also accompanied the surfers on the first leg 
of their journey, to Costa Rica, where he's building a home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Wingnut" had a particularly tough time at Cloudbreak, off the island of 
Tavarua in the Fiji Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his longboard was too slow and lacked maneuverability to handle the 
10-foot conditions, he was pounded into the shallow coral reef a number of 
times. By the time he finished the session, he discovered his board leash had 
stretched a whopping nine feet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Weaver and O'Connell surfed Jeffreys Bay in South Africa with former world 
tour star Shaun Tomson and his friend, Walter, a Zulu tribesman. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few hours in overhead waves, Walter told O'Connell he didn't know how 
to swim. When Walter fell off his board, he just pulled the board back to him 
with his leash or simply stood up in Jeffrey Bay's shallow break. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While surfing in Indonesia, O'Connell and Weaver befriended a local who 
explains how he had his teeth filed down. He did it himself -- with a metal 
file.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The film is dedicated to the memory of Beverly Johnson, a member of the 
movie's crew, who died in the Easter Sunday helicopter accident in Nevada that 
also killed Disney president Frank Wells. MIKE REILLEY

RAMS; FORMER GIANT TACKLE AGREES TO TWO-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams, searching for a veteran tackle to protect quarterback Chris Miller, 
came to terms Wednesday on a two-year contract with free agent Clarence Jones 
of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is expected to sign with the Rams by the end of the week, said his 
agent, George Mavrikes.The Rams also came to terms on a two-year deal with 
tailback Cleveland Gary and a one-year contract with backup fullback-tailback 
David Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 6 feet 6 and 280 pounds, has backed up Jumbo Elliott and Doug 
Riesenberg in three seasons with the Giants. The Giants selected him in the 
fourth round of the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 During the free-agency period, he was courted by several teams, including 
Cleveland, Atlanta, Green Bay and Philadelphia, but chose the Rams because he 
thought he had a good chance to start. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams waived starting left tackle Irv Eatman in April, but used their top 
draft pick (16th overall) on Auburn's Wayne Gandy, whom they expect to be their 
future starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams need depth on the line, and Clarence has been healthy his entire pro 
career," Mavrikes said. "He can play left or right tackle, and I think he was a 
bargain for the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams need a veteran left tackle to protect the blind side of Miller, their 
oft-injured quarterback. In the first six weeks of the season, the Rams will 
face four of the top defensive ends and outside linebackers in the league -- 
Arizona's Clyde Simmons, Atlanta's Chris Doleman (twice), Kansas City's Derrick 
Thomas and Green Bay's Reggie White. MIKE REILLEY

DODGERS ROOT FOR COMEBACK, EVEN IF IT'S NOT WITH THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER and GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stunned by the news two months ago that Darryl Strawberry had entered a clinic 
to treat a substance abuse problem, Dodger players were not surprised by 
Wednesday's announcement that the club had bought out his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dodgers, who are in first place in the National League West without 
Strawberry, maintained that his absence hasn't been a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never hanging over our head this year at all," first baseman Eric 
Karros said. "We've just gone out and played and tried to put it behind us 
because the last two years we were counting on Darryl and things didn't work 
out. In 1992 and '93, the team was really built around (Strawberry), but this 
year he was a piece to the puzzle, he wasn't going to be the whole picture. The 
difference is this year one or two guys are not going to make or break this 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't really counting on him this year. If he was going to be in the 
lineup, that was great. But if he didn't come through or if things didn't work 
out, we were going to have to go on this season. There were going to be 162 
games this season with or without him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a matter of time when they were going to do it; you just didn't 
know when it was going to happen," Snyder said. "Even though he's a great 
player and he'll always be a great player, there were other things he had to 
take care of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we were really worried about it because he hasn't been here all 
season. We're worried about winning, and he's worried about getting his life 
back together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say whether it's good or bad for us mainly because you don't 
know whether he would have been (productive this season). I think the most 
important thing is for him to get his life in order." 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Brett Butler, Strawberry's closest friend on the team, said 
players have sensed that Strawberry wouldn't be a part of the team since spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just by the reaction from management (when Strawberry missed an exhibition 
game in Florida) it's been a process to get to the end result," Butler said. "I 
believe everyone severed it in spring training. This is just finalization." 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Mike Piazza was sorry to see Strawberry leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I wish he was here," Piazza said. "I don't think he'd be a 
distraction. He'd be a benefit to any team." 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Henry Rodriguez, who might have lost his starting job if 
Strawberry had returned, said he hadn't been concerned about being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't worried about him coming back this year," Rodriguez said. "I thought 
he might come back next year. We always talked about him, but when the game 
starts, you do what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief pitcher Roger McDowell, who spent 4 1/2 seasons with Strawberry on the 
New York Mets before coming to the Dodgers, hopes Strawberry can revitalize his 
flagging career. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy that Darryl entered rehabilitation and is getting on with his 
life," McDowell said. "Probably the best advice I have for him is the advice 
he's been given: Live one day at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Jim Gott was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the team not to be distracted," Gott said. "But he was a 
teammate of ours and a family member, so it's really tough. But like they say, 
this is a big business, so you have to deal with it, it's not the way it used 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud Darryl for taking care of this disease. We saw the steps he was 
making in spring training and we were so relieved. We said this is is not the 
troubled superstar, this is a full-on superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 Gott is confident that Strawberry, an eight-time All-Star, can come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw what he did the last part of '91 and never in all the years that I've 
played have I seen anyone dominate a team like him. I said, 'This guy can carry 
the club.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to come back in baseball and accept the responsibility of being a 
role model." 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Delino DeShields said: "I have no doubt that if he wants to 
play again, he'll play, because you can't keep a talent like that out of the 
game. I haven't spent as much time with him as other people, but I feel like I 
know him pretty well. I believe he was sad today." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was more concerned with Strawberry's future than with his return to 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's come by the house and I've talked to him on the phone," Butler said. 
"I'll miss him, he's my friend, but I'm more concerned about Darryl the person 
than I am about Darryl the player. And I just hope everything personally is in 
order, and if it is, he'll be playing somewhere next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him, he looked great. It looked like he'd gained a few pounds. 
We've kept in contact. He knows how much I love him. I've been on his side ever 
since he played here." 
</P>
<P>
 Cub Manager Tom Trebelhorn wasn't surprised by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not surprising because he had a couple tough years," Trebelhorn said. 
"Strawberry was (plagued by) lack of production, injuries and personal 
difficulties. He's not been the player that the Dodgers wanted him to be or 
that he wanted to be. Sometimes one of those things is enough for a player to 
move on. Sometimes one (of those factors) does you in." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was enough to end Strawberry's four-year Dodger career.

ANALYSIS; FANS ON HOLD AS DAVIS BOXES WITH COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although there is talk at the Coliseum that the Raiders will decide in the 
next two weeks where they will play next fall, experience would seem to 
indicate that there will be no decision until the last possible moment, 
probably sometime in August. 
</P>
<P>
 As has happened so often, the Coliseum Commission and the team's managing 
partner, Al Davis, are involved in a complicated negotiation and test of wills 
that, according to sources on both sides, is nowhere near over. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last round of such proceedings, 1989-90, Davis apparently used the 
prospect of moving the team to Sacramento or Oakland as a foil to entice Los 
Angeles into making a better deal. And he got one -- a series of promises, 
centering on a privately funded $145-million Coliseum renovation -- so 
favorable that no one could make good on it. 
</P>
<P>
 When it collapsed, the Raiders reportedly got their second $10-million 
non-performance payment in five years. The other had come from the city of 
Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
 The endless reports of Raider talks with Orlando, Baltimore, New Haven and, 
most recently, Oakland notwithstanding, those at the center of things generally 
believe Davis now wants to stay in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, they ask, would any good businessman want to be one of two NFL teams in 
the San Francisco Bay Area when, with the Rams possibly moving elsewhere, he 
has a fair shot at being the one team in Los Angeles, the nation's 
second-largest market? 
</P>
<P>
 So, as the Raiders have been quietly putting out, they will remain in Los 
Angeles but at a price -- the luxury boxes Davis has always wanted, plus 
something to sweeten the pot, be it free rent at the Coliseum or some other 
cash incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 All the skepticism coming from Davis about the earthquake repairs at the 
stadium being finished on time would appear to be just a smoke screen, since 
the work is on schedule, and barring another big earthquake, the project 
manager, Don Webb, says at least 50,000 seats, and probably more, will be ready 
when USC plays Washington on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' first scheduled home game is eight days later. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ferraro, vice president of the commission, is probably stating the 
obvious when he says Davis can get his boxes, if only he doesn't hold out for a 
lot of cash on the side -- cash the commission doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get a long-term commitment from the Raiders," Ferraro said this 
week. "Then we can establish the steady flow of income that will allow us to 
issue bonds and build the boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculate that this could all be done for as little as $20 million, 
although historic preservationists will insist that boxes not destroy the 
integrity of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And, it seems clear, there will be no boxes until the stadium's repairs are 
complete, including a new press box and a fortified peristyle. Both were 
wrecked by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 There is fear at the Coliseum that if the repair work and the boxes are 
intermingled, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is putting up 90% 
of the money, and the state, which is putting up the other 10%, might balk at 
paying all the repair bills. 
</P>
<P>
 So that probably means 1995 at the earliest for boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 One Coliseum commissioner said last weekend that he thought the commission 
almost had a deal with Davis. But Ferraro said the negotiations thus far have 
gone nowhere, and the Raiders said they hadn't "spent five minutes" with the 
optimist. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that hard negotiating lies ahead. Davis has never gone for a 
long-term deal with anyone, without some cash on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside for Davis on the one hand is that he hasn't yet thought it wise 
to send out his season-ticket forms -- his attendance was already down last 
year -- while on the other, he appears to some in the community to be taking 
advantage of the earthquake to put pressure on the commissioners to come up 
with a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 A season ticket-holder calling in Tuesday morning expressed outrage that the 
Raiders haven't shown more loyalty to their chosen home. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to look at it, however, is that Davis, having repeatedly missed 
out on getting the boxes in his team's 14-year struggle to establish itself 
solidly in Los Angeles, is determined to do anything to achieve that goal now. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Oakland and the other cities, they will probably have to wait to see 
whether he succeeds.

SOFTBALL / COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; FOR OPENERS, MATADORS CAN SHOW MISSOURI; FIRST 
ROUND: NORTHRIDGE, AMONG THE FAVORITES, SWEPT TIGERS IN DOUBLEHEADER EARLIER 
THIS SEASON, 8-1 AND 12-0. 
</P>

<P>
 For the first time in 12 NCAA College World Series appearances, the UCLA 
softball team is not the the most feared Southern California entry. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction belongs to third-ranked Cal State Northridge, a team in only 
its fourth season of Division I competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, eight teams open the double-elimination tournament, which will conclude 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (49-8), which swept UCLA, 2-1 and 6-1, in a doubleheader this 
season, is seeded second and will play Missouri (40-21) in a first-round game 
at 6:30 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, making its second consecutive World Series appearance, defeated 
Missouri in both games of a March doubleheader, 8-1 and 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "They slap, they run, they hit, they pitch, they catch," Northridge Coach Gary 
Torgeson said of the Matadors' unranked opponent. "What else can I say? If we 
don't win this one, we shouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors are led by senior first-team All-American Amy Windmiller (24-2), 
whose 0.28 earned-run average is the lowest in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game of the doubleheader against Missouri, Windmiller tossed one 
of her five no-hitters this season. She walked one and struck out 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked UCLA (41-12), which had not lost as many as 12 games in a season 
since a 28-15 finish in 1986, is vying for its eighth NCAA title in 19 seasons 
under Coach Sharron Backus. The Bruins will play Fresno State (48-14) at 12:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA senior DeeDee Weiman (18-6) leads the nation with 12 strikeouts per seven 
innings. Weiman has 318 strikeouts in 185 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Arizona (60-3), the defending champion, will face Illinois Chicago 
(56-17-1) in the tournament opener at 10 a.m., and Oklahoma State (43-10) will 
play Utah (50-11) at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 If Northridge wins its opener, it faces the Oklahoma State-Utah winner on 
Friday. The UCLA-Fresno State winner advances to a game against the 
Arizona-Illinois Chicago winner. First-round losers do not play again until 
Saturday.

SOFTBALL / COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; WOMEN OF CSUN STAND BY THEIR MAN; TORGESON'S 
HARDBALL STYLE HAS BUILT MATADORS INTO A SOFTBALL POWERHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When softball Coach Gary Torgeson was shaken by the initial bone-jarring jolts 
of January's earthquake, his first thoughts were not of his personal safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jiminy Christmas," he recalls thinking. "What's this going to do to our 
season?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are people who say Torgeson is obsessed with winning. 
</P>
<P>
 He wholeheartedly agrees. He was a loser once and couldn't handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before he took over the Cal State Northridge softball team and became the 
winningest coach in school history, Torgeson guided the Matador football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 His teams had a record of 8-24-1 in three seasons. Then he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tumultuous years that followed, Torgeson alternated between attempting 
to eat and drink himself to death. Neither habit quelled his bitter 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation arrived 13 years ago -- a second opportunity as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport was softball, and under Torgeson, football and softball became 
intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style hasn't changed, that's for sure," says Torgeson, who takes a career 
record of 633-214-8 into tonight's game against Missouri, Northridge's 
first-round opponent in the College Softball World Series in Oklahoma City. "In 
football, I wanted my offensive linemen to be gnarly, guys who liked to rip 
people around, guys who had to be bailed out of jail occasionally. I look for 
the same type of fire in a softball player." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson recognizes the flames of competitiveness because they burn within 
him, occasionally singeing those closest to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently has he reconciled with Debbie, his wife of 30 years, after a 
separation of more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson, 51, cites numerous reasons for their breakup, but his inability to 
handle failure as a football coach was foremost among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a jerk for a while," he says. "I was bitter for a lot of years, really 
bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he stayed at Northridge, remaining a part of the football coaching 
staff for six years after he was replaced as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "My loyalty always has been to the university," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Torgeson's roots are in Northridge. The school was built on land he 
romped through as a child. It was covered with orange and walnut groves then. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson graduated from what was then San Fernando Valley State in 1965. He 
was the Matadors' first four-year football letterman and, by age 31, was the 
school's fourth head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Being true to his school hasn't always been easy. When Jack Elway left to 
become San Jose State's head coach in 1979, Torgeson inquired about reclaiming 
the top job. Don't bother applying, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years after that, school officials approached him about softball, a 
fledgling program that just completed its third season. Go figure. Torgeson's 
only background in the sport came as a youth league coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted the offer and in 1982 immersed himself in the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda High football Coach Joel Schaeffer, who played on the offensive line 
next to Torgeson at Cleveland High and Northridge, says coaching softball 
provided his friend "with something to drown himself in." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson already tried to do the same with beer and junk food. All he did was 
gain weight, ballooning from 180 pounds to more than 240. Building a softball 
program was a more constructive release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody realized how tough it was for him," Debbie Torgeson 
says. "Gary had a vision. With all his might and strength, he believed he was 
the answer to putting Cal State Northridge football over the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Right school, wrong sport. Torgeson accepts that now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up against a lot more than we could handle," Torgeson says of his 
football days. "As I look back, I wasn't ready. I was a bull in a china shop. 
Arrrgh! Willing to attack anything. At that point I still believed that if you 
worked hard, you could make anything happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting amid the clutter of his second-floor office in the Northridge 
gymnasium, Torgeson is wearing black sweat pants, a red Cal State Northridge 
polo shirt and a black and red "Matadors" cap. Torgeson's wardrobe is almost 
entirely red, white and black, in keeping with the school's colors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Torgeson's use of black uniforms prompted the school to add black as 
an official color. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of photos, collages and inspirational messages cover the walls and 
bookshelves of his office. Conspicuous among them is a handwritten directive in 
bold black and red letters which reads, "There's no crying in softball!!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not at Northridge. Cursing and yelling perhaps, but not crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson coaches college softball's version of the Gashouse Gang. His players 
are outspoken, demonstrative, sometimes even crude. Extremely talented, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the team's top players, including All-American outfielder Beth 
Calcante and outfielder Jen Fleming, are still around despite quitting or being 
kicked off the team more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson recalls have telephone conversations with Calcante that left his ears 
ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can get as hot as I am," he says somewhat admiringly. "It can get ugly. 
We get on the phone and I swear we don't need the receiver. She's loud and I'm 
loud and nobody can hear anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, somehow, they all have ended up on the same wavelength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I didn't go anywhere else," Calcante says. "Other teams have 
problems, but they're not allowed to talk about them and they end up taking it 
out on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we need to be yelled at. Sometimes we need to yell back." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson admits that such exchanges would not have been tolerated during the 
years he was playing and coaching football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be my way or the highway," he says. "There was no water. We were 
passing out on the field. You did exactly what the coach said or you were out 
of there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the way it is today. Kids respect discipline, but they also expect 
to be respected as a person." 
</P>
<P>
 But Torgeson is not afraid to goad his players to improve performance. During 
a tournament game last season, Torgeson, from the third base coaching box, 
flashed a sign to a slumping Fleming. It was a choke sign -- both hands wrapped 
around his throat. "I was all over her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, though seething, came through with a hit and Northridge won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't treat them like men," Torgeson says. "I don't treat them like women. 
I treat them like athletes. People talk about gender equity, but some of these 
guys never have been allowed to be who they really are." 
</P>
<P>
 Guys? "Yeah," Torgeson says. "To me that's a non-gender term." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, before playing arch-rival Fresno State in an NCAA regional, the 
Matadors were treated to special batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures of Fresno State players were cut out and glued to a pinata. 
Northridge players were given turns with a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Need it be mentioned that Torgeson looks to recruit a special breed? As much 
for talent, prospects are graded on attitude. The badder the better, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look for scrappers," Torgeson says. "How do they play when they're behind? 
Do they fold up their tent, or do they get tougher? How are they off the field? 
Do they spit? Do they hate to lose?" 
</P>
<P>
 The prototype: Barbara Jordan, a three-time Division II All-American who 
played for the Matadors from 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a pistol," Torgeson says. "She loved to play and she hated to lose. 
She had something to prove -- to everybody. She was spunky. She had a little 
reputation as being a dirty player, but you always wanted Barbara on your team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She taught me a lot. Don't put the fire out. Keep it burning, just keep it in 
its place." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson as a football player was much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of those guys who always played better than his ability level," 
Schaeffer says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a coach, Torgeson has benefited from the same work ethic that allowed him 
to surpass expectations as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a completely thorough approach," says Janet Sherman, Northridge's top 
assistant and a former UCLA catcher. "He looks at every angle." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson's attention to detail helped Northridge rebound from a 2-0 loss 
against Fullerton last Sunday to defeat the Titans, 4-0, in the regional final 
at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Between games, Torgeson instructed Northridge hitters to review tape of 
themselves at the plate, paying special attention to the way they were being 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, they backed off the plate and started stinging the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever works. But success has not come without a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his 50th birthday, Torgeson has begun to reflect on his life and career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've probably spent too much of my life here at school," he says. "My only 
regret is that I wasn't able to put both levels together, the competitiveness 
and my personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Torgeson heard her husband admit as much last week as he was advising a 
friend during a postgame celebration at a Northridge pizza parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he even knows I heard it," she says. "But even though it wasn't 
said to me, it was very healing. Unfortunately, there is something about 
coaching that is all-consuming. Sometimes it eats you up and spits you out." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes a person can pick himself up and find his way to the top. Which 
is where Torgeson sat last Sunday, on the shoulders of a boisterous group of 
Matador fans after Northridge's regional victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That probably was the most exciting time of my life here at Northridge," 
Torgeson says. "This has been so gratifying to me, to put a team on the field 
and win. We've made an impact. Finally I feel like maybe I have left a notch 
here for the university."

BIRMINGHAM ATHLETES MIGHT HAVE FIELD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Birmingham High track Coach Scott King said his athletes will have little 
advantage competing on their home track in today's City Section championships, 
but when it comes to the field, that's a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham must excel in the field events if the Braves expect to win their 
second boys' title in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey is favored to post its second consecutive victory in the meet, which 
starts with field events at 3 p.m. and running events at 4:30. However, King 
said his athletes' familiarity with the jump runways and the high jump apron at 
Tom Bradley Stadium could prove decisive in the battle for first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having the home-field advantage is definitely going to help us," King said. 
"I think that working out on and practicing on our field all season is going to 
make our kids comfortable with the conditions, whereas kids from other schools 
might not feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, powered by sprinter Leo Settle, hurdler Anthony Mabry and two 
excellent relay teams, is expected to garner most of its points in track 
events, while Birmingham will be led by versatile James Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln is favored in the high jump (personal best of 6 feet 10 inches), and 
could also win the long jump (22-2 3/4) and triple jump (46-0 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
 King doesn't expect him to win the 110-meter high hurdles -- the meet's first 
running event -- but if he and junior teammate Marvin Powell can place among 
the top five, they could give Birmingham a huge lift. Points are awarded to the 
top six finishers on a 10-8-6-4-2-1 basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax, Palisades and El Camino Real also could win if things break their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real qualified only four athletes, but the Conquistadores could post 
1-2 finishes in the pole vault and shotput.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kokorowski (15-6) and Craig Wobig (14-6) have the best marks in the 
vault, as do Brian Tade (57-7 1/2) and Jeff Macrea (51-7) in the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre DeSaussure of Taft is favored to win his second consecutive title in the 
400, and Danny Haag of Granada Hills is a contender in the 110 highs, 300 
intermediates and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena, Westchester and Dorsey appear to be the top three girls' teams, 
followed by Cleveland, Hamilton and Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 Neisha Henderson of Cleveland has personal bests of 17-1 in the long jump and 
36-7 1/2 in the triple jump, and is favored in those events. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood's Darvena Merritt is heavily favored in the shotput after 
setting a personal best of 42-2 in last week's preliminaries. Tinika McThomas 
of El Camino Real is expected to contend in the 100 and 200, while Kristin Kabo 
of Kennedy is a threat in the 3,200.

 For the first time in 12 NCAA College World Series appearances, the UCLA 
softball team is not the the most feared Southern California entry. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction belongs to third-ranked Cal State Northridge, a team in only 
its fourth season of Division I competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight teams begin play today in the double-elimination tournament, which will 
conclude Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (49-8), which swept UCLA, 2-1 and 6-1, in a double-header this 
season, is seeded second and will play Missouri (40-21) at 6:30 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, making its second consecutive World Series appearance, defeated 
Missouri in both games of a March doubleheader, 8-1 and 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors are led by senior first-team All-American pitcher Amy Windmiller 
(24-2), whose 0.28 earned-run average is the lowest in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked UCLA (41-12), which had not lost as many as 12 games in a season 
since a 28-15 finish in 1986, is vying for its eighth NCAA title in 19 seasons 
under Coach Sharron Backus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins will play Fresno State (48-14) at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA senior DeeDee Weiman (18-6) leads the nation with 12 strikeouts per seven 
innings. Weiman, who red-shirted last season, has 318 strikeouts in 185 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Arizona (60-3), the defending champion, will face Illinois Chicago 
(56-17-1) in the tournament opener at 10 a.m., and Oklahoma State (43-10) will 
play Utah (50-11) at 4 p.m.

ANOTHER BOONE FOR THE TROJANS; AARON, A JUNIOR THIRD BASEMAN, IS HOPING TO END 
USC CAREER WITH A TRIP TO OMAHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It has been 16 years since USC visited Omaha for the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 These have been years of near-misses and what-might-have-beens for the program 
that has won a record 11 national baseball titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Boone is very much aware of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of been like a ghost," said Boone, the Trojans' junior third 
baseman. "We've been close so many times, including last year. I think this 
team is capable of finally getting there." 
</P>
<P>
 USC (38-18) begins its quest for a World Series berth today when it plays 
North Carolina Greensboro (37-16) in the NCAA South Regional at Baton Rouge, 
La. The Trojans are seeded second behind defending national champion Louisiana 
State in a regional that also includes Southeastern Louisiana, Tulane and 
Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State (39-17), seeking its fourth World Series appearance in six 
seasons under Coach Dave Snow, is seeded second in the Midwest II Regional at 
Wichita, Kan. The 49ers open play Friday against Washington (42-16) in a 
regional that also includes top-seeded Georgia Tech, Wichita State, West Coast 
Conference champion Santa Clara and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton (41-13) is seeded second in the Midwest I Regional at 
Stillwater, Okla., and will open Friday against Northwestern State (44-13). The 
regional also includes top-seeded Oklahoma State, Texas Christian, Memphis and 
Illinois State. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the eight six-team double-elimination regionals will advance to the 
World Series June 3-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, 6 feet 2, 185 pounds, is batting .338 with five home runs and 24 runs 
batted in. He has stolen 25 bases, a USC single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone would like nothing more than to complete his Trojan career with a trip 
to Omaha before signing a professional contract after the June 2 draft.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to get going and start playing for real," Boone said. "It's time to 
try and get there and make a life out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 If history and bloodlines are any indication, Boone is in for a successful 
major league career. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandfather, Ray Boone, was a major league infielder for 12 years and has 
been a longtime scout. His father, Bob Boone, played 19 years in the major 
leagues and is a coach with the Cincinnati Reds. His brother, Bret Boone, 
played at USC and became the first third-generation major league player when he 
broke in with the Seattle Mariners in 1992. He is the Reds' starting second 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have a long way to go," Aaron Boone said. "I'm by no means a great 
player or a finished player." 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts agree. They consider Boone a work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at him and grade him out for speed, throwing arm, hitting and 
hitting for power, he doesn't rate at the top of the scale in any of the 
individual categories," one scout said. "Collectively, though, he does 
everything way above average -- and his makeup and instincts are excellent. 
There's no doubt he will play in the major leagues and play there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach Mike Gillespie said: "It's happened for him like you would want it 
to happen for everyone -- he's made progress. Improve and get better and better 
and better. He's been a perfect example of that." 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman in 1992, Boone started at third base and batted .272 with no 
homers and 25 RBIs in 53 games. The Trojans finished 28-26 and missed the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal when I came in was to play right away and make an impact," Boone 
said. "I think I established myself as an OK player." 
</P>
<P>
 However, last season started badly for Boone. He committed 18 errors in the 
first 21 games and struggled at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nightmare, unbelievable," Boone said. "I went into the season with 
high expectations and couldn't imagine anything like that happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Boone came out of his fielding slump and made only seven errors in the final 
43 games. He batted .286 with five homers and 39 RBIs. USC finished 35-29, 
losing to Texas, 3-2, in the championship game of the Central Regional at 
Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me a better player in the long run to have gone through something 
like that," said Boone, who has made only eight errors this season. "This year, 
if I'm not hitting, I know I can go out there and help the team with my glove." 
</P>
<P>
 USC played at Baton Rouge in the 1990 playoffs, winning its first three games 
before losing twice to LSU. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone intends to help the Trojans take the final step to Omaha. They won five 
of their last six regular-season games, including two of three against 
Fullerton and a sweep of Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about getting some momentum going and getting hot going into the 
regionals," Boone said. "Judging by how we're playing and our mental state, I 
think we're confident and ready to get rolling."

WILLARD RESIGNS AT CAMARILLO, WILL SEEK FOOTBALL COACHING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Willard has resigned as Camarillo High baseball coach to spend more time 
with his family and pursue football coaching opportunities, he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard, the defensive coordinator for the Camarillo football team the past 
eight years, said wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife and two 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to get down to one sport as much I could the last couple 
years, and this looked like a good opportunity," Willard said. "I've got a 
4-year-old and an 8-month-old and I've been coaching two or three sports for 
four years, and I guess I just got tired of coaching 12 months a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Willard, 36, took over the Camarillo baseball program five seasons ago. He 
also has coached girls' basketball and softball at various times, but his first 
love, he said, has always been football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'd be a great head coach," Camarillo football Coach Carl Thompson 
said. "He's ready right now." 
</P>
<P>
 He interviewed for the football head coach openings at Canyon and Rio Mesa, 
but he said he is not pursuing any other opportunities now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a really good job at Camarillo," Willard said. "I'm content with my 
classroom teaching assignment. I live near the school. I've enjoyed working at 
the school. I've enjoyed working with the football program. Cutting down to one 
sport gives me more time to spend at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson understands Willard's desire to stick to football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard to do two sports like that," he said. "It's been driving him 
up the wall the last couple years." 
</P>
<P>
 Willard led the baseball team to a 12-12 record this season. The Scorpions 
were 7-7 in the Marmonte League, finishing in fifth place and missing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Principal Terry Tackett said the school will begin a search for a 
new baseball coach as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate his efforts over the past five years," Tackett said. "He was a 
hard worker and he was dedicated to the program."

WINDOW DRESSING; MANNEQUINS HAVE EVOLVED. NO LONGER PRIMITIVE STIFFS, THESE 
SCULPTURED AND ABSTRACT CREATURES CAN HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS THE NEXT GUY -- 
WITHOUT MESSING UP THEIR CLOTHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For mannequins, life used to be one long bad hair day. Stuck in gawky poses 
day in and day out, their wigs perched unevenly on their bald heads, mannequins 
led sorry existences selling clothes. Look at them now. They're having more fun 
than most humans. They're holding barbecues in department store windows. 
They're mixing it up at cocktail parties. They're playing on swings. They're 
flying. Mannequins have evolved from primitive-looking, stiff humanoid forms 
that resembled giant Barbie and Ken dolls to avant-garde, sculptural creatures 
that can sit, jump, dive, slouch, pose, and literally bend over backward. Some 
modern mannequins have no hair, some have no facial features and some are 
missing important body parts. Others are strikingly lifelike, down to the fine 
pores on their fiberglass skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the frozen dummies of the past, many of today's mannequins are easy to 
manipulate. Those whose limbs aren't made of hard fiberglass can perform 
various feats such as straddling a bike or playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Emporio Armani uses mannequins that have no arms, legs or heads. They've been 
cropped to just their torsos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using abstract, abbreviated versions of mannequins," says Cindy Sirko, 
visual director for all divisions of Armani including the Emporio Armani store 
in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. Emporio Armani's mannequins resemble ordinary 
shirt forms used in department stores, but instead of plain barrel-chested 
torsos, these are shaped like real bodies complete with chests and muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we stuff the arms and legs (of the clothes) with tissue paper to animate 
the figure . . .. We make them seated, standing, in every possible attitude," 
Sirko says. "An arm can go into a jacket or pocket. You see how fluid the 
clothes are." 
</P>
<P>
 Windows in the South Coast Plaza store recently showed mannequins wearing 
jeans with 6-foot inseams so they looked like they were standing on stilts. 
Regular-size mannequins clung to their legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of group activities," Sirko says. "We've had them sitting on 
swings, and (engaged) in little crowd scenes. In our New York store we actually 
had them flying in the air -- they were stuck in cobwebs for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only limited by our ideas, whereas with the more traditional fiberglass 
mannequin the only way to change the display is to change the angle you view 
it," Sirko says. 
</P>
<P>
 While mannequins may cause a chuckle or raise an eyebrow, their role is a 
serious one. Without them, customers could not appreciate the drape of the 
clothing on a human figure or how the proportions are supposed to fit, Sirko 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see if a collar is supposed to be up or down, buttoned to the neck or 
left open," Sirko says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mannequins have occasionally been caught in compromising positions. In 
honor of Father's Day, the Los Angeles Armani store featured male mannequins 
with their pants and boxer shorts down where their ankles should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no legs so you used your imagination," Sirko says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannequins have also turned a few heads at Barneys New York. In one memorable 
scene at the New York City store, mannequins were shown trying to give up 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "One was giving up, one was lighting up, one was trying hypnosis and one was 
writing down 'quit smoking' for her New Year's resolution," says Steven 
Johanknecht, vice president of display for Barneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Johanknecht designs mannequins exclusively for Barneys because "they play such 
a strong role in the interiors." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very carefully thought-out. Sometimes stores drop it when it comes to 
mannequins," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Barneys' mannequins tend to look more like sculptures in a museum than people. 
Their faces, if they have them, are abstract works of art, some with vague 
noses, mouths and faint depressions where the eyes should be. Most have no 
paint on their faces at all, except for a group of females who wear only ruby 
lipstick and streaks of brown for their eyebrows and eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '80s everyone used realistic mannequins. Now it seems more fresh to 
use abstract forms," Johanknecht says. "It focuses more attention on the 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mannequins that look uncannily human still inhabit many stores. Adel 
Rootstein, Inc., a large mannequin manufacturer based in New York City and 
London, copies their mannequins from live models. Occasionally they copy 
celebrities, but only those who "have fashion significance," says Michael 
Southgate, creative director for Adel Rootstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who have been cloned into mannequins: Cher, Twiggy and Joan 
Collins -- before her "Dynasty" days. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was already one of the most glamorous mature women in the world. She 
epitomized power dressing," Southgate says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Adel Rootstein mannequins are copies of real-life fashion models, who sit 
for hours at a time to have their "portraits" sculpted out of clay and 
reproduced in fiberglass. While faces can be duplicated in a few hours, a 
full-body mannequin requires the subject to be present four hours a day for 
about three weeks, Southgate says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sculpt from life," he says. Because they're made by hand, mannequins don't 
come cheap. They cost about $900 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Adel Rootstein produces about 20,000 mannequins a year, supplying many of the 
nation's major retailers including Neiman Marcus, Bullock's, Saks Fifth Avenue, 
I. Magnin and Charlotte Russe. 
</P>
<P>
 Notions about beauty change with the times, so mannequins must change as well. 
Twiggy posed for her mannequin in 1967, a time when voluptuous types like 
Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield were being replaced by skinny women with 
boyish physiques as the feminine ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole perception of beauty and body shape changed," Southgate says. 
"Before Twiggy, we couldn't imagine doing a knock-kneed, flat-chested, 
pigeon-toed girl." 
</P>
<P>
 These days youthful, natural-looking models who have glowing skin and don't 
look made up are the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to look slightly messy or disheveled. Sophisticated is out," 
Southgate says. "Now it's an uncontrived, natural look." 
</P>
<P>
 The new crop of dewy-faced models makes life challenging for Adel Rootstein: 
</P>
<P>
 "The more natural (the models) get, the harder they are to duplicate in 
fiberglass," Southgate says.

HANDING OUT HOPE; FERNANDO LEON'S SURVIVED THE STREETS, BUT HE COULDN'T FORGET 
THEM. NOW, HE COUNSELS GANG MEMBERS AND DREAMS OF FINDING THEM A WAY OUT TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Leon can tell stories that make the homeboys cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 He starts in a voice so soft you are forced to inch closer. Then his dark 
brown eyes lock in like a surface-to-air missile. As he whips his arms to 
stress a point, you get a glimpse of a gang tattoo -- a WC intertwined, for 
Watts Caballeros -- etched on his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories spill out. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the one about the time he was 16 and his best friend, Mike, who worked 
with him on the assembly line in a fiberglass company, decided to experiment 
with heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened during a lunch break. Leon went to the corner liquor store for his 
daily quart of beer and a burrito. Mike went to the restroom to shoot up, after 
trying to persuade Leon to join him. After lunch, Leon found his buddy, no 
longer breathing, in the bathroom, crouched over the toilet with the needle 
still in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was what I had to look forward to and decided to get out of 
the gang lifestyle," Leon tells teen-agers in a slow-paced, hushed monotone in 
the neighborhoods he visits. "I thought it was just a matter of time before I 
ended up like my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 This 51-year-old former gang member and high school dropout wants today's 
gangs to hear his words and their underlying message: There is hope and a way 
out. He knows firsthand what a waste gangbanging is and doesn't want others to 
experience the hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon, who lives in Garden Grove, has been active in gang- and crime-prevention 
projects all over Orange County. Four years ago, he shut down his printing 
business, and with his wife's financial support, he now works full time as a 
kind of free-lance social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends most of his days in the barrios, counseling gang members. He also 
follows up on their job applications and helps them through the legal system if 
they are arrested. He meets with community groups and police departments, 
trying to improve communications and offer insight about life on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped found Standing Together Now, a Stanton group of neighborhood leaders 
who try to keep kids out of gangs and involved in other activities, such as 
sports. STN helped gang members get the city to fund the construction of a 
handball court in a small city park. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he produced La Calle (the Street), a 54-page magazine mostly 
written and illustrated by gang members. It provided a forum for young people 
to voice their rage while promoting ethnic pride and highlighting grief from 
gang involvement. A second issue will be published next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Leon's force of personality that is his most potent weapon. Men and 
women alike seem captivated by his charm. 
</P>
<P>
 His money problems, broken marriages and experiences as a gang member, ex-con, 
weed smoker, pill popper and alcoholic may not make Leon an expert in gang 
mentality, but, he says, "I can relate and warn the youngsters about the 
responsibilities they will face for everything they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Many community leaders and activists believe that Leon has eked out some 
success where community anti-gang programs and politicians' promises have 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando has basically been on the front lines for a number of years, facing 
very serious conditions in our society," says Steve Delgadillo, Anaheim's gang 
and drug program assistant coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's completely lived and walked in (gang members') shoes, and he's accepted 
because he's proved he is a genuine friend," Orange City Councilman Fred L. 
Barrera says. "He can go into dangerous neighborhoods that a lot of people, 
including myself, would not even think about stepping into." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leon grew up in Watts with his parents and three sisters, all of whom tried to 
push him away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers the beatings he got at the hands of young thugs when he was a 
scared little boy, and how he was forced to take it and fight back "like a 
man." Faint scars still mark his forehead where he was hit with metal pipes 
back in the early 1950s. He wears an inch-long scar on his left wrist from a 
knife headed for his face that was thrown by a childhood enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 15, an 18-year-old friend, whom Leon admired, was shot and killed 
in a late-night gang fight after being cornered and outnumbered while walking 
home from a party. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon was shot at several times and, at 16, almost killed when a rival gang 
member pinned a can opener to his neck and blood started dribbling down. The 
youth stopped only after realizing he had the wrong guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the Marines when he was 17 took Leon away from that lifestyle for two 
years. But when he returned, the streets called him back. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Leon was convicted on assault charges stemming from a fight with 
police. He had been driving home from a party, where, he says, he had guzzled 
so much alcohol he could hear it swishing in his belly. 
</P>
<P>
 The police pulled him over for making an illegal right turn. An officer told 
Leon to stand on the curb while the first officer filled out a citation. Leon 
mouthed off to the second officer and swung at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is now part of his arsenal illustrating how stupid shows of 
toughness are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leon, whose rib-length, graying black hair wraps his shoulders as he speaks, 
acknowledges that his personal life has also been chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Geraldine, have been married 15 years. But he is twice 
divorced and has seven children. Many times, he says, he doesn't make the 
monthly $173 child support payment for his youngest daughter, 16-year-old 
Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends helped him foot his overdue payments last year, after he served a 
month in jail for failing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine, 32, has stood by Leon because she believes his is a worthy cause. 
She works as a travel agent and supports herself and her husband, who has no 
paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without her, I would be on the streets and probably not able to do what I'm 
doing now," Leon says. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his decision to quit his paying job and devote himself full time was 
"a calling from God." But it also involved a long family meeting with his 
children and Geraldine. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon's children have watched their father and have begun to believe in his 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter Vivian Gomez, 22, says at first her siblings and step-siblings 
were disappointed with their father's devotion. They tried to change his 
priorities so he would focus on them, but they finally gave up and now lend him 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hated what he was doing, but he's always been able to make everything OK. 
He's so patient and sincere that you just can't hate Dad," Gomez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon "is just doing what everyone thinks about doing," daughter Nicole says. 
"He doesn't make you do what you don't want to do. He just brings out goodness 
in you, and when you get a taste of that, it's a part of you." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicole wasn't always so fond of her father's work. For years, she says, 
she couldn't understand why Leon had to spend so much time with gang members 
instead of with her. But last year, when she was 15, Nicole inadvertently read 
a letter addressed to her father and realized that what he was doing was not a 
waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, handwritten by a mother whose son had been killed in a gang fight, 
thanked Leon for his efforts at keeping kids from joining gangs and urged him 
to continue his crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "That mother talked about how precious her son was and was asking my dad to 
try to unite all gangs to stop all this crazy violence," says Nicole, who lives 
with her mother in Downey. "I finally realized that people are listening to my 
dad and that he's an incredible man. People want to unite but don't know how, 
and that's where my dad fits in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Leon's La Calle made its debut last year, he personally delivered the 
3,100 copies to high school campuses and in neighborhoods where gang members 
congregate. He targeted teen-age Latinos, hoping they would read the journal 
and get its message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stressing unity," he says. "We're all brothers and sisters, so why are we 
hurting each other? The bottom line is, it makes no difference where you are 
right now. Even if you're hard-core, you can still do something positive, and 
here we are to help you and show you how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 His advertising-free journal, written in English and some Spanish, is 
sprinkled with success stories of teen-agers and community leaders who were 
raised in gang-infested barrios but overcame temptations. Also included are job 
listings, recreational activities and gang-prevention programs. But the stories 
that exemplify the grief from senseless gang tragedies make the strongest 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 People who work with gangs say an impact was felt in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of gang members like La Calle because it's (promoting) unity," says 
Herbert Alamo, a Fullerton College student who grew up around gangs in La 
Habra. "They're seeing their work published, and it gives them feelings of 
self-worth and pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Medina, 19, of Santa Ana, once known among police as a notorious 
graffiti tagger, credits Leon with getting him to kick his scribbling habit 
last year. Then, Leon helped Medina get a job as a youth counselor for the City 
of Santa Ana and persuaded him to channel his artistic abilities into drawings 
and cartoons for La Calle. Some of those artworks will appear in the second 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leon's work with gangs doesn't stop with La Calle and his community 
activism. He dreams of a building where he can store printing presses and 
convert it into a nonprofit school, where gang members could be taught the 
printing trade. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has asked community organizations and individuals to help him get a 
large mobile unit, which he plans to haul to neighborhood streets and parks to 
spin oldies records and provide outreach services every weekend. Leon says 
organizations and agencies would be invited to provide literature and 
counseling services on issues ranging from parenting and social 
responsibilities to health education. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem is, the estimated cost of the dream is nearly $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando says everything can be done," Medina says. "Sometimes what he says 
sounds so impossible. But, he's a very patient man who can do it. I'm with him, 
and I know this is going to kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon believes that he is lucky to be alive and just wants gang violence to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are listening because I'm telling the truth and I'll keep my 
word," Leon says. "If it kills me, I'll keep my word."

CELESTIAL SEASONINGS; RIGHT NOW, WE WANT THE MOON AND THE STARS TO ACCESSORIZE 
OUR HOMES. BUT WHAT'S ON THE HORIZON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 About the time a home furnishings trend shows up on a bathmat, it's washed up. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with heavenly objects. Not that you'd know it by scanning the stores 
and catalogues: Suns, moons and stars still fill the shelves and cover multiple 
pages. But such is the nature of these trends -- just when they're everywhere, 
they're goners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is post-peak," pronounces Raymond Berger, vice president of 
Plummer-McCutcheon, which gave two entire pages to the celestial theme in its 
most recent catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 During the decorating-down years (on average, people replace furniture only 1 
1/2 times during their lifetimes, designer Vladimir Kagan says), we freshen our 
nests with small decorative items. They are to furniture what accessories are 
to fashion -- affordably priced additions that stretch the life span of the 
major, expensive pieces. And they're the fuel that fires yard sales of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Where a furniture style can take five to 10 years to max out, a decorating 
theme might come and go in a matter of months. With two years on the scene, 
celestial items have had a long run. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no consensus on its exact flash point, but early signs of the 
celestial look include a snow globe at a German gift fair, a cotton throw at a 
New York gift show and needlepoint pillows at a New York craft fair. Within a 
few months of those isolated sightings in 1992, the sun, moon and stars motif 
began appearing on everything from clocks, dishes, candles, linens, napkin 
rings and watering cans to shower curtains. As prices go, the merchandise leans 
toward the low end. 
</P>
<P>
 If the celestial theme came out of the blue, the reasons for its popularity 
are equally obscure. The brilliant yellow and orange graphics on a dark blue 
background hardly enhance the favored furniture styles of the day, such as 
Mission, nor do they complement the reigning palette of faded colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps it has a sense of mysticism, or escape," Berger suggests. "When it 
was at its peak, we were in a recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Mystical iconography had another brief fling last winter when angels sprouted 
wings and took off, seemingly overnight. They rated a Time magazine cover 
before degenerating into swap-meet fodder. Now, though, angels appear to be 
getting a second life. Moons, stars and suns in pastels are being mixed with 
angels for some fairly rococo combos. American country is moving toward fussy 
Victorian style, and cherubs and moons fit right in with the lacy furbelows. 
</P>
<P>
 Design trends have traditionally trickled down from such high-end sources as a 
furniture style, a designer's line or even a museum show, but these days they 
often start, as the celestial theme did, at the mass-market level. 
</P>
<P>
 "The middle level is where all the action is," says color consultant Leatrice 
Eiseman of the Eiseman Center in Seattle. "We have a three-tier system of price 
levels. There is the high end, or designer realm, the middle ground and then 
the low end, discount-price level. Now that it is trendy and permissible to 
talk about saving money and shopping at Price Club and Target, there is a lot 
more attention being paid to the middle level. The mass market is getting more 
attention, and new things are being introduced at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunflowers were another graphic phenomenon that bloomed midfield, as part of 
the American country look of several years ago. Cows and gingham also figured 
into the farm scene, but sunflowers ultimately struck out on their own to 
bedeck rugs, teapots, vases, linens, coffee mugs and candlesticks. Some are 
designed to look like folk art, others are done in dark, muted colors to 
complement Mission-style furniture, and still others are as garishly bright and 
sickeningly sweet as daisies and happy faces -- two overused devices from 
decades past. The sunflowers are also starting to fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili peppers, ivy and fruit have also been popular in the middle-price range 
but will probably have disappeared by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 On an ascent are African-inspired items. Such fabrics as kente cloth have 
caught on in the textile and fashion markets and fueled a growing selection of 
African-like prints on linens and dinnerware. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think African-themed items will be a fairly important classification," says 
Mary Morris, vice president of Ross-Simons, publishers of the home-wares 
catalogue Anticipations. Society seems to moving toward a greater appreciation 
of ethnic influences, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinsons-May stores are already stocking dishes and table linens modeled on 
African mud-cloth designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the rise is a home-wares trend influenced by a furniture style 
referred to variously as Bloomsbury chic, palace trash, neo-ancestral and 
shabby chic. About two years ago, the severely trendy began collecting old 
chairs with moth-eaten, worn, velvet upholstery and displaying them just like 
that -- decrepitly shabby. The idea was to have furniture look as if it had 
been in the family for generations -- as in old family, old money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The decorative bits accompanying this theme are intentionally mismatched, worn 
and patched. The plates are different from the soup bowls, the mirrors need 
re-silvering, and the sofa cushions are upholstered in one fabric, the back and 
arms in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, furniture manufacturers are reproducing the look. "It's in the 
$1,000-sofa range now," Berger says. "I've seen slipcovers with incredibly 
creative mixes of fabrics. One piece of upholstery may have six fabrics on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelves of American Rag Maison et Cafe on South La Brea Avenue in Los 
Angeles are stocked with like-minded items. "We are going for a mixture of 
things, rather than one look. Stripes and patterns on pillows. We mix two 
different types of plates -- things from cafes and things from flea markets," 
owner Margot Werts says. 
</P>
<P>
 At stores with more moderately priced merchandise, wine glasses with 
mismatched stems come as a set and pillows have a mix of patterns. The Pottery 
Barn, for one, offers a sofa upholstered in ticking stripes combined with faded 
cabbage roses.

SHORT NOTICE; BLACK WOMEN ARE ENJOYING CROPPED STYLES THAT ARE EASY, FLATTERING 
AND AFFIRMATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They're cutting it close. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the lead of celebrities such as actress Halle Berry and pop singers 
Toni Braxton and Zhane, black women are cropping their mops. 
</P>
<P>
 Short 'dos are definitely a lock for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone coming in (to the shop) wants the Toni Braxton look or the Zhane 
look," said Brendolyn Davis, a hair designer at Moods International in 
Oceanside. "They're really cutting it down, above the ears, and going with a 
bob, short waves and pin curls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shags, twists and short dreads are popular, too," she added. All were visible 
at the World International Beauty Expo in Anaheim on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Less is best, if you want convenience, practicality and a flattering, 
individualized look. 
</P>
<P>
 Short styles require minimal maintenance -- several cuts, like the 
scalp-skimming Caesar, are wash and wear -- and there is little use for 
chemical relaxers that can break the hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the styles accentuate the eyes and the lines of the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "The styles are also more professional and often times you only need to go to 
a barber, not a stylist," said Davis, who has been in the beauty business for 
11 years, working in salons in Orange and San Diego counties before moving to 
Moods. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like braids, cropped cuts and naturals are an affirmation of black 
culture, another way for blacks to celebrate and unite in their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, it has been considered undesirable to sport short, nappy 
styles, which has prompted the majority of black women to relax their hair, 
grow it long or weave in extensions, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, naturals and crops are a chic, accepted alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting hair short "is a trend, but it does have Afrocentric roots," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to rappers Ice Cube and Snoop Doggy Dog, men are reviving the Afro. 
It's a throwback to the '70s, when the bushy mane was not only the style of the 
decade, but a political statement as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Longish Afros even took on the identities of their wearers, like activist 
Angela Davis, the character Linc, portrayed by Clarence Williams III on the 
television drama "Mod Squad" and the stylings of the family R&B group, the 
Sylvers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the '90s version of the Afro is less full and much less political. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just really retro," Davis said. "Afros are just a fad, a style, not a 
political statement."

BY DESIGN; THE CLASS OF '94; DESIGNERS: THREE FROM L.A.'S NEW CROP STAND READY 
TO UNLEASH THEIR FLASH AND SPLASH ON THE REAL WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of sketching, pattern-making, fitting and sewing, students at 
L.A.'s design schools got a chance to strut their stuff recently at 
semester-end fashion shows. Now, it's time to test their skills in the real 
world. These three young designers -- from the Fashion Institute of Design & 
Merchandising, Otis College of Art and Design, and L.A. Trade Tech -- seem to 
have promising futures. 
</P>
<P>
 FIDM: Janet Baluyot's first creation was a Diane von Furstenberg-style wrap 
dress for her Barbie doll. A few years later, she made herself a cotton twill 
tank dress that was, in a word, "awful." But thanks to a family of seamstresses 
and summers spent in Italy, Baluyot's skills improved considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 For her final school project this spring, she went Hollywood, creating a 
wardrobe for a fictional Academy Awards-bound starlet. "When her name is 
announced as a winner," Baluyot says, "she snaps on the skirt -- which has a 
long train that trails behind her." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by designers as diverse as Jean-Louis Scherrer and Anna Sui, Baluyot, 
who's already snagged a job with a junior-sportswear company, spends her days 
working on very simple clothing -- "totally opposite" of the elegantly 
flamboyant styles she loves. But who knows what the future may bring? 
</P>
<P>
 Otis: Sunita Linde came to Los Angeles from a tiny island off the coast of 
British Columbia to study photography. Unfortunately, at the end of her 
freshman year, Otis closed its photo department. "I figured, 'I can sew,' " she 
says, and she promptly changed her major to fashion design. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise was that designing came so easily: "I don't want to sound 
arrogant. I was lucky." For someone who never thought about fashion, Linde bit 
off a big challenge for her final school project: a wedding dress she describes 
as "a big ol' cake." But not a piece of cake. Linde never mastered using a 
thimble, and after a considerable amount of sewing by hand, her fingers looked 
like tiny pin cushions. It didn't matter, she says: "I was faster without it."  
</P>
<P>
 Since graduating, Linde has been redoing her portfolio -- tearing out 
illustrations she did primarily for teachers, substituting ideas meant to 
satisfy only herself. "Now that I'm out of there, nobody can criticize my 
work," she says with a laugh. Only problem is, "I don't know what me is." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Trade Tech: Denise Taylor Brown started sewing when she was 12. By high 
school, she was staging her own fashion shows. A stint as a showroom model 
after graduation didn't lead -- as she had hoped -- to a career as a print 
model. "It wasn't a good time for African American models," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 So she concentrated on her job as a media buyer, wife and mother of two. But 
two years ago, with the "desire to fulfill a longtime dream," Brown enrolled in 
L.A. Trade Tech's fashion design program. She graduates this month, scoring an 
Honorable Mention for her final project, a suit made from mud cloth from Mali.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like the African influence -- cotton fabrics and vibrant colors," she says. 
What's out there now, she says, are garments much too traditional for African 
American women to wear to work: "They don't want to be classified in any 
particular way." 
</P>
<P>
 Through experimentation, Brown found that ethnic prints stitched into 
classically tailored and lined suits were more corporate-friendly. "I've seen 
it done on a small scale," says Brown, who has just landed a job at US Boys, a 
sportswear maker. "I want to mass-produce it."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Air, water and a piece of string. That's about all you'll need this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything tied up or down -- or made entirely of deja vu macrame -- tops the 
list of warm-weather essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawstring pants, apron dresses, skimpy club clothes, ventilated crochet tops 
and countless variations on the sneaker take the theme to heart. Even dress-up 
pumps with spike heels lace up the instep. And in the handbag department, the 
big thing is the "wallet on a string" -- a tiny purse with room for nothing 
more than a lipstick and a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimwear season brings back the itsy-bitsy string bikini, with triangle-shaped 
bras and bottoms. As with most retro trends, if you did it on the first 
go-round in the '70s, you're probably better off skipping it this time. The 
1994 incarnation is meant for skinny young things. MAUREEN SAJBEL

IT'S CLEAR AMERICA IS INDEED THE LAND OF THE PL8WRTR; TRENDS: PERSONALIZED 
LICENSE PLATES ARE THE TICKET ACROSS THE LAND. ARE THEY A STATEMENT OF 
INDIVIDUALITY OR MERELY VAIN PURSUIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM WALKER, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America, land of the free, is also the land of flirts, boasters, bullies and 
would-be comedians. Want proof? Hop in your car and go plate-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, some 10 million Americans pay their state governments up to $100 to 
stamp personal messages on their license plates. These "personalized" or 
"vanity" plates have proved to be cash cows, pouring $31 million a year into 
state coffers in California alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Personalized plates run from belligerent (IMAIM) to flippant (NOTUAGN) to 
downright pathetic (UNLOVED). Plate enthusiasts claim they've met, among 
others, an actress with IMAQT, a bodybuilder with HUMONGO, a rancher with 
N2SHEEP and an undertaker whose thought-provoking plates read YURNEXT. 
</P>
<P>
 "People sit alone on freeways and expressways, isolated," says Daniel 
Nussbaum, a writer and self-proclaimed "platehead" from Los Angeles. 
"Personalized plates are a way of breaking up the isolation, asserting identity 
and communicating something. I call it 'graffiti for the middle class.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nussbaum, plateheads have spawned an entire subculture, replete 
with its own language: "PL8SPK." His recent book by that name (HarperCollins 
West) consists of famous tales like "ROMYOH ANNDE JULYET" and "OEDIPUS" told 
entirely with existing personalized plates. Nussbaum says he has always been 
fascinated by this grass-roots form of language. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very particular format with very exact rules," he says. "Everyone 
gets seven spaces, and every plate has to be different. People go through all 
kinds of contortions to come up with funny plates." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Nussbaum says, there are 154 variations on "excellent" in 
California, and, ironically, about as many on "unique." He says he spotted his 
favorite plate of all fastened to a van carrying a group of sisters clad in 
habits. It read: NUNSRUS. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only government program I know of that lets you be creative," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jeff Minard, former president of the American License Plate 
Collectors Assn., the practice has spread to all the Canadian provinces, 
Australia, Austria and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Minard estimates that New Hampshire, with about 140,000 vanity plates, 
is still among the top 15 states, but California is the most represented, at 
1.4 million, followed by New York (800,000), Illinois (500,000), Texas 
(450,000) and Virginia (400,000). Nevada, he says, with 200,000, has the most 
plates per capita. 
</P>
<P>
 All these vanity plates present state officials with an interesting challenge: 
defining what is appropriate. "It could be Urdu and something gross, and they 
have to know about it," Minard says. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no official California censor, Evan Nossoff of the California 
Department of Motor Vehicles says he and his colleagues review each one of the 
183,000 annual applications. Often, he says, they consult one of several 
foreign dictionaries and read entries backward, as they would appear in 
rear-view mirrors (YOBTAF). Every year, he says, about 1% of the applications 
are deemed offensive, misleading or crude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to reject a handful each year," Nossoff says. "Most of them are 
variations on things we've rejected before, but there's always somebody who 
comes up with something new."  
</P>
<P>
 "People consistently push the bounds of free speech," says Michael Wiener, a 
state senator and plate enthusiast from Albuquerque, N.M. But, he adds, "If 
someone cares enough to take it to court, they usually win."  
</P>
<P>
 How long will this continue? 
</P>
<P>
 Nossoff says the market for seven-letter plates is declining. In its place, he 
says, are special plates issued by nonprofit organizations for fund-raising 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 For $20, Golden State motorists can own the new California Arts License Plate. 
The Yosemite plate is $50. Nossoff adds that New York has fought the slow 
decline in new applications by offering an eighth digit. "That opens up a whole 
new realm of personalized plates," he says. 
</P>

ARSENIO'S EXIT: A WRAP FOR RAP?; TELEVISION: URBAN-MUSIC RECORD EXECUTIVES FEAR 
THAT THE HOST'S EXIT FROM LATE NIGHT WILL MEAN CURTAINS FOR ARTISTS WHO AREN'T 
MAINSTREAM ENOUGH FOR LETTERMAN OR LENO. 
</P>

<P>
 When Arsenio Hall takes his final bow Friday night, record company executives 
fear that the curtain may also drop on urban-oriented music on the late-night 
talk-show circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at MCA, Epic and other labels said that for the past 5 1/2 years, 
the syndicated "Arsenio Hall Show" provided a valuable national outlet for 
urban music while other late-night hosts such as Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and 
David Letterman focused on more traditional, mainstream musical tastes.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really bummed," said Laura Hynes, vice president of artist development 
and media relations for Tommy Boy Records, a New York-based label specializing 
in rap and urban music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show helped break a lot of our artists -- Naughty by Nature, House of 
Pain, RuPaul, Queen Latifah," Hynes said. "Before this show, there was no 
national late-night outlet where a viewer could tune in to see happening music 
that appealed to the segment of the audience that liked rap or dance music." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Hall's ratings slipped in the last few years -- 24% in the last year 
alone -- these executives and other observers of the urban music scene 
maintained that his show never lost its status as a desired gig for rap and 
rhythm & blues artists to reach their core young audience. An appearance on the 
Hall show often translated into a boost in popularity and record sales -- as 
much as 400%, said Kim Jackwerth, director of television media for Epic. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, said Ernie Singleton, president of MCA Records' black music division, 
"the single best platform for urban music, even better than 'Soul Train,' 
'Showtime at the Apollo' or the occasional Leno and Letterman appearance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall not only gave visibility to established mainstream rappers and groups 
such as Salt-N-Pepa, Arrested Development and Queen Latifah, but also featured 
more controversial artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, 
Tupac Shakur and Ice T.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Hall quitting after Friday's show, the music industry is wondering 
if those artists will be able to "get busy" with Leno, Letterman or Hall's 
expected replacement, Jon Stewart of MTV. The opportunities to get a coveted 
slot on a late-night show will certainly be slimmer, they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller, music editor of the Source, a rap and hip-hop-oriented 
magazine, said, "The overall vibe of Arsenio's show was a party, and it was 
also family. It was a real symbol to appear on Arsenio's show. There is 
definitely not another late-night show that would devote an entire program to 
rap. I've seen that Jon Stewart has a lot of music acts on his (MTV) show and 
he feels very contemporary, but I doubt if any other show will be of Arsenio's 
essence." 
</P>
<P>
 Another executive who asked not to be identified said that there was a 
perception in the music industry that Leno and Letterman were biased against 
rap and urban music acts. "They're white shows for white audiences," said the 
official. "Unless you have appeal to white people, you're not going to get a 
booking on those shows." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesperson for "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" disputed that claim and 
other perceptions that Leno placed less of a priority on urban-oriented music. 
"We were the first to have on R. Kelly," said the spokesperson. "In the past, 
we've had Gang Starr, TLC and a number of hip-hop artists. On June 2, we've got 
All 4 One booked." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesperson added that Leno's booking of rap and hip-hop artists would 
not change due to Hall's departure. A spokesman for Letterman could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marla Kell Brown, producer of "The Arsenio Hall Show," said she does not 
believe the other late-night programs are biased against urban artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, we were an alternative to Johnny Carson, who had a whole different 
audience and didn't necessarily speak to the younger generation," Brown said. 
"It's more an issue of age than of black and white. It's an issue of being 
uninformed." 
</P>
<P>
 Some urban artists will get shots on the Letterman and Leno shows, she 
predicted, "but many will not have a place to go. There are only so many slots 
available." And "the other shows are not going to change their format," she 
added. "If you try too hard to be what you're not, that looks strange, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Hall, after all, was only doing what came naturally to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that there was this misconception by the media that we were on 
the cutting edge," she said. "We just brought out what young America was 
listening to. In our first week, we had Bobby Brown on as a guest. He had the 
No. 1 song in the country then -- 'My Prerogative' -- but he had never been on 
a late-night show. There just wasn't a venue for artists like him to get their 
stuff out there. So we were not cutting edge. We were just reflecting the 
mainstream of young America." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That reflection extended beyond the music scene, the producer said. "There 
were actors and athletes that were very popular, but popular in a world that 
was different than the world populated by the producers of those other shows," 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 While somewhat pessimistic, many of the urban music executives said they were 
willing to give other talk shows the benefit of the doubt in terms of the 
booking of rap and hip-hop artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "These musicians will have a place to go, but it just won't be the same," said 
Lisa Jefferson, manager of West Coast press and artist development for Elektra 
Entertainment. "I don't know how hard it will be for an artist to get on. It 
may take a Top 10 single. With Arsenio, if he knew the group, he would put them 
on. Plus, it won't be the same camaraderie. He will definitely be missed."

CHOOSE YOUR OIL; FAT'S BAD FOR YOU, SALT'S BAD FOR YOU AND THE TUBS ARE 
ENVIRONMENTALLY INCORRECT. STILL, WE WONDERED: IS ANY POPCORN WORTH IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 OK, so popcorn can kill you. This is not much of an alarm in a city where, the 
Surgeon General has determined, simply breathing or driving in certain 
neighborhoods is hazardous to your health. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie theaters reacted fairly swiftly to the news from the Center for Science 
in the Public Interest that, thanks to the use of coconut oil, a tub of movie 
popcorn has more calories and fat than a tub of Big Macs. Ads and banners 
quickly appeared, with most theater chains proudly proclaiming that they have a 
tradition of using relatively safer canola oil that spans, oh, at least a 
couple of weeks now; that they'd never dream of doing something that would harm 
the welfare of their valued patrons; that they've never had a contingency plan 
of creating wider seats for their popcorn-glomming customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the spin control has been executed, the question is, does this stuff 
really taste good enough to justify the early grave to which we moviegoers have 
been duly consigned? To find out, we conducted an experiment so precise and 
definitive that the Center for Science in the Public Interest would be green 
with envy. Methods and procedures 
</P>
<P>
 Eight upstanding citizens with no outstanding police warrants and nothing 
better to do on a Saturday afternoon gathered at an unmarked Hollywood 
apartment complex. With the crack precision of a military operation, we 
descended upon theaters representing eight theater chains, purchasing both 
buttered and unbuttered popcorn and returned to said location, where we 
proceeded to eat ourselves sick. As a control for the experiment, we had a bag 
of Chesters Butter Pop, which one of the group sneaks into every movie he 
attends. 
</P>
<P>
 Total amount spent: $56. For popcorn . As one lab rat -- er, participant -- 
opined, "Think of all the Chinese food that you could've bought for that. Why 
can't you do stories like that? " Results and observations 
</P>
<P>
 Though most chains have switched to canola oil (Cineplex Odeon being the lone 
standout), their popping methods actually do result in varying flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 We were fortunate to have in our midst Joseph, who, having served as a local 
theater manager, is as knowledgeable about movie popcorn as he is about movies 
themselves. Among his insights: Snacks at Hollywood theaters are the most 
expensive around (the Valley is the cheapest); some theaters don't pop their 
popcorn, preferring to have it imported in giant plastic bags instead; and -- 
most distressingly -- the theater he worked at has been known to have had a 
vermin problem. More you do not want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are our thoughts on the chains' popcorn, beginning with the theater 
with the popcorn the group enjoyed the most and declining to the product that 
we ate only out of a sense of duty to you, the reader. (Note: Alonso was the 
only person to use the food-critic term "texture" in describing the popcorn. We 
elected not to ostracize him, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Pacific (El Capitan). All save one of us found the El Capitan's popcorn to 
be the downright tastiest, even though they have switched over to the 
ostensibly safer canola oil. It was also the most intrinsically salty, as well. 
Which didn't bother anyone in our sure-to-perish-of-high-blood-pressure 
aggregation. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Cinema (Galaxy). Kevin, who purchased this, said GCC's popcorn was 
the freshest, hottest and most flavorful corn right off the counter, and 
declared it his favorite. The rest of us were content to name it our second 
favorite: The salt produced a slightly metallic tang to its taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * Landmark/Goldwyn (Samuel Goldwyn Pavilion). All agreed that this was the 
crispiest, and could scarcely tell the difference between the buttered and 
unbuttered corn. Sadly, no one had a joke for this corn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cineplex Odeon (Showcase). How about a little popcorn with your grease? This 
weighed twice as much as other similarly sized bags, thanks to the liberal 
slathering of golden glop -- Cineplex is the only chain still pushing the 
dreaded coconut oil. "It's slipping around in my mouth -- I can't get my teeth 
on it," groused Robert. Alonso described its "aggressively faux-buttery 
greasiness" and added, "I saw 'The Piano' there and some guy had a seizure -- I 
thought it was just the finger-cutting scene." It was anecdotes like that that 
made us decide not to ostracize Alonso. That, and the fact that it was his 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 * United Artists (Marina del Rey Cinema). Maybe their popcorn is good when 
it's not burnt to a crisp. We'll never know -- ours was inedibly charred. 
Flavored topping didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mann (Chinese). Of the theaters we sampled, Mann's Chinese was the only one 
to offer air-popped corn, which all of us agreed was just like eating warm 
styrofoam. On the other hand, Cindy sagely observed, "It's responsible of them. 
I'm glad they offer it, so someone on a diet can have something to eat." We 
were underwhelmed by their regular corn, though, which led Alonso to theorize, 
"This must be why Mann theaters always have the most popcorn on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 * AMC (Cecchi Gori Fine Arts). You'd expect a Saturday afternoon to be a brisk 
time for popcorn business, and that it would be fairly fresh, right? AMC's was 
the stalest of the corns we sampled, and was also pretty greasy. Which didn't 
surprise Joseph: "Whenever I go to an AMC theater and they give me a Moviegoer 
Popcorn Coupon, I always give it away. I always think, 'Oh, man, I hope it's 
not a popcorn coupon, I hope it's for a drink.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Laemmle (Sunset 5). Resident connoisseur Joseph, before any results were in, 
declared this his least favorite when it comes to popcorn, and the taste test 
proved him correct. It wasn't fresh, and there was some sort of chalky 
substance on it that wasn't particularly pleasant. How ironic that the chain 
that shows the most tasteful movies offers the most tasteless popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chesters Butter Pop (Ralph's). "Vomit," Cindy said while reading the 
nutritional information on the bag. "It has 160 calories (per serving) -- 110 
of those are from fat!" Otherwise, the snack's "bizarre chemical taste" was 
assailed. "I like the bizarre chemical taste," shrugged Chesters' sole 
apologist. In his defense, it certainly is cheaper (99 a bag) than theater 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Our work done, we tackled important attendant side issues. Side Issue No. 1: 
Extra butter ?  
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetic issues aside, the butter or oil or WD-40 used by theaters 
unappetizingly shrivels up popped kernels like so many well-tanned Beverly 
Hills trophy wives -- the extra glop is disgustingly greasy. Which would make 
holding hands at the movies a most unromantic proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, in our test, most of us liked the unbuttered corn better anyway, and 
after the respective tubs of corn had been sitting around for a while, the 
flavor of the buttered corn was indistinguishable from the non-buttered. Which 
led us to the conclusion that, apparently, the stuff they pour on the popcorn 
is the same stuff they pop it in. Which means you're just getting more goop in 
your system, the popcorn equivalent of Jolt Cola. If you're that contemptuous 
of your arteries, may we suggest the book "Final Exit." Side Issue No. 2: Cups 
or bags? 
</P>
<P>
 Bags, we're told, are environmentally friendly. We don't care: Cups (or, for 
the more ambitious appetite, tubs) are easier to handle and don't spill as 
easily. Only one participant in our experiment preferred bags, with the weak 
defense: "When you drop a bag, it doesn't roll away." Which the rest of us 
quickly turned into a plus on the cup side: That way, no one knows it was you 
who dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, of the theaters in our survey, only Laemmle and United Artists -- two 
of our least favorite poppers of corn -- offer cups. Side Issue No. 3: What is 
it with Cineplex Odeon? 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, are these guys touchy. A routine call to the Showcase Theater to confirm 
that they still use coconut oil resulted in three employees passing the buck, 
followed by a very officious "We have no comment on that." Phoning Cineplex 
Odeon's local offices produced a little more runaround, concluded with a 
referral to the corporate offices -- in Toronto.  
</P>
<P>
 And all this wasn't even necessary, since Cineplex Odeon has gone to the 
extravagant length of issuing a pamphlet to theater patrons, "Let's pop a few 
myths about Moviegoers' most beloved snack." It shreds the Center for Science's 
study, then goes on to say, in essence, "Sure, it's bad for you, but so what? 
You like it and if you don't buy it from us, we're going under." Conclusions 
</P>
<P>
 The Times had best let me expense six months at Jenny Craig.

 New Grammy Categories: The National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences has 
added six new categories to its annual Grammy Awards, including separate album 
categories for pop, rock, country and R&B. Those categories will be in addition 
to current awards recognizing performances on singles or separate album tracks. 
Other new awards include best pop vocal collaboration, which will separate 
performances by artists who do not normally record together from the pop duo or 
group performance category; and best Latin jazz, which will be an album award. 
In other changes, the contemporary jazz, jazz vocal and large jazz ensemble 
awards will now recognize entire albums, not singles or tracks. The total 
number of annual Grammy Awards is now 87.

 * 'Crow' Soars: The box-office success of Brandon Lee's "The Crow" helped 
catapult the film's soundtrack last week into the No. 1 spot on the pop album 
chart. The eclectic rock collection -- which features songs by the Stone Temple 
Pilots, Nine Inch Nails, Medicine and Rage Against the Machine -- sold an 
estimated 125,000 albums at stores across the nation. That's a 40% sales gain 
over the previous week, when it debuted at No. 5 on the chart. TELEVISION

 Trekkers Rule L.A. Sweeps: Monday night's series finale of "Star Trek: The

million local viewing homes, accounting for 32% of those watching TV at the 
time. The closest competitor was the season finale of ABC's "NYPD Blue," which 
drew about 1 million Los Angeles viewing homes. Overall, the syndicated "Star 
Trek: TNG" averaged 27% of the available audience in the 13 major markets in 
which it aired Monday, also winning its time period in other top markets,

 * The $8 Movie: Just as the National Assn. of Theater Owners is crowing about 
how the average price of movie tickets is somewhat lower than $5, two of the 
nation's bigger theater circuits have raised prices in Manhattan from $7.50 to 
$8. It's typical for theater chains to raise prices just before the start of a 
major movie-going season, and this week marks the beginning of the summer movie 
rush. The $8 ticket establishes a new high for a movie ticket in the United 
States. For now, the $8 ticket is only in Manhattan, but other markets have 
seen some increases in the order of 25 cents, to $6.50. Sources in the Los 
Angeles area, where the top ticket price is $7.50, said no boost is 
contemplated. THE ARTS

 Good Opera News: At its annual meeting Tuesday, the San Francisco Opera 
proclaimed 1993 a major financial and artistic success. Record ticket revenues 
of nearly $17.5 million, a reduction in company expenses and a special 
fund-raising campaign contributed to a $1.3 million-surplus for the fiscal year 
that ended Jan. 31. In addition, a new, five-year agreement was signed with the 
orchestra and chorus last year, as well as a six-year extension of the contract 
of General Director Lotfi Mansouri. QUICK TAKES

POP MUSIC REVIEW; WEDDING PRESENT: EDGY ROCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fascination of the English group the Wedding Present is like that of a 
natural disaster. The quartet's high-tension pop threatens to blow apart and 
unleash torrents of destructive emotion at any moment, but the group sits on 
the edge and plays off that threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooted in the malcontent drone of Joy Division and the pretty yet biting 
melodiousness of the Smiths, the Wedding Present adds a constant buzz of rhythm 
guitar and comes up with rock that's ready to snap. 
</P>
<P>
 The band drew a sizable following to the Whisky on Tuesday for its first Los 
Angeles show in two years, and it played with the irritated edge that has set 
it apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer David Gedge delivered his witty lines in a thick Leeds accent, blurting 
the lyrics in deep, annoyed tones and following them up with impatient grunts 
and occasional yowls. Each instrument rang out clear and defined, while edgy 
guitar hurried the pop-based songs along. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohio-based indie band Scrawl opened the show with powerful harmonies whose 
blend of the eerie and the pretty bubbled with underlying anger. The band 
unleashed its contained aggression in small doses, like surprise attacks; a 
perfectly unpredictable prelude for the headliners.LORRAINE ALI

 Teacher's lawsuits -- A story in the May 19 San Gabriel Valley section about 
lawsuits filed by teacher Zephyr Tate-Mann against the Pomona Unified School 
District incorrectly implied that the district agrees that it has a tracking 
system for students but defends the system. "The district does maintain certain 
records," said district legal counsel Adrienne D. Konigar. "But do believe our 
records will not show any system of tracking."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; FIRE OFFICIAL DISCIPLINED FOR RALLY APPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-ranking Fire Department official was disciplined this week after two 
Westminster councilmen complained of his involvement in a political recall 
effort there. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Gary Olson was told in a personnel hearing Monday that he used 
poor judgment when he appeared at a weekend rally in Westminster, supporting 
the recall, in a Long Beach-owned vehicle, Fire Chief Harold Omel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city attorney ruled that (Olson) wasn't misusing a city car, but his 
actions were inappropriate," Omel said. Officials would not disclose details of 
the disciplinary action.  
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Councilmen Tony Lam and Craig Schweisinger, two of the targets of 
the recall effort, had asked that Olson be fired. "He appropriated taxpayer 
dollars (by using a city car), even if he thinks he hasn't," Schweisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson appeared at the rally in his red, unmarked city vehicle, which was 
assigned to him for the weekend because he was on call. Shortly after the 
rally, Olson was called in to help put out the Seal Beach Pier fire. About 60 
off-duty Long Beach firefighters also participated in the rally.  
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort -- aimed at four of the five council members -- was 
initiated after the city reorganized the fire department last year and laid off 
six firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Olson) used bad judgment, but he didn't do anything wrong," Omel 
said. "It's his constitutional right to be involved in politics during his free 
time." EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: BELLFLOWER; COUNCIL REJECTS BALLOT MEASURE TO WEIGH TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council narrowly rejected a proposed ballot measure that would have 
sought voter opinion on whether to keep the city's 5% utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority said the measure, which would have cost nearly $20,000, 
would be a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have qualified council people and we're elected to make decisions," said 
Councilman Ray T. Smith, who joined Mayor Ken Cleveland and Councilman Randy 
Bomgaars in rejecting the proposal. "That's what a representative government 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Art Olivier, who opposes the tax, had proposed the advisory measure 
for the November ballot. He said he wanted to poll the community before the 
council decides in December whether to continue the tax, which currently pays 
for law enforcement. "It's necessary to allow people to be part of the 
political process," said Olivier. "The way to validate this tax is to let 
people vote on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Gilson agreed. "I feel the voters should always have a 
chance to decide on any tax," she said. "They weren't given a chance on this 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax -- Bellflower's first -- was narrowly approved by the council 
in October. The tax costs the average household about $5 a month and is 
expected to generate about $2.5 million a year to pay for more sheriff's 
deputies and other city services. JOHN POPE

 The coffeehouse that helped start a mini-revolt against the city's strict 
entertainment licensing laws for alcohol-free establishments has gone out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Pinn, owner of the Habitat coffeehouse on 7th Street, said he was 
forced to close this month after losing money steadily since opening the small 
storefront shop in December. "I'm through with the coffeehouse thing," Pinn 
said. "There's no money in it." EMILY ADAMS

 The question of how to save young people from turmoil on the streets arises 
with some frequency at City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the answer appeared to be basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 A solid, sweaty game of basketball, played around midnight, could be the 
saving grace for hundreds of young people who might otherwise be on the 
streets, council members agreed Tuesday as they unanimously voted to support a 
Midnight Basketball League in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly the kind of program we need. And we need more of them," said 
Councilman Thomas J. Clark as he congratulated Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord 
for helping bring the program to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 8 to 0 to support the program, which is funded with private 
donations. Councilman Ray Grabinski was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The program includes seminars before each game on such topics as job skills, 
interview techniques, conflict resolution and self-improvement. The sessions 
will be from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. -- prime time for young people to get into 
trouble, police say -- and league scouts will recruit players from the court 
system, schools and playgrounds. Games will be open to men and women 17 to 25 
years old.  
</P>
<P>
 The league, organized by a new chapter of the nonprofit National Assn. of 
Midnight Basketball Leagues Inc., is patterned after similar programs in other 
urban areas. Teams will be formed this fall, and the first game is expected to 
be played in January, 1995, said Phillippa Lewis, director of the Long Beach 
chapter. EMILY ADAMS

IN SHARP SHIFT FROM '92, REP. TUCKER NOW FACES INEXPERIENCED RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) inched past Compton 
schools trustee Lynn Dymally in a bitter Democratic primary for the 37th 
Congressional District that featured name-calling and public shouting matches. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Tucker appears headed for a smoother ride. His opponent, Rancho 
Palos Verdes businessman Lew Prulitsky, has no political experience, and so far 
has offered mild criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Prulitsky, 61, says Tucker is unresponsive, rarely shows up in the district, 
and has failed to introduce significant legislation. Tucker, 36, a former 
Compton mayor, said he visits the district three or four times a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker says that during his two years in the House he has worked to keep the 
Long Beach Naval shipyard open, to bring a job training center to Wilmington 
and a light-rail manufacturing plant to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be seen is whether an FBI bribery probe into Tucker and other 
former Compton officials will hurt his reelection hopes. Tucker said his 
financial records have been subpoenaed. He denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the primary will face Libertarian Guy Wilson of San Pedro in the 
November general election. There are no Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>

 33rd DISTRICT:

Vernon, Florence, Walnut Park, parts of Downey, Los Angeles, East Los Angeles ) 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), 52, is considered a heavy 
favorite to recapture the seat she won two years ago. She faces only one 
challenger in the primary, a political newcomer making his first bid for 
elective office, and there are no Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Roybal-Allard's Democratic challenger is Charles E. Green, 73, a 
self-described human-rights advocate who says he served 10 years on a senior 
citizens' advisory panel to the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face Peace and Freedom candidate Kermit Booker, 57, a teacher 
at Lynwood High School.

 Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Pico Rivera), who is seeking his seventh term, is 
unopposed in the Democratic primary. Torres will face two Whittier challengers 
in November: businessman Albert J. Nunez, a Republican, and Libertarian Carl M. 
(Marty) Swinney.

 Freshman Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) is waging his first reelection 
campaign even while he recuperates from prostate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, 62, underwent surgery Monday in Washington, six weeks after doctors 
found evidence of the cancer during a routine examination. "It was caught in a 
very early and treatable stage," said Horn's spokeswoman, Mary Hinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn faces one primary challenger, John B. Duke, a quality assurance 
consultant with Control Design Systems in Los Angeles. Duke, 49, is a newcomer 
to politics.

 The winner will face challengers from three parties in November: Democrat 
Peter Mathews, Libertarian Lester W. Mueller and Peace and Freedom candidate 
Richard K. Green.

</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) has no opponent in the Republican primary. He will 
face two challengers in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Royce's Democratic opponent will be R.O. (Bob) Davis, 57, a contractor from 
Buena Park making his second run at elective office. In 1986, Davis ran 
unsuccessfully in the 33rd state Senate District. Libertarian Jack Dean also is 
running.

6 ASSEMBLY RACES ARE ATTRACTING LITTLE NOTICE; PRIMARY: DEMOCRATIC REMATCH IN 
52ND DISTRICT HAS BEEN QUIETER THAN EXPECTED. INCUMBENTS HAVE SLIGHT OPPOSITION 
OR NONE IN OTHER LOCAL CONTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND and PSYCHE PASCUAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The race for the 52nd Assembly District had the makings of a true political 
thriller, featuring two candidates whose public lives have been peppered by 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) has been widely condemned by 
Compton civic leaders for supporting a state takeover of the insolvent Compton 
school district last year. Former Compton City Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore, 
one of the three challengers in the Democratic primary, has provoked criticism 
that she is a political opportunist who surfaces at high-profile incidents 
involving African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential for a raucous campaign filled with accusations, the 
contest has instead turned into a real sleeper with less than two weeks before 
the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is one of six Assembly contests quietly being waged in the Southeast. 
In four others, incumbents face no opposition for their party's nomination. A 
fifth incumbent faces only a modest challenge from a businessman with limited 
campaign funds.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 52nd District, there have been no forums and little campaigning. 
Murray, 63, said he has been speaking to church and community groups when he 
flies home from Sacramento at the end of each week. He routinely makes the trip 
as part of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray already is predicting victory over Moore and a third candidate, Los 
Angeles businessman Stephen Hamlin, 29. The winner of the primary will face 
Republican Richard A. Rorex, a Gardena engineer, in the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've won three elections fairly handily," said Murray, who beat Moore two 
years ago and is seeking his fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 46, says she's had little time to campaign because she has been caring 
for her ailing mother in Ventura County. Moore said she had not planned to 
enter the race until she received numerous phone calls from residents 
complaining that Murray had lost touch with the district, which covers Compton, 
Lynwood, Paramount, Gardena and part of south Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willard Murray wants to sit back and be a dictator, with no proven record," 
said Moore, referring to Murray's support for state involvement in Compton 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said the state takeover should be considered one of his significant 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Murray sponsored legislation granting the Compton school system an 
emergency, multimillion-dollar bailout loan. The district fell under state 
control as a condition of the loan. School board members denounced the state 
intervention, arguing that it was wrong to usurp local control, but Murray said 
the move was necessary to salvage a district in financial and academic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's critics portray him as an aloof legislator unconcerned with his 
constituents' problems. His opponents point out that Murray received the lowest 
rating among 78 Assembly members in a recent survey by California Journal, a 
magazine that covers state politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, released in March, was sent to nearly 1,800 state politicians and 
their staffs and to journalists. Legislators were ranked on integrity, 
intelligence, effectiveness and other criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray dismissed the findings, pointing out that less than 17% of those polled 
actually returned the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore also has political liabilities. She is an alleged target in an FBI 
bribery probe dating to her time as a Compton city councilwoman. Moore said she 
has not been contacted by federal authorities and knows nothing of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton's close-knit political world, she has been condemned at times by 
those who say she has readily exploited tragedies, particularly those involving 
African Americans, for her own advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time candidate Hamlin, meanwhile, believes he offers a fresh alternative 
for voters. A resident of southern Los Angeles, Hamlin said he is walking door 
to door in the district to highlight his platform, which calls for improved 
schools, more jobs and police reform. "I won't say I'm very well-known right 
now, but I'm building up a lot of support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southeast-area Assembly races: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 54th District 
</P>
<P>
 (Long Beach, Hawaiian Gardens, Signal Hill, San Pedro, Catalina Island, Rancho 
Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, portions of Palos Verdes 
Estates, Wilmington.) Two Republican candidates are running in the primary for 
the chance to face Democratic incumbent Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) in 
November. Karnette faces no opposition in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall, 47, and Rolling Hills Estates 
restaurateur Jeffrey Earle, 35, are seeking the GOP nod. Both candidates have 
lined up high-profile endorsements. Former California Gov. George Deukmejian 
backs Kuykendall, and former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese supports Earle. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seeking the seat are Libertarian candidate Alan Carlan and Peace and 
Freedom candidate Patrick John McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 55th District 
</P>
<P>
 (Long Beach, Compton, Carson, Rancho Dominguez, Harbor Gateway, Harbor City, 
portions of Wilmington.)  
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson) appears headed for reelection in this 
heavily Democratic district. McDonald is the lone candidate in the Democratic 
primary and will face only a Libertarian candidate, Daniel Dalton, in November. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 56th District 
</P>
<P>
 (Cerritos, Long Beach, Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens, Bellflower, Artesia, 
Downey.)  
</P>
<P>
 Three GOP candidates are fighting it out for the chance to face Assemblyman 
Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), who has no opposition in the primary.  
</P>
<P>
 Epple has served in the Assembly since 1988 and believes he stands a good 
chance of being reelected to a fourth term because the majority of voters in 
the district are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidates are all Cerritos residents. Phillip Hawkins, 50, a 
real estate broker and contractor, is perhaps the best-known of the three. He 
waged an unsuccessful battle two years ago to unseat Epple. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel (Boone) Wong, 52, a family physician and former Cerritos city 
councilman, is making his second bid for the Republican nomination, which he 
lost to Hawkins two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinod Dave, 53, a hotel owner, acknowledges he lacks name recognition but has 
relied on ties to local business leaders to support his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian Arthur M. Hays is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 58th District 
</P>
<P>
 (Norwalk, Montebello, Pico Rivera, Santa Fe Springs, South El Monte, Whittier 
, unincorporated areas of South Whittier and Los Nietos.) Incumbent Grace 
Napolitano (D-Norwalk) has a lock on the Democratic primary. She faces two 
opponents in the November general election. Republican James Brett Marymee, 30, 
an aerospace engineer who works for Northrop Corp., is making his first run at 
public office after serving in the Republican Central Committee for the 58th 
District. Libertarian John P. McCready also is running. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 60th District 
</P>
<P>
 (La Mirada, Whittier, La Habra Heights, Diamond Bar, Walnut, West Covina, 
Covina, Pomona, Rowland Heights, Valinda, Hacienda Heights, Industry . )  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) faces a weak challenge from 
mortgage broker Robert L. Smith in the Republican primary. Smith has raised 
little money and lacks the endorsements of Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Andrew M. (Andy) Ramirez and Libertarian Michael L. Welte are running 
unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong Republican registration in the district makes Horcher the favorite in 
November.

LONGTIME SENATOR FACES 3 CHALLENGERS; ELECTION: OPPONENTS IN RECENTLY REDRAWN 
DISTRICT STRESS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN EFFORT TO UNSEAT RALPH C. DILLS, WHOSE 
POLITICAL CAREER DATES TO 1938. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo), who has served longer than any 
lawmaker in California history, is hoping to win a seat in a newly drawn 
district where he is relatively unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills faces three challengers in the 28th District, which stretches from Long 
Beach to Venice. He lost much of his existing district when reapportionment 
scrambled the political landscape two years ago, forcing him to move his voting 
residence from Gardena to El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Southeast-area Senate race, Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Montebello) is seeking election in a redrawn district but faces no 
opposition in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that Dills, 84, can expect to maintain a stronghold in the 28th 
District's inland areas, including Compton, Carson and Wilmington. He has 
represented those areas at some point in his legislative and judicial career, 
which dates to 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 But by his own account, Dills is not known to as many as two-thirds of the 
voters in the 28th District. Many of Dills' billboards, with the slogan "Too 
Old to Quit" and a picture of him playing the saxophone, were placed in the 
beach cities that form the spine of the redrawn district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fewer people know who I am than normal," said the gravel-voiced senator. 
"That's a disadvantage that I have to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills challengers are Torrance Councilman George Nakano, Venice attorney Mike 
Sidley and Manhattan Beach real estate broker Jo Ann Rodda. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills has tried to use his longevity as an asset. He helped establish Cal 
State Long Beach and the State Teachers Retirement System. During World War II, 
he refused to support the creation of Japanese internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people have any judgment, they will know that just because you are old, it 
should not be a negative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the campaign also has centered on the environment, and the candidates 
are hoping that a strong environmental stand resonates with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills promotes his opposition to oil field development in state tidelands. He 
points out that he has been praised by other senators for getting approval from 
the Government Organization Committee, which he chairs, for a ban on new oil 
drilling in state waters. And in a campaign brochure he cites legislation he is 
writing to save redwoods. 
</P>

 Nakano, 58, has attacked Dills' environmental record, including his acceptance 
this year of $2,500 in contributions from oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have much conviction in what he is doing," said Nakano, a former 
school administrator. "His actions are entirely political." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano trumpets his endorsement from the Sierra Club and the California League 
of Conservation Voters. If elected, Nakano would be the first Asian American in 
the Senate since the 1970s. He is expected to get strong support in Torrance 
and among Asian American groups, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nakano, like Dills, has little name recognition in the beach cities, which 
have 37% of the Democrats in the district.

<P>
 Sidley, 32, a member of the Los Angeles County Environmental Crimes Sentencing 
Task Force, says that he will fight for funding of the Santa Monica Bay 
Restoration Project, a bay cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodda, 53, is running on a platform of legal reform after a bitter divorce 
four years ago. Her campaign calls for removing divorce from the courts and 
putting it in the hands of a government agency with no fees. She also proposes 
that the California State Bar be replaced by a consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the primary will face Republican lawyer David Barrett Cohen, who 
is unopposed in his party's race; Neal Arvid Donner of Los Angeles, a 
Libertarian Party candidate, and Cindy V. Henderson of Los Angeles, a Peace and 
Freedom Party challenger.  
</P>
<P>
 In the other state Senate race, Calderon has a lock on his party's nomination 
because he faces no opposition to represent the 30th District, which includes 
Bell Gardens, Huntington Park, South Gate, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier and 
Calderon's home town of Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon decided to run for the seat when his current political turf, the 26th 
District, was cut in half during reapportionment. Montebello, Pico Rivera and 
Whittier are the only cities that overlap the two districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon is seeking his second term in the Senate. He also spent eight years 
in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 He will face one of two Republican candidates in the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Araceli Gonzalez, 24, a theater group manager from Cudahy, and Ken Gow, 77, a 
retired Rockwell International engineer from Whittier, characterized themselves 
as conservative Republicans who favor less regulation for businesses.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WATER DEPARTMENT OWES REFUNDS TO HOMEOWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not often that the Long Beach Water Department delivers money to its 
customers, but a billing error that officials recently discovered could bring a 
$10 refund to about 11,200 homeowners throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is issuing the refunds to homeowners who were overcharged on 
their 1992-93 property tax bill by the Central Basin Municipal Water District, 
which serves most Southeast-area cities and served parts of Long Beach 30 years 
ago.The central district inadvertently charged some Long Beach property owners 
an extra service fee by using out-of-date maps, said Robert W. Cole, general 
manager of the Long Beach department. Apparently, a consultant to the central 
water district mistakenly used historical maps for the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a mystery," Cole said. "We weren't sure whether the consultant 
got the wrong (maps) from the county or mistakenly used his own that were out 
of date." 
</P>
<P>
 After Long Beach officials were alerted to the error, they negotiated with the 
central district to return the extra $112,000 to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Central district officials were not able to determine exactly which areas of 
the city were overcharged, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners can check their 1992-93 property tax bill for a service listed as 
"CBMWD-Standby." If the charge appears, send a photocopy of the bill to the 
Long Beach Water Department, attention property tax refund, 1800 E. Wardlow 
Road, Long Beach 90807. 
</P>
<P>
 Any refunds not claimed by Dec. 31, 1994, will be used for water conservation 
programs in Long Beach, Cole said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two unrelated lawyers named Polsky who have been warring in the courts over 
use of that surname may have found an uneasy compromise. At least the signs 
point that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Polsky, a Long Beach lawyer who is running for Municipal Court 
judge, has put up new campaign signs around town, including his first name. 
</P>
<P>
 And Trudy Polsky, a real estate attorney and Long Beach City College trustee, 
has put her lawsuit on the back burner -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Friction between the Polskys began when Alexander Polsky posted signs around 
town advertising "Polsky . . . Municipal Court Judge." Trudy Polsky said he was 
attempting to cash in on her name recognition and filed a lawsuit, asking that 
he be forced to include his first name. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudy Polsky said she has taken her motion off the court's calendar. EMILY

COVER STORY; VIRTUAL INTEGRATION; HIGH-TECH VIDEO SYSTEM CONNECTS LATINO PUPILS 
IN NORWALK AND WHITE COUNTERPARTS IN LA MIRADA, BUT IS IT DESEGREGATION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME and JOHN D. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using a high-tech video system, Latino elementary-school students in Norwalk 
and white students in La Mirada are taking part in a groundbreaking, 
state-funded integration program that keeps students off buses and in 
neighborhood schools. The live, two-way transmissions allow more than 1,000 
students from four elementary schools to share -- over the airwaves -- lessons, 
activities, experiences and even friendships without ever leaving their 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts question whether the effort constitutes true integration, and 
whether the program should be paid for with state desegregation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program doesn't render the Norwalk schools any less Latino or the La 
Mirada schools any less white," said Los Angeles law professor James A. 
Kushner, who has written widely on the history of segregation and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local school officials insist, however, that their plan achieves integration 
and is a popular and relatively low-cost alternative to busing -- a form of 
desegregation that typically inspires heated opposition. The program also gives 
students an opportunity to learn about advanced video and computer equipment, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is the wave of the future and I think we're going in the right 
direction," said Ginger Shattuck, deputy superintendent for Norwalk-La Mirada 
Unified. "It is a way to allow students to come together through the most 
current technology we have. This is a natural evolution for integration, and 
for us, better than adopting a forced integration plan or another form of 
voluntary integration." 
</P>
<P>
 So far the state has contributed $2.82 million -- about 80% of the costs -- 
apparently without judging whether the program is true desegregation or a 
proper use of state funds designated for desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the state Department of Education said they have no role in 
approving desegregation programs. With no apparent scrutiny, the department 
forwards the funding request to the Legislature, which makes an annual 
appropriation for desegregation programs. The state controller's office, which 
actually pays the bills, ensures only that the money is spent as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The local desegregation program, which is called Global Studies for 
Multicultural Understanding and began this year, matches mostly Latino classes 
from Edmondson and Sanchez schools in Norwalk with mostly Anglo classes from 
Dulles and Gardenhill schools in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the video encounters, the third-, fourth- and fifth-graders 
meet in person for occasional activities, including field trips and art 
projects. And their teachers instruct them on appreciating different cultures 
and races. This emphasis on teaching cultural diversity, not the high-tech 
hardware, is the heart of the program, said program director Richard E. 
Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent school day, fourth-grader Gilbert Contreras, 10, from Edmondson 
School, was using the live, two-way link with Dulles School to plan part of a 
districtwide cultural festival. The June 9 gathering will feature plays, 
dances, songs and speeches by students from classes paired for the 
desegregation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras was explaining to Kevin Smith, 10, how to make a maraca by putting 
pebbles in a soft-drink can and then attaching the can to the end of a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras sat facing a customized cart holding a bank of portable video 
equipment. The gear included two 27-inch color monitors. On one monitor, 
Contreras could see himself and his own classmates. On the other monitor, he 
could see and hear the students from Dulles. The setup was the same on the 
other end of the transmission.  
</P>
<P>
 Students in the two classes have met in person three times. Each class has 
visited the other school and in December, the two classes traveled together to 
San Fernando Mission.  
</P>
<P>
 Another set of classes, from Sanchez and Gardenhill, used the video link to 
plan experiments for a joint field trip to coastal tide pools at Corona del 
Mar. Students teamed up with partners from the other school to conduct the 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're nice," said Crystal Gil, 9, of the students she met from La Mirada. 
She's learned that she and her video buddy, Holly, "have a lot in common. We 
both like strawberries. And we both like each other." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she likes the video connection because "you can meet new 
friends and you can keep in touch with different schools."  
</P>
<P>
 The level of contact between the classes has varied widely.  
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-graders at Sanchez School in Norwalk and Gardenhill School in La Mirada 
collaborated almost daily for several weeks to compose three mini-operas, with 
the assistance of a guest artist provided through the Music Center of Los 
Angeles County. Sometimes, however, the video contact is as little as 30 
minutes a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of face-to-face meetings also varies. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-May, some of the 38 paired classes had yet to meet in person during the 
yearlong experiment. Other classes have met about half a dozen times, which is 
closer to what district planners had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most students said they enjoyed using the video equipment, but added that it's 
hard to become friends via video alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that the transmissions are often grainy and the sound 
quality poor -- problems that technicians are supposed to correct this summer. 
"You can't get to know them that well because you can't see them right," said 
Andrew Velasquez, 9, of Sanchez Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the video interaction allows the children to ease painlessly into 
another world view, said Martin Carapia, a fourth-grade teacher in Norwalk. "A 
lot of kids feel comfortable where they are," he said. "Here, they are in their 
own surroundings, but they get a view of another culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it integration? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a far cry from the comprehensive, desegregation experience," said James 
S. Liebman, a professor at Columbia University School of Law and an expert on 
desegregation. "One of the things that you want from desegregation is for 
students to be able to gain respect for each other's entire situation. What you 
can get from an image of a student is such a small proportion of what that 
student's life is about." 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have rejected similar desegregation proposals, including a Texas plan 
to desegregate via closed-circuit television, said Gary Orfield, director of an 
ongoing Harvard University desegregation study. A Colorado plan to desegregate 
by having students spend half the school day together also was ruled inadequate 
by the federal courts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Norwalk-La Mirada is under no court order. School district officials made 
the decision to embark upon their desegregation program without prodding from 
parents, politicians or courts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of their objectives was to bridge misunderstandings between the 
communities of Norwalk and La Mirada. For years, disenchanted parents have 
claimed that schools in the other city were getting a larger share of district 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences between the communities have contributed to this sense of 
separateness. 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1990 Census figures, La Mirada, a city of 44,000, is about 
two-thirds white and Norwalk, with 94,000 residents, about two-thirds minority. 
In 1990, 82.4% of the residents of La Mirada owned their homes, compared to 65% 
in Norwalk. The median annual income for La Mirada residents was $47,123, 
compared to $38,124 in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences also are obvious at the four elementary schools participating in 
the desegregation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmondson, one of the Norwalk schools, is 98% Latino. About 85% of the 
students belong to impoverished families and qualify for subsidized school 
lunches. About 69% speak limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulles, in La Mirada, is 63% white, though it has a growing Latino minority. 
About 19% of the students qualify for subsidized school lunches. About 9% speak 
limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightly packed streets around Sanchez Elementary in Norwalk are lined 
mostly with simple, two- and three-bedroom wood or stucco single-family homes 
that date mainly from a post-World War II construction boom. The residents are 
largely a mix of recent Latino immigrants and Latino families who have lived in 
the area for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, district officials floated the idea of voluntary busing to 
achieve integration in both communities. But in a series of meetings with 
school officials, parents in both cities expressed little enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Families in the tight-knit Norwalk neighborhood did not want to send their 
children to school outside the area. The idea of busing received a similarly 
lukewarm reception in La Mirada, a quiet bedroom community that is home to 
numerous retirees and young professionals. The city is a mix of older 
middle-class neighborhoods interspersed among new tract developments. To some 
La Mirada families, Norwalk was a virtual barrio, plagued by gangs and crime. 
They did not move to La Mirada to send their children to schools in Norwalk, 
some said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district ditched the busing plan and began to look for alternatives. The 
current program was the brainchild of former district Assistant Superintendent 
Marie Plakos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like with the technology available in this day and age, there would 
be an avenue available to bring kids together to get to know each other and 
work on common projects," said Plakos, now an administrator in the Savanna 
Elementary School District in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 After the school board in 1992 unanimously approved a desegregation plan that 
described several potential integration strategies, administrators quickly set 
to work on the technological approach. They applied for funding to the state, 
which spends about $81 million a year on voluntary desegregation programs in 47 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In other districts, the money typically pays for more traditional forms of 
desegregation, including voluntary busing and magnet schools -- which are 
schools with special programs designed to lure white students to minority 
neighborhoods and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwalk-La Mirada program does not fit neatly into any category of 
integration that the state Education Code lists as eligible for state funding. 
For its funding application, the district calls the four participating schools 
"magnet centers." In a magnet school, however, students of different 
ethnicities are desegregated by actually attending the same school, said state 
and local school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Program director Contreras said Norwalk-La Mirada was not trying to deceive 
the state by classifying its program under the heading "magnet centers." The 
problem was that the innovative program didn't fit an existing funding 
category, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program received high marks from a private auditing firm that examined it 
under the auspices of the state controller's office, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors checked to see that all the money was properly accounted for and 
it was, said Edd Fong, spokesman for the controller's office. The auditors, 
however, did not evaluate whether the program achieved true desegregation or 
how well it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong emphasized that the office does not have the expertise to determine the 
educational value of programs. "That's why you have a Department of Education," 
he said. "I've heard our people say that the presumption is that a program is 
valid unless we hear otherwise from the Department of Education." 
</P>
<P>
 But the education department is required to do nothing other than receive 
desegregation plans, and has no role in approving or rejecting them, said 
Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials simply added Norwalk-La Mirada's program to the package of 
desegregation plans approved by the Legislature. The Norwalk-La Mirada program 
has received about $1.4 million each of the last two years. The first year's 
money covered start-up costs. The video transmissions began last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Using this money and any other available funds, the district ultimately hopes 
to link all district classes by video and computer, said program director 
Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
 To use state desegregation money for video and computer technology is 
inappropriate, said law professor Kushner, who teaches at Southwestern 
University School of Law in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rather unfortunate that the funds are being diverted, through a 
well-meaning program, to something that is not desegregation," Kushner said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some local school administrators credit Norwalk-La Mirada for discovering an 
ingenious method to get state funding for technology by calling it 
desegregation. Other school systems also want this technology, they said, but 
can't afford it during tight budget times when school districts everywhere are 
cutting programs and laying off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 With its desegregation funds, the Norwalk-La Mirada district has been able to 
purchase an array of equipment besides the two-way video system. Each 
participating classroom has two computers that can read compact discs, a 
variety of educational software, a color printer and a laser disc player. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four schools has three machines, similar to overhead projectors, 
that transmit video pictures of documents to other schools. Every campus also 
has a Xerox LiveBoard, which has a color monitor the size of a big-screen TV. 
Students can write directly on the monitor with an infrared pen and the text 
will appear at the school on the other end of the transmission, Contreras said.

 Several current and former administrators outside the district praised 
Norwalk-La Mirada for finding a way, through desegregation funding, to help all 
its students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can find ways to legally bring in money from new or existing sources, 
bless you, because that's the only way you can offer special opportunities to 
youngsters," said retired school superintendent Stanley G. Oswalt. Schools

<P>
 The annual Southern California Cajun & Zydeco Festival in Long Beach and the 
Troubadours of Music & Crafts Festival will not clash on June 4-5 after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubadours fest promoter Jim Rissmiller said the event has been postponed, 
probably until late August, because of rising costs and the loss of the event's 
airline sponsor. He said the festival will not take place in UCLA's Drake 
Stadium as announced, but at a location to be determined.

 The Cajun & Zydeco Festival will go on as planned June 4 and 5 at Long Beach's

 The Long Beach City College softball team etched itself into the record books 
in the state community college softball championships in Visalia. The Vikings, 
however, lost their bid for the title, losing to host College of the Sequoias, 
2-1, in the final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach lost to Sacramento, 8-7, in 26 innings in the opening game of the 
eight-team double-elimination tournament, breaking the state tournament record 
of 22 innings for longest game. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 41 hits, 24 by Sacramento, and 18 errors. Long Beach 
rallied from a 7-4 deficit to tie the score in the fourth and neither team 
scored until Sacramento pushed over the game-winner from third on an infield 
grounder in the top of the 26th. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (44-7) won five games in a row to advance to the championship. The 
Vikings defeated Mt. San Antonio, Palomar and Cypress on Saturday. Long Beach 
held on for a 3-2 victory over Sacramento in 10 innings and a 2-1 victory over 
Sequoias on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Lisa Balbirnie and outfielder Chris Benyak of Long Beach were 
all-state selections. Balbirnie (28-1), the South Coast most valuable pitcher, 
recorded three victories in the tournament, including a four-hitter against 
Cypress. PHOTO FINISH 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach City College men's track team won its 11th state title in 16 
years with Ron Allice as coach Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings needed some heroics in the final event, the 1,600-meter relay, to 
earn a tie with Riverside with 100 points for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Williams ran a 45.9-second anchor leg to move Long Beach from second to 
third in the final 25 meters as the Vikings timed a school-record 3 minutes, 
6.81 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside, which had defeated Long Beach in the 1,600 relay in the Southern 
California championships, entered the event holding a 96-92 lead but finished 
fourth. Sacramento won the event with a meet-record 3:06.03. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (championship) wasn't easy and we had to battle to tie it," Allice said. 
"I'm as elated with a tie as with any of the other titles. My enthusiasm hasn't 
diminished." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Jordan, who won the long jump with a leap of 24-0 3/4, and Barry 
Massey led a one-two Long Beach sweep in the triple jump, bounding 52-0 and 
50-8 1/4, respectively. Frank Guialdo also won the 110 high hurdles in 14.18 
for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Carrigan, the 1992 state 100 and 200-meter champion for Compton College 
who now attends Merritt, won the 100 and 200 in 10.27 and 20.72 to become the 
first athlete to win the events in two state meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdalena Lewy, Karen Vigilant, Tammera McLin and Angel Carver won individual 
titles to lead the Long Beach women to second in the team competition with 95 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewy, a sophomore from Lakewood High, won the 1,500 in 4:41.89 and was also 
second in the 5,000 in 17:27.10 and third in the 3,000 (10:14.77). 
</P>
<P>
 Vigilant won the 400 hurdles in 1:02.37 and joined McLin, winner of the 400 in 
54.37, LaShawn Stringer and Alisha Lopez on the Vikings' 1,600-meter relay team 
that placed second in 3:44.83. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver leaped 41-6 to win the triple jump and finished fourth in the long jump 
at 19-1. INVITATION ONLY 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team, bidding for its fourth College World 
Series appearance in six years, will play Washington (42-16) Friday in the 
Midwest II Regional at Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Long Beach (39-17), which shared the Big West title with Nevada 
and Cal State Fullerton, earned an at-large berth to the 48-team 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Midwest II regional, which includes top-seeded Georgia Tech, 
Wichita State, West Coast Conference champion Santa Clara and Connecticut, will 
advance to the College World Series in Omaha. REPEAT PERFORMER 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Poly girls' track team won its third consecutive Southern 
Section title and sophomore Michael Granville of Bell Gardens won his second 
individual title in the divisional finals Saturday at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Aminah Haddad won the 100 meters in 11.81 and the 200 meters in a Southern 
Section Division I record 23.23, a time that makes Haddad the 12th fastest in 
high school at that event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits amassed 82 points to run away from runner-up Muir (66) and 
Long Beach Wilson (58). 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Simpson won the 400 in 56.65 and the long jump with a wind-aided leap of 
20-1 1/2, and joined Aisha Washington and Myesha Williams on the Jackrabbits' 
victorious 1,600-meter relay (3:45.39). 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, who won the 400 meters as a freshman, won the 800 meters in 1:48.98 
on Saturday, smashing the national sophomore record of 1:50.8 shared by William 
Contee of Washington, D.C., and Fred Bronner of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern Section Division I record, Granville's time would have been fast 
enough to win at the Pacific 10 Conference by almost a second and the state 
community college meet by nearly two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 LaKeisha Backus of Wilson rebounded from a false start in the 100 to finish 
second in the 200 in 23.42 and anchor the Bruins' 400-meter relay team of 
Michelle Nelson, Mary Davis and Kinshasa Davis to first in 46.49. NAMES IN THE

PEOPLE: ARTS MAGAZINE IS SUCCESS STORY FOR JORDAN HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miracles do happen, English teacher Marie Tollstrup believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look at Jordan High School in Long Beach, where nearly a third of the 
students live in poverty and test scores are among the lowest in the district. 
Despite the odds, Jordan has achieved national acclaim in literary circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipient of this recognition is Stylus, a glossy student-produced arts 
magazine that is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollstrup, the magazine's adviser and founder, has watched Stylus grow into a 
well-designed, well-written 48-page glossy book filled with essays, short 
stories, photographs, art and poems. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Stylus has won dozens of awards, including one of the most 
prestigious in high school publications, the 1993 Highest Award from the 
National Council of Teachers of English. The award goes to the top 1% of the 
nearly 900 competing U.S. high school literary and art magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tollstrup's classroom earlier this year, seniors Brian Asis and Sarah 
Gutknecht hunched over drawings they were perfecting for publication in Stylus 
'94. Awards and plaques decorate the bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Before meeting Tollstrup, Sarah said, she was afraid to show people her work. 
"But (Tollstrup) encouraged me and made me feel good about my work. She does 
that for everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollstrup admitted, however, that she became involved in the literary effort 
almost by accident. "The creative writing class needed a teacher and no one 
wanted to teach it, so I thought I'd try it," she said. Later, she created 
Stylus as an outlet for her students' work. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine carries no advertising. Donors provide Tollstrup with the $5,000 
she needs to publish. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the motivator; she's so dedicated," said Dick Van Der Laan, spokesman 
for the Long Beach school district. "She probably will shoot me for saying 
this," he said, lowering his voice to a whisper, "but she's a former nun." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollstrup, 57, in fact makes no secret of her former life in the convent or of 
her love of the magazine and the students who put it out. "I went to the 
convent to save souls," she said. "And then I realized I could save as many 
being a lay person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let students know they can write. I tell them I think they can be 
successful if they try. And they stick with me because I believe in them. I 
believe everyone can learn to be a better writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollstrup grew up on a farm in rural Wisconsin. At 14, she entered a convent 
school with the intention of joining a teaching order. After teaching in high 
schools in affluent as well as poor sections of Chicago, she left the convent 
in 1968 and moved west to be closer to her family. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the Jordan staff 26 years ago. "There have been huge, vast 
changes," she said. The school enrollment, which was predominantly white then, 
is now 34% Latino, 31% black, 10% Asian and 17% white. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's diverse student population is precisely what makes the literary 
magazine so successful, officials said.

SAFETY: FUNDING FOR CROSSING GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to make you aware of a serious situation that will directly affect 
everyone who drives in the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, state legislators dropped the mandate that required cities and 
counties to fund school crossing guards.The Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors plans to cut funding of the guards 50% this year and not fund the 
program at all next year. 
</P>
<P>
 This means thousands of school children 5 to 12 years of age will be left 
unprotected. Picture in your mind a kindergarten child -- age 5 -- trying to 
cross a busy street. How long before you, a friend or a family member 
accidentally hits, injures or kills a child in a school crosswalk because there 
was no crossing guard? 
</P>
<P>
 As the mother of a child killed in a crosswalk, I will not sit idly by and let 
this happen to another family or community. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot let the county put children at the mercy of 5 million automobiles 
and trucks that travel our streets daily. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly urge everyone to contact the county supervisors and let them know 
we will not tolerate any action that puts children in danger.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, contact your local school board and get involved in one of two 
petitions. One petition asks the Board of Supervisors to fund crossing guards. 
The other asks the state to reinstate regulations requiring cities and counties 
to pay for crossing guards. I realize the supervisors are trying to balance 
their budget, but they must be sensitive and act responsibly for the safety of 
our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not let the supervisors balance their budget by gambling with our 
children's lives.

LOW AIR FARES WINGING TO O.C. ON SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new era of lower air fares lands today at Orange County's John Wayne Airport 
as price-cutter Southwest Airlines starts service with 15 round-trip daily 
flights to the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's arrival is welcome at John Wayne, dogged for years with the 
reputation of being a convenient but expensive alternative for air travelers. 
Southwest, with eight flights to San Jose and seven to Oakland, has a $69 
one-way fare to any California destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County typically has higher average fares than Los Angeles . . . and 
there are signs that now is changing," said Dave Messing, a spokesman for 
Continental Airlines, which has a low-cost subsidiary operating in the East and 
has started discounting some flights from John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Major competitors Alaska Airlines and American Airlines will match Southwest's 
fares starting today on their flights to Oakland and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers say they are delighted by the lower fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's neat. I have been waiting a long time for Southwest," said 
Charles Goldenberg, a management consultant for the accounting firm KMPG Peat 
Marwick. "I don't like the commuter flights because they are small and 
cramped." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cary, a vice president of Quantum Health Group in Orange, was booked on a 
commuter airline flight to Oakland and pulled his ticket from his pocket to 
show he was paying $121.82 to be bounced around for a 1-hour, 40-minute flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interminable amount of time in a small plane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Restrictions aimed at reducing local noise levels have limited the number of 
flights and kinds of planes that operate from Orange County, which has reduced 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southern California airports, meanwhile, have seen rapid increases in 
passenger counts and revenues with the entry of Southwest, Reno Air and other 
short-haul, discount carriers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Southwest has sparked a local fare war as rival carriers plan to 
either match its prices or withdraw flights from its initial two destinations. 
Within a year, Orange County passengers could see lower fares to other routes 
as major airlines create low-cost subsidiaries to head off Southwest before it 
expands further. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike its competitors, Southwest Airlines has grown at a wild pace and has 
been the only consistent moneymaker in a sky full of losing carriers. Its 
secret: no-frills service, flying only Boeing 737s and reloading planes within 
minutes of arrival so they spend their time earning revenue aloft rather than 
sitting idly on the ground. Those measures, plus a reputation for quality, keep 
fares low and customers happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ft. Worth-based airline is growing so fast that John Wayne officials say 
Southwest has asked to grab any open slot it can get for new service. So far, 
though, none is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with its unrestricted, everyday, one-way price of $69, Southwest offers 
advance purchase discounts that cut the price as low as $49 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines, Southwest's prime competitor to San Jose, plans to cut its 
nine daily weekday flights to six starting June 17, and the service could 
eventually disappear altogether, according to spokesman John Hotard. Those 
flights will be replaced with destinations where Southwest doesn't fly from 
Orange County, such as Palm Springs and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot compete with low-cost carriers such as Southwest, so we have to see 
what our viable options are," Hotard said. "In the meantime, we will be 
competitive" by offering the same $69 fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's no-frills service could be a letdown for "a guy like me who 
travels a lot and gets first-class upgrades," said John Schofield, a Western 
Digital Corp. salesman who was lined up for an American Airlines flight Tuesday 
night to San Jose. "But outside of that, it's just a plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Schofield, who flies from San Jose twice a week, said his company plans to 
switch much of its travel to Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Other airlines are responding to a potential Southwest challenge of entry onto 
their routes. Continental Airlines, for example, has initiated its own 
no-frills, $198 round-trip "Peanuts Fares" from Orange County to Denver. Like 
Southwest, Continental will offer a two-for-one discount for advance purchasers 
on the route that would mean each traveler could fly for $99 round-trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier has also created a CALite subsidiary along the Eastern seaboard, a 
low-cost carrier aimed at matching Southwest before it gets started there. So 
far, Southwest has limited penetration in the East, serving Baltimore and a few 
airports in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines, which operates 17 flights daily from John Wayne, is expected 
to start a companion low-cost carrier dubbed U2 if its $4.9-billion employee 
buyout goes through. "The goal is to get operating costs close to those of 
Southwest," said spokesman Joe Hopkins. He added that John Wayne could be a 
candidate for short-haul service, to destinations less than 750 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commuter airlines are being especially hard hit by the arrival of 
Southwest and are reducing service. For instance, Westair Commuter Airlines 
Inc., which operates as United Express on flights to Los Angeles International 
Airport and Fresno, dropped its service to Oakland on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of discount fares may come slowly at John Wayne. Southwest was only 
able to receive approval to operate after it bought Morris Air Service, which 
had two daily flights from Orange County to Salt Lake City, which are being 
continued under Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air, another discount carrier, has expressed interest in beginning 
service at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as noise requirements have limited flights, they have also limited 
competition -- and led to higher fares, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a limit on the number of flight operations, it creates a 
disincentive for discounting," said David Stempler, executive director for the 
International Airline Passengers Assn. in Washington, a 110,000-member lobbying 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But change will come, he said. The nation's airlines system will essentially 
become two-tiered. Short-distance flights will all become no-frills, 
deep-discount affairs akin to a commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-haul flights will continue to offer full meal service, baggage 
connections and other amenities, like Amtrak.
