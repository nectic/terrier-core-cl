 PSYCHO THRILLER: Three decades ago his book "Psycho" became a blood-tingling 
movie, making his twisted killer, Norman Bates, a household name. Author Robert 
Bloch had planned to spend Halloween in Ventura, signing copies of the 35th 
anniversary edition of the book. . . . Sadly, Bloch died in September. But the 
Phantom Bookshop on Main Street is planning a "posthumous book signing" this 
afternoon to sell 75 copies he autographed before his death.

 NO SUGAR TONIGHT: Trick-or-treating can be tough if you can't eat sweets. 
That's why Ventura County Medical Center sponsored a camp for diabetic children 
this weekend, handing out sugarless treats, fruit and other suitable snacks. . 
. . The youngsters also competed in a costume contest and mummy wrap. . . . 
Diabetes strikes more than 50,000 people in Ventura County, hitting Latinos 
particularly hard. Local eye doctors have banded together to give free exams 
for diabetics, who risk blindness if untreated. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY TREE: As if the Civic Arts Plaza wasn't enough to put Thousand Oaks on 
the map, the city has installed the first of several signs designed to let 
motorists know they've arrived. . . . The four-foot, concrete-and-brass sign on 
Olsen Road marks the border with Simi Valley. Denise Filz, who designed the 
gateway-to-the-city markers, calls the textured oak tree "something truly 
unique, with a natural feeling." Critics call it expensive, at $5,000 a sign. 
</P>
<P>
 FINAL SALUTE: It lost its county funding two years ago. Now the Ventura County 
Commission for Women could be losing its annual awards contest. . . . After 
receiving only 17 nominees for all 12 Salute to Women categories, commission 
members decided to cancel this fall's banquet. They'll give one final round of 
awards next spring, then retire the contest after 12 years. "It's kind of sad, 
isn't it?" commissioner Loma Siegel said, adding that other groups have picked 
up the slack in recognizing women's achievements.

STATE CONTROLLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There you go again. The Times had outdone itself. In endorsing Kathleen 
Connell for state controller (Oct. 19), The Times has proven once again that it 
will always endorse big-government liberals -- much to taxpayers' 
chagrin.Connell established an impressive record of wasting taxpayers' money 
when she bankrupted Los Angeles' homeowners' maintenance effort to the tune of 
almost $9 million. Now, Connell thinks this failure qualifies her to be 
controller -- which is the constitutionally designated taxpayers' watchdog.  
</P>
<P>
 The Times has blown a perfect opportunity to endorse Tom McClintock, who has 
earned a ballot designation of "taxpayers' advocate." McClintock is just the 
remedy for the bloated state budget. He has promised to use the controller's 
constitutionally mandated authority to cut waste at all levels of state 
government. McClintock will put control back into the controller's office.

 Re "Stinginess Proves Too Much for Candidate McClintock's 'Skinflint' Ads," 
Oct. 20: No, they don't pretend to be heavy on issues, but McClintock's radio 
ads are delightful little gems of good humor and good taste -- well, good 
humor, anyway. And in a year of political filth, that's enough to earn my 
gratitude and my vote.

ENDORSEMENTS IN SEVEN RACES FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times does not endorse in all races for the state Legislature but rather 
supports candidates selectively, on a case-by-case basis. On the Nov. 8 ballot 
we endorse in the following races: 
</P>
<P>
 42nd Assembly District. This is one of the most heavily Democratic districts 
in the state, covering West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, West Los Angeles and 
southern parts of the San Fernando Valley. The Democratic candidate, Wally 
Knox, is a veteran labor lawyer and elected member of the Los Angeles Community 
College District who won a hotly contested primary on a law-and-order platform. 
Still, he believes the "three-strikes" law should be amended to focus better on 
truly violent offenders, and he opposes the immigration initiative. He's right 
about both. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent is Bob Davis, a West Hollywood swimming pool contractor who calls 
himself a libertarian Republican who believes in "limited decentralized 
government." His philosophical consistency on the issues is appealing, even if 
he is politically out of sync with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 We endorse Knox. We are concerned, however, about how independent he would be 
in Sacramento, having raised more than $600,000 in campaign funds from among 
his many contacts in organized labor. That notwithstanding, Knox is better 
qualified and more reflective of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 43rd Assembly District. This district includes Glendale, Burbank, Hollywood 
and Los Feliz. For the last five months it has been represented by Republican 
James Rogan, who won a special election to fill Pat Nolan's unexpired term 
following Nolan's guilty plea in a corruption case. The Democratic challenger 
is Adam Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both men have similar professional backgrounds in criminal justice, 
the usual hoary game of upmanship on crime is not being played. Rogan was a 
prosecutor and a Glendale Municipal Court judge; Schiff was an assistant U.S. 
attorney in Los Angeles. Both are thoughtful and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideologically, however, they contrast. Rogan is a conservative who opposes 
virtually all forms of gun control. He supports Proposition 187 and, on the 
basis of one evening spent with the Border Patrol, has made inflammatory 
statements about the motivations of Mexican immigrants. Schiff is a moderate 
who wants to revisit the state tax structure so the burden is distributed more 
evenly. We endorse Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly District 44. This district runs through La Canada-Flintridge, 
Pasadena, South Pasadena, Sunland, Tujunga, San Marino and Altadena. The knock 
on incumbent Republican Bill Hoge is that he has become the puppet of horse 
racing and gambling interests. He has raised $140,000 from horse owners, racing 
associations, card clubs and a major Las Vegas casino. Hoge sits on the 
Assembly Governmental Organization Committee, which considers all gambling 
bills in the Assembly, and tried to push through the Assembly no fewer than 
eight bills that would have benefited the gambling and horse racing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic challenger, Bruce Philpott, is a former police chief of 
Pasadena who is widely credited with bringing community-oriented policing to 
that city. As a law enforcement professional, he has specific ideas on 
improving the state's controversial "three-strikes" law that should be heard in 
Sacramento. We endorse Philpott.  
</P>
<P>
 53rd Assembly District. Debra Bowen is the incumbent in this district, which 
stretches from Venice south through Marina del Rey, El Segundo and Torrance. 
She has sponsored campaign-reform legislation (which, alas, died), and this 
issue will remain a priority for her if she is reelected. Bowen has a 
reputation as a legislator who stood up to the Democratic leaders in Sacramento 
when she disagreed with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Sirull is Bowen's Republican opponent. He is a political newcomer with 
a background in business administration, specifically accounting and insurance. 
He has some good ideas on making California's regulatory environment friendlier 
to business. But he hasn't made a case for replacing Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
 69th State Assembly District. This district covers Anaheim and Santa Ana. Mike 
Metzler, a Democrat who is president of the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, is a 
reasonable and moderate candidate, thoroughly knowledgeable on the issues of 
jobs, education and housing. He is our preference over Jim Morrissey, his 
Republican opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 70th State Assembly District. Marilyn C. Brewer, a Republican, has the insight 
and experience as a businesswoman and a staff assistant to Supervisor Tom Riley 
to merit the seat over Democratic opponent Jim Toledano in this district, which 
covers Newport Beach, Irvine and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 36th State Senate District. This suburban district covers western Riverside 
County and northern San Diego County. Although heavily Republican in 
registration it has been represented for the last several years by a Democrat, 
Robert Presley, widely admired as one of the most effective legislators in 
Sacramento. Presley must retire due to term-limits laws and has endorsed 
Riverside County Supervisor Kay Ceniceros, a Democrat. She has a solid record 
in local government and can take credit for such noteworthy achievements as 
bringing Metrolink commuter rail trains to Riverside County. Her Republican 
opponent, Ray Haynes, is regarded even by many Republicans in the district as 
too rigidly right-wing. We endorse Ceniceros.

REDOING SCIENCE POLICY; CLINTON QUIETLY SEEKS A NEW RATIONALE IN A KEY MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been largely lost in the hubbub over Haiti and other headline-grabbing 
issues, but the Clinton Administration has been quietly trying to bring a new 
rationale to American science policy. Probably no administration since 
President John F. Kennedy's has taken such a strong interest in harnessing 
science and technology to promote national interests and economic 
competitiveness. But President Clinton has also put top priority on deficit 
reduction, making it hard to match lofty rhetoric about "vigorous exploration" 
of scientific frontiers with the dollars to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than half a century, U.S. science was driven largely by the 
imperatives of World War II and the ensuing Cold War. That made science fat and 
prosperous, but also distorted it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration deserves credit for recognizing that. In its first 
formal science statement, "Science in the National Interest," Clinton and Vice 
President Al Gore stressed the connections between basic research and 
industrial technology. They called for a refocusing of the $73-billion federal 
research budget toward health, transportation, the information "superhighway," 
clean vehicles, global environmental protection and other civilian concerns. 
And they called for increasing American public and private investment in 
research and development from 2.6% to 3% of gross domestic product, matching 
Japan's. 
</P>
<P>
 All worthy goals, but not easily achieved in this fiscal climate. The budget 
just passed by Congress represents a zero-sum game for science. Some agencies, 
primarily the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), got big boosts. But that means tough times for 
scientists supported by NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the Defense 
and Energy departments and other agencies. And there has still not been much 
progress toward the Administration's goal of shifting the balance of federal 
support so that defense and civilian research and development are funded at 
about equal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly interesting is the NIST, a Commerce Department agency that is 
Clinton's main vehicle to provide high-risk research support to promising new 
industries. This raises the controversial question of whether the government 
means to set industrial policy for the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Given fiscal constraints, a key question is whether Washington can get more 
bang for the science dollar. To that end, Clinton has created the National 
Science and Technology Council, an interagency panel meant, in bureaucratic 
jargon, to "crosscut" the science budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In English, that means to reduce redundancies among agencies. Efforts are 
being made also to save money by inviting international cooperation on major 
science projects like the space station. The council has seldom met, and it 
remains to be seen whether it can do much. History suggests such ambitious 
agendas falter on the bureaucratic inertia of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton wins high marks for quality appointments, including John H. Gibbons as 
presidential science adviser, the Nobelist Harold A. Varmus as director at NIH, 
Neal F. Lane as NSF director and John M. Deutch, former provost at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as deputy secretary of defense. And 
Clinton's advisers have tackled the scientific disorder at NASA and the need to 
find a new purpose for the national laboratories run by the Defense and Energy 
departments now that weapons development is a lower priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century ago, a prominent physicist and statesman of science, Vannevar 
Bush, issued a seminal report, "Science: The Endless Frontier." That document 
established firmly that the federal government had a special responsibility to 
support basic research. That investment gave the United States world 
preeminence in science and medicine, not to mention military might. But the 
time has come to devise a new science policy that recognizes a new world 
reality forced both by the dramatic political changes of the last dozen years 
and by new communications and other technologies. The Administration has made a 
start.

JUDGE LANCE ITO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Lance Ito is upset about a media gone wild and at the same time he 
releases "secret" transcriptions of a closed-door meeting that he had to know 
would stir up the media some more (Oct. 22).

 What?! Prosecutor Marcia Clark wishes prospective jurors could be given a lie

<P>
 With regard to Simpson's trial, has either side seriously considered the 
option of waiving a jury, and letting a judge try the case; either Judge Ito or 
another, acceptable to both sides? Two complementary interests need be served 
-- a fair trial for the defendant, and justice for society.  
</P>
<P>
 With a court trial (no jury) the media crush should diminish, the problems 
associated with jury selection would vanish, the duration of the trial 
shortened, and Simpson might have a little money left for his family.  
</P>
<P>
 With the death penalty no longer an issue, Simpson might well be better off in 
the hands of a single individual considered to be knowledgeable, intelligent 
and fair, rather than rolling the dice with a dozen strangers, many of whom are 
likely to have their own agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 If the defense waived a jury, you can bet your last nickel the prosecution 
wouldn't insist on one, and in the end we'd all be better served.

KEMP, BENNETT OPPOSE PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp are so concerned about Proposition 187, rather 
than waste everyone's time with a media-spin position statement (Oct. 19), I 
suggest they draft an initiative -- or better yet, a federal law -- that solves 
the illegal immigration problem the "right" way. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree 187 is a Draconian measure that is bad law. Unfortunately, it is the 
only club I see within reach to get Washington's attention when I enter the 
polling booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's have more "real-world" solutions from 187 opponents and less posturing. 
When I see a better solution on the ballot, I'll be happy to vote for it.  
</P>

 I was at the Jack Kemp lecture at the Nixon Library ("Kemp Defends Criticism 
Before Hostile Audience," Oct. 20). If you call standing ovations and lots of 
clapping "an unenthusiastic and sometimes angry audience," then I don't really 
understand "unenthusiastic and angry." Kemp was very well received. So he is 
opposed to Proposition 187 because it is a poorly written bill. I can 
understand that and so did others in the audience. We all realize it's a poorly 
written bill, but it's a start. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 I applaud Kemp's personal stand on 187. Instead of criticizing Kemp for 
voicing his position, Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) should appreciate the opinion of such a respected 
politician. Contrary to what Rohrabacher claims is an "act of stupidity (that) 
has knocked him right out of the presidential race," I have more respect for 
Kemp now as a politician with a conscience and good sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Party has long been absent in compassion for minorities, which 
Pete Wilson, Rohrabacher and Dornan continue to prove. For the first time in 
over 20 years, I intend to cross over party lines to vote against Wilson and 
any other Republican who supports Proposition 187. It's encouraging to know if 
Kemp does run for President, I can find a reason to vote Republican. The 
California Republicans with all their smoke screens sure can't give me one.

 I understand if Proposition 187 passes, teachers will be told to report 
students they "suspect" are illegal residents. I'd like to know who teachers 
are supposed to report to? 
</P>
<P>
 While Harold Ezell was director of the Western Region, the INS was already so 
overwhelmed with paperwork that the agency shut down its mechanism for 
obtaining information from schools and simply ignored visa students who left 
school to become "illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Do Ezell and other proponents of Proposition 187 think the INS is now prepared 
to hire thousands of employees to handle their new paperwork, or are teachers 
supposed to report illegal students to each other during their lunch breaks? 
Since the police already have their hands full, what will be their role in this 
scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 Will a supporter of Proposition 187 please tell me how this law is supposed to 
work?

HALLOWEEN ORIGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to assure Elaine E. Minamide ("Bedeviled by Halloween," Voices, 
Oct. 17) that she needn't worry about Druids. What little we know about them we 
get from Julius Caesar and other classical writers, and a bit more from early 
medieval Irish sources. None of them speak about sinister rites on Oct. 31, the 
end of the Celtic year. A plausible case has been made that All Saints' Day was 
set on Nov. 1 in Eighth Century Ireland, to coincide with the beginning of the 
new year (see John Hennig, "The Meaning of All the Saints," Medieval Studies 
10, 1948, 147-61), but there is no evidence to indicate that it was meant to 
offset remnants of superstitious high jinks or low jinks that took place on the 
previous day or evening. The commemoration of the faithful departed on Nov. 2 
(All Souls' Day) was a later Continental development, though perhaps it was 
partially inspired by an Irish commemoration on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 So when did the idea of spooky Halloweens arise? Rather late, I'm afraid, at 
least in the English-speaking world. The first relevant record I can find in 
Great Britain is a poem called "Halloween," by John Mayne, which appeared in a 
Scottish magazine in 1780. It doubtless inspired the similar poem of the same 
name published by Robert Burns in 1786. Burns added explanatory notes "for the 
sake of those who are unacquainted with the manners and traditions of the 
country where the scene is cast," that is, among the peasantry in the west of 
Scotland. He explains, as if it would be unfamiliar to most of his readers, 
that Halloween "is thought to be a night when witches, devils, and other 
mischief-making beings are all abroad on their baneful midnight errands; 
particularly, those aerial people, the fairies, are said, on that night, to 
hold a grand anniversary." But in the poem itself, he only mentions fairies 
dancing, and he only describes various fortune-telling rituals performed by a 
group of courting couples, like pulling up a cabbage to see what one's future 
spouse will be like. He makes it sound like great fun. 
</P>
<P>
 It is entirely possible, of course, that some of the rural Scottish beliefs in 
Burns' time concerning the evening before All Saints' Day were leftovers from 
pre-Christian times, but, if so, they must have been pretty diluted and should 
have given little cause for religious concern. I am still looking for hard 
evidence of earlier Halloween celebrations, and I would be grateful for any 
light that readers can throw on the subject. Meanwhile, I urge everyone to go 
with the flow and enjoy the festival as it has developed in our culture.

 As I followed the national debate on health care, I could not help but 
remember the hundreds of tragedies I've come across since I have been a 
physician: lack of access to proper care, financial ruin despite thousands 
spent on health premiums, insurance companies that want to insure the healthy 
and desert the sick and who see patients as objects to manipulate to maximize 
profits, lack of peace of mind regarding our most precious commodity, our 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a chaotic health insurance non-system that dictates everything, 
guarantees nothing and purposefully sacrifices people's health, financial 
security and peace of mind for financial gain. And now the beneficiaries of 
this chaos are using every means possible to dissuade the public from passing 
Proposition 186, the California Health Security Act.  
</P>
<P>
 I have seen and lived what this proposition entails. I studied medicine at 
McGill University in Montreal where I experienced the single-payer system 
firsthand. Like most of my American colleagues who trained in Canada, I 
enthusiastically support single-payer universal coverage. As a physician, I may 
have been called a heretic just a few years ago for promoting single-payer 
health care. But the insurance companies and "mis"managed-care firms have 
abused us and our patients. They have micromanaged our patient care and 
violated the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship. They have forced our 
large academic centers to compromise their educational and research missions in 
order to compete with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, what was heresy has now gained legitimacy. In addition to the 
1,000 physicians of the California Physicians Alliance who crafted the 
California Health Security Act, the California Medical Assn. admits that more 
than 10,000 of its members favor a single-payer system. This trend among 
physicians is being progressively censored and suppressed by many hospital 
administrators who thrive on the current massive inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186's single-payer plan is a publicly financed, privately 
delivered, competitive health-care system that would provide legal California 
residents with a card enabling them to see the physician of their choice. The 
public would elect a health commissioner to administer the system, someone who 
is accountable to us and not to stockholders. The commissioner would be advised 
by a board of physicians and medical experts and would answer to consumer 
councils throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The health security act was carefully written and worded by physicians to 
preclude any micromanagement or intervention in the physician-patient 
relationship. The excellent benefits package would be available to all from 
cradle to grave. It could not be taken away because of change in employment, 
disability, illness, divorce or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us would be very angry if the government we elected had to authorize 
our health care before we received it; yet we easily accept profit-motivated 
insurance companies doing just that. It is time to reduce the 15%-30% insurance 
overhead (and multimillion dollar CEO salaries) our health premiums finance and 
replace it with the 2%-4% overhead seen in Medicare and single-payer systems. 
The money is there. It is just being wasted, most recently on huge campaigns to 
defeat national health reform and false advertising to defeat Proposition 186. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters are starting to look past the propaganda and cliches, but two 
major concerns remain. The first is: "If I have good insurance now, what's in 
it for me?" My wife and I have excellent insurance. We pay no premiums, have 
some choice and low deductibles. But we still lack what we most long for: 
security. If I become disabled and lose my job and my ability to pay premiums, 
I lose it all. You may be terribly disappointed with even good insurance once 
you need it for a chronic disease, devastating illness or long-term care. The 
list of reasons for which people lose their health insurance is endless. 
</P>
<P>
 The second concern is cost; we don't want to pay more taxes. Most of us 
already pay heavy health-care taxes in the form of constantly rising premiums. 
In addition, we all pay for our care through deductibles and co-payments that 
can go into the thousands. The overwhelming majority of middle-income 
Californians will pay less in taxes than they are now paying for health 
coverage. The Congressional Budget Office, after reviewing all alternatives, 
concluded that single-payer is the only plan that would cover all Americans, 
reduce health expenditures and reduce the deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the major strategies of those who want to deny us our rights is to 
villainize our northern neighbor's health-care system. But poll after poll has 
shown the Canadian public and physicians to be very satisfied with their 
system. Canadians have universal coverage and total health security; 95% of all 
medical services in Canada are administered within 24 hours of need; Canadian 
medicine remains at the frontier of medical science, with developments of such 
innovative therapies as lung and bone marrow transplants, which are performed 
on a higher per-capita basis in Canada and denied to many Americans with "good" 
insurance under the pretext that they are "investigational therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 I studied medicine because I wanted to engage in the healing arts, not in 
business administration. Please vote "yes" on 186 to restore this privilege to 
me and thousands of my fellow physicians and to give yourself what you so truly 
deserve: your right to a doctor.

PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSITION 186; THIS IS THE WRONG PRESCRIPTION; A 
'SINGLE-PAYER' HEALTH-CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WON'T WORK; IT WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC 
AND MEDICAL DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD M. ROSENBERG, Richard M. Rosenberg is chairman and chief executive 
officer of Bank of America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As banker to millions of California residents and businesses and one of the 
state's largest employers, Bank of America believes it is important to ensure 
that high-quality health care is accessible to all Californians, that the 
spiraling costs of health care be contained and that a delivery mechanism be 
designed that will not stifle economic growth. Proposition 186, we believe, is 
not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has grappled with these issues and has so far been unable to resolve 
them. Now, Californians are faced with a ballot initiative, Proposition 186 -- 
the so-called single-payer proposal. Its supporters say Proposition 186 will 
make high-quality health care accessible to all without increasing costs. It is 
tempting to believe such a glowing scenario, especially after the 
disappointment over congressional inaction. Unfortunately, Proposition 186 
cannot work as its supporters envision. In fact, its passage would cause 
serious deterioration of the state's economy, ultimately leading to significant 
cutbacks in health care. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, Proposition 186 threatens to derail California's long-awaited 
economic recovery. At worst, it could virtually disable the state's health-care 
delivery system. As such, 186 violates the first tenet of the medical 
profession's Hippocratic Oath: Do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's proponents would have us believe that for the same number of 
health-care dollars Californians pay now, Proposition 186 would give us a 
greatly improved system, including universal coverage, long-term care, 
prescription drugs, mental, dental and eye care. As the saying goes, if it 
sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial facts tell us that Proposition 186 cannot deliver what it 
promises. Authors of the plan themselves estimate that a $40-billion tax 
increase will be needed to replace the private-insurance premiums individuals 
and employers now pay. This tax increase would be the largest ever imposed in 
any state. Much of it would come from new state income taxes -- a minimum of an 
additional 2 1/2% of an individual's total income. This may not seem like much, 
but the numbers add up quickly. For example, a family of four with a $32,000 
income, applying the standard deduction, would incur a 230% increase in its 
state income-tax bill -- from about $296 to about $976.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to new income taxes on individuals, California employers would be 
subject to a payroll tax increase of between 4.4% and 8.9%. In the state's 
current economic climate, few if any employers could afford to pay those new 
taxes without making offsetting adjustments elsewhere. Those adjustments would 
take the form of reduced pay rates, additional staff reductions or both. Many 
employers would be forced either to downsize or to move. An independent study 
commissioned by the state's nonpartisan Office of the Legislative Analyst 
predicts that nearly 300,000 California jobs would be lost by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 That study also demonstrates that even with a $40-billion annual tax increase 
and a tripling of the state's general fund, the single-payer plan would produce 
a state budget deficit of $48 billion by 1998. UC Berkeley's Graduate School of 
Public Policy and Health and Medical Sciences predicts funding shortages of 
$14.5 billion to $27.5 billion a year. This deficit would have to be made up by 
raising taxes further, reducing services or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The options available for dealing with these potentially immense financing 
shortfalls would be limited and wholly inadequate. Californians could not 
afford the kinds of tax increases that would be continuously necessary. The 
state's credit rating would be imperiled, dramatically increasing our cost of 
borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, unless the benefits offered under the health-care system were 
dramatically reduced, our economy would spiral downward. Not even a robust 
state economy could withstand such rapidly escalating financial burdens. And 
California's economy is far from robust. 
</P>
<P>
 No Californian can afford to take the risk that Proposition 186 will fall 
short of delivering on its promises. The single-payer system would dismantle 
the existing infrastructure of private health-insurance providers, and if it 
fails, California would be left with a gaping health-care delivery void. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as we might like to believe that a health-care utopia is within reach, 
unfortunately, it is not. Congress has just demonstrated the complexity of 
designing an affordable and workable health-care system. Such a task is too 
great, too important and too complicated to attempt via an all-or-nothing 
ballot initiative. Only a comprehensive and public legislative process can 
adequately address an issue of this economic and social magnitude.

A DISSENTING VOTE ON THE ENDORSEMENT OF PETE WILSON; ELECTION: THE GOVERNOR 
OFFENDED EVERY LATINO WHEN HE TIED HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN TO THE UGLY, BIGOTED 
PROP. 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK del OLMO, Frank del Olmo is deputy editor of the editorial pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times on Sunday published an editorial endorsing Gov. Pete Wilson for 
reelection, the first time this newspaper has endorsed a gubernatorial 
candidate in more than 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 As deputy editor of the editorial pages, I played a role in the deliberations 
that led up to its publication. Unfortunately, my deeply felt belief that 
Wilson does not deserve The Times' endorsement did not carry the day. Under 
normal circumstances, I would quietly accept that decision and move on. This 
time I cannot. Because this is not just another political campaign. And the 
Wilson endorsement is not -- as a senior colleague whom I respect tried to 
convince me -- just another endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, a Mexican American born and reared in California and a journalist here 
for more than 20 years, this campaign is unprecedented in the harm it does -- 
permanent damage, I fear -- to an ethnic community I care deeply about and a 
state I love. The reason, of course, is its weapon of choice: the complex and 
emotional issue of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the form of Proposition 187 -- the mean-spirited and unconstitutional 
ballot initiative that would deprive "apparent illegal aliens" of public health 
services and immigrant children of public education -- the immigration issue 
has become the cornerstone of Wilson's desperate and cynical effort to win a 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
 I say cynical because Wilson has chosen to discuss the immigration issue not 
on the high plane one would expect from the governor of the nation's largest 
state -- a man who could be President someday. Instead he has taken the low 
road, using alarmist rhetoric and frightening television ads that portray 
illegal immigrants in the ugliest, most negative terms. He is making illegal 
immigrants scapegoats for larger economic problems, like the defense cutbacks 
that so devastated the California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 So I must protest against this awful, and unnecessary, campaign in the 
strongest way I know how -- if only to live with my conscience after the voters 
render their judgment on both Wilson and Proposition 187 on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Please note how I link the two campaigns -- Wilson the candidate and 187 the 
ballot measure. That is pivotal to my reasoning and to the fundamental 
difference I now feel with some of my superiors. For I am speaking as a Mexican 
American, and in the eyes of the vast majority of Mexican Americans -- 
California's largest single ethnic group at 6.1 million people -- Wilson's 
campaign and the Proposition 187 cannot be separated. Lord knows, the Wilson 
campaign has made no effort to separate the two in the minds of anxious voters. 
</P>
<P>
 I say that with the confidence of someone who has covered Mexican American 
politics in this state for many years. And sources I trust have told me that 
the same can be said of this state's fastest-growing minority, the 2.8 million 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that my dissent may seem overstated to many reasonable people. But 
consider: As recently as a few weeks ago, opinion polls showed Proposition 187 
getting support even among a majority of Latino voters. That's because, as I 
have written often on these pages, Latinos are not all that different from 
voters of any other ethnic group. They worry about the economy and crime and 
other issues. And they will tell pollsters that they, too, wish that someone 
would "do something" about the problem of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 But that apparent consensus breaks down when you get to specifics, like asking 
Latinos whether distant relatives back home should be able to come to this 
country, legally or not. That's why, with the election season in the home 
stretch and Latinos starting to realize just how Proposition 187 would hurt 
their families, friends and neighbors, opinion has swung dramatically against 
the initiative. A Times poll published last week showed that support had 
dropped to only 22% among Latino registered voters -- a number that does not 
take into account the sentiment of all the Latinos who cannot vote because they 
are too young or are not citizens. Even right-wing Republicans like Ronald 
Reagan could count on at least 30% of the Latino vote. So it is clear that 
Latinos have turned overwhelmingly against 187, and are likely to also turn 
against Pete Wilson -- and not just on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 I have known and liked Wilson since he was mayor of San Diego. I don't think 
he's a bigot. But he made a terrible mistake in this campaign. By aligning 
himself with the immigration issue in its most nativist form, he has given 
legitimacy to an ugly streak of bigotry in California. And Latinos everywhere 
will never forgive him for that. 
</P>
<P>
 We can no more forget what Wilson has done in the 1994 campaign than African 
Americans can forget how segregationist governors like Arkansas' Orval Faubus 
tried to keep black children from getting a decent education in public schools, 
or than Jews can forget the Rev. Jesse Jackson's "Hymietown" remark in the 1984 
presidential campaign. And whatever else can be said about Jackson, he made the 
remark in public only once and has been trying to bury it ever since. Wilson, 
on the other hand, has been campaigning against illegal immigrants from Mexico 
for the better part of a year. Just imagine how Jews would feel if "Hymietown" 
had been the keystone of a yearlong campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are harsh comparisons, but they are not entirely mine. I know that many 
thousands, if not millions, of Mexican Americans and Mexican citizens feel the 
same way. Wilson's pro-187 campaign will stick in our craws for generations, 
the way "Hymietown" will probably always haunt Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why The Times' endorsement of Wilson is not just another endorsement, 
and why I must register my dissent so publicly. I want people out there to know 
-- especially the young Latinos and Asian Americans who will be the leaders of 
this state in the future, and, I hope, readers of this newspaper as well -- 
that not all of us here at The Times feel good about Pete Wilson. Many of us 
share your anger.

 Farmers Sue Over Apple Imports: A group of five Japanese growers demanded in a 
lawsuit that the Tokyo government withdraw its earlier decision to lift a ban 
on apple imports from the United States.The farmers allege that the government 
has not taken adequate precautions against the spread of fire blight, a disease 
affecting apples in the United States. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries decided in August to lift the ban after a bitter dispute over 
quarantine standards, which some claimed were a thinly disguised trade 
ban.After making inspections, Japan determined that U.S. apples were safe.

 In a celebration of ethnic diversity, guests sported masks and costumes from 
around the world at the Halloween party for the Collectors Council of the 
Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Host Robert Gumbiner, board chairman of FHP health services, which he founded 
in 1960, donned a Venetian carnival mask and glittering gold cape to welcome 
party-goers into his art-filled bay-side home in the Naples area of Long Beach. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Huge, intricately carved jack-o'-lanterns lit the walkway, leading guests into 
Gumbiner's stunning gallery, where hundreds of pieces of abstract figurative 
art were on view. 
</P>
<P>
 When guests weren't ogling the art collection -- most of it Latin American 
contemporary regional paintings -- they were eyeballing each other's costumes 
and telling tales of where they'd purchased them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bic Lockhart wore a monkey mask he found during a recent trip to Bali with the 
Collectors Council, an 80-strong support group of the Bowers founded by Mark 
Gumbiner (Robert's brother) and Peter Keller, the museum's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "See my jaw?" Lockhart asked, his "monkey mouth" moving as he talked. "It's 
articulated." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller wore an embroidered chief's robe from Nigeria. But he carried his Bali 
tribal mask. "It's very uncomfortable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia House, the museum's director of development, wore a kanga -- the 
African equivalent of a South Seas sarong -- and teamed it with a mask of 
feathers. "We sell the kanga at the museum gift shop," she said. "You can wear 
them 100 ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadiq Tawfiq wore the formal costume of his native Afghanistan, a 
cocoa-colored tunic with a cream silk-embroidered bodice. "When you wear one of 
these in my country it means a woman really loves you," said Tawfiq, who owns 
the Khyber Pass art gallery in Laguna Beach. "It takes a year to hand-embroider 
a piece like this. My sister made this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Seward turned heads in a cranberry-colored costume from Chajul, a 
village in the highlands of Guatemala. Colorful pompons trimmed her headdress. 
And shoulder-length strings of red acrylic thread tied with green and gold 
balls and coins accented her ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't these earrings unusual?" said Seward, who will lead a Collectors 
Council trip to Guatemala in April. "The villagers put three holes in their 
ears and string the thread through them. The beads are made of thin glass, like 
old Mardi Gras beads. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the coins were actually used during the Spanish era. When the government 
devalued them, the Indians saved the coins and used them for jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettye and Charles Peach, who collect Chinese art objects, bought their masks 
at Chinatown in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While both masks were standouts -- his portrayed a growling Asian visage, hers 
a beautiful, serene one -- Bettye's was the most exciting. It was topped by a 
gold-leaf headdress studded with stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting the chin of her mask, Bettye confided: "The headdress is actually the 
top of a 50th anniversary wreath that I found at a party store. I took the '50' 
out, put the mask in its place." 
</P>
<P>
 During the '20s, Bettye's grandmother, Mrs. E.W. Boerstler, toured China 
during a trip around the world. "We have given many of her things from that 
trip to the Bowers Museum," Bettye said. "She was really something -- decided 
to go around the world and took one cruise ship after another to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 For Collectors Council founder Mark Gumbiner, Saturday's party was a dream 
come true. "I have always wanted to give people who love cultural art an 
opportunity to get together, get involved, enhance each other's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural art is a wonderful thing because it's affordable, within everybody's 
reach. It's a big fascinating world out there -- particularly in the area of 
the folk cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 The Collectors Council (whose membership is open to any lover of cultural art) 
also enables its members to discover the world together. "We can organize trips 
you wouldn't want to do on your own," said Mark Gumbiner. "For example, after a 
recent trip to Indonesia, some of us went on to Borneo. We needed to rent a 
houseboat, so we did. You can't rent a houseboat by yourself."

BOOK REVIEW; WRITERS PEN SINFULLY GOOD ESSAYS; DEADLY SINS BY THOMAS PYNCHON,

 Sin is in again. William J. Bennett has written a bestseller about the virtues 
-- the opposites and complements of sins -- and politicians have found no 
hotter button to push than the assertion that "lack of personal responsibility" 
-- i.e., sin -- is the cause of all our problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a strange argument, because it implies that politics -- and therefore 
politicians -- don't matter. But it comes in handy. There's no need to search 
for the social origins of crime if criminals alone are to blame. There's no 
need to haul aboard the poor clinging to the middle class's foundering 
lifeboats if it's their own fault. Smack 'em with an oar if they won't let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, then, the New York Times Review of Books was riding a trend last year 
when it published these essays on the seven mortal sins listed by St. Thomas 
Aquinas (plus an eighth on the "unforgivable" sin of despair). Rather than 
preaching, though, the aim was to provoke and entertain, so famous writers -- 
those silver-tongued devils -- were asked to give us their personal views on: 
</P>
<P>
 Sloth. Thomas Pynchon traces the evolution of this sin from medieval acedia , 
an offense against God, to its current status as an offense against capitalism. 
Ben Franklin proclaimed the religion of industriousness in "Poor Richard's 
Almanac"; Melville created its fallen angel in "Bartleby the Scrivener," which 
Pynchon calls "the first great epic of modern sloth." He deplores the kind of 
"political sloth" that let Hitler rise to power, but he holds out hope for 
couch potatoes: Thanks to VCRs and remote controls, watching TV isn't as 
passive a pursuit as it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Anger. It's fun, Mary Gordon says. Anger begins as righteous indignation. It 
intoxicates. "The angry person knows without doubt that he is alive." But like 
other intoxicants, it becomes addictive. "The habit of punishment is quickly 
acquired." From suburban homes to the former Yugoslavia, rage can make us 
unrecognizable as human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lust. John Updike (who else?) notes: "Sex is a great disorderer of society -- 
the old ascetics were not wrong about that." He finds some sense in the 
"outrageous and ridiculous" religious prohibitions that liberals have scorned. 
But Updike also notes that lust "calls into activity our most elegant 
faculties, of self-display, social intercourse, and internal idealization." He 
leaves us -- as he leaves the rabbity heroes of his novels -- in "the confusion 
of this fallen world, where sins lie intermixed with the seeds of being." 
</P>
<P>
 Gluttony. William Trevor's essay is a short story about a 300-pound London 
accountant named Pinkerton. It begins with a jolliness that veteran readers of 
Trevor know won't last. Clients schmooze with Pinkerton for years without 
realizing that "his appetite lay fatally at the heart of his existence, like a 
cruel tumor." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride. A sense of family honor spurred Gore Vidal's Mississippi 
great-grandfather to fight "for a cause that he despised," the Confederacy. He 
fell at Shiloh. Vidal's grandfather, a U.S. senator, opposed the nation's entry 
into World War I. He lost his seat. Vidal himself "ran counter to the 
majority's loony superstitions about sex" in his 1948 novel "The City and the 
Pillar." He celebrates pride as Promethean when it "defies those dominations 
and powers that enslave us." 
</P>
<P>
 Avarice. How could Balzac create characters who are monsters of greed without 
condemning them? In poet Richard Howard's essay in verse, a pioneer French 
photographer taking the novelist's picture in the 1840s asks this question. 
Balzac replies: "I see no sin in loving what we own. . . . The one sin is to 
believe, indeed behave, as if we own what we love. . . . Every parent can 
conceive the fun of abusing a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Envy. Cain's envy of Abel, A.S. Byatt points out, brought "murder into the 
world." She summons up the classic personifications of envy -- Shakespeare's 
Iago, Balzac's Cousin Bette, Dickens' Uriah Heep -- to show how it differs from 
the warmer, more human emotion of jealousy. "Envy grows in the deprived and in 
those who consider themselves deprived," Byatt says; the trouble is that in the 
beginning they are often right. 
</P>
<P>
 Despair. If work is one American religion, optimism is another. Despair, Joyce 
Carol Oates says, is a kind of heresy -- "a state of intense inwardness, thus 
independence." Expressions of despair, such as some of Emily Dickinson's poems, 
can be "the voice we trust" when society's cheerleading sounds hollow. "For, if 
despair's temptations can be resisted, surely we become more human and 
compassionate."

 MOUSE PARTY: If you're taking advantage of the free Disneyland entry this 
morning -- for those in Halloween costume only -- the party centers around the 
Haunted Mansion. Don't be surprised if the crowd is huge. . . . "This is 
certainly a first for us," said John McClintock, spokesman for the Anaheim 
amusement park. But be aware of the rules: Doors open at 6 a.m. but nobody gets 
in free after 8:30 a.m. And no offensive or dangerous costumes. . . . The park 
will open as many rides as it can at that hour, McClintock said, depending on 
crowd size. 
</P>
<P>
 PUMPKIN HEAVEN: If you like lots of pumpkins, Fashion Island in Newport Beach 
should have enough to keep you happy today: nine tons, give or take a pound, in 
its Pumpkin Patch display. . . . All 18 shopping centers in Irvine and Newport 
Beach have aligned for special Halloween events today. A sampling: a haunted 
house at the Walnut Village Center, a costume contest at the Irvine Marketplace 
and a parade at Newport Hills F2. 
</P>
<P>
 FRANK TALK: The Children's Crusade Against Tobacco Use wasn't about to pass up 
this chance. The president-elect of the Orange County Medical Assn. happens to 
be a lung specialist, and very anti-smoking. . . . And his name happens to be 
Frankenstein -- Dr. Richard S. Frankenstein. He'll join more than 200 young 
people -- all in costume -- today at the old County Courthouse in Santa Ana for 
a Halloween anti-smoking rally. . . . Frankenstein knows exploitation when he 
sees it -- the ad says "Dr. Frankenstein Wants You" -- but says he doesn't 
mind: "Halloween is my favorite holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 TIPS FOR GHOULS: Halloween ranks up there with Christmas for a lot of 
youngsters. But the Adam Walsh Center in Orange, which lobbies to protect 
exploited children, urges parents to follow some common sense tips about 
trick-or-treating: Never let them go alone, have them carry a glow stick or 
reflective clothing, make sure masks don't mar breathing, and parents inspect 
all treats. Says Laura Henry from the center: "This is a potentially dangerous 
time for our children."

STREET SMART: AN OUT-OF-SYNC FREEWAY PROJECT KEEPS CAR-POOL LANES CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am interested in knowing when the car-pool lanes on the Riverside Freeway 
east and west between the San Gabriel River Freeway and Valley View Avenue will 
be open. I car-pool this segment of freeway daily and do not understand why it 
has not opened. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fully painted and has signs in place, but they are covered with 
cardboard. It has been this way for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Anderson 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that although the car-pool lane on the Los Angeles County side 
of the Riverside Freeway is completed, work on the car-pool lane on the Orange 
County side hasn't begun.  
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. lane isn't open because it comes to an abrupt end at the Orange 
County line, and there isn't enough room for drivers to move safely into 
regular freeway traffic lanes, according to Rose Orem of Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons that the timing of the two lanes is so out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that workers in Los Angeles only had to re-stripe the car-pool lane, 
but on our side of the county line, major reconstruction is needed. Caltrans 
must widen the shoulder and redesign some of the on- and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans finished work on the L.A. side on schedule in late September. 
Caltrans in Orange County, however, timed its car-pool lane work to coincide 
with the massive Interstate 5 improvement project, with which the car-pool lane 
will connect. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on our car pool lane is scheduled to begin in January, 1997, and finish 
by May, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to all the wood that is used for supports while the freeway 
overpasses are being constructed? I understand it is just thrown away. Is this 
true? 
</P>
<P>
 Jean C. Falconer 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 No. The supports, called "falsework," are the property of the contractor, who 
will reuse it in different jobs until it has worn out its usefulness. Then the 
wood is recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection of Beach and Whittier boulevards in La Habra is very 
confusing and dangerous to bicyclists. If you are traveling northbound on Beach 
Boulevard, there is a sign for bicyclists needing to cross the east leg that 
says "Bicyclists Walk Bikes." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is no crosswalk, there are no pedestrian signals, and the 
entire time the green signal is illuminated, there is also a green right-turn 
arrow displayed for cars. The last thing the motorists expect to see when 
turning right on a green arrow is a bicyclist walking his bike across a street 
that does not have a crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the length of the green signal is not adequate to allow a person 
to safely cross the street while pushing a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this is a liability for Caltrans, and that they might want to consider 
prohibiting pedestrian crossing on the east leg, and re-stripe Beach Boulevard 
to better accommodate bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Gallagher 
</P>
<P>
 Brea 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans already has plans to remove this sign in the first week of December 
to eliminate confusion, according to Orem. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign, which is on the south leg of the intersection, was intended for 
bicyclists crossing Beach Boulevard on the south, Orem said.  
</P>
<P>
 The east leg of this intersection has neither a crosswalk nor a pedestrian 
signal because pedestrians are not supposed to cross there, Orem said.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans plans to install additional signs to warn pedestrians and cyclists 
that no crossing is allowed and to direct them to the three other legs of the 
intersection that do permit pedestrian crossing. This work also should be done 
by the first week in December. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority will conduct a public hearing Nov. 
14 to consider an additional feature to ACCESS, the van transportation service 
for seniors and people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA wants to provide same-day service for people who need it but have not 
made the required 48-hour reservation. The new service is intended for people 
with urgent need for transportation that day, such as an unplanned medical 
appointment. It would cost $5 each way plus $1 for every five miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be at 9 a.m. in the Orange County Planning Commission Hearing 
Room, Hall of Administration, 10 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana. If the feature 
is approved, it will go into effect Jan. 1.

L.A. POLICE HAMPERED BY WOEFUL STATE OF EQUIPMENT; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHORT ON 
HIGH-TECH HELP, OFFICERS SPEND AS MUCH AS 40% OF THEIR TIME FILLING OUT 
PAPERWORK. MODERNIZATION EFFORT HAS BEEN LEFT LARGELY TO PRIVATE DONORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In today's Los Angeles Police Department, computers are scarce, cars are worn 
out, fingerprint equipment years out of date. Even the basic supplies that 
fortify almost all modern offices -- fax machines and voice mail, for instance 
-- are all but unheard-of at the LAPD, where officers are lucky to get their 
own phone and an electric typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortages are felt in ways large and small: When residents call for 
emergency assistance, they sometimes languish on hold with a recording, wasting 
precious minutes before even speaking to an operator. When officers in the San 
Fernando Valley recently sought a suspected child molester, their efforts were 
hampered by the lack of department computers. They had no central file to 
review for clues about similar crimes in other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And when, during the January earthquake, Police Department leaders scrambled 
to deploy officers throughout the city, they were hamstrung by their inability 
to determine instantly who was at work. Each of the LAPD's divisions had to 
call in its roll, and the results had to be hand tabulated for department brass 
to assess how many people were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Day in, day out, the dearth of computers and the shortage of other high-tech 
equipment forces LAPD officers to spend as much as 40% of their time filling 
out paperwork, a tedious task that takes them out of the field even as Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams and Mayor Richard Riordan are leading a push to put 
more police on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Riordan Administration has aggressively secured city funds to 
hire new officers, the modernization of the LAPD has been largely left to 
private donors. Some have given large contributions and a massive private 
fund-raising effort is under way. Its goal, to raise $15 million, is thought to 
be the largest private campaign ever waged on behalf of a city police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials applaud those efforts as well as the drive to expand the Police 
Department. But some worry that the emphasis on adding officers has attracted 
such public attention that it has eclipsed the department's woefully inadequate 
technological shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Councilwoman Laura Chick has convened a special meeting of the 
council's Public Safety Committee for today. Department leaders say they will 
concede during that session that the LAPD, which once considered itself the 
nation's most modern police department, has fallen perilously behind the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The processing of information in this department is woefully inefficient," 
said Bill Russell, commanding officer of the LAPD's support services bureau. 
"That affects every aspect of our operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a dangerously pitiful position at this time," she said. "I've been 
saying that the LAPD is still back in the days of Joe Friday and "Dragnet." 
What would be more accurate is to say that we're back in the days of Wyatt 
Earp." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, she and other leaders agree, has been years in the making. Tight 
budgets in the 1980s and early 1990s made deferring investment in new equipment 
a popular way of cutting costs -- with some of the consequences only recently 
beginning to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a recent infusion of cars has begun to make things better, LAPD 
vehicles have been allowed to accumulate damage and mileage for years. Many in 
the Police Department's stock of vehicles have more than 100,000 miles, and 
some are in notoriously bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, for the better part of a decade, modern equipment -- cellular 
phones, computers, facsimile machines -- has gone unpurchased as city leaders 
have devoted scarce resources to hiring officers or paying for other 
priorities. Other LAPD facilities such as its crime lab, which has come under 
intense scrutiny during the O.J. Simpson murder case, also have been allowed to 
fall behind the times. Today, the lab sends much of its work to outside 
companies for testing because its equipment is so out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 What little modern technology the department owns has mostly been donated, and 
one result is that computers in one division often do not communicate with 
those just a few miles away. That was evident earlier this year when LAPD 
officers were hunting for a suspected child molester in the San Fernando 
Valley. No single LAPD computerized database contains information on child 
molesters, so information collected in one division is not easily available to 
detectives in another. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to look for patterns across the city," said one detective. 
"You have to rely on what people remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the decay of the LAPD more evident than at its older police 
stations. In Hollywood, locker rooms are cramped, supplies are hard to come by 
and there's barely breathing space between the desks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I move my desk one inch forward, it blocks the captain's door," said Sgt. 
Harry Ryon, an LAPD veteran who works in Hollywood. "If I move it one inch 
back, I can't get in behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions are no better at the 77th Street Division, nestled in the heart of 
South-Central Los Angeles. That police station was in such disrepair a few 
years back that crews had to lop off the second story for fear that it would 
collapse. A stairway now leads from the first floor straight into a brick wall 
-- officers call the steps the "stairs to nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans already have been drafted for a new police station at 77th Street, but 
one delay has followed the next. "We'll believe it when we see it," grumbled 
one station sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Newton Street station in the heart of the city, homicide detectives 
work cheek by jowl at long wooden tables. There is no privacy, no place to lock 
up reports, no place to confer privately with witnesses other than dingy 
interview rooms. Desks are so cramped that officers often put their telephones 
in wastepaper baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a trip to Newton Street that helped persuade Bruce Karatz, chairman of 
Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., that private efforts were needed to help revive the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go into Newton Division and you just can't believe it," said Karatz, who 
chairs the Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A., the group spearheading fund 
raising for the Police Department. "In fact, the more I see of the LAPD, the 
more shocked I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Karatz's leadership, the alliance hopes to raise $15 million to donate 
to the department to jump-start modernization of the LAPD, starting with the 
purchase of a badly needed computer system. As it is, the LAPD has 721 computer 
terminals for roughly 10,000 employees. And even the ones it has are a mishmash 
of antiquated units, some of which cannot communicate with each other, 
rendering them all but useless for anything other than typing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the alliance and Police Department analysts, the new computer 
system could have a more immediate impact on public safety than Riordan's 
Police Department expansion plan. Department officials estimate that when 
they're fully up and running, the computers could free up 640,000 hours of 
police officer time a year -- the equivalent of 350 additional officers. 
</P>
<P>
 And with luck, Russell said, the new computers could be in place within a 
year. That alone could increase police officers' productivity by as much as 
25%, he said, increasing the number of arrests they can make and adding to the 
time that they can spend patrolling their communities and meeting with 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, modest improvements at stations have shown the potential benefits of 
equipment improvements. Sgt. Craig Crosby, a technologically minded supervisor 
at the West Valley station, designed a new-and-improved method for collecting 
fingerprints from a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system simplifies labeling for fingerprint cards and makes tracking 
the status of fingerprints simpler. Neither is an especially dramatic 
innovation, but the system already has succeeded in doubling the capacity of 
the West Valley station for lifting and analyzing prints. 
</P>
<P>
 As they look to the future, LAPD officials hope first to bring their 
department into the modern age of technology and then to take advantage of even 
more advanced tools that could give police the edge on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, technology that might allow police to use remote control 
to disable fleeing vehicles. Police chases are expensive and dangerous, often 
ending in accidents that leave bystanders as well as police and suspects hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had a device that could disable cars, think of the advantages," Russell 
said. "That's the kind of innovation we need to be exploring." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, whose hearings this week will feature testimony from LAPD officials and 
representatives of various high-tech companies, said she hopes to hear ideas 
for short- and long-term improvements. And while she is confident that private 
industry can supply the department with the computers it needs to take the 
first step, she and other officials are concerned that many more advances are 
needed if the LAPD is to regain its lost stature as one of the nation's most 
advanced police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of educating the public is getting them to understand that just hiring 
more police is not the answer," she said. "If we don't make these improvements, 
these new officers will waste all their time filling out paperwork and looking 
for a place to sit."

MAN SLAIN FOR A BEER IS FAMILY'S 4TH GUN VICTIM; CRIME: KILLER 'GRABBED THE 
BEER AND . . . WALKED AWAY LIKE IT WAS NOTHING,' WITNESSES TO THE FLORENCE-AREA 
SHOOTING SAY. DEPUTIES REPORT NO SUSPECTS.

 The blue plastic shopping cart David Stewart wheeled around his Florence-area 
neighborhood, collecting cans and bottles to recycle for cash, still sat on 
Mary Avenue on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, however, were the man who pushed the cart early every morning -- and the 
can of beer that authorities say led to his murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He was shot to death about 7 a.m. Sunday in front of a house on Mary Avenue, 
sheriff's deputies said, after an unidentified gunman apparently demanded that 
Stewart hand over the can of beer he had just bought at a neighborhood liquor 
store not far from where he lived with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, says his mother, Catherine, David Stewart's picture will join those of 
two brothers and a sister, also killed by guns, in a memorial collage that 
hangs on the wall of the family's apartment, near where Stewart was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stewart, 42, refused to give up the beer, his assailant shot him several 
times, witnesses told sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the gunman "grabbed the beer and left. . . . He walked away like it was 
nothing," said one eyewitness, a San Pedro woman who was visiting her mother, 
who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sunday night, Sheriff's Deputy Brian Jones said, there were no suspects. 
The gunman "was seen drinking the beer and calmly walking away," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and friends said Stewart left home about 5 a.m. every day on a 
regular scavenging route that usually ended three hours later, after he cashed 
in his recyclables and bought himself a six-pack of beer and some cigarettes to 
share with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 So when his parents heard a knock on the door at 8 a.m. Sunday, they thought 
it was their son, returning to the apartment. Instead, it was sheriff's 
deputies, with news of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my son. He was my world. He was all a mother wanted in a son," his 
mother said Sunday. She rested under a blanket on a living-room couch after 
returning from the hospital where she was taken briefly after being told she 
had lost her fourth child to violence. "It looks like it's just going to kill 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's cousin, Flora Scott, described him as "a nice person who had respect 
for his fellow man, but was not the type who would let you take his 
belongings." It is "so degrading," she said, "to kill a man for a can of beer 
-- that's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart was on government disability since being shot in the back during a 
fight in the 1970s, his family said. With his disability check and money from 
his scavenging route, he helped with rent and expenses at the apartment he 
shared with his parents and his surviving brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor recalled seeing him on his usual route. "He didn't bother 
anybody. He'd just give you a friendly 'hi' and go on his way," said Bonnie 
Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 And so when she learned that Stewart had been killed -- and how -- Beavers 
said, "I just couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 From where they sit on the steps of a nearby apartment building, Jerry Bailey 
and his friends would see Stewart every day on his way home from the market 
where he recycled his wares. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just one of the regular fellows, like us," said Bailey, 34. "He was a 
nice person; you can't put it any more bluntly than that."

THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN; WOODLAND HILLS PASTOR HAS BAG OF TRICKS TO GET ACROSS 
LESSONS IN TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shedding his ministerial robe to reveal a tuxedo, a Woodland Hills Methodist 
pastor preached a pre-Halloween sermon Sunday on magicians and mystics, aided 
by playing cards, multiplying money and willing volunteers from the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Gilbert Stones, a member of Hollywood's Magic Castle club for 10 
years, even pulled a rabbit out of an apparently empty black box before a 
congregation of about 50 at Woodland Hills United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before Halloween seemed appropriate to put his semi-professional 
talents to use and to make a point, said the 39-year-old preacher with 
handlebar mustache and Van Dyke beard. 
</P>
<P>
 People who seek out magicians to help deal with life's problems are not really 
getting the help they need, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't lack for magicians, but we lack for mystics -- people who recognize 
that sometimes things just happen," Stones said. "Magicians don't like 
surprises. Mystics delight in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence of religion is letting God break through rather than scrambling 
around trying to control everything," said the minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's hymns and prayers focused on the mystery and majesty of the Divine, 
and the New Testament reading was the Book of  
</P>
<P>
 Acts' account of the conversion of Simon the magician. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the serious themes in the service, the people in the pews applauded 
and laughed as Stones used sleight of hand, familiar magician props and 
bantering comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioner Jack Smeltzer, who held a playing card he thought he had chosen 
from a deck, was told that the rabbit Stones had produced was going to read his 
mind and identify the card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make your mind a blank," Stones said, adding quickly, "That was fast." 
</P>
<P>
 While rabbits can't talk, "he's going to do something that rabbits can do -- 
no, not that." 
</P>
<P>
 After the laughter subsided, the minister-magus showed the congregants a 
newspaper page that had three diamond shapes apparently "chewed" out of it by 
the rabbit. And sure enough, Smeltzer held the three of diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man supplied a $5 bill that the pastor seemed to change into a $1 
bill. "That's my $4 trick," Stones said. Later, he repeatedly dropped two or 
three dollars into a box, and yet continued to count seven $1 bills still in 
his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if you could do that, you'd probably give a little more to the church," 
he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to his message on mystics and magicians, Stones said that the 
magician claims special knowledge and methods to get information about certain 
mysteries, and perhaps to change circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, mystics "simply seek to contact, to touch and commune 
with the mysteries beyond," not necessarily hoping for full understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Some use of "magic" is fine, even in church, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we pray and ask God to do something, we are doing 'OK magic,' " Stones 
said. But because magicians of various kinds can't always make everything work 
as predicted, excuses are often offered -- the conditions were not right, the 
supplicant did not believe enough. 
</P>
<P>
 With magicians, "sometimes people get prayed for and they don't get cured," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, "the mystic knows that if you pray for healing, you may not be 
cured, but you will be healed," he said. "Your life will be touched and 
transformed -- you'll never be the same." 
</P>
<P>
 In his closing prayer, Stones said, "Forgive our arrogance in those times when 
we think we know fully your mind and that we have all the answers."

MOTHER, UNCLE OF 2 INMATES HELD IN PLOT TO KILL WITNESSES; CRIME: POLICE SAY 
PICO RIVERA RESIDENTS WANTED REVENGE ON FOUR NEIGHBORS WHOSE TESTIMONY HELPED 
CONVICT TEEN-AGERS OF MURDER TWO YEARS AGO.

<P>
 Two years after a pair of teen-age brothers were sent to prison for murder, 
their mother and an uncle have been arrested on suspicion of plotting the 
murder-for-hire of four neighbors whose testimony sent the brothers to prison, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Gonzales, 37, and her brother, Thomas Hiromoto, 38, both of Pico Rivera, 
were arrested by sheriff's investigators Saturday night after being under 
surveillance for some time.They were booked on suspicion of solicitation and 
conspiracy to commit murder, and were held on $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to perform an execution," Deputy Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiromoto was also booked on suspicion of selling heroin and possession of a 
sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokesmen described the motive for the murder-for-hire plan as 
"revenge." The intended targets were four neighbors whose testimony helped 
convict two of Susan Gonzales' sons two years ago. Steven Gonzales, 20, and his 
brother Andrew, 18, were convicted of murder, Erickson said. Details of the 
crime were not available late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested two other family members on unrelated charges Saturday. 
Susan Gonzales' sister, Dale Pallan, 33, was booked on suspicion of conspiracy 
to distribute heroin. And a 14-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possessing 
a handgun and stolen property, and was being held in juvenile hall.

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW : 1903 SHOOTING CASE WAS THE O.J. SIMPSON 
TRIAL OF ITS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As arguments over the validity and admissibility of DNA testing continue to 
unfold in the O.J. Simpson trial, so does one of the most striking coincidences 
in U.S. legal history. 
</P>
<P>
 For it was in another Los Angeles courtroom nearly 100 years ago that a now 
universally accepted form of scientific evidence -- ballistics -- first was 
introduced in an American criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do the parallels end there. Like the Simpson case, the earlier trial was 
the object of unprecedented media attention and involved one of the era's most 
famous defense attorneys, Earl Rogers, who used the infant science of 
ballistics to prove that his clients -- three police officers -- were innocent 
of the murders of a father and son. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings occurred in the midst of a local newspaper war and, as coverage 
of the case snowballed, many Angelenos were convinced that "our noble boys in 
blue" were guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the turn of the century, Los Angeles was enmeshed in an endless cycle of 
scandals. Police were often depicted as bumblers, bribe-takers or both. One 
newspaper called the three accused officers "desperadoes in uniform," 
"coldblooded assassins" and "bloodthirsty morons."  
</P>
<P>
 The case began on Dec. 17, 1903, when three Los Angeles police officers -- 
Bert Cowan, Johnny Murphy and J. J. Hawley -- shot and killed two allegedly 
unarmed horse thieves, Joe and Louis Choisser. 
</P>
<P>
 The father and son had apparently purchased a herd of horses and mules in 
Illinois with a bad check for $1,500 and sold the animals before arriving in 
Los Angeles with their profits and no intention of making their check good. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff of Harding County, Ill., issued a warrant for their arrest and 
sent a telegram to Los Angeles Police Chief Charles Elton, offering a $50 
reward for their capture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police determined that the pair were staying at the Hotel Broxburn on 5th 
Street between Hill and Broadway. Officers Hawley and Murphy nervously awaited 
the Choissers' return in a cramped third-floor bathroom, while Cowan staked out 
the hotel's back entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the father and son arrived, the officers knocked on the Choissers' door. 
A furious gun battle began when one officer yelled, "Open up in the name of the 
law." Joe Choisser soon lay dead in the room and his son in the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers would later testify that Joe Choisser was sitting on the bed with 
his back to them when they kicked the door open. As Choisser reached for his 
gun, which was lying on the bed, Hawley lunged forward and tried to grab it. A 
struggle followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Choisser reportedly yelled, "Kill them Lou, kill them!" From behind the 
bedroom door, Lou Choisser opened fire, barely missing the officers, who had 
begun shooting as they backed out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Choisser was killed with one bullet through his heart. In his pocket was 
$1,700 cash. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cowan heard the shots, he came running up the back stairway, just in time 
to see Lou Choisser shooting at Murphy and Hawley in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan shot young Choisser in the back while two of Murphy's bullets hit him in 
the chest. Choisser died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared to be a simple case of three cops killing two armed crooks who 
resisted arrest. The gunfire itself was not enough to make the front page of a 
newspaper in those bawdy days. But in an era of circulation wars and yellow 
journalism, one paper's headlines the next day read: "Cops Kill Two in Cold 
Blood" although another newspaper headline reported: "Criminals Opened Fire on 
Officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Public pressure built, and the officers were arrested and charged with murder. 
To make matters worse, the Choissers' guns disappeared and a hotel guest became 
a star prosecution witness, testifying that he never saw the Choissers fire at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, the city's best-known defense attorney, decided that because of all 
the media attention, finding an impartial jury would be next to impossible. The 
only way he could win would be at a preliminary hearing, where he needed to 
convince only the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The best detectives in the Los Angeles Police Department -- for once working 
for the defense -- combed the hotel's corridor. They found bullet holes and 
bullets in the walls and door jamb opposite the Choissers' room -- marks the 
prosecution either failed to see or ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, all the books on the embryonic science of ballistics had been 
published only in German, which Rogers, a master of foreign languages, happened 
to read. 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing, Superior Court Judge Joseph Fleischman Chambers 
seemed to be the only one with any interest in or knowledge of ballistics. 
Everyone else in the courtroom appeared bewildered, including prosecutors, who 
said that "ballistics had no more right in the courtroom than a magician 
pulling rabbits out of a hat." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' star witness, Jesse Hawley (not related to one of the defendants), a 
ballistics expert trained in Germany, offered to take bullets from any guns and 
match them correctly with the gun that had fired them. But the prosecution 
would not "descend to such nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley testified that in making a chemical analysis, he found that Los Angeles 
police bullets were made of solid lead with small amounts of copper fused into 
the nose. But the bullets found in Louis Choisser's pocket, like the ones found 
in the wall and door jamb, had an element of tin mixed with the lead and lacked 
the copper ingredient of the police slugs.  
</P>
<P>
 Hawley also found in the wall a residue of the same oily substance that 
lubricated the Choissers' bullets, while police bullets left a wax base in the 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The last significant piece of defense evidence was a picture taken shortly 
after the gunfight. It showed a pile of undisturbed dust that had collected on 
top of the transom above a hotel room door. It was through the open transom of 
the door that the prosecution's star witness claimed to have witnessed the 
three officers gun down the two unarmed men. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge dismissed the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The final headline about the case read: "Witness Admits Being in Pay of Yellow 
Journalism." CECILIA RASMUSSEN

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; HAS 
THE INITIATIVE PROCESS, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO LET THE PEOPLE BE HEARD, GONE 
AMOK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Election Day a week away, there is fever-pitch campaigning not only by 
the candidates but for the five initiatives as well. The stakes in this 
election are high as these measures will likely be around long after any of the 
politicians leave office.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider the tax-slashing Proposition 13, which the voters approved in 1978 at 
a time of budgetary surplus in Sacramento. "Proposition 13 is emblematic of 
what the initiative process is about," says H. Eric Schockman, a political 
science professor at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ultimately represented the will of the people at that time and they 
determined the future of California and how it developed," Schockman says. 
"Proposition 13 was a Draconian piece of legislation that started the decline 
of California. We're paying now for the greed of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Some worry that, if passed, the initiatives will have a negative effect on the 
prison system, immigration and local control over limiting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not an overwhelming number of initiatives on the ballot this year 
but those that do appear are very hot-button political issues," says Ruth 
Holton, executive director of Common Cause. "The public is frustrated. They're 
angry. They feel they haven't seen the Legislature take action, particularly 
with immigration and crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Legislature did act on one issue: crime. Earlier this year, 
the state passed a "three strikes" law that requires mandatory sentences for 
repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Community Essay, former Glendale fire Capt. John L. Orr, who is 
serving a prison term for arson, argues that the "three strikes" law is having 
a chilling effect on inmates. With a "three-strikes" law already on the books, 
why have another, especially one that would require a two-thirds vote of the 
Legislature to change? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer most likely lies with understanding the initiative process. Begun 
at the turn of the century by a former governor, Hiram Johnson, initiatives 
were designed to overcome legislative gridlock by allowing any citizen to 
propose a law and take it directly to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, we have seen special interests usurping the political process and 
we've seen craven politicians back initiatives for political advantage," says 
Harvey Rosenfeld, a public interest lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than initiatives being an exercise in democracy, we are using the 
process to bring out the worst in people," adds Rosenfeld, who was the force 
behind Proposition 103 in 1988, which was aimed at controlling automobile 
insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of next week's election may not be greater restrictions on 
immigration or a massive prison system for the growing inmate population. The 
long-term effect may be whether ordinary citizens still believe that 
initiatives speak for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country has never been able to function as a direct democracy," 
Schockman says. "This particular anomaly is a Frankenstein creation that has 
come back to haunt us."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION / WITH 
RAE FRANKLIN JAMES; 'LEARN BUDGETS, LEARN FINANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By When Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan went on vacation this month, DEPUTY 
MAYOR RAE FRANKLIN JAMES found herself handling major controversies about 
subway construction and a proposed camping area for the homeless on her own. 
James leaped from the obscurity of the city legislative analyst's office to the 
local spotlight without ever having met Riordan before taking the jobshe was 
recommended to him by a trusted aide. Her areas of responsibility include 
environmental matters and community redevelopment as well as transportation and 
housing. James, 45, was interviewed at her spacious but modestly furnished 
office on the 3rd floor of City Hall (down the hall from the mayor's) by KAY 
MILLS, author of This Little Light of Mine: The Life of Fannie Lou Hamer 
(Plume, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: When the mayor named you to this job, what was his charge to you?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: He said, "Do you think you can make the hard decisions? Do you think 
you can stand up for a conviction and be able to face a confrontation that goes 
along with it and realize that I'm going to hold you accountable the whole 
time?" I said, "Yes." I felt comfortable with that. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know me, I didn't know him. I was referred by Bill McCarley, then 
chief of staff. I had worked with Bill in the legislative analyst's office for 
City Council for about five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What ' s your background?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm from Oakland, went to UC Berkeley and did my graduate work at Cal State 
Hayward in public policy finance. 
</P>
<P>
 I started my career in personnel. I was working for the Lawrence Livermore 
Laboratory and later Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, doing organizational 
consulting -- looking at morale problems, trying to examine why one unit was 
more productive than another. 
</P>
<P>
 I kept coming up against this wall called the budget. Things that needed to 
get done were always turned down because of the budget. Also, I realized that 
the soft sciences didn't have a lot of credibility. I had a great mentor, a 
scientist at the Berkeley labs, who said, "You know, female, black, you better 
get into another field because you're going to hit a wall. You need to get into 
something that matters. Money matters. Learn about budgets. Learn about 
finance." 
</P>
<P>
 I also had this sort of liberal leaning toward public policy issues. I wanted 
to be a legislative analyst in Sacramento. Being able to communicate policy to 
lay people so that they understand what they are voting for and realize the 
implication it might have on their own lives was very important. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After you had worked in Sacramento, what brought you to Los Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I guess my curiosity, as you can tell, leads my life. I wanted to know what 
it was like to work in the private sector. So I took a position as senior 
financial analyst with World Airways in Oakland. I was recruited back to 
Berkeley to work for a genetic engineering laboratory, Cetus Corp. I caught the 
eye of a headhunter who was working in Los Angeles, looking on behalf of the 
Community Redevelopment Agency. The agency had gone through a lot of negative 
press and realized they didn't have any way of accounting for their budget or 
expenditures. I came in 1983 and worked for CRA for about six years.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was it like for you, a Northern Californian, to move to L.A.?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My family thinks I'm in Afghanistan. My mother writes me letters and sends 
me clippings of things that are going on in Los Angeles. I say, "Mom, I'm here. 
I know." It was quite an adjustment. But since I've been here, now 10 years, 
the people, the city -- I've grown into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you a Democrat or a Republican?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of doors did learning about budgets and finance help open for 
you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You could "be with the big boys." To this day, it does not surprise me to 
come into a room where there are no females, no people of color. It's very 
common still; then, it was even more common. So the doors that it affords you 
are that you get to be at the table when the decisions are made. To me, that 
makes you a player. You're there at prioritizing time. You're determining the 
quality of the decisions as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of what I do is working with the departments, making sure that they 
implement the mayor's program. The mayor says, "Well, I said something on 
Monday, and Wednesday it's like it went nowhere. Like I was speaking without a 
voice." I make sure they follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you're on your own time, what kinds of things do you do?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Since I've had this job, I've taken up needlepoint because a friend told me 
it was good for stress, although I don't know what happens when you have 
stressful needlepoint. I love to write. I don't write as much as I used to. I 
was more disciplined before I got here. I read everything: fiction, 
non-fiction. Sportswise, I ski. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there things about city government that you're still curious about?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My curiosity about city government is more along the lines of 
implementation. I don't know if you're familiar with the Los Angeles 
Neighborhood Initiative, which is a little program that I created. Now I want 
to see that implemented and see if community empowerment works. 
</P>
<P>
 I was really struck hard, as we all were, by the riots of April, 1992. I 
realized that people felt disconnected from their neighborhoods, from their 
lives, from their government. Therefore, everything was vulnerable, everything 
was fair game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too much to identify with Los Angeles, but if you know your little 
four-block-square area with the grocery store on the corner or the park or the 
church, that's your neighborhood. We had lost that. Suppose we let government 
step out of the way and said, "These are your neighborhoods, take ownership, 
get connected." I pitched this to the federal government and just recently we 
had $2.3 million awarded by the feds to work with eight neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What drives you in public service?  
</P>
<P>
 A: A child of the '60s, I always believed that an individual can make a 
difference. In my case, I guess I've always believed I should make a 
difference. I believe that lasting change is incremental. Revolutions rarely 
work. Blowing up things rarely works. It happens for a few years, then you have 
this backlash because it was not institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that you can't change everything, you have to get your issues down 
to sizes that you can change. If you just affect one person, you'd be 
surprised. That person could affect something else. 
</P>
<P>
 People talk about "the system," about government. We are government, we are 
the system, so you can't say it's something outside of you. I used to say to my 
sons, "Did you vote? You're 18 years old: Vote. That was fought for." You have 
to participate in government. It's not something that you can look at and 
complain about.

 I'd been back from Vietnam several years before it started: first a rash, then 
more serious symptoms. For a time I couldn't walk. I needed radiation and four 
operations, and got a kind of skin cancer. All of it from when I was in Vietnam 
patrolling through foliage that the U.S. government had sprayed with the 
chemical Agent Orange. For at least 10 years the government denied Agent Orange 
had made me sick but in October, l993, they admitted it and put me on 100% 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been a telephone technician for 15 years. I'd always been super-active, 
never sick. As things got worse, I had to quit. I went into a bad depression. 
My wife, Betty -- we've been married 27 years -- was my backbone. She hadn't 
worked in 15 years, but as soon as I got sick she found a full-time job. My 
daughters helped too.  
</P>
<P>
 My friends from work helped pull me through. DeMorris Wilson, a secretary at 
Pacific Bell, collected money for a barbecue where 25 or so people came to my 
house and cleaned up my yard, cut trees, everything. Three other special 
friends from my tech crew -- we were called the Four Stooges -- have been 
terrific. Kenny Williams and Jose Mejias have called every day. They bring 
gifts, cheer me up, offer to do anything I need. Jimmy Aldridge calls and 
drives me anywhere I want to go. When I was depressed, crying all the time, he 
came by constantly to talk to and encourage me. HAIGAN CHEA

 I was 15 when I arrived in the United States and had lived through a lifetime 
of terrible experiences. I was living in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge took 
over.  
</P>
<P>
 I arrived in 1979 with seven of my relatives. Three Cambodian families crowded 
together in a three-bedroom house in Long Beach agreed to sponsor us and let us 
move into their living room. These were the families of Savann Sep, Yim Chay 
and Nelson Neang. I will always be very grateful to them. 
</P>
<P>
 I could not speak English and had only a few years of schooling. Do you know 
what it is like to be in a strange land, surrounded by strangers, and then one 
person becomes the center of your life for a while because of his kindness? For 
me this was Robert DeCordes, my English teacher. Robert cared, and his 
listening was like therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 He encouraged me to enroll in electronics at Lakewood High School where he was 
then teaching (I am now an electrical engineer). One day a rumor went around 
school that the Ku Klux Klan would come and hurt non-whites. We were all very 
afraid. I went to Robert and he explained how America is a land of all 
immigrants, and helped me calm down. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years I have paid from my own pocket and worked to help found and 
organize the United Cambodian Students of America. Knowing how much it means to 
be helped, I am very glad that I have the opportunity and capability to help 
others. THUY NGUYEN REED

 One night after I had been in the United States only seven months and could 
hardly speak English, I was so unhappy that I left my American husband without 
telling anyone. I had exactly $27, and bought a bus ticket to Amarillo, Tex., 
where I had one Vietnamese friend. 
</P>
<P>
 After I had lived in Amarillo several months I realized I was pregnant. The 
father was someone I hardly knew. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very desperate. I had no one to turn to, especially not my Vietnamese 
friends because I felt they would find me shameful. If I had wanted an abortion 
it was too late, and I had no money to pay for the child's birth and no way to 
support it. Finally, I contacted my mother-in-law, Mary Ann Reed, of Redondo 
Beach. When I told her my situation, although she knew it was not her son's 
baby, still she asked no questions and gave me no disrespect. She only said: 
"Come on out here, Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 My husband had re-enlisted and was not in the country. But Mrs. Reed and her 
husband and three other children let me live with them until the baby was born. 
I gave birth to a happy little girl, now 16. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I divorced, and he remarried. After all these years he is like 
a relative. And the rest of the Reeds have been like a family to my daughter 
and myself. I will always love Mary Ann. CONSTANCE SEDLECEK

 I was 17 and three months pregnant when my boyfriend and I moved into a motel 
in Bend, Ore., owned by Frank Ziegler. There was physical abuse in my home so I 
couldn't stay there. 
</P>
<P>
 My boyfriend was 18, on drugs and in and out of jail. We had no money for rent 
so I offered to clean rooms to pay.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank was more than 70 years old, a big guy who'd been a lumberjack and had 
been through a lot of life's trials. One day he saw a hole in the motel room 
wall where my boyfriend had slammed my head up against it. Frank told my 
boyfriend that I could stay as long as I wanted, but that if he ever hit me 
again he'd throw him out. He often talked to me, too, telling me that someday 
I'd realize my boyfriend was wrong for me. My boyfriend did hit me again and 
Frank threw him out.  
</P>
<P>
 When my baby was born I developed blood clots in my lungs and heart and had to 
stay in the hospital six weeks. Frank paid for a lot of my expenses. He never 
wanted a thing back from me. He believes in doing the right thing and tried to 
teach that to me. 
</P>
<P>
 My little girl is six now and he is her godfather. I call him on Father's Day. 
I'll always remember how he came into my life at its darkest hour and believed 
in me and helped me.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WHAT I'VE LEARNED; A 
CALL FOR ASIAN ARTISTS TO RECAST IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By An Oscar and Tony nominee, MAKO is a founder of East-West Players, Los 
Angeles' premier forum for Asian American actors and writers. This summer, he 
directed a radio series, Contemporary Japanese Short Stories, for KCRW-FM. He 
was interviewed for The Times by JAMES BLAIR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I chose the theater as my profession. In those days Asian American actors went 
out for characters designated as Chinese or Japanese or Chinese or Japanese 
American. In 1965 I and six others founded the East-West Players Asian American 
Theater Co. All of us -- actors of different Asian ethnicities -- were so fed 
up (with the lack of opportunities) that we decided to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing I learned very early on was to collaborate: Whether you're dealing 
with directors, writers, producers or designers, there's got to be give and 
take. Even as artistic director I had to do a lot of mundane tasks such as 
mopping up the theater before the show. That, too, was a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I think more than anything else we gave a place for Asian American writers. We 
felt that if a group were to project more positive images through productions, 
we could begin to break the stereotypical images. At East-West we would work on 
something purely from what we believed in. But to make ends meet, we would go 
outside and do television or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 We formed another group called Brotherhood of Artists that included artists 
from all races. The group protested David Carradine being cast as Kwai Chang 
Caine in the television series "Kung Fu." I remember a television executive 
saying that if they put an Oriental on the tube viewers would turn the 
television off in five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't say there have been significant changes but ever so slightly I see an 
attempt being made. A number of actors who've gone through East-West Players, 
such as John Lone and Pat Morita, have gained stature in the industry, making 
positive contributions through their work. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Carradine is still doing "Kung Fu." And during the past few years 
I've been offered parts, basically a lot of villains. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American actors have no connections with big investors or groups 
concerned with establishing a new image for Asian Americans. In a sense (the 
greater Asian American community) is still divided by being Japanese or Chinese 
or Korean or Vietnamese. We have to go beyond that.

'BUILD FACTORIES, NOT CUTE OFFICES'

 Whenever I visit friends and relatives in Korea, I find myself shopping for 
American-made gifts to take back. My family expects to receive gifts with the 
prestigious "Made in the U.S.A." tag. Yet I can't find many items actually made 
in America in the stores. From toys to electronics to clothes, it seems America 
doesn't make much more than hot dogs and tissue paper. 
</P>
<P>
 America used to be known as a manufacturing powerhouse. That came to mind 
several weeks ago, when I had the chance to ride the Bay Area Rapid Transit 
(BART) while visiting my son at UC Berkeley. I've ridden trams in Germany, 
Japan, Mexico and Korea. But the BART train cars, made by Rohr Industries of 
Chula Vista, were first class. 
</P>
<P>
 The seats weren't luxurious, but simple and functional. The spaces between 
them were just right. I had the same feeling of quality about this BART train 
that I have for a Sony television set or a Lexus automobile. I was impressed at 
the manufacturing capability of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that BART car was built 20 years ago. In the meantime, American 
manufacturers have yielded their reputation to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 It worries me that if Americans do not produce consumer goods locally, in time 
they will forget how to manufacture. The trade deficit is growing through the 
roof. How will Americans get merchandise in coming decades if they don't make 
anything or don't have the money to buy from foreign countries? 
</P>
<P>
 Americans may think that they have strong service industries such as real 
estate, insurance, banking, entertainment and computer software. But if the 
world economy takes a downturn, these are among the first things people stop 
spending money on. 
</P>
<P>
 America must start building strong, efficient factories instead of cute 
offices with up-to-date supplies for white-collar geniuses.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; AN 
INMATE'S ADVICE: 'FOLLOW THROUGH ON '3 STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. ORR, Proposition 184 would reaffirm the three strikes law enacted in 
March that can impose up to a life sentence on repeat offenders. The measure is 
driving fear into the hearts of inmates, says JOHN L. ORR. He knows from 
personal observation: The former Glendale fire captain, who was convicted of 
arson, has been been incarcerated since July, 1992, at the Terminal Island 
Federal Correctional Institution in San Pedro. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who question the viability of "three strikes" laws need only ask the 
opinion of a convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
 I live with more than 1,100 of them. Terminal Island is one of the supposed 
"Club Fed" prisons, beachfront property with tennis courts and a theater. Let 
me reassure you -- prison is no picnic -- not at this or any other institution. 
Violence is only a word, or a glance, away. A seaside view from your dormitory 
or a two-man cell doesn't make doing time any easier. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a former arson investigator and have successfully blended in with the 
general population so can speak as an expert on the subject of cons. I've been 
conning fellow inmates for two years. They don't know my background and have 
willingly shared their pasts with me. All they know is I'm a writer and many 
think their life story would make a great book, so I let them talk. And I 
listen, and I watch. 
</P>
<P>
 I watch them steal from the chow hall, offices, desks, break into vending 
machines and even rip off each other and sometimes, me. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to pride myself on being free from prejudice of any kind. Being forced 
to live with these animals has caused me to be biased about many, even before I 
meet or talk with them. I have found, almost without exception, they have a 
history of, and a propensity toward, trouble, dating back to childhood. They 
laugh about it, they are proud of the number of crimes they have gotten away 
with. Their crimes were a way of life. They have no concern for anyone's 
feelings but their own. There are few exceptions, so I generalize. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical inmate is slovenly, inconsiderate and perceives incarceration as a 
vacation from a life of crime. Three meals a day, clothing and a roof over 
their heads are provided. Jobs paying from $5 to more than $100 a month provide 
sufficient bartering power for cigarettes, snacks or drugs. Those who choose 
not to work, or do only the minimum to get by, will steal or terrorize others 
to obtain what they want. For the vast majority, this lifestyle will not change 
when they are released. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many who eat only once a day to avoid the chow hall lines. Waiting 
in these lines is tense, and close exposure to others is to be avoided. Inmates 
smoke, spit on the ground and floor constantly, cut in line, break wind and 
indiscriminately throw trash down -- and this is just in the chow hall. The 
theater is the same. You cannot escape them.  
</P>
<P>
 There are few opportunities to better yourself in prison. Vocational and 
educational programs seldom fill their classrooms. The average inmate isn't 
interested. However, there is a substantial effort made to force all prisoners 
to obtain at least a GED (high school equivalency degree), but the end result 
is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Our TV rooms are seldom quiet. The cubicles double as game rooms, conference 
chambers, soapboxes and drug stores. The noise is constant, except when "three 
strikes" is discussed on the tube. Jaws drop, eyes focus on the screen and 
Camels burn down to blister fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are scared. Even after the TV segment is over, silence prevails and only 
a few expletives are uttered. I find it reassuring. Maybe there is some light 
at the end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I am middle-aged, I tend to hang out with similar individuals. My 
observations show most criminals start to mellow between 35 and 40 years of 
age. They have learned patience, respect and tend to be motivated to make the 
system work for them upon release. With little or no rehabilitative efforts 
made by institutions, it appears the typical repeat offender finally tires of 
the prison rat race and caves in to conformity. There is a tremendous respect 
for each other among older inmates. Gang affiliations and prejudice fade, and 
even the younger prisoners seem to have respect for these father figures. 
</P>
<P>
 If you make it more uncomfortable for them on the inside, maybe one prison 
stay will be enough for some. If they want to get out, make them earn it by 
good behavior on the inside. I say build more prisons, incarcerate longer. The 
public should not have to tolerate violent, despicable behavior, or any form of 
law-breaker typical of what I see in here every day. Follow through on "three 
strikes." This "captive audience" is paying attention.

BLAZE DESTROYS 9 CONDO STRUCTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A massive fire raged for almost two hours early Sunday at a condominium 
construction site in Lincoln Heights, causing about $6.5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators do not yet know the cause of the fire, which started at 2:09 
a.m. at City View Terrace, a set of 19 buildings at 3711 E. Baldwin St., Los 
Angeles Fire Department spokesman Bob Collis said.The fire swept through nine 
structures, destroying 68 of the site's 106 units. About 150 firefighters and 
two helicopters were called to the scene, Collis said, and the fire was 
extinguished at 3:53 a.m. There were no injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole (complex) was in the framing stage, which makes for a wonderful 
fire," Collis said. "It's like an organized pile of kindling." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire is under investigation.

CLIPPERS WATCHING RISING SON; BASKETBALL: ROOKIE PIATKOWSKI CAN DRAW ON 
FATHER'S EXPERIENCES AS HE MAKES HIS WAY IN NBA.

<P>
 Walt Piatkowski was running late. 
</P>
<P>
 A traveling salesman whose territory covers the Nebraska panhandle, Piatkowski 
had promised his son Eric, a star basketball player at the University of 
Nebraska, he would attend the Cornhusker game against Oklahoma State, but he 
had to drive to a business meeting in North Platte before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulled over by a state trooper on his way to the meeting, Piatkowski expected 
to get a speeding ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you going in such a hurry?" the trooper asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get to my son's ballgame at Nebraska," Piatkowski replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you're Piatkowski's dad," the trooper said. "Here's a warning ticket. 
Good luck to Eric and get on down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the meeting, Piatkowski dumped his notes on the front seat and 
raced to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was stopped again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you going so fast?" the trooper asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get to Nebraska for the game," Piatkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm watching that game, too," the trooper said. "They're playing Oklahoma 
State and Byron Houston. Here's a warning ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Eric Piatkowski has joined the Clippers, Walt Piatkowski would 
probably draw blank stares from California Highway Patrol officers if he 
invoked his son's name to talk his way out of a speeding ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 But if NBA scouts are correct in their assessment of Piatkowski, a 6-foot-8 
swingman who was the 15th player selected in the NBA draft, it won't be long 
before Piatkowski becomes as well known in Los Angeles as he was at Nebraska, 
where he became the first player in school history to score more than 1,000 
points, get more than 600 rebounds and pass for more than 300 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers think Piatkowski has a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love him," forward Loy Vaught said. "I think he's going to be good for this 
team. He has a great outside shot and he's a hard-working guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski was the most valuable player of the 1994 Big Eight tournament, when 
he scored a school-record 43 points against Oklahoma in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the best athletes we've ever had at Nebraska, and in basketball 
he was probably the best," Nebraska Coach Danny Nee said. "He's a very, very 
talented player. We thought we had a real diamond in the rough when he came to 
Nebraska, and I think his best days are ahead of him. I think he can be a hell 
of a player in the NBA. He runs the wing as well as anyone on any level." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he coached Piatkowski for five seasons, Nee jokingly said he still 
doesn't know how to spell his name, which is pronounced Pie-it-KOW-ski. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone pronounces his name wrong," Nee said. "For a while we called him the 
Polish Rifle." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bill Fitch, who coached Larry Bird for four seasons, compared 
Piatkowski to Bird after coaching Piatkowski in last spring's Phoenix Desert 
Classic, a postseason all-star tournament for players in the draft. Piatkowski 
was voted MVP of the tournament after averaging 22 points and shooting 63%. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a lot of Bird's mannerisms," Fitch said. "To compare anybody's game 
to Bird is an injustice to the person that you do it to. I didn't mean to put a 
label on him that way. But he's got a lot of Bird's qualities to practice and 
work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski was flattered by the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably said that thinking he was never going to coach me again," 
Piatkowski said. "It was awfully nice of him to say that, and I hope I can live 
up to his expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch hasn't changed his mind since Piatkowski joined the team, ending a 
weeklong holdout on Oct. 14 by signing a five-year contract reportedly worth $6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shows the tools that I saw at the Phoenix camp and that we saw in school," 
Fitch said. "He's got a great stroke, he's a smart kid, and he plays hard while 
he's out there. He can do nothing but get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski learned his work ethic from his father, a 6-8 forward who played 
for Fitch at Bowling Green. After graduating in 1968, the elder Piatkowski 
spent 2 1/2 seasons in the American Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was really young, people would ask me, 'Are you going to be a pro 
basketball player like your dad was?' " Piatkowski said. "At that age you could 
really care less. I really liked the fact that he never pushed me at all. He 
just let me do my own thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw my dad play in the ABA because I wasn't born yet. But when I was 
in second or third grade, he still played a lot of basketball for a town 
basketball team that went to other towns for tournaments. I remember that I'd 
beg him to let me go along. And if for some reason I couldn't go, I'd be 
crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch said Eric got his shooting touch from his father, who led the 
Mid-American Conference in scoring as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lot better shooter than Eric," Fitch said. "He was a shooter and a 
competitor. I think Eric got a lot of that from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "His thing in the ABA was that he was a 6-8 guy who could shoot three-pointers 
like they were going out of style. I guess you could say he was a small forward 
in the body of a power forward. Eric's got the stroke, but like I told him the 
other day, he could be a great shooter and still be the second best in his 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch put the elder Piatkowski, who had bulked up from 215 to 270 pounds after 
drinking beer with his friends on the football team, on a rigorous conditioning 
program before his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lot like (Clipper center) Stanley (Roberts) when I met him," Fitch 
said. "I remember the first time I met him I told him that he'd better grow 
eight inches or lose 50 pounds. He had a weight problem and he lost it. I 
remember (after he lost weight) all his shirts fit him like a turtle." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Piatkowski, 49, said Fitch was hard on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put a rubber suit on me and I had to run the stadium steps with a weighted 
vest," he recalled. "In a three-month period of time I went down to 215. He 
just melted the weight off me and made me a good player. I didn't have the 
jumping ability or the speed that Eric has, but I shot the ball awfully well." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric got advice from his father about this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Eric that he'd better be in shape to play for Fitch," Walt Piatkowski 
said. "(Fitch) worked us like you wouldn't believe. He ran us with the 
cross-country team on Saturdays. You work awfully hard in Bill Fitch's camps. 
If you don't work hard, you don't last." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski will earn more in his first month in the NBA than his father did 
during his entire pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Piatkowski signed a two-year, no-cut contract for $30,000 a season 
with a $10,000 bonus with the Denver Rockets 10 days before the 1968 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it for security reasons," he said. "I was married and had a child, so I 
went with the Rockets." 
</P>
<P>
 After making the ABA all-rookie team, Piatkowski didn't play much in his 
second season after the team signed Spencer Haywood. Traded to Kentucky in 
1970, he retired and taught school for a year after his salary was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 But he returned to the ABA in 1971, signing with the Miami Floridians. 
However, he was cut a month into the season after leaving the team for three 
days to attend the funeral of his father-in-law before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob Bass was the coach and I asked him if he was going to cut me and he said 
that he never cut anyone who was going home for a funeral," Piatkowski said. "I 
left my car at the Miami airport and flew home for the funeral. When I got back 
to the Miami airport, I picked up the Miami Herald and it said, 'Piatkowski put 
on waivers.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always told Eric that story. It's not me being nasty or doom-and-gloom, 
but I want him to know it's a business. There is a down side, and Eric knows 
that. I've tried to instill that in all my sons." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who had been hired to coach the Cleveland Cavaliers, asked Piatkowski 
if he wanted to try out for the Cavaliers, but the incident in Miami soured him 
on pro basketball. He moved to Denver, taking a job as a salesman for a paper 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just took the heart out of me," he said. "It took a while for me just to 
go back and watch the game. But it all worked out. I've always said to people, 
'Never look back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski's four sons inherited their father's basketball ability. David, 27, 
now a high school teacher, was a 6-4 guard who played at Hastings (Neb.) 
College. Sean, 19, a 6-4 guard who was the runner-up for South Dakota's Mr. 
Basketball award in 1993, is a sophomore at Bakersfield College. Troy, 17, is a 
6-5 senior guard and pitcher at Rapid City Stevens High. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eric, 24, is perhaps the best athlete in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought he had a shot at the pros and I wanted to give him as much 
experience as possible because I thought Eric was special," Walt Piatkowski 
said. "It's not only his shooting ability; he understands the game. But the 
biggest thing about Eric is that he's not selfish." 
</P>
<P>
 A prep All-American who was voted South Dakota's Mr. Basketball in 1989 after 
averaging 25.6 points, 10.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and leading Stevens High to 
the state title, Piatkowski turned down offers from Indiana and Notre Dame to 
sign with Nebraska because he wanted to remain close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 After averaging 13.8 points in his first three seasons at Nebraska, Piatkowski 
blossomed as a senior, averaging a team-high 21.5 points and 6.3 rebounds in 
leading the Cornhuskers to the Big Eight title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski's stock rose after he played well at the NBA tryout camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really scared going into camps," Piatkowski said. "The way I looked at 
it was that (the camps) had a lot to do with your entire life. It was going to 
determine where you lived and how much money you were making. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the season was over, guys wanted to go out and party, but I 
started working out twice as hard as I did in the regular season because I 
wanted to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally drafted by the Indiana Pacers, he was traded to the Clippers the 
day after the draft with guard Pooh Richardson and forward Malik Sealy for 
point guard Mark Jackson and the draft rights to Louisville guard Greg Minor, 
the 25th player selected. 
</P>
<P>
 A celebrity in Lincoln, Neb., Piatkowski likes the fact that he's nearly 
anonymous in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of neat right now that nobody has a clue who I am. At Nebraska, I'd 
be trying to eat dinner in a nice restaurant and 50 people would come up to me 
and ask for my autograph." 
</P>
<P>
 But that could change, if Piatkowski meets the expectations the Clippers have 
for him.

MIKE DOWNEY: SPINE-TINGLING ENDING FITTING FOR HORROR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The clock went 0:05, 0:04, 0:03, 0:02 with the football floating in mid-air. 
Cheerleaders dressed as harlequins, harem girls, Elvira and Catwoman followed 
the football with their eyes, some through Halloween masks. The ball plopped 
against the crossbar at 0:01 and flopped backward at 0:00. The Raiders got 
treated. The Oilers got tricked. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's kicker, Al Del Greco, missed a 52-yard field goal because he kicked 
the ball 51 yards, 6 inches. Houston's quarterback, Billy Joe Tolliver, sagged 
to his knees on the sideline in distress. Houston's even sadder coach, It's 
Jack Pardee And He'll Cry If He Wants To, stood there like he had just seen a 
ghost. The Oilers had just lost to the Raiders, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 You want sadness? Here's sadness: 
</P>
<P>
 "Same book, different chapter," Pardee said, oh so sorrowfully. 
</P>
<P>
 You want relief? Here's relief: 
</P>
<P>
 "Adversity can be ugly as mud," Raider tackle Jerry Ball said, 
philosophically. "What you got to do is take mud and make it taste like sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 You want confidence? Here's confidence: 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't matter to me if he made that kick or not," Raider guard Kevin Gogan 
said, strangely, since the kick would have tied the score. "We would have just 
driven the other way for a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 But, uh, Kevin? The clock read 0:00. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence, baby," Gogan said, grinning. "Confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the way, this was one witch-ugly football game. The ball squirted from 
players' fingers like a greased pigskin and the Raider and Oiler offenses were 
a disgrace to their American Football Conference ancestors. Until the wild 
ending, this was a game NBC-TV should have yanked off the air to show "Heidi." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers actually did leave. Hundreds headed for the exits after Houston 
scored a touchdown with 3:19 remaining, as though the actual time remaining was 
more like 0:19. Many frankly doubted that the Raiders had a touchdown left in 
them. The way Harvey Williams and Jeff Hostetler had handled the ball all 
afternoon, it was obvious that their favorite Halloween candy must be 
Butterfingers. 
</P>
<P>
 You want guilt? Here's guilt: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like our offense did everything in its power to lose the game," said 
Raider receiver Tim Brown, himself a part of that offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Weird and spooky things kept happening. Mike Jones did a swoop-and-scoop of a 
loose ball in an attempt to pull off a miracle run a la Robert Bailey, but 
nearly pulled a Leon Lett no-no instead. Dan Land dropped a potential 
interception that couldn't have been delivered into his hands more safely had 
it been brought by Federal Express. And unlucky Robert Jenkins got caught 
holding on back-to-back long gainers, until even a 28-yarder by Williams wasn't 
enough for a first down because the Raiders were penalized halfway to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were in danger of a 3-5 record and a long, long, long, long 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet somehow by the time the fourth quarter crawled to the two-minute warning, 
the Raiders found themselves only 11 yards from a big, big, big, big touchdown. 
Their bacon had been saved more than once by the defense, specifically by 
Chester McGlockton and Nolan Harrison playing patty-cake until they decided 
which one would cause the fumble and which one would recover it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the hookup of Hostetler to Williams got its act together. And Hoss found 
Brown, who tip-toed out at the 11. And into the game ran a big old tight end, 
6-foot-4, 245-pound Jamie Williams, to line up just in front of another big 
tight end, 6-6, 245-pound Andrew Glover, for a play called as a pass, not a 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oilers came with a nine-man, kill-or-be-killed blitz. And Hostetler 
noticed, just in time. The quarterback called an audible, the way quarterbacks 
are supposed to do when they see something they don't like. He found Brown for 
an 11-yard touchdown, and when Brown came down, he fell into the arms of a 
great big bearhug by great big Jamie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 That was that, except for Del Greco's 51 1/2-yard boot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said 51, ain't but a few players can make that," the Raiders' Anthony Smith 
said. "I said no way." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown said the same. He said, "No way this guy will make this field goal, 
52 yards, on the grass, especially since he's a (Astro) turf kicker. I said, 
'It's out of his range.' And then I said, 'No, it's IN his range!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty scary there, for a second.

RAIDERS LEAVE OILERS WITH CROSS TO BEAR; PRO FOOTBALL: DEL GRECO'S 52-YARD 
FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT ON THE LAST PLAY OF THE GAME HITS BAR AS L.A. ESCAPES, 
17-14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As it made its way on its crucial journey toward the peristyle end of the 
Coliseum late Sunday afternoon, the ball off the toe of Houston Oiler kicker Al 
Del Greco seemed to hang forever. 
</P>
<P>
 And with it, perhaps, hung the Raiders' season. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Greco's 52-yard field-goal attempt on the game's final play was straight 
enough. But it wasn't long enough and the Raiders escaped with a 17-14 victory 
before 40,473. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the kick been good, the game would have gone into overtime. Because it 
missed, the Raiders gained a victory that evened their record at 4-4 and put 
them in contention for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Raider defensive lineman Nolan Harrison turned to watch the ball 
with an overwhelming sense of helplessness. On the sidelines, receiver Tim 
Brown and offensive lineman Kevin Gogan debated the strength of the soaring 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's out of his range." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's in his range." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Tom Rathman couldn't watch. He turned and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball landed squarely on the crossbar, bounced up for another agonizing 
moment, then bounced backward. 
</P>
<P>
 No good. 
</P>
<P>
 It was close enough that quarterback Jeff Hostetler had to throw to Brown for 
an 11-yard touchdown pass with 1:50 left to push the Raiders into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But it never should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Not against an Oiler team that had lost six of seven, led the league in 
turnovers, had scored three touchdowns in the first three quarters all season 
and started backup quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver over injured, inconsistent 
Cody Carlson, the man who was supposed to replace Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders did their best to keep the Oilers in the game. They fumbled 
four times, losing two of those. Hostetler had two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 And a defense that has played brilliantly at times this season continued to 
show an alarming inability to put opponents away at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense was unable to stop Tolliver from driving 86 yards in the 
fourth quarter for the touchdown that briefly put Houston ahead. The touchdown 
came on a seven-yard pass from Tolliver to Haywood Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor could the defense prevent Tolliver from driving 50 yards in the closing 
minute to put Del Greco in position for his final kick. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raider defense, led by Chester McGlockton, also did enough things 
right to ensure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't allow Houston to drive a 51st yard at the end, which would have been 
enough to allow Del Greco's kick to squeak through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders forced three Houston fumbles and recorded three sacks. McGlockton 
forced two of the fumbles and recovered one, recorded two of the sacks and 
accounted for seven tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Raider offense might have sputtered and labored on drive after drive 
Sunday, tailback Harvey Williams had no such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second week in a row, he started and responded, gaining a career-high 
128 yards rushing on 29 carries and 38 more yards on four receptions. It was 
Williams' second consecutive 100-yard plus effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams scored the first Raider touchdown on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 But the score was tied by the half when Tolliver ended the second quarter by 
driving to the Raider six-yard line and scoring himself from there, diving into 
the end zone after eluding a tackle by Lionel Washington at the three-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders took advantage of a Houston turnover in the third quarter to 
regain the lead. McGlockton knocked the ball out of Tolliver's hands, Harrison 
recovering it. 
</P>
<P>
 That enabled Jeff Jaeger to kick a 35-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the next drive, the Raiders repeated their act. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton swatted the ball from Tolliver again, and Harrison got it. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, from the Oiler four-yard line, the Raiders couldn't hold on 
either. Williams fumbled and Houston recovered on the first play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those days. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it came down to a Raider offense that had one drive left in it at 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing the offense did it," Brown said. "We did everything in our 
power to lose the game. I'm happy it was the offense that did it in the end, 
because it may have been detrimental to our season if it had not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler drove from the Raider 33 to the Houston 11. 
</P>
<P>
 A run was called from there, but, seeing the Oilers poised to blitz, Hostetler 
changed the play. 
</P>
<P>
 At the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't change it in the huddle," he said with a big grin on his face, 
referring to the play-calling controversy in recent weeks. "I know better than 
that. Don't get me in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was in trouble when the ball was snapped. The Oilers poured in and 
he headed for the right sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was desperately looking for his favorite target. Brown had made it 
to the right corner of the end zone, and had started to cut back. Hostetler 
spotted him, and threw the ball back across his body and high, beyond the reach 
of defensive backs Darryll Lewis and Cris Dishman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to put some air under it," Hostetler said. "I just wanted to get it 
in Tim's hands. Once there, it's pretty safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown caught it at the back of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Hostetler keep finding Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. "I think it's the beeper I gave him." 
</P>
<P>
 It took a while Sunday, but the Raiders finally got their signals straight. 
Raiders Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Eddie Anderson, bothered by a groin pull, sat out Sunday's game, and 
was replaced by Patrick Bates, who had to leave the game in the fourth quarter 
because of a deep shoulder bruise.

PRUDHOMME LEFT AT THE LINE; DRAG RACING: VETERAN DRIVER'S CAREER ENDS IN 
SUNDAY'S FIRST ROUND. IN TOP FUEL, KENNY BERNSTEIN RUNS THE FASTEST 
QUARTER-MILE IN HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Snake's Final Strike came early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same Pomona Fairplex drag strip where his National Hot Rod Assn. career 
began in 1965, Don Prudhomme's career came to a close when his tires smoked off 
the line in the first round of the 30th Winston Select Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The record books will show that rookie Bob Vandergriff Jr. of Alpharetta, Ga., 
who was born Feb. 7, 1965 -- the day Prudhomme won his first race in 1965 -- 
captured the first-round match with a 4.97-second run at 296.44 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudhomme, his tires smoking as the top fuel dragster lost traction with the 
first punch of the throttle, coasted most of the 1,320-foot track and finished 
in 9.987 seconds at a freeway speed of 76.37 m.p.h. in his last race before 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's happened to me before, so I'm not surprised," an emotional Prudhomme 
said. "Disappointing, but not surprising. It's an up-and-down sport and no 
matter how good you're running, you're going to have rounds like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The final rounds did not disappoint the crowd, which stayed into the darkness 
for the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Bernstein, 50, who made the switch from funny cars to top fuel dragsters 
with Prudhomme in 1990, ran 314.46 m.p.h., the fastest quarter-mile in drag 
racing history, to defeat Cory McClenathan in the top fuel final. Earlier, he 
had posted a record 311.85 in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a 28-event losing streak for Bernstein, dating to May 1993. 
He earned $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-time funny car champion John Force also set an NHRA speed record with a 
303.95 m.p.h. run to defeat former champion Cruz Pedregon in the final. Like 
Bernstein, he had set a record in the semifinals of 303.74. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their nightmares are just beginning," Force shouted after his victory, giving 
warning that he will return next year with a new Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
 The two finals were a bittersweet ending for the Larry Minor nitro team. 
McClenathan and Pedregon are his drivers, but next year McDonald's is moving 
its sponsorship to the newly formed team headed by former NFL coach Joe Gibbs. 
McClenathan and Pedregon are both joining Gibbs, leaving Minor with two of the 
strongest cars in drag racing -- and no drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back next year, one way or the other," said Minor, the potato magnate 
from San Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence next to the starting pad was crowded with drivers and crews from 
other teams when Prudhomme staged for the first race of his final day. When it 
was over and the Snake's car was being towed back its last quarter mile, the 
crowd of about 45,000 was on its feet cheering and waving caps to the drag 
racing legend from Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudhomme's problem off the line might have started when Bernstein laid down a 
long line of oil on the left lane when his engine gave out while beating Jim 
Head. Bernstein burned a couple of pistons and spewed most of his 12 gallons of 
oil on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prudhomme-Vandergriff match was delayed 30 minutes while crews cleaned the 
track. Bernstein's crew, headed by Dale Armstrong, changed engines during the 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wait wouldn't have bothered me so much, but I knew the track was changing 
out there," Prudhomme said. "I wasn't that good off the line, but I knew I had 
a heck of a hod rod under me. The track was a little different and we had the 
engine (tuned up) a little stout and spun the tires. Sometimes the car has a 
mind of its own." 
</P>
<P>
 Prudhomme was the only driver in eight first-round matches to lose in the left 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, it's a bit of a relief for me that it's over," he 
said. "It (the yearlong Final Strike Tour) has worn me out. I wouldn't have 
changed a thing, but it was tiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tear or two in my eyes, but I'm already looking forward to my new 
life as a car owner." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Prudhomme will campaign his own top fuel dragster, which will be 
driven by rookie Larry Dixon Jr. He will have the same crew, headed by Wes 
Cerny, that helped him to a second-place finish behind Scott Kalitta in the 
1994 top fuel standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly Anderson, the No. 1 qualifier who won $50,000 in the Budweiser Classic 
on Saturday, lost in the second round to Mike Dunn, but it was still a 
memorable day for the Cal State Fullerton graduate. Her brother, Randy, won the 
top alcohol funny car final and his second Winston championship and her fiance, 
Jay Payne, defeated former Southern California junior tennis star Randy Parks 
in the top alcohol dragster final. 
</P>
<P>
 She also collected $50,000 from the Slick 50 World Record Club when no one 
bettered her NHRA record of 4.718 seconds set on Saturday. Bernstein came close 
with his final round 4.720, but didn't quite take the bonus from her. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Alderman, after clinching his third Winston pro stock championship in 
a battle with Wayne County Dodge teammate Scott Geoffrion by reaching the 
semifinals, came back to beat Geoffrion in the final, 7.09 to 7.10. John Myers 
won the pro motorcycle final against Jim Bernard.

NEBRASKA POLL VAULTS PENN STATE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CORNHUSKERS' BIG VICTORY 
OVER COLORADO LEADS TO CHANGE. COACHES KEEP NITTANY LIONS FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As hard-sell campaigning goes, Nebraska offensive tackle Zach Wiegert might 
want to think twice about a career in politics. Asked Saturday if he thought 
the unbeaten Cornhuskers deserved to be ranked No. 1 in the polls, Wiegert 
showed remarkable restraint for a player whose team had humiliated 
second-ranked Colorado, 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope all the voters watched the game, that's all I'm going to say," 
said Wiegert, who then declined to speculate about the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess what? Someone watched. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another ballot flip-flop, the Associated Press voters bumped Penn State 
(7-0) from the top spot and moved Nebraska (9-0) there from the No. 3 position. 
As it turns out, enough of the 62 writers and broadcasters who vote thought 
more of the Cornhuskers' victory than the Nittany Lions' 63-14 rout of then-No. 
21 Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 The upper reaches of the USA Today/CNN coaches poll remained the same, by the 
slimmest of margins. For the third consecutive week, Penn State (32 first-place 
votes, 1,520 points) stayed at No. 1, followed by Nebraska (30/1,518). 
</P>
<P>
 The AP poll was hardly a mandate either. Nebraska received 33 first-place 
votes and 1,520 points. Penn State had 28 first-place votes and 1,514 points. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nebraska and Penn State remain unbeaten, the Cornhuskers would return to 
the Orange Bowl and most likely play Miami on Jan. 2, whereas the Nittany Lions 
would travel to Pasadena for a Jan. 2 appearance against the Pacific 10 
Conference champion. At the moment, Oregon, Washington State, Arizona and USC 
are tied for the lead in the Rose Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowl victories by both Nebraska and Penn State might result in yet another 
split national championship, which would be the third since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, neither Cornhusker Coach Tom Osborne nor Nittany Lion Coach 
Joe Paterno are pleading their cases. If anything, they say they couldn't care 
less about the polls. . . . now. Come Jan. 3, when the final results are 
released, they will care. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big step," Osborne said after the Colorado victory. "We've got a 
chance to get something done." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne was talking about an Orange Bowl trip, not the weekly rankings. Ask 
him about the polls and he grimaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno was no different after the victory against Ohio State. He said he 
didn't hear Osborne pushing for No. 1, so why should he? Anyway, he said, there 
were too many games left to worry about rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne and Paterno don't need to campaign; Colorado and Ohio State will do it 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Coach Bill McCartney, who said his team was whipped pure and simple, 
cast his vote for Nebraska. Colorado never had a chance, a theme echoed by Buff 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing I can say," tight end Christian Fauria said. "We played 
horrible and they played great. Right now, there's not much we can do. We just 
have to give credit to Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
 And there is little doubt whom Buckeye Coach John Cooper chose as No. 1. After 
watching Penn State score 63 points -- the first time that has happened to a 
Buckeye team since 1902 -- Cooper was in awe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they're as good as I think they are -- and I think they are," he said. 
"I knew going into the ballgame they were a great offensive team. They may be 
the best offensive team I've seen since I've been in coaching. We couldn't stop 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State, in only its second season in the Big Ten, has won 12 consecutive 
games, the nation's second-longest winning streak. And not since 1985, when 
Iowa was unbeaten after seven games, has a Big Ten team been ranked No. 1 this 
late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the AP top 10 were Auburn, which earned one first-place vote, 
followed by Florida, Miami, Alabama, Colorado, Florida State, Utah and 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 was well represented in the bottom half of the top 25. Washington 
was No. 12, Washington State No. 16, Arizona No. 18, Oregon No. 21 and USC No. 
23.

MIKE PENNER: GILBERT CUT OUT FOR JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here, in a place called Stan Diego, there is no such thing as quarterback 
controversy, only quarterback consternation. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, it's the same angst, the same query, only with occasional 
variations on the theme. 
</P>
<P>
 How's Stan's: a) hip? b) knee? c) ankle? d) head? e) shoulders? f) all of the 
above? g) whatever it is we didn't think of but need to immediately start 
fretting about?  
</P>
<P>
 Keeping track of Stan Humphries is a bit like keeping track of Chris Miller, 
in that you can usually find both getting wrapped in the trainer's room. The 
difference is that Humphries' welfare directly affects that of the Chargers. 
Last week, Humphries wrenched his ankle, missed one series and the Chargers 
lost for the first time this season. With the Rams, Miller or Chris Chandler -- 
it really doesn't matter who gets to hand off the ball to Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Humphries fell on his left elbow early in the third quarter Sunday and 
had to be escorted off the field, the electricity in the air at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium was instantly replaced with high anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stands and in the Chargers' offensive huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Stan went down, I said to myself, 'This is it,' " tailback Natrone Means 
said. " 'This is going to show us what kind of character we have.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gale Gilbert, in other words. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of character spends nine seasons as an NFL quarterback without 
throwing a pass in five of them? Who goes three years between center snaps? Who 
is so fastidious about career details that he arranges them neatly in election 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 Last touchdown pass? 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Last appearance in back-to-back games? 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Last significant role in a winning effort? 1984, when Gilbert was a senior at 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 We go to the polls again Tuesday, so Gilbert was due. He hadn't done much in 
1994 except fail to bail the Chargers out last Sunday against Denver, misfire 
on four of six pass attempts and leave unsightly rust stains on the football. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday against Seattle, Gilbert tried it again, this time getting nearly two 
quarters in. This virtually doubled his total playing time for the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw 14 passes, improving his post-1986 total to 25. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 11. Post-'86 total: now 21. 
</P>
<P>
 He managed two touchdown passes even, jumping his career total a full 33%, 
from six to a hearty eight. 
</P>
<P>
 And he won. 
</P>
<P>
 Not mop up, not run out the clock, not hold for the clinching field goal, not 
take two snaps and plant the right knee on the turf twice. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12:46 remaining in the third quarter of a 14-7 game, Gilbert had to 
produce. This was no time to pitch the ball to Means, backpedal out of the way 
and sit on a seven-point lead. Not with Rick Mirer, Chris Warren and Brian 
Blades still on the Seahawks' active list. There was too much time for that. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bobby Ross sent Gilbert in there, but just in case, he made sure the 
trainers taped up Humphries' left elbow good and fast. It's dislocated, sure, 
but Stan only needs the right one to throw, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have come back and played," Ross said of Humphries, "but it would 
have been limited. We just didn't feel like it was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert saw to that, which is top-of-the-page news in San Diego. Gilbert came 
right in and drove the Chargers to a touchdown on his first series. Granted, 
San Diego got the ball on the Seattle 37, and Means got 27 of the yards 
himself, but Gilbert had succeeded at least in not getting electrocuted while 
getting his feet wet. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fourth-quarter touchdown passes followed, to Alfred Pupunu for eight yards 
and to Tony Martin for 16, and the Chargers were on their way to a 35-15 
victory, feeling slightly better about their chances if Gilbert has to start 
next week's game against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the reporters around Gilbert treated the victorious quarterback as 
if he were an amnesia sufferer? 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you remember your last touchdown pass?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Gilbert did. "1990, against the Redskins," he reported. Gilbert was a 
Buffalo Bill then and "we had just clinched the home-field advantage. It was 
the last game of the season, so Frank (Reich) and I played a half each. I threw 
a couple of 'em in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 "When was the last time you played this long in a game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert: "1986. I started two games against the Chiefs and the Jets. In eight 
years, I played two full games." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you win either of them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert: "No. We got killed in both." 
</P>
<P>
 "So when was the last game you started and won?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert had to think that one over a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to have been 1984, in college," he said. "A bad year too. A real bad 
year. I had everything going for me -- there was some talk about me going in 
the first round of the draft -- and I tore ligaments in my knee. The team ended 
up 2-9, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert wound up signing with Seattle as a free agent in 1985, re-injuring his 
knee in 1987, missing all of 1988 and bouncing to Buffalo in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually won the backup job there," Gilbert said, "and during the last game 
of the preseason, I broke some ribs. They brought Frank Reich back, he came in 
and pulled three games out for them that season and the rest is history." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert's signing with San Diego last winter was for reasons more financial 
than providential. The Chargers simply didn't want to pay John Freisz. So they 
reached into the bargain bin, took a flier on Gilbert -- and prayed for 
Humphries' good health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent five years in Buffalo and went to four straight Super Bowls," Gilbert 
said. "But the main thing in this game is to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert has ridden coattails much too long. For once in his career, he'd like 
to be the one wearing the coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he tried it on for size. The fit and the cut were just about right.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT GET YOU DOWN

<P>
 While San Francisco 49er Coach George Seifert tries to get his team to the 
Super Bowl, his wife, Linda, 50, achieves loftier goals. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently scaled 19,340-foot Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa. Her other conquests 
include Mt. Whitney, 14,495 feet; Japan's Mt. Fuji, 12,388 feet, and Yosemite's 
Half Dome, which she has climbed many times. 
</P>
<P>
 John Crumpacker of the San Francisco Examiner reported that Linda made the 
Kilimanjaro ascent without so much as a blister. However, when she came home to 
Los Altos she "promptly bashed her toe on the brick step in the back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: When did Oregon first play in the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodating: In a book "A Kind of Grace" on women sportswriters, editor Ron 
Rapoport of the Daily News recalled the time Lesley Visser, writing for the 
Boston Globe, stood outside a dressing room waiting to interview quarterback 
Terry Bradshaw of the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he finally emerged and saw her holding a notebook, Bradshaw did the 
natural thing: He took it from her and signed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Please, hurry up: Mike Flanagan, new pitching coach for the Baltimore Orioles, 
describing one of his former pitching coaches, Toronto's Al Widmar:  
</P>
<P>
 "It took him so long to get to the mound that when he asked me how I was 
doing, I would tell him, 'I was doing fine when you started coming out here, 
but I got tired waiting for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gangway: John Steigerald in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "It's nice that the 
NBA has decided to enforce the rules against hand checking. Now it would be 
nice if they enforced some of the more fundamental rules, like traveling and 
palming the ball. If they're going to let players cradle the ball like a 
football and charge the hoop, defenders should be allowed to tackle them." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison: Tom Weir in USA Today: "A lot of people say Grant Hill is the next 
Michael Jordan, but I dunno. To me, Hill looks more like a first baseman than 
an outfielder." 
</P>
<P>
 Big East Trojans?ESPN's Beano Cook said Saturday that No. 1 ranked Penn State 
has benefited from an "easy non-conference schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, USC would fall in that category along with Rutgers and Temple, having 
lost to Penn State, 38-14, on Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or . . .: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News: "You think 
times have changed? In 1925, Babe Ruth's basic salary was $52,000, matched in 
sports only by that of Grantland Rice, the sportswriter.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's right, the sportswriter!"

 Looking back: On this day in 1987 jockey Chris Antley became the first rider

GOLF ROUNDUP; MURPHY'S AIM STAYS TRUE FOR SENIOR PGA VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is any golfer hotter than Bob Murphy? 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy won his second Senior PGA Tour title in three weeks Sunday, matching 
the tournament record in capturing the $550,000 Kaanapali Seniors Classic by 
two strokes in Kaanapali, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the 54 holes with a five-under-par 66 and a three-day total of 
195. Jim Colbert had a 195 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty good week," Murphy said. "I hate to say this because I don't 
want people to take it the wrong way, but I won in Sacramento and played well 
in Los Angeles so I came in here with confidence. When the wind died, it played 
into my game." 
</P>
<P>
 In his last 10 rounds of golf, Murphy has played nine-under 70. In the two 
tournaments before the Kaanapali, he finished first and tied for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kiefer made a challenge by shooting a 30 on the front nine Sunday, but 
Murphy took the lead for good when Kiefer bogeyed the 10th and Murphy birdied 
the 11th. No one got within two strokes after that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhard Langer of Germany shot a one-under 70 to win the Volvo Masters at 
Sotogrande, Spain, by one shot when Seve Ballesteros bogeyed the final hole. 
Langer, who earned $204,000, finished with an eight-under 276. The victory 
helped him pass Spain's Ballesteros and move into second place on the final 
European money list -- worth a bonus of $135,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballesteros, with a 73, finished in a second-place tie with Vijay Singh of 
Fiji at 277. Singh's 66 was the day's low score. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle McGann and Donna Andrews each shot 66 as the United States won 11 of 
18 individual matches against Japan to win the Nichirei International LPGA 
event in Ami, Japan, for the 10th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 The final score was 22 1/2-13 1/2. The Americans led, 10 1/2-7 1/2, after the 
first two rounds -- all pairs matches.

 They played down to the level of their competition, which is about as low as 
there is in the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was a mess of a game marred by numerous penalties, turnovers and missed 
opportunities and saved only by a furious finish. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had long touchdown drives on their first and last possessions, but 
did practically nothing with the football in between. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler was on target during the winning drive, but something less than 
mediocre most of the afternoon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He reminded me of, say, Jay Schroeder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams rushed for more than 100 yards for the second time in a row, 
but was guilty of a key fumble. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, sparked by the sack-and-recover-the-fumble team of Chester 
McGlockton and Nolan Harrison, made some big plays, but the Oilers scored a 
point more than usual. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop: Kansas City, where the Raiders haven't won since 1988. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Arrowhead Stadium will be packed with about 78,000 fans Sunday night, in 
contrast to the 40,473 the Raiders and Oilers drew at the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The only sport that has attracted a capacity crowd to a football stadium 
around here this year is soccer. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Penn State is still the best college football team in the nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions' 63-14 victory over Ohio State didn't change my mind. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State has a better chance than Nebraska of staying unbeaten. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But Nebraska has a better chance than Penn State to win an undisputed national 
title if both stay unbeaten. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers figure to play Miami or Florida State in the Orange Bowl while 
the Nittany Lions probably will be matched against one of four teams currently 
not in the Top 10 -- Oregon, USC, Arizona or Washington State -- in the Rose 
Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Nebraska will get the last good shot to impress voters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with ESPN commentator Beano Cook that Penn State quarterback Kerry 
Collins is the most deserving Heisman Trophy candidate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, I'm not as sure as Cook that Collins is going to win it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, who completed 19 of 23 passes for 265 yards and two touchdowns 
against Ohio State, is on a pace to set a single-season NCAA pass efficiency 
record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Collins and running back Ki-Jana Carter might split the 
votes of those choosing a Penn State player. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The week's most untimely feature was ABC's halftime segment on Colorado 
quarterback Kordell Stewart and assistant coach Rick Neuheisel, shown while the 
Buffaloes were trailing Nebraska, 17-0. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Osborne outcoached Bill McCartney. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The underrated Osborne does that to many people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska -- which could fill its stadium for a game against Middle Tennessee 
State, and did two years ago -- is wise to play a relatively easy 
non-conference schedule. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So is Penn State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado and Michigan, which play tough schedules, appear to be worn out. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Florida Coach Steve Spurrier won't win any popularity contests among his peers 
in the Southeastern Conference, especially after calling pass plays and a 
reverse late in the fourth quarter while the Gators were leading Georgia, 
52-14. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 J.J. Stokes does make a difference for UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had a go-to guy on the two-point conversion that gave them a 31-30 
win over Stanford at the Rose Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The most exciting UCLA game of the season was the only one that hasn't been 
televised. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Where would Stanford, 2-5-1, be without Steve Stenstrom? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon, which has upset Washington and Arizona the last two weeks, still can't 
take a deep breath. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Next for the Ducks is Arizona State, coming off an upset victory at Brigham 
Young. Then come road games against dangerous Stanford and traditional rival 
Oregon State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference preseason sportswriters' poll had Oregon eighth and 
Washington State 10th.

PRO FOOTBALL SPOTLIGHT; WHERE DID THIS GUY BLAKE COME FROM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pro Football Spotlight compiled by Bob Cuomo, Houston Mitchell, Ara Najarian 
and Larry Stewart.

<P>
 It's not as if Jeff Blake came out of nowhere. He was a college quarterback of 
some note at East Carolina in 1991. It's that he all but disappeared after 
that, only to resurface in a big way Sunday when he nearly led the Cincinnati 
Bengals to an upset victory over the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake is from Sanford, Fla., where his high school coach was his father, 
Emory. His godfather is baseball's Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
 At East Carolina, Blake set all kinds of school records in leading the Pirates 
to an 11-1 season in '91, and he finished ninth in the Heisman balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was a sixth-round draft pick of the New York Jets. He made the team and 
played in three games, completing four of nine passes for 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the 1993 season on the inactive list, and was cut by the Jets before 
the season and ended up as the Bengals' No. 3 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He started Sunday because of injuries to David Klingler and Don Hollas, and 
all he did was complete 14 of 32 passes for 247 yards and shake up the Cowboys 
with two long touchdown passes to Darnay Scott, the rookie from San Diego 
State, to put the Bengals on top, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying not to let my head get too big, because I know where I came from," 
Blake said. "I know how hard I had to work to get here. The situation I'm in 
now people dream of being in. I'm just grateful for it." GIANTS DO SOME REFEREE 
BASHING 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Giants were victimized by three controversial calls in their 
28-25 overtime loss to the Lions, and all three led to Detroit scores. They 
were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Willie Beamon was called for pass interference late in the first half even 
though he appeared to make a good play on Herman Moore. Two plays later, Moore 
caught a 14-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On a one-yard touchdown pass on third and goal from Scott Mitchell to Moore 
that put Detroit ahead, 25-18, with 8:48 to play, side judge Don Wedge 
emphatically ruled Moore never had possession of the ball, but Wedge was 
overruled and the score was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The field judge and head linesman both came down and told the side judge that 
they had (seen) two feet clearly down with possession of the ball," referee 
Gary Lane said. "And when the man started to go down is when he lost the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Corey Raymond, who was covering Moore, said: "I can't believe they 
changed it. They get into their little huddle and looked up at the board. It 
was a terrible call. Every week we are getting the short end of the stick." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most blatant error came in overtime on first and 10 from the New York 
36 when Mitchell threw Moore a short pass and Giant safety Jarvis Williams 
slammed into him, knocking the Lion receiver to a knee at the 33. Replays 
clearly showed his knee down. However, the officials didn't blow the play dead 
and Moore got up and made it to the seven before being tackled. Two plays 
later, Jason Hanson kicked a game-winning, 24-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Snapped Giant linebacker Corey Miller: "Obviously, his knee was down. What I 
want to say about these guys (the officials) I can't say." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Giant tackle Erik Howard: "You're not supposed to worry about 
officiating, but too much stuff has happened to us over the last five weeks." 
DILFER A DUD SO FAR 
</P>
<P>
 Remember all the fuss made when the Rams passed on Fresno State quarterback 
Trent Dilfer in the draft? Well, maybe it was the right thing to do after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer, who flopped in his first pro start a week ago at San Francisco, 
replaced Craig Erickson in the third quarter of Tampa Bay's 36-13 loss to 
Minnesota and struggled again. 
</P>
<P>
 He fumbled on his first possession, setting up a field goal, and threw an 
interception the next time the Buccaneers got the ball to set up Minnesota's 
fifth field goal for a 36-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer also failed to take advantage of Vernon Turner's team-record 77-yard 
kickoff return to the Minnesota 22 in the fourth quarter, but later threw his 
first NFL touchdown pass to Courtney Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie finished seven of 13 for 75 yards. TONIGHT'S GAME: Green Bay at 
Chicago 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 One week after fullback Merril Hoge retired because of post-concussion 
syndrome, the Bears lost two more offensive players: tight end Chris Gedney was 
placed on injured reserve because of a broken ankle and backup running back Tim 
Worley was placed on the reserve list after missing last week's game for 
undisclosed personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gedney had been the favorite target of Erik Kramer, who is expected to start 
over Steve Walsh. Walsh led the Bears (4-3) to three of their four victories 
and is the fan's choice in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, Jeff Graham emerged last week and caught seven passes for 
136 yards and a touchdown against the Lions. He leads the Bears with 28 
receptions for 417 yards and two touchdowns while former USC star Curtis Conway 
has 24 catches for 302 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Packer quarterback Brett Favre is listed as probable -- he missed most of 
Green Bay's 13-10 overtime loss to the Vikings two Thursdays ago because of a 
hip injury. Sterling Sharpe, as usual, leads the Packers in receiving (42 
catches, 462 yards, five touchdowns), but the Packers (3-4) still need a 
running game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers have the NFL's second-best defense, and are especially strong 
against the run.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bears will retire the jersey numbers of former running back Gale Sayers 
(40) and former linebacker Dick Butkus (51) at halftime. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Meggett has six carries for 36 yards in the Giants' last three games, all 
losses. He averaged 14 carries for 52 yards as the Giants won their first three 
games. His 56-yard punt return for a touchdown was the sixth of his career and 
the first time he has done it twice in a season. . . . Giant quarterback Dave 
Brown has thrown 12 interceptions and 10 in the last five games. Phil Simms had 
nine all last season. . . . Cleveland had scored first in every game this 
season until Sunday's game with Denver. . . . Safety Darren Perry has six of 
the Steelers' nine interceptions. . . . Of Henry Ellard's 45 catches, 43 have 
been for first downs. . . . Philadelphia center David Alexander made his 100th 
consecutive start. . . . Dallas last lost a regular-season road game on Nov. 
21, 1993 at Atlanta. . . . Dallas has won 11 consecutive games in its division. 
. . . How unusual were the two long touchdown passes given up by Dallas? The 
Cowboys had allowed only four pass plays of more than 25 yards in their seven 
previous games. . . . Kansas City's 34-point loss was the worst non-strike loss 
for the Chiefs since 1984, when they were beaten, 45-0, by Seattle. . . . Jim 
Kelly moved into 23rd on the all-time passing yardage list. He finished with 
184 yards to surpass the 28,000-yard mark. He now has 28,004. . . . Barry 
Sanders hasn't turned over the ball in 561 consecutive plays. . . . The Giants' 
five-game losing streak is the worst under Coach Dan Reeves and the longest 
skid since the team lost that many under Ray Handley late in the '92 season. 
It's one short of Reeves' worst stint as a coach. He lost six in a row while 
coaching the 1990 Denver Broncos. . . . The Giants have forced 19 turnovers all 
season, resulting in four touchdowns and four field goals. . . . Anthony 
Parker's interception return that gave the Vikings a 10-0 lead was Minnesota's 
fifth defensive touchdown of the year. The team has 15 defensive touchdowns in 
the past 36 regular-season games, the most in the NFL. . . . The Vikings 
improved to 17-4 on the road under Coach Dennis Green. . . . Vernon Turner of 
Tampa Bay returned eight kickoffs for a team-record 242 yards, including a 
club-record 77-yarder in the fourth quarter. . . . The Chargers' 7-1 start is 
their best since the strike season of 1987, when they opened 8-1. But they lost 
their last six games that year and missed the playoffs. . . . Art Monk scored 
his first touchdown with the New York Jets and the 66th of his career in the 
second quarter against the Colts. Monk extended his streak of consecutive games 
with at least one reception to 172 games and moved within five of the record 
held by Steve Largent. . . . Marshall Faulk's second touchdown was his eighth 
rushing this year, the most by a Colt since Eric Dickerson had 14 in 1988. . . 
. The Seahawks will play their first game of 1994 in the Kingdome next Sunday 
against the Cincinnati Bengals. BUT HOW DO YOU REALLY FEEL? 
</P>
<P>
 Even after a 44-10 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo Bills running 
back Thurman Thomas found a reason to get mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas ran for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday and after the game, Thomas 
reluctantly faced the media and quickly grew tired of questions regarding 
team's past troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether the players ever wondered about their stalled offense, 
Thomas said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw the point. . . . yeah, we're scoring less points, but we still 
have a winning record," Thomas said. "You media people, y'all write all that. . 
. . about 'They need to do this and they need to do that.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we're going to do what we want to do. I don't give a damn what y'all say 
or how y'all go about saying it. We're going to do it the way we want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I might take a lot of criticism after I leave this podium or whatever, 
but y'all are not playing. Half of you in here don't even know how to play 
football. All right? So don't even ask no stupid question like that. You want 
to come up with a game plan? You come up with a game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was then asked if the Bills wanted to use the big victory over the 
Chiefs to build momentum for the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 44 points is enough damn momentum," Thomas said, storming out. When 
the reporter tried to ask a follow-up, Thomas told him to shut up. THE NUMBERS 
GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler completed four of five passes for 59 yards on the Raiders' 
game-winning 67-yard drive against the Houston Oilers. Football experts will 
tell you that defense wins championships. The NFL measures defense by yards 
allowed. Houston, with a 1-7 record, has the third-best pass defense in the 
NFL. However, the reason they look so good is because the opponents usually 
jump to such a big early lead that they run the ball the rest of the game. The 
Oilers have allowed more yards rushing than any team in the AFC, but because of 
the misleading pass defense statistics, their defense is ranked second overall. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean? It means it's about time the NFL gets with the program. 
The most accurate way to rank defenses is to rank them by points allowed. Isn't 
that the point of the game, to give up fewer points than the opponent? 
</P>
<P>
 Of the last 10 Super Bowl winners, only one, the 1988 San Francisco 49ers, 
ranked below second overall in that category, and the 49ers were fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics are useful tools when used properly. Unfortunately, they aren't 
being used properly by the NFL. FALL OF THE ROAMIN' UMPIRE 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Al Conway was knocked down after being hit in the head by a pass from 
Miami's Dan Marino. Conway came up bleeding but stayed in the game between the 
Dolphins and New England. INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries suffered a dislocated left elbow. . . . 
Kansas City cornerback Mark Collins was hurt on the opening kickoff when he 
tackled Buffalo's Bucky Brooks. He was taken off the field on a stretcher and 
was later reported to have a deep thigh bruise. Brooks later sprained his left 
knee running back a third-quarter kickoff. . . . New York Giants' center Brian 
Williams suffered a blow to the abdomen late in the first half and was sent to 
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for overnight observation. . . . 
Cleveland quarterback Vinny Testaverde sustained a mild neck sprain on a sack 
and was later sidelined by a hard hit. . . . Denver running back Leonard 
Russell sprained his left ankle. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game, in the locker room, I told the guys, 'This game is rated R 
-- adult language and a lot of violence.' And we really went out there and 
showed them that particular style of play."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill defensive end Bruce Smith after his team defeated Kansas City, 44-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too old for this . . . " -- Chiefs' Joe Montana, according to Smith.

CHARGERS RECAPTURE THE WINNING WAY; AFC: ONE WEEK AFTER FIRST LOSS OF SEASON, 
SAN DIEGO DEFEATS SEATTLE, 35-15, DESPITE LOSING QUARTERBACK HUMPHRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were rocking in paradise again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Seau was leaping and waving and smiling, even when a fan leaned out of 
the stands and plucked off his cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Natrone Means was bouncing and plowing, his shirttail down to his knees, his 
opponents on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 One week after their first loss of the season, the San Diego Chargers resumed 
speed with a 35-15 victory over the Seattle Seahawks that left a crowd of 
59,001 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium with only one unsettling thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this New Year's Eve? When they wake today, will the party be over? 
</P>
<P>
 By the looks of quarterback Stan Humphries' left elbow, this city is sobering 
up fast. 
</P>
<P>
 While avoiding a rush early in the third quarter, Humphries was tripped by 
linebacker Bob Spitulski and fell hard on his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 The diagnosis: A dislocation of his non-throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 The prognosis: Doctors say he will be sidelined 10-14 days, which could mean 
sitting out games in Atlanta and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Gale Gilbert, a career backup quarterback who had thrown 15 passes 
in the last seven years -- that is not a misprint -- is now in control of the 
team with the AFC's best record. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-1 Chargers led by the 2.1-passes-per-year man. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tin man!" said Charger defensive tackle Reuben Davis with a laugh. "At 
least, that's what everybody was calling him in the newspaper, saying he had 
all kinds of rust on him. . . . But I tell you what. The tin man held up pretty 
well today." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert indeed put up decent numbers Sunday, 11 completions in 14 attempts 
with two touchdowns and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was only the second game in which he has thrown a touchdown pass in 
eight years . 
</P>
<P>
 And memories are still fresh of his performance a week ago against Denver, 
when he took over on the last drive of the game after Humphries limped out with 
a twisted ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing to lead the Chargers to a touchdown to overcome a 20-15 deficit, 
Gilbert completed two of six passes for 20 yards and the NFL no longer 
possessed an unbeaten team. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, he was playing against a disorganized, dispirited team that seems 
badly in need of a new head coach. Perhaps it is time that Seahawk boss Tom 
Flores rid himself of those dark sunglasses so his players can see what he is 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert needed only to avoid major mistakes. He took over with the Chargers 
leading, 14-7, and responded by giving Means the ball on his first three snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 So the question remains. Can the Chargers win with Gale Gilbert at 
quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 Seau, who was brilliant again while leading a defense that held the Seahawks 
to 76 yards and two first downs the second half, was asked that. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to say that we couldn't win without Stan would be putting down our 
second string, putting down some of the other guys on the team, and I will not 
do that," Seau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Brock, veteran tackle who helped clear the way for Means' club-record 
fourth consecutive game of at least 100 yards rushing (104) was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uhhhhh," he said, pausing. "Well, we have the type of team where everyone has 
to play their best even when our big guy's in there ." 
</P>
<P>
 Means was also asked. He gave an answer that spoke for the mood of a locker 
room in which the players walked around with victory cigars that nobody dared 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is something that nobody is thinking about," said Means of the prospects 
of winning without Humphries. "We're not even talking about that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries sure looked like he was thinking about it. Emerging from the 
training room with his left arm in a bandage and sling, he sounded as confused 
as everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had something like this, I don't know what to expect," he said. "I 
don't know how long it takes, I don't know much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He did know that most of his left arm was numb, and that it was difficult to 
extend. 
</P>
<P>
 And everyone knows that it is nearly impossible to accept a snap from center 
and hand a ball to a teammate, even a target as huge as Means, without full 
feeling and flexibility in both arms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Humphries has played with great pain before, as anyone who watched him 
beat the Raiders with one knee earlier this year can attest. 
</P>
<P>
 And his teammates, well, they fell behind the Seahawks, 7-0, early in the 
second quarter. And they seemed out of sorts when the officials said Tony 
Martin was out of bounds on what was clearly a touchdown catch that would have 
given them the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens? They recover a fumble by Chris Warren a few seconds later and 
score anyway, on a surprise 15-yard run up the middle by Harmon. Leading, 14-7, 
at halftime, the defense turned it on and it was never close again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things are down, this defense, we get it, and get it, and get it," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of the third quarter Sunday, they are going to need it, and need it, and 
need it.

ELWAY, BRONCOS STOP BROWNS' WINNING STREAK; AFC: DENVER QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 
349 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN 26-14 VICTORY OVER CLEVELAND, WHICH HAD WON 
FIVE GAMES IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 John Elway treated the Cleveland Browns as if this were another AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, regarded as a villain in Cleveland after beating the Browns in three 
conference championships, completed 30 of 41 passes for 349 yards and two 
touchdowns Sunday in the Denver Broncos' 26-14 victory that ended the Browns' 
five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (3-5), defeating a division leader for the second week in a row, ended 
a four-game home losing streak and defeated the Browns (6-2) for the fourth 
consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're slowly clawing our way back into this thing," Elway said. "But we've 
got to get to .500 before we even think about the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos generated 457 total yards, and Elway became the first quarterback 
this season to throw for 300 yards against a defense that had allowed the 
fewest points in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway completed 18 of 20 passes in the first half, leading Denver to a 14-6 
lead. Two field goals by Jason Elam in the third quarter made it 20-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rypien, who replaced a dazed Vinny Testaverde as Browns' quarterback late 
in the first half, engineered a 60-yard scoring drive and a two-point 
conversion that cut the deficit to 20-14 early in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Denver responded with a 74-yard, six-play drive for the clinching score. 
Derek Russell caught a short pass and turned it into a 43-yard gain. Two plays 
later, Elway connected with Glyn Milburn on a 17-yard touchdown pass play with 
11:35 left.

IT'S NOT PRETTY, BUT MAJKOWSKI AND COLTS WIN; AFC: IN HIS FIRST START IN TWO 
YEARS, QUARTERBACK SURVIVES THREE FUMBLES AND TWO INTERCEPTIONS FOR A 28-25 
VICTORY OVER JETS.

<P>
 The Majik Man got lucky, no thanks to his butter-fingered teammates and a 
couple errant passes of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Majkowski, making his first NFL start in two years, passed for one 
touchdown and ran for another as the Indianapolis Colts survived five turnovers 
and defeated the New York Jets, 28-25, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt comfortable, but as the game went on they made a lot of adjustments 
that took a lot of things away," Majkowski said. "They made it a lot more 
difficult to throw the ball, but we mixed it up and . . . found ways to be 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Promoted to start ahead of Jim Harbaugh earlier in the week, Majkowski was 14 
of 22 for 159 yards in his first start since he was released by Green Bay after 
the 1992 season. "It feels good to get my first one over with. I've waited for 
two years," he said. "We hung in there. We played really well, but at crucial 
times gave the ball up so many times when we had momentum going, we let them 
back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts (4-5) took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, but lost three of four 
fumbles and had two passes by Majkowski intercepted. One was returned 18 yards 
for a touchdown by Mo Lewis late in the third quarter. A two-point conversion 
pass from Boomer Esiason to Rob Moore made the score 21-18. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk, who had a one-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, added a 
touchdown on a fourth-down, 29-yard carry midway through the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets (4-4) came back with a 41-yard touchdown pass from Esiason to Moore 
with 5:21 left. Then, after an Indianapolis punt two minutes later, Esiason 
took the Jets to the Colts' 38, where a fourth-and-one pass to Moore came up 
two inches short after a hard tackle by Eugene Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need some big plays on both sides of the ball," Majkowski said. "We came 
up with a big play when Marshall scored on fourth and one. Then the defense 
came up and stopped them. That was a big play." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk, the second player picked in this year's draft, rushed 24 times for 110 
yards. The game ended with Indianapolis at the New York seven after a 31-yard 
run by Faulk and two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on the Jets' Donald 
Evans, who was ejected.

PARCELLS EMBARRASSED BY 23-3 LOSS TO DOLPHINS; AFC: PATRIOT COACH HINTS AT A 
SHAKEUP AFTER SAYING PLAYERS "AREN'T ALLOWING US TO WIN." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 A discouraged Bill Parcells ripped into his New England Patriots as badly as 
the Miami Dolphins had done in dominating them, 23-3, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't only Drew Bledsoe, who had his worst game of the season in a rematch 
of his thrilling, opening-day shootout with Dan Marino. It wasn't only the 
defense, which gave up a long touchdown drive to start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 It was everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were outplayed in every phase," the Patriots' second-year coach said. "For 
the first time (since) I've been here I'm really embarrassed by the effort we 
had. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite obvious that we're doing things that aren't going to allow us to 
win, and we're probably doing them with players that aren't allowing us to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 He hinted strongly at a shakeup after the Patriots' biggest loss in 20 games. 
Their third consecutive defeat dropped them to 3-5, three games behind AFC East 
leader Miami (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason for Miami Coach Don Shula to change much after the Dolphins, 
who got two touchdowns from Keith Byars and three field goals from Pete 
Stoyanovich, held their one-game lead over Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great defensive effort (against the NFL's top-rated offense)," Shula 
said. "The touchdown before halftime was a key, but the real key was the drive 
that opened up the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami, which began the game second in the league in offense, took a 13-3 lead 
on Byars' one-yard run seven seconds before halftime. The second touchdown, on 
the first series of the second half, was Marino's seven-yard pass to Byars that 
made it 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware that Buffalo had turned in a big win, but our defense played 
great and I thought our running game played great," said Marino, who completed 
21 of 36 passes for 198 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions. "When 
we had to throw, we threw well enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe started the day as the NFL leader in passing yards. He was tied for 
the lead with 11 interceptions. On Sunday, he was 16 of 33 for 125 yards with 
three interceptions that led to 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first meeting this season, Marino and Bledsoe put on a passing show. 
Marino threw for 473 yards and five touchdowns and Bledsoe piled up 421 yards 
and four scores as Miami won, 39-35.

SMITH TURNS MONTANA INTO OLD MAN; AFC:BILLS' DEFENSIVE END MAKES CHIEFS' 
38-YEAR-OLD QUARTERBACK MISERABLE AS BUFFALO ROLLS, 44-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Smith still knows how to give Joe Montana headaches. And the Buffalo 
Bills still know how to win big games. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith forced an interception and recovered one of Montana's two fumbles 
Sunday, and Jim Kelly threw four touchdown passes to lead the Bills past the 
Kansas City Chiefs, 44-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a replay of last year's AFC championship game, in which Smith 
helped knock out Montana with a concussion early in the second half and Buffalo 
won, 30-13, to earn its fourth consecutive Super Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Montana wasn't injured, only ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old quarterback completed 12 of 21 passes for 124 yards and was 
sacked three times before being relieved in the third quarter by Steve Bono. 
Montana had three turnovers that led to 13 Buffalo points -- including a fumble 
and an interception in the last two minutes of the first half that helped the 
Bills extend a 21-7 lead to 31-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had seven hurries, six tackles and one sack in addition to the fumble 
recovery and forced fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills (5-3) came out of their bye week intent on making amends for an 
embarrassing loss to Indianapolis and proving they are still the team to beat 
in the AFC. The Chiefs (5-3) hoped a healthy Montana would be the difference 
against the team that has knocked them out of the playoffs two of the last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Buffalo handed them their worst non-strike loss since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Reed caught five passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns, and Pete 
Metzelaars also had two touchdowns for Buffalo. Kelly was 14 of 22 for 184 
yards and the Bills forced five turnovers while giving away none for the first 
time all year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Buffalo had a 14-7 lead and a third-and-three from its 
38 yard-line when Kelly connected with Reed for a gain of 57. It was Buffalo's 
longest play from scrimmage until Kenny Davis ran for 60 yards in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed caught it in the flat at the Bills' 43 and headed for the right sideline, 
racing to the five before he was knocked out of bounds by William White. Three 
plays later, Thomas ran around the left side two yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Chiefs' next possession, Montana tried a wraparound handoff to Marcus 
Allen, but Allen never got the ball. Darryl Talley fell on it, and four plays 
later Steve Christie's 49-yard field goal made the score 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie added two field goals in the second half. He got two chances to make 
the first one because an offsides penalty on the Chiefs nullified a block. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie is 15 of 15 this season, a new team record for consecutive field 
goals. The old mark of 13 was held by Scott Norwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Christie's second-quarter field goal, the Chiefs went backward. 
Smith sacked Montana on first down, and on second down Cornelius Bennett 
grabbed Montana's arm as he tried to throw and the ball came loose. Smith fell 
on it at the Chiefs' 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later from the six, Kelly rolled left and found Reed in the back 
of the end zone to make the halftime score 31-7.

ARIZONA CONVERTS OVERTIME FUMBLE INTO VICTORY; INTERCONFERENCE: DAVIS RETURNS 
FROM INJURY, KICKS 51-YARD FIELD GOAL TO DEFEAT PITTSBURGH, 20-17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In his first game since pulling his left hamstring against Dallas three weeks 
ago, Greg Davis couldn't get much distance on his kickoffs. His last field-goal 
attempt was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis cleared the crossbar with room to spare on a 51-yard field goal 1:40 
into overtime Sunday night, delivering a 20-17 victory over the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said Coach Buddy Ryan didn't want to gamble on a kick from that distance 
so early in overtime. That made Davis angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept telling me I wouldn't make it because I hadn't kicked it that far all 
week," Davis said. "I told him in pregame (warmups) we kicked it 55. I looked 
him right in the eye, and he gave it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said Davis' eye-to-eye confidence convinced him to go for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he'd looked down, he wouldn't have been kicking," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The field goal was set up when Pittsburgh rookie Charles Johnson fumbled the 
kickoff beginning the overtime. David Merritt recovered at the Pittsburgh 32, 
and Davis connected four plays later on only the sixth field goal of more than 
50 yards in the NFL this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They popped it out," Johnson said. "You've just got to make the plays. I was 
put in a situation to make the plays, and I didn't. We put ourselves in 
position to win this game. It just came down to one play." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Kirk, who caused the fumble, said the Cardinals (3-5) were learning how 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of will and a lot of fire on this team," Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Beuerlein's passing set up short touchdown runs by Larry Centers and 
Ronald Moore for Arizona. But Gary Anderson's 23-yard field goal with 47 
seconds left tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was made possible when Neil O'Donnell, with a tackler wrapped around 
his legs, found Eric Green with a desperation pass. The 280-pound tight end 
rambled 46 yards to the Arizona 5 with 62 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona safety Terry Hoage tackled Green to prevent what would have been the 
winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The tying field goal came after Anderson failed to get a first down on a fake 
field goal earlier in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Cowher called the trick play twice -- once after a five-yard false 
start took the Steelers back from the 21 to the 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the fourth quarter Hoage recovered a fumble by Green after a hard 
tackle by Lorenzo Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 But Derek Ware fumbled after a 17-yard pass from Beuerlein on the next play, 
and Carnell Lake recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Pittsburgh drive stalled, the Steelers (5-3) tried the fake field goal 
from the Arizona 26. Anderson ran left, but Hoage tackled him on the 24, five 
yards short of a first down.

IN FIRST START, BLAKE SCARES COWBOYS; INTERCONFERENCE: BENGALS' NO. 3 
QUARTERBACK STRIKES FOR TWO QUICK TOUCHDOWNS, BUT DALLAS RALLIES TO WIN, 23-20. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jeff Blake didn't get the upset that would have made him part of NFL lore. He 
did get the thing he wanted most Sunday: respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake turned his first NFL start into a first-rate scare for the Dallas 
Cowboys, stunning them with a pair of long touchdown passes. But the Cowboys 
showed why they're two-time defending Super Bowl champions, regrouping from the 
two-touchdown deficit for a 23-20 victory over the winless Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Aikman shook off another blow to the head only one week after sustaining 
a concussion and threw a pair of first-half touchdown passes. Chris Boniol 
kicked three second-half field goals to give Dallas (7-1) its seventh 
consecutive road victory, matching the club record. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, it avoided a major embarrassment for the defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope there won't be any partying tonight," Coach Barry Switzer said. "There 
shouldn't be. There's not much to be damn happy about." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer warned the Cowboys all week about taking the Bengals (0-8) too lightly 
in this matchup between the NFL's best and worst. Evidently, they didn't 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them this week . . . that we don't want to live a nightmare that 
becomes reality -- that a team like this can win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake nearly turned it into a nightmare at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-string quarterback was forced to start because of injuries to David 
Klingler and Don Hollas. No one expected much from the third-year pro, who had 
virtually no NFL game experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, however, threw for 247 yards and caught the NFL's best defense 
flat-footed twice. He threw touchdown passes of 67 and 55 yards to Darnay Scott 
-- the longest passes allowed this season by the league's best pass defense -- 
for a 14-0 lead one play into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake completed 14 of 32 passes without an interception. Klingler, out with a 
sprained knee, has thrown for 247 yards only once in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he didn't pull a Gus Frerotte -- Washington's rookie quarterback 
who won his first start last week -- Blake was impressive enough to make the 
Bengals think of him as a solid backup when Klingler is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I really wanted, some respect," Blake said. "I think I got that 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman started the Cowboys' turnaround by connecting with Alvin Harper in 
double coverage for a 27-yard touchdown pass to culminate a four-play, 65-yard 
drive in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals then reverted to bumbling late in the first half, helping the 
Cowboys put together a 13-play drive that ended with Aikman's 10-yard touchdown 
pass to Michael Irvin. Linebacker James Francis hit Aikman on the chin with a 
forearm after he threw a fourth-down incompletion, giving the Cowboys a 
reprieve with the roughing-the-passer penalty. The Bengals also had 12 men on 
the field during the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit by Francis came one week after Arizona's Wilber Marshall knocked 
Aikman out with a hard hit to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said he was pushed into Aikman; the quarterback said the hit didn't 
affect him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got a good lick on me, but I came out OK," Aikman said. "I feel it was a 
call that was warranted."

VIKING DEFENSE MAKES ITS POINT AGAIN; NFC: CORNERBACK PARKER SCORES FOR THIRD 
TIME IN THREE GAMES AND FIVE TURNOVERS COST TAMPA BAY IN 36-13 LOSS.

<P>
 Once again, Minnesota's offensive-minded defense made it easy for Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Anthony Parker scored his third touchdown in the last three games, 
returning an interception 41 yards, and the Vikings forced five turnovers on 
the way to a 36-13 rout of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon threw for 182 yards and one touchdown and Fuad Reveiz kicked five field 
goals as the Vikings dominated despite producing only two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Allen rushed for 113 yards and one touchdown for the Vikings (6-2), and 
the defense intercepted three passes, recovered fumbles by quarterbacks Craig 
Erickson and Trent Dilfer and scored for the fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker had an interception return against the New York Giants on Oct. 10 and 
picked up a teammate's fumble and scored against Green Bay last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just something we've been able to do here. They stress it in practice," 
Parker said of the Vikings' 15 defensive touchdowns in their last 36 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-year cornerback from Arizona State became the first defensive player 
to score in three consecutive games for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers (2-6), outscored 111-42 in their last three games, were 
fortunate to only trail, 23-7, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon threw behind a wide-open Adrian Cooper in the end zone before settling 
for a 21-yard field goal late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 He barely missed Qadry Ismail in the end zone on consecutive plays before 
Reveiz kicked a 48-yarder for the 16-point half-time lead.

LIONS TRUE MASTERS OF OVERTIME; NFC: THEY BECOME FIRST NFL TEAM TO WIN IN EXTRA 
PERIOD THREE TIMES IN ONE SEASON, DEFEATING THE GIANTS, 28-25.

 Jason Hanson kicked a 24-yard field goal with 8:17 left in overtime after 
Barry Sanders made a critical play after catching a flare pass to keep the 
drive alive and the Detroit Lions became the first NFL team to win three 
overtime games in a season by defeating the New York Giants, 28-25, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders set up a go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter with a 62-yard run 
and got the Lions in position for the game-winning field goal by gaining nine 
yards after catching the flare pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe if I get the ball in my hands that sooner or later something will 
break," said Sanders, who rushed for 146 yards, giving him 1,035 yards this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who joined Eric Dickerson as the only NFL back to rush for 1,000 
yards in each of his first six seasons, did little in the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came his two crucial plays. His 62-yard run in the fourth quarter set 
up a one-yard touchdown pass from Scott Mitchell to Herman Moore and Sanders' 
flare-pass play on third and nine from the Lions' 25 in overtime helped set up 
Hanson's game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders made two tacklers miss after catching the pass and then ran over 
safety John Booty for the final two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That run he made on the swing pass was the greatest run I've ever seen him 
make," Lion Coach Wayne Fontes said. "When you consider the circumstances, if 
we don't make the first down, we have to give up the ball and probably lose. 
There is something special about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, Sanders ran for 16 yards and then the officials struck. 
</P>
<P>
 On first and 10 from the New York 36, Mitchell, who threw two touchdown passes 
to Moore, threw to him at the 33. Giant safety Jarvis Williams knocked Moore to 
a knee, but the officials didn't blow the play dead. Moore got up and was 
tackled at the seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, his knee was down," Giant cornerback Thomas Randolph said. "I wouldn't 
stop if his knee didn't touch the ground. The whole team stopped. Even Detroit 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Gary Lane would not comment on the play.

LUCK RUNS OUT AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME FOR OILERS; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER 
LEADING LATE IN THE GAME, HOUSTON GIVES UP TOUCHDOWN, THEN DEL GRECO'S FIELD 
GOAL TAKES A BAD BOUNCE.

<P>
 And the Raiders thought they had problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a few inches had gone our way, we could easily be 4-4 right now instead of 
1-7," Houston wide receiver Haywood Jeffires said after the Oilers' 17-14 
dramatic loss to the Raiders at the Coliseum. "It hurts every time you lose, 
but this is really tough to explain." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding ways to lose is something Houston has done all season and Sunday was 
no different as the Oilers watched their overtime hopes fall short when Al Del 
Greco's 52-yard field goal hit the middle of the crossbar on the game's last 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say things always find a way to even out," Del Greco said. "If that's 
true, then we should be in for some good luck for the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 To say that the Oilers had their chances for an upset would be an 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting the Raiders a 7-0 lead early in the game, Houston bounced back 
with several big defensive plays after a fumble by quarterback Billy Joe 
Tolliver and botched drives to keep the score close in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers had key second-quarter interceptions by Darryll Lewis and Marcus 
Robertson to kill Raider drives and stay within a touchdown. Then, Houston tied 
the score with 26 seconds remaining before halftime when Tolliver scrambled for 
a six-yard touchdown run to complete an eight-play, 82-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in trouble early when we had a chance to go down by two touchdowns," 
Houston Coach Jack Pardee said. "We were able to make some plays and keep the 
thing close and that was what we were hoping to do coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' luck continued to improve in the second half when they held the 
Raiders to one third-quarter field goal despite turning the ball over on two 
Tolliver fumbles inside their 25-yard line in a span of two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 They did it by forcing two turnovers of their own as the Oilers remained close 
until 9:54 to play. That's when Houston took the ball on a 15-play, 86-yard 
drive that was capped with a seven-yard touchdown pass play from Tolliver to 
Jeffires to give the Oilers a 14-10 lead with 3:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
 For most NFL teams, a lead that late in a game would be a positive. However, 
not with the bad-luck Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew exactly what they would try to do and that would be to get the ball 
into Tim Brown and Harvey Williams' hands," Houston cornerback Chris Dishman 
said. "But we could not come up with the plays to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 After Jeffires' touchdown, the Raiders needed only six plays and 81 seconds to 
drive to the Oilers' 11-yard line. On the next play, the Oilers came up inches 
short again. 
</P>
<P>
 With quarterback Jeff Hostetler flushed out of the pocket running to his 
right, Dishman saw Brown breaking free in the back of the end zone.  
</P>
<P>
 "I watched Hostetler's eyes and he was looking at Tim all the way," Dishman 
said. "It was my fault because I ran over to make the play but instead, I 
knocked (teammate) Lewis off his coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 That was all Brown needed as he grabbed the game-winning touchdown pass with 
1:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "That play sums up our season right there," Lewis said. "We had our 
opportunities but we just didn't make the plays when we should have." 
</P>
<P>
 To Houston's credit, it did not give up. With Tolliver directing an offense 
that was handed to him by injured starter Cody Carlson, the Oilers converted on 
two fourth-down plays to move within distance for Del Greco's final kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 11 years in the league, I've never had the ball hit the crossbar and 
bounce back like it did," he said. "That was until this year. It's now happened 
twice to me. Once in Pittsburgh and once here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be better for me to live with if I had just kicked the ball poorly, 
but that wasn't the case. I kicked the ball real good right down the middle. I 
got a lot of foot on it but it was just a couple of inches short." 
</P>
<P>
 With no real chance for the playoffs, how will the Oilers approach their final 
eight games of the season? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I know is to keep on fighting," Jeffires said. "Of course, 
this season has not gone like we all had hoped and this is a far cry from when 
we were winning when we had (quarterback Warren Moon). But this team has pride 
and I'm sure that we'll keep on trying."

ESPERANZA'S NIHIPALI LOOKS TO FUTURE IN SUNSET LEAGUE; VOLLEYBALL: AZTECS' 
YOUNG PLAYERS ARE WORKING THROUGH THE ROUGH SPOTS OF A TOUGH MOVE FROM THE 
EMPIRE LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amid Esperanza's first season in the Sunset League, Amy Nihipali has shown the 
volleyball team's future holds promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Her older brother Paul, a 6-foot-7 middle blocker, led the Aztecs to the 
Southern Section Division II boys' volleyball championship in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Nihipali was named Southern Section Division II player of the year that 
season, and now he plays at UCLA. He earned all NCAA-tournament team honors 
last season, helping the Bruins reach the NCAA championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his little sister -- make that younger sister -- is a 6-2 sophomore who 
has stepped up her play to help Esperanza climb back into the playoff hunt 
after the Aztecs took some lumps early this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (6-6, 4-4 in league) is tied with Marina (9-7, 4-4) for third place 
in league -- which also carries the league's final automatic playoff berth -- 
and the Aztecs begin the final week of league play with a match Tuesday at 
Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to qualify for the playoffs is a new experience for Esperanza and 
Los Alamitos, two teams that used to dominate the Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
 But since moving to the Sunset League this season, Los Alamitos, which won the 
Southern Section Division II championship last season, has not won a league 
match and probably will miss the Division I playoffs. Esperanza finished 16-3 
last season, but started this season losing four of its first six matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sunset League is forcing us to grow as a volleyball team," Esperanza 
Coach Kurt Kersten said. "If we were still in the Empire League now, we might 
be undefeated in league and maybe ranked fourth in county. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think now, playing against all of these tough teams, we'll be more 
prepared for CIF . . . if we get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza has rebounded from its sluggish start, and regained some confidence 
by defeating Los Angeles Notre Dame Academy in the championship match of the 
Los Angeles Marlborough tournament Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tournament helped us believe in ourselves," Kersten said. "In the final 
match, we rallied from a big deficit to win, 16-14. That was the first time we 
came from behind all season." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent league matches, Esperanza challenged Edison (14-0, 8-0), ranked 
second in Orange County, but lost in five games Oct. 20. The Aztecs lost 
another tight match, a four-game loss to fourth-ranked Huntington Beach (10-3, 
6-2), Oct. 25 before defeating Los Alamitos in five games Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nihipali's development has keyed the Aztecs' recent surge. She had 12 blocks 
in the loss to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's one of the best middle blockers in the county," Kersten said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the season began, Nihipali was only one of the team's returning starters. 
Although the Aztecs lost two key starters -- Lynette Anderson, who is now at 
Georgia Tech, and Kari Wehner, now at Santa Clara -- the Aztecs weren't short 
on talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Two senior all-leaguers, Kristy Kierulff and Laura Echolds, returned with 
Nihipali and setter Allison Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Kierulff, a 5-8 outside hitter who won the State high jump championship last 
season, is being recruited by Long Beach State, USC, Arizona State and UCLA. 
Echolds, a 6-foot middle blocker and three-year starter, has orally committed 
to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Aztecs started slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rearranged a lot of attitudes after we went to Huntington Beach and 
embarrassed ourselves by losing in three games the first time we played them," 
Kersten said. "Amy was one player who wasn't afraid to speak up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nihipali: "I'm a lot more comfortable with the team this year and we're 
all really good friends. I'm probably a more vocal-type, while Kristy would 
rather lead by example and just go up and pound the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of frustration early and we were inconsistent. But it's kind 
of hard to avoid because after club season ends, coming to your high school 
team with a new set of girls, it's like starting from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning was routine for Nihipali during club season. She played with the 
Orange County Volleyball Club's 16-and-under team, which also featured Mater 
Dei standout Roberta Gehlke and Laguna Beach's Michelle Christ, and tournament 
victories were expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amy wants to get a Division I scholarship, so she's chosen one sport to focus 
on and played with the Orange County club last year," Kersten said. "Right now 
she's probably a lot further along than Paul was as a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, individual accomplishments and career goals are not foremost in 
Nihipali's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team should go out and just feel like they can compete at this level," 
Nihipali said. "We've improved so much in the last two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Nihipali hopes the Aztecs will be playing in two weeks when the playoffs 
begin. But even if Esperanza misses the postseason this year, Nihipali will 
have two more seasons to try to match the legacy of her older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot to live up to," she said. "But it fires me up to try to play at 
that level."

 The Sacramento Kings have signed first-round draft pick Brian Grant to a 
contract, the NBA team announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings did not disclose terms of the contract, but the Sacramento Bee 
reported Grant was signing a 13-year, $29.33 million pact. The newspaper 
reported the final season's salary of $3.7 million would not be guaranteed 
until Grant remains in the league a seventh season. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, a 6-foot-9, 254-pound forward who played for Xavier University in 
Cincinnati, was the eighth selection in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 During a telephone news conference after the draft last June, Grant said he 
planned to ask for a contract worth $2.50, "enough for a Dr Pepper and a bag of 
chips." Motor sports

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; MAGICAL MAIDEN RUNS ON TURF AS IF IT WERE A DAY IN THE 
DIRT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Magical Maiden found out Sunday she likes grass just as much as dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven victories, five seconds and six thirds in 22 starts on dirt, 
Magical Maiden's turf debut was equally as impressive at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenged in the stretch by Miss Turkana and Fondly Remembered, the 
5-year-old Lord Avie mare responded with a half-length victory in the $83,550 
Louis R. Rowan Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Gary Stevens, the horse's main jockey, Magical Maiden covered the 
mile in 1:36 and paid $10.20 as the 4-1 second choice. She also survived a foul 
claim by Gary Jones, Miss Turkana's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-1 shot, Miss Turkana finished a half-length in front of 9-2 shot Fondly 
Remembered. Shir Dar, the 3-1 favorite, was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 While she may have given owner Clement Hirsch and trainer Warren Stute some 
anxious moments, Stevens wasn't worried in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's hard to say that you can be confident when it comes down that 
close," Stevens said. "But I feel more confidence on her than any horse I've 
ever ridden when you know it's going to come down to a photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows where the wire is, and she always seems to have a little something 
in reserve. She always seems to stick her nose out at the right time. Like 
she's done so many times before, she gave me that little extra burst right 
before the wire today." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Magical Maiden has shown she can handle turf, Stute is contemplating 
bringing entering her in Sunday's $400,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The beaten favorite in the Hillsborough Handicap at Bay Meadows last month, 
Miss Turkana perked up with the return to Santa Anita. She has two wins, a 
second and two thirds in eight tries.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was some contact in the stretch, but apparently not enough to take 
(Magical Maiden's) number down," said Antonio Castanon, Miss Turkana's rider. 
"She tried very hard today, but she might have needed the race." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Del Mar Oaks winner Twice The Vice, who apparently didn't care for the track 
at Keeneland when unplaced in the recent Spinster, heads a field of eight 
3-year-old fillies in Wednesday's $100,000 Linda Vista Breeders' Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye will be reunited with trainer Tom Bell's filly, who broke 
her maiden and won the Anoakia Stakes last year at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field, from the rail out, includes Princess Mitterand, Crissy 
Aya, who will be ridden by champion Japanese jockey Yutaka Take, Dancing 
Mirage, Malli Star, Rotten Row, Dianes Halo and Just Tops. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the favorites didn't win a race in the Pick Six, there was one 
correct ticket that paid more than $513,000. . . . Gary Stevens won two other 
races besides the Rowan -- the second with Lomonds Double and the fourth with 
Creston.

COLLEGE SOCCER; NO. 1 INDIANA DEFEATS UCLA, 2-0, BUT FULLERTON WINS TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was billed as the feature game of the week in men's college soccer, but 
top-ranked Indiana's 2-0 victory over fourth-ranked UCLA on Sunday turned out 
to be little more than an afterthought to earlier games in the UCLA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have taken a remarkable game to upstage unranked Cal State 
Fullerton's victory against Indiana on Friday.Instead, Indiana dominated the 
midfield and, as UCLA players became increasingly frustrated, play 
deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (10-6-2), which tied Notre Dame, 2-2, in overtime earlier in the 
day, won the tournament with a 1-0-1 record. UCLA (15-2) and Indiana (17-2) 
finished 1-1 and Notre Dame (8-9-2) was 0-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers scored in the 36th minute when Todd Yeagley received a corner 
kick from Joel Shanker and headed the ball toward the far post and into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 They scored again with 25 minutes left on an own goal by UCLA's Brian 
Woolfolk, who was trying to defend against Yeagley's free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time UCLA has been shut out since Oct. 9, 1992, when it lost 
to New Mexico, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's midfield is led by three seniors, Yeagley, Brandon Ward and Brian 
Maisonneuve, who was named the tournament's offensive MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Fullerton's Eddie Soto tied the score on a penalty shot 
with 11 minutes remaining in regulation, sending the game into overtime, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 minutes left in overtime, Tim Oates scored on a crossing pass from 
Ryan Turner to give Notre Dame the lead. Five minutes later, Matt Bradbury 
scored on a header toward the far post on a pass from Soto.

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; MEETINGS SHOW ACTION ISN'T ONLY ON THE PITCH 
</P>

<P>
 What really happened at the FIFA meetings in New York last week? 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, all seemed to go smoothly, and the leaders of international 
soccer's governing body said as much at their closing news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no rivalry between the confederations," said FIFA President Joao 
Havelange. "There was a discussion (on allocating World Cup '98 places) and a 
final decision was reached. It was unanimously adopted, so there was no 
rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 With 14 television cameras rolling and dozens of reporters crammed into an 
inadequate room, Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA's general secretary, echoed 
Havelange's words. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a general consensus on the division of teams," Blatter said. "There 
was no rivalry. There was no fighting. It was a general consensus, therefore it 
was done in a fair manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all a lie. A cover-up. A deliberate attempt to pull the wool over the 
eyes of a press that all too many in FIFA's hierarchy continue to view as 
either ignorant, indifferent or malleable. 
</P>
<P>
 What really happened during the three days of meetings was a series of furious 
arguments followed by a blatant instance of abuse of power by Havelange, the 
78-year-old Brazilian who has ruled FIFA in an increasingly autocratic manner 
since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 How intense were the arguments? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not cordial," said Trinidad & Tobago's Jack Warner, the president of 
CONCACAF. "It was very combative, very adversarial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot continue with this guerrilla warfare for every World Cup. There has 
to be a principle established that will stop this. We must try to be objective 
and become football officials, not football politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, who has led CONCACAF, the North and Central American and Caribbean 
region, since 1990, should know better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tens of millions of dollars that are at stake in international soccer 
these days, and the perks that come with power, politics is what it is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner is slowly admitting as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "For sure, these guys have made deals behind backs," he said. "They have made 
deals for the 1998 (FIFA) elections. They have made deals for all kinds of 
things. There's no question, (but) I have no idea of who made what deals or 
what promises have been given." 
</P>
<P>
 One day after voicing those remarks, Warner found out. 
</P>
<P>
 In an astonishingly brazen move during the FIFA Executive Committee meeting, 
Havelange first postponed the second item on the agenda, the decision on 
appointments to FIFA's key committees. Then, at the end of the meeting, he 
produced a printed list, announced that these were the appointments and 
summarily ended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had seen the list before. There was no discussion. There was no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 What committee members found after examining the list was that Havelange had 
removed his "hidden enemies," real or imagined, from all committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those tossed out were the general secretaries of the European, African, 
Asian and CONCACAF regions -- Gerhard Aigner of Switzerland, Mustapha Fahmi of 
Egypt, Peter Velappan of Malaysia and Chuck Blazer of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Also removed was Paolo Casarin of Italy, one of the world's top refereeing 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian daily Gazetta Dello Sport was outraged. In Saturday's edition, 
under the headline "Night of the Long Knives at FIFA," writer Sergio Di Cesare 
expressed this opinion: 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange's actions, he wrote, represent "a sweeping purge like nothing that 
has ever happened before in the history of world sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget the Stalinist purges, football seems to have returned to the times if 
the Inquisition, with Joao Havelange in the role of Torquemada." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong words, but typical of the anger many in international soccer harbor 
toward Havelange, who managed to win reelection at the FIFA Congress in Chicago 
last June only after promising to increase the World Cup field from 24 teams to 
32, giving more places to Africa and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange apparently feels free to remove from power those he suspects were 
behind the move to oust him, as well as others who have earned his displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, Havelange already is working to see that another Brazilian, Ricardo 
Terra Teixeira, inherits his position as FIFA president. 
</P>
<P>
 Teixeira is Havelange's son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Havelange appointed him vice-chairman of the FIFA Referees 
Committee and a member of the 1998 World Cup Organizing Committee. Both are key 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Teixeira, president of the Brazilian federation, who Pele last year 
accused of corruption, a stance that caused Havelange to ban Pele from taking 
part in the World Cup '94 Draw in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange has said he will not run for reelection when his term ends in 1998. 
Last week he recommended that the FIFA Congress appoint an interim president 
from the Executive Committee to serve a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, Havelange argued, the election of future FIFA presidents would not 
fall in World Cup years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to remove the politics from the sport, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 It just so happens that Teixeira is on the Executive Committee and therefore 
eligible to be chosen for the interim presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 A 47-year-old who describes himself as an economist and stockbroker, Teixeira 
was elevated to the Executive Committee in Chicago in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange continues to position his son-in-law. Moving people like chess 
pieces is one of his strong suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Teixeira was trotted out before the television cameras in New York last week 
-- ostensibly to receive the FIFA Fair Play Award and the Most Entertaining 
Team Award on behalf of the 1994 Brazilian World Cup team. Each award carried a 
$100,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone present knew Teixeira was merely being put on stage for the 
benefit of the "gullible" media. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Havelange pulling the strings again. 
</P>
<P>
 The next few years should prove a fascinating exercise in sporting politics as 
Havelange continues to promote his protege, while Europe's soccer leaders seek 
a way to block Teixeira from assuming the mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 And Havelange might have another vote on his side. One of his appointments to 
the FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee was Alan Rothenberg.

BREEDERS' CUP; SKIPPING MAJOR EVENT WON'T HURT HOLY BULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobbie Croll, the trainer's wife, was sitting on a trunk in their tack room at 
Keeneland. She craned her neck to see Holy Bull, who occupied the first stall 
-- the stall of honor -- just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at him," Jimmy Croll's wife said. "He's looking over here. He knows 
we're talking about him." 
</P>
<P>
 What was being said wouldn't have bothered Holy Bull in the least. Jimmy Croll 
was reviewing the gray 3-year-old colt's 1994 record -- eight victories in 10 
starts and purses of $2 million -- and concluded Holy Bull should be named 
horse of the year. The 250 or so Eclipse Awards voters are likely to validate 
that claim although Holy Bull won't be part of racing's biggest party, the 
Breeders' Cup, at Churchill Downs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only other horse they could give the title to is Paradise Creek," Croll 
said. "Paradise Creek's a fine horse, and he deserves to be grass champion. But 
a grass horse doesn't win horse of the year if there's an outstanding horse on 
dirt, and this is one of those years." 
</P>
<P>
 Croll, 74, has been criticized for skipping the $3-million Breeders' Cup 
Classic, which frequently has determined who wins horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull wasn't nominated when he was a weanling because of a $500 oversight 
by Croll, who inherited the colt when his breeder, Rachel Carpenter, died last 
year. Croll would have had to pay a $360,000 supplementary fee to run him 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the money, it's the timing," Croll said. "I intend to pay it next 
year and run him in the Classic. But this year, the timing was all wrong. The 
horse has been racing for 13 months. He's been in training for 18 months. 
Whether it's machinery, people or horses, you've got to regroup once in a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull was even money or less during the five-race winning streak that 
capped his season, and he would have been odds-on Saturday against Devil His 
Due and Soul of the Matter, who will be the Classic favorites. Between them, 
they have won seven of 17 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeneland, 75 miles east of Churchill Downs, is as close as Holy Bull will get 
to the Classic. By Saturday, the colt will have gone to south Florida to his 
winter home at Gulfstream Park.  
</P>
<P>
 There are no second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people -- and I'm talking about knowledgeable people in racing 
-- are saying that I've done the right thing," Croll said. "We're having a ball 
with this horse, and we want to continue doing that next year. The sport needs 
handicap horses, that's been shown by how few good ones are around this year, 
and we hope to give them one next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull is scheduled to enter a sprint race at Gulfstream in January, which 
will be a prep for the Donn Handicap at the Florida track in February. After 
that, Croll will decide between the $500,000 Gulfstream Park Handicap or the 
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Croll scrapped the Breeders' Cup, he made another somewhat 
unpopular decision, yanking Holy Bull from the other Triple Crown races after 
the 1,150-pound colt finished 12th as the favorite in the Kentucky Derby. Many 
trainers would have sought redemption in the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want this to come off sounding wrong, but if you don't win the Derby, 
the other Triple Crown races don't mean much," Croll said. "I had Bet Twice (in 
1987), and he won the Belmont and was second in the Preakness. We won the 
$1-million (series bonus), but we were second in the Derby, so the rest of the 
races didn't mean much to the horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Alysheba won three races that year -- the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and 
the Super Derby -- and was voted best 3-year-old colt. Holy Bull didn't lose a 
race after the Kentucky Derby, twice beating older horses that included Devil 
His Due. He's a cinch to be the first horse since Slew o' Gold, in 1983, to win 
the 3-year-old title without winning at least one Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll has replayed Holy Bull's Derby dozens of times in his mind and by 
watching a replay. The track at Churchill was sloppy, but Croll discards that 
excuse. He points to two other problems: The colt wasn't particularly sharp in 
the days leading to the race, and he had a miserable start. A good start is 
paramount to success for a speedy horse such as Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 "The training part is a shady area," Croll said. "At Keeneland (where Holy 
Bull won the Blue Grass three weeks before the Derby), he was excellent. Ask 
him for a 0:36 (three-furlong work), and he'd give you 34 and four (fifths). 
When we got over to Churchill, he wasn't the same. He ate all right, but he 
didn't seem to have that zing in the mornings." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of expectedly taking the lead in the Derby, Holy Bull was fifth early 
and never contended.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a photo in one of the local papers after the race," Croll said. "It was 
taken up high, from behind the gate, a length and a half after the start. Both 
of my horse's front feet are high in the air. And Ulises (who broke outside of 
Holy Bull) has his head under my horse's neck. So we broke cockeyed, then we 
got squeezed going into the first turn and got shuffled back." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Keeneland's season ended the day before, there were fans at Croll's 
barn early Sunday, getting a final look at Holy Bull before he leaves Tuesday. 
A National Geographic film crew was doing a feature on Croll and his horse. For 
a horse who has finished for the year, the barn activity has been hectic. A few 
weeks ago, someone stole Holy Bull's new leather halter, one with the horse's 
gold nameplate attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll suspects that someone with access to the shedrow, rather than a fan, 
grabbed a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was on a nail right next to his stall," Croll said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another new halter, more secure than the last, hung on a hook on the wall of 
the tack room Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken away the temptation," Croll said. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla is out of the Breeders' Cup Turf because of a high white blood 
cell count and is expected to run in the Japan Cup on Nov. 27. . . . Donna 
Barton, named by trainer Wayne Lukas to ride Cat Appeal, one of his four 
probables for the Juvenile Fillies, will become the second female jockey to 
compete in a Breeders' Cup. Julie Krone has ridden in seven Breeders' Cup 
races, starting in 1988, and finished second that year aboard Lukas' Darby 
Shuffle in the Juvenile Fillies. Krone lost the mount on Flag Down in 
Saturday's Classic, with Jose Santos being hired after Allen Paulson bought 50% 
of the horse. Barton, who rode six winners for Lukas at Keeneland in October, 
is a daughter of Patti Barton, first woman to win 1,000 races. . . . Noraquilon 
won't run in the Juvenile Fillies because of a bruised foot.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: SCOUT PRAISES COUNTY'S OFFENSIVE LINE PROSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Lascola, a football talent scout who annually looks at more film than 
Siskel and Ebert, gives Orange County a "thumbs up" recommendation. He tells 
college football recruiters: If it's size you want, Orange County is a good 
place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 For 19 years, Lascola, a former high school and college coach, has operated 
the Scouting Evaluation Assn. out of his Fallbrook home. He supplies reports on 
California high school and community college players to more than 90 colleges, 
including every Pac-10 school. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his overall assessment of the California Class of 1995 is "above 
average -- not great but not bad," he gives high marks on his midseason report 
card to offensive line prospects, especially in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say that Orange County kind of mirrors the overall picture in 
California," Lascola said. "One of the real strengths of the county this year 
is offensive linemen. The weaknesses are linebackers, defensive linemen and 
quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Among offensive linemen, Lascola likes Santa Margarita's Kris Farris (6 feet 
8, 275) and Josh Beckett (6-5, 305), Mater Dei's Matt Motherway (6-4, 250), San 
Clemente's Brett Samperi (6-5, 275), Sunny Hills' Glen Giesen (6-6, 295) and 
Sonora's Jason Grain (6-5, 270). 
</P>
<P>
 "Farris really runs well for a kid his size, and he has the frame to put on 
more weight," Lascola said. "You have to look at Beckett because of his size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giesen has stepped up a notch this season. I really like him. He's an 
aggressive blocker who gets good extension with his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motherway is an aggressive kid. Samperi is a raw talent who'll get better. 
Grain has good feet and good size." 
</P>
<P>
 Lascola's favorite offensive line prospect in the Southland is Mark Manskar 
(6-7, 260) of Canyon Country Canyon. "He may be the best lineman in the state. 
He has great size, mobility and is a strong blocker." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 USC receivers coach Mike Sanford was watching Thursday night's Los 
Alamitos-Esperanza game at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. The Trojans are 
among the teams recruiting Los Alamitos' standout wide receiver-safety Brad 
Melsby (6-1, 180), who caught seven passes for 130 yards in the Griffins' 35-32 
victory. Melsby is also considering Stanford (where former Los Alamitos 
teammate Tim Carey is a reserve quarterback), UCLA, Northwestern and Minnesota 
(where he has family ties). 
</P>
<P>
 "Melsby has a great set of hands," Lascola said. "I'm not sure if he's quick 
enough to play defensive back in college, but he can sure catch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford, whose daughter, Lindsay, is a sophomore cheerleader at Los Alamitos, 
said USC plans to recruit three top Griffin juniors: quarterback Kevin Feterik, 
who passed for 369 yards and three touchdowns in the Esperanza game, and wide 
receivers Tony Hartley and Stan Guyness. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more immediate concern to the Trojans, however, is signing a senior 
quarterback. Their top choice is John Fox (6-3, 185) of Corona Centennial, who 
Lascola calls "probably the best passer in Southern California this year. He's 
a good athlete too." USC Coach John Robinson attended Fox's game two weeks ago. 
The Trojans and UCLA are considered the favorites to sign Fox. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora's Jason Grain has four of his recruiting trips set: Arizona State (Dec. 
10), Fresno State (Jan. 14), Oregon State (Jan. 21) and UCLA. For his fifth 
visit, he is considering Colorado State, California and San Diego State. Grain 
comes from a football family; his uncle, Jimmy DuBose, played at Florida and 
for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Another uncle, Keith DuBose, played at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top athletes among football prospects in the Southland is 
quarterback-free safety Chris McAlister (6-1, 180) of Pasadena High. McAlister 
is the son of former UCLA and NFL running back James McAlister, who now serves 
as a Pasadena assistant coach. His brother, James, is a sophomore point guard 
on the Pasadena City College basketball team. The younger McAlister is a 
spectacular open-field runner who might be good enough to return kicks as a 
college freshman. Surprisingly, only three teams -- UCLA, Washington State and 
Brigham Young -- have been recruiting him. Two others, Nebraska and Arizona, 
called early but their interest has since subsided. Apparently, most assume he 
will sign with UCLA. "My dad has been telling me to go wherever I feel the most 
comfortable," McAlister said. "I'm looking for the best opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Football news: Quarterback Steve Sarkisian (6-2, 190) of El Camino College, 
who passed for 481 yards and four touchdowns in a game against Saddleback 
recently, has given an oral commitment to Brigham Young. Sarkisian started his 
college career at USC, where he played baseball for a year before transferring. 
He attended West High in Torrance, where current Brigham Young quarterback John 
Walsh attended before transferring to Carson High as a senior. . . . Another 
top quarterback prospect, Dave Coggin (6-3, 195) of Upland High, took a 
recruiting trip to Florida last weekend. He had earlier visited Miami (Fla.), 
and is scheduled to visit Brigham Young this weekend. Coggin also is considered 
a top pitching prospect in baseball, and a probable first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has received a commitment from perhaps the top offensive line 
prospect in Northern California, Mike McLaughlin (6-4, 260) of San Jose Leland. 
. . . Running back-defensive back Brandon Reynolds (5-11, 180) of Lake Oswego, 
Ore., has committed to Oregon State. Reynolds' brother, Cameron, is a junior 
halfback for the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoop report: Tommy Prince, a 6-5 swingman from Compton Dominguez who is 
considered one of the top three seniors in California (along with 6-7 Paul 
Pierce of Inglewood High and 6-10 Jelani McCoy of San Diego St. Augustine), 
said last week he is still considering UCLA, California, Nevada Las Vegas, 
North Carolina and Maryland, but would not sign a letter of intent until the 
spring. The early signing period is Nov. 9-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince is scheduled to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test on Saturday. He can 
begin taking official recruiting trips after he passes his entrance exam and 
receives approval from the NCAA Clearinghouse. Prince, a smooth left-hander and 
excellent defender, averaged 18 points and seven rebounds as a junior, playing 
close to the basket in Dominguez's team-oriented system. UCLA would love to 
sign either Prince or Pierce (or both, though that is considered highly 
unlikely) to complete a recruiting class that includes McCoy and 6-1 Brandon 
Loyd of Tulsa, Okla., who gave the Bruins oral commitments last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Prince: Prince's younger brother, Tayshaun, a 6-5 freshman at Dominguez, 
is among the better young prospects in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan (Moose) Bailey, a 6-1 guard from Loyola High who is the younger brother 
of UCLA freshman guard Toby Bailey, probably will sign with Portland. Other 
teams recruiting Bailey include Loyola Marymount, Drake, San Jose State and 
George Washington. Bailey also has a strong interest in the University of San 
Diego, but new Torero Coach Brad Holland is hoping to sign another guard, 6-4 
sharpshooter Brock Jacobsen of La Crescenta Crescenta Valley, his alma mater. . 
. . Add Loyola Marymount: The Lions recently received a commitment from 6-6 
forward Jason Perry of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 news: Arizona, which had been unable to recruit a point guard from the 
high school Class of '95, received a pleasant surprise recently when 6-1 Jason 
Terry of Seattle, the top point guard prospect on the West Coast, committed to 
the Wildcats. Why was it a surprise? Because two weeks earlier, Terry had 
orally committed to Washington. The story had been front-page news in Seattle, 
after Terry announced he was staying at home to attend college. "I've never 
seen one like this," said Washington assistant coach Ray Giacoletti. "But if 
you're in this business long enough, nothing surprises you." 
</P>
<P>
 More Pac-10 news: Donte Quinine, a 6-6 swingman from Rowland Heights Rowland, 
has committed to Oregon, and 6-7 forward Peter Sauer of Pittsburgh has decided 
to attend Stanford. . . . California is still hoping to sign 6-6 forward Derek 
Hood of Kansas City, Mo., one of the top prospects in the country. Best bet is 
that Hood will commit to Arkansas, where he and his parents recently completed 
a weekend visit.

COLLEGE SOCCER; BRADBURY'S HEADER IN OVERTIME ENABLES TITANS TO TIE NOTRE DAME

 After defeating top-ranked Indiana Friday, Cal State Fullerton rallied twice 
to salvage a 2-2 tie with unranked Notre Dame Sunday at the UCLA/adidas MetLife 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bradbury headed in a crossing pass from Eddie Soto with five minutes to 
play in overtime to give the Titans (10-6-2) the tie.Five minutes earlier, 
Notre Dame (8-9-2) had taken a 2-1 lead on a goal by Tim Oates. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton won the tournament with a 1-0-1 record. Indiana, which beat UCLA, 
2-0, Sunday, each finished 1-1 in the tournament and Notre Dame was 0-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto sent the game into overtime with a goal on a penalty kick with 11 minutes 
left in regulation. After a scoreless first half, Notre Dame's Chris Dean 
scored in the 55th minute to give the Irish a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were playing without goalkeeper Mike Kornock and midfielder Joey 
Franchino, who were ineligible to play because they each received a red card in 
the victory over Indiana (17-2). Backup goalkeeper Justin Johnston had six 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next game, Indiana dominated the midfield and, as UCLA players became 
increasingly frustrated, play deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers scored in the 36th minute when Joel Shanker headed in a corner 
kick by Todd Yeagley. They scored again with 25 minutes remaining on an own 
goal by UCLA's Brian Woolfolk, who was trying to defend against a free kick by 
Yeagley and accidentally knocked it into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time UCLA (15-2) has been shut out since Oct. 9, 1992, when 
it lost to New Mexico, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto, Bradbury, Alfred Partida and Brad Wilson were named to the 
all-tournament team for Fullerton.

OFF THE TICKER: KIAM SHAVES $73,400 OFF BRITISH PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Kiam, owner of electric shaver maker Remington Corp., won $73,400 in 
libel damages from a British newspaper that said he had filed for bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based Sunday Times claimed in December, 1991, that Kiam was being 
sued by National Westminster Bank after defaulting on a $13.5-million loan he 
used to buy a U.S. football team, the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can now walk tall and say that they couldn't just wipe it off with an 
apology in the paper. . . . I have been vindicated in the British courts system 
and I stand now clean and pure," Kiam said after the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old businessman said the newspaper report, which had resulted from 
a researching error, had damaged his reputation and dogged his business 
dealings. He was forced to contact suppliers all over the world and his 
executives had to inform retailers that the newspaper report was not true.

 Question: I'm currently employed in a bagel shop and work about 84 hours a 
week. My basic pay is $4.35 an hour and I receive no overtime. My boss tells me 
that this is the way it is. Do I have any rights? 
</P>
<P>
 -- C.B., San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. Virtually every employer in California is subject to the 
Industrial Commission Welfare Orders, which require that employers pay 
non-exempt employees premium pay of 1 1/2 times their normal hourly rate for 
time worked in excess of eight hours daily or 40 hours weekly and twice their 
normal hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 12 daily, or in excess of 
eight on the seventh day worked in a workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that you are not an exempt employee, you are entitled to overtime 
compensation and may pursue a claim for it with the California Division of 
Labor Standards Enforcement. 
</P>

<P>
 Question: I was hired by a company for a salaried sales position with 
commissions and given a specific sales territory, which was five minutes from 
my home. The primary reason I left my old job was an excess amount of driving. 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks of training, I was told the territory I thought I would 
receive had been given to someone else, actually prior to my being hired. My 
new territory requires driving two hours each way. I don't know whether I have 
any rights in this matter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.F., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: An employer is liable if it misrepresents terms of employment to a 
prospective employee who relies on such statements to his or her detriment. If 
the employer knew that the promise of a certain territory was a material reason 
for you accepting this new job assignment, then failure to fulfill that promise 
constitutes breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If the employer knew at the time that the promise was made to you and that it 
had no intent to fulfill the promise, as it appears in your case, then the 
breach of contract might even amount to a fraud claim. Not only could you 
recover your out-of-pocket wage losses, but also punitive damages as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The key here is being able to prove that the promise was in fact made to you. 
If it is your word against the employer's word, that still may be good enough. 
It would be better if you could confirm it through a witness or a written 
document. Additionally, you need to be able to prove that the employer knew 
that the territory had been assigned to somebody else prior to you being hired 
and the representations being made to you. 
</P>
<P>
 You also will need to show that you adequately communicated to the employer 
that the specific assignment of territory was an important reason for you 
accepting the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The damages you suffered also affect the value of your claim. If your new job 
gives you substantially more pay than your old job despite the driving, then 
you might hesitate to complain too strongly to your employer. However, if the 
main difference is simply the extent of the driving, then consider your ability 
to find a replacement job before threatening your employer with legal action.

<P>
 Question: If an employee works a 40-hour workweek and is then required to work 
four to six hours on Saturday, is it legal for an employer to refuse to pay 
overtime and insist that the employee take time off during the following week? 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.M., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Generally, an employer may not require an employee to take time off in 
place of overtime pay. In certain circumstances, an employee may choose to 
forgo overtime pay in favor of time off. Under a fairly recent provision of 
state law, any such arrangements must be in writing.

<P>
 Question: I'm a 60-year-old hourly employee of a large corporation and I'm 
being terminated under a restructuring plan. My 13 years of service leave me 
about 18 months shy of the necessary points to be awarded early retirement pay. 
Can I successfully sue to receive early retirement? 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.K., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Probably not. The mere fact that you do not qualify for severance pay 
under the rules of your employer's severance pay plan does not give you any 
basis for a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you can prove that you were chosen for termination 
specifically because you are not eligible for early retirement -- as opposed to 
some neutral, legitimate reason -- you may have a claim under Section 510 of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which prohibits employers from 
terminating employees to prevent them from obtaining retirement benefits. 
However, such a claim could be quite difficult to prove. It will not be enough 
to show that most of the people laid off were not eligible for early 
retirement, since most companies will seek to lay off less senior employees 
first, and less senior employees are usually further away from retirement age.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: OVERWORKED AND UNDERPAID? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES BATES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Gates may be the richest person in America, but is he also one of the 
most underpaid? 
</P>
<P>
 The latest "Crystal Report" newsletter from San Rafael-based executive 
compensation expert Graef S. (Bud) Crystal lists the Microsoft Corp. founder 
and chief executive as underpaid to the tune of about $5.4 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal came to that conclusion by comparing how well Microsoft performed for 
its shareholders versus the $418,000 in direct compensation Gates received. 
Gates ranked 192nd among CEOs of the 200 largest companies in Crystal's 
compensation comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that was better than the 194th ranking given Berkshire Hathaway 
Chairman Warren E. Buffett, Gates' close friend and fellow billionaire. Crystal 
estimated that Buffett was underpaid by $6.18 million when he compared how 
Berkshire Hathaway did with Buffett's $305,000 in direct compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that either executive is hurting for cash. Forbes magazine recently 
estimated that Gates, who just turned 39 on Friday, has built up a nest egg of 
at least $9.35 billion, largely through his Microsoft stock holdings. That 
comes to more than $650,000 accumulated for every day he's been alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine lists Buffett in second among America's richest, with $9.2 
billion. But No 800 Number to Call 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Brown is about to find out if California's real estate market is still 
in an era of limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The former California governor and presidential candidate has just listed his 
San Francisco home -- a 101-year-old converted fire station in the fashionable 
Pacific Heights section -- for $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The home is described by officials at San Francisco-based McGuire Real Estate, 
which is marketing the home as having about 3,600 square feet, although that 
includes a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The home has only one bedroom, but there is a studio in the back that could be 
converted into a guest house. 
</P>
<P>
 It also features 10-foot high entrances, ceilings as high as 14 feet, a bell 
tower and two fire poles. A flagpole sits in front with a mailbox attached to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown bought the house five years ago. No word on where he's moving. Used to 
Court Appearances 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in the federal criminal trial of former Columbia Savings & Loan 
Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel last week was Kenneth Heitz, former chief 
attorney for the now-defunct Beverly Hills thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitz was well known in Los Angeles in the late 1960s as a UCLA basketball 
star who played on three of Coach John Wooden's national championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitz played alongside legendary basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known 
then as Lew Alcindor, who, until 1992, held the school's all-time scoring 
record for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before beginning his cross-examination last Friday in the Los Angeles trial, 
Spiegel attorney Brad Brian said to Heitz: "Let me ask the questions that 
everyone is dying to know: Which UCLA teams did you play for, and were you the 
top scorer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heitz said he played for the Bruins from 1965 to 1969. "That was the team 
(that) Kareem played for," Heitz said, "which I think answers your second 
question."

JACK SMITH: 'WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF ROMANCE?' IT'S AT THE CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I drove to Riverside the other day to visit Air Force Village 
West, a place I had not heard of until I received an invitation from a 
resident, Christine Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson suggested we arrive at 3:30 in the afternoon, so we would have time 
to be shown around before dinner. Not knowing how long the drive would take we 
allowed plenty of time, intending to have lunch on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 We looked for a place to stop, but Riverside County can be rather desolate. We 
took Highway 60 to Highway 215 and finally turned into an off-the-road place 
that looked like a restaurant. It was a welding shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally we came to a place called Box Springs and decided it must support some 
civilized amenities. We turned off and found ourselves at a Shell gas station. 
No restaurant was in sight, but my wife noticed that the station had one of 
those little stores that sell sandwiches and bottled drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 She parked the car, went into the store and came out with Cokes and sandwiches 
in plastic boxes. She moved the car to a shady spot and we began to eat our 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a couple of nights earlier we had been on the way to an event at the 
Screen Writers Guild, and having too little time to stop for dinner, we had 
picked up two fat sandwiches and Cokes at a sub shop. We ate the sandwiches 
while my wife was driving and arrived in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner in a moving car is not exactly haute cuisine, but it is part of life in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really class," I said as I munched a ham and cheese at the Shell 
station and sipped Coke through a straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's your sense of romance?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a shed 50 yards or so ahead of us with an open door under a sign 
that said "Entrance." It was a carwash.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to get the car washed?' my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean while we're eating lunch in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's your sense of humor?" 
</P>
<P>
 I had to go to the men's room. It turned out to be next door to the carwash. 
The door was open with a broom angled across it. An attendant appeared. He said 
"You can use that one," pointing to the next door women's room. I went to the 
women's room while my wife stood guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the man told her that the carwash was free for customers. You had to 
have a ticket. My wife went to get a ticket and came back and we got in the 
car. She headed for the carwash. It was automatic. You drove in over a button 
and it started up. 
</P>
<P>
 We were enveloped in the dark shed and suddenly water sprayed us from all 
sides. Then we were surrounded by thrashing strips of chamois like Satan's 
tongues. I was gripped by claustrophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 In our shining car we reached the clubhouse of Air Force Village West, a 
nonprofit corporation. Thompson and others were waiting for us.  
</P>
<P>
 Don Green, a resident, put me in his car and we began to tour the village. My 
wife was taken in another car. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Village West was started in 1989 by Gen. Curtis E. LeMay and other 
retired officers on 153 acres of surplus land purchased from March Air Force 
Base. It now numbers about 400 dwellings with about 500 residents -- retired 
officers and their spouses, or widows. 
</P>
<P>
 Green drove me through the village past blocks of terra cotta houses with red 
tile roofs. The houses were similar to one another but no house was exactly 
like its next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 We drove along streets named after Arnold, LeMay, Spaatz, Twining and other 
famous flying officers. The houses sat behind aprons of green lawn. At one 
point we crossed the path of 10 or 12 people in wheelchairs, disabled residents 
on an outing. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I noticed the various public rooms were spotless. No dust. No 
trash. Bouquets of fresh flowers everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 The village has all the amenities of country club living, plus a skilled 
nursing center for those residents who need care. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an excellent library, especially strong on military subjects. All its 
books were donated by residents. The facilities also include a beauty and 
barber shop, billiard room, bridge club, cable television, golf, gun club, 
needlework, swimming pool, tennis courts and a watercolor class.  
</P>
<P>
 Before dining we went into a bar, where I refreshed myself with a vodka tonic. 
In the intimate dining room, I had red snapper and white wine. My dinner 
companions were charming. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed the best of all possible worlds, especially for retired officers and 
spouses who may be a little weary of the metropolitan rush and crush. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home we bypassed Box Springs, but we'll always remember that 
romantic interlude.

 What's scary? 
</P>
<P>
 One reader sent a Paris fashion-show photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another wrote, "Here is my scary story: Quayle-Huffington '96." Still another: 
"Scary? The reelection of Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 But what strikes real fear in the hearts and minds of Southern Californians? 
For the editors of Life & Style, it was the 3,348 entries in our second annual 
Scariest Halloween Story Ever Told Contest. Imagine picking just eight winners 
-- seven stories and one drawing -- from that avalanche of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is scary? A few other thoughts from the febrile imaginations of 
the 3,340 other folks who had us howling: 
</P>
<P>
 * The terrors of freeway driving inspired several stories, including one in 
which a rude driver gets it from an avenging ghost with a car phone and a white 
Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 * In another, a wave of mysterious deaths turns out to be caused by O.J. 
Simpson trial-coverage overload. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a story by a sixth-grader, Mike's grandparents stage a gory prank to 
teach him a lesson. It works. The story ends: "The only problem is, that 
happened 10 years ago and Mike is still in therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 You want frightening? Stories from younger -- and older -- writers included 
such scintillating similes as "he was sweating like Niagara Falls" and 
"raindrops the size of water balloons." 
</P>
<P>
 Creative spellings had us shivering, too, including groosem, unconchis, a 
bazaar phenomenon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the terrors grown-ups just don't understand, such as when a 
kid turns in his test paper just before the bell -- then realizes his numbering 
for the answers is out of sequence. Or when a child all primed for a Halloween 
candy pig-out gets snowed in for five days with nothing to eat but canned 
broccoli and Brussels sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The most touching scary story had no ghosts, no gore, no cobwebby old house. A 
teen-ager tells of fleeing her native Vietnam at the age of 10, relating how it 
felt to leave her parents behind, to spend days on a crowded boat and run out 
of food and water, to watch others die at sea, and now to enjoy freedom and 
school in a new country while deeply missing the old one.

 Politics, law and disorder: Comedy writer Peyser reports that a recent survey

 Last Halloween night, reader Bob Aguirre of Inglewood answered the door, 
expecting the usual "trick-or-treat" chant. Instead, a three-foot clown peered 
up at him with soulful eyes and a bag nearly as big as the little tyke. From 
the sidewalk, a voice called out, "What do you tell the man, honey?" Eyes still 
fixed on him, the boy said:

<P>
 Whenever I think about the O.J. Simpson case, there's something I feel beyond 
the sadness and disgust elicited by the media frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a feeling beyond the loathing that occurs whenever the discussion sinks 
to clothing styles worn by the lawyers, or the nausea that wells up whenever I 
must run the gantlet of tabloid exposes at the supermarket checkout line. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the dread at what new disclosures might be lurking. Or the weariness at the 
sheer length of the proceedings. The other emotion has seethed in me every day 
of the four months since the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 That emotion is outrage. A vague outrage, the most painful and wrenching kind, 
because it cannot find a focus, and therefore it tends to regress inside, where 
it tears at me. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrage is what I feel any time I, the father of two daughters, contemplate 
the kind of society we live in, where women are so frequently at risk. It is 
certainly what I felt last month, when the family of Nicole Brown Simpson was 
interviewed by Diane Sawyer on ABC's "Prime Time Live." 
</P>
<P>
 There, displayed for the whole country to see, were the grainy, utterly 
familiar home movie images: A young girl, beautiful and happy, cavorting with 
her family, playing the aspiring dancer, smiling for the camera, her life -- by 
all appearances -- full of love and promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I have filmed my daughters in hundreds of similar moments. 
Reliving their childhood in this way has always been pleasant for me. 
</P>
<P>
 This time was different. I wasn't watching one of my children, but someone 
else's -- Louis Brown's daughter, Nicole, who was brutally murdered one evening 
in June. And so instead of nostalgia and tenderness, my heart was filled with 
sadness, dread -- and outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched that particular program because I wanted to see Louis Brown. I 
wanted to see him and I wanted to hear his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this whole sorry spectacle began, I have thought a lot about what it 
means to see my two beloved daughters, my little angels now full-grown women, 
enter this society within which lurk predatory, brutal men. The prospect makes 
me extremely angry. 
</P>
<P>
 I see with alarming frequency how children like mine -- like Nicole -- can be 
taken in an instant of animal, inhuman rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Brown has experienced the loss of a child, a tragedy intensified 
unimaginably by how she was killed. Yet this quiet, gentle man showed no rage, 
only great dignity, to the TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 I could only shudder as I watched. There are many beasts out there. That's 
why, in this society, women can face far greater danger from their boyfriends, 
lovers and husbands than from strangers. No father's daughter is safe from 
them. The child in the home movies, displayed for millions to see, could have 
been one of mine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's extremely frightening and sad. But there's something worse, something 
that fills me with guilt as well as anger: As men, we tolerate these monsters. 
We may deny it, but we know who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not speak out against them with nearly enough forcefulness and 
conviction, so that the societal message is clear: Cruelty and mistreatment of 
women is unacceptable, despicable -- and unmanly -- behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there is acquiescence and even tacit approval. I have seen it since I 
was in grammar school. That's when I started noticing the words used to 
represent women -- specifically, parts of women's anatomy. At first, I heard 
them uttered by adults. Eventually, they were copied by my classmates. I spoke 
them too. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the beginning of a process that reduces women from fully dimensional 
human beings into sexual gratification apparatuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, the preoccupation became touching those body parts. We 
compared the process to baseball. ("I got to second base with Margaret last 
night.") The quest continued, until "sliding into home" was achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of us, fortunately, a maturing process also managed to creep in. 
Somehow a human being was finally perceived as attached to those body parts. 
The woman grew a head and a brain. The idea of sexual adventure emerged as a 
two-way street. The woman grew arms and hands, so she, too, could hold and 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, however, maturity never happened. They proceeded along a darker 
path, never acknowledging women as having value beyond sex. The concept of body 
parts remained, never to be relinquished. Sex was something you did, not 
shared. It was symbolized by that now-ubiquitous four-letter word. Normal and 
healthy sexual desire was perverted into a form of hatred and self-loathing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All men know this, as I do, because when you are an adult male in the company 
of males, you hear what some men say and see how they can behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Like my first college summer, working at a construction job, sitting with 
co-workers during lunch, listening to them, day after day, describe various 
women they knew solely in sexually pejorative terms. Never, ever, was a women 
referred to as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, several years later, listening to an oil company executive in a New York 
hotel bar tell my editor and me how he had begged off sharing a hooker with a 
couple of his colleagues the previous evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Morality? Fidelity to his wife? (He wore a large wedding band.) No. He 
complained that the woman's breasts were too big. Sex with her, he said, would 
be like "(fornicating with) a goddamn balloon!" 
</P>
<P>
 His lament, uttered with a hideous guffaw, fills me with revulsion to this 
day. What could married life possibly have been like with that guy? What kind 
of example was he to his sons? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, very recently, talking on a street corner with some business associates 
and seeing the conversation come to a dead stop while they ogled a young woman 
walking by. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not innocent of similar behavior. Yes, I look. Sometimes I share off-color 
jokes with friends. And I certainly don't claim to understand or speak for the 
female experience. But in the process of growing up, with the advice and strong 
example of my father, I learned to respect women, to treat them as human 
beings, and never to act in a way for a woman to fear me. 
</P>
<P>
 And when I became a father, I added protectiveness to my behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many other men hold these values as well. Many young men manage to grow up 
with respect and affection for women. One who comes immediately to mind is 
probably going to become my son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 But as men in this society, we do not do enough to instill sensitivity in all 
our fellows. As a result, some turn into monsters. Individuals who joke about 
body parts will also attack the owners of those body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the big deal?" I've heard them say. "The bitch got a little sassy so I 
had to slap her around." Just like in the movies. Only for real. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, the batterer's pathetic refrain: "I can't help myself, she just gets to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The behavior is nothing new. It has been going on for thousands of years. The 
difference is that we are supposed to be civilized now. Yet many men aren't. 
These beasts roam the streets instead of the savannah. They infest every corner 
of society, from boardrooms to barrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 And fathers of daughters live in constant fear of the horrors that can be 
wrought by other fathers' sons. 
</P>
<P>
 As men in this society, we do not do enough to instill sensitivity in all our 
</P>
<P>
 fellows. As a result, some turn into monsters. Individuals who joke about body 
parts will also attack the owners of those body parts.

COMMITMENTS: SEEKING LOVE'S FORTUNE; IT WAS CURIOSITY REALLY, BUT MAYBE A 
PSYCHIC WOULD KNOW. HAD SHE MARRIED THE RIGHTMAN? AFTER FOUR READINGS, SHE KNEW 
SHE HAD THE ANSWER. 
</P>

<P>
 Our marriage enjoys the tranquillity of a peacetime truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, we have agreed to friendly nation status. But border skirmishes do 
arise from time to time, followed by sanctions, otherwise known as the silent 
treatment. This lasts until one of us decides to wave the white flag and the 
peace treaty is again signed, honored and revered. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy and all that other Cinderella hullabaloo enters into our marriage only as 
a byproduct of respect and compromise. War metaphors and fairy tales 
notwithstanding, we have had the good fortune of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 So why screw it up with crystal balls, hazy auras and Tarot cards? Because 
curiosity gotthe best of me. If I had done the right thing by getting married 
to this man, then a psychic was sure to know. But if, on the other hand, I had 
made a mistake, I felt it my responsibility to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 I searched through the Yellow Pages under "Psychic" but was referred to 
"Spiritual Consultants." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course! What was I thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 There were several to choose from: "European Master Clairvoyant," "Egyptian 
Psychic," "America's Native Psychic." One of the ads offered house calls. 
Another, inexplicably, pictured a Star of David superimposed over a menorah. 
Most showed crystal balls and beautiful women adorned in hoop earrings and 
scarves. 
</P>
<P>
 I chose a psychic who promised to answer all my love questions. She was in 
Beverly Hills, which seemed an appropriate place to start since this region of 
Planet Los Angeles has always subscribed to its own cosmic set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 My psychic greeted me at the door of her tiny apartment with a portable phone 
stuck to her ear and gruffly motioned for me to sit down at the kitchen table. 
Then she left me there for several minutes while she whispered hotly into the 
phone in the adjacent room. Urgent matters concerning past lives, no doubt. 
When she returned, she sat down and instructed me to shuffle the deck of Tarot 
cards while I concentrated on my deepest desires and my most hidden fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In a town where no one goes five feet without a cellular phone and Hollywood 
deals are made over plates of pasta, I was surprised that there was to be no 
schmoozing with my psychic. 
</P>
<P>
 She plunged into the reading with nary a preamble, flipping cards with 
maddening haste while she predicted what fortunes would enter my life. She 
quickly dispensed with the standard predictions: I'll be rich, I'll sign an 
important document, I'll travel somewhere exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 But essentially, I was going to be meeting dozens of men: men from my past, 
men at weddings, older men with lots of money. Even a dead man who served as my 
spirit guide, although I would never really know his true identity. The only 
mention of a woman had to do with a red-haired friend who would betray me. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for sisterhood. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to say anything to her, but this hardly resembled my life. 
Basically, I know four men: my husband, my dad and my two bothers. When I have 
free time, I spend it with my girlfriends. As for some wizened old dead guy as 
my protector, I have to confess that when I believe in it, I tend to lean 
toward angels as my guardians. When she had finished with the reading, the 
psychic told me to pick three cards and ask a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about my marriage?" I demanded.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," she said. She seemed surprised -- hardly a response I would have 
expected from a psychic. "You're married?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her response was emphatic, sudden, slightly embarrassed. "I see a separation," 
she said. Then she looked at her watch. "Anything else?" 
</P>
<P>
 I shook my head no. 
</P>
<P>
 "That'll be $35," she said and showed me to the door. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment I stood outside in front of the glitzy storefronts of Beverly 
Hills, feeling much like Dorothy must have felt during those first few seconds 
in Oz. How did I get here? 
</P>
<P>
 My psychic couldn't have been further from the truth regarding my life, 
although I have to admit to enjoying that fleeting fantasy of all those future 
men. If anything, she was adept at fostering hope -- for single women perhaps 
-- but it didn't apply to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to go for a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 As I drove aimlessly through the urban madness of the Fairfax District, I 
stumbled onto my second psychic. I was drawn to the mixed metaphors displayed 
proudly in her gallery window. A Sphinx, a Merlin doll, a crystal ball. From 
behind a curtain, which presumably led to her living quarters, I heard an "I 
Love Lucy" rerun blaring from a television set and the voices of small 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 My psychic greeted me cheerfully in the gallery while her two kids ran out 
into the street, tore down the Merlin doll, grabbed for my keys and began to 
cry hysterically. She apologized and took hold of my hands while a man came 
from behind the curtain and retrieved the little brats. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the first one, this psychic mentioned that I would soon be signing an 
important paper, that I would get rich in the near future and that I should 
expect to travel somewhere distant. But she was more specific: I'd be going to 
Spain, China or Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she got right down to the nitty gritty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your aura is filthy," she informed me. "You're surrounded by negativity." 
</P>
<P>
 I was shocked. This was like going to the mechanic for a broken radiator hose 
and finding out you need a new transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wanted to find out about my relationship," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, don't worry about that," she said. "You guys are made for each other." 
She then closed her eyes and squeezed my hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could get to the bottom of your negativity. Your aura is real pale." 
</P>
<P>
 "But what about my husband? Did I marry the right guy?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys are soul mates, I tell you," she said. She seemed a little 
irritated, as if she were tired of stating the obvious. "But, listen, I could 
clear up that negativity for an additional $70." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ideclined the offer and high-tailed it out of there. Something wasn't right. 
They both said the same things about money, travel and my signature. But in 
matters concerning love, they were diametrically opposed. Maybe I had just 
turned to the wrong psychics. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Venice Beach, land of the inscrutable, home of the slightly sleazy, 
gallery of life's shady underbelly was where the more practiced seers dwell. 
They seemed to congregate there at any rate. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sauntered down the boardwalk, dodging big dogs and kamikaze skateboarders 
sporting Nazi tattoos, I stumbled onto a kindly psychic who greeted me with an 
almost toothless smile and warm blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You married your best friend," she said. I fell into her smooth voice like I 
would a feather bed. "He loves you very, very much. He has a big heart. But you 
two have a long, rocky road ahead of you. This is because of your past life. 
See this?" she said. She pointed to one of the cards, a picture of a cup with 
conical shapes, like icicles falling into it. 
</P>
<P>
 She nodded knowingly. "Uh huh," she said, as if I had given any indication at 
all that I'd derived meaning from the card. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she proceeded to ask me some embarrassing personal details involving our 
sex life, which for some reason I felt obliged to answer. My answers seemed to 
surprise her, given the fact that my "lower chakras weren't in order." I was 
too afraid to ask her what a chakra was. It all sounded vaguely unsavory, even 
though I later learned they had to do with "energy centers." 
</P>
<P>
 It was precisely these chakras that stood in the way of total happiness for me 
and my husband. And for a small fee, she could clear up the problem. When I 
declined, she lost interest in me. I paid her the basic rate of $15 and left. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By now, I realized that I was no closer to the answer than when I had started, 
even though I had unwittingly uncovered several problems related to my various 
energy centers, all of which, miraculously, could be cleared up for a "small 
additional fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Any sane person might have stopped right there and done something more 
conventional like go to Palm Desert and uncover the truth in a honeymoon suite. 
But no one has ever accused me of being sane. 
</P>
<P>
 In a desperate move I made one last attempt to discover whether or not, 
according to the mystical world of stars, planets and Tarot cards, I had 
married the right guy. The minute I got home, I dialed a 900 number where for 
$2.99 a minute I was guaranteed my own "spiritual consultant." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, she told me that we were on a 12-minute timer and if we were 
disconnected, I shouldn't take it personally. I told her I could handle that. 
</P>
<P>
 While the psychic computer ran my and my husband's compatibility chart in the 
background, using the extremely scientific data of our birth dates, places of 
birth and how late we would sleep if we didn't have to work, my psychic warned 
me that I should make extra allowances for my relationship next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that Mars is in Cancer next month, right?" she asked worriedly. 
</P>
<P>
 As if this meant anything to me. 
</P>
<P>
 She then continued by telling me that even though the stars showed a marital 
breakup, I'd nevertheless have a marriage of permanency. 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-month long-range forecast in which, among other things (and not 
surprisingly), I would make a lot of money, sign an important document and 
travel someplace far away, my psychic informed me that the computer had 
finished the compatibility chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, dear. Your compatibility chart says. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Click. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone went dead. 
</P>
<P>
 For a wild moment I contemplated calling back. But then it occurred to me that 
I'd reached the end of the road as far as my astral travels were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 I had just completed four sessions with four psychics in which I discovered 
only one truth: There was no truth unless I needed to believe in one. But the 
fact is, when all was said and done, all I ever needed to do was ask myself 
three questions: Who is my best friend, whom do I trust most in the world and, 
above all else, who would I share my winning Lotto ticket with? 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't need a psychic to tell me the answer is my husband. For us, an 
occasional border skirmish is never really a serious threat, especially since 
he and I have always loved a good peace treaty.

RSVP; A POWER LUNCH WITH HILLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You could forget lunch at Cicada or The Ivy on Friday. The power lunch was 
surely the Hollywood Women's Political Committee fund-raiser with a lineup of 
speakers that went, in order of appearance: Barbra, Whoopi, Hillary. If you 
need last names, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 A paparazzi's field day, the event -- a fund-raiser for progressive Democratic 
House and Senate candidates -- drew female forces in front of and behind the 
screen, including Shirley MacLaine, Liza Minnelli, Lynda Guber, Lili Fini 
Zanuck, Marlee Matlin, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Natalie Cole, Laura Ziskin, Linda 
Bruckheimer, Lisa Henson, Linda Gray and Jane Semel.  
</P>
<P>
 There was even a smattering of evolved men, such as actor Ron Silver squiring 
Tawny Little, State Democratic Committee chairman Bill Press and MCA president 
Sidney Sheinberg, with his wife, Lorraine, and sons Jon and Bill.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an equal opportunity lunch," quipped Sheinberg.  
</P>
<P>
 But even for these seasoned schmoozers, mingling was a nightmare. The table at 
which First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Whoopi Goldberg 
sat during the cold chicken lunch was encircled by a red velvet rope that gave 
the strong impression running up and embracing any of them was not a good idea. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of nearly a thousand had been alerted to arrive a half-hour later 
than planned because of Clinton's schedule and then patiently stood another 
half-hour outside the Regent Beverly Wilshire for the final security check of 
the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized it wasn't, but this wasn't exactly like waiting for a diva doing her 
final mascara check. Clinton came directly from the Middle East where she 
witnessed the signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty. It was a 20-hour 
journey. "I am tired," allowed Clinton when she fumbled over her words once 
during a lengthy, otherwise awesome, unscripted oratorial performance.  
</P>
<P>
 Touching on feminism, reactionary politics, health care reform ("We will get 
it"), the treaty signing ("I was so proud of our President"), and "the 
balancing act" of modern women's lives, Clinton also pumped up the room over 
the upcoming election and her support of gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown 
(who was present) and Senate candidate Dianne Feinstein (who wasn't).  
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to think we'll do quite well," said Clinton of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 While Streisand spoke at length, reading a speech in which she praised 
President Clinton's accomplishments and jabbed at Republican Senate candidate 
Michael Huffington, Goldberg spoke more from another place in the heart. With 
Mrs. Clinton as a national role model, Goldberg said: "Suddenly it was OK for 
women to be articulate and outspoken and OK to be called a bitch for it."

RSVP; ROYALTY, CELEBRITIES AT 'OSCARS OF CHARITY BALLS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a gala where Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn 
and Dustin Hoffman are seated for dinner. This, however, isn't the table 
drawing stares. That's because dining together nearby are First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, Duchess of York Sarah (Fergie) Ferguson, Barbra Streisand, 
Steven Spielberg, Kate Capshaw, Placido Domingo, Rita Wilson, Tom Hanks and 
Gov. Pete Wilson with his wife, Gayle. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the eye-popping turnout of society's powerful and glitzy that makes 
Marvin and Barbara Davis' biennial Carousel of Hope ball for diabetes 
charities, held Friday at the Beverly Hilton, L.A.'s most mesmerizing 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Oscars of charity balls," said Lee Minnelli, who came with 
stepdaughter Liza. "Barbara has created a miracle. She's made the most 
glamorous ball in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening began with a silent auction chaired by Dana and Nancy Davis that 
included everything from a Jack Russell terrier to a week-long trip on Isaac 
Tigrett's private, 1928 railway car. While the 1,269 guests bid, VIPs -- 
including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Jackie Collins, Quincy 
Jones, David Geffen, Mary Tyler Moore and Chevy Chase -- mingled in an adjacent 
room.  
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic First Lady and the Republican California governor were there as 
well, though they weren't rubbing elbows. Their body language throughout the 
evening were like those of parents -- who've endured an icy divorce -- 
attending their child's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-dinner receptions ended 45 minutes later than expected and it was 9 
p.m. before the long parade of tuxedoed men and designer-gowned women were 
seated. "This is definitely not the night for a little black dress," observed 
Nancy Davis. "This is when you crack the vault, break out the jewels and put on 
the real ball gown." 
</P>
<P>
 One fashion rule was: the younger the woman, the blacker and sleeker the 
dress. In the First Lady's case, she wore a long-sleeved, fitted at the waist, 
floor-length black-knit gown over a silk chiffon slip. It was set off by a 
simple diamond necklace. 
</P>
<P>
 As this fashion caravan entered the International Ballroom, it found a scene 
dominated by the ball's pink colors. Seated by the stage near Rod Stewart, Paul 
Marciano, Lod Cook, Wayne Gretzky, Ron Perlman and Patricia Duff was author 
Gore Vidal. He said he came to the gala because "I was recently told by my 
doctor that I am a senile diabetic." Vidal paused for full ironic effect. "The 
least I could do," he added dryly, "is show solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
 Before dinner was served, there were brief speeches by Barbara Davis, who 
focused on the work of her Denver-based Barbara Davis Center for Childhood 
Diabetes, which will receive most of the $6 million raised, and by Marvin 
Davis, whose voice cracked when he spoke about his daughter Dana's struggle to 
preserve her eyesight against diabetes.

 The dinner of roast chicken with morel sauce (which Beverly Hilton owner Merv 
Griffin underwrote) was barely off the tables when Kenny G, who had been 
practicing scales in the men's room, made his way through the tables playing 
impossibly long notes on his soprano saxophone. "The toughest part was dodging 
the waiters," said G. 
</P>
<P>
 For producer George Schlatter, the toughest part was shoehorning a speech by 
Sidney Poitier and performances by G, Jay Leno, Placido Domingo, Natalie Cole, 
Neil Diamond and Phil Collins into the allotted time. "It's one thing to ask 
them for the favor of performing," he said. "It's another thing to ask them for 
a short favor."

 Hanks, who affectionately congratulated the President for his Middle East 
mission ("Bubba did good"), presented the Brass Ring Award to the First Lady. 
Her first words were, "Tom, Bubba is as Bubba does." She went on to note how 
difficult it is for families without health insurance to deal financially with 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the guests departed they were each given two large canvas gift bags, one 
each from Revlon and Guess. One guest said the satchels were so large the crowd 
"looks like they're going through customs." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those departing were Anne and Frank Johnson, Wendy and Leonard Goldberg, 
Bob Daly and Carole Bayer Sager, Betsy Bloomingdale, David Foster, Shirley 
MacLaine, Steve Tisch, David Foster, Cynthia and Bud Yorkin, Lili and Dick 
Zanuck, Margie and Jerry Perenchio, Danny DeVito and Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most discerning observation on celebrities in the departing throng 
came from Robin Ruzan, who is Mike Myer's wife. She looked at the famous faces 
and said, "I keep thinking they're celebrity look-alikes. It's like they can't 
all be here."

 She had been growing a Manchurian mushroom in a bowl in the bathtub and 
drinking the fermented juice it produced for her health. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned after a week's vacation, she found the faucet had dripped, 
giving the mushroom extra moisture.To her horror, she saw the mushroom had 
grown to gargantuan size and was slipping its slimy body over the edge of the 
tub. 
</P>
<P>
 She stood among the myriad vitamin bottles and thought of the many health 
products she had taken because "they were good for her." The creature seemed to 
look at her from spots on its body that appeared to be eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, all the vitamins, health food and fermented juice reacted and 
she vaporized. Her last thought was of a mountain of broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
 Without her care, the creature died and only a slime was found in and around 
the tub. There was no trace of her -- no body for the coroner. The only things 
that remained were her tennis shoes with the arch support inserts. It was 
labeled a mysterious disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, if only she had eaten chocolate.

 Sammy ran through the dark, thick forest, feeling the creature's hot, musky 
breath on the back of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave me alone!" shouted Sammy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy started running faster. He thought he was gaining a bigger lead. Then, 
just as he thought he saw the city through the thick fog, he tripped over a 
root. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned around and the last thing he saw was Dracula's hairy palms reaching 
for him before he woke up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy sat bolt upright in bed, sweat pouring off his brow. It was just a 
nightmare! It must have come from the great description from his best friend, 
Erik: "Dracula has yellow slits for eyes, black rings around his eyes, and an 
exaggerated widow's peak. But the most scary thing about him are his hairy 
palms." 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy relaxed. It was only a dream. Then he saw the window. It was broken and 
there was a piece of black cloth hanging off it. He looked at the cloth. It was 
made of silk. The only things Sammy knew of that were made of silk were ties, 
boxers and those antique capes his grandma had. Nanna said they were from 
Transylvania. But his Nanna hadn't been at this house since last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no, Dracula must have been real," thought Sammy. 
</P>
<P>
 That night Sammy slept with a cross in his hand and garlic all over his room. 
The trouble was, he really didn't remember his dream anymore. Actually, the 
more he thought about it, the sillier it sounded. Dracula coming to get him at 
night and making him believe it was all a dream. Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day Sammy had to wear sunglasses all day. The sun was hurting his 
eyes terribly. He also got sunburned all over his face and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to sleep that night without any "vampire protection." This time, when 
he had his nightmare, Dracula almost got him. 
</P>
<P>
 When he woke up, there were paw prints going out of his room, down the stairs 
and out of the house. They looked like dog prints. 
</P>
<P>
 At school, he wore 45 SPF sun block. He got a sunburn anyway. He also was very 
tired. Mrs. Jones, his math teacher, had said he looked very pale. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy went to bed with a cross hung over his bed that night. It took him four 
hours to get to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sammy finally did get to sleep, he had the same nightmare. Only this 
time, Dracula caught up with him. As the vampire lord's teeth sunk into his 
neck, Sammy felt hair where Dracula gripped his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy woke up screaming, bringing his mother running to his room. Sammy felt 
his neck and felt two small pinholes. He looked at his hands and saw a soft, 
black fur starting to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sammy, my baby, are you all right?" asked his mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it was just a nightmare. But I'm really thirsty." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'll get you some water." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Mom, not water. Come here and I'll show you what I want."

 Emily took a glass jar with her into the woods. She had pounded nails through 
the lid so the insect she caught could breathe. She didn't really want to kill 
anything, especially just for a creepy science project. The sun was just going 
down over the trees, the last lingering fingers of light beckoning to her 
through the dead branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rats," she said, when she realized it was getting so late. She wished she had 
started this part of the project earlier because it was due tomorrow and she 
had to be ready at 6 for her dance recital. At least she knew her part for the 
dance. Her costume was ready for her to jump into and take her part in "The 
Waltz of the Flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Now she wished she had brought a better flashlight. It was going to be hard to 
see any insect she could use to illustrate its body structure now that the sun 
was going. Aha! Maybe a spider? she thought. 
</P>
<P>
 She could just make out a web coming up along the trail, glistening as it 
caught the last rays of light. Woven between two trees, the web was above head 
level and the spider had caught plenty of other insects too. "Wow! It's Bugs R 
Us!" There was no time to do anything but take the whole thing and stuff it 
into the jar. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily knew she'd have to use everything she knew about jumping -- skills 
learned and practiced in ballet -- to get it. She bent her knees in plie and 
leaped into the air. The jump was short. She tried backing up for a running 
start. She took three great strides forward, kicked her right foot in front of 
her, brought her left into the air and her arms reached above her head for the 
web as she turned in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 This time she brought the web down to the ground with her and, in doing so, 
pulled the branches the spider had connected with his web along with her. 
Having twisted in the process of getting the web, it had wrapped around her. 
The white lace was draped on her dark jacket, which created a gloomy pattern in 
the ever-darkening forest. 
</P>
<P>
 She struggled to get the web, filled with dead bugs and, as she now saw, bugs 
still struggling to escape, off her coat and into the jar. The web was a lot 
stronger than she thought it should have been, and as she lifted the now-filled 
jar up to the last light in the small clearing over her head, she drew in her 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily saw her own face reflected in the jar from a luminescence within -- the 
glowing red face of a huge spider, heaving, as if in anger, anchoring his hairy 
black legs against the sides of the jar as if to break the glass with the sheer 
pressure of his body. She clapped the lid on and screwed it tight, dropped it 
in her backpack and started running for home. 
</P>
<P>
 As she ran along the path, she felt her bag become heavier on her back. It 
just must be that I'm getting tired of running, she thought. But after another 
10 feet, she heard the breaking of glass. She flung the backpack from her and 
witnessed the spider, now a full foot in diameter -- the size of a cat -- 
struggle out of the nylon and bite through the straps as his head still glowed. 
</P>
<P>
 He was already ahead of her on the path and she knew from science class how 
spiders can jump. She reached for the bag and her flashlight, now covered with 
sticky white web, but her wrist became entangled and the bag stuck to the 
ground. The spider, now the size of a Weber Kettle, started after her. He ran 
up her tethered arm and spread his gooey web over her mouth first to gag her 
screams. By the time he had enclosed her in white, there were no more screams. 
</P>
<P>
 "There," he intoned in spider talk. "Now I have a specimen for my class. And a 
good jumper too!"

 Even though Ricky was only 7, he always seemed to know what people were 
thinking. When his father came home from work angry, Ricky was always waiting 
with a special drawing for him. And when Molly was fighting tears because that 
bully down the hill had called her "fatty," Ricky somehow knew to find her and 
slip his hand into hers.  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone thought Ricky was special, called him "amazing, really." Even Johnny 
had a particular tender spot for his little towheaded brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky adored his family too, and he especially loved the big family outings to 
the stream or the picnic field. He was always the first one out of bed on 
outing day. But not this day. He didn't care for the excursion. It was just 
over to the pine forest, where Dad had planned to chop the winter's firewood. 
Johnny liked to go along and practice his axmanship. Even Molly thought she'd 
tag along and help. Ricky loved to see his Dad work, see the capable hands do 
things that only strong men can do. But still, he didn't like to see those 
trees fall -- or hear them plead for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew this about Ricky, but he could hear trees talk. Oh, not in words, 
but in sounds that had meaning. He could hear them growing, and counting the 
years they had been on Earth. He could even hear them talking to their young. 
They often encouraged Ricky to grow. "Stand tall! Reach for the skies!" they'd 
tell him. Sometimes when he got an A on a spelling test or something else hard, 
he'd think of the trees and know they were proud. 
</P>
<P>
 So when everyone was still eating breakfast, Ricky headed out into the chilly 
morning by himself. He thought he'd visit a special place he'd found near the 
stream. He'd talk to the trees and nestle deep into the grass. He'd get his 
clothes dirty, but Mom would understand. 
</P>
<P>
 As he walked to his spot through the forest, he sang a little song he'd made 
up long ago.  
</P>
<P>
 God of the wind,  
</P>
<P>
 God of the sea,  
</P>
<P>
 Turn me into a giant pine tree!  
</P>
<P>
 He laughed to think of himself as a tree, taller than tall, looking down on 
everyone like they were little dolls. Soon he saw he was walking by a wonderful 
old tree, a big knotty pine that he thought of as an old friend. Smiling, he 
ran to the tree and embraced it. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, it was time to continue his walk -- but something was wrong! His fingers 
were stuck to the bark! As he struggled to free his hands, he felt roots 
envelop his feet. His legs and arms were pinned! His cheeks and chest were 
glued down too -- he couldn't even turn his head! 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, he felt himself being drawn sharply inward. He couldn't see, and 
there was a terrible whooshing sound. He was shooting up, stretching, being 
pulled beyond endurance. He felt his body harden and his neck freeze to 
attention. Strange appendages grew out of his middle. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until his vision came back that Ricky began to panic. Pine cones 
encircled his head and sharp green needles brushed his eyes. Looking down, all 
he could see was dirty brown bark, covered with lichen and bugs. A bird tore at 
the flesh of his side, looking for worms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God, please make me a boy again!" he silently screamed. "Don't leave me 
in this tree! I want to be a boy! I want to go home!" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly his heart leaped with joy. It was Dad, coming to the rescue. He was 
walking quickly, almost trotting, with a look of urgency in his eyes. Johnny 
and Molly were with him and they were nearly running to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurry, Dad, hurry!" Ricky strained to shout. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Dad reached him and gave him a long, loving look. He put his big, warm 
hand on Ricky's frozen leg and gave it a reassuring pat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of firewood in this one," he said. And he raised his ax.

 Ted reread the sign outside the Halloween haunted house. "What do you think 
that is?" he asked Cesar. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy in a block of ice," Cesar said. "It's a rip-off." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's dead?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course he's dead , moron." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted paid the money and went inside. An open vault was set in a dismal hallway. 
Blue-tinged ice filled the vault. A network of cracks and bubbles clouded the 
ice. It was impossible to see anything more than the outline of whatever 
creature was inside. A vague hand (claw?) came within inches of the surface, 
frozen in a death grip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome," said the attendant. "I am Mr. Plinth. You are privileged to gaze 
upon an authentic and educational aberration of nature. Gaze upon it and never 
be the same again!" 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it, exactly?" Ted asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people see an angel and some see a devil. I think people see whatever 
they want to see. That thing in there, it changes. And sometimes you can hear 
creaking noises, like that thing is calling to someone . . . like it wants out 
of the ice. I've heard it!" 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think it is?" 
</P>
<P>
 Plinth's laugh revealed crooked, tobacco-stained teeth. "An excellent 
question! Is it the Abominable Snowman? A Sasquatch? Who can tell? A man in 
Nevada accused me of sewing a sea lion's head on a dead monkey! I have spent 
the last 27 years studying this thing, and if anything, I know less than when I 
started." 
</P>
<P>
 "You satisfied?" Cesar taunted after Ted left the haunted house. "I told you 
it was a rip-off." 
</P>
<P>
 "Have respect for the dead," Ted replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "You idiot. My father saw the exact same thing when he was a kid in Mexico, 
only then it was supposed to be the body of John Dillinger. They keep sending 
that hunk of ice around the country. They tell people in one town it's a 
Bigfoot. They tell guys in the next town it's something they pulled out of a 
flying saucer. I heard it's just a dead bear from a circus somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then why are they making such a big deal about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because people are stupid enough to pay $2 to see it, that's why." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted was silent for most of the walk home. "I wonder if anyone's ever melted 
the ice down to see what's in there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course not," Cesar insisted. "The guy knows it's a bear." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crumbling mansion used for the haunted house had not been occupied in 
years. Ted had heard that you could get inside through a rotted back door. That 
night he found his way in with a flashlight. The refrigerator's hum led him to 
the ice devil. Ted pulled the electric plug free of the socket. He poured salt 
on the ice to speed the melting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what you are, Mr. Devil," Ted whispered, "but I'm going to find 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted hadn't bargained on how long it would take the ice to melt. It took 
forever for just the top half inch to turn to cloudy liquid. Ted could see the 
"claw" a little better -- that was all. As hours passed, Ted slumped on the 
floor. Gentle dripping lulled him to sleep. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "WHAT WAS THAT?!?" Ted awoke suddenly. Was someone in the house? He didn't see 
anyone. Ted leaned over the vault. The ice was nearly all gone now. Ted's 
flashlight beam picked out nothing except a few dead leaves floating in stale 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The vault's refrigerator chugged into action. It had been plugged in again. 
Ted turned, too slowly. Something as cold and raw as a beef liver wrapped 
around his head and held it under the water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Plinth arrived late the next afternoon. He found muddy footprints leading 
away from the vault. "Kids," he cursed. He shook his head and checked the 
vault. 
</P>
<P>
 The ice devil had changed again. It glowed like a haunted gem. Plinth blinked 
and saw the source of the glow. The devil's hand clasped a flashlight. Its beam 
cut through frozen swirls of bubbles. Plinth gulped from his pocket flask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'll be the devil," he muttered. But now Ted was.

COULD THIS BE THE END OF AN ERA FOR FARRAR, STRAUS?; BOOKS: AFTER NEARLY FIVE 
DECADES AS AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY, THE PUBLISHER IS EXPECTED TO SELL A MAJORITY 
OF ITS STOCK TO A LARGER FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Asoggy Florida rain had let up in time to move the lavish party out under the 
night sky. On that evening in May of 1993, booksellers, editors and their 
guests sipped and mingled in honor of Scott Turow, the best-selling 
lawyer/author of "Presumed Innocent" and the new "Pleading Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Turow accepted compliment after compliment for his nimble legal thrillers, but 
he was not the center of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his publisher and host, Roger Straus Sr., silver-haired and radiant 
in a tropical white ensemble, gathered party-goers and schmoozed like a jaunty 
showman. He boasted that he was about to add 100,000 copies to the 1 million of 
"Pleading Guilty" already in print. 
</P>
<P>
 In his heart, however, Straus may have been feeling guilty himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Turow's novels had been selling in numbers sturdy enough to cushion a 
lot of Farrar, Straus & Giroux's less commercial titles -- and to pay for the 
night's splash at the palatial Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables during the 
American Booksellers Assn. convention.  
</P>
<P>
 But for all of Straus' outward bonhomie, a new Turow novel was "not his kind 
of thing," to quote a colleague, and he apparently worried about the 
possibility that the writer's runaway bestsellers would give the independent 
Farrar, Straus a much too commercial image. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Straus' house was Nobel Prize house, the esteemed publisher of 
Isaac Bashevis Singer, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Joseph Brodsky, William Golding, 
Nadine Gordimer and Derek Walcott. 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher saw commercial fare as the province of other New York 
publishers, almost all of which have been acquired in recent years by large 
conglomerates and now sought out Big Books in keener appreciation of the bottom 
line than of literary luster. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half later, the publishing house that Straus built and guarded in 
Spartan confines on Union Square is about to follow the competitors he so often 
slammed with the salty expletives for which he is known. 
</P>
<P>
 In an all but inconceivable development, the 77-year-old man of letters is 
expected to announce today that the majority of Farrar, Straus stock will be 
sold to a larger corporation -- Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, a German 
concern that owns Henry Holt and Co., a New York book publisher also respected 
for its literary tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of an era? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Straus said Friday, "because I chose a purchaser that will 
preserve the integrity and uniqueness of Farrar, Straus. The company will 
remain independent and separate now and for the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 F oreseeable future. Some industry observers say they expect few changes at 
Farrar, Straus. Yet others have been quick to recall that William Shawn became 
a consulting editor at the publishing house after the longtime autonomous 
editor of the New Yorker was ousted in 1987 by S.I. Newhouse Jr. -- the 
magazine's new owner who had expressed similar guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 And Straus, who said he will now become the sole minority stockholder in his 
company, "with equality on the board," added that he has no plans to retire and 
move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will have what I laughingly call 'a lifetime contract' with the company, 
and Jonathan Galassi will remain as editor in chief." 
</P>
<P>
 Straus battled cancer a decade ago and underwent surgery for an aneurysm a few 
years later, "but I'm in good health now as far as anyone can tell me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to do this sale sooner rather than later first of all to protect my 
authors, and also my staff and the stockholders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling one of New York's most distinguished publishing houses after nearly 
five decades as an independent entity will acknowledge not only Straus' 
advanced years but also unresolved philosophical differences between a father 
and his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Straus III -- who had left the company only to come back in 1985 as 
managing director and then leave again last year -- has been engaged as a 
photographer and a packager of books for other publishers. The elder Straus 
said he sought a buyer only after being assured by his son that he would not 
return to the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Straus III, now 50, "wanted to move faster than I felt we should," his 
father said last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger man had spearheaded expansion atop the enormous profits generated 
by Turow and one of his father's authors, Tom Wolfe, whose "The Bonfire of the 
Vanities" became one of the biggest books of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff tripled in size, to about 100 employees, and sales also tripled, to 
about $30 million a year. It was uneasy growth for Straus senior, who 
remembered that the bestseller-fueled expansion in the 1950s had nearly 
bankrupted him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who worked alongside both men recalled that there was tension between 
the two. According to these sources, Straus senior favored Wolfe, Susan Sontag 
and other Farrar, Straus writers of their generation, while Roger III brought 
in new editors -- such as Galassi, who edits Turow -- to put the company more 
closely in line with popular tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, these colleagues said, Straus senior saw the company getting away 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the Holtzbrinck group will have the majority stake, Straus is 
heralding new growth as a result of a cash infusion, "so that our purchasing 
power will be up about 25%." 
</P>
<P>
 As Straus sees it, his house will be able to bring out 100 to 110 books a year 
-- compared with the 90 to 100 it publishes now -- and to sign some of the 
authors who were exiled when Simon & Schuster and other big houses folded less 
profitable literary imprints such as Atheneum and Ticknor & Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Trillin, a Farrar, Straus author who wrote the recent bestseller 
"Remembering Denny," voiced little concern about the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume that it won't represent any change in the way they do business, 
unless they wanted to put an extra layer of linoleum in some of those rooms," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the publisher's literary refinement, "the place looks like the 
branch office of a failing insurance company."

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; JAY GEILS, MAGIC DICK SPROUT BLUES FROM NEWFOUND ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's call it "Full Circle Syndrome." Popular among jazz, blues and rock 
artists, FCS occurs when musicians are credited with a return to their "roots," 
are said to rediscover the "music of their youth," their "first love," or, most 
overblown of all, are doing "what they always wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 There are extreme examples of this, as when over-the-hill rock drummers turn 
to be-bop. But not all attacks of FCS are so irritating. Take the Jay 
Geils-Magic Dick group Bluestime, which played Saturday night on the patio at 
the Cantina La Vida. 
</P>
<P>
 As members of the hard-rocking J. Geils Band, Geils and Dick (Richard Salwitz) 
stayed closer to pop's blues roots than most commercially successful outfits. 
Sure, they had some tunes custom-tooled for sales. But Dick's thick, inventive 
harmonica tones and guitarist Geils' insistent blues bent always had a touch of 
that Chicago feel, no matter what material Peter Wolf was singing. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's not that great a leap for Geils and Dick to add an upright bassist, a 
pulse-oriented second guitarist and a slap-happy drummer, and to start jumping 
to tunes influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson or Buddy Guy and Junior Wells. This 
tough, boogie-minded style of urban blues was a sure winner at this rustic 
roadhouse up Carbon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 With a raft of Harley Davidsons parked outside the front door and black 
leather (often-fringed) the attire of choice, the Cantina provided the perfect 
setting for Bluestime's hard-driving ways. Fans crowded onto the patio's 
benches and round concrete tables, or stood where they could. The dance floor 
was crowded constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 During the opening band's set, a disturbance broke out up front and a knot of 
nearly a dozen people danced slowly back-and-forth like a rugby scrum until the 
offending parties were settled. Anybody ready for a little blues? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the chilly temperature, Bluestime stayed warm and upbeat, playing few 
ballads. Though there were occasional shouts for "Centerfold" and "Freeze 
Frame," Dick and Geils avoided their checkered past and stuck mainly to tunes 
from their new Bluestime recording. 
</P>
<P>
 When they did look back, the selection only underscored the old Geils Band's 
ties to the style of music Geils and Dick play now. Coming near the end of the 
show, "Whammer Jammer," an instrumental feature for Dick's rich, springy 
harmonica work that dates back to the 1972 Geils Band "Full House" album, gave 
the people what they wanted. Dick's long-on-breath playing was some of his most 
agile of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dick's harmonica is the band's centerpiece, he often pocketed the 
instrument for entire numbers and worked strictly as a singer. Though he was 
capable, his delivery was a bit too even, unmarked by bursts of passion, and 
humbled by a bland though not unpleasant tone. Only on harmonica does he really 
kick loose. The most magical moments came when he and Geils combined tones, as 
they did during "Nine Below Zero." They have an uncanny way of following each 
other around in a not-quite unison, their amplified sounds melting together to 
produce a flowing, honey-coated blend. 
</P>
<P>
 Geils, though not as exciting as Dick, played with insistence and drive, 
leaving well-considered space between his phrases. And when a tune called for 
more upbeat antics, he showed that he still can rock with the best, as proven 
by his hard-cornering attack on "Pontiac Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 The Max Bangwell band, which opened the evening, proved it has an important 
skill that all roadhouse bands need -- the ability to stay focused and to keep 
playing when a fight breaks out in front of the bandstand. The set included 
songs about frustrated men, overstimulated women, wolves and chickens. Tight 
play from savvy guitarist Job Striles was a consistent delight.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SMALL REVUE IS LARGELY LOVETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The billing, as usual, was this -- Lyle Lovett and His Large Band. And, with 
as many as 14 people on stage in grander moments, the advertising wasn't false. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for most of the 2 1/2-hour set Friday night at the Pantages Theatre, what 
the audience got was effectively Lyle Lovett and His Small Band -- the 
smallness of which represented a large, and largely rewarding, step of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovett made the fullest imaginable use of his extended coterie of singers and 
players, offering a genteel yet steamy melting-pot nonpareil that had ample 
dollops of Memphis blues, R&B, Texas country and swing. This rich revue is one 
of the most reliably satisfying touring shows in pop, even though its 
good-timey high points have become a bit predictable to repeat customers after 
so many trips through town. 
</P>
<P>
 His new album, "I Love Everybody," though, is a marked break from recent form 
in its minimalism, with most of the songs centered on the reliable folk 
triumvirate of acoustic guitar, stand-up bass and brushed drums -- plus cello 
or violin for solo seasoning and a subtly drawn string section on nearly half 
the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The cynic might have reasonably supposed that Lovett would simply downplay the 
harder-to-relay charms of the new album and focus on the tried and truly 
crowd-pleasing Large Band material. But whereas past tours tended to feature a 
few quieter, stripped-down numbers in a block just past the set's midway point, 
that segment was expanded to take up the bulk of this show. The full ensemble's 
brassy sandwiching appearances at the beginning and end were reduced in scope 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 This rethinking didn't just better spotlight current material but also some 
songs from Lovett's earliest albums. The show no longer must end in communal 
bluster but finishes satisfyingly on a relative downer, with "Simple Song" -- a 
more elegiac and suspicious, even, sort of send-off than might have been 
supposed. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say the show was intimate in every way: Lovett's too much of a 
poker player, in persona and in song, for anything remotely resembling direct 
personal revelation. The closest he came to really "sharing," as it were, was 
sending out "She Makes Me Feel Good" to "the girl closest to my heart" on this, 
her birthday. (There was no indication she was in the house.) 
</P>
<P>
 The tunes on his new album were supposedly all written at a much earlier age, 
one interpretation of which might be that Lovett is especially leery of 
anything that might be taken as autobiography now. The lyrics always collect 
bizarre details that invite the listener to sketch in the missing emotions, but 
the feelings are harder to find in this collection. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the Large Band provided a myriad of instrumental highlights. Also, 
a vocal quartet -- now sandwiching Was (Not Was) singers Sweet Pea Atkinson and 
Sir Harry Bowens between mainstay Francine Reed and basso profundo Willie 
Mitchell Jr. -- roused the congregants with astonishingly precise harmonies on 
the likes of "Record Lady" and "Church." The setup this time included a 
not-so-busy horn section left over from past tours as well as a much more 
utilized string section replicating the new album's delectable arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The soloing highlight has been the same for years now but never fails to 
delight: an extended cello turn by John Hagen on a version of "You Can't Resist 
It" that's so superior to the recorded rendition it's just one more reason why 
wagon-master Lovett, of all people, really should make a live album

MUSIC REVIEW; MUSIC CENTER MANAGES TO GET A HANDEL ON OLD 'XERXES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you like Baroque opera, you'll love George Frideric Handel's "Xerxes," 
a.k.a. "Serse," as performed by the Music Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll love the exquisite singing, the delicate ensemble work, the elegant 
staging, the stylish impulses that emanate from the pit. You'll be charmed, 
even moved, by the period conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Xerxes" (ever helpful, the Music Center ads tell the unwashed to pronounce 
the name "ZERK-sees") was written in 1738 for the King's Theatre in London. 
Audiences in those days knew what they wanted, and Handel delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, he delivered a series of impeccably balanced, meticulously 
constructed formulas. Some are serious. Most aren't. All, in one way or 
another, are graceful at best and witty at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The hand-me-down libretto pretends to concern certain intimate adventures of 
Xerxes I, King of Persia from 485 to 465 BC. In truth, however, the opera is 
just another convoluted comedy of eros in which this one loves that one but 
that one loves this one and the other one doesn't know that this one is really 
that one in disguise. Or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Handel cranked out beautiful melodies by the mile. The Music Center production 
omits four numbers (pardonably) yet still offers 3 1/2 generous hours of fancy, 
reflective arias separated by propulsive recitatives and framed, occasionally, 
by soothing sinfonias or obligatory choruses. 
</P>
<P>
 When a bona-fide duet materializes in the last act, the shock is deliriously 
welcome. Ensembles are conspicuously absent. This isn't "Le Nozze di Figaro." 
It isn't even "Idomeneo." 
</P>
<P>
 All the major voices in "Xerxes," not incidentally, are treble voices. When a 
minor character opens his mouth and turns out to be a basso, the surprise is 
shattering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Xerxes" may not consistently delight sensibilities accustomed to the 
profundities of Mozart, much less the heroics of Verdi or the passions of 
"Pagliacci." Handel offers undoubted rewards, however, to anyone willing to sit 
back, relax and enjoy a leisurely ride to the innocent, archaic, florid, 
courtly past. Saturday night, at least one reluctant rider -- this one -- had 
to admit to a certain impatience with the longueurs of the precious 
18th-Century idiom, but that was his problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Xerxes" demands to be revived in the cool light of 1994, it certainly 
deserves tender, loving, enlightened care. That, thank goodness and Peter 
Hemmings, is precisely what it got here. 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick Brydon conducted with dauntless poise, equally responsive to Handel's 
agitated agonies, arching ecstasies and humorous diversions. The British 
maestro never resorted to romantic excess, always breathed with the singers and 
even provided clever accompaniment for the recitatives at the harpsichord. The 
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra met his enlightened demands with exceptional 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical production was originally created for the long, low and narrow 
alfresco stage of the Santa Fe Opera. This imposed the limitations of an open 
unit set that ignored the composer's requests for a garden, a square, a bridge 
and, ultimately, a sun temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Wadsworth -- the mastermind who created the adaptation and the 
rhyme-conscious translation as well as the fluid and inventive staging scheme 
-- decided to play all the action in front of a pretty brick house in what 
looks for all the world like Handel's London. Thomas Lynch's handsome, 
ultra-realistic construction is backed by a huge picture-frame cyclorama that 
suggests temporal and climatic changes. Martin Pakledinaz's lavish costumes 
reinforce the 18th-Century ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, the updating doesn't really hurt. Xerxes in a powdered wig 
isn't Julius Caesar on a motorcycle. Wadsworth delineates the diverse 
characters with finesse, amid a pervasive aura of restrained yet cheeky 
bravado. A little irreverence can go a long way. Here it goes just far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The well-matched singers are marvelous -- dramatically alert and vocally 
virtuosic yet never vulgar or self-serving. It isn't always that way when 
modern musicians go for baroque. 
</P>
<P>
 At the dressy opening (which wasn't sold out), Lorraine Hunt wound her 
lustrous mezzo-soprano around the heroic coloratura lines of the amorous king 
with splendid bravado. She set the tone for the proceedings with a delicately 
ardent performance of the only hit tune on the agenda: "Ombra mai fu." She also 
conveyed a perfect hint of self-mockery in her gently pompous demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Handel wrote the title role for the superstar castrato Caffarelli, and it 
might have been interesting to hear a countertenor in the challenge here. Brian 
Asawa, the magnificent countertenor on duty, however, was cast as Xerxes' 
brother, Arsamene. He exuded urgent dignity and sang with staggering purity, 
sweetness, flexibility and dynamic subtlety, as needed. This young man deals in 
revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwendolyn Bradley brought exquisite, limpid tone and dignity to the ornate 
cantilena of Romilda, the princess everyone seems to love, and a nice jolt of 
impetuosity too. Susannah Waters was adorably pert but never cute-cute-cute as 
her exquisitely soubrettish sister, Atalanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The home team was most honorably represented by Paula Rasmussen as Amastre, 
Xerxes' misplaced betrothed who sings bravura arias and spends much of the 
evening disguised as a man; and by John Atkins as Elviro, Arsamene's smart 
servant who sings comic arias and spends much of the evening disguised as a 
woman. Jan Opalach dispatched the modest basso duties of Ariodate with paternal 
panache. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons unknown, the opera was not performed in the original Italian. 
Nevertheless, distracting supertitles flashed the English text in redundant 
English on the proscenium screen. Under the circumstances, one could understand 
why some of the singers didn't deem it necessary to articulate the words very 
clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Xerxes," Music Center Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Wednesday, Nov. 8, 
12 at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 1. $21 to $115. (213) 972-7211.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; IT'S A GOOD TIME TO HANG UP ON THIS 'LATE CALL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jerky show is getting jerkier. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by co-executive producer Brandon Tartikoff as furthering 
late-night's "noble trend of topicality," the syndicated half hour "Late Call" 
and its cast of post- wunderkinds slid into the fall season on a floe of smug 
hipness. Their weeknight assignment? To occupy a half-circle of easy chairs on 
a set in New York and pop off. And to be not just topical -- anyone can do that 
-- but to be topical and cute . 
</P>
<P>
 The call went out. From magazines came former Esquire editor-in-chief, now 
Sports Afield editor-in-chief and publisher Terry McDonell, the Adult . From 
National Public Radio and Spin magazine came Elvis Mitchell, the Critic . From 
the Sunday Times of London came Sue Ellicott, the Chick . From God knows where 
came Tad Low, the Infant . And all the way from a life of experiencing events 
"which were to become remarkable memories" came Brianne Leary, the Irritant , 
fated to become little more than a memory herself after banishment to the 
field, from where she now checks in occasionally like a distant relative. 
</P>
<P>
 The topicality lags, but never the cuteness. Low: "Smart super-model is an 
oxymoron." Ellicott: "Todd, that's terrible."  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but "terrible" is exactly what "Last Call" is about. 
</P>
<P>
 That trait blazed on the show's marquee last Wednesday night when the Rev. Al 
visited. African American activist Sharpton needed no prompting to loosely 
equate the O.J. Simpson case with the "high-tech lynching" that Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas protested when questioned about Anita Faye Hill's 
sexual-harassment allegations during his 1991 confirmation hearing. Sharpton 
resonated the skepticism that many African Americans have about the U.S. legal 
system, including most of those interviewed on the street by Mitchell for this 
segment. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that examining African American attitudes vis a vis Simpson isn't useful, 
only that what followed exposed "Last Call" for the frivolous fop and gratingly 
snide prankster that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time for the other side of the argument. Hence, served to Sharpton and 
the panel like salami on rye, heavy on the mustard, was Bob Grant, a veteran 
New York radio talk-show host known for his short fuse and demagogic statements 
about race relations. It turns out that Grant is also a masochist. The human 
sacrifice was interviewed by satellite in his own radio studio, downplaying 
racism as a problem in general and fielding questions from the panel that lit 
him up like Times Square. After being sufficiently provoked by this verbal 
gangbanging, Grant did what "Last Call" wanted him to do. He had a snit, 
angrily breaking off the interview and storming out of his own studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Nyeh nyeh nyeh-nyeh nyeh . Time for Tad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Call" now proceeded to its next item, with the grinning Low, who could 
suck the intelligence from any gathering, skipping upstairs to his loft to 
introduce a nauseating parody of a wedding video of O.J. and Nicole Brown 
Simpson that mocked her and ended with a deranged O.J. savagely slashing the 
wedding cake. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd have expected Sharpton -- who had wondered earlier whether an impartial 
Simpson jury could be impaneled, given media-whipped pretrial publicity -- to 
have angrily fled the show himself at that point. Yet when asked if he'd like 
to return to "Last Call," this newer and calmer version of the old showboating 
Sharpton said sure -- a pragmatist about TV exposure to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 That Nicole Simpson was brutally slain in Los Angeles along with Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, leaving her small children motherless, earns her a prominent spot on 
the "Last Call" hit list. Thursday night found Leary in West Los Angeles 
quipping -- it was dark humor minus the humor -- about that sleazy new book 
about Nicole Simpson. "Last Call" also dispatched Ellicott to the streets to 
question opinionated Camille Paglia about famous people. Somehow still standing 
after colliding with Paglia's withering verbiage, Ellicott asked her the show's 
obligatory question about Nicole Simpson. Paglia didn't miss a beat. "A star 
after her death," she began in a whoosh. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexplicably, Nicole Simpson's name didn't surface in Mitchell's taped chat 
with Joni Mitchell, an oversight for which he could be docked. The show 
concluded with the hyper Low -- if ever a face begged for a cream pie, it's his 
-- doing some nonsense about a McDonald's menu being able to blunt Presidential 
assassinations. Food throwing -- a fitting remembrance of him and the show. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a fine line separating smart-ass and dumb-ass. "Last Call" crosses it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So do Tom and Roseanne. NBC's Halloween night movie about the mud-wrestling 
Arnolds verifies that intermarriage between a ghoul and a goblin should not 
occur. It also gives new meaning to Enough already ! As if one Roseanne were 
not sufficiently scary, "Roseanne and Tom: Behind the Scenes" spews a deuce. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Richard Colla, Eugenie Ross-Leming's and Brad Buckner's script has 
Roseanne periodically schmoozing with her subconscious, a second Roseanne who 
materializes as if beamed down from the starship Enterprise. Although played 
straight, these intimate, Roseanne-to-Roseanne chats are just a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne 1: "Can you believe he (her husband) thought something was going on 
between Tom and me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne 2: "Wasn't there?" 
</P>
<P>
 If this processed cheese is unpalatable, you can always occupy yourself by 
counting the times Tom and Roseanne say "cool" or "way cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrika Darbo is Roseanne-shaped, sloppily chews gum like Roseanne and 
uncannily clones her whiny voice, cackle and cutting sarcasm. With an obscene 
mouth that would freak out even Prof. Henry Higgins, Roseanne is no fair lady, 
ever in a snit here over her ABC sitcom and abusing people arbitrarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Lee has Tom's physical side down pat, expertly copying the nervous 
tics and mannerisms of a man played here as a talentless, coke-snorting bully 
whose wealth, fame and megalomania balloon simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the movie is flabby enough for liposuction, its best scene 
finds Tom and Roseanne, their notorious marriage now buckling under its own 
public coarseness, rolling on the ground having a fight in front of a stunned 
studio audience prior to the taping of a "Roseanne" episode. "That happened," 
an NBC spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, you'd have to say that NBC's Tom and Roseanne are way cooler than 
the Tom and Roseanne of Fox's movie on the Arnolds three weeks ago, which 
bombed so badly in the ratings that NBC apparently feared its own debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a gimmick, it asked the real Roseanne to create a sort of out-of-body 
gala by doing a running critique on her own unauthorized biography as it aired. 
Showing uncommon restraint for her, Roseanne refused. Even she knows that three 
Roseannes are a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Roseanne and Tom: Behind the Scenes" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 
36 and 39). "Last Call" airs weeknights at 10:30 on KCOP-TV Channel 13.

 New Talk Shows Struggling: Virtually none of the new syndicated talk shows 
that premiered last month have won a significant audience locally. According to 
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the month of October, programs starring Marilu 
Henner, Suzanne Somers, Susan Powter, Star Jones, Gordon Elliot, Dennis Prager, 
Marilyn Kagen and Jon Stewart have floundered in the Los Angeles market. But 
older talk shows have been flourishing. "Montel Williams' " ratings on KCOP-TV 
Channel 13 were up 41% over a year ago, while KCOP's "Ricki Lake Show" improved 
65% from last October. Even KCOP's unheralded "Richard Bey Show," airing in the 
ultra-competitive 3 p.m. talk-show hour, was up 65% over last year, beating 
veteran "Geraldo," tying "Sally Jessy Raphael" and trailing only talk queen 
"Oprah Winfrey," whose own ratings dipped about 6% from the previous year.

 Not Easy Being Green: Kermit called himself the "first frog to speak before 
the Oxford Union" as he delivered a speech to 1,000 cheering students at the 
British university on Friday. Kermit also pointed out that he was honored to be 
at Oxford since "frogs usually only get in here by being an experiment." But 
the fact that Kermit had arrived at all at the debating chamber irked some 
Oxonians, who wondered if a society whose past presidents include five British 
prime ministers should be giving lily-pad space to a frog. Is a Muppet fit to 
join a list of past speakers that includes Mother Teresa and Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu? The current president of the Union, Jeremy Green, defended Kermit's 
visit: "Students of our generation grew up with the Muppets on television, and 
Kermit's got something to say." LEGAL FILE

 T-Bone's Trial: Rapper Ice Cube's backup singer T-Bone is scheduled for trial 
next month on charges of shooting a man to death at a bowling alley. Superior 
Court Judge John Shook in Torrance set the Nov. 14 trial date for Terry E. 
Gray, 24, known as T-Bone. Gray, who is also a member of the rap group Da Lench 
Mob, is charged with murder and attempted murder in the February slaying of 
Herbert Battle, 22, and the wounding of Lashawn Townsend, 22, both of Los 
Angeles. Gray was freed in March on $1.5 million bail. His lawyer said he left 
the bowling alley before the shootings occurred.

Superior Court hearing is set for Nov. 10 to approve the deal, terms of which 
were not disclosed. Thomas sued the station in June, 1993, saying the station 
suspended him, then fired him two days later in a breach of contract. MOVIES

 Shooting Star: "Stargate," the sci-fi adventure movie starring Kurt Russell, 
was first out of the gate at the box office during the weekend. The MGM film 
grossed $16.8 million its first weekend in release to take the No. 1 spot, 
according to early industry estimates. There was a significant drop to second 
place: Miramax's "Pulp Fiction" garnered $5.5 million for No. 2 after two weeks 
at No. 1. In third, Warner Bros.' "The Specialist" with $4 million and in 
fourth, Warner Bros.' "Love Affair" with $3.6 million. In a disappointing 
opening, Columbia's "The Road to Wellville" tied with Universal's "The River 
Wild" with $2.7 million apiece for fifth place. A box office note: Paramount's 
"Forrest Gump" has surpassed "Home Alone" to become the fourth highest-grossing 
domestic movie of all time. The film has taken in $286.2 million to date.

SCREENING ROOM: CELEBRATING HALLOWEEN WITH A PAIR OF HORROR CLASSICS

 Celebrate Halloween tonight at 8 at the Silent Movie, which will present a 
pair of German Expressionist classics, F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu: A Symphony of 
Horrors" (1922), the first and the greatest of the Dracula features, and Paul 
Wegener and Carl Boese's brooding "The Golem" (1920), in which a rabbi in 
16th-Century Prague creates a clay monster (played by Wegener) who comes alive 
to help the Jews combat expulsion from the ghetto on orders from the emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Schreck's Count Dracula is one of the cinema's most indelible images. 
Cadaverous in the extreme, with pointed ears and clawlike hands, the count has 
black-encircled eyes that express a tormented loneliness and a fevered 
desperation that make him seem as if he had just stepped out of an Edvard Munch 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Craving fresh supplies of human blood, and no doubt human companionship as 
well, the count has told one of his acolytes, Renfield (Alexander Granach), a 
creepy Bremen estate agent, to secure a suitable residence in town. To that end 
Renfield dispatches "to some lost corner of the Carpathians" in Transylvania 
his clerk Jonathan Harker (Gustav von Wangenheim) to set the deal with the 
count. The year is 1838, but the count has been Nosferatu the Vampire for four 
centuries. . . . "Nosferatu" is a profoundly romantic film, with a deep, 
abiding faith in the ultimate redemptive power of love.

 A Distinctive 'Woman': Huang Shuqin's "Woman Demon Human" screens Thursday at 
7 p.m. in Room 202 in USC's Taper Hall of Humanities as part of the 
university's International Film Club's "Women Make Movies" series. It begins as 
many films about actresses do: with the heroine sitting at her dressing table 
looking back on her life as she applies her makeup. Although classic in form, 
this exquisite film by one of China's few women directors has so many 
distinctive details and is so clearly the work of a liberated, reflective 
sensibility that it offers an altogether fresh experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Huang's lovely heroine Qiu Yin (Xu Shouli) is only 30, but her life has 
already been filled with both accomplishment and heartbreak. The child of 
traveling opera performers whose mother runs off with another man, Qiu Yin 
deals with every one of life's challenges and setbacks by throwing herself into 
her work. Determined to break precedent, she ultimately wins the chance to play 
the Chinese opera's more demanding male roles, winning fame as the 
ferocious-looking ghost of ancient Chinese folklore, Zhong Kui, who zealously 
tries to marry off his beloved sister.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the film, a dream-like performance of this one-act opera is 
intercut with Qiu Yin's memories as she gradually accepts that this stellar 
demon has married her to the stage. What could have been a soapy, old-fashioned 
"woman's picture" becomes a reverie on art as a way to salvation.

 A Funny 'Blond': On a far lighter note Yves Robert's hilarious 1972 "The Tall 
Blond Man With One Black Shoe" screens Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at UCLA's Melnitz 
Theater as part of its film archive's Gaumont retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 A satire on the absurd, potentially lethal excesses of government espionage, 
it's so funny that one is in constant danger of forgetting that the points it 
makes so deftly couldn't be more serious. An elaborate prologue triggers an 
avalanche of inspired mayhem as Pierre Richard's concert violinist is mistaken 
for a spy, caught in a rivalry between government agents. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the funniest French comedies ever, it is funnier than the 1985 remake, 
"The Man with One Red Shoe" with Tom Hanks.

 Gypsy Culture: Tony Gatlif's rapturously beautiful "Latcho Drom" ("Safe 
Journey"), which opens a one-week run at the Nuart Friday, celebrates the 
sustaining power of music in Gypsy culture, as he retraces the migration of the 
Rom people from India that began 1,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As he moves through the Mideast to Eastern and Western Europe, he films 
Gypsies singing and dancing amid vignettes of their nomadic existence, marked 
by hardship and discrimination to this day. The images are as glorious as the 
music, which is alternately joyous and mournful. 
</P>
<P>
 Most memorable is an older woman's haunting lament for the Gypsies who died at 
Auschwitz.

JAZZ; MULLIGAN, WILSON IN THE SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerry Mulligan and Gerald Wilson -- similar in name, if not in style -- were 
the standouts of the Friday and Saturday performances at KLON's Jazz West Coast 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan, one of the two or three biggest names in West Coast jazz in the 
'50s, dominated Friday's events. His participation began the afternoon with a 
lighthearted, one-man panel discussion at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Hotel, 
the festival's primary venue. 
</P>
<P>
 One story he told the enthralled audience was about the mundane circumstances 
surrounding the decision to form his famous pianoless quartet. Simply, the club 
where he was working refused to provide a grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his current quartet's evening concert at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts 
Center, Mulligan was every bit as warm, gregarious and communicative with his 
baritone sax as he had been with his reminiscences. Sprinkling a set of newer 
material with a few ballads and originals, he played with the gorgeous tone and 
perky rhythmic swing that have characterized his music for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's role in the festival might have been smaller, but his appearance 
rescued a Saturday night program at the Performing Arts Center that was in 
danger of drifting into dreary irrelevance. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening group of orchestrations by Marty Paich and Jack Montrose was played 
in dispirited fashion by a large ensemble that, despite its obvious skills, 
seemed to simply be going through the motions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennie Niehaus enlivened the proceedings somewhat with his brisk charts, but 
it remained for arranger-composer-conductor Wilson, who's 76, to definitively 
turn things around. Clearly enjoying himself, he conducted his colorful, 
hard-swinging arrangements with the energy and enthusiasm of a Leonard 
Bernstein. By the time Wilson kicked off an animated treatment of "Perdido," 
the audience had finally come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a number of other appealing elements in the two days of 
performances: a series of entertaining sets by groups led by Dave Pell, Bud 
Shank, Buddy Collette, Bill Perkins, Jack Montrose and Pete Rugolo; a bevy of 
piano trios; an all-star musical tour through the history of the seminal jazz 
club, the Lighthouse; and the ailing Jimmy Giuffre's courageous duo appearance 
with pianist Paul Bley. 
</P>
<P>
 A Friday night big band presentation of Shorty Rogers' music was less 
impressive, hampered by the absence of Rogers, who could not attend because of 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 And the U.S. debut of Herb Geller's musical, "Playing Jazz," lacked the 
dramatic content and story continuity to sustain 90 minutes. Geller's music was 
superb, overflowing with sweeping melodies and rich harmonics. But the 
production desperately needs a good lyricist. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day festival was to conclude on Sunday.

COUNTERPUNCH: DOC SHOWS GIVE WRONG HEALTH-CARE DIAGNOSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH TUROW, Joseph Turow is a professor of communication at the University 
of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. He is the author of 
Playing Doctor: Television, Storytelling and Medical Power (Oxford University 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pity the Clintons and their supporters in the health-care debate. Now they 
even have part of the new prime-time television lineup against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite misfires with network medical dramas in recent years, NBC and CBS are 
again taking a stab at behind-the-scenes views of doctors' work with "ER" and 
"Chicago Hope." Critics have lauded both programs for acting and writing; "ER" 
has been a ratings winner. For health-care reformers, though, neither show can 
be good news. It would not be surprising if people who watch them end up 
wondering what the reformers' fuss is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider how both shows act out the state of health care in America. Here are 
three propositions that those who are trying to reshape medicine accept as 
gospel. Look at what "ER" and "Chicago Hope" have to say about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1: Many major U.S. hospitals are suffering deeply under the weight 
of uninsured individuals who are flooding emergency rooms and filling expensive 
beds . 
</P>
<P>
 What suffering? Both of these TV citadels look and sound great. Floors shine, 
walls look modern, equipment is terrific, the morale impressive. The E.R. in 
"ER" is a busy, even frenetic place, but the program does not reflect 
reformers' claims that lines are unbearable, infectious diseases rampant, 
demands overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 The one mention of scarcity in "ER's" first four episodes turned out to be 
more the prelude to a surprising romance than a medical point. A female E.R. 
doc exchanges angry words with the male director of the psychiatric ward about 
his refusal to admit a welfare patient. But the psychiatrist argues that the 
ambiguity of the patient's problem, not the cost of care, is the relevant 
roadblock. Anyway, the entire issue disappears into a startling scene where the 
two physicians who argued are shown sharing a bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago Hope" uses the issue of money to heighten drama fairly frequently, 
but money always loses. In one episode, the hospital's budget director and some 
of the board of directors prattle on about the high costs of certain uninsured 
surgical procedures that a surgeon wants to perform. In the end, though, the 
medical director overrules them by saying angrily that he will recoup the 
million-dollar cost from the research grants of some of his fancy physicians. 
It seems that there is always some pot of gold to help a patient's rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 2: Uninsured Americans, especially disadvantaged minorities, 
suffer due to lack of care . Not in these shows. Both are veritable melting 
pots of ethnicities. But nobody asks anybody for insurance cards and health 
professionals who don't treat all people equally get in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Chicago Hope," for example, a resident is reprimanded severely by a 
surgeon for hesitating to deal with a bleeding white prostitute who admits 
being HIV positive. Not only does the resident apologize, but the surgeon tries 
to help the prostitute fight infection by carrying out a hugely expensive 
experimental bone marrow transplant. At the end of the episode, she is lying on 
a gurney next to a middle-aged black man who also has undergone a hugely 
expensive experimental operation to give him an ape's heart until a human donor 
can be found. Equal-opportunity care-giving here. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 3: To maximize the value of scarce medical resources, high-tech 
medicine must be de-emphasized in favor of primary physicians and managed care 
.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here, of course, is where debates about various health-care proposals run 
rampant. Is it good that government and corporate policy-makers want teaching 
programs to turn out fewer specialists and more family practitioners, general 
internists and general pediatricians? Should we be comfortable that companies 
are channeling their employees into health maintenance organizations, where 
primary physicians are coordinators of care and gatekeepers to specialists? 
</P>
<P>
 In "ER" and "Chicago Hope," there is no debate. For these shows, high-tech, 
hospital-based medicine is not just the best medicine, it is the only medicine 
worth dramatizing. In their worlds, primary-care doctors simply don't exist and 
HMOs hardly rear their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 What counts in "ER" are multiple crises that shift back and forth with 
pulsating MTV-like tension at the edge of chaos, when life hangs in the balance 
and cost is a dirty word. In "Chicago Hope," what counts is the gleaming 
operating room where state-of-the-art doctors use state-of-art machinery to 
advance science, along with their egos. 
</P>
<P>
 "ER's" physicians never deal with health maintenance organizations or any 
other type of insurance company. One way or another, their patients show up and 
receive help. As for "Chicago Hope," one gets the sense that this is a place 
where other specialists who have run out of options send their patients. 
Somehow the hospital gets paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Chicago Hope" did build part of an episode around the problem that a 
gifted neurosurgeon has with an HMO. The patient, a friend of the surgeon's 
secretary, goes to him for a second opinion about a huge tumor at the front of 
her brain. Confident that the HMO's neurosurgeon cannot perform the operation 
successfully (though he says he can), the Chicago Hope doctor offers his 
service. The HMO refuses to use him, however, even when the doctor volunteers 
to reduce his fee to the HMO's rate. The HMO's executives, it turns out, do not 
want to set a costly precedent where their patients take surgery outside the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the HMO neurosurgeon admits his insecurity regarding the procedure, 
and Chicago Hope's lawyer threatens to help the patient mount lawsuits if 
anything goes awry. The managed-care firm allows the right doctor to perform 
the operation, and it is totally successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its upbeat ending, the story is likely to scare the pants off HMO 
members. Yet it fits comfortably into the general philosophy that "Chicago 
Hope" -- and "ER" -- act out about medical care in the United States: that, at 
its best, it is a high-tech battle between knighted physicians and disease; 
that it is generally available to people when they need it and that 
administrators and policy-makers simply ought to give doctors the right tools 
and get out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 These are highly controversial notions, greatly at odds with the conclusions 
of most contemporary health policy analysts. It is difficult to know whether 
the story lines that convey them reflect a principled stand on the health-care 
debate by the programs' creators and producers; more likely, they flow out of a 
long history of doctor-show plots, from "Ben Casey" to "The Bold Ones," from 
"The Lazarus Syndrome" to "MASH" and "St. Elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional TV-doctor formula may well have a great heritage of engrossing 
drama. Yet it carries in it the beliefs and challenges of an era that no longer 
exists. From a ratings standpoint, that may not be a problem. To groups trying 
to educate the public about ways to address the difficulties of a new medical 
environment, it is a major problem indeed.

<P>
 Bernheimer seems to think that the end-all and be-all for Los Angeles would be 
a ballet company. How does he propose we pay for it? And what do we do with the 
large number of dance companies that already exist? And, may I say, barely 
exist, in some instances. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding community doesn't really have much to do with the smaller dance 
companies. Individual contributors don't help. It's extremely tough out there. 
There is a lot more love poured into these organizations than one would 
imagine. And they don't get the respect, or the audiences, that they deserve. 
There is much dance to be seen in this city and a family of four does not have 
to take out a second mortgage just to bring themselves to one of these events. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is filled with numerous cultures and there are dance companies for 
each and every one; we have tap and jazz, ballet, ethnic, modern and more. A 
large ballet company could take away the paltry funding that the smaller 
companies already get. And the money that is received is really not for the 
creation of art. Funders seem to want artists to use whatever meager funds are 
given to them to help cure the ills of society. And while we all have a 
responsibility to the community in which we live, if art is not nurtured, 
preserved and created for tomorrow, there will be nothing left but graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some of us who want to build a home for artists; a place to expand, 
experiment and cultivate their craft. Bernheimer wants a big ballet company. 
Instead, help us raise funds. Take a look around. The big companies are having 
big problems. This isn't the 1970s or '80s. Before we build a large ballet 
company for Los Angeles, why don't we first concentrate on how to bring the 
audiences back into the theater? Where have all the people gone and how are we 
going to get them back? And, on top of all that, the unions are making it 
almost impossible to keep the life form that we call the performing arts alive. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Find us an angel for dance and we'll put together the best dance community in 
the country. The angels exist for theater, opera, music and there must be quite 
a number of angels supporting that big hole in the ground that is named Disney 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is the dollar support for dance? Or is dance becoming elitist like 
everything else in America? You don't want your name on a board roster unless 
the company's budget is at least $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 We have good presenters in this town that will bring the big companies to us. 
Let them do it. But help us build up what we already have, and in the meantime 
let the general public know that there is more to dance than "Swan Lake" and 
more to life than "Roseanne" and microwave popcorn.

THEATER; CHEKHOV'S 'SEAGULL' WINGS IT AMONG MULTIPLE CASTS AT MATRIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chekhov poured a lot of anguish about the act of writing into "The Seagull," 
and in the production of the play now at the Matrix Theatre, some actors best 
known for their TV work pour a lot of anguish about acting into it too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matrix features two revolving casts in the story of Konstantin (Kurt 
Deutsch/Alastair Duncan), the tortured young writer; Arkadina (Barbara 
Babcock/Penny Fuller), his great-lady-of-the-theater mother; Nina (Julia 
Campbell/Anna Gunn), the aspiring actress who is his muse, and Trigorin (Robert 
Foxworth/Cotter Smith), the worldly author Nina worships. 
</P>
<P>
 Both casts (I saw only one) are directed by Milton Katselas, one of L.A.'s 
premiere acting teachers. As a director, Katselas seems much more interested in 
indulging individual performances than in supplying one coherent vision of 
Chekhov's haunted artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, one wants not to indulge but to throttle most of these 
performers. Deutsch's Konstantin complains of his mother's selfishness while 
draping himself all over his uncle's lap like a kvetchy baby; his histrionic 
self-absorption would out-emote anything his mother could possibly come up 
with. In the last act, life has taught Konstantin to be sober, and Deutsch 
achieves this by looking disconcertingly like Ryan O'Neal disapproving of 
Barbra Streisand in "What's Up, Doc?" 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell reduces Nina from a girl shimmering with an appetite for the beauty 
of the world to an annoying suck-up. She throws back her shoulders, thrusts her 
breasts forward and pants with ambition even before she sees Trigorin and has a 
suitable outlet for all her heaving. This reading of Nina has the unfortunate 
effect of rendering her none too bright and making Trigorin's seduction of her 
a very sleazy affair; she is not touching but transparent. 
</P>
<P>
 So too is Babcock's Arkadina, although hers is not nearly so primitive a 
performance. Her alarm at considering Nina's youth and its possible effect on 
Trigorin is quite obvious, yet we are asked to believe she is a great (or at 
least a famous) actress on the Russian stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Katselas turns the Act Three scene in which Arkadina pleads, bullies and does 
anything she must to get Trigorin to stay with her into a kind of raging 
burlesque, a knock-down fight that ends with Arkadina pulling her lover's head 
by his hair to her breast. Other liberties with the text, such as when 
Konstantin rushes at Nina with a shotgun, at times give this production the 
quality of a Mel Brooks parody of what can happen when Hollywood meets Chekhov. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As the snuff-using Masha, Jeanie Hackett resembles an unstable high school 
coke addict, but she's at least amusing, with one notable exception. She 
manages to drown one of the funniest opening lines in all of theater. When the 
schoolteacher Medvedenko (Richard Kind/Gregory Cooke) asks her why she's 
dressed in black, Hackett's Masha answers, "I'm in mourning . . . (turns to 
audience, waits a beat, flings a bunch of dried flowers) . . . for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 As Dorn, the doctor, Jeffrey Tambor employs the big-eyed, uncomprehending 
stare that makes his character on the Garry Shandling show so great, and it 
works here for him when he's pushing valerian drops on everyone like Valium. 
But, when he's a man of the material world rhapsodizing about what it must be 
like to be an artist, the same expression makes the character a tad more 
fatuous than is necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 This is one of Chekhov's most romantic plays in that most of the characters 
attach romantic notions to the art of writing. Just as Dorn imagines that 
creating must be like soaring, Nina believes it to be the greatest human 
ecstasy. And Arkadina's elderly brother, Sorin (Stephen Elliott/Robin Gammell), 
is the most romantic of all. 
</P>
<P>
 In that role, Elliott gives a performance that actually hints at the vast 
melancholy and amusement that Chekhov took in observing the world. He describes 
himself as "the man who wanted" -- the man who wanted to become so many things 
that he did not. When he talks about writing, his eyes grow dreamy behind thick 
glasses as he imagines the glory of what it must be like "even to become a 
second-rate writer." Here Elliott captures the perhaps Old World sensation of 
believing the ability to capture life on paper is one of God's great gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 In its press material, the Matrix notes that "each role will be shared by at 
least two actors, with different combinations creating a new experience each 
night." Of course, no two performances are ever alike anyway, but in the case 
of "The Seagull," one hopes they are as different as possible.

DANCE REVIEW; A SHOWCASE FOR PROWESS OF NEDERLANDS DANS THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jiri Kylian's introspective and often mysterious dances have always invited a 
wide range of personal responses from his audiences. Lately, however, he has 
created works specifically labeled as interactive: coloring books for adults 
that demand the creative interpretation of each viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenging, magnificently danced five-part program by Nederlands Dans 
Theater that opened Friday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center offered 
many such opportunities for filling in the picture. However, Kylian left enough 
clues to his intentions that the evening achieved a greater coherence than you 
might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 To start, the company performed "Whereabouts Unknown" (1993), an extended 
group ritual in which the dancers carried and contemplated tribal masks, 
sometimes seeming to drink from them. Kylian's program note described it as a 
meditation on ancestral roots. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came four short coloring-book pieces punctuated and 
sometimes dominated by the presence of free-standing (or hanging) antique 
gowns: artifacts of a dead European culture that Kylian examined as an 
oppressive legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In "No More Play" (1988), the actions of five dancers (most often divided into 
a male duo and a two-woman, one-man trio) represented what Kylian's note called 
"a game with extremely severe rules, which someone wrote in a long-forgotten 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 His "Petite Mort" (1991) grew openly satiric about that game and those rules 
by costuming his 12 dancers in vintage corsets and incorporating fencing foils 
in increasingly forceful juxtaposition to two of Mozart's swooniest adagios. 
Indeed, the series of gymnastic duets near the end seemed to push the music to 
the breaking point -- seeing how far it would stretch to accommodate 
contemporary energies. 
</P>
<P>
 The breaking point came in "Sarabande" (1990), with Bach shattering into 
electronic fragments and the motions of the six-man cast amplified into a 
thunderous score. But if the old cultural forms no longer survived modern 
rhythms and actions, they persisted in social values -- for instance, in the 
macho behavior that Kylian parodied here. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebellion against gender-specific norms became a major subtext in "Sarabande" 
and the women's octet "Falling Angels" (1989), expressed in both works by 
gestural statements about apparel: the men pulling down their pants, the women 
tugging repeatedly at their bodices. Dance has always defined a society's sense 
of itself; and the women's wry, alienated shrug in "Falling Angels" just might 
belong in a museum right next to those stiff ball gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there's an essential problem with seeing the performance solely as 
Kylian's search for a sense of identity in a culture that he finds hopelessly 
decrepit. Such a view makes his work seem like a lecture and ignores the 
greatest glory of his achievement: the dancing of one of the world's finest 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Looked at another way, the program functioned as a dazzling showcase of 
dancers who can revel in subtle movement nuances one moment and blaze with 
flamboyant virtuosity the next. Although Kylian focuses on body-sculpture more 
than steps, his choreography is always intricately related to its 
accompaniment. As a result, his company has been schooled to a standard of 
musicality equal to any other, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when dancing to 20th-Century composers -- mostly taped music by 
Webern, Reich, Ives and Arvo Part here -- they give Kylian's stark, 
black-and-white dance-panoramas superb richness and depth as if they, too, were 
coloring his pictures moment by moment and, in the process, giving them warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 This triumphant engagement (something of a personal crusade for former OCPAC 
executive director Tom Kendrick) confirms Kylian as a modernist master and his 
company as one of the terpsichorean wonders of the age.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SHERYL CROW'S MAJOR STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheryl Crow's getting famous for singing about life in the wee hours, but the 
L.A.-based performer is ready for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, cameras were rolling while Crow was on stage Friday at the House of 
Blues, taping the first of a series of in-concert shows due to premiere on 
TBS-TV in January.If they accurately capture that performance, they're off to a 
great start. 
</P>
<P>
 When her debut album, "Tuesday Night Music Club," was released a year ago, 
Crow seemed an interesting but minor figure, and in concert she was tentative 
and uncertain. Now with the album having reached the Top 10 and her spunky "All 
I Wanna Do" becoming the bar-fly party anthem of the year, she's a major 
leaguer -- and Friday she performed like one. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone was any trace of uncertainty, replaced by engaging confidence. Switching 
between guitar and organ in front of a tight, bluesy, four-man band -- which 
has clearly been well-seasoned by a year on the road -- she pumped extra life 
into "Music Club" highlights like the simmering "Run, Baby, Run" and a couple 
of strong new songs. 
</P>
<P>
 And credibly tackling Led Zeppelin's reggae "D'yer Mak'er" (a neat twist on 
Zep's macho-rock) and John Lennon's "Cold Turkey," Crow cemented herself in a 
spot midway between Rickie Lee Jones' people-watching sharpie and Liz Phair's 
bold self-affirmer. STEVE HOCHMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NO KENNY G FENCE-SITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By one standard, saxophonist Kenny G's show at the Pond of Anaheim on Saturday 
night was a rousing success, deserving an A. By another, though, it rates a 
resounding F. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's take the A side first. Nobody plays lite jazz (a mellow hybrid of 
traditional jazz and Muzak) better than Kenny G -- short for Gorelick. Backed 
by five capable musicians, he performed instrumental pieces from his 
phenomenally successful albums. The numbers -- mainly ballads and medium-tempo 
numbers -- were built around his highly melodic solos, which have a romantic 
and spiritual aura that clearly turns audiences on. 
</P>
<P>
 What he's shrewdly done is zero in on an over-25 pop audience that leans 
toward melodic New Age music and may also have a vague interest in traditional 
jazz -- but finds it too complex and not melodic enough. To capture that crowd, 
he waters down the jazz, coats it with pop and soft-rock elements and pumps it 
full of melody. Add a humble, likable persona and you have a superstar who's in 
a commercial class by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's why G also merits an F. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are really into hard-core jazz wouldn't have lasted through 10 
minutes of this two-hour show. They'd thumb their noses at his solos after 
listening in vain for vestiges of soul, passion or creativity. His cloyingly 
sweet tone would be enough to drive them to the exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it wasn't easy to stomach the hokey, show-biz gimmicks -- like the old 
note-stretching trick. He'd play a single note for a well over a minute, 
eliciting oohs and ahhs from awe-struck fans who equate that with talent. Even 
worse, near the end of the show he strolled through the arena, reeling off solo 
after solo to the delight of fans thrilled by the personal contact. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've ever marveled at solos by great sax players like John Coltrane and 
Sonny Rollins, Kenny G's are, by comparison, just skin-deep and soulless, full 
of barren ideas and empty repetition. 
</P>
<P>
 How good is Kenny G? It depends on which side you're on. DENNIS HUNT

MUSIC REVIEW; DIAZ TRIO BRINGS VIRTUOSITY TO HISTORIC SITES PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virtuosically skilled, musically hyper-aggressive and completely at home with 
each other, the members of the Diaz Trio made their West Coast ensemble debut 
in the Pompeiian Room at the Doheny Mansion Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For this opening concert in the newest season of Chamber Music in Historic 
Sites, the three players -- violinist David Kim and the brothers violist 
Roberto Diaz and cellist Andres Diaz -- proved that, though they can produce 
quiet, even ruminative music, they do not often espouse gentleness. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber music, they seemed to be communicating to their sold-out audience at 
this Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College event, is a macho endeavor. 
Their colorful playing of Dohnanyi's kaleidoscopic Serenade, Opus 10, and 
Beethoven's full-blooded Trio in G, Opus 9, No. 1, certainly gave that 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest appearance at mid-program of pianist Delores Stevens in Joaquin 
Turina's A-minor Piano Quartet did nothing to contradict that sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The musically stylish, technically unflappable Stevens, playing on a 
wonderfully woody and mellow if practically ancient (circa 1887) Steinway, 
displayed again that Spanish music on old instruments can make the heart sing. 
The alert string players, as impassioned in this music as in Beethoven and 
Dohnanyi, maintained an energetic and probing performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the high point became the often neglected Opus 9 of Beethoven, which 
was given an emotionally complete yet classically contained reading, led -- one 
sensed -- by the authoritative cellist, who seems to be the center of this 
trio. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, the group offered the slow movement of Jean Francaix's Trio (1933) 
as an encore. And, for almost the first time in this evening, a sense of repose 
dominated.DANIEL CARIAGA

DANCE REVIEW; ACCENT ON STYLE IN BENITEZ FLAMENCO PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes, at the end of an unraveling day that threatens to have no end, you 
may look to performers you have come to see for clues about physical survival. 
If they are flamenco dancers, you end up saying, "Oh, I see -- you just stare 
life down.Then you rage a little and lament a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 With the five dancers of Santa Fe-based Maria Benitez Teatro Flamenco, this 
prescription was offered with a lot of style on Saturday night at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 Benitez herself dwelled in the land of smoldering gesture. For "Aires de 
Silencio," hauntingly lit by Cecilio Benitez, she gathered despair in around 
her with languid or almost jerky sweeps of her arms. In her terre a terre 
dancing, there is a sense of hardship and weighted stillness, qualities also 
found, more frenetically, in the style of Alejandro Granados. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Ramona Garduno and Sara de la Pena used their torsos more 
freely, whether shifting curved arms on which circling hands became exotic 
birds, or accomplishing quick, shuffling stomps during which all limbs seem 
dartingly to extend and return to grasp a ruffled skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most stirring extension of flamenco form (literally) came with a 
solo, simply called "Serranas," by Alfonso Simo Rodriguez. Less of a slave to 
traditional quick changes of temper, he extended stretched limbs poetically and 
sustained a melancholy mood. JENNIFER FISHER

MUSIC REVIEW; ROCKIN' WITH THE LONDON CHAMBER ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't invite the London Chamber Orchestra to your next tea party. The group, 
though founded in 1921, seems bent on juicing up the chamber orchestra scene, 
removing the stuffiness and adding a dose of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Making another stop on its first United States tour at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre Friday -- the ensemble played at USC earlier in the week -- the LCO 
showed its hand from the start. Its members are young, long-haired, slim and 
colorfully dressed. Music director Christopher Warren-Green goads his (mostly) 
standing ensemble from the concertmaster position with the jumpy energy of a 
rock singer egging on his drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not all appearances. For better or worse -- it was mostly better on 
this occasion -- this youthfulness and hipness makes its way into the 
performances. In a resonant program of Britten, Adams, Glass and Bartok, the 
ensemble charged through the music with physical aggression and rhythmic power. 
</P>
<P>
 The encore, the finale of Mozart's Divertimento, K. 136, suggested more than 
anything the limitations of this athletic approach: Played very quickly, it 
became a theatrical opportunity for fiddling madness and showy dynamics, surely 
not the sum of this music.

<P>
 But in the chug-chug minimalism of Adams' 25-minute "Shaker Loops" and Glass' 
9-minute "Company," the playing took on a thrilling and appropriate mechanistic 
quality, with heavy, steely, speedy sawing, rhythmic snazziness and coloristic 
effects not limited to beautiful ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-member string ensemble (the touring configuration) plays with taut 
precision and, matched evenly from top to bottom, produces a remarkably big 
sound. Its exaggerated musicianship may have pumped up Britten's Simple 
Symphony beyond what's called for by the characterful movement titles, but the 
total involvement of Warren-Green and his players precludes merely pleasant 
run-throughs.TIMOTHY MANGAN

VALLEY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: TO THE POLLS 
</P>

 VOTERS ROUSED: State officials expect a record voter turnout next week -- in 
the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere. The turnout was 59% in 1986, when George 
Deukmejian beat former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley for governor, and 55% in 1990, 
when Pete Wilson beat Dianne Feinstein. . . . No official turnout projections 
will be given until Friday, but acting Secretary of State Tony Miller says: 
"Interest is building. Our phones are ringing off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 HOT PROP: The hot button is Prop. 187. Last week, the illegal-immigrant 
measure had students rushing out of class to protest. Next week, it sends 
parents and others rushing to voting booths. . . . "Prop. 187 is driving this 
election," says political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. "People are far more 
interested and motivated by Prop. 187 than the governor's race or the Senate 
race." 
</P>
<P>
 ABSENTEE WAVE: More voters than ever will do no rushing at all -- they'll just 
drop a ballot in the mail. Absentee ballot applications are setting records 
(chart above). Reasons: Political campaigns increasingly promote it. And those 
who try it tend to stick with it. "Probably the wave of the future," says 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 FORTUNES OF WAR: The Valley has 14 contests -- eight Assembly races, one for 
state Senate and five for Congress. Tight campaigns: Republican Assemblyman 
James Rogan versus former federal prosecutor Adam Schiff for Glendale-Burbank 
Assembly seat. . . . Democratic Rep. Anthony Beilenson vs. Richard Sybert in 
the West Valley congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
 MADNESS OF CROWDS: Who benefits from a monster turnout? Theories conflict. One 
scenario: Anti-immigrant sentiment boosts Gov. Wilson over Kathleen Brown, 
helping other GOP candidates. . . . On the other hand: Prop. 187 attracts 
voters angry at the status quo who punish all incumbents. For certain: The 
people will speak, and some servants of the people won't like it a bit. 
Absentee Voters 
</P>
<P>
 With the election still eight days away, more absentee ballot applications 
have been requested in Los Angeles County than in any previous election: 1986: 
223,465 1990: 375,023 1994*: 391,000 * As of week of Oct. 26

MINORITY FIRMS FEELING THE PINCH TOO; DEFENSE CUTBACKS LEAVE THE 
'DISADVANTAGED' SCRAMBLING TO FIND NEW SOURCES OF BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the boom years, Southern California's vast defense industry resembled a 
rich and seemingly bottomless gold mine for minority-owned machine shops, 
cleaning companies and parts suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 African American-owned Erik A. Electronics of Monrovia, for example, a few 
years ago had grown to more than $4 million a year in sales by supplying 
electronic parts almost exclusively to defense contractors. "It (defense) has 
been good for me and my family," said Al Harris, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Harris and many of his peers are rushing distance themselves from the 
collapsing defense industry. Following the lead of other defense-dependent 
businesses, many minority entrepreneurs have slashed costs, introduced new 
products and wooed new customers, from road builders to T-shirt designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversification, however, has proven to be a difficult and time-consuming 
process. And success is not guaranteed. Many minority contractors, however, 
have little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of minority firms and small businesses go out of business. The 
reason is that they don't diversify," said Ted Rogahn, senior manager for 
McDonnell Douglas' small businesses program. "Some cannot survive unless they 
get their business restructured. We have been trying to get them to look into 
other areas . . . ground transportation, rail cars." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense slump and Southern California's other economic troubles have been 
deadly for minority contractors and suppliers of all kinds. In the past three 
years, the Southern California Regional Purchasing Councils, a group formed to 
promote the development of minority suppliers, saw its roster of more than 
5,000 firms diminish by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (slump) is serious for minorities and small business," said Hollis 
Smith, the purchasing council's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Military work has been particularly important to minority contractors. Under 
government goals, 5% of Department of Defense contracts -- or about $6 billion 
a year -- are to be awarded to small, "disadvantaged" businesses, which include 
those owned by ethnic and racial minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense contracts have been the backbone of Gardena-based Computer Circuit, 
which transforms blueprints of electronic circuits to film for use in 
manufacturing. But as the flow of defense dollars has dried up, Computer 
Circuit's sales have been halved and 20 workers have been let go. The company's 
major customer, Hughes Aircraft, is moving many of its operations out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't think of diversifying in the early '80s -- money was coming in 
left and right," said Computer Circuit owner Jose B. Ramirez. Now, instead of 
$10,000 and $20,000 government contracts, Ramirez is taking in $25 and $50 
orders from T-shirt designers who want their computer-generated artwork 
transferred to film for use in silk screening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once got offered a nice piece of change for the company," said Ramirez, 65. 
"I should have sold it. Now I'm suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to facing the same problems their white male counterparts do, 
minority contractors say they are up against a unique set burdens as they 
diversify. For many, it means having to fight continued perceptions of inferior 
quality and preferential government treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get very angry that I have to spend so much time defending my quality," 
said Linda Aceves-Dabbs, owner of Protospace, a South El Monte machine shop and 
metal coatings firm. "They (many competitors and customers) feel that you are 
getting something for free. In fact, I'm out there pounding the pavement like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of defense dollars led one minority contractor to sue the 
government. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco sided with 
Latina-owned GC Micro, a San Francisco Bay area computer supplier, and said the 
Department of Defense and major contractors must disclose the proportion of 
minority-owned firms involved in a program on a contract-by-contract basis. 
</P>
<P>
 GC President Belinda Guadarrama said the information would show that the 
government and its prime defense contractors are nowhere near to meeting the 5% 
goal for using disadvantaged businesses. Improved compliance with the rule 
would generate billions of dollars in additional revenues for the minority and 
female entrepreneurs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Defense, however, disputes Guadarrama's claim. A Pentagon 
spokesman said that 5.3% of all contracts were awarded to disadvantaged small 
businesses during fiscal 1993 -- the first year in which the 5% goal was 
exceeded. The government has yet to decide whether to appeal the court's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite continued interest in defense work, many minority contractors have 
moved quickly to find business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Singh, president and founder of PC Systems Design Corp., a Brea-based 
personal computer maker and distributor, said he has replaced orders from big 
defense contractors with others from small and medium-sized companies. The 
individual orders are smaller, Singh said, but there is less red tape and 
bureaucracy with smaller customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's working out pretty good," said Singh, whose firm relies on defense 
contracts for 25% of its sales. "A lot of these (smaller) companies are not 
fully automated, so we recommend solutions to them." 
</P>
<P>
 After he saw revenue fall off for the first time in 1992, Harris of Erik A. 
Electronics began his own diversification project. He formed a team of 
employees to work the telephones, and made 2,000 to 3,000 sales calls weekly to 
a variety of companies and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was surprised to find that Caltrans, for example, purchases large 
supplies of the electronic parts -- such as fuses and terminal boards -- that 
his 15-year-old company distributes. The state highway agency became one of his 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years, Harris has reduced his company's dependence on military 
contracts to 75% of revenue from 90% -- and the proportion should continue 
falling. He expects overall sales to rise again next year by more than 10%, to 
about $4 million, as the diversification continues to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, weaning the company off defense dollars has been more difficult than 
the 51-year-old Harris had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to be further into these (new) areas than we are today," Harris 
said. "No matter what other industry you go into, they say 'we don't want new 
suppliers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But as Southern California's defense business continues to shrink, Harris 
says, he must explore other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision was made for me," he said.

UNION PACIFIC CEO TAKES LEAVE FOR ALCOHOL REHAB; RAILROADS: DREW LEWIS' 
STARTLING DEPARTURE COMES AS COMPANY BOOSTS BID FOR RIVAL SANTA FE TO NEARLY 
$3.8 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Union Pacific Corp. said Sunday that Chairman and Chief Executive Drew Lewis, 
a former Secretary of Transportation and architect of the company's recent bid 
for rival Santa Fe Pacific Corp., is taking a leave of absence to enter an 
alcohol-treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
 The startling disclosure came as Union Pacific increased its bid for Santa Fe 
to nearly $3.8 billion, topping a $3.2-billion offer from Burlington Northern. 
A Santa Fe Pacific spokesman said the board of the Schaumburg, Ill.-based 
railroad , which originally agreed to a friendly, $2.5-billion merger with 
Burlington Northern in July, would "consider" the revised Union Pacific 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific said Lewis, who will turn 63 on Thursday, is expected to return 
to the helm of the nation's largest railroad in four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we hope," Union Pacific spokesman Tim Hartman said. "We certainly 
hope that the treatment is successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis entered "a highly respected facility" last Monday, Hartman said, adding 
that Lewis and his family have requested that no additional information be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific's revelation, which came in the middle of a detailed news 
release on the new offer for Santa Fe, highlights a murky area in corporate 
communications: No government regulations specifically address the issue of CEO 
illness. Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Stock Exchange rules 
vaguely direct public companies to reveal any information deemed "material." 
</P>
<P>
 Many chief executives consider their health to be nobody's business. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI Communications, for example, took two weeks to disclose the 1987 heart 
transplant of then Chief Executive William G. McGowan. That was the first 
public inkling that McGowan was not well, even though he had suffered a heart 
attack in December, 1986. McGowan's illness forced him to give up the daily 
stewardship of MCI in late 1991, and he died the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington-based transportation consultant Robert L. Banks, who has been 
following the railroad takeover battle, called Union Pacific's exposure of its 
top executive's drinking problem "unusual. There's no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the public auction that Union Pacific forced is unlikely to cool in Lewis' 
absence, Banks said. "Union Pacific would like to keep the status quo because 
it is the top dog. I think their motives are fairly transparent," Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have predicted troubles for their opponents with the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, which must approve all rail mergers. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific's latest offer is to exchange 0.407 share of its stock for each 
share of Santa Fe Pacific stock. The offer is worth about $20 per share based 
on the New York Stock Exchange Friday closing price of $49.125 per share for 
Union Pacific. Under Burlington Northern's last offer, Santa Fe shareholders 
would get about $17.21 per share based on Friday's closing price of Burlington 
Northern. Union Pacific said it would consider including cash in the deal, but 
offered no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who joined Union Pacific in 1986 and became chairman and chief 
executive in 1987, had built a reputation as a millionaire corporate turnaround 
specialist. He served as secretary of transportation under Ronald Reagan from 
1981 to 1983, and his tasks included breaking the notorious air traffic 
controllers strike with the firing, in 1981, of thousands of controllers who 
refused to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis returned to the private sector as chairman and chief executive of Warner 
Amex Cable Communications, then the nation's sixth-largest cable systems 
operator. He was credited with helping to restore the New York company to 
financial health during his three years there.

JAPAN GEARS UP TO BECOME MAJOR PARTICIPANT IN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Japanese industry struggles to adapt to the strengthening yen, Toshifumi 
Hirai, an official at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has 
his eyes set on the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The economics of the strong yen will probably force Japan's currently most 
profitable industries -- textiles, electronics, automobiles -- to manufacture 
offshore in developing countries, said Hirai, director of the Aircraft and 
Ordnance Division at MITI. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find new, promising, profitable high-tech industries. . . . I 
think aircraft, or space, has a market in the next century." 
</P>
<P>
 But worldwide competition in the aircraft industry is akin to a "marathon 
race" in which Japan is too weak and too far behind to even dream of taking the 
lead, Hirai added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep running to see the backs of the front runners," he said. "We 
have no intention and no capability to pass them. But we just want to keep 
running the same distance or less distance behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such modesty, Japan's efforts to develop an aircraft industry are 
taken very seriously by leading U.S. firms. MITI, after all, is famous for its 
success at nurturing industries, including steel and televisions, which later 
grew to devastate their American rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. firms, instead of seeing Japan as a threat, perceive the developments as 
part of the growing globalization of high technology industries and are 
aggressively seeking to become partners with Japanese aerospace firms -- even 
supplying technical support. 
</P>
<P>
 George David, president of United Technologies Corp., the Hartford, 
Conn.-based maker of Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, acknowledged during a 
visit to Tokyo that his firm's cooperation with Japanese companies was 
contributing to their technical abilities in aerospace. But he said he wasn't 
worried about helping to create future competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe they will be competitors anyway," he said. "I would much rather 
partner with the strongest possible competitors rather than have to meet all of 
them head-to-head in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Klaus Brauer, Boeing's chief analyst for marketing and communications, noted 
that aircraft design and manufacture is "an industry with very high risks." 
Japanese firms essentially have two choices, he said: They can "throw all their 
eggs in one basket" by picking a narrow niche to focus on as full-fledged 
competitors, or they can continue their current efforts to diversify and share 
risk with foreign partners. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, the Japanese have chosen the less-risky path of partnership. 
"That makes perfect sense to us," he said. "We see that continuing." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. occupation forces dismantled Japan's aircraft industry after World War 
II. The industry has staged a comeback in recent decades to record sales of 
$8.7 billion last year, according to the Society of Japanese Aerospace 
Companies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of the industry's output is military work for Japan's Self-Defense 
Forces, such as production of F-15 fighter jets under U.S. licenses. Much of 
the commercial work consists of producing parts for the Boeing's 767 and 777 
jetliners, and for Pratt & Whitney engines for those planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to change the ratio to about 50-50 military and commercial, said 
Shinya Kobayakawa, senior managing director of the Japan Aircraft Development 
Corp. (JADC), an umbrella organization for Japan's five key aircraft firms: 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Fuji Heavy 
Industries Ltd., ShinMaywa Industries Ltd. and Japan Aircraft Manufacturing Co. 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 A key piece of the JADC strategy is for its firms to take the leading role in 
the design and manufacture of a new small passenger jet the Japanese have 
dubbed the YSX. JADC has for several years explored building such a plane with 
an American or European partner, either in the 100-seat or 75-seat class. 
</P>
<P>
 The YSX, if built, is likely to be a multinational effort. One possible 
scenario is for JADC, Boeing and Chinese state-run aircraft manufacturers to 
cooperatively build a 100-seat airplane. Boeing, for its part, has also been 
interested for several years in building a jet of this size. Boeing and JADC 
have launched a joint feasibility study for such an airplane, but design work 
remains in the early stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese believe the YSX could satisfy a global market for passenger jets 
smaller than those of the Boeing 737 series, which seats 108 to 159 passengers. 
Estimates of expected demand over the next two decades for this kind of smaller 
jet range from 1,500 to 3,000 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese industry sees the YSX as a step toward participation in even 
bigger multinational projects, possibly including a post-Concorde supersonic 
transport or a new 600-passenger jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese aircraft manufacturers have built only one model of commercial 
airplane during the postwar period: the 60-seat YS11, a turboprop airplane made 
largely from imported parts. The YS11 was a technological success but failed 
commercially. Production was discontinued in 1972 after only 180 of the 
airplanes were sold. The Japanese conceive of the YSX as a larger and much more 
sophisticated successor to the YS11. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese manufacturers gained design and technical skills as a result of their 
participation in the development of the Boeing 777, which is just now coming 
into production. Their share in the 777 is valued at 21%, in terms of work 
performed, risk taken and profit to be shared. The five JADC firms also had a 
17% participation in the Boeing 767. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers from the JADC firms, which are primarily making large sections of 
the 777 fuselage, worked together with Boeing engineers in designing those 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of the parts that are produced for our airplanes by Japanese 
firms is very, very good," said Brauer, the Boeing analyst. "The Japanese firms 
are very highly regarded as partners here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi Heavy and Kawasaki Heavy are partners with United Technologies in 
the production of Pratt & Whitney engines for Boeing aircraft sold to Japanese 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) makes Pratt & Whitney F100 military 
engines under license for use in F-15J jet fighters, which are made by 
Mitsubishi Heavy for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the idea of controlling the means of production in one nation, and 
controlling the technology in one nation, is actually bound to be a thing of 
the past in the 21st Century," David explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to prepare ourselves for the 21st Century economy, where there is a 
globalization of resources, a globalization of technology development, a 
globalization of the means of production." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a trend is reflected in international maneuvering aimed at forming 
alliances to build a 100-seat passenger jet. 
</P>
<P>
 While Japanese firms and Boeing are conducting preliminary studies, Boeing has 
also discussed a small plane program with Taiwan and China. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea and China, meanwhile, have held their own talks about cooperating 
with a European firm to produce a small jet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the Japanese aerospace industry is interested in the YSX is 
because we want to take the initiative in the program," Mitsubishi's Hineno 
said. "But China and South Korea have the same idea. Probably China wants to 
lead the project, and South Korea is thinking the same way. It is impossible 
for every company in the world to work together on it. Probably there will be 
several groups in the future, and they will compete against each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese think they can build the small plane, but don't believe they have 
the design and sales skills to make it a commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese capabilities, however, are rapidly expanding, and the industry's 
dreams are ambitious. MITI is providing nearly $40 million a year in annual 
subsidies for research into engine systems and materials for a supersonic or 
still-faster "hypersonic" aircraft of the future, Hirai said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new supersonic transport may become reality, most likely under U.S. 
leadership, early in the 21st Century, Hirai said. When it does, Japan wants to 
be a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "National security, profitability, national pride, the good effect on other 
industries, technology spinoffs to other fields -- all these things are 
included," he explained. "It is like the Olympic games."

 Court to Hear Keating Appeal: Lincoln Savings & Loan operator Charles H. 
Keating Jr. and his son will argue Tuesday before a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals panel that their federal racketeering, conspiracy and fraud convictions 
two years ago should be overturned. Defense lawyers contend that jurors were 
tainted with knowledge of impermissible evidence, that the trial court wrongly 
refused to grant immunity to several potential defense witnesses, that the 
convictions were not supported by the evidence and that the judge erred in 
meting out prison terms of 12 years and seven months for Keating and eight 
years and one month for his son, Charles H. Keating III. They are the only 
defendants serving time for the 1989 collapse of the Irvine thrift, the 
nation's second-costliest S&L failure.

 Northridge Fashion Center Bounces Back: The Broadway department store will be 
the first merchant in the quake-devastated Northridge Fashion Center mall to 
reopen, on Friday.It will be followed Nov. 17 by Sears. The mall -- the scene 
of some of the most startling and memorable images from the Jan. 17 temblor -- 
including the dramatic rescue of a worker trapped in a collapsed parking garage 
and a destroyed Bullock's store -- had originally been scheduled to fully 
reopen by the holidays. But the damage was so extensive that the remaining 
merchants are now expected to return at various times throughout 1995.

annual meeting Tuesday to approve an intra-company merger that would 
consolidate three partially owned subsidiaries. To streamline operations and 
create a company with $500 million in sales, the Costa Mesa company wants 
shareholders of SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc., Viratek Inc. and ICN Biomedicals Inc. 
to accept one share of ICN stock for each share of their stock. The new company 
would retain the ICN Pharmaceuticals name, and Biomedicals would operate as a 
subsidiary.

 Fugitive German Tycoon Reportedly in Iran: Jurgen Schneider, a real estate 
magnate who vanished without a trace in April and left behind more than $3.3 
billion in debts, is hiding in Iran after paying hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to the Iranian government, the Sunday Times reported.The paper said 
bankers in Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt, had been told of Schneider's 
whereabouts and that he had been seen in the Iranian capital Tehran. German 
investigators discovered Schneider had prepared his hide-out in advance and 
paid "millions of deutsch marks to the Iranian authorities," the paper added. 
Schneider is wanted by German police for alleged fraud.

OPPORTUNITY IS KNOCKING IN CASABLANCA; MIDEAST: JAPANESE, EUROPEAN AND U.S. 
BUSINESSMEN MEET COUNTERPARTS FROM MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES.

 While the politicians made headlines Sunday, nearly 2,000 businessmen at a 
Middle East and North Africa economic conference swapped cards and discussed 
the future of a region at peace for the first time in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the three-day conference, opened Sunday by Morocco's King 
Hassan II, is to give potential investors a chance to meet the political movers 
and shakers in the Middle East and North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 They have come in droves. Japanese, European and U.S. businessmen registered 
for the unprecedented event for a chance to meet officials and experts from 
more than 60 countries gathered in Morocco's financial hub. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of George Vassiliou, former president of Cyprus, embracing PLO 
leader Yasser Arafat in a hotel lobby encapsulated the mood of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "This meeting is unique in that such a big number of people representing the 
business community of the world are meeting with political leaders," Vassiliou 
said.. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political leaders are giving their blessing to the whole process, and it 
opens the doors to everything else," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin is co-sponsoring the 
conference, told attendees in a message that he saw the conference as an 
important forum for discussing the region's economic prospects and promoting 
business and investment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will also make a significant contribution to advancing the peace process," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in Casablanca with Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres and eight other Israeli cabinet ministers, wants to ensure that 
Israel gets a significant chunk of the billions investors are itching to sink 
into the region, a market of more than 150 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to find new markets for Israeli goods after decades of 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel should not remain an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty," Peres 
told reporters after a series of meetings before the main conference at the 
royal palace in Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis are looking at markets to export their products, and the Arabs 
are looking for investments," Vassiliou said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of potential for privatization," said banker Max Burger-Calderon 
of the corporate finance group Apax Partners & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in telecommunications, the fastest-growing sector in the region, 
Morocco needs investments of $2 billion in the next two years, and that Israel 
is looking for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Falkowski, who heads the European Union's technical division for the 
Mediterranean region, said the purpose of the conference is to educate 
businessmen in the language of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just starting to coordinate. The purpose of this meeting is to 
mobilize the business community and tell them what is happening on the 
political front," Falkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the opening ceremony, the conference will break into working groups on a 
wide range of issues, from sharing water resources to energy, banking, finance 
and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he expects from Casablanca, Rabin said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We created an atmosphere of peace in the region and now we want to exploit 
it."

 Mexican Group Ends Bid for Westin Hotels: A group of Mexican investors led by 
businessman Bernardo Dominguez said it has decided not to buy U.S.-based Westin 
Hotels & Resorts Inc. In a press release, the Dominguez group said it had 
raised $260 million and was nearing completion on other financing arrangements 
when it chose to end its 10-month-long negotiation with Seattle, Wash.-based 
Westin."They ceased negotiations because of the increase in interest rates, the 
volatility of the high-yield bond markets and Westin's inability to achieve 
projected cash flow returns," the statement said. It said Dominguez, a 
33-year-old self-made construction tycoon, will "continue to pursue hospitality 
and other real estate ventures in the U.S. to supplement his Latin American 
investments."

 Danny Goldberg Accepts Warner Bros. Records Post: The head of Warner's 
Atlantic label has agreed to become chairman of Warner Bros.Records, sources 
said. Goldberg was tapped to succeed Mo Ostin, the legendary head of the label 
who will step down in January. Goldberg was offered the position last week 
shortly after Warner Music Group President Doug Morris gained control of the 
company's domestic music division following a battle with Warner Music Chairman 
Robert Morgado. Goldberg's appointment to the post was generally well received 
at the company, which continues to be shaken by management turmoil.

Q & A; WHAT NEW ESCROW ACCOUNT RULES MEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development unveiled rules last week that 
will enable millions of homeowners who paid too much into home-loan escrow 
accounts to recoup at least $1.5 billion in total refunds and credits. Here are 
some questions and answers on how the standards will affect homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is an escrow account? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Escrow accounts are set up by banks, thrifts and other mortgage 
lenders to ensure home buyers pay property taxes, insurance premiums and other 
loan-related charges on time. The funds that go into the account are contained 
in a homeowner's monthly mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do the new rules do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They place a clear-cut ceiling on the amount consumers may be required to 
place in escrow when buying a home. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that runs the account -- either the lender or a specialized 
"servicer" firm -- will be allowed each month to collect 1/12th of annual 
property taxes, insurance premiums or other recurring items. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also will be able to maintain a "cushion" equal to two months' 
worth of those payments. This cushion is used to cover a possible increase in a 
homeowner's property taxes or a potential default on a mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
 If a homeowner's mortgage requires a stricter standard -- say a one-month 
cushion -- that language will take priority over the federal rules. Many firms 
had required a three-month cushion, with some even requiring an eight-month 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, lenders in the future must use "aggregate" accounting when analyzing 
escrow accounts instead of "single-item" accounting, in which escrow items were 
computed separately. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did the rules come about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: HUD says use of single-item accounting was "prevalent" among lenders and 
resulted in more funds being held in escrow accounts than were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, various state attorneys general -- spurred by angry consumers -- 
filed suit against big mortgage lenders in recent years alleging escrow abuses. 
The cases brought the issue of over-escrowing into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can a homeowner know whether he or she is owed a refund or a credit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: After next April, annual escrow statements mailed to homeowners will 
contain more detailed information about their accounts. The information will be 
provided in a more readable format and designed to enable homeowners to know 
whether they are owed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers and HUD officials said it is premature now to call the firm servicing 
your mortgage because the new rules will not take effect until late April, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does a homeowner collect a refund or a credit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The company servicing the mortgage will be required to send a check if an 
escrow account contains a surplus of more than $50. For accounts with surpluses 
of less, the company can either mail a check or lower a homeowner's mortgage 
payment by applying a credit equal to the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD officials said any payments will probably be made by April, 1996, at the 
latest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many people are affected? 
</P>
<P>
 A: HUD estimates almost 6 million mortgage holders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the average likely refund or credit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: HUD figures about $150, although the amounts are expected to vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do the new rules affect future home buyers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: HUD estimates some future home buyers will pay up to $250 less in upfront 
closing costs when purchasing a house because of the change in standards.

MASSACHUSETTS INITIATIVE WOULD MUZZLE FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Massachusetts ballot question that would ban companies from spending money 
on ballot campaigns has drawn plenty of corporate interest and dollars, 
particularly from the giants of the chemical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending, supporters and opponents of the question say, is being driven by 
a fear that past ballot initiatives the companies successfully fought could be 
resurrected if the question passes.And the companies would have to stand mute. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ballot question passes on Nov. 8, Massachusetts would be the first 
state in the nation to prohibit corporations' spending money from their 
treasuries to argue for or against referenda. 
</P>
<P>
 A virtual "Who's Who" of American chemical companies have donated more than 
50% of the $1.6 million collected by opponents of the ballot question. The list 
is topped by major oil and chemical companies like Shell, Mobil and Sunoco, 
which gave $50,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The roll continues with large donations from companies such as DuPont, Dow and 
Union Carbide. Dozens of lesser-known chemical companies also contributed 
thousands of dollars against Question 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say Question 1 is unfair and, at worst, an unconstitutional 
violation of free speech. They're worried it could set a national precedent. 
They've also emphasized that the law would not only prohibit big companies from 
funding ballot question campaigns, but would also shut out small businesses and 
nonprofit corporations like hospitals and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides say the campaign is, at least partly, a grudge match between 
environmental groups and industries that have become alarmed about unsuccessful 
ballot question campaigns in 1992 designed to encourage recycling and cut toxic 
waste.

STANDARD & POOR'S DEBUTS NEW STOCK MARKET INDEX; INVESTMENT: THE SMALLCAP 600 
WILL TRACK SMALLER FIRMS IN HOTLY COMPETITIVE SECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new index makes its debut this week in the competition to create a better 
measuring stick for the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Corp., which has been in the market index business for more 
than 70 years, is introducing a gauge called the SmallCap 600 index, designed 
to track the ups and downs of the stocks of smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In that popular sector of the marketplace, it will compete for recognition 
with such other indicators as the Nasdaq composite index of what used to be 
called over-the-counter stocks, and the Russell 2000 index. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russell 2000, maintained by the investment consulting firm of Frank 
Russell Co. in Tacoma, Wash., is now widely used by investing institutions as a 
standard for small growth investing. 
</P>
<P>
 It represents the smallest two-thirds of the stocks that make up the Russell 
3000, an index that comprises 98% of the market value of issues traded in the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P says its SmallCap 600, a somewhat narrower sample than the 2000, includes 
stocks "chosen for their market size, liquidity and industry group 
representation." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Claudia Mott, an analyst at the brokerage firm of Prudential Securities, 
"I believe this new index will create serious competition for the Russell 2000 
as a benchmark and as a vehicle for passive investment (such as index funds)." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Russell Co. is touting a recent study by Value Line, the New York 
investment advisory firm, rating the Russell 3000 as a superior measure of the 
broad stock market, over such rivals as the Dow Jones industrial average and 
the S&P 500-stock composite index, which has long been the recognized standard 
for investors in large stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The index wars are heating up," says Roger Nyhus, a Russell spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of competition out there." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake for firms like S&P and Russell is a large measure of prestige and 
credibility, two important commodities in the investment world. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors in stocks or mutual funds may have something riding on 
the outcome as well, especially if they have money committed to an index fund, 
either on their own or through a pension plan or other tax-deferred retirement 
savings program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s, many billions of dollars have been invested in index funds, 
which are set up to duplicate the performance of a market index. 
</P>
<P>
 Index funds are based on the premise that the markets are "efficient," 
reflecting everything that is known or suspected about the present and future, 
and on the corollary argument that active money managers as a group cannot 
consistently beat the indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 By minimizing the need for trading and research, index funds can operate at 
lower cost than most managed funds, giving them an important advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the first generation of index funds were based on the S&P 500. As of 
Sept. 30, Lipper Analytical Services Inc. tallied 41 mutual funds, with total 
assets of more than $18 billion, constructed on that model. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, more and more index funds have been created to 
reflect different aspects of investing, such as small stocks or international 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous stock index options and futures contracts, which are used for both 
conservative and speculative investment purposes, also are based on stock 
indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, the oldest and best known market 
indicator, is not used much by professionals as a benchmark, partly because of 
the extremely small sample of stocks it represents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dow, with its historical continuity and familiarity to investors of 
all types, remains prominent in the public eye.

 Computer Smuggling Reportedly on the Rise: The country's personal computer 
industry, already dominated by imports, is now being flooded with smuggled 
computers, the state-run Beijing Youth Daily reported.In an article titled 
"Smuggling Is Murdering China's Computer Industry," the paper said imported PCs 
now account for 60% of sales in the Chinese market. But of the imports, about 
80% to 90% are smuggled, causing tax losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, 
the paper said. The Electronics Industry ministry has notified the Customs 
House to readjust import duties on computers and other related products.

 Toyota Plans Joint Venture: The auto maker has completed a feasibility study 
on the $150-million venture to assemble vehicles in Vietnam, a Vietnamese 
state-run newspaper reported.Toyota Motor Corp.'s two prospective partners are 
Agriculture Machine Corp. of Vietnam and Kuo Co. of Singapore, the Vietnam News 
Agency said. The joint venture would build an assembly plant in Vinh Phu 
province, 40 miles northwest of Hanoi, the newspaper said, quoting an 
unidentified official source. The plant would produce minivans, cars and trucks 
for domestic sale and export. Last week, Chrysler Corp. announced plans for a 
joint venture with an unidentified Vietnamese partner. Four foreign joint 
ventures are now assembling cars in Vietnam.

 Winter Wheat Crop Forecast Cut: The government has slashed its winter wheat 
crop forecast 12% to a 20-year low of 8.3 million metric tons because of the 
prolonged drought.That was down from a September forecast of 9.4 million tons. 
Australia was the world's fourth-largest wheat producer last year, with a 
harvest of 17.9 million tons. The drought, which isn't forecast to break until 
next March, is so bad that Australia has begun importing grains to feed 
livestock and is preparing to import wheat to feed people.

BANKING ON CHINA AS A TRADE GOLD MINE; ASIA: THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK HOPES TO 
BOOST U.S. BUSINESS WITH BEIJING WITH LOW-RATE LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Westinghouse Electric Corp. recently took advantage of the growing Chinese 
economy by signing a $140-million contract to supply power generators in China. 
</P>
<P>
 As with U.S. companies seeking opportunities in China, the deal was made 
possible in part by financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ex-Im Bank -- a government lending agency that seeks to boost U.S. exports 
-- hopes to play a big role in increasing U.S. corporate activity in China, 
bank Chairman Kenneth Brody said Thursday after returning from a trip to China 
promoting U.S. business there. China -- already the bank's largest lending 
market in Asia -- will become its biggest lending market in the world over the 
next few years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is single-minded: Create American jobs by financing U.S. 
exports," Brody said. The bank estimates 20,000 American export jobs will be 
created for every $1 billion that the bank lends to support U.S. trade with 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese trade analysts say there is immense potential for American companies 
to tap into the Asian nation. With a burgeoning infrastructure, China plans to 
build 60 new airports, buy airplanes, install power facilities and construct 
phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, because Chinese foreign debt is very low and growth is so strong, there 
is confidence that China will repay its loans, said Wei Li, assistant professor 
of economics at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of U.S. companies, it's the recognition that now there is a very 
specific market niche for them," said Vanessa Whitcomb, associate editor of 
China Business Review. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ex-Im Bank promotes trade through loans to foreign companies and countries 
under the condition that they will buy goods and services from American 
companies. U.S. companies who need money to begin exporting products are also 
supported through various loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank supported $1.3 billion in exports to China in its fiscal 1994, a 63% 
increase from $800 million in fiscal 1993. Applications are being reviewed for 
another $3.3 billion in support funds for future projects in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanded Ex-Im Bank financing of exports to China is part of the Clinton 
Administration's new policy to help U.S. companies compete more effectively in 
the global marketplace through what is called "Tied Aid," or government-backed 
aid.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, U.S. companies received very little support when up against 
foreign corporations that were supported by low-interest, long-term loans from 
their respective government lending organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But since 1993, under the new Clinton Administration policy, the Ex-Im Bank 
has provided its own long-term, low-rate loans -- called "soft" loans -- to aid 
U.S. exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 This will level out the playing field when American companies bid against 
foreign competitors for contracts, said Brody. "Ex-Im Bank has decided that 
getting in on the ground floor will create more opportunity for our exporters," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody met with industry ministers and heads of several large Chinese banks 
during his eight-day trip throughout the country. Thanks to China's substantial 
economic and policy reforms, the U.S. government has further expanded economic 
relations with the country. The bank is considering stationing an Ex-Im 
representative to China within the U.S. embassy there, Brody said.

 Public Works Plans Outlined: The country needs to spend $500 billion in the 
next decade on public works to ease problems that are hampering economic 
development, according to official reports. Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said 
China would have to raise more funds in overseas capital markets and seek more 
loans from international financial organizations and governments, the China 
Daily said. China's investment in infrastructure last year reached about $21.4 
billion, nearly matching the entire amount invested between 1981 and 1985, the 
report said.

 Government Issues Union Edict: All foreign-funded firms in the booming coastal 
regions have orders from Beijing to establish labor unions by the end of the 
year to safeguard workers' rights, a state-run newspaper said. The policy 
applies to all such firms that began operations before June in the coastal 
areas, which have the largest concentrations of joint ventures and other 
overseas-funded enterprises. In other regions, 60% of foreign-invested 
enterprises must begin setting up trade unions, the China Daily reported, 
quoting Yang Xinfu, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

SLEEP TIGHT, A MONSTROUS SEASON APPROACHES; MOVIES: THOSE PERENNIAL MASTERS OF

 It is a cool fall evening, only minutes after the last glow of an afternoon 
sunset has faded behind the cloak of night, and as you sit in the darkness 
waiting, you hear them coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaves that were clinging to life just days ago now lay dead beneath the 
skeletal branches, crying out involuntarily as they are smashed under the feet 
of the approaching creatures. Soon, the leaves grow silent, and you know that 
the monsters are there, right there, outside your door, and that they will not 
go away until you have looked into their ghastly faces, and satisfactorily 
answered the eternal question: 
</P>
<P>
 "Trick or treat?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah, it's Freddy Krueger, or Jason, the Mummy or the Werewolf, maybe even 
the devil himself. If the entrepreneurial ghouls have their way, and parents in 
your neighborhood are tacky enough to let their kids wear them, it could be the 
mask of O.J. staring back at you. But if this Oct. 31 is like most others 
during the past six decades, ever since Hollywood got its voice and put the 
scream in Halloween, you are sure to be visited by the perennial masters of the 
dark, the id and the ego of the Living Dead, Frankenstein's monster and Count 
Dracula. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you're really paying attention, the faces stamped out in latex are those of 
Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, whose performances in Universal's seminal 1931 
talking horror movies, "Frankenstein" and "Dracula," set the images of the 
characters forever. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 63 years since "Frankenstein" and "Dracula" were released, there have 
been countless remakes, knockoffs, spoofs and parodies. There are 32 movies 
with Dracula in the title available right now on video, 29 with Frankenstein, 
and scores more featuring either those characters or monsters sporting similar 
MOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenstein's monster and the vampire who inspired Count Dracula were 
conceived in novels, illustrated in magazines, given life on stage, transported 
to the silver screen and broadcast over the airwaves. Their stories have been 
told and retold, their powers and personalities subjected to a thousand whims 
of reinvention. They flourished during the Great Depression, survived World War 
II (and Abbott and Costello), saw aliens from outer space, psycho-killers, and 
devils of every denomination come in and out of vogue. They have even survived 
face-to-face confrontations with each other, and, at the end of the day, remain 
the dominant figures of modern horror fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are about to go after each other again, at least at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, TriStar opens "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," directed by Kenneth 
Branagh and starring Robert De Niro as the monster. A week later, Warner Bros. 
trots out Neil Jordan's "Interview With the Vampire," with Tom Cruise playing 
the vampire Lestat. 
</P>
<P>
 As this is being written, there is no advance word on the comparative quality 
of the two films, but the smart money says the vampire movie will win the 1994 
monster-off. Not just because Cruise is a bigger box-office star than De Niro, 
but because the prevailing social environment is more suited to the seductive 
wiles of vampires, and to the pleasures and dangers of sex, than to the raw 
terror of the walking dead and the theme of science run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, Frankenstein's monster, as we have come to know him in film, is 
an NFL lineman, a lumbering ox who is all scar tissue and brute force, trudging 
along without any supernatural, social or intellectual skills. Even though 
Shelley had him pining for a sweetheart, it's hard to imagine what he'd have 
done with her. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Dracula and his literary variants have been depicted as suave, 
sensual, alluring figures who move with the grace of the wind, and though they 
become petulant over the presence of garlic, crucifixes and mirrors, they 
remain relatively free of the constraints of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 As monsters, they seem to make strange bedfellows, yet they have sort of 
marched two abreast throughout 19th- and 20th-Century culture. They were, if 
legend has it right, even conceived on the same weekend in 1816, under the same 
roof, perhaps under the influence of the same drugs, in a villa near Lake 
Geneva, where Mary Shelley, her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron and a 
Dr. Polidori got together to exchange ghost stories. 
</P>
<P>
 During that decadent house party, Shelley reportedly saw the image of a 
scientist reanimating a corpse in a dream, while Dr. Polidori began a story 
that would produce his 1819 novella, "The Vampyre." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley's monster and Dr. Polidori's vampire were conceived as sort of 
freakish peers, products of their own excessive environment. Though feminist 
writers have suggested that Shelley's story was an allegory about the male 
desire to procreate without having to put up with women, she gave the more 
reasonable explanation that she was stimulated by theories of how electricity 
might be used to raise the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the original monster that her Dr. Victor Frankenstein assembled 
from spare parts found in graveyards and morgues was an intelligent creature 
who, though he looked a fright, could function within society. He could speak 
several languages, and was driven not by some quest for spiritual light, like 
that big lug Boris Karloff played, but by anger and revenge, a desire to smash 
the godhead science that made him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Polidori's vampire was also a product of the author's cultural background, 
a suave rake whose nocturnal lifestyle and perverse pleasures seem only a few 
degrees removed from the lives of some early 19th-Century aristocrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Bram Stoker, a product of the Victorian Era, scruffed up the vampire's image 
and buried Polidori's sexual imagery in his 1897 novel, "Dracula," making the 
count a pasty, decrepit old man. He is about as seductive as a mosquito, a 
thief in the night, slipping into the boudoirs of sweet-blooded maidens, and 
feasting as they sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The vampire became even more ghastly in F. W. Murnau's 1922 silent movie, 
"Nosferatu," an unauthorized adaptation of "Dracula," featuring a rat-faced, 
long-eared Count Orlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that, Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi combined some of the 
aristocratic bearing of Dr. Polidori's vampire with the Transylvanian mystery 
of Stoker's Dracula in a hugely successful stage production, then reprised it 
in Tod Browning's 1931 movie, and the character, as he is most commonly known, 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Frankenstein's monster underwent a personality change. 
Shelley's story was too horrific for movie audiences trying to get used to the 
shock of people talking in movies, let alone screaming. And by then, mad 
scientists trying to play god seemed a realistic threat to rational people. So 
Universal turned the monster into a pure victim of science, the confused 
creation of a mad grave robber, who killed only by accident, or when 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" launched a decade of horror movies in Hollywood, 
and spawned sequels -- "Dracula's Daughter" and "The Bride of Frankenstein" -- 
considered today to be better than the originals. But the onslaught of 
competitive monsters, plus the advent of the atomic age, shunted the classics 
aside, or turned them into comic relief in "Abbott and Costello Meet 
Frankenstein," or into gentle suburbanites in "The Addams Family" and "The 
Munsters." 
</P>
<P>
 England's Hammer Films made a series of blood-soaked but fairly faithful 
Frankenstein and Dracula movies in the '50s and '60s, and with the 1974 "Young 
Frankenstein," Mel Brooks made what may be the best and most affectionate genre 
spoof in Hollywood history. But the monsters' images could use some sprucing 
up, which is what they may be about to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Branagh's version of the Frankenstein story hews closely to Shelley's original 
story line, which has the monster murdering the doctor's brother and wife and 
chasing him halfway around the world. And Jordan's adaptation of "Interview 
With the Vampire" will be a major disappointment if it doesn't capture the 
seductive atmosphere of Rice's novel. 
</P>
<P>
 The oddity of the two subjects is that while "Frankenstein" began life as the 
philosophical work -- a cautionary tale about man going against nature -- and 
the vampire stories as pure horror entertainment, they have temporarily 
switched positions in the '90s. Even though man is tinkering with nature as he 
never has before, society is less panicked by what science might accomplish 
than by what it cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 The vampire stories, with their inherent linking of sexuality, blood and 
death, the mystery and power of the combination, make them seem as if they are 
allegories foretold. As ridiculous as things got in Francis Ford Coppola's 
over-the-top 1992 "Bram Stoker's Dracula," it was impossible to watch the 
count's infecting of Mina with his blood and not see it as a sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
 There may come a time when the mad scientist reclaims his ranking as a 
fearsome menace -- there are people out there we don't want to see cloned, for 
instance -- but for now, Dr. Frankenstein seems a benign threat, and his 
monster goes comparatively gentle into the night.

 "Nosferatu" (1922). German Expressionist F.W. Murnau turned Dracula into a 
rat-faced monster, more reminiscent of an anorexic fruit bat than an Eastern 
European aristocrat, but he was a fright.

 * "Dracula" (1931). Bela Lugosi's trance-like glare and comedic timing ("I 
don't drink . . . wine") gave the world a new view of Bram Stoker's 
Transylvanian count.

 * "Dracula's Daughter" (1936). The homoerotic undercurrents of this film 
reportedly provided inspiration for "Interview With the Vampire" author Anne 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Horror of Dracula" (1958). The first of the British Hammer Films full-color

RIORDAN BACKS FEINSTEIN; RIVAL DOUBTS IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entering the fierce, final stretch of the campaign, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
picked up a major endorsement Sunday from Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and 
accused her opponent of hiding behind his wife in the political uproar that 
followed disclosures that the couple had employed an illegal immigrant as a 
nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Mike Huffington, interviewed on a nationally televised 
news show, downplayed the significance of the Riordan endorsement and defended 
his actions in the hiring of the illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out about it -- that she was illegal -- I asked my wife to fire 
her," Huffington said. "But my wife, unfortunately, has a heart of gold and our 
daughter (who) was 2 years old at the time, had fallen in love . . . with this 
lady and it tore my wife's heart out to have to separate the two." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his support for Proposition 187, Huffington said he hoped that 
illegal immigrant children barred from public schools by the measure would be 
sent to private schools or educated at home -- a suggestion that Feinstein 
later dubbed "sheer nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, in sharply criticizing the Santa Barbara congressman, on Sunday for 
the first time raised the issue of Arianna Huffington's role in what Feinstein 
called a religious "cult." Arianna Huffington has said she was a member and 
minister in the Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness in Los 
Angeles, but she has described it as a religious institute and says she no 
longer is active in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's remarks drew an angry response from the Huffington campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The back-and-forth of the day underscored the continuing nastiness of a close 
Senate race that long ago became the costliest congressional contest in U.S. 
history. As of last week, Republican Huffington reported spending $25.2 
million, most of it from his personal fortune, with another $10.7 million spent 
by Democrat Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 At a morning news conference, Feinstein received the politically significant 
endorsement of Riordan, a wealthy Republican businessman who -- like Huffington 
-- had no government service before bankrolling a successful campaign for high 
political office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am supporting Dianne Feinstein because she has shown an amazing ability to 
work with Republicans and Democrats to help solve the problems of Los Angeles 
and California," Riordan said at the Studio City event, joined by Feinstein and 
scores of her supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dianne is a proven person to me. She is a strong leader. She has come through 
for Los Angeles in many ways: the crime bill, the (federal emergency) economic 
package after the (Northridge) earthquake," Riordan told reporters. "She has 
used her experience as a mayor to really be of tremendous assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's action hearkened to last week's endorsement of New York Democratic 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo by New York City's Republican Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
And while California voters may not be as partisan as New York's, the import of 
Riordan's endorsement was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 William Schneider, political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in 
Washington, said, "It is significant because it gives her a boost in Southern 
California, which is not where she is strong. It is not just the city of Los 
Angeles. It is the whole media market, where Mayor Riordan is not only 
well-known but popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his speech and during subsequent remarks to reporters, Riordan had 
only good things to say about Feinstein but avoided any criticism of 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that Huffington called his endorsement inconsequential and the result of 
political pressure by Democratic aides to the mayor, Riordan quipped, "Words 
are cheap in politics." He added, "This decision was based on what I think is 
best for the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Feinstein did not hesitate to lay into her opponent for 
accusing her -- so far without any substantiation -- of employing illegal 
immigrants at her home in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 That claim has been made by Huffington several times since he and his wife 
admitted last Thursday that they had employed an illegal immigrant for more 
than four years as a nanny to their children. The admission that he broke 
immigration and tax laws has broadsided Huffington's campaign, all the more so 
because he vigorously supports Proposition 187, the ballot measure that seeks 
to end education and health services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Huffington repeatedly has said his wife was responsible for 
running the household and hiring the nanny, Feinstein said Huffington has a 
history of blaming others for his problems and lying for political gain. An 
example, she said, was his claim that she has hired illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's false and it's one of the the things he does," an angry Feinstein told 
reporters. "He can't accept responsibility and he doesn't tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. And now he's trying to 
say, 'Well, somebody else told me to do it,' or 'Somebody else put their hands 
in the cookie jar too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Feinstein raised the politically sensitive topic of Arianna 
Huffington's involvement with the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, 
contending that the candidate had denied that his wife was a member of a 
"cult." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think the proof is she was?" a reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, there is no question in my mind," Feinstein replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Feinstein's campaign manager Kam Kuwata attempted to clarify 
Feinstein's remarks. "The cult is not an issue. The lie is the issue," Kuwata 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's remarks were immediately derided by Ken Khachigian, a veteran GOP 
consultant and senior adviser to the Huffington campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Dianne has lost it," Khachigian said. "The man held a press 
conference. If he wanted to hide behind his wife, he would have sent her out by 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 The reference to Arianna Huffington's personal beliefs, he charged, was 
inappropriate. "It is totally irrelevant to whether Mike Huffington is 
qualified to be a U.S. senator." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Sunday, the controversy over the illegal immigrant issue dominated 
Huffington's interview on the nationally broadcast "This Week With David 
Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked several times about the hiring of the nanny and its seeming conflict 
with his support for Proposition 187, Huffington said there was no conflict. He 
said the real issue in the immigration debate is taxpayer-funded services, not 
hiring illegal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to pay from their pocket into the state treasury and have 
the state treasury pay for welfare payments and other payments," he said. "So 
that is a separate issue" from employing an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your campaign, of course, has been convulsed in recent days by the revelation 
that you, for a number of years, had in your employment an illegal immigrant . 
. . . how does someone get to late October of a Senate campaign without dealing 
with this issue?" asked the nationally syndicated and politically conservative 
columnist George F. Will. 
</P>
<P>
 In responding to that question and others, Huffington repeatedly referred to 
his wife and eldest daughter as the reason that the woman was hired and kept as 
an employee in violation of federal law. He said his reference to his wife was 
an explanation, not an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife hired her, my wife paid for her and I asked my wife to let her go," 
he said, adding later: "I disagreed with my wife. But I'm taking responsibility 
for my wife's actions." 
</P>
<P>
 When Will asked about the impact of Proposition 187 on illegal immigrant 
children who would be barred from schools, Huffington suggested that they could 
be sent to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I would hope . . . that in many cases the parents would still pay for 
some type of education for their children, even if it's home schooling or 
teaching them themselves," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Huffington," Will responded, "is it realistic to expect the parents of 
these children, who are themselves probably working at least one job, scraping 
to make ends meet, to invest in private education or to stay home and teach 
their children?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Huffington said, "hopefully some have grandparents, some have aunts or 
uncles, some have people that are retired who can help teach the kids. But the 
point is, the state should not be forced to tax taxpayers in California to pay 
for illegal immigrants' education. It makes no sense whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said Riordan's endorsement of Feinstein meant nothing to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about endorsements," he said, reminding viewers that his 
congressional opponent two years ago was a veteran Republican supported by 
George Bush and Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only want the votes of the people and I'm a populist," he said. "And I 
don't care about the liberal media either." 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, Huffington appeared with several other candidates, including 
Gov. Wilson and state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, at a Republican Party 
steak-and-oyster feed in Elk Grove. But he did not speak to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters asked him about the nanny controversy as he mingled with the guests, 
and he said: "My wife did the hiring. I technically did not break the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, asked what significance he thinks the matter will play in the 
campaign, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end . . . there will be a few people who may . . . but I'll tell you 
what, most of them are concerned about their taxes going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to this story were Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub and 
research librarian Paul J. Singleton. Huffingtons' Actions Could Have Breached 
2 Statutes 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate Mike Huffington is expected to approach two federal 
agencies today to negotiate penalties for hiring an illegal immigrant and not 
paying the proper taxes for the employee. The two agencies are the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service and the Internal Revenue Service. Here are the two 
laws that Huffington and his wife Arianna may have broken: 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration Reform and Control Act -- Signed by President Ronald Reagan in 
1986, this law makes it a crime to hire illegal immigrants and requires 
employers to verify their workers' citizenship status. The act provides civil 
penalties of as much as $10,000 for each illegal immigrant hired. Repeat 
offenders face up to six months' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Insurance Contributions Act -- Passed in 1954, this statute 
requires employers to pay Social Security taxes and sometimes other taxes for 
household workers earning more than $50 for each three-month period. In case of 
delinquency, employers are responsible for paying back taxes, plus interest, 
and may be subject to fines of up to 48% of the total tax.

UNCERTAINTY, LAWSUITS WOULD GREET PROP. 187; ELECTION: MANY HOSPITALS, CLINICS 
HAVE YET TO PREPARE CONTINGENCY PLANS. DISOBEDIENCE AND CONFUSION PREDICTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 is approved by California voters, most of its get-tough 
provisions eliminating government services to illegal immigrants would be 
scheduled to take effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with little more than a week before Election Day, many hospitals, 
clinics and government entities -- confused by the measure's broad wording or 
concerned about its harsh consequences and hopeful that it will be rejected 
either by state voters or by the courts afterward -- have yet to prepare 
contingency plans for implementing the sweeping initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials say they don't plan to give guidance to local hospitals 
and clinics until after the election, and are not yet sure how they will 
provide such basic services as communicable disease control because of the 
wording of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters further are petitions being circulated among health care 
professionals pledging their refusal to implement the initiative, which would 
require personnel at most hospitals and clinics to refuse non-emergency 
treatment to illegal immigrants and to report the names of suspected illegal 
immigrants to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overlay of civil disobedience, general confusion, lawsuits and 
uncertainty about how to apply the law will result in great chaos," predicted 
David Langness, a vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at this point, one of the few certainties is that if Proposition 187 
is approved Nov. 8, a flurry of lawsuits will be filed in federal and state 
courts across California beginning Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "The celebration election night will be very short," acknowledged Ronald 
Prince, co-chair of the pro-187 campaign committee, "because we'll have to be 
in court the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the California Medical Assn., the California Assn. of Hospitals, 
the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the National 
Immigration Law Center, among other groups, are currently ensconced at their 
computer terminals, preparing lawsuits to thwart the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to talk about a lawyer's employment program, this is it," said 
one such attorney, Peter D. Roos of the Bay Area-based Multi Cultural Education 
Training and Advocacy Inc. "The O.J. case is a whodunit -- it's simple compared 
to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-187 lawyers say the issues to be covered will range from the 
constitutionality of Proposition 187's key educational provisions to whether 
California voters even have the right to consider wide-ranging immigration 
questions, since immigration is generally within the purview of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the fact the federal government constitutionally has basically 
been given the responsibility of dealing with immigration -- and this proposal 
defines legal residency status differently than the way the federal government 
does -- there is a clear conflict there," said Lilly Spitz, staff attorney for 
the California Assn. of Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU of Southern California is considering filing a comprehensive suit on 
behalf of several organizations to scuttle the measure's impact on about 15 
health and social services programs. However, ACLU legal director Mark 
Rosenbaum said that at this point, he prefers to focus on Election Day rather 
than the day after. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ballot box is the only 100% certain way to defeat the measure," he said, 
"and litigation, if required, is going to be time consuming, enormously 
divisive and expensive beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, Rosenbaum asserted that the initiative, co-authored by Harold 
Ezell, former INS Western regional commissioner and fast-food executive, is 
chock full of legal flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This measure is like target practice against the Constitution," Rosenbaum 
said. "It was written by a hot dog executive, with the same level of 
sophistication as stuffing a hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, the head of the pro-187 campaign, refuses to discuss legal issues. "We 
can't help you there," he said. "We don't have a lawyer who wouldn't charge to 
consult with you on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative co-author Alan Nelson, an attorney, says he expects the state 
attorney general's office to deal with a barrage of lawsuits, but he is 
confident the measure will hold up. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure "ought not to be so specific as to cover every nitty-gritty 
thing," he said. "It sets forth the general principles and we'd have the state 
follow up with regulations and implementing procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballot measures often spawn long and costly lawsuits -- the insurance reform 
measure, Proposition 103, is a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 187 is different in one key regard: Its sponsors are actually 
inviting litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1982 case of Plyler vs. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 
unconstitutional a Texas law eliminating a free public school education for 
illegal immigrant children. By asking California voters to banish illegal 
immigrants from schools, Proposition 187 sponsors are essentially asking the 
electorate to authorize a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to request the court to take 
another look at the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the initiative is to have the court revisit and reconsider the 
Plyler decision," Nelson said. "Passage of the initiative will provide that 
vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those planning challenges of the measure's schooling ban if it passes 
are attorney Roos, of Multi Cultural Education Training and Advocacy, and Peter 
A. Schey, who heads the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law. Both attorneys appeared before the Supreme Court more than 
a decade ago to successfully argue the Plyler vs. Doe case. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the basic issue has already been adjudicated once, constitutional law 
experts say, the initiative is bound to speedily make its way back to the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it went first to either the state or federal court system, all the lower 
courts would have to declare it unconstitutional because only the Supreme Court 
could overrule Plyler vs. Doe," said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the measure's public school provisions would not take effect until 
Jan. 1, 1995, school suits might not be filed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Schey, for one, said he probably will hold off until state government agencies 
make clear "how they intend to interpret the measure's very ambiguous 
provisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office, as it routinely does, is preparing to 
defend the ballot measure. "You can imagine how quickly legal actions will be 
filed," said spokesman David Puglia. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, meanwhile, say they are fielding calls from parents worried 
about the repercussions of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's rumors, confusion and a lack of understanding of how initiatives 
work," said Los Angeles Board of Education President Mark Slavkin. "We're 
trying to get out the message that children should keep coming to school. 
That's where they belong. If there is to be a change in our practices and 
procedures, we'll let people know." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the schooling ban were declared unconstitutional, other portions of 
the measure could still take effect due to a severability clause in the 
initiative. Since these portions, covering health care, social services and law 
enforcement, do not include implementation dates, they are scheduled to go into 
effect immediately upon passage, according to the secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any initiative, if regulations are needed to clarify it or have to be 
promulgated to implement it, they will," said Leslie Goodman, director of 
communications for Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first expected to file lawsuits is the Los Angeles-based National 
Immigration Law Center, which plans to seek an immediate federal court ruling 
on behalf of immigrants who claim they are entitled to full Medi-Cal benefits 
but do not have documents readily available to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Center attorney Charles Wheeler said the suit would be designed to enforce a 
1991 federal ruling ordering state officials to provide full benefits while 
giving immigrants "a reasonable opportunity" to obtain necessary documents. The 
injunction also covers undocumented immigrants the INS is aware of but is not 
considering deporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential lawsuits would attack the entire initiative on constitutional 
or statutory grounds. For example, the requirement for reporting people 
reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants to federal authorities raises 
discrimination issues, said Spitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "By attempting to treat people differently because of their accent, dress and 
their ethnicity, the law on its face would be unconstitutional," she contended. 
</P>
<P>
 With the measure continuing to receive slightly more than 50% support in 
pre-election polls, officials of health care facilities and government agencies 
that would be directly impacted say they have little direction on how to 
proceed if the measure wins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, which cares 
for children who have been abused or abandoned, generally has about 200 
undocumented children under its wing at any given time. Because the measure's 
ban on social services for illegal immigrants lists no exception for children, 
department Director Peter Digre says he is caught between a rock and a hard 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe the public in any way intends if we find a battered 
2-year-old toddler that we not remove the toddler from the situation," said 
Digre. "Our responsibilities are outlined in great detail in (federal law) . . 
. and we have a whole network of court orders that tell us what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-author Nelson said last week he wasn't fully clear about the measure's 
intent on abused and abandoned children, since he didn't draft that section. 
"But if they are illegally in the country, they shouldn't be getting publicly 
funded benefits and that would include foster care," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission is awaiting word from the city attorney's 
office on whether to revise its policy of limited cooperation with the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Commission. The ballot measure calls for police 
to verify the legal status of any person arrested if he or she is suspected of 
being an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we only notify the INS if we have someone arrested and charged with 
a felony and (the person) is found guilty in court," said Chief Willie L. 
Williams. "Technically, when you stop someone for a traffic violation, that's 
an arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, says Langness, Southern California hospitals and health clinics 
also have not yet formulated plans to implement Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the measure will be defeated, and if it passes, we anticipate court 
action that will last a long time," he said, "We have also heard from many 
clinics and several hospitals that petitions are circulating among doctors and 
nurses . . . saying they will refuse to implement 187 if it passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson responded that "promoting anarchy is a big P.R. gimmick. You have to 
believe most people will adhere to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Free Clinic, for one, is considering a third option: setting 
up a parallel clinic funded entirely by private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not as public health providers in good conscience turn people away 
who need health care," said Executive Director Mary Rainwater. "It violates 
every principle that we hold . . . that health care is a basic human right." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the state Department of Health Services, seeking to meet the 
wishes of the Wilson Administration, has been working on directives to be 
issued to hospitals and clinics shortly after Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the state to advise hospitals to continue treating anyone who 
bears a full-scale Medi-Cal card, said Deputy Director Elisabeth C. Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means they're not undocumented aliens and already have been found by our 
department to have an appropriate immigrant status," said Brandt, the agency's 
chief counsel. "We want to be sure providers don't discriminate against anyone 
based on suspected alien status when we've already gone through that. That 
would be a real problem with federal laws and jeopardize federal medical 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Such advice, however, appears at odds with the aims of initiative sponsors, 
who have argued illegal immigrants now receive government funds for which they 
are ineligible because of the ease of obtaining fraudulent documents. Moreover, 
Gov. Pete Wilson, one of the leading proponents of Proposition 187, has called 
for the issuance of new tamper-proof ID cards to provide proof of legal 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt said the state government is also considering becoming directly 
involved in administering immunizations because the measure forbids publicly 
funded hospitals and clinics from serving illegal immigrants. Such action would 
come in large part, Brandt said, because Wilson has indicated to the agency 
that he doesn't want to place the larger population at risk of contagious 
disease if Proposition 187 wins approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initiative doesn't say the government can't pay for the service," 
asserted Brandt . "It says the (hospital or clinic) facility may not provide 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such thinking, however, appears to fly in the face of the measure's intent. 
Its authors have made clear time and again their main goal is to prevent 
government funds from being spent on illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as giving free medical aid to every other person here illegally, you 
have to say no," Ezell said recently. "If it's immunizations, let some of the 
private groups pay for some of this stuff. Let MALDEF (the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund) open a clinic for it. Let the Ford 
Foundation pay for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Meissner, INS commissioner, is cautious about discussing how her agency 
would go about enforcing Proposition 187 if it becomes law. Under the measure, 
hospitals, schools and some others government entities are directed to report 
people suspected of being illegal immigrants to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time we have not made any special preparations," she said recently, 
though she acknowledged the measure would strain the overburdened immigration 
service.

TIMES O.C. POLL; PROP. 187 HAS EVEN BACKERS A BIT UNEASY; ALTHOUGH IT STILL HAS 
SUBSTANTIAL APPROVAL, 62% SAY THEY WOULD NOT TURN IN AN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT -- 
WHICH INITIATIVE WOULD REQUIRE OF SOME.

<P>
 Deep within the epicenter of the Proposition 187 movement, there's shuddering 
among supporters who feel uneasy about the measure's ban on public education 
for illegal immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County voters still favor the initiative by a solid 60% to 33%, but a 
majority said they would not alert authorities about illegal immigrant 
students, a Times Orange County Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-two percent of the voters said they would not turn in an undocumented 
student -- something that would be required of education, health and law 
enforcement officials under one of the measure's more controversial provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reservations may indicate soft support, according to Mark Baldassare, 
chairman of Urban and Regional Planning at the UCI School of Ecology, who 
conducted the poll. "And as people learn more, they could become more 
uncomfortable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, illegal immigration remains a troubling issue for most voters in 
Orange County, the birthplace of the so-called "Save Our State" ballot 
initiative that would deny non-emergency health care, education and social 
services to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-eight percent said they considered illegal immigration a big problem in 
Orange County. And their choices in major state races tended to mirror their 
views on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who has been stumping for immigration reform with 
his television ads, has steadily amassed a huge lead over his challenger, 
Democrat Kathleen Brown, with the governor favored 62% to 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson gained 10 points since the last Times Orange County Poll in May, 
shoring up his base with overwhelming support from 83% of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Those margins provide Wilson with a critical edge in the fertile Republican 
territory of Orange County, which Republicans need for a statewide victory. 
Four years ago, Wilson won Orange County with 63% of the vote, enabling him to 
narrowly defeat Dianne Feinstein in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Also leading in Orange County is Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington, 
who recently declared his support for Proposition 187. Huffington is ahead of 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by 54% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington appears to be running in place, his level of support remaining 
unchanged since a similar poll done in May. His present lead is not enough to 
guarantee a state victory since Republican candidates typically need a 2-to-1 
lead in Orange County to offset voting in the Democratic strongholds of San 
Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Dan Lungren commands such a lead in his race for attorney general, 
with voters favoring him by 48% to Democrat Tom Umberg's 22%. Twenty-seven 
percent remain undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone poll of 600 registered Orange County voters was conducted from 
Oct. 22 through last Tuesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said the governor's Orange County lead is particularly important 
for Wilson because he needs those votes as the race tightens statewide. Equally 
significant, he said, is that Huffington has not been able to build on his 
Orange County lead in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Huffington are drawing voters who overwhelmingly approve of the 
immigration reform measure. Seventy-three percent of Wilson's supporters and 
76% of Huffington's backers intend to vote for Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 However, these voters do not expect the initiative to solve the thorny problem 
of illegal immigration: Just 20% think the measure will make a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporter David Buening, 38, of Cypress fully expects the measure to be tossed 
out by the courts. And yet he still plans to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just to send a message," he said. "It will be ruled unconstitutional. 
But that's probably one of the reasons why I'm going to vote for it. I don't 
necessarily agree with it all the way. . . . While I agree with the fact of 
denying public services to illegal immigrants, I would let them at least get 
inoculations against tuberculosis." 
</P>
<P>
 Within Buening's own household, the Proposition 187 debate rages between him 
and his wife, a German immigrant who is vehemently opposed. Buening also has 
some doubts about turning in an undocumented immigrant to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know now," he said. "I guess I probably would although I don't know 
any illegal aliens myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rancho Santa Margarita, the same fierce debate is taking place between Mary 
Lou Rodriguez and some of her relatives who support Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 41, a U.S. citizen and native of Mexico, will vote against the 
measure because she fears it threatens her privacy and constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel this is a legal way to discriminate," she said. "I don't want to 
subject my daughter to being questioned for documents. I personally don't want 
to be questioned and sometimes I think it will get to this fine point. Why 
should everyone be policed by some other individual? That's a police state." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the voters' opinions are much more volatile in an initiative 
campaign. Voters make up their minds fairly late and if they are confused or 
undecided they're more likely to vote no, according to David B. Magleby, a 
Brigham Young University political scientist who has extensively researched the 
initiative process. 
</P>
<P>
 "To date in the campaign, the issue was defined as a way to send a message 
about illegal immigration -- it costs too much. Now the opponents have found 
ways to raise doubts about Orwellian life," Magleby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vague concerns of supporters provide an opportunity for the opposition, he 
said. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted 
October 22-25 on weekday nights and weekend days. A computer-generated random 
sample of telephone numbers was used. Once a household was reached, we asked to 
speak with a registered voter. The margin of error for the total sample is plus 
or minus 4% at the 95% confidence level. That means it is 95% certain the 
results are within 4 percentage points of what they would be if every 
registered voter in Orange County were interviewed. For subgroups, such as 
likely voters, the margin of error would be larger (plus or minus 5%). 
Proposition 187, Wilson Winning 
</P>
<P>
 Although an six in 10 county voters support Proposition 187, the same number 
say they would not report it if they knew of an illegal immigrant child 
attending a local school. Support for the proposition follows political views, 
with liberals most in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would make illegal immigrants ineligible for public social 
services,public health care services (unless an emergency under federal law), 
and attendance atpublic schools, and require state and local agencies to report 
suspected illegalimmigrants. If the election were held today, would you vote 
yes or no on Proposition187? 05,12,12,09,10,14 All Voters Liberal Moderate

 The Races 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has built a huge lead over Kathleen Brown, doubling the 
margin he enjoyed in May. Rep. Mike Huffington enjoys a somewhat larger lead 
over Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Huffington has not increased his share of the vote 
but has apparently persuaded some to abandon their earlier support for 
Feinstein. Incumbent Attorney General Dan Lungren holds a 2-1 edge over 
Democratic challenger Tom Umberg with one voter in four still undecided.

COLUMN ONE; INFORMERS WANT ISRAEL TO PAY UP; AS PEACE TALKS CONTINUE, 
PALESTINIAN COLLABORATORS DEMAND REWARDS AND RELOCATION. BUT EFFORTS TO GIVE 
THEM NEW LIVES ARE CLOUDED BY HOSTILITY FROM BOTH ARABS AND JEWS.

<P>
 The way Afif Khalil sees it, Israel owes him a lot for his contributions to 
state security. Starting in 1974, Khalil, a burly Palestinian who has worked as 
a building contractor and a taxi driver, began informing on his neighbors in 
Kfar Shufa, a northern West Bank village. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never killed anyone," he says emphatically. "I was responsible for 10 or 20 
arrests, but I never got anyone killed." 
</P>
<P>
 His work for the Shin Bet -- the Israeli secret police -- earned him enough to 
build a large house, drive a nice car and live well. Authorities gave him a gun 
and the village's only telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalil says his neighbors tolerated his ostensibly secret work -- until the 
intifada , the Palestinian uprising, erupted in the territories in December, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as nationalist fervor spread, life turned sour for Khalil and thousands 
of other collaborators, who helped Israel maintain its grip on the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip with relatively few troops by keeping security services informed 
of the actions and planned actions of would-be Palestinian guerrillas and other 
opponents of the occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 942 Palestinians were killed by other Palestinians in the 
territories between the start of the intifada and November, 1993, according to 
the Israeli army. The army estimates that as many as 40% of those casualties 
were collaborators, although their efforts were supposedly secret. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as Israel speeds up negotiations with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization over redeploying Israeli troops in the West Bank and ceding much 
authority there to Palestinians, the question of what to do about Khalil and 
other collaborators has pushed its way onto the national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 With increasing boldness, collaborators are raising what once was a taboo 
subject, publicly demanding resettlement inside Israel or abroad, pensions and 
compensation for lost property. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred families of collaborators have already been resettled across 
Israel, usually in towns with mixed Arab-Jewish populations. Until now, their 
predicaments were handled on a case-by-case basis by whichever branch of the 
Israeli bureaucracy originally hired them. 
</P>
<P>
 But both the government and the collaborators now feel that approach is no 
longer good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has established an interagency task force to 
devise a policy on how Israel should compensate and protect collaborators. He 
has said they deserve Israel's gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 But collaborators who already have resettled inside Israel's pre-1967 borders 
have often met with protests and hostility. Both Jews and Arabs don't 
appreciate those who, under Israeli protection, had so often so conspicuously 
bullied their neighbors, flouted local laws, lived beyond their means and 
divulged others' secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Arabs and Jews who fear that collaborators may be moved into their 
communities are raising noisy objections to government relocation plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the most difficult families, from the standpoint of socioeconomic 
issues," said Sami Albo, head of the Lev Yafo neighborhood committee, which 
represents the largely Jewish part of Jaffa. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffa, an ancient port city, was incorporated into Tel Aviv in the 1950s and 
has a mixed Jewish-Arab population that lives in uneasy coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Albo, who has lived in Jaffa since childhood, says the collaborators threaten 
to disrupt the delicate balance between Arabs and Jews: Arabs hate 
collaborators because they betrayed their people, and Jews fear them because 
they often have criminal records and remain armed even after relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't collaborate because of ideology," Albo said. "They collaborated 
to solve their problems or for their own economic interests. When they come 
here, they continue to do all the negative things they did under the protection 
of the Establishment in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 "They use and sell drugs, they engage in prostitution, they commit crimes," he 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sentiments have sparked public protests in Jaffa and made the 
collaborators' fate a bitter point of dispute between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin has linked the release of the remaining 4,000 Palestinians in Israeli 
jails to the Palestinian Authority's issuing a blanket pardon for all 
collaborators. The authority has rejected any such linkage. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials acknowledge that they have yet to decide what their 
policy should be -- whether collaborators should be rehabilitated or punished 
for past offenses. "This issue is still very much under discussion within the 
government," said Intisar Wazir, social affairs minister for the Palestinian 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalil, who now lives with his wife and eight children in a three-bedroom 
apartment on a decrepit commercial street of Jaffa, accuses the Israeli 
government of acting in bad faith toward the collaborators. He acknowledges 
that the Shin Bet gave him the apartment rent-free but contends it was so 
dilapidated that he had to spend thousands of dollars to refurbish it. The 
agency also helped him find a job as a bus driver, but Khalil complains that 
the pay is too low to support his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children don't have shoes for the winter, they don't have books for 
school," Khalil complained. He said he earns about one-quarter of the pay he 
earned in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 10, he protested in front of the prime minister's residence in 
Jerusalem, demanding more money for himself and a clear policy toward 
compensating all collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Shin Bet is not keeping its promises, and that's not good," said Khalil, 
who wants to contact other collaborators and form an organization that can "put 
strong pressure on the Shin Bet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli government has seemed surprised that the relocation is causing 
such problems. Authorities, reluctant to discuss collaborators publicly, 
decline to say exactly how many have been relocated but insist that most have 
quietly settled into their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been dramatic exceptions: In one of the more gruesome attacks, a 
well-known collaborator in Kabatiya, in the West Bank, was killed after 
hundreds of villagers laid siege to his house for several hours, finally 
breaking in to stab him to death. The man had used his telephone to frantically 
call the Israeli army for help, but no one arrived until after his killing. 
Soldiers found his body hanging from a lamppost. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of other collaborator families have resettled in Israeli towns since 
the start of the intifada.  
</P>
<P>
 The Shin Bet hoped that relocated families would blend in with their new urban 
neighbors. Jaffa was a favored spot because it is divided into two 
neighborhoods, one mostly Jewish, the other mostly Arab. Collaborators were 
moved into the relative safety of the mostly Jewish neighborhood but had easy 
access to the mosques and schools in the mostly Arab neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the number in Jaffa rose to an estimated 80 families in the past year, 
the security services discovered that they had badly miscalculated the 
collaborators' ability to adapt to their new surroundings. Most were uneducated 
people from West Bank villages. They have little in common with the urban 
Palestinians of Jaffa and soon found themselves treated as social and political 
pariahs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very easy to know them, because here in Jaffa, the Palestinians are 
like a big family," said Kosai Kabaha, headmaster of Achava Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Achava, one of two Jaffa elementary schools for Palestinians, has 29 children 
of collaborators attending classes, Kabaha said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of those families are not intellectuals," Kabaha said. "They 
were on the margins of society. They have hard psychological and social 
problems. They do not speak Hebrew." (Hebrew is a required language in all 
Israeli schools, whether Jewish or Arab, but in the West Bank, it was never 
taught as part of the regular curriculum.) 
</P>
<P>
 In August, outrage inspired Jaffa's first joint Jewish-Arab rally -- demanding 
that no more collaborators be resettled in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sending the collaborators here is solving one problem by creating another," 
said Mikhail Roe'e, a Tel Aviv city councilman who lives in Jaffa and holds the 
cultural and economic portfolio for the community on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe'e says that Jaffa, long a neglected enclave, is poised to take off 
economically and socially. Both Jews and Arabs see collaborators as threatening 
the neighborhood's chance to better itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Shin Bet is building a time bomb inside Jaffa. If they move hundreds more 
collaborators here, there will be riots in the streets," Roe'e predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trickle of collaborators into pre-1967 Israel threatens to grow to a 
flood once the PLO extends its authority throughout the West Bank, at least one 
Israeli human rights group warns. 
</P>
<P>
 B'tzelem, which monitors the territories, estimates that "the number of 
collaborators and their families in the territories totals between 30,000 and 
50,000 people," according to a report on collaborators it issued in January. 
Security sources say the figure is much lower -- possibly several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the number, the Shin Bet is under pressure from Israeli communities 
to come up with a solution other than resettlement in Israeli towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does the Shin Bet insist on moving these people to disadvantaged 
neighborhoods?" asked Avi Steinmetz, deputy director general of the Tel 
Aviv-Jaffa municipality. "Why aren't collaborators taken to Ramat Aviv, or the 
kibbutzim ?" Steinmetz asked, referring to a wealthy community in the coastal 
plain and the nation's collective farming system. 
</P>
<P>
 Tel Aviv-Jaffa Mayor Ronni Milo appointed Steinmetz to negotiate with the Shin 
Bet about collaborators after one relocated man killed a Jewish resident of 
Shapira, a poor neighborhood of south Tel Aviv. The collaborator told 
authorities he killed his neighbor in the hopes the act would rehabilitate him 
in the eyes of fellow villagers. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinmetz and other municipal officials are urging the Shin Bet to stop 
sending collaborators to their communities and to build them a village of their 
own, inside the pre-1967 borders. "That would give them opportunities and 
structures to support them," Steinmetz argued. "These people helped the state 
of Israel. They deserve something." 
</P>
<P>
 "That idea is being studied," said Oded Ben-Ami, Rabin's spokesman on security 
issues. "But the Shin Bet does not want to stigmatize these people by putting 
them all in one village that everyone would know as the collaborator village. 
The hope is that, eventually, the children of these people will be 
rehabilitated and lead normal lives." 
</P>
<P>
 That goal seems remote now as Israel struggles to clean up some of the human 
mess its 27-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The government continues to hope that the Palestinian Authority will ease its 
dilemma by granting a general pardon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government sees it as a litmus test of sorts," one senior security source 
said. "If the Palestinian Authority really can pardon these people, it means 
that we've put the past behind us and are ready to look to the future. If they 
insist on hounding people for what they did 20 years ago or 10 years ago, it 
means that they have not made the switch from a mood of fighting Israel to a 
mood of making real peace."

ISRAEL JOINS MIDEAST TALKS ON ECONOMY; COMMERCE: OFFICIALS, BUSINESS LEADERS 
FROM 60 NATIONS SEEK TO CONVERT PEACE INTO PROSPERITY. CHRISTOPHER OFFERS U.S. 
PLAN FOR REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Israel and its Arab neighbors steadily chipping away at half a century of 
war and hatred, government officials and business leaders from more than 60 
nations gathered Sunday at Morocco's royal palace to search for ways to convert 
peace into greater prosperity for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason why the economic miracles that are transforming parts of 
Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America cannot also transform this region," U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the opening session of the Middle 
East and North Africa Economic Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can foresee a day when the 300 million people of the Middle East and North 
Africa, so long held back by strife and hatred, can finally join the mainstream 
of international commerce," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, seated next to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser 
Arafat, outlined a four-point U.S. plan to stimulate investment, trade and 
tourism in a region where war and hostility have often built impenetrable 
economic barriers between the closest of neighbors, costing billions of dollars 
a year in lost production. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not include it in the four-point plan, Christopher also called 
for an end to the Arab economic boycott of Israel. He said the boycott has 
virtually collapsed and no longer has much economic impact but said, "We want 
to have a formal recognition that the boycott has come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the conference probably will urge the Arab League to 
repeal the boycott. With most league members represented in Casablanca, such an 
appeal would probably carry substantial weight. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, attended by 10 heads of state or government, 60 Cabinet 
ministers, more than 400 other government officials and -- probably most 
important -- more than 1,000 business people, amounts to a coming-out party for 
Israel, which only a few years ago was not welcome at large Arab-dominated 
regional meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in an often-emotional review of Israel's 
struggle for peace and sovereignty, said the conference, attended by virtually 
all Arab governments, provides an "opportunity to talk to one another, to know 
one another." 
</P>
<P>
 He said peace must be "translated into a better life for every citizen," 
adding, "Poverty is the fertile ground for the growth of Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad," two radical Islamic terrorist organizations and sworn enemies of 
Arab-Israeli rapprochement. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the meeting reflects "the growing acceptance of Israel in the 
Middle East" almost 50 years after the Jewish state was born in a bloody 
struggle against the surrounding Arab countries that wanted to expel it from 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told reporters: "This conference opens a 
new chapter in the outlook and in the destiny of the Middle East. Until now, we 
were basically solving problems of the past and putting an end of the conflicts 
of yesterday. We are trying now to build a new economic structure in the Middle 
East so people will feel the benefits and taste the fruits of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Christopher described the steps that Washington believes will 
rebuild the regional economy and produce greater growth than the Middle East 
has enjoyed this century: 
</P>
<P>
 * Elimination of most existing tariffs and other trade barriers to permit "the 
free movement of goods, capital, ideas and labor across the borders of the 
Middle East and North Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of a Middle East and North Africa Bank to finance projects across 
the region. U.S. officials said the bank's capital would come from the United 
States, Japan, the European Union and others, including Mideast countries that 
hope to obtain loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishment of a regional tourism board to promote visits across the 
region, such as package tours for Americans, Europeans and others that would 
combine attractions such as the religious shrines in Jerusalem with the 
archeological sites in Arab countries like Jordan and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Development of a regional business council to integrate trade relations and 
commercial opportunities throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conference approves the program as expected, U.S. officials said 
Washington will contribute some of the money but that most of it will have to 
come from other governments and the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to reporters on the flight from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to Casablanca, 
Christopher said the peace process will succeed only if it produces "the 
economic benefits which will show the people that peace is not just a sterile 
concept but that it portends positive things in their lives." He said only 
private investment can produce the kind of economic clout that the region 
needs. But he said business people cannot be expected to invest until the 
region overcomes the war and instability that have marked it for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres agreed that private money is the key. "Governments have policies but no 
money; companies have money but no political goals," he said. "At this 
conference, we want to bring the two together so that the companies invest in 
the projects that interest them, that appear to them to be profitable, and the 
governments provide the policy direction and the guarantees the businesses need 
to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say much of the money must be generated within the region, with 
rich countries such as Saudi Arabia and the other monarchies along the Persian 
Gulf contributing much of the capital. But Arab states also fill out the lower 
end of the economic scale. Israel, once among the region's poor, has 
established itself in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said Israel is prepared to help some of its poorer neighbors. "We do not 
think that Israel should remain an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty," 
he said. "We think that the better off our neighbors are, the better off we 
will be. Poverty, want and desperation contribute a lot to the tensions, the 
conflict and the terrorism in the region." 
</P>
<P>
 On a related subject, Christopher dismissed as "public posturing" the 
complaints of some Israeli officials that President Clinton obtained almost 
nothing new in his Damascus meeting last week with Syrian President Hafez 
Assad. At the time, U.S. officials said the Clinton-Assad talks produced small 
but significant advances in the painfully slow Syria-Israel peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very intense negotiation with very difficult issues, and both 
parties are conducting themselves in public in a way to maximize their 
negotiating position," he said. "I don't find it surprising that either party 
would tend to downplay any concessions they might have received. . . . That's 
just part of this very, very tough negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres seemed to agree. He said Clinton's trip was worthwhile because as long 
as "Syria remains in the orbit of negotiations, then Syria should be in the 
orbit of visits." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, nearly two years in the planning, is sponsored by the World 
Economic Forum of Geneva and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York under 
the patronage of King Hassan II of Morocco.

REBUILDING HOPE, NOT JUST HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackie Allen tries hard to focus on the future, imagining a time, perhaps late 
next year, when she will be home. 
</P>
<P>
 She will entertain guests again, something she has not felt able to do since 
the flames consumed her home and eight others on Buena Vista Way. She will stop 
feeling jumpy at the slightest provocation. And she will look out her window at 
the return of her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This next year, everything's going to be moving," Allen said, a note of 
determination creeping into her voice. "We're all going to feel better when we 
see the houses go up. That's what we all need." 
</P>
<P>
 One year after the Laguna firestorm raced down this narrow, hillside street, 
incinerating homes and disrupting lives, Buena Vista Way looks much as it did 
in the days just after the blaze was extinguished: a devastated landscape of 
barren slabs and twisted trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the trauma is equally clear along the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Patterson speaks of a vulnerability and fear she never had before. 
Allen's eyes fill as she says she has tried without success to make her 
pleasant, but temporary, dwelling in South Laguna feel like a home. 
</P>
<P>
 And George Cary and Tom Homan say they are still unsettled, unable to regain 
the comfortable stability of life before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In other fire-ravaged Laguna neighborhoods, rebuilding is underway, with more 
than 70 homes going up throughout the city, and four already completed. But 
progress on Buena Vista has been agonizingly slow, marred by geological 
worries, insurance problems and bitter disputes among former neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, by last week's anniversary, not one of the street's fire victims had 
received a permit to rebuild, though several were nearing that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just been at a standstill," said Allen, who hopes that she and her 
husband, Jim, will break ground for their new home on Buena Vista Way by the 
end of November. "I feel like we've all been on this constant hold ever since 
the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 In another blow to the neighborhood's recovery, nearly half the street's fire 
victims have chosen not to return and another is wavering. With land values 
relatively low, those moving away also said they have no immediate plans to 
sell, raising the possibility that their lots might lie empty for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the frustrations, the pace of recovery -- and the mood -- on Buena 
Vista is picking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural plans for three new homes -- the Allens' at the north end of the 
street, the Pattersons' across the way, and Homan's next door -- have emerged 
from Laguna's design review process. If all goes well, the three should receive 
building permits by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I've got something tangible to focus on now," Patterson said of 
her plans for a two-story dwelling. "There's something I can point to, some 
evidence that I'm getting closer to moving back home." 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since the fire, the nine families and individuals who lost their 
homes here have managed to remain surprisingly upbeat. Some said they have 
gained strength or insight from the experience; others use humor to cope with 
the anguish and frustrations it left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my house I miss, but the things in it," Jackie Allen said, tears 
staining her face. "It's your memories, things from your mother, your 
grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that long list of things that Jackie wrote out for me to do," Jim Allen 
said facetiously. "I miss that a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 There are scattered signs of rebirth. Bright-green shoots have pushed up 
around the bases of many blackened trees and, here and there, architects' 
placards and spindly wooden stakes hold promise that life will return to the 
burned-out end of this street. 
</P>
<P>
 The new homes will reflect an increased awareness of fire safety. Gone are the 
wooden decks and siding, the shake and shingle roofs. In their place will be 
concrete patios, stucco walls and tile or concrete roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 But making their houses more resistant to the flames is not the only lesson 
these fire survivors have learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Allen, 64, said he takes more time to appreciate life each day. "I can't 
really explain it, but a lot of those things I was rushing to don't seem that 
important anymore," said Allen, a former contractor who works in the county's 
public works department. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Ireland, 75, said that although her home survived, she takes pleasure in 
nature in a way she never did. "I would not have expressed myself in this 
manner before, but it was a thrill to see the tiny green shoots" coming up 
recently on a neighbor's burned-out lot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Williamson, 80, and his wife, Jo, 78, lost their home of 37 years, along 
with a lifetime of belongings. Among the items they miss most are the hundreds 
of art books collected during Don's tenure as director of Laguna's Pageant of 
the Masters, and the costumes and mementos from the days they both spent as 
amateur actors at the Laguna Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fire's wake, Don Williamson said, he and his wife understand even more 
fully how much they cherish their relationships with friends, family and 
especially son Doug, daughter Jennie and son-in-law Geoff Riker. 
</P>
<P>
 The year since the fire has included measures of joy and aggravation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joys are that nobody was hurt, and we lost everything but we're getting 
it back," said Williamson, whose family is among those now leaving the street. 
"Some of it is really kind of exciting. You can't change location and every 
possession without thinking in terms of beginning a different kind of a life." 
</P>
<P>
 The old life, for the Williamsons and others on this peaceful, winding street 
overlooking the Pacific, was quiet and secluded. Few residents knew their 
neighbors well. One, college professor Christian Werner, knew none of them at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Ireland, who often walked her two tiny dogs to the street's 
dead-end and chatted with those along her route, and Patterson, 40, an attorney 
who frequently jogged through the area, most of the rest lived in pleasant 
isolation from one another. That is, until the October afternoon when a 
wildfire roared into their Temple Hills neighborhood, the last section of 
Laguna to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several days, the street's residents returned to find their 
homes and possessions gone. Many greeted each other for the first time, 
exchanging names along with condolences. 
</P>
<P>
 The barriers continued to fall as they shared information and frustrations 
about insurance and architects, foundations and geology. Several spoke of 
budding friendships and of a new spirit of community that might develop as they 
all rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But several events have intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Between January and April, resident after resident decided not to return. The 
reasons varied from a reluctance to go through the trials of rebuilding to 
concerns about reports that geologists had found evidence of potential 
instability beneath some lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that so many were leaving hit hard for the few who remained. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just start to feel like you know your neighbors a little better and then 
half of them move away," said Jackie Allen, who has lived on the street for 19 
years. "You get closer to them because of the fire, but then they're all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Becker, 34, a businessman who had rented out his Buena Vista Way 
property, was the first to decide against rebuilding. In 1991, he said, he had 
spent $300,000 remodeling the three-story stucco house he owned next to the 
Allens and was not interested in another construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker put his lot on the market in January but the listing has since expired. 
He plans to wait for the market to improve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next were the Williamsons, who had lived in a distinctive A-frame house that 
Don, an architect, had designed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by fears of an ancient landslide in their neighborhood that later was 
found to be smaller and less serious than feared, the Williamsons purchased a 
lot on Morningside Drive in Laguna's Bluebird Canyon. They expect to begin 
construction on their new home before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still love Buena Vista and we'll hang on to that (lot) for a while, but 
we're really just as happy with Morningside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Cary and Marlene Wright, who had lived in a multilevel house between 
Becker's and Werner's properties, reached a settlement with their insurer in 
March. Prompted by geological issues and a longtime desire to find a larger, 
flatter lot for their children, they bought land on a hilltop overlooking Buena 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rebuilding plans finally emerged two weeks ago from the design review 
process after they made changes in response to neighbors' protests that the 
house would block their ocean views. But one neighbor remains unhappy and has 
appealed to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay has "cost a lot emotionally," said Cary, 43, an attorney in Newport 
Beach. "That's really the most difficult thing: the frustration of not being 
able to get back to where we were, with a stable home, a place to raise our 
kids and have some peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel like we're living out of a suitcase." 
</P>
<P>
 James Kelly and Robert Mangel, whose Spanish-style dwelling had stood beside 
the Williamsons', also opted to leave Buena Vista last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, 45, the director of the department of social work at Cal State Long 
Beach, and Mangel, 44, an emergency room physician, bought an oceanfront house 
in Laguna's Woods Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reasons included fears that an already rocky relationship with one 
neighbor might worsen during the rebuilding process, Kelly said, but mainly, 
they just needed to move forward after months on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another property owner is undecided about rebuilding. Loretta Edger, who 
had rented her Buena Vista house to a tenant but often visited from her home in 
Illinois, said she worries about the time commitment involved in construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a part of me that has already designed the (new) house," said Edger, 
a former teacher and real estate agent. "I can see it in my mind. But there's 
another part that doesn't want to be there all the time, and I'm not the kind 
of person who could rebuild from afar. I still don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 However, even those committed to rebuilding have not had an easy time. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner, 59, the acting dean of social sciences at UC Irvine, has not reached a 
settlement with his insurer, the California Casualty Group, and accused the 
company last week of "nickel-and-diming me to death." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest of several conflicts, Werner said, is over how much the insurer 
will pay toward his new foundation, which must be upgraded from the old one to 
meet current codes. The difference between the cost of the old and new 
foundations may amount to more than $50,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Sevey, senior vice president of California Casualty, said the 
complaint is unfair, in part because the question of whether the more expensive 
foundation is necessary has not been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has tried to be responsive to Werner's concerns, Sevey said. In 
March, he said, it agreed to waive the cap on the professor's standard 
homeowner's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a duty to Dr. Werner to make sure he receives the benefit of his 
policy, but also to all of our other policyholders not to be too liberal (in 
settling claims)," Sevey said. "We're trying to balance those duties." 
</P>
<P>
 But with several of his neighbors on the brink of rebuilding, Werner said he 
remains frustrated at the slow progress of his claim and looks forward to the 
day he can rebuild his house and replant his beloved garden of vines, trees and 
shrubs from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, these frustrations do get me down temporarily, but it does not 
last," said Werner, who emigrated from Germany nearly 30 years ago. "I have 
lots of good friends, I get a lot of support from this (university) system." 
</P>
<P>
 For several current and former Buena Vista residents, though, one of the most 
distressing aspects of the fire's aftermath was a bitter conflict between two 
former -- and future -- neighbors over rebuilding plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Patterson and Tom Homan had lived beside each other on the uphill side 
of Buena Vista Way for more than five years. Their houses were the only two on 
that side of the street to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Homan produced his plans for reconstruction, Patterson and several 
residents on the street above objected, leading to multiple design review 
hearings and numerous revisions before the plans were approved. The dispute, 
which centered on whether Homan's new house would block the views of his 
neighbors, at times degenerated to angry name-calling, with both Patterson and 
Homan characterizing the other as greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But each last week expressed relief that a compromise has been reached and 
said they could paper over their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be all right," said Homan, 41, who heads an industrial distribution 
company in Irvine. "I'm sure we both just want the neighborhood to be peaceful 
and friendly again." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson agreed. "We'll put it behind us; how can you not?" she asked. "I'm 
not going to live next to a guy and not live there as neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 They and others hope that they have rounded a corner, that the long, difficult 
year for this tiny street and so many of its residents is finally at an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need to put it all behind us now and try to go on," Jackie Allen 
said. "It doesn't do any of us any good to focus on what a tough year it's 
been. We need to get back on track with our lives." BUENA VISTA WAY CHRONOLOGY

UNCERTAINTY, LAWSUITS WOULD GREET PROP. 187; ELECTION: SOME ORANGE COUNTY 
HEALTH PROVIDERS SAY THEY WOULD ACTIVELY DISOBEY PROVISIONS OF INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 is approved by California voters, most of its get-tough 
provisions eliminating government services to illegal immigrants would be 
scheduled to take effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with little more than a week before Election Day, many hospitals, 
clinics and government entities -- confused by the measure's broad wording or 
concerned about its harsh consequences and hopeful that it will be rejected 
either by state voters or by the courts afterward -- have yet to prepare 
contingency plans for implementing the sweeping initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials say they don't plan to give guidance to local hospitals 
and clinics until after the election, and are not yet sure how they will 
provide such basic services as communicable disease control because of the 
wording of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters further are petitions being circulated among health-care 
professionals pledging their refusal to implement the initiative, which would 
require personnel at most hospitals and clinics to refuse non-emergency 
treatment to illegal immigrants and to report the names of suspected illegal 
immigrants to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overlay of civil disobedience, general confusion, lawsuits and 
uncertainty about how to apply the law will result in great chaos," predicted 
David Langness, a vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Orange County health-care providers who oppose Proposition 187 already 
have decided that they will actively resist implementing the measure, even if 
it means going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I and others are planning to resist," said Dr. Howard Waitzkin, a professor 
of internal medicine at UC Irvine who sees patients at the North Orange County 
Community Clinic in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an absolutely outrageous addition to the already inadequate 
public services available in California. It poses a threat to the public 
health. It tells us that people who have disease can't be taken care of . . . 
and in the final instance, it's inhumane," Waitzkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, one of the few certainties is that if Proposition 187 is 
approved Nov. 8, a flurry of lawsuits will be filed in federal and state courts 
across California beginning Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "The celebration election night will be very short," acknowledged Ron S. 
Prince, co-chair of the pro-187 campaign committee, "because we'll have to be 
in court the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the California Medical Assn., the California Assn. of Hospitals, 
the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the National 
Immigration Law Center, among other groups, are currently ensconced at their 
computer terminals, preparing lawsuits to thwart the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to talk about a lawyer's employment program, this is it," said 
one such attorney, Peter D. Roos of the Bay Area-based Multi Cultural Education 
Training and Advocacy Inc. "The O.J. case is a whodunit -- it's simple compared 
to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-187 lawyers say the issues to be covered will range from the 
constitutionality of Proposition 187's key educational provisions to whether 
California voters even have the right to consider wide-ranging immigration 
questions, since immigration is generally within the purview of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the fact the federal government constitutionally has basically 
been given the responsibility of dealing with immigration -- and this proposal 
defines legal residency status differently than the way the federal government 
does -- there is a clear conflict there," said Lilly Spitz, staff attorney for 
the California Assn. of Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU of Southern California is considering filing a comprehensive suit on 
behalf of several organizations to scuttle the measure's impact on about 15 
health and social services programs. However, ACLU legal director Mark 
Rosenbaum said that at this point, he prefers to focus on Election Day rather 
than the day after. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ballot box is the only 100% certain way to defeat the measure," he said, 
"and litigation, if required, is going to be time consuming, enormously 
divisive and expensive beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, Rosenbaum asserted that the initiative, co-authored by Harold 
Ezell, former INS Western regional commissioner and fast-food executive, is 
chock full of legal flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This measure is like target practice against the Constitution," Rosenbaum 
said. "It was written by a hot dog executive, with the same level of 
sophistication as stuffing a hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Wylie, executive director of the Public Law Center in Santa Ana, said 
his office is so sure the proposition will fail on constitutional grounds that 
they aren't even preparing a legal attack on the measure on behalf of 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, the head of the pro-187 campaign, refuses to discuss legal issues. "We 
can't help you there," he said. "We don't have a lawyer who wouldn't charge to 
consult with you on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative co-author Alan Nelson, an attorney, says he expects the state 
attorney general's office to deal with a barrage of lawsuits, but he is 
confident the measure will hold up. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure "ought not to be so specific as to cover every nitty-gritty 
thing," he said. "It sets forth the general principles and we'd have the state 
follow up with regulations and implementing procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballot measures often spawn long and costly lawsuits -- the insurance reform 
measure, Proposition 103, is a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 187 is different in one key regard: Its sponsors are actually 
inviting litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1982 case of Plyler vs. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 
unconstitutional a Texas law eliminating a free public school education for 
illegal immigrant children. By asking California voters to banish illegal 
immigrants from schools, Proposition 187 sponsors are essentially asking the 
electorate to authorize a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to request the court to take 
another look at the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the initiative is to have the court revisit and reconsider the 
Plyler decision," Nelson said. "Passage of the initiative will provide that 
vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those planning challenges of the measure's schooling ban if it passes 
are attorney Roos, of Multi Cultural Education Training and Advocacy, and Peter 
A. Schey, who heads the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law. Both attorneys appeared before the Supreme Court more than 
a decade ago to successfully argue the Plyler vs. Doe case. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the basic issue has already been adjudicated once, constitutional law 
experts say, the initiative is bound to speedily make its way back to the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it went first to either the state or federal court system, all the lower 
courts would have to declare it unconstitutional because only the Supreme Court 
could overrule Plyler vs. Doe," said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the measure's public school provisions would not take effect until 
Jan. 1, 1995, school suits might not be filed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Schey, for one, said he probably will hold off until state government agencies 
make clear "how they intend to interpret the measure's very ambiguous 
provisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office, as it routinely does, is preparing to 
defend the ballot measure. "You can imagine how quickly legal actions will be 
filed," said spokesman David Puglia. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, meanwhile, say they are fielding calls from parents worried 
about the repercussions of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's rumors, confusion and a lack of understanding of how initiatives 
work," said Los Angeles Board of Education President Mark Slavkin. "We're 
trying to get out the message that children should keep coming to school. . . . 
If there is to be a change in our practices and procedures, we'll let people 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the schooling ban were declared unconstitutional, other portions of 
the measure could still take effect due to a severability clause in the 
initiative. Since these portions, covering health care, social services and law 
enforcement, do not include implementation dates, they are scheduled to go into 
effect immediately upon passage, according to the secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any initiative, if regulations are needed to clarify it or have to be 
promulgated to implement it, they will," said Leslie Goodman, director of 
communications for Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first expected to file lawsuits is the Los Angeles-based National 
Immigration Law Center, which plans to seek an immediate federal court ruling 
on behalf of immigrants who claim they are entitled to full Medi-Cal benefits 
but do not have documents readily available to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Center attorney Charles Wheeler said the suit would be designed to enforce a 
1991 federal ruling ordering state officials to provide full benefits while 
giving immigrants "a reasonable opportunity" to obtain necessary documents. The 
injunction also covers undocumented immigrants the INS is aware of but is not 
considering deporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential lawsuits would attack the entire initiative on constitutional 
or statutory grounds. For example, the requirement for reporting people 
reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants to federal authorities raises 
discrimination issues, said Spitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "By attempting to treat people differently because of their accent, dress and 
their ethnicity, the law on its face would be unconstitutional," she contended. 
</P>
<P>
 With the measure continuing to receive slightly more than 50% support in 
pre-election polls, officials of health-care facilities and government agencies 
that would be directly impacted say they have little direction on how to 
proceed if the measure wins. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, says Langness, Southern California hospitals and health clinics 
also have not yet formulated plans to implement Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the measure will be defeated, and if it passes, we anticipate court 
action that will last a long time," he said, "We have also heard from many 
clinics and several hospitals that petitions are circulating among doctors and 
nurses . . . saying they will refuse to implement 187 if it passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson responded that "promoting anarchy is a big P.R. gimmick. You have to 
believe most people will adhere to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Inglish, executive director of the Coalition of Orange County Community 
Clinics, said he assumes that if the initiative passes, an injunction will be 
filed in court barring its immediate implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the individual boards of the county's 14 health clinics will have 
to determine whether they will abide by the measure's provisions or risk losing 
state funding for their programs, Inglish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglish said his main concern is not what the clinics will do right away, but 
what illegal immigrants perceive they will do. 
</P>
<P>
 If the perception is that patients will be turned in to the INS, Inglish said, 
many of the fears health officials have about the initiative could be realized 
immediately: People who need care will not seek it, endangering their own 
health and the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no estimates available on how many of 72,000 people seen in the 
clinics annually are illegal immigrants. The clinics provide services such as 
immunizations, prenatal care and programs to fight sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglish said that if the initiative is blocked in court, a publicity campaign 
may be needed to let undocumented residents know it is still safe to visit the 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the state Department of Health Services, seeking to meet the 
wishes of the Wilson Administration, has been working on directives to be 
issued to hospitals and clinics shortly after Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the state to advise hospitals to continue treating anyone who 
bears a full-scale Medi-Cal card, said Deputy Director Elisabeth C. Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means they're not undocumented aliens and already have been found by our 
department to have an appropriate immigrant status," said Brandt, the agency's 
chief counsel. "We want to be sure providers don't discriminate against anyone 
based on suspected alien status when we've already gone through that. That 
would be a real problem with federal laws and jeopardize federal medical 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Such advice, however, appears at odds with the aims of initiative sponsors, 
who have argued illegal immigrants now receive government funds for which they 
are ineligible because of the ease of obtaining fraudulent documents. Moreover, 
Gov. Pete Wilson, one of the leading proponents of Proposition 187, has called 
for the issuance of new tamper-proof ID cards to provide proof of legal 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt said the state government is also considering becoming directly 
involved in administering immunizations because the measure forbids publicly 
funded hospitals and clinics from serving illegal immigrants. Such action would 
come in large part, Brandt said, because Wilson has indicated to the agency 
that he doesn't want to place the larger population at risk of contagious 
disease if Proposition 187 wins approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initiative doesn't say the government can't pay for the service," 
asserted Brandt . "It says the (hospital or clinic) facility may not provide 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such thinking, however, appears to fly in the face of the measure's intent. 
Its authors have made clear time and again their main goal is to prevent 
government funds from being spent on illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as giving free medical aid to every other person here illegally, you 
have to say no," Ezell said recently. "If it's immunizations, let some of the 
private groups pay for some of this stuff. Let MALDEF (the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund) open a clinic for it. Let the Ford 
Foundation pay for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Meissner, INS commissioner, is cautious about discussing how her agency 
would go about enforcing Proposition 187 if it becomes law. Under the measure, 
hospitals, schools and some others government entities are directed to report 
people suspected of being illegal immigrants to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time we have not made any special preparations," she said recently, 
though she acknowledged the measure would strain the immigration service. 
</P>
<P>
 Many opponents of Proposition 187 have been so busy in the last days of the 
campaign trying to defeat the initiative that they haven't had much time to 
figure out what they will do if it actually passes, said Chauncey Alexander, 
founder of United Way of Orange County's Health Care Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no plan for it being passed," the Huntington Beach resident said. 
"We're all working against it."

WHITE HOUSE SUSPECT LEFT NOTE; SHOOTING: MESSAGE INDICATES HE EXPECTED TO DIE, 
A SOURCE SAYS. THE 26-YEAR-OLD COLORADO HOTEL WORKER, A DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED 
SOLDIER, IS FORMALLY CHARGED. 
</P>

<P>
 Francisco Martin Duran, the Colorado man accused of spraying the outside of 
the White House with rifle fire, was formally charged Sunday with possessing a 
firearm as a convicted felon and damaging federal property. One federal source 
said Duran left "a semi-suicide note" in his belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the source, Duran -- an Army veteran who served 2 1/2 years in 
the Ft. Leavenworth, Kan., penitentiary for aggravated assault with a vehicle 
-- apparently expected to die after firing 20 to 30 rounds at the White House 
on Saturday. The rambling, handwritten note detailed how he wanted his affairs 
handled in the event of his death, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran instead was subdued by two tourists and taken into custody by Secret 
Service officers. Although several shots from his Chinese-made assault rifle 
struck the building, no one was injured in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran's note eventually may shed light on a possible motive for the attack, 
but officials said Sunday they were still not certain what motivated him to 
fire the shots from a public sidewalk in front of the White House. The Secret 
Service, describing his demeanor as "completely flat," said the 26-year-old 
hotel worker was not cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said: "At this point in time, there 
really is no indication as to what his motive was." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran is scheduled to be arraigned in federal court today. The firearms 
charge, upon conviction, is punishable by a maximum 10 years in prison and 
fines of $250,000. The property charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years 
and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials said there is no evidence at present of any attempt to 
assassinate the President, who was in the White House Executive Mansion at the 
time, Ronald Noble, the Treasury Department's enforcement chief, told reporters 
Sunday that such a charge has not been ruled out. He said a criminal 
investigation is continuing with help from agencies including the Secret 
Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI, the U.S. Park 
Police and the District of Columbia Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army reported that Duran was dishonorably discharged in September, 1993, 
after serving 30 months in military prison on charges of vehicular aggravated 
assault, drunk and disorderly conduct, drunk driving and leaving the scene of 
an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently had been working as an upholsterer at the posh Broadmoor Hotel in 
Colorado Springs, Colo., but abruptly disappeared a month ago after saying he 
needed to buy supplies for target practice, according to a missing-person 
report filed by his wife in El Paso County, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denver, hotel President Steve Bartolin told reporters that Duran, who lived 
in the nearby community of Widefield with his wife and 5-year-old son, was a 
loner who showed up for work on time every day, up to the day he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody had anything to say (about him), he was so quiet," Bartolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Sunday that Duran purchased the SKS assault rifle used in the 
attack in Colorado Springs on Sept. 13, the same day Clinton signed into law 
the massive anti-crime bill, which prohibits future purchases of most 
semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Duran's weapon had been imported by a dealer in January, before Clinton 
banned that particular Chinese-made weapon in May, so there was nothing illegal 
about Duran's purchase of the weapon, according to the officials at the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials stressed that Clinton continues to have "great 
confidence" in the protection afforded him by the Secret Service. The President 
rested Sunday and held to his plan to attend an evening gala at Ford's Theatre, 
where President Abraham Lincoln was killed by an assassin's bullet 129 years 
ago. The shooting was not mentioned by any of the performers, who included 
Whoopi Goldberg, Paula Poundstone, Luther Vandross, Sam Waterston, Paul Reiser 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the two bystanders who tackled Duran recounted how they ended his 
shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Rakosky, 34, of San Antonio, told the Associated Press that he saw the 
man fumbling with the weapon to put in another magazine. "I thought that would 
be a good time to take him out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Lord had me at the right place at the right time," he added. "I'm 
real thankful to him that nobody got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The other man, Ken Davis of Hagerstown, Md., said: "Harry hit him high, in the 
back. I grabbed his legs as he went down. He kicked a tiny bit and stopped. The 
barrel was against his side, pointed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Haines of Washington, D.C. then held the rifle down so the gunman could 
not move it. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said the principal problem illustrated by Saturday's 
incident is the number of heavy weapons on U.S. streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think generally the number of weapons on the streets of this country is 
disconcerting to the President, and that's why he fought so hard to pass a 
crime bill that included a ban on assault weapons," Press Secretary Dee Dee 
Myers told reporters Sunday at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, interviewed on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation," said there were 
no immediate plans to close off a two-block section of Pennsylvania Avenue that 
runs in front of the White House, as the Secret Service has suggested from time 
to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said a range of new security steps will be considered early next year 
when a Treasury Department study has been completed. That review began six 
weeks ago after a Maryland man, in an apparent suicide, crashed a single-engine 
aircraft on the South Lawn, only a few feet from the Executive Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said guaranteeing total security of a President is 
all but impossible, given any chief executive's desire to mingle with the 
public and to allow citizens access to the White House for events and tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the Secret Service, one high-ranking official said: "They'd like 
to take bulletproof material and lock the whole building inside it. But you 
just can't do that in a free society."

TROOPS IN HAITI FEEL FORGOTTEN BACK HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As word finally reached Camp Dragon of President Clinton's visit to U.S. 
forces in Kuwait last week, a wave of resentment swept Sunday through the 
former swamp and garbage dump that houses many of the 16,000 U.S. troops still 
in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of a military mission that senior U.S. officials 
confirmed may last longer than the Clinton Administration had hoped and 
promised, the news could not have come at a worse time for combat troops in 
Haiti, whose morale already appeared to be plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the reaction was Pfc. Dan DeCristo, who sat shirtless, sweating and 
scribbling a script for a comedy skit Sunday morning while some of his 
colleagues in the 22nd Infantry Regiment of the Army's 10th Mountain Division 
played in a volleyball tournament nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish people back home would realize we're still down here. And here 
the President goes and tells those guys in Kuwait to go do their Christmas 
shopping?" DeCristo, a Rhode Island native, said with angry incredulity. "Look, 
I'm a big supporter of President Clinton. I'm always getting ripped for it from 
the guys. But I heard he said that, and I thought, geez! 
</P>
<P>
 "Here he can go halfway around the world for a big peace signing, but he can't 
go 90 miles off the coast of Miami to say, 'Thanks'? To me, it looked like 
we've been forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked that way to Chaplain Dewane Stone too. The veteran Army chaplain of 
the 52nd Engineering Combat Battalion from Ft. Carson, Colo., has borne the 
brunt of the troops' resentment. Dozens of soldiers, he said, came to him to 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'But chaplain,' they all said, 'we came here first, and the President goes 
and visits them and not us. How come he's going to let them go home first when 
we've been here longer?' 
</P>
<P>
 "That swept through the camp," Stone said. "The feeling is unanimous. These 
are the forgotten soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 And most of them will not be home by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The sagging morale among a highly successful intervention force that Clinton 
has praised from afar and cast as a personal foreign policy victory was 
occurring as senior U.S. officials confirmed Sunday that Haiti's plodding 
political process is likely to delay the U.S. withdrawal here. The intervention 
force, they said, is now likely to remain in Haiti beyond the Clinton 
Administration's worst-case target date of March. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy dilemma facing the Clinton Administration, the officials said, is 
grounded in what are now two conflicting promises. The Administration has vowed 
to withdraw from the mission by early next year and yet has promised to keep 
combat soldiers like those in the 10th Mountain Division in Haiti until after 
crucial parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian political leaders and U.S. analysts said that delays in Haiti's 
Parliament, driven in part by a popular desire to keep the U.S. forces here as 
long as possible, already have pushed elections scheduled for December into 
January or February at the earliest -- and perhaps as late as March. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problem is the slow pace of the United Nations, which must 
build a peacekeeping force and assume command of the mission to stabilize and 
restore Haitian democracy after the U.S. combat troops withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a lot of conflicting interests here," one senior U.S. official 
said. "We want to get out as fast as possible. The U.N. wants us to stay as 
long as possible. And the Haitian people want us to stay 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you've got the Parliament dragging its feet, the U.N. totally unprepared 
and the risk of U.S. casualties increasing by the day," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, thousands of increasingly bored U.S. soldiers 
throughout the Haitian capital are convinced that their mission is over. Some 
are like Army Spec. Nigel Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go home on Sept. 19, when we got here and they changed all the 
mission orders," said Allen, a veteran of the U.S. military intervention in 
Somalia, who stressed that his biggest fear is that the longer the U.S. 
contingent stays in Haiti, the greater are the chances for American casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at what happened in Somalia. We were the forgotten soldiers there too. 
For months, no one even knew we were there. Then 18 Americans died, and it got 
back in the news. Something had to happen before people realized we were there. 
I hate to think that has to happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 But most expressed the sentiment of Lt. Chris Leighow, commander of the 22nd 
Regiment's Battle Company, which includes DeCristo and Allen. For him, the 
biggest morale problem is that most of his troops believe that the need for 
America's combat role in Haiti ended after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
returned and the nation remained largely peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't understand why, if Aristide is here and things are going smoothly, 
they're still here. They feel they should be back with the wives and kids," 
Leighow said. "But the biggest problem now is what they're asking us to do is 
not what we've been trained to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the lieutenant cited orders that his troops spend endless hours 
on guard duty outside a villa owned by Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the now-exiled 
former Haitian army commander whose forces the 10th Mountain Division 
originally was supposed to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the morale goes lower when they don't see the point in guarding 
something like that," he said, adding that the infantry's task for this week is 
likely to be traffic patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite end of Camp Dragon, Capt. Jeremy Blanchard warned of worse 
morale problems to come. He is the doctor for the 52nd Engineering Combat 
Battalion that is turning the camp into a fully equipped tent city for 6,000. 
Although the battalion was as miffed at Clinton's Mideast tour as the combat 
troops of the 22nd Regiment, most of the engineers and truckers were heartened 
by news over the weekend that they may go home as early as mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 With heightened expectations, though, Blanchard said the worst may yet be 
ahead in a mission that already has seen three suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's definitely going to be hard if they're still here for Christmas," said 
Blanchard, who performs psychological examinations every week on the men and 
women of the 52nd. "I feel that people are going to get really upset and decide 
they've got to get home. . . . That's when people start looking for marijuana 
to fail a urine test. It's definitely a minority now, but if that happens, I'm 
not sure it will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaplain Stone's conclusion: "Most of them are hoping real hard they'll be 
home for Christmas. If they're not, morale is going to hit the floor again, and 
I'm going to be real busy."

NEWS ANALYSIS; FOCUS ON FOES' INEXPERIENCE AIDS DEMOCRATS

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a few weeks ago, Republican George W. Bush appeared poised to take 
command of the Texas governor's race with a blistering attack against incumbent 
Ann Richards' record on crime, welfare, education and state spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, it is Bush, a 48-year-old businessman who has never held public 
office, who finds himself dodging flak. In biting TV ads and a grueling 
schedule of appearances, Richards appears to have regained the initiative with 
a lacerating counterattack that portrays the former President's son as 
unqualified, unethical and a failure in business who has floated through life 
on his father's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here is a Johnny-come-lately who has spent his whole life 
eating off a silver platter, and we are not going to let him lead our state," 
said Richards, an extravagantly silver-haired 61, at an enthusiastic rally here 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closely watched Massachusetts Senate race, there's been a similar 
reversal of roles. After months on the defensive, Democratic Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy has used a volley of harsh negative advertisements to reopen a gaping 
lead over Mitt Romney, another first-time candidate whose youth and slim good 
looks seem to almost mock Kennedy's mottled and bloated visage. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise in Florida, 64-year-old Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles -- who two 
weeks ago looked like a retirement waiting to happen -- has fought back to at 
least a dead heat with an uncharacteristically personal counterattack against 
Jeb Bush, more than two decades Chiles' junior and another son of the former 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 This pivot between hunter and prey is apparent in more than half a dozen 
Senate and gubernatorial races where a Democratic incumbent faces a serious 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling against opponents who are either much younger, or are new to 
politics, veteran Democrats from Richards, Chiles and Kennedy to Govs. Mario M. 
Cuomo of New York and Zell Miller of Georgia and Sens. Dianne Feinstein of 
California and Jim Sasser of Tennessee have fought their way off the mat with 
remarkably similar strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly they are emphasizing their experience and accomplishments; but mostly 
they are ferociously attempting to redefine their opponents as unknown and 
untested quantities with slippery ethics and hidden agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, these Democrats are trying to convert the principal asset of their 
opponents -- their freshness -- into a source of suspicion. "We're taking this 
outsider argument and turning it around," said George Shipley, a consultant to 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment remains premature and probably overly optimistic: Despite 
President Clinton's recent gains in the polls, the anti-Democratic currents 
coursing through parts of the nation may still sweep away several Democrats 
employing these tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past two weeks, Kennedy has regained a substantial lead, and 
Feinstein, Cuomo and Miller have achieved more narrow advantages. Richards, 
Chiles, Sasser and Sen. Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who's in a similar 
position, however, are running no better than even; one public poll released 
Sunday shows Sen. Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania now trailing his much younger 
opponent, Rep. Rick Santorum, although Democrats insist that Wofford is still 
leading. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, virtually across the board, the Democratic counterattacks appear to 
at least have slowed the momentum of their GOP challengers and changed the 
dynamic of these races from a referendum on the incumbent into a choice between 
two inevitably flawed politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving from 'I hate this incumbent' to 'Who is this other guy?' " said 
GOP pollster Bill McInturff. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six Republican challengers to Democratic governors still privately 
rated as the strongest prospects by GOP strategists, all but former Alabama 
Gov. Fob James Jr. are fresh faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Four come directly from the business world: Jeb Bush, a Florida real estate 
developer; George W. Bush, the managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball 
team; Guy Millner, a temporary-services company owner who is challenging Zell 
Miller in Georgia, and Gary E. Johnson, a construction contractor and 
triathlete who is leading veteran Democratic Gov. Bruce King in New Mexico. A 
fifth, George Pataki, was a virtually unknown New York state legislator when 
the campaign began. 
</P>
<P>
 All except Millner are in their 40s and at least 13 years younger than their 
opponents; none except Pataki has ever held public office. 
</P>
<P>
 The same pattern holds true in the Senate. Of the six Democratic senators in 
the toughest races this year, all but New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman are battling 
candidates who contrast sharply in age and/or political experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Romney, the venture capitalist challenging Kennedy; Bill Frist, the 
surgeon running strongly against three-term incumbent Sasser in Tennessee; or 
Oliver L. North, the Iran-Contra figure pressing Robb in Virginia, has ever 
previously sought public office. The two other best-positioned challengers -- 
two-term Pennsylvania Rep. Santorum and one-term Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) -- have been in Congress only long enough for a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 All except North are in their 40s or younger (Santorum is just 36) and at 
least 14 years younger than their Democratic opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these races runs to its own distinct rhythms, but to a striking degree 
they share common lines of battle. The struggle between Richards and George W. 
Bush -- considered too close to call by analysts here -- typifies the 
contrasting closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Wofford (who portrays Santorum as a threat to Social Security) and Sasser 
(who warns that his opponent will cut Medicare), Richards is hammering at 
traditional liberal themes to motivate the party's base voters in these final 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 As she tours the state, Richards aggressively touts her achievements -- 
declining crime rates, rising educational test scores and employment. But the 
heart of her speeches are devoted to diminishing Bush's character and record 
with the same folksy disdain she leveled against his father in her famous "poor 
George" speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about the younger Bush, Richards sounds like David Letterman channeled 
through Minnie Pearl. With hollow-point one-liners that sometimes skirt the 
edge of propriety, she ridicules her opponent as an inexperienced ne'er-do-well 
who joined the race only out of a dynastic sense of entitlement and lacks the 
qualifications to lead the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Democrats facing candidates from the corporate world, she is 
putting the most effort into tarnishing the central rationale of her opponent's 
candidacy: his claim of success in business. She maintains that the five 
companies with which Bush has held decision-making positions -- including the 
two oil businesses he founded -- lost $371 million during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 And like Feinstein (who accuses Huffington of dodging taxes) and Miller (who 
portrays Millner as benefiting from a savings and loan failure), Richards is 
attacking her opponent's business ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, she has suggested impropriety in Bush's 1990 sale of more than 
$800,000 worth of stock in Harken Energy Co., a company of which he sat on the 
board of directors and the audit committee, two months before the firm 
announced a $23-million loss; the stock price then dropped precipitously, 
though it later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush has denounced Richards' broad characterization of his business career and 
her specific allegation of impropriety at Harken Energy. He says he was unaware 
of the impending bad financial news when he sold his stock, and he notes the 
Securities and Exchange Commission declined to pursue any action against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing other Republican newcomers facing comparable attacks, Bush is battling 
to restore the comparisons he wants to stress: outsider versus career 
politician, and conservative against liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bush debated Richards 10 days ago, he unfurled his outsider's banner 
right at the start: "I am not a fine-tuner, and the fact that I haven't held 
political office . . . gives me the freedom to think differently than someone 
who has spent her entire career in public office." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the other track, he is redoubling his efforts to ideologically polarize 
the race by accusing the governor of being soft on crime and allowing the state 
welfare rolls to swell; as if unveiling a smoking gun, his latest television 
ads show Richards delivering a speech for Bill Clinton at the 1992 Democratic 
National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 From here on, Bush's "argument is that she's a liberal, she's a friend of Bill 
Clinton," said Chuck McDonald, Richards' spokesman. "For us, it is pretty clear 
the race is about that he is not who he says he is -- he's not qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 In rough terms, that summarizes the competing messages in the other campaigns 
involving these threatened Democratic incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpected events -- such as Huffington's admission that he employed an 
illegal immigrant and Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 
endorsement of Democrat Cuomo -- could decide some of these races. But in most 
of them, this struggle to control the lens through which voters view their 
choice may prove decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in a battle between a national message and a local message," said 
Democratic media consultant Mandy Grunwald. "Are voters casting a generic vote 
on a 'something's got to change' feeling, or are they going to cast a vote on 
the specific choice in front of them. Are they going to focus on who this 
(challenger) really is? That is the battle."

UNIONS THROW CASH, CLOUT INTO BROWN'S CAMPAIGN; POLITICS: LABOR FEELS SHUT OUT 
BY WILSON AND IS HIS RIVAL'S STAUNCHEST BACKER. BUT PRISON GUARDS SUPPORT 
GOVERNOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "What happens to state workers if Pete Wilson wins the gubernatorial election 
in November?" asks an editorial in the magazine of the largest state workers' 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sunk," is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 With rhetoric like that, it's not surprising that the magazine's publisher, 
the California State Employees Assn., has taken out its checkbook to back 
Wilson's Democratic challenger, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- providing her 
uphill campaign with $264,000 in badly needed cash and services this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A detailed review of Brown's campaign reports and interviews with labor 
leaders show that the state employees group is not alone. Driven by distaste 
for Wilson as much as enthusiasm for Brown, unions across the state, 
representing truck drivers and carpenters, teachers and firefighters, are 
throwing their weight and considerable cash behind efforts to unseat the 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Brown has other major contributors. Director Steven Spielberg has 
chipped in $100,000. And under the cryptic name of 35 East Corporation, 
companies operated by multibillionaire financier Ronald O. Perelman have 
contributed $99,000. (One of Perelman's companies, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings 
Inc., is at 35 E. 62nd St. in New York.) 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Brown has collected $20.7 million through Oct. 22 in her drive to 
become the state's chief executive. While that's not as much as Wilson's 
record-breaking $26.8 million, her campaign aides insist that it is enough to 
keep her competitive through next Tuesday's election. And it is more than 
Wilson's 1990 Democratic opponent, Dianne Feinstein, collected throughout her 
entire campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise the cash needed to compete with Wilson, Brown has turned to a broad 
array of contributors. Her donor lists include big-time personal injury 
attorneys, real estate developers and Hollywood executives. Because there are 
no limits on campaign contributions, a relatively small number of large 
contributors account for much of her campaign war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the steady flow of union cash that has proved to be the lifeblood of 
the Brown campaign. It is support she can count on before anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Oct. 22, the end of the last reporting period, Brown had collected 
almost $3 million from labor. With the two heaviest weeks of campaigning and 
fund raising still to be counted, that total is sure to grow by Election Day. 
But it already exceeds the $2.7 million that Democrat Dianne Feinstein took 
from labor in her unsuccessful race against Wilson in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Using catchy phrases like "Let's beat Pete," and "No Re-Pete," the unions are 
rallying their members to support a candidate that they believe will favor 
their members more than the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days ahead, unions will boost Brown's candidacy by organizing precinct 
walks and phone banks to identify likely Brown voters and by getting them to 
the polls Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Many union leaders say that Brown offers hope for change after the state's 
economically dismal years under Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically for 12 years we've had stagnation," said California Teachers Assn. 
Executive Director Ralph Flynn, referring to Wilson and his GOP predecessor, 
Gov. George Deukmejian. Per-pupil spending in California has been frozen under 
Wilson and in some districts teachers' wages have been cut. But like other 
labor leaders, Flynn says his union's endorsement of Brown goes beyond the 
bread-and-butter issues of wages and benefits for its 235,000 members. Flynn 
said his group is also concerned about rising student fees and Wilson's harsh 
rhetoric on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers have contributed $100,000 to the Brown campaign through Oct. 22. 
Its California State University affiliate, the California Faculty Assn., has 
pumped in an additional $68,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel A. Terry, president of California Professional Firefighters, 
representing 20,000 local, state and federal employees in the state, says his 
members are worried about the ability of communities to respond to fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think generally speaking firefighters are well paid, so we're not moaning 
and groaning about that. . . . But we see the same number of people working 
fire stations today as worked there when we had 17 million people (compared to 
32 million today)." The statewide firefighters organization has contributed 
almost $60,000 to Brown this year and dozens of local units have added from 
$200 to $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one notable exception to the chorus of pro-Brown, anti-Wilson labor 
organizations: the state prison guards' union, the California Correctional 
Peace Officers Assn. The union spent nearly $1 million to help Wilson defeat 
Dianne Feinstein in 1990 and has given $525,000 thus far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has the governor backed tougher sentencing and more prison 
construction, but in difficult financial years, Wilson has been relatively 
generous to the state's prison guards, raising their salaries 2% to 5% more 
than their fellow state workers, said the president of the 23,000-worker union, 
Don Novey. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists that Wilson has done well by state workers in the face of an 
unprecedented fiscal crisis. "This guy inherited a $14-billion hole . . . and 
employees got over 8% to 10% pay increases over this four-year period." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other public employee union leaders who say that the governor won't 
even meet with them, Novey says Wilson has always proved accessible and 
reasonable. "If you sit the guy down, things have a tendency to be worked out," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other labor leaders complain that Novey's union has reaped other rewards for 
its support of Wilson. The governor appointed Novey to one of two labor slots 
on the Industrial Welfare Commission, which sets the minimum wage and grants 
exceptions to the state law requiring overtime pay for work beyond an 
eight-hour day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has placed other prison guard union officials on the Occupational 
Safety and Health Standards Board, which sets worker safety rules, and on a new 
commission that oversees the enforcement of safety rules and implementation of 
workers' compensation reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Novey's union is clearly apart from most labor organizations in this 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Labor is heavily supporting Kathleen Brown," said Michael J. Riley, president 
of Joint Council of Teamsters No. 42 in Los Angeles. "Whatever she is, she's a 
hell of a lot better than Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Henning, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor 
Federation, AFL -- CIO, quickly enumerates half a dozen complaints that 
organized labor has with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items on Henning's list: 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has vetoed bills that extend the period of time covered by 
unemployment benefits and that raise payments to disabled workers. Wilson's 
appointees to the Industrial Welfare Commission have refused to raise the 
state's $4.25-an-hour minimum wage, which was last changed in 1987. After the 
Northridge earthquake, Wilson suspended overtime for those working more than an 
eight-hour day in five Southern California counties. This month, Wilson 
reinstated the overtime pay rule, but said he would ask the Legislature to drop 
the requirement in favor of the federal standard, requiring overtime for work 
in excess of 40 hours in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Henning's list is Wilson's failure to find a replacement for a labor 
union representative on the state's seven-member Occupational Safety and Health 
Standards Board. The vacancy on the board -- probably best known for abolishing 
the crippling shorthanded hoe long used by agricultural workers -- has gone 
unfilled since February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Public employee unions are even more critical, contending that Wilson has 
never made a secret of his anti-labor bias since his decade as mayor of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson is a rogue on labor," said Pat McConahay, spokesperson for the 
130,000-member California State Employees Assn. "The litany of his offenses 
against state employees is a long, ugly laundry list. It's been four years of 
bashing and making us scapegoats of every problem and financial ill of the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 The public employee labor leaders still smart from Wilson's angry response to 
union resistance to the 1991 budget settlement, which included mandatory 
furloughs for state workers and a diversion of $1.9 billion from public 
employee pension funds to balance the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government union bosses," Wilson complained, would rather have layoffs of the 
newest state workers than accept what was, in effect, a 5% pay cut. "In a 
phrase, they are willing to eat their young." 
</P>
<P>
 The unions came back at Wilson with a vengeance the following year, winning 
passage of an initiative intended to prevent future pension fund raids by a 
governor and the Legislature. The unions also helped defeat a Wilson-sponsored 
initiative to cut welfare grants and give the governor the power to slice the 
state budget in a fiscal emergency without legislative approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor support for Democratic candidates for governor has a long tradition. 
According to the AFL -- CIO's Henning, that's been the case since 1952 when 
labor split over its endorsement -- the AFL supporting Republican Gov. Goodwin 
J. Knight, while the CIO backed his Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Brown had to work to win labor endorsements in her primary fight against 
state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and to build on that support for 
the general election: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a Labor Day conversion in 1993, Brown announced her opposition to the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, which was later ratified by Congress 
despite organized labor's protests. Several key union officials say Brown 
reversed her earlier support of NAFTA after she was told that she could not 
expect union support unless she did so. She has said she changed her position 
after she reviewed NAFTA side agreements that did not do enough to protect U.S. 
jobs and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown has repeatedly promised labor unions a say in appointments to key 
positions in her Administration if she is elected. She told the AFL-CIO's 
annual legislative conference in May that as governor she would consult with 
organized labor in naming a new director of industrial relations, the state 
equivalent of the federal secretary of labor. In a front page statement in the 
California AFL-CIO News this month, she argued that Wilson had ignored the 
needs of working men and women, leaving unions on the outside. "That neglect 
will end when I take office next year," she said. "In my Administration, 
organized labor will be back on the inside. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brown campaign committee lists a number of current and former labor 
organizers and officials on its payroll, including Vernon Watkins, who is the 
campaign's political director. Watkins is assistant to the secretary-treasurer 
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees at the 
union's international headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst minimized the significance of union 
support, saying that the issues for unionized workers are the same as for all 
Californians: jobs and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 He recited what has become a mantra of Brown's candidacy: "Working people of 
California believe Kathleen Brown has a plan to create jobs and that Kathleen 
Brown will improve their quality of life. Under Wilson, 550,000 jobs were lost 
and 54,000 businesses failed." 
</P>
<P>
 He contrasted labor participation in the Democrat's campaign to big business 
participation in Republican Wilson's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether Wilson was anti-union, as many labor leaders contend, Dan 
Schnur, the governor's campaign press secretary, said: "Compared to Kathleen 
Brown, he sure is. Would Wilson have caved in to organized labor and come out 
against NAFTA like Kathleen Brown did? Definitely not. Would Pete Wilson oppose 
contracting out of state business to private contractors if the work can be 
done much more quickly and more efficiently, like Kathleen Brown did? 
Definitely not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union bosses might be contributing money to Kathleen Brown, but the rank 
and file membership, the working men and women of California, these are the 
Pete Wilson supporters," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Gov. Wilson's campaign financing.

NATURE LOVERS GET RARE TOUR OF PRESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pete DeSimone, manager of the Starr Ranch Sanctuary, watched with slightly 
narrowed eyes as cars began filling up an open meadow. Nearby, vendors hawked 
T-shirts and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little strange," DeSimone said softly, leaning against a flatbed 
truck. "This place is usually so quiet. But I expect the deer will be back a 
half-hour after it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in more than 20 years, the National Audubon Society opened 
the 4,000-acre wilderness preserve to the public over the weekend, offering 
about 500 nature lovers a rare glimpse of unspoiled Southern California 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 A diverse ecosystem of dense, wooded canyons and golden hills, Starr Ranch 
Sanctuary is a wilderness laboratory adjacent to Cleveland National Forest in 
southeast Orange County. Typically, the only visitors are wildlife researchers 
and Audubon members on the occasional tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "This open house is a goodwill offer to the public," said Audubon spokesman 
Ken Fortune. "Starr Ranch is a beautiful place, and this is the kind of day we 
want people to remember when they go home." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slightly overcast start, the sun smiled on visitors the rest of 
Saturday as they set off on guided walking tours of the sanctuary. They learned 
about ecologically threatened coastal sage vegetation, low-growing plants that 
cling to steep foothills and cliffs in semiarid Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good day for bird-watching. Yellow rump warblers, scrub jays, 
dark-eyed juncos and many other species dotted the tops of tall thistles and 
sang from sprawling sycamore and oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the deer did take cover, some of the bolder residents of the 
sanctuary came out to play. An Audubon volunteer found a dusky brown tarantula 
ambling slowly along the ground near sanctuary headquarters. He let the 
arachnid crawl up his arm and held it high as a crowd gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 With a look of fear, visitor Stacy Strain hesitantly extended her hand toward 
the tarantula. Her expression shifted to wonderment as, one hairy segmented leg 
at a time, the spider stepped gently onto her palm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so light," the Dana Point resident said. "It's like having a breath of 
air walk on you." 
</P>
<P>
 At display booths set up by local Audubon chapters, visitors had close 
encounters with snakes and red-tailed hawks and stroked mountain lion pelts. 
</P>
<P>
 During a lunch break, the group sat at picnic tables in the meadow and 
listened as DeSimone described the sanctuary and its mission. He stressed that 
housing developments have caused coastal sage to disappear from many areas in 
Southern California, making the preservation of Starr Ranch Sanctuary very 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are Mediterranean species here that are found nowhere else in the 
world," DeSimone said. "When they're gone, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Starr Ranch Sanctuary has been closed to the public since it was donated 
to the National Audubon Society in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Audubon Society plans to allow the public to return in the future 
-- by invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad you're here," DeSimone told the group. "But I hope I don't 
see you hop over the fence with a bicycle after this is over."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / OAKLAND MAYOR; AFRICAN AMERICAN POLITICAL DYNASTY IS 
THREATENED; CHINESE AMERICAN CHALLENGER TED DANG HAS INCUMBENT ELIHU HARRIS IN 
A TIGHT RACE. MANY VOTERS VOICE FRUSTRATION OVER THE SLOW PACE OF ECONOMIC 
REVITALIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent sun-drenched Saturday morning, mayoral contender Ted Dang, his 
7-year-old son and a campaign volunteer hopped into the candidate's Lexus and 
drove to a predominantly black neighborhood in one of this city's poorer 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese American real estate developer knocked on doors and introduced 
himself as the election opponent of Mayor Elihu Harris, the African American 
incumbent who has alienated some voters with a personal style often described 
as abrasive and short-tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have any concerns you would like me to address?" Dang asked the 
residents, who beheld him wonderingly from behind security screen doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Chinese immigrants and a newcomer to politics, Dang has emerged as 
a surprisingly formidable challenger in a city that for nearly 18 years has 
elected African American mayors, a city of great wealth and extreme poverty 
that is still reeling from the shocks of a major earthquake in 1989 and a 
deadly fire in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang's strong appeal is telling, a reflection of Oakland's frustration over 
the slow pace of promised economic revitalization, the growing clout of the 
city's Asian American community and lingering bitterness over the way Oakland 
responded to the fire that killed 25 people and destroyed nearly 3,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, Dang represents desired change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oakland is like L.A.," said Edward Blakely, dean of USC's school of urban and 
regional planning. "L.A. had its riots and earthquake, Oakland had its 
earthquake and its fire. The kind of spirit that was in Oakland was so shaken 
and then kind of crushed by those two events." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that an Asian American could topple a black mayor in the 
state's largest city with an African American plurality is viewed by some 
Oaklanders as a sign of just how multicultural their city has become. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oakland is widely perceived as a black city, no racial group has a 
majority. No single census tract is made up entirely of one race. Blacks make 
up about 44% of the population, followed by whites (33%), Asians (15%) and 
other races. About 14% of the city's population have Spanish surnames, some of 
whom may also be included in the black, white or other categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang's inroads into the African American community, particularly its 
well-to-do segment, prompted former Mayor Lionel Wilson to warn that blacks 
would face an irreversible erosion of their hard-won political power should 
Dang win on Nov. 8. Wilson's brother, attorney Warren Wilson, is co-chairman of 
Dang's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see black folks tell me they are going to vote for a Chinese man," the 
city's first black mayor was quoted as telling an NAACP gathering in August, 
"it makes me angry. . . . If Ted Dang wins, the white folks will be standing in 
line to take it (power) away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dang, 43, and Harris, 47, are running neck and neck among voters most likely 
to go to the polls. Harris, however, holds a comfortable lead among all 
registered voters and remains the front-runner. Each is expected to spend 
$200,000, the ceiling for a general election campaign in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Harris and Dang are Democrats, but Harris has the support of the party 
establishment. A former three-term assemblyman, he is known as a savvy, 
energetic mayor who brought federal money to Oakland, reached out to the 
neighborhoods and secured the promise of a state office building that will be 
named after him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor also has offended many constituents with an impatient and at 
times condescending manner in public. A city councilwoman who is now supporting 
him once wore a sling on her arm after she claimed he twisted it at a council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang, who had almost no name recognition before the June primary, is a 
prosperous developer who has modeled his campaign after that of Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan, passing out booklets containing his "action plan" for 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Slender and slightly hunched at the shoulders, the cleanshaven, clean-cut Dang 
is polite and articulate, but far from dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
 A former chamber of commerce leader, he was born in west Oakland, grew up in 
Chinatown and speaks with a trace of an accent. He bills himself as a 
businessman who will cure the city's ills by trimming government, working with 
business and adding police. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang's appeal, however, appears to stem less from any of his positions than 
from a general sense of frustration that Oakland has not taken off economically 
after two decades of promises of an economic revival. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jack London Square, one of the most scenic parts of the city, luxury boats 
are moored alongside restaurants, a new, super-sized bookstore is open for 
business and a jazz club is scheduled to open late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the aura of progress in this bay-front setting is deceiving. Dozens of 
shops built at the direction of the city's port are empty, their window 
displays of fine clothing and glassware merely a sham. The doors are locked, 
the interiors unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 The proprietor of an ethnic clothing store, one of the few merchants open for 
business in the new retail section, lamented that she sees not a single 
customer on some days. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is similar in other parts of Oakland that have received 
government-initiated face-lifts: The exteriors are pretty, but prosperity has 
been elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city's two sports teams may not be secure. The Oakland A's are for 
sale and the Warriors have talked of relocating across the bay to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oakland has had a lot of bad luck. . . ." said USC's Blakely, who lived here 
for 20 years and still owns a home in the city. "But in terms of all the cities 
in the state, Oakland is probably in the best position for economic recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the city's port is strong and its airport one of the fastest 
growing in the country. Middle-class Asians and Latinos are moving here, he 
said, and the city has successfully attracted a lot of employers during the 
past 10 years. He predicted the stores at Jack London Square eventually will be 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the economy, many Oakland residents fret about their troubled 
schools and violent crime in some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Gee, a Dang supporter, said she was horrified recently when her 
elderly mother explained why she took more money than necessary to the grocery 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'You know, they won't kick you so hard if you have something to 
give them,' " Gee said. "My mother carries mug money." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing influence of the city's Asian community, as well as the gloomy 
perceptions, have helped propel Dang from a political unknown into a serious 
candidate. The city's Asian community has more than doubled over the past 
several years, primarily because of an influx of Southeast Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Year Round School is a symbol of that growth. Once predominantly 
African American, its enrollment is now heavily Asian. The surrounding 
neighborhood, known as New Chinatown, is sprinkled with stores with signs in 
Chinese, Cambodian and Laotian, a less prosperous version of Oakland's older, 
bustling Chinatown located closer to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Run-down, two-story wood-frame houses with chain-link fences surround the 
school, which in addition to earthquake and fire drills has crime drills: Five 
bells ring when a shooting is in progress nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Chinese Americans have been elected to the school board, and Dang's 
supporters are working hard to get out the Asian vote on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't be the majority," said Gee, who complains of hearing gunshots at 
night in her middle-class China Hill neighborhood, "we can at least be the 
swing vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Harris and Dang say the election will be determined by turnout. If Harris 
gets voters in the city's poorer and predominantly African American flatlands 
to the polls, he probably will defeat Dang. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang's primary strength lies in the wooded hills, where expensive homes and 
stunning regional parks are reached by winding mountain roads. That is where 
Harris lives, but many of his neighbors voted for Dang in the June primary out 
of anger over the city's handling of the 1991 fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris had been in office less than a year when city firefighters left the 
scene of a still smoldering fire that later became an inferno in the hills. A 
troubled city communications system, since replaced, was blamed for some of the 
Fire Department's problems in fighting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang's home was one of those that burned, and he tells audiences of sleeping 
with his family at his brother's house with two paper bags containing all his 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dang is a fire survivor and was head of a neighborhood group after the fire 
-- before he ever decided to run for mayor," said Robert Bruce, who started a 
newspaper for fire victims after his home burned. "And that counts for 
something."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; MOMENTUM ON HER SIDE, BROWN SAYS; SPEAKING TO 
LATINO SUPPORTERS IN PICO RIVERA, DEMOCRAT ATTACKS WILSON FOR BACKING PROP. 
187. HE DEFENDS THE MEASURE IN ELK GROVE APPEARANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown, claiming momentum is with her, campaigned 
aggressively against Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in traditional Democratic 
constituencies Sunday, attempting to energize the sort of party turnout she 
needs to defeat Wilson on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Wilson exchanged escalating charges on fiscal issues and Proposition 
187 during the day, with Wilson speaking to GOP volunteers in Elk Grove, near 
Sacramento, and Contra Costa County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh boy. We are on the move," Brown told several hundred Latinos, including 
most of the Los Angeles area's Latino political leaders, at a get-out-the-vote 
rally in Pico Rivera Sunday afternoon. Earlier, Brown followed party tradition 
by making a circuit of black churches in South Los Angeles for brief talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown accused Wilson of trying to divide Californians along racial and class 
lines in his support of Proposition 187, the initiative ballot measure that 
proposes to deny most state-financed social services and education to illegal 
immigrants and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 In urging supporters in Elk Grove to vote for Proposition 187, Wilson said it 
is a matter of "simple fairness." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are demanding is simple fairness, fairness for our taxpayers and 
fairness for people in California who are needy legal residents who cannot 
receive services because instead we are providing it under federal mandate to 
illegal immigrants," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's wrong," he added. "It is unfair. We are not going to put up with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, speaking at a union hall in Pico Rivera, said Wilson's promise to cut 
taxes in a second term is a sign of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows his Proposition 187 is going down and he knows that he is going to 
go down with it," she said. "It is the act of a desperate man trying to hold 
onto power." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Wilson "lied" four years ago when he said he was the only candidate 
who could balance the state budget without raising taxes. Taxes were raised by 
$7 billion the following year, she noted, and Wilson failed to follow through 
on a proposal to cut middle-class taxes in this last budget year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete's got a new idea, nine days before the election," Brown said. "He tells 
people he's going to give them a tax cut. Do you believe him? It's 
trick-or-treat Pete." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls have shown sharp declines in public support for Proposition 187. 
But the measure still holds a relatively substantial lead. Brown appeared to be 
narrowing the gap with Wilson as well, but her numbers were not moving as 
markedly as those on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, speaking to party volunteers at a steak-and-oyster feed with several 
other candidates, sarcastically praised Brown for having "the good judgment" to 
stay out of the fight over issues such as workers' compensation, welfare reform 
and criminal sentencing, but attacked the Democratic candidate for her position 
on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking out over several hundred Republican Party volunteers, Wilson said he 
saw people from all over the world. He introduced several people present -- 
including the chairman of the California Republican Party -- who are legal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nation of immigrants and proud of it," he said. "We built this 
nation with the sweat and the courage of legal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 But illegal immigration, the governor said, is wrong and a drain on the 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Brown's criticism of him for carrying over an "accumulated 
deficit" in the budget every year ignores the costs imposed on the state by the 
federal government's failure to stop illegal immigration and its refusal to pay 
for the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not an accumulated deficit, but an illegal immigrant deficit," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson attacked Brown for proposing to float a five-year bond issue to erase 
the budget deficit, saying it would add "insult to injury" by adding $370 
million in interest costs while relieving the federal government of its 
responsibility to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Wilson, however, the state has been borrowing every year and paying even 
higher interest because it costs more to borrow money at short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates plan to stump most of California during the final full week of 
the campaign. Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are expected to 
campaign in California for Brown and Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: HUFFINGTON'S HOUR FOR MORE THAN MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "He's toast," says a GOP strategist, referring to Rep. Mike Huffington. Done. 
Finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't got the style or the presence to turn it around. Stylistically, 
he's a pussycat." 
</P>
<P>
 This savvy political veteran, who understandably does not want to be 
identified, was speculating about voter reaction to the disclosure that 
Huffington employed an illegal immigrant for a little more than four years to 
care for his two children. The Senate candidate briefly denied it, then fessed 
up after learning The Times was breaking the story the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 That was last Thursday -- one week after Huffington had created his petard by 
endorsing Proposition 187, which would bar illegal aliens from most public 
services and require school and health officials to turn in suspects. The GOP 
candidate complained about "the weakness of our political leaders to enforce 
the immigration laws." 
</P>
<P>
 After the nanny story broke, Huffington said it actually was his wife who had 
hired the illegal immigrant, although he assumed full responsibility. "We have 
made a mistake," he said. "(But) who among us has not broken the law? Who among 
us has not rolled through a stop sign? . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was more than just "a" mistake. Huffington also admitted not 
paying some taxes for the nanny. And two other illegal immigrants reportedly 
were hired temporarily by his wife, Arianna Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington is dead politically, the Republican strategist theorizes, because 
he never had much going for him in California anyway. He's newly arrived from 
Texas with an oil fortune created by his father. Here, he has no reservoir of 
goodwill. It's not like Massachusetts voters easing up on Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy for old times' sake. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also no foundation of party support. Huffington is welcomed by the GOP 
Establishment because he's willing to spend his own millions and not compete 
with other candidates for campaign contributions. He brought his own food and 
drink to the party. By Election Day, it's estimated, he will have written 
personal checks in the astronomical range of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a popular bumper strip being circulated among volunteers for Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein: "Make him spend it all, Dianne." 
</P>
<P>
 That can't happen. Huffington's too rich. Besides, there's the law of 
diminishing returns. "He's maxed out," says the GOP guru. "He can't spend any 
more and get much more out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Huffington's spending has been for negative TV ads aimed at tearing 
down Feinstein. That much has worked. Her favorability rating has plunged from 
63% in March to 41% a week ago, based on Times polling. But Huffington's own 
favorability rating is even worse, a paltry 27%. He hasn't run enough positive 
ads to build up his popularity, so he's particularly vulnerable to nannygate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he'll try to explain it in a new TV ad. As late as Friday, Huffington's 
advisers had hoped this would all blow over by today. The strategy was to 
ignore the nanny and change the subject. No chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein pounced immediately with big buys of radio and TV spots. "Politician 
Michael Huffington talks tough about illegal immigrants, but now Huffington 
admits that for years he employed an illegal immigrant," her ads say. "Now we 
Californians are finally beginning to know Congressman Huffington -- the Texas 
oil millionaire Californians just can't trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Hypocrisy, mistrust and carpetbagging all wrapped neatly into one 30-second 
ad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everything the sage strategist says makes sense. Yet, Huffington trailed 
Feinstein by only three percentage points in Times polling of likely voters 
just before they learned of the nanny. And he had some momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Another GOP operative, veteran consultant Sal Russo, insists that although 
Huffington has been embarrassed, he should survive nannygate. "This is part of 
life in California, where two-income families depend on household services and 
garden help from people of dubious immigration status," he reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But few Californians who hire illegal immigrants likely would mount a 
platform, as Huffington did, and hail Proposition 187 as "the first step toward 
finally enforcing our immigration laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington wouldn't have either if he'd told his advisers about the 
undocumented nanny. At the least, he would have simultaneously endorsed 187 and 
disclosed her himself, rationalizing that this particular illegal immigrant was 
acceptable because she never used public services. A preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
 But "they (candidates) never tell ya the truth," says the anonymous 
strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 With Huffington, chalk it up to lack of political experience. That's something 
even his money can't buy.

POPE NAMES 30 NEW CARDINALS, INCLUDING 2 U.S. ARCHBISHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II on Sunday named 30 new cardinals, including the archbishops 
of Baltimore and Detroit and the first cardinals from Sarajevo and two former 
East Bloc states. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope's naming of Vinko Puljic as cardinal from Sarajevo reflects his long 
support for Bosnia-Herzegovina's besieged capital, which he had hoped to visit 
Sept. 8 but could not because of security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion of churchmen from Albania and the former Soviet republic of 
Belarus, and the naming of a Czech cardinal, represents an opening to the 
former Communist countries of the east. 
</P>
<P>
 He also named cardinals from Vietnam and Cuba, the first from the Caribbean 
country under leader Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishops William Keeler of Baltimore and Adam Maida of Detroit were the 
Americans selected. The Pope had planned to visit Keeler's archdiocese this 
month, but his U.S. visit was postponed due to health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeler, 63, is the president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops 
and thus the church's chief spokesman in the United States. Ordained in 1955, 
he was an expert adviser to Pope John XXIII at the Second Vatican Council in 
1962-65 and was bishop of Harrisburg, Pa., before being named to head the 
Baltimore archdiocese in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also become an ecumenical diplomat, smoothing relations between Jews 
and Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 Maida was ordained in Pittsburgh in 1956 and became bishop of Green Bay, Wis., 
in 1984. The Pope named him head of the 1.5-million-member Detroit archdiocese 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The pontiff also named Jan Schotte, a Belgian who heads the bishops' synod, to 
the post of cardinal. The multilingual Schotte, who has close contacts with 
cardinals and bishops around the world, is considered the Pope's close ally. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul made the announcement in his regular Sunday address to the faithful 
from his window over St. Peter's Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Applause rose among the thousands of people there when the Pope pronounced the 
Sarajevo archbishop's name. Puljic, who is 49, is the youngest of all the 
cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement Sunday was an important step toward ensuring that one of the 
Pope's men will be the next leader of the world's 950 million Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 When the title of cardinal is bestowed on the 30 men at a Nov. 26 
ecclesiastical meeting, John Paul will have filled the 24 openings in the 
120-member body of cardinals eligible to choose his successor. Only cardinals 
under the age of 80 can vote -- and six of the 30 new appointees will be older 
than that by the time of the Nov. 26 ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 103 of the 120 have been named during the 16 years of his papacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The new cardinals, representing 24 countries, "reflect in a significant way 
the universality of the church with the multiplicity of its ministers," the 
Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many also share the Pope's image of a conservative church dedicated to 
social justice.

AT LEAST 26 DIE IN 2 SIBERIAN AIR CRASHES; RUSSIA'S 1994 TOLL UP TO 287; 
SAFETY: OFFICIALS HAD BEEN REASSURING FLIERS ABOUT AIRLINES THAT SPLIT OFF FROM 
FORMER SOVIET CARRIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 26 people were killed in two separate weekend airplane crashes in 
Siberia, authorities said Sunday, heightening concern over safety on Russia's 
newly privatized airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The crashes Saturday brought the number of people killed in Russian air 
disasters this year to at least 287, compared with 221 deaths in all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has lost control over the situation," an officer of the 
Transportation Ministry's aviation department said Sunday. "Privatizing 
Aeroflot (the former Soviet state carrier) was a colossal stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 The two accidents came just as Russian and U.S. officials were reassuring 
frightened fliers that air safety was improving after a disastrous record in 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 In one infamous catastrophe, tapes from a "black box," or flight recorder, 
revealed that an Aeroflot pilot's teen-age son was at the controls of a 
European-made Airbus 310 when it went into a tailspin and crashed in 
Novokuznetsk in March, killing 75 people. Expatriates have taken to calling 
Aeroflot "Scare-oflot" or "Aero-plop." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sign of reviving confidence, the U.S. government lifted a ban earlier 
this month on federal employees traveling on Russian airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the State Department had warned citizens of the hazards of flying 
here now that Aeroflot has broken up into about 320 different national and 
regional airlines. U.S. government employees were instructed to stay off these 
"Baby-flots" except in case of emergency. At an Oct. 14 news conference, U.S. 
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering rescinded that ban, announcing that a thorough 
review by about 30 Russian and 25 U.S. aviation experts had given Russia 
"minimally passing marks" for air safety oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts' report, however, warned that "immediate steps must be taken to 
avoid slippage into unacceptable levels." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. government employees are now permitted to travel on Russian carriers that 
are certified to operate internationally, meaning they must meet a higher 
safety standard than other Russian carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy officials could not say Sunday whether Yakutavia and Aeronika, the 
airlines involved in Saturday's crashes, were on the list of U.S.-approved 
carriers. But the Transportation Ministry spokesman said the airlines were not 
accredited for international travel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first crash, an Aeronika Antonov 12 flying from Sakhalin in the Russian 
Far East bound for Yermolino in the European part of Russia crashed as it was 
trying to land for refueling in Ust-Ilimsk, about 385 miles north of Irkutsk. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane burst into flames about a mile from the runway and crashed into a 
mountain, killing all 21 people aboard, according to the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was carrying 12 tons of fish products and four automobiles, the 
Interfax news agency reported, raising the possibility that overloading was to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee's flight safety 
commission earlier this year noted that "frequent cases of carrying 
unregistered passengers and/or cargo have lately become the most widespread 
violation revealed during nearly every air accident investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, ground personnel have reportedly taken bribes in exchange for 
allowing stowaways or extra cargo onto a plane -- sometimes without informing 
the pilot of the cargo's true weight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee's chairwoman, Tatyana G. Anodina, said that officials have 
been cracking down on overloading and that violations have decreased this year. 
Anodina said her agency does not verify the loading practices for non-Russian 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The second crash Saturday involved a small AN-2 plane owned by Yakutavia that 
burst into flames during a crash-landing in the remote village of Batagay in 
the autonomous republic of Yakut-Sakha. Five people were killed, including one 
child, and nine were injured, officials said Sunday. Details of the crash were 
not immediately available.

PRINCE CHARLES REPORTEDLY BACKS SCALING DOWN ROYAL FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Charles, who arrives in Los Angeles today for a five-day visit, 
believes the number of members of the Royal Family must be scaled down if the 
monarchy is to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final excerpt of a new biography of the prince that appeared in the 
London Sunday Times, Charles says there are too many minor royals being 
supported by public funds and too many royal residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, writes that the prince took part in a 
private debate at Buckingham Palace in which senior officials reviewed the 
Royal Family's objectives and how they would be achieved over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimbleby writes that Charles asked, "Is it not part of the problem with the 
media that it is considered in the country at large that there are too many of 
the Royal Family and too much money being spent on them? 
</P>
<P>
 "Would it not be better to sit down and examine how many members of the family 
you actually need?" 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, the public allowances for several royals were cut back, 
and Queen Elizabeth II agreed to pay taxes on her vast fortune for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dimbleby, Charles is happier than he has been for years following 
his separation from Princess Diana -- a break that now seems permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' staff and friends have "seen his sense of humor return, and with it a 
gaiety of spirit that for several years has too often been stifled by 
melancholy." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on television Sunday, Dimbleby said that Charles took a gamble in 
cooperating with the revealing biography. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years his life was covered on the basis of innuendo, concoction, 
distortion and frequently downright lies, week after week after week," Dimbleby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have kept silent about that forever. There are some pontificating 
commentators in the grander newspapers that believe he should have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the decision he made was a gamble, obviously. But if he had stayed 
silent forever, he was not just being assassinated slowly by character 
description in these pages -- he was actually being killed off by the tabloid 
papers." 
</P>
<P>
 Dimbleby professed to be "astonished" at the interpretation in some papers of 
the excerpts, insisting that at no point did he or Charles say that the prince 
was not in love with Diana when they married in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimbleby said Charles and Diana were trapped in "a very difficult marriage" 
but tried to make it work.

 Next week's election could see the Republican Party gain control of the Senate 
for the first time since 1982. Here is a look at some of the key races: 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia: First-term Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb is facing a strong 
challenge from Republican Oliver L. North. Both candidates have been scarred by 
political scandals, and the race is one of the nastiest and most expensive in 
the nation. North has spent a near record $17.5 million so far. J. Marshall 
Coleman, the former state attorney general who lost his bid to win the 
Republican nomination, is running a distant third as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 California: Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, elected to office two years ago, 
has watched a double-digit lead evaporate to less than 3 percentage points 
among likely voters. Her challenger, Republican Rep. Mike Huffington, has spent 
almost $20 million of his personal fortune in what has become the most 
expensive Senate campaign in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska: Sen. Bob Kerrey, former candidate for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, is expected to sail to victory over businesswoman Jan Stoney. The 
National Rifle Assn. has been running ads against Kerrey because of his vote in 
support of President Clinton's crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts: In a wild race that has gone up and down faster than the Dow 
Jones, six-time Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has reclaimed the lead after 
slipping several points behind Republican businessman and political novice Mitt 
Romney. Kennedy's ads have been focusing on his effectiveness and influence in 
Washington, while Romney is highlighting the need for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania: Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford, who came into office in an upset 
victory based largely on an appeal for health care reform, is facing Republican 
Rep. Rick Santorum. A poll last week showed the race in a dead heat among 
likely voters -- with 20% still undecided. Santorum has attacked Wofford for 
his big-government, liberal themes and has even made an issue of Wofford's 
campaign consultants, James Carville. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee: Both Senate seats are up for grabs this year. Democratic incumbent 
Jim Sasser is battling political neophyte and heart surgeon Bill Frist. Sasser 
has made the millionaire's lifestyle an issue in the campaign, while Frist has 
tried to turn the election into a referendum on all Democrats -- lumping Sasser 
with "Ted (Kennedy), (Rep. Dan) Rostenkowski and little slick Will (Clinton)." 
With the retirement of Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), Sasser also is hoping 
to become the new majority leader -- should the Democrats retain control of the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana: Sen. Conrad Burns, the first Montana Republican to hold a Senate seat 
since 1953, is battling Democratic attorney Jack Mudd. While Burns has 
maintained a solid lead in the polls, Mudd is trying to exploit a media 
incident that was created when Burns uttered a racial slur. Abortion rights 
groups also have mobilized to help Mudd. Burns is an abortion foe. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey: In a recent debate, Democratic incumbent Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg 
and state Speaker Chuck Haytaian, a Republican, differed on taxes and crime, 
but managed to avoid key questions on term limits, health care and gun control. 
Lautenberg has condemned Haytaian for appearing on a local talk show whose host 
has made racist remarks on the air. In Haytaian's newest ad, popular Republican 
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman attacked Lautenberg for negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan: In an open race, Republican first-time candidate Spencer Abraham has 
been leading nine-term Democratic Rep. Bob Carr through most of the campaign. 
But recent polls show the candidates in a virtual tie. First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton campaigned for Carr last week, while actor Charlton Heston has 
appeared on behalf of Abraham. Republicans have not held a Michigan Senate seat 
since 1978. Current Makeup of Senate GOP seats: 44 Dem. seats: 56 Of Seats on 
the Ballot . . . Held by GOP: 13 Held by Dems: 22 States where Democrat holds

ISRAEL TO BEGIN REOPENING GAZA CROSSINGS CLOSED AFTER BUS ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel will begin this week reopening Gaza Strip border crossings that were 
sealed after the deadly bombing of a Tel Aviv bus, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
said Sunday. But he promised to do "whatever is needed" to stop violence by 
Palestinian militants. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 Palestinians who live in the PLO-run Gaza Strip have been unable 
to get to their jobs in Israel since Israel closed the borders in response to 
the Oct. 19 bus bombing that killed 23 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin met for an hour in Casablanca on Sunday with Palestine Liberation 
Organization leader Yasser Arafat before the opening of a Middle East and North 
African summit aimed at promoting economic development in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their first meeting since the Tel Aviv bombing and the signing of the 
Israel-Jordan peace treaty, which Arafat has strongly criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians had demanded a complete and immediate reopening of the Gaza 
crossings. Rabin said he told Arafat that, starting Tuesday, "we gradually will 
lift the closure." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Palestinian officers will be allowed to take up positions at two 
border crossings, the Allenby Bridge between Jordan and the West Bank, and the 
Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said he and Arafat would talk again in a week. A Palestinian source 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting would take place next 
Monday in Erez, the main Gaza-Israel crossing.

U.S. TROOPS IN HAITI TO GET R&R AT CRUISE LINE RESORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Army has established the first official recreation site for U.S. 
forces in Haiti at this Atlantic coast village in northern Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 After enduring six weeks of Haiti's muddy season, U.S. troops are now able to 
rest and relax at a cruise line's beach resort about five miles from Cap 
Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the September, 1991, coup that toppled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, Labadee was a popular port of call for the Miami-based Royal 
Caribbean cruise line. As many as 5,000 passengers a week enjoyed its beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 60 U.S. troops arrived for a trial day of recreation last week on 
the Army transport ship Kennesaw Mountain from the port of Cap Haitien. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 soldiers of the 10th Mountain Light Infantry Division, 2nd 
Brigade, from Ft. Drum, N.Y., are deployed in Cap Haitien. They are due to 
visit the resort in shifts.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PRESIDENT GOING ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL -- FOR BILL CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As President Clinton begins a final, weeklong sprint to Election Day, his 
energies are focused not only on a clutch of endangered Democratic 
congressional candidates, but also on one key figure whose name appears on no 
ballot this year: Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 While he crosses the country in an effort to preserve Democratic control in 
Congress and state capitals, Clinton is using the campaign season to begin the 
formidable job of rebuilding his own political fortunes for 1996. In his choice 
of campaign destinations and rhetorical themes, he is trying to reshape the way 
voters look at him at a time when potential Republican presidential contenders 
are only beginning to jockey for position. 
</P>
<P>
 While a President never lacks for speaking opportunities, the fall campaign 
season gives Clinton a concentrated series of forums for reaching voters in a 
purely political context that is not ordinarily available. He can speak not 
only to the general electorate, but also to the party activists whose loyalty 
he must hold -- and in some cases regain -- to prepare for Republican and 
possibly even Democratic rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate concern is the midterm elections, says one Administration aide, 
adding that "he's got to look ahead to 1996 -- and think about how he's doing 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Baggett, the White House political director, observed with a chuckle: "Do 
you think I'd be very believable if I said the President of the United States 
didn't think of 1996?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's destinations are in part determined by the location of tight races. 
At the same time, many places are out of bounds because of his unpopularity in 
certain regions of the country. It is no accident, aides acknowledge, that 
Clinton has almost entirely written off the Southern and Rocky Mountain states 
to concentrate on the Northeastern, Midwestern and far Western states that he 
must assemble to win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 After trips last week to California, Washington state and Ohio, Clinton's 
schedule this week will take him back to those states and to Pennsylvania, 
Michigan, New York, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Vice President Al 
Gore and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the Administration's other senior 
Southerners, have been handed the job of representing Clinton in the Southern 
and border states. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats' national campaign strategy calls for Clinton to concentrate on 
contrasting their party's agenda with Republican proposals that Democrats say 
would return the country to 1980s-style Reaganism. But as he moves around the 
country, Clinton veers time and again from this script to talk about his own 
record, and to ask for more time to accomplish the objectives he set out in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, during a fund-raising appearance in San Francisco, Clinton devoted 
six paragraphs of a speech to praising the event's beneficiary, gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown. In another 60 paragraphs, Clinton uncoiled a detailed 
defense of what he has accomplished in his first 21 months, focusing in 
particular on his efforts for California, whose 45 electoral votes are the most 
crucial ingredient for any 1996 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He touched on the $11-billion federal contribution for earthquake relief, the 
decontrol of once-embargoed high-technology exports, stepped-up border 
enforcement, shipbuilding contracts for San Diego, a new $2-billion contract 
for the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories and trade negotiations that enabled 
U.S. agribusiness to sell rice to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Alluding to California's critical contribution to his election, he said that 
when the state has encountered a problem, "I have tried to help you solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not pretend that there is nothing left to be done," he acknowledged, 
but asked voters to give him credit for "a pretty good start." 
</P>
<P>
 Another regular feature of Clinton's speeches is the Administration's recent 
string of foreign policy accomplishments, which, by his account, include U.S. 
diplomacy or intervention in Haiti, North Korea, South Africa, the Persian Gulf 
and even Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign policy, like health care, "is just not an issue in the campaigns," 
said Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. But 
Clinton's comments serve a different purpose, he says. The President's 
objective is to convince Americans that he has the basic foreign policy 
competence that the public considers necessary for all Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is clearly delighted to be immersed once more in the campaign trail 
environment that was so rewarding for him two years ago. His enthusiasm comes 
through clearly in speeches, even those before tiny fund-raiser crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 And he often lingers long into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 His extended remarks in San Francisco last week delayed his departure for 
Seattle, stretching out his workday to nearly 24 hours. But it didn't faze him. 
"I wouldn't trade this for anything," he gushed to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts argue that it makes sense for Clinton to focus on shoring up his 
own popularity at these appearances because any President's ability to persuade 
voters to back the party's candidate is quite limited. (Even Ronald Reagan, 
they say, could add only a few percentage points of support to candidates' poll 
numbers, and even then only for a few days.) 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's final week of travel reflects the White House's understanding of 
what he clearly can accomplish for candidates: raising money and rousing a 
demoralized Democratic base. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until now, his appearances for candidates have been almost exclusively 
fund-raisers. But this week he will show up at nearly as many public rallies, 
as he visits a series of cities that have both tight races and huge Democratic 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 He will campaign for Sen. Harris Wofford and gubernatorial candidate Mark 
Singel in Pennsylvania; senatorial hopefuls Joel Hyatt in Ohio and Rep. Bob 
Carr in Detroit, and New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. In New York, Clinton and 
Cuomo will share the stage with New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who 
last week crossed party lines to endorse the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Clinton returns to California to appear with Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
and Brown, and to take part in get-out-the-vote rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials maintain Clinton's recent appearances have bumped up the 
poll numbers of several candidates, including Brown, Carr and Bill Curry, the 
gubernatorial candidate in Connecticut. "Our numbers have been going up, and so 
have the candidates," Baggett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some outside analysts say they aren't convinced that Clinton has contributed 
that much in some races. But they concede that the party's candidates are 
likely to fare poorly in the tight races if Democratic turnout is low. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in motivation is evident in an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll 
released last week. Of those surveyed, 65% of Republicans but only 55% of 
Democrats expressed "great interest" in the election. Similarly, 71% of 
religious fundamentalists, who tend to vote Republican, expressed great 
interest, compared with only 53% of black Americans, who vote in greater 
numbers for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton's travels manage to help beleaguered Democratic candidates, it 
seems no more than fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's shortcomings have clearly hurt the election prospects of 
Democrats in recent months. Yet some polls show that Democratic congressional 
candidates haven't shared in the bounce that Clinton has enjoyed from recent 
foreign policy gains in the Persian Gulf and Haiti. Although the President's 
approval ratings have risen to nearly 50%, respondents in those polls are still 
favoring Republican over Democratic congressional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the bleak outlook for Democratic candidates makes it all the more 
understandable that Clinton is focusing on his own future, Cook says. 
"Considering how bad it's starting to look out there, maybe it's only natural," 
he said.

 A fictional news broadcast showing gigantic asteroids crash-landing on Earth 
took Americans by surprise, with TV viewers jamming CBS switchboards to find 
out if their world was coming to an end. Titled "Without Warning," the program 
attributed fictional reports of worldwide disaster to news outlets such as 
Reuters and The Associated Press and showed scenes of panic and death on the 
ground, massive tie-ups in the skies above the United States and the collapse 
of the world's stock markets. The broadcast was reminiscent of Orson Welles' 
famous 1938 radio dramatization of H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds"

PEROT VOTERS LEANING TO THE RIGHT IN '94; POLITICS: HIS SUPPORTERS ARE EXPECTED 
TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT TOO 
HAPPY ABOUT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In theory, they are the pivotal part of the American electorate -- the 
critical middle that wishes a pox on all houses of government. And in next 
week's elections, they could tip whether Congress goes Republican or 
Democratic, decide dozens of individual races and forge the direction of 
government for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the Perot vote, that 20% of the electorate that helped Ross Perot 
mount the most successful independent presidential candidacy in 70 years. Now, 
two years later, what remains of his supporters and which way are they leaning? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, Republicans gleefully speculate and Democrats fret, is they are 
going Republican on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the same-sized group (as two years ago), but different people -- and 
it looks pretty grim" for Democrats, said President Clinton's pollster, Stanley 
B. Greenberg. A study by Greenberg in July identified the 20 million Perot 
voters as "the pivotal force in American politics." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, "we wanted to make sure we were splitting the Perot vote in our local 
races," said Republican pollster Linda Divall. "This year we hope to get 60% of 
them." Others predicted that Republicans will get even more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Perot bloc appears to be tipping Senate races in Wyoming, Montana, 
Oklahoma, Michigan and Maine to the Republicans. They are also playing a 
crucial role in pulling voters away from House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.), who could become the first Speaker to lose a reelection bid in 130 
years. And the Perot bloc is hurting even moderate Democratic incumbents in 
dozens of other races, particularly in the West and the Northeast, where 
Perot's appeal is strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot announced two weeks ago that he believes his supporters should back the 
Republican Party. But there are doubts about the power of that endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Perot factor is what I call 'ephemeral heresy,' " said Democratic 
pollster Peter Hart. "They left George Bush for Ross Perot in 1992, and they 
are returning to the Republican Party in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The shifting has occurred as fundamental changes have taken place in the core 
of Perot's support. In the last two years, the Texas billionaire has lost much 
of his appeal among independent middle-class and upper-middle-class 
suburbanites and women. They have been replaced by seething-mad blue-collar 
voters, predominantly men, whom pollsters used to call Ronald Reagan Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Clinton has thoroughly antagonized these angry voters. "They 
are a 10 on the saliva test," said Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who was 
formerly Perot's pollster. "When you mention Washington, they practically spray 
you they get so agitated." 
</P>
<P>
 "Perot had two bases of support -- those who wanted to change government and 
those who wanted to torch it," said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who is 
closely studying the Perot phenomenon. "He kept the torchers; in fact, he got 
more of them, but he lost the changers." 
</P>
<P>
 "His middle-class supporters still like his message, but they have become sour 
about the messenger," Luntz said.  
</P>
<P>
 The shift has also raised doubts about the number of Perot supporters who will 
take the time to vote Nov. 8. An ever-larger percentage of the Perot bloc is 
made up of alienated voters who are less likely to turn out at the polls, 
especially in midterm elections, said Ed Sarpolus, a Michigan pollster who has 
watched the Perot vote in his state. 
</P>
<P>
 Luntz predicted that Perot voters will be 8% to 10% of the midterm electorate. 
Lake predicted that it could be as high as 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also apparently have failed to capture another, potentially more 
promising group of voters -- those who gave their allegiance to Perot two years 
ago but have since turned away. They are considered more volatile than Perot 
devotees and could go for either party in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for my party right now is to appeal to those people who have given up 
on Perot," Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead to 1996, Perot's appeal among Republicans is a double-edged 
sword for the party. His support can be helpful but, if he runs again, he could 
siphon off even more Republican support than he did in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we run three ways with Perot, Clinton goes ahead against Bob Dole," the 
Senate minority leader, Lake said. "Perot even makes it close for Clinton 
against Colin Powell," the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who 
draws high marks in polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican tendencies of Perot supporters also mean that Perot's 
endorsement of Republicans today means less than it once did. Most of his 
supporters would have voted Republican anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even indications that many Perot supporters have stopped listening 
to him. A survey by the Times Mirror Center for The People & The Press last 
week found that only 30% of those who said they were Perot supporters even knew 
of Perot's recommendation to vote Republican, which he made several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the poll found that his endorsements apparently carry little sway 
with other voters. More of those polled said Perot's recommendation makes them 
"less inclined" to vote for Republicans than said it influenced them (7% 
compared with 3%). 
</P>
<P>
 There are some exceptions, however, where Perot supporters or endorsements may 
be swaying voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spokane, Wash., for instance, the local Perot organization, United We 
Stand, America, Inc. has developed credibility in the community and its strong 
anti-incumbent sentiments have hurt Foley greatly, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also apparently has influence when he makes an exception to his general 
endorsement and backs individual Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In Perot's home state of Texas, he has endorsed Gov. Ann Richards over 
Republican George W. Bush. The endorsement could be worth three or four 
percentage points at the polls if Richards publicizes it, Democratic pollster 
Harrison Hickman contended. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado, Perot endorsed Democratic Gov. Roy Romer over former United We 
Stand member Bruce Benson, a Republican. The impact is difficult to assess in a 
race where Romer has built a sizable lead. 
</P>
<P>
 One final question about the Perot phenomenon of 1994 is about the same as it 
was two years ago. What does Perot want? 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties are unclear about his motives in supporting the Republican 
agenda. Democrats believe he is setting up the Republicans for a fall, sensing 
that little will change in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least some Republicans are saying that they believe him. "The man can't 
be President and he probably knows it," Luntz said. "So I have to have some 
faith that his endorsement of Republicans is sincere."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; QUACKENBUSH ADS STRESS CRIME BUT 
IGNORE ISSUES HE WOULD REGULATE; ONE TV COMMERCIAL BY THE REPUBLICAN CRITICIZES 
RIVAL ART TORRES FOR HIS VOTE 16 YEARS AGO ON AN OBSCURE BILL. DEMOCRATS 
CONDEMN THE CAMPAIGN AS A LIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican candidate Charles W. Quackenbush has opened a projected $1-million 
advertising campaign in the insurance commissioner race by making crime the 
only issue, rather than the insurance matters he would confront as 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates in the Republican camp who are running for statewide office 
are using similar tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Assemblyman Quackenbush's ads reaches back 16 years to an obscure bill 
that never won final legislative approval to claim that his Democratic rival, 
state Sen. Art Torres, "voted to allow sex offenders to teach in our public 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the bill shows that the proposed legislation contained only 
technical changes to existing law, which could have made it slightly easier for 
authorities to deny teaching credentials to sex and drug offenders who had been 
formally declared rehabilitated or had charges dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 56-12 vote by which the bill cleared the Assembly on June 8, 1978, when 
Torres was still an Assemblyman, it also won aye votes from such stalwart and 
conservative Republicans as Mike Antonovich, William Dannemeyer, Frank 
Lanterman and then-minority leader Carol Hallett. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded that such lawmakers as Antonovich voted on the measure with Torres, 
Quackenbush spokeswoman Lynne Andersen said: "We're not running against Mike 
Antonovich. If Torres really wanted to be sure that no sex offenders were 
teaching in our public schools, he would have voted against this bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush has also joined with three other candidates in joint ads 
portraying them as crime fighters and ignoring the usual functions of the 
elective jobs they seek. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Republican legislators Bill Jones and Cathie Wright, running for 
secretary of state and lieutenant governor, respectively, and Maureen DiMarco, 
a Democrat who is part of the Wilson Administration and who is running for the 
nonpartisan office of state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Each said the ads were justified. 
</P>
<P>
 John Theiss, a spokesman for the Wright campaign, said that the election of 
four more Republicans to the state Senate would deadlock the body at 20 
Republicans and 20 Democrats, and Wright, as lieutenant governor, would then 
have "an almost daily opportunity" to cast tie-breaking votes to extend the 
death penalty and put additional curbs on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Lapsley, campaign manager for Jones, said his candidate was author of the 
"three strikes" legislation and knows the electorate will appreciate it if he 
mentions it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Smith, campaign manager for DiMarco, said his candidate didn't have enough 
money for ads of her own and thereby had to join with the others. "We would 
love to be doing our own spot, but it's a question of economics," he said. 
"Besides, we find that in our case the voters are most concerned about school 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 For Quackenbush, Andersen said, "I certainly think that Art Torres denying his 
voting record to such an extreme indicates that he feels that crime is an 
important issue to California voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres campaign manager Darrio Frommer responded that there are at least three 
"Quackenbush lies" in the crime ads, to which Torres is obliged to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has refused all joint appearances with Art," Frommer noted of Quackenbush. 
"He doesn't talk to consumer groups. He only talks to insurance people." 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing insurance commissioner, John Garamendi, observed that 
Quackenbush's ads refer to "20-year-old bills," not only about sex and drug 
offenders, but also workers' comp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck Quackenbush has sold out to the insurance industry, so he cannot talk 
about insurance issues," Garamendi said. "They have paid the piper in massive 
campaign contributions to him, and he'll play their tune. So his crime ads are 
a smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen, of the Quackenbush campaign, responded: "I think that Art Torres and 
John Garamendi are seeing that their liberal pasts are catching up to them and 
are afraid for the voters to know the truth. They're actively trying to distort 
the degree of the offense in this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill's original author, Richard Alatorre, now a Los Angeles city 
councilman, said his measure was "an innocuous bill" and the Quackenbush 
campaign's attempt to make something out of it was "at best, dishonest and 
deceiving." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right at the end of a campaign, you are going to distort the truth," he 
added. "This is very typical, and obviously I guess Quackenbush knows he's 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the chairman of the state Republican party, Tirso del 
Junco, asked the state Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate 
whether Torres improperly used $8,000 in campaign contributions to pay for 21 
trips to Sacramento of his two teen-age children after his 1992 divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torres campaign said that nothing illegal occurred, and the children 
frequently traveled to appear at political events, which they said is a 
legitimate use of campaign funds. The Quackenbush campaign said state law makes 
it clear that personal travel of children is not a legitimate campaign expense.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; 7,000 ATTEND PROTEST DENOUNCING PROPOSITION 187 
</P>

<P>
 Amid a sea of red, white and blue American flags, about 7,000 people on Sunday 
attended an anti-Proposition 187 concert in Monterey Park, where they heard 
dozens of bands and speakers denounce the measure as a racist attack on 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "California does not need Proposition 187.California needs human rights for 
all," one of the event organizers, Juan Jose Gutierrez, told the crowd 
assembled at the football stadium at East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
 That theme was repeated throughout the daylong event as the predominantly 
Latino immigrant crowd listened to political speeches and heard banda and 
mariachi music. The event was sponsored by "Contacto/1020," a program on 
Spanish-language talk radio station KTNQ-AM and radio station KLVE-FM. Police 
reported no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to a massive anti-Propostion 187 March on Oct. 16 -- when 
thousands of demonstrators carried Mexican flags -- the organizers of Sunday's 
event sold 3,500 American flags at $3 apiece to help convey an image of 
patriotism. A number of critics had denounced the Mexican flags at the earlier 
march, saying they represented a display of foreign nationalism that played 
into the hands of the pro-187 camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the American flag that people say you don't want to display?" Los 
Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez said in Spanish as the crowds waved 
their small flags in approval. ROBERT J. LOPEZ

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; BROWN DONORS INCLUDE LAWYERS, MOVIE STUDIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the scramble for funds to finance state Treasurer Kathleen Brown's race for 
governor, labor has provided the backbone of her support, but lawyers, wealthy 
business executives, philanthropists and movie studios have also contributed 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Her single top contributor remains the Democratic Governors' Assn., which has 
given her $350,000 through the end of September. The governors' group, which is 
struggling to keep the Democratic Party's grip on state executive offices 
throughout the country, holds regular fund-raisers in Washington, where it can 
tap politically active law firms, corporations and other special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the donors whose cash is apportioned among Democratic gubernatorial 
candidates are cigarette manufacturers and a number of Indian tribes, some of 
which are negotiating agreements with governors in their home states to settle 
disputes over reservation gambling. Records show that Philip Morris contributed 
$8,435 to the Brown campaign through the Democratic governors' group. Other 
contributors include the American Medical Assn., drug manufacturers Eli Elly 
and Pfizer, and Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But as state treasurer, Brown has voluntarily refused to take money from firms 
such as Prudential that compete for the state's bond underwriting business. 
Because of that potential conflict of interest, Brown returned $58,000 to the 
Democratic governors' group. The association set up a separate account that 
meets Brown's requirements and restored $50,000 of the returned money. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has also shunned campaign contributions from lawyers and firms who 
perform legal work on state bond sales for the treasurer's office. Her campaign 
staff says this voluntary rule goes far beyond the requirements of state law, 
which imposes no restrictions at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown has continued to accept donations from other lawyers within those 
firms -- more than $60,000 in a three-month period ending Sept. 30. Brown 
campaign officials contend that there is no conflict of interest in taking 
funds from these individuals, who generally are part of large firms and who do 
no work for the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown draws strong support from lawyers in the state. San Diego plaintiffs' 
attorney William S. Lerach and his firm have contributed $56,000 to Brown's 
race this year. Los Angeles lawyers John and Thomas Girardi, whose firm 
represented Lockheed employees in a series of suits over toxic chemical 
exposure, gave Brown $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Constellation Land Limited Partnership sent $100,000 to the Brown campaign 
this month. The real estate development group is managed by JMB Properties Inc. 
of Chicago. Officials of that company played a key role in the Public Employees 
Retirement System's $400-million investment in Catellus Development Corp. in 
1989. The giant pension fund is still trying to make good on its money after an 
initial paper loss of $300 million. As state treasurer since 1991, Brown served 
on the PERS board when it decided to acquire an even larger share of Catellus. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Rebecca Moores of Sugar Land, Tex., remain Brown's top individual 
contributors. The couple has donated $180,000 in cash and the use of a private 
plane over the past two years. John Moores made a fortune estimated at more 
than $400 million from a Texas company he founded, BMC Software Inc. The couple 
owns extensive property in Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the candidate's mother, Bernice Brown, contributed $10,000 and 
loaned $180,000 to her daughter's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood stars and executives contribute to Brown's race, including former 
Walt Disney Studio executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, $10,000; film producer 
Kathleen Kennedy, $10,250, and actress Jane Fonda, $1,000. Among the studios, 
Paramount Pictures has given her campaign $50,000; the Walt Disney Co., 
$17,500, and Sony Pictures, $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand has contributed $3,000; "The Simpsons" executive producer 
Matt Groening, $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group backing Brown is Agenda for the 90s, a political action 
committee set up a decade ago by San Francisco real estate developer Walter 
Shorenstein and United Auto Workers executive Bruce Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 While the group has generally spent its money on Democratic get-out-the-vote 
efforts, it also gives to individual candidates, including $22,500 to Brown 
this year. A substantial amount of the money that the group has collected came 
from Lee's union.

 8 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Sunday: Democrat Kathleen Brown campaigned in African American 
churches and at a rally of Latino leaders and volunteers in the Los Angeles 
area, claiming that Gov. Pete Wilson's promise of a tax cut in the next four 
years is an act of desperation. Wilson addressed party volunteers and 
supporters in Elk Grove, near Sacramento, and in Contra Costa County, saying 
that passage of Proposition 187 is a matter of fairness to legal residents "who 
cannot receive services because instead we are providing it under federal 
mandate to illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown planned a breakfast and news conference in Sherman Oaks 
this morning, a plant gate appearance in Long Beach and trick-or-treating with 
two of her grandchildren in San Diego. Wilson was scheduled to visit a 
Vacaville biotech plant that is planning expansion, a fund-raising luncheon in 
San Francisco, and a crime victims' meeting in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Sunday: Republican Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles 
endorsed Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein for reelection over her Republican 
foe, Rep. Mike Huffington, and Feinstein accused her opponent of hiding behind 
his wife in the dispute over employment of an illegal immigrant in the 
Huffington household. Huffington, appearing on the ABC television program "This 
Week With David Brinkley," suggested that illegal immigrants could send their 
children to private school to save the state tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Huffington addresses Rotary Club luncheon in Fresno today and 
attends a Tulare County Republican reception in Visalia. Feinstein was to hold 
news conference near Los Angeles International Airport this morning to receive 
endorsements of five big defense firms; planned celebration at Sierra Club 
offices in Los Angeles to mark President Clinton's signing, in Washington D.C., 
of California Desert Protection Act sponsored by Feinstein.

 Three men were presumed dead after their fishing vessel sank in strong winds 
and rough sea off the coast of San Francisco. The Freda-M was 50 nautical miles 
west of San Francisco when it went down shortly before 9:15 p.m. Saturday, said 
Coast Guard Petty Officer Shelly Freier."They went down fast. The Rogy (their 
buddy-ship) was three-quarters of a mile away, and then suddenly they couldn't 
see the Freda-M's lights anymore," said Freier. Winds were at 35 knots and the 
waves were between 13 and 15 feet, Freier said. The Rogy immediately called the 
Coast Guard to report the Freda-M's distress signal, and by the time the Rogy 
arrived, the only trace of the Freda-M was a life raft with an emergency radio 
beacon aboard. Lost were skipper Charlie Cheek of Los Molinos, Ted Horton of 
Moss Landing and Walter Foote of Prunedale. Rescue crews planned to resume 
their search today.

 A motorcyclist fleeing police suddenly stopped and fatally shot himself, 
authorities said.The 18-year-old Hemet man, whose name was withheld pending 
notification of relatives, was carrying a note indicating he planned to kill 
himself on Halloween, said police Sgt. Dennis Love. The motorcycle and the gun 
involved had been reported stolen in Orange County, Love said. The man fled 
when police approached him Saturday afternoon, said Sgt. Kevin Fitzpatrick. 
During the chase the man took off his helmet and threw it toward his pursuers. 
He then stopped, pulled out a gun, and as officers drew their guns, shot 
himself in the head, said Fitzpatrick.

Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get interesting people who know about world affairs on the 
show," said Nick Mamounas, 33, the show's producer. "We're looking for anyone 
-- from educators to writers to politicians -- who has knowledge about the 
world around us."

 The Orange County Transportation Authority is asking for the public's help in 
finding ways to improve transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Public comments are being sought to help OCTA decide whether a rail or other 
high capacity transportation system should be built for a 28-mile-long corridor 
stretching from Fullerton to Irvine, passing through Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials will be deciding what type of system -- bus, rail or special 
car-pool lanes -- should be considered, where the system should go and whether 
it will be underground. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision is expected to be made in early 1996 and the third in a series of 
public meetings on the subject is set for Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. at Irvine City 
Hall, 1 Civic Center Drive.

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; STUDENT GROUP PLANS BLOOD DRIVE AT COLLEGE

 A student group is organizing a blood drive Tuesday and Wednesday at Cal Sate 
Fullerton's Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will run from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and the goal is to get at least 
250 people to give blood, said J.J. Garuba, spokesman for the Interfraternal 
Greek Council, the group sponsoring the Red Cross drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a real shortage of blood donation lately, and the Red Cross is 
really looking at college campuses to increase donations," said Garuba, 23, a 
political science student. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a really worthwhile cause because every pint of blood saves 
between four to seven lives, on average." MIMI KO

LOCAL ELECTIONS / LA HABRA CITY COUNCIL; FOCUS IS ON BOOSTING BUSINESS, 
BATTLING GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Battling gangs and building business are the hottest issues in the minds of 
this city's five City Council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the candidates -- Rose Hernandez Espinoza, Kent A. Roberts, Dorothy 
May Rush, Paul G. Thornburg and Mayor David M. Cheverton -- vying for two seats 
in the Nov. 8 council election has unique strategies for tackling the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, hailed by leaders nationwide for her successful after-school garage 
tutoring program for some of the city's poorest children, says education is 
key. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gangs can be phased out by tutoring the youngsters, educating them, giving 
them hope and vision and getting their parents involved," said Espinoza, 42, a 
computer design drafter. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants her 3-year-old tutoring program duplicated in neighborhoods 
throughout the city as a deterrent to gangs. Dozens of children and their 
parents have learned to read, write and communicate through MAS, or Motivating 
Adolescents to Succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza also proposes creating a youth forum to allow high school students to 
voice their ideas for solutions to the city's gang problems because "if we 
continue to have gang activity and graffiti, businesses will not be attracted 
to La Habra." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, the 60-year-old grandmother best known for her anti-gang activism, 
believes the city could be rid of gangs by increasing police patrols and 
cracking down on landlords who fail to meet city codes and keep their 
properties clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to clean up this city and make it a better place to live," said 
Rush, a retired dressmaker. "I believe the community-oriented policing that the 
Police Department will be beginning soon will be the solution to gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, whose home has been shot at several times, also is known in town as the 
woman who pushed the City Council to enact a strict anti-blight ordinance. 
After years of discussion, the council adopted the law that, among other 
things, prohibits people from drying clothes on their front yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rush said she disagrees with the clothes-drying ban and vows to abolish 
the ordinance if she is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, 52, who served on the City Council from 1981 to 1986, said the city 
is in desperate need of a long-term plan to revitalize the older commercial and 
residential areas, attract new businesses and encourage public participation in 
local government policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
 He has produced a 22-page document outlining how his goals can be 
accomplished. In it, Roberts, a real estate investor, proposes establishing a 
community newsletter, holding town hall meetings, televising City Council 
meetings, persuading businesses to provide job opportunities and mentor 
programs to youths as a way to deter gang involvement and beautifying 
commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to establish more alliances with businesses, residents and 
educational institutions to gather information to allow the city to make more 
informed decisions on current problems," said Roberts, who joined hundreds of 
residents who recently persuaded the City Council to prohibit a bikini bar from 
opening in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornburg, 52, who served on the Planning Commission from 1984 to 1993, said 
La Habra needs to ease regulations on small businesses in order to attract more 
to the city. Also, it needs to educate residents to shop at stores inside the 
city rather than the shopping malls outside it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The survival of business leads to the generation of funds to increase our 
Police Department and other services to our residents," Thornburg said. "Our 
streets are deteriorating and our infrastructure is deteriorating but I think a 
solution is to increase our business climate here." Cheverton, 35, is the only 
incumbent in the race, having served on the council since 1990. Councilman 
William D. Mahoney, 54, who was first elected in 1982, has decided not to run 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheverton said at a recent candidates' forum that his record speaks for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 During his term on the council, Cheverton has voted to approve the $2-million 
project to expand and upgrade the Police Department's facility; the 
construction of a new Super Kmart store, which is expected to provide 700 jobs; 
the construction of the city's new Community Services Building, and the 
purchase of a $60,000 high-tech fingerprinting system for the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will continue to vote for items that will help improve the city in many 
ways and what I've done so far has done that," said Cheverton, a communications 
director of a nonprofit agency in Irvine.

AN EXCHANGE OF WORDS, THEN A HAIL OF GUNFIRE; CRIME: A CROWDED PARTY IN SANTA 
ANA ENDS WITH A LATE-NIGHT BARRAGE OF BULLETS. ONE MAN IS DEAD AND ANOTHER IS 
IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One man was killed and another critically wounded early Sunday when a large 
party at a southwest Santa Ana home erupted in a barrage of gunfire between 
suspected gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an out-and-out gangfest shootout," said Sgt. Brian Collins of the 
Santa Ana Police Department. "As people were calling in (to police), our 
dispatchers could hear an extreme amount of gunshots." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins described the gathering as a "humongous party . . . the back yard was 
filled" and another 100 people, most of them "party crashers," were in the 
street when the shooting started. 
</P>
<P>
 "A car drove up and words were exchanged and then blam, blam, blam," Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Cabrera, 24, whose address was unknown, was found dead at 2:24 a.m. 
behind the wheel of a car that had left the party in the 1700 block of West 
Adrin Way, driven up on the sidewalk and crashed into a tree about 100 yards 
away on Linda Way, according to Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been shot twice, once sideways through the chest, and was pronounced 
dead at the scene, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded man, Richard Linares, 21, of Santa Ana, was found lying in the 
street near his parked car and taken by paramedics to UCI Medical Center, where 
he was listed in critical condition, Collins said. Collins said he had been 
shot twice with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun. "Somebody apparently just 
drove up and started firing," Collins said. "Our officers said there was a 
large amount of expended rounds in the street, which means there must have been 
a lot for them to even mention it." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said a car speeding away from the shooting with its headlights off was 
stopped by police. Two passengers escaped police on foot but the driver, Israel 
Cervantes, was caught and was being questioned by members of the city's gang 
detail, Collins said. Cervantes, whose age and place of residence were not 
available, was charged with evading arrest and booked into Santa Ana City Jail, 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who gathered Sunday recalled hearing an argument and then several 
exchanges of gunfire before a different car, the one carrying Cabrera, jumped 
the curb and crashed into a tree inches from a house. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew what the argument was about, but one man estimated he heard 20 
shots fired "back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept shooting and shooting," said a 12-year-old neighbor, who asked not 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 A group standing outside the single-family home where the party was held 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The sidewalk and street were sprinkled with shattered glass, and dozens of 
yellow police markings showed a trail of blood droplets extending a block down 
Adrin Way. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the block, residents gathered near the spot where Cabrera's car 
crashed. A stray bullet had smashed through the front window of a house near 
the stopped car and pierced a sofa, but no one inside was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who lives on the street where the battle occurred said residents are 
used to hearing occasional gunfire, but nothing that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard them, but it's never happened like last night," Guillermo Valle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the neighborhood of single-family homes is generally peaceful, 
although a man was shot dead a block away a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's calm when it wants to be calm," Cesar Garcia said. "When it's rowdy, 
it's something like this."

STATE ELECTIONS / LEGISLATURE; GOP INCUMBENTS TRY TO FEND OFF FEISTY CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL and ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the predictability of Republican conquests in Orange County's state 
legislative races are a few battles where feisty Democratic underdogs are at 
least making life interesting for the GOP incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notable are the 34th Senate and 68th Assembly District races. Each 
features a longtime City Council member -- Buena Park's Donna L. Chessen and 
Anaheim's Irv Pickler, respectively -- challenging well-financed Republicans, 
state Sen. Rob Hurtt and Assemblyman Curt Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indisputable marquee race in Orange County is the knock-down, drag-out 
contest in the 69th Assembly District. As Democrats and Republicans wage war 
for control of the Assembly, the brawling 69th has become one of the most 
closely watched legislative races in the state this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was set last spring when Democrat Tom Umberg announced he was 
vacating the seat to run for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Now voters in the heavily Latino, blue-collar district encompassing Santa Ana 
and parts of Anaheim and Garden Grove are watching two little-known candidates 
slug it out in a battle that could be a microcosm for politics this year 
nationwide: more vitriol than virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of fraud, of theft, of misrepresentation seem to ring out from both 
camps almost daily. But aides of Republican Jim Morrissey and Democrat Mike 
Metzler agree that no Assembly race is being watched more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the No. 1 targeted seat among the Democrats and the 
Republicans in the whole state Assembly delegation," said Mark Thompson, a 
political consultant working for the Morrissey campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are huge for both parties. Democrats want desperately to keep a 
toehold in Orange County, and Umberg's old district is the only state or 
federal office they possess in the GOP bastion. Republicans see the race as a 
way not only to secure another seat in Sacramento for their side, but to give 
the party 100% control of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey, a 64-year-old manufacturer from Anaheim who is anti-abortion and a 
proponent of Proposition 187, which would bar education and most social service 
benefits for illegal immigrants, was running well in early polls. His campaign 
attributes it to Morrissey's folksy style and diligence at walking precincts to 
meet the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already walked 72 of the 123 precincts in the district by myself," 
Morrissey said. "This is a working-class district and I'm a tool and die maker 
by trade and people can relate to that. I'm one of the few people running for 
office that has signed both sides of a paycheck, front and back." 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler's camp claims the Republicans gained early momentum by not only 
confusing the voters, but by lying to them. Angered that Morrissey was 
misrepresenting Metzler's stand supporting the "three strikes" anti-crime law, 
Metzler was forced to call a press conference recently to publicize his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morrissey's people seem to be going at our strengths, our strong stands 
against crime and for business, and trying to convince people they don't 
exist," said Rich Milner, a Metzler aide. "It's an interesting approach, but 
it's clearly very fraudulent." 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler, 46, the president of the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce for the past 
11 years, is an abortion rights advocate and an opponent of Proposition 187. 
But, after a bitter primary against two Latino challengers, he has little time 
left to get out and take advantage of the Democratic majority in the district, 
of his endorsement from Umberg and his many backers among local police 
organizations. 
</P>

 In the 34th Senate District, Chessen has demonstrated moxie just by taking on 
Hurtt, a wealthy manufacturer who has cut a wide swath in Sacramento with his 
conservative politics and willingness to finance his brand of candidates and 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democratic leaders, who make no secret of their dislike for Hurtt, have 
talked openly of funneling campaign money to Chessen in an effort to neutralize 
the Republican's spending or possibly even defeat him. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Chessen has been busy trying to portray Hurtt as a lawmaker more 
adept at funding campaigns and playing politics than taking care of the 
district, which sprawls across parts of Garden Grove, Buena Park, Santa Ana and 
Anaheim. She also criticizes him for missing key committee votes, supporting 
last year's unsuccessful school voucher initiative and his staunch opposition 
to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to be a kingmaker," said Chessen, a Buena Park councilwoman for 
the past nine years. "Where the rubber meets the road, he hasn't been there for 
the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt scoffs at such assessments. He contends Chessen is "stretching it a bit" 
on his missed votes and said he's only doing his job as the Senate Elections 
Committee chairman by traveling the state to help elect fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be surprised if abortion rights supporters and teachers attack him in 
the closing days of the campaign due to his stances on vouchers and abortion. 
"That doesn't go far," he said. "This is a working person's district. By far 
and away all my surveys show jobs is the biggest issue. So that's why we're 
saying, 'Hey, I'm the job guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the contest is Libertarian Thomas E. Reimer of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The race between Pringle and Pickler in the 68th Assembly District touches on 
many of the same themes.  
</P>
<P>
 Pringle, who has quickly risen to the No. 2 GOP post in the Assembly, has 
solid backing both logistically and financially from his party colleagues. He 
also is much more conservative than Pickler, a Boston native who contends 
Pringle is too ideologically rigid to accomplish much in Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 Pickler is making much of Pringle's acceptance -- along with nearly all other 
state lawmakers -- of a recent wage increase approved by an independent salary 
commission. He says he would give the money instead to charity. He also 
criticizes Pringle for votes against restricting assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In running a mostly upbeat campaign in a district that includes parts of 
Garden Grove, Westminster, Anaheim and Buena Park, Pringle has underlined his 
support for the "three-strikes" measure and Proposition 187, as well as his 
work to improve the business climate and economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm pretty much in sync with the people in this district," Pringle 
said. "But I don't take any race for granted." 
</P>
<P>

 In the 38th Senate District, which stretches from South County down through 
northern San Diego County, Republican William A. (Bill) Craven of Oceanside is 
an overwhelming favorite to win his fifth straight -- and his last -- four-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven, a former San Diego County supervisor who has spent more than 30 years 
in public life, is best known for helping establish Cal State San Marcos in the 
district and for his work on the railroad corridor between Los Angeles and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic opponent, Thomas Berry of Laguna Hills, said he has been 
winning over Republican voters with such issues as his proposal to make the San 
Onofre nuclear plant a water desalination facility. "I don't seek to replace a 
Republican as much as I'm replacing an incumbent who has lost touch with the 
voters," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian candidate August Anderson of Encinitas and Peace and Freedom Party 
candidate Mary Ann Nikl of Carlsbad round out the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The other race this November for a vacant seat is in the 70th Assembly 
District, which is heavily Republican and includes Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, 
Irvine and parts of Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, Lake Forest and Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn C. Brewer, a former aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, emerged the 
winner in June in the Republican primary and remains the heavy favorite to take 
over the seat Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) is vacating to run for 
the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Her opponent is Democrat Jim Toledano of Costa Mesa, an attorney and former 
University of California regent. Toledano, 50, is a different kind of Democrat 
who, as a young Republican, worked on former Sen. Barry Goldwater's national 
presidential campaign. Now he's hoping to pull off an upset with the help of 
publicity on his lawsuit against the plan to turn Newport Coast Drive into a 
toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 71st Assembly District, the most Republican seat in the state, Democrat 
Jeanne Costales faces long odds. Even though Assemblyman Mickey Conroy may have 
been sued by a former employee and reprimanded by the Rules Committee in August 
for sexual harassment, the Republican lawmaker enjoys such a huge voter 
registration advantage that he has hardly had to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Costales still believes she can win and has been walking precincts with the 
help of a campaign staff that features more Republicans than Democrats. A 
former school board member in her native Ohio, Costales contends she would 
bring to the post integrity that Conroy lacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, however, made a name for himself throughout the country this year when 
he sponsored a bill calling for paddling of juvenile graffiti vandals. The 
harassment charges will put to test his personal popularity in the district, 
which includes Tustin, Orange, Villa Park and Lake Forest. Conroy's chief of 
staff, Pete Conaty, argues that "the voters do not believe these charges, and 
this election will prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic underdog in the 72nd Assembly District has no illusions about 
his chances for victory. Allan L. Dollison, a third-year law student and a 
first lieutenant in the California National Guard, said he is running for the 
seat simply because no other Democrat would take on incumbent Republican Ross 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollison's prime issue: He would save the voters $100,000. That's the cost of 
a special election that would be needed if Johnson wins the special election 
early next year to replace state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach).  
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot in the district, which includes Fullerton, Yorba Linda and 
Placentia, is Libertarian Geoffrey Braun of Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 67th Assembly District, which covers Huntington Beach and several 
surrounding cities, 10-year Republican incumbent Doris Allen is expected to 
have few problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The real question in this race remains whether Allen plans to abandon the post 
and run against Johnson and Ferguson for Bergeson's Senate seat. She has 
admitted to strongly considering the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic candidate Jonathan Woolfe-Willis says he is "realistic" about his 
chances of defeating Allen, in view of the 51% to 35% registration advantage 
for the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a shot at it, although I think it would be fair to say it's a long 
shot," said Woolfe-Willis, a homeowners association attorney who is also 
treasurer of the Democratic Foundation of Orange County. Like Dollison in the 
72nd district race, he is making an issue of Allen's plans to possibly abandon 
the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the 73rd Assembly District, which includes much of South County, 
is a rematch of the 1992 contest, when Republican Bill Morrow of Oceanside 
walloped Democrat Lee Walker of Laguna Niguel by 21,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real difference this November is that Morrow, a stalwart 
conservative, is an incumbent. Walker, a longtime English professor at 
Saddleback College, said he offers voters a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running are Libertarian B. Wade Hostler of Oceanside and Carlsbad's 
Tonatiuh Rodriguez-Nikl, the Peace & Freedom candidate.

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY DELAYS LIFEGUARD FUNDS VOTE 
</P>

<P>
 Faced with a county plan to pull the plug on subsidies for lifeguard services, 
the City Council has postponed a vote on accepting reduced funding in the hope 
of getting the county to change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County began paying the subsidies to Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, 
Laguna Beach, Seal Beach and San Clemente years ago, when there were no 
county-operated beaches. At the time, the cities were smaller and had less 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, the total county contribution to all beach operations in the 
cities has been $248,248, with $110,420 going to Newport Beach under a formula 
that divides the money according to how much each city spends on lifeguard 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the county notified the five cities that it planned to phase out the 
subsidy because of state budget cuts. The phase-out was to end county funding 
by the 1997-98 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin Murphy warned in a report to the council that the county 
could abruptly cut off funding for cities that refuse a 25% per year reduction 
over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Laguna Beach and Seal Beach have voted to approve the phase-out, 
Murphy asked the council to postpone a vote until after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are optimistic that Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) will 
be elected to the Board of Supervisors and may be able to secure continued 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Phil Sansone opposed the cut outright. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bothers me, in that (lifeguard services) are costing the city $2 million 
a year. What bothers me more is that there is no justification other than that 
the state has taken away money from the county," he said. "I kind of think that 
they are trying to lay onto the city something they shouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials apparently have similar feelings and postponed 
their vote on the matter earlier this month to explore legal alternatives to 
accepting the cut. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; NEIGHBORS SUE TO HALT WAREHOUSE PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new citizens' organization has filed a Superior Court lawsuit in an effort 
to halt construction of a proposed warehouse near a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, Citizens' Assn. for the Sensible Development of Warland 
Center, is composed of about 100 residents who live near the Warland business 
center on Valley View Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a new 440,000-square-foot warehouse proposed for 11400 Valley View 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be used as a wholesale distribution center for Shaw Industries, a 
Georgia-based carpet maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby homeowners pleaded in vain with the council Sept. 26 to reject the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that the warehouse operation would lower property values because 
of increased traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said the project would have little environmental impact 
and would bring the city millions of dollars in new sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners returned to the council's Oct. 10 meeting to ask for 
reconsideration and answers to various questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Partin cut off their testimony after about 40 minutes, noting 
that the matter was not on the council's agenda for that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to withdraw the decision," Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age said 
at the Oct. 10 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan Smith, a member of the citizens' group, said the lawsuit includes a 
request for an injunction against construction of the warehouse "until there is 
an updated EIR (environmental impact report) on the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said residents of the warehouse area believe they have been badly 
treated by the City Council. "We feel the city absolutely forced us into this 
lawsuit," she said. BILL BILLITER

<P>
 The city Planning Commission has approved a zoning change that will allow 
restaurants in the Pacific Commercenter business park. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan approved last week, the 824,000-square-foot business park, 
located at Bake Parkway and Trabuco Road, would be allowed 20,000 square feet 
for restaurant use.The proposed zone change will go to the City Council for 
final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was part of a deal between Los Alisos Development Co. and the 
city that reduced the amount of space in the business park dedicated to 
businesses that attract traffic, such as health clubs, banks and travel 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners said the 20,000 square feet of restaurant space would 
accommodate one sit-down dining establishment and as many as two drive-through, 
fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will not modify any essential conditions under which the Pacific 
Commercenter was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The modification drew few complaints from three neighboring homeowners' 
associations. City planners did agree to hold additional public hearings when 
specific plans for the restaurants are turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 Several conditions were imposed to ease the project's impact on neighboring 
homeowners, including restrictions on when trash can be collected and a 
requirement for at least a 190-foot setback from any residential dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic study commissioned by Los Alisos Development Co. concluded that the 
restaurants would not significantly increase traffic in the area. City staff 
reviewed the study and agreed with its conclusions. FRANK MESSINA

 A band of Newport Heights residents clapped and cheered last week as the City 
Council unanimously voted to spend $175,000 for a long-awaited neighborhood 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been lobbying city officials for Bolsa Park for seven years.The 
vote means they should have it by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-acre park will be built on a section of Bolsa Avenue between between 
Old Newport Boulevard and Broad Street. The area is paved and still in use as a 
public street. The park will include a picnic table and a "tot lot" grassy play 
area for small children, benches and a water fountain, planner Scot Ferris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart was quick to move for approval of the 
mini-park, which is in her district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow this long-awaited project to move forward . . . concurrently 
as the General Plan (revision) moves forward," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also approved was priority status for a plan to acquire a property next to 
Begonia Park in Corona del Mar. HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 The City Council has taken a step toward building a library by awarding a 
contract that could pay up to $60,000 to an architectural firm for design work. 
</P>
<P>
 From 29 proposals sent to the city, council members last week chose 
Irvine-based LPA Inc. to do the work and called it one of the toughest choices 
in front of the council in a long while. 
</P>
<P>
 LPA Inc. and the other finalist, Hardy, Holzman, Pfeiffer Associates, unveiled 
their proposals in extended presentations before the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't an easy decision," Councilwoman Sharon Cody said. "Both of their 
presentations were extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 The council chose LPA Inc. on a 4-0 vote. Mayor Susan Withrow withdrew from 
discussions and voting on the contract because of complaints over her 
participation in library fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to avoid even the appearance of impropriety," said Withrow, who is 
running for reelection. Other candidates had objected to her appearance in 
advertisements promoting the library plans, saying it amounted to receiving a 
political donation.  
</P>
<P>
 Cody said she voted for LPA Inc. because the city has worked with the 
architectural firm in the past. LPA Inc. was hired in 1991 to create a design 
for an 80,000-square-foot City Hall, which was ultimately rejected by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council candidates voiced objections to the selection of LPA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Gilbert and Karen Irvine said choosing an architect for the library 
was an important decision that should be left to the council that will take 
office in November. FRANK MESSINA

HIKE

<P>
 About 40 merchants packed a City Council study session last week, angry over a 
recent fee increase to park in the downtown parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some even had to close their doors to get to the meeting -- that's how 
important they feel this is," said Stephen C. Daniel, president of the Downtown 
Business Assn. and owner of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel said merchants are upset they were not involved in the process before 
the fee hike was imposed by the council Oct. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 He said merchants fear higher fees will discourage customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody understands (the city) has to raise revenues. But we take the brunt 
of this downtown," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told the crowd that the effective date 
of the increase will be delayed. It was scheduled to take effect Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and merchants are expected to present alternatives discussed 
last week to the council Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to come up with a fee schedule and operational plan that's fair to 
businesses and won't kill businesses, and at the same time make the parking 
structure self-supporting," said Community Services Director Ron Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had increased fees by $1 to $3 on weekdays and $4 on weekends. 
Business owners will continue to be charged 25 cents for each validation, but 
the public will now pay $1 for parking with one validation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, parking was free with the validation. DEBRA CANO

COMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; OCTA AID IS SOUGHT TO HELP TRAFFIC FLOW 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are asking for about $575,000 from the Orange County 
Transportation Authority to pay for four proposed projects intended to increase 
traffic flow on some of the city's busiest streets. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the proposed projects, approved by the City Council this week, is the 
widening of Los Alamitos Boulevard at Katella Avenue, one of the most congested 
city intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Rollinger, the city's public services director and engineer, said the 
city is seeking $67,000 to be used for engineering designs to widen the 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic flow is still adequate during peak hours, but the intersection would 
be severely congested in 15 years unless it is widened, Rollinger said.  
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the project is estimated at $450,000, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The widening plan is separate from the proposed Katella "smart street" 
project, which would also involve improvements to the intersection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can work together," Rollinger said. "We'll make sure that whatever we do 
now, won't be undone later." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have requested $400,000 for traffic light improvements along 
Ball Road from Bloomfield Street to Holder Street; $100,000 for the widening of 
the Cerritos Avenue/Los Alamitos Boulevard intersection, and $10,000 for 
improvements on the Katella Avenue/Bloomfield intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinger said he expects OCTA to respond to the request "in the next few 
months." BERT ELJERA

 State law requires cities to reduce solid waste by 25% by 1995. The Villa Park 
report showed that the city is already diverting, or recycling for other use, 
27% of its daily trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's garbage collection contract is with Taormina Industries of Anaheim. 
That firm has a facility in Anaheim that sorts waste and recovers usable 
products, such as cardboard, paper and metals. The Taormina facility currently 
recycles an average of 7.4 tons of the daily trash output of Villa Park, 
according to the City Council's report. 
</P>
<P>
 The council received the trash-analysis report during a public hearing last 
week on the city's plans for solid-waste recovery. No residents showed up to 
testify on the matter, and the council, after brief discussion, unanimously 
approved its report to the state. BILL BILLITER

 You won't see physical fitness instructor Leonard Johnson barking out commands 
like a drill sergeant or doling out punishment in the form of pushups. His 
philosophy is that exercise should be fun, and that teamwork and good 
sportsmanship are more important than box scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by how his students at Heritage Oak Private Elementary and Preschool 
(H.O.P.E.) performed on the President's Challenge fitness test last spring, his 
approach is yielding dramatic results. 
</P>
<P>
 The children reacted with wild applause at an assembly Friday when they 
learned that H.O.P.E. placed first in the state and second in the country for 
schools of its size in the nationally certified program.  
</P>
<P>
 Slightly more than 68% of H.O.P.E.'s students who took the test (82 out of 
120) earned Presidential Physical Fitness Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very, very excited," said the school's executive director, Phyllis 
Cygan, who credits Johnson for pumping up the P.E. program. 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnson came to H.O.P.E. six years ago, only 19% of the students passed 
the fitness exam, which consists of a one-mile run/walk, sit-ups, a sitting 
stretch, pull-ups and a shuttle run. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the sharp turnaround occurred because he gives students lots of 
individual attention, tracks their progress on a computer and motivates them to 
work hard by presenting exercise as an enjoyable activity.  
</P>
<P>
 "I disguise the exercise through games," he said. "I don't want them to feel 
exercise is a negative thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim resident also leads by example. "When I ask them to do something, 
I do it," he said, be it kicking soccer balls with the preschoolers or playing 
limited-contact football with the older children. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead to the fitness testing next spring, Johnson is hoping his 
students post even higher scores. Winning the national championship would be 
nice, he said, but not the real priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the children are learning and enjoying themselves," he said, 
"that's more important than winning a patch or a trophy." ALAN EYERLY

 Jim Silva has collected more money and enters the final days of the campaign 
with a larger war chest than Linda Moulton Patterson in the hard-fought Second 
District supervisor's race, finance statements revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva has raised $251,340, compared with $211,829 for Moulton 
Patterson.Silva's ending cash balance was $30,494 on Oct. 22, the last day 
covered in the most recent finance statements. Moulton Patterson's ending 
balance was $12,419. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past month, Silva collected $56,662 and spent $50,699 on such items 
as mailers and fund-raising events.  
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, Moulton Patterson collected $37,187 and spent $34,612 
on such items as mailers and signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is considered one of the hottest on the local ballot. The latest 
flare-up in the campaign came last week when Moulton Patterson -- the mayor of 
Huntington Beach -- unveiled a plan to reform county government. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would slash the supervisors' budgets by 15%, eliminate their 
county-provided cars and begin performance audits of every department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, if the voters like the direction the county is going, they will 
vote for Jim Silva," she said in a statement. "If they want to change 
direction, they should vote for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva supporters dismissed her plan as a "transparent" effort to capture 
attention. Silva, a Huntington Beach councilman, could not be reached for 
comment. SHELBY GRAD

<P>
 Local government and business officials met with civic leaders from 53 cities 
without leaving the city during a teleconference designed to share ideas on 
addressing social and economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen representatives from cities and corporations throughout the 
county participated in the event last week.The program linked them with peers 
thousands of miles away, said Debra Walters, spokeswoman for the Volunteer 
Center, which organized the event locally. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 90-minute program, they used satellite telecommunications and video 
equipment to offer each other tips on community problem-solving and traded 
suggestions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two years, as many as 500 groups nationwide will be able to 
participate, creating a kind of national convention via cyberspace, said Janet 
Whitcomb, executive vice president of Volunteer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it will be extremely valuable. It would, in some ways, be able 
to compensate that people cannot physically get together. It would allow that 
kind of networking and interaction on an intimate basis for virtually no cost," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics discussed included ways to boost community service and reduce 
unemployment and crime. The discussion was run primarily through the 
Washington, D.C.-based Civic Television Network. People at each site responded 
to questions in turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said that because the event was the first of its kind, the discussion 
was essentially one-sided and was led from the group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Future programs will offer groups more freedom in shaping the discussion. The 
next conference will be Wednesday.

 The Political Action Committee of the Fullerton Police Officer's Assn. has 
announced its endorsement of two City Council candidates in the Nov. 8 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Danny Becerra said the committee chose to endorse Councilwoman Jan M. 
Flory and former Councilman Don Bankhead, who recently was forced to leave 
office after a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee had sent out a questionnaire to all candidates and interviewed 
the few who responded, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basis for our endorsement is we felt (Bankhead and Flory) best represent 
the interests of the Police Department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead, 62, is a retired police captain who worked for the Fullerton Police 
Department for more than 31 years. Flory, 50, is an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates still in the race are: Jack Dean, 46; incumbent Conrad 
Dewitte, 46; Bob McNutt, 50; Michael J. Mummert, 35; Gary Nouskajian, 43; Edith 
O'Donnell, 65; Stuart Stitch, 25; James J. Tanaka, 37, and Carole E. Wink, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Logemann, Leland C. Wilson, Bahia E. Wilson and Michael J. Wagner have 
withdrawn from the race. MIMI KO

 In his second term, Councilman Tony Lam appears to have mastered the key to 
American politics: building a war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Vietnamese American to win an elective office in the nation, Lam has 
become a prolific political fund-raiser, according to the latest campaign 
statements provided by the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 From July 1 to Sept. 30, Lam raised more than $25,000, far outstripping the 
combined amount raised by the other candidates for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Craig Schweisinger reported raising $1,840, mostly through loans 
from himself and his wife, Carolyn. Margie L. Rice, the other council 
candidate, lent her campaign committee $800 to pay for the candidate's 
statement printed on the election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Charles V. Smith, who is unopposed, did not report any campaign 
contributions, but listed $1,336 in expenses, including $800 for the campaign 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam, who won a two-year term in 1992, has received contributions from 
individuals and companies both in and outside Westminster, according to his 
40-page campaign statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Na Vann Pung, owner of the Chi-Mengs Chinese Acupuncture Clinic in Garden 
Grove, contributed $1,000; the Westminster Car Wash in Los Angeles, $900; and 
the Westminster Municipal Employees Assn., $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who contributed $100 were Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. and 
Police Chief James Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got contributions from people of all walks of life," Lam said. "They 
support me because they believe in what I've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam, Schweisinger and Rice are vying for the two open seats on the five-member 
council in the Nov. 8 election. BERT ELJERA

LOCAL ELECTIONS / GARDEN GROVE CITY COUNCIL; CANDIDATES IN CROWDED RACES ARE 
LINKED BY PRO-BUSINESS SLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sights along Garden Grove Boulevard offer hints why the five candidates 
for mayor and the 12 aspiring for City Council seats in the Nov. 8 election 
have declared themselves pro-business. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's major thoroughfare is littered with the scars of a struggling local 
economy: boarded up storefronts, signs advertising vacant office buildings and 
chain-link fences around empty, weed-choked lots. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some bright spots. On Main Street, across from a patch of vacant 
land, stands the newly opened Costco, the largest store of the national chain, 
built in part with redevelopment money. 
</P>
<P>
 With its palm trees and manicured lawns, Costco is the first of several 
projects that city officials hope will revive the downtown area and bring new 
tax dollars into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the strip malls on the east side to the Korean shops on the west end, 
there are telltale signs that businesses along the city's two-mile stretch of 
Garden Grove Boulevard are still hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the first order of business, say candidates, is to revive the local 
economy. Immediately. Otherwise, public services could be jeopardized, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 This fiscal year, city officials covered a $7 million deficit through a 
variety of cuts, including not filling 11 positions in the Police Department, 
in order to balance the $46.5-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are projecting another $7 million deficit for fiscal year 
1995-96, with income estimated at $40.8 million and expenses at $47.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the council rejected a proposal to open a card club as an anchor of 
a theme park, but two candidates for mayor -- Al N. Snook and Kelly A. Sherwood 
-- said the idea should not be dismissed outright. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it up to the public for a vote," said Snook, 59, an insurance broker. "It 
could bring in from $15 million to $20 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood, 28, an engineering assistant, said that he favors a card club as 
part of a family-oriented theme park in the mold of the "new" Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The other mayoral candidates -- Councilman Ho Chung, Councilman Bruce A. 
Broadwater and Bart E. Blakesley -- said they are against a card club or casino 
opening in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung, 60, an insurance agent, said that he would like to see an international 
trade center as an anchor of a theme park built to complement the proposed 
expansion of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadwater, 55, who works for the state Department of Insurance, said he also 
favors a theme park that would offer family-oriented recreation and an ice 
skating rink that could be home to a minor league hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakesley, 53, a supervising engineer with the Los Angeles Metro Rail Design 
team, said he supports building a high-tech rail system along Harbor Boulevard 
with the project funded in part with federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung and Broadwater said the theme park could be developed with redevelopment 
money and private investors, but Blakesley said he would favor using 
redevelopment funds, with matching funds from other public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A Seal Beach company, U.S. Entertainment Inc., is studying whether a theme 
park in Garden Grove would be feasible with Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm 
just a few miles away. The council agreed to spend $17,000 for the study, which 
is expected to be completed before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for the two-year mayor's seat is considered wide open. Mayor Frank 
Kessler decided not to seek reelection after one term. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler, 61, a former Garden Grove police chief and councilman, said that he 
was frustrated by the in-fighting among council members, which was exacerbated 
when four of them decided to run in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Chung and Broadwater running for mayor, Mark Leyes and Robert 
F. Dinsen, are running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said he also was bitter with the council decision last year to pull 
out of the League of California Cities, which he said has isolated the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He has endorsed Blakesley, a former member of the Planning Commission, for 
mayor, although he was widely expected to support Chung, an ally on the 
council. The mayor said Chung would remain on the council anyway for the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, elected citywide, holds a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowded race for two open seats on the council, the candidates include 
the 77-year-old Dinsen, who has been on the council since 1980, and 25-year-old 
Jose Luis Moreno Jr., a political science student at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Four said they will bring business experience to the council: Pam Harris, 27, 
business owner; Martha Anderson-Monroe, 54, business owner; Richard R. Rahder, 
49, an accountant and mortgage broker, and Frank Hoffman, 45, a lawyer and 
realtor.  
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are Fortunato Mabutas, 57, a realtor and teacher of 
English as a second language; Kenneth W. Maddox, 30, a Tustin police officer; 
Jeff Robinson, 27, a marketing associate of a publishing company, and John M. 
Parent, 38, purchasing manager of an aircraft company. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running are Leyes, who is seeking a second term, and Tony Ingegneri, an 
advertising executive and member of the Planning Commission. Leyes and 
Ingegneri, both 36, have been endorsed by the Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent forum sponsored by the Garden Grove Chamber of Commerce, the 
council candidates agreed that the only way out of the city's financial 
difficulties is to bring in more tax dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 They said the city must be more business-friendly, charge lower fees, 
encourage people to buy in Garden Grove and promote a better city image. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step, some candidates said, is to stop the bickering among council 
members, who are often perceived to be more interested in running for higher 
office than doing their work on the council.

PEPPERDINE'S O.C. CAMPUS DAMAGED IN BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arson investigators and business people spent Sunday picking through the 
charred wreckage of a commercial building that houses Pepperdine University's 
Orange County campus and several other offices, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive $2-million fire destroyed about half of the 15-year-old, 
90,000-square-foot building at 2125 Michelson Drive. It was discovered at 10:37 
p.m. Saturday by a passing shuttle bus driver from the nearby Irvine Holiday 
Inn, said Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County Fire Department. Some of the 
rest of the building was still usable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the building been modernized with up-to-date sprinkler systems or smoke 
detectors, the damage might have been less, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the biggest fire we've had this year. . . . The fire burned 
virtually half of the building, a huge commercial structure, and was literally 
wrapping around the courtyard," Young said. "Our problem was that it was built 
so long ago, it didn't have any protection systems." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, but it took 127 firefighters 90 minutes to control the 
blaze that was billowing out of windows of the two-story structure by the time 
firetrucks arrived, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took another six hours to extinguish the blaze, and the wreckage was still 
smoldering and hot Sunday morning, Young said. Fire officials estimated the 
damage at more than $2 million to about 40,000 square feet of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the age of the building, there was no requirement that it be 
equipped with smoke detectors or interior sprinkler systems. Ironically, the 
building had been purchased in April and the new owners have been "working for 
the past few weeks to get a design for a fire protection system," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A smoke detector or anything else that's monitored would have limited the 
damage," Young said. "If it would have had sprinklers, when we got there it 
would have probably been only a maintenance concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but officials, who first 
strongly suspected arson, are now not so sure, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first investigators were suspicious because (the fire started) in an 
unoccupied commercial building in the middle of the night. But now we are 
leaning toward something related to one of two suites being renovated," Young 
said, adding that it could be tied to unfinished painting or woodworking. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the "deepest char," an area where the fire had burned the hottest 
and longest, was found in the two suites on the north side of the building. The 
fire spread to four or five offices before it moved up to the second floor, 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for excessive smoke damage, the open classrooms of the Pepperdine 
University adjunct campus -- the building's largest occupant -- escaped major 
damage, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damaged businesses included 12 to 15 offices for a psychiatrist and firms 
doing marketing, public relations, mortgage loans and escrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of Pepperdine was spared. . . . They could possibly have 
classes Monday morning," Young said.

DISNEYLAND WORKERS RATIFY NEW CONTRACT, AVERTING STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of cashiers, cooks and other culinary workers at Disneyland voted 
overwhelmingly Sunday to ratify a new labor contract, lifting the threat of an 
impending strike that had loomed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 681 said that 98% 
of nearly 500 members voted for a three-year pact that gives them greater job 
security but smaller wage increases than the union had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote capped two months of negotiations between Disneyland and Local 681 
that culminated in a last-minute tentative agreement late Saturday, after the 
two sides had broken off talks at 4 that morning. The new agreement, covering 
about 1,600 food-service workers at the Anaheim amusement park, will replace a 
three-year contract that expires today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought hard for what we got," said Sandi Ecklund, who sells popcorn, ice 
cream and balloons at Disneyland. Ecklund was one of 18 members on the union's 
bargaining committee, which ironed out the agreement and unanimously 
recommended its passage to members. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland officials were not available for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new pact gives workers a 3% wage increase annually -- enough to keep pace 
with current inflation. That compared with a 4% annual raise in the last 
contract, signed in 1991.

<P>
 Although union members had hoped to maintain the 4% wage increase, they said 
they were not overly disappointed with what they got either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's probably the best we could have got for the way the economy is 
today," said Gerald Lueders, who works in the kitchen at Disneyland's New 
Orleans restaurant. "It's enough that we could live on it," he said after 
casting his ballot Sunday at the Grand Hotel, across the street from 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lueders and other union workers said they voted for the contract largely 
because of the outcome on two issues that they considered as important as 
wages: a proposal by the company to set up a two-tier wage structure and a push 
by the union to prohibit management from subcontracting jobs to non-union 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences on those two issues emerged from the start of the talks and 
threatened to result in the first strike at Disneyland in 10 years. Those 
issues were unresolved at 4 a.m. Saturday when the two sides, weary from 
meeting throughout the night, called off talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Working under a Sunday morning deadline, negotiators for the union and the 
company reconvened Saturday afternoon in an office behind Main Street in 
Disneyland, and the two sides reached a compromise at 10:30 that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland originally had sought to cap wages for most employees hired after 
Nov. 1 at $7.50 an hour, versus a top rate of $8.95 for most current workers. 
In the end, negotiators agreed that new hires would have the same top scale but 
that it would take them four years -- twice as long as former employees -- to 
reach $8.95 an hour, which will go up 27 cents on Tuesday under the new 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The second issue involved Local 681's effort to obtain language that would 
prevent Disneyland from subcontracting out any union jobs. The two sides agreed 
that Disneyland would limit subcontracting to no more than 10% of the jobs held 
by Local 681 members.

SANTA ANA'S SCHOOL YEAR IS SHORT BY 2,200 MINUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might not seem that way to intermediate school students, but the school day 
is too short. So now, district officials are scrambling to find a way to 
lengthen it before the year ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors who recently completed an annual review of the district's performance 
interpreted an obscure state educational code as requiring schools to offer 
about 3,200 more minutes of instruction each year than the district currently 
provides, district spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a checklist provided by the state, auditors focused on the length of 
instruction this year and found the discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
 While district schools have offered about 55,000 minutes of instruction each 
year -- more than the amount usually required by schools statewide -- they 
should provide 57,200 minutes, which is 2,200 minutes or close to 37 hours 
more. The higher figure is based on amount of instructional time the district 
offered in 1982-83, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Board of Education is now studying how to lengthen the 
intermediate school day without unduly disrupting students' and teachers' 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting on Tuesday night, the board studied three proposals to 
add the required minutes. However, after staff and parents pleaded for further 
consultations with them at school sites, the board opted to postpone its 
decision until Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials recommended that the board reinstate the seventh period, 
which was lost to budget cuts. But officials noted that doing so in the middle 
of the year would force every student and teacher to adjust to a new schedule. 
Other options include extending the length of every class a few minutes or 
tacking on a study or reading "mini-period" to each day's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes must be put into use by Jan. 3 for year-round schools and by Feb. 
6 for the other schools to ensure the district meets its requirements, Thomas 
said. JON NALICK

FIRE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER GETS NEW QUARTERS, EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new North Net Fire Communications Center, which serves the cities of 
Anaheim, Fullerton, Garden Grove and Orange, was formally unveiled during a 
ceremony last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, flanked by city council members and fire officials 
from the four cities, cut a ribbon at the new facility, located on the third 
floor of Anaheim City Hall West, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatch center features state-of-the-art equipment that will shave 
seconds off emergency response times by receiving and transmitting calls at a 
faster rate, said Jean Ferrell, the center's communications manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our old system was 10 years old," Ferrell said. "This one is much larger and 
faster. It also has an automatic backup system." 
</P>
<P>
 The system is also capable of storing a great deal more data, Ferrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatch center was formerly located in the basement of a fire training 
center in Orange, near Anaheim Stadium. The old building, where dispatchers 
made 52,000 calls in 1993, was in a flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scared me to death that we had the communications center for north Orange 
County operating in a building below grade in the Santa Ana River," Anaheim 
Fire Chief Jeffrey Bowman said. "It is now in a very secure facility." 
</P>
<P>
 A $1.6-million overhaul included buying the new equipment and moving the 
center to its new location, which is also the new administrative headquarters 
for the Anaheim Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I literally had people scattered all around the city," Bowman said. "It's 
more efficient to try and manage an agency where everyone is in the same 
place." GREG HERNANDEZ

SANTA ANA YOUTH DIES OF SHOT IN NECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager was fatally shot in the neck outside a Santa Ana apartment complex 
early Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federico Ceja Ibarra, 18, was found at 1:48 a.m. lying in front of an 
apartment on South Standard Ave., Santa Ana Police Sgt. Brian Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shooting was the result of some kind of fracas inside the apartment," 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Collins, someone called police and said a man had come into an 
apartment with a rifle and shot another man in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 But when police arrived, they found Ibarra, who lived on the same street as 
the complex, with a gunshot in the neck, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Because witnesses said Ibarra was associated with a local gang, the shooting 
is being investigated by the Police Department's gang detail, Collins said.

19 DRIVERS ARRESTED AT SOBRIETY CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen people spent the night in Laguna Beach's city jail after being 
stopped late Saturday and early Sunday at a field sobriety checkpoint and 
arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,300 motorists passed through the checkpoint set up on eastbound lanes 
of the 20000 block of Laguna Canyon Road between 10 p.m. Saturday and 2:30 a.m. 
Sunday, said Sgt. Mike Hall of the Laguna Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,084 motorists were stopped, questioned and given an informational 
brochure and 38 of them were given a field sobriety test, Hall said. Of the 19 
drivers who failed the test and were arrested, 14 were men and five were women, 
Hall said.

 The first of the season's economic forecasts for Orange County was delivered 
Friday at Cal State Fullerton. This, the third such report by the university's 
Institute for Economic and Environmental Studies, was pessimistic about Orange 
County's economic recovery. On a statewide level, signals are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 State employment officials said they underestimated job growth in California 
and that there may have been 200,000 more jobs than originally thought to have 
been created between March, 1993, and March, 1994. Here in Orange County, 
recent announcements of layoffs at Hughes Aircraft Co. in Fullerton and at AST 
Research Inc.'s manufacturing plant in Fountain Valley continue to have 
businesses worried that a local recovery may be lagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Meyer, managing partner of the Newport Beach office of accounting and 
consulting firm Kenneth Leventhal & Co., says the lingering recession in 
California has made businesses anxious to want to understand what is happening 
in the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the increased interest and the numerous signals sent by the various 
economic reports, analyzing the forecasts made by Cal State Fullerton, UCLA, UC 
Irvine and Chapman University has become an even more important part of the 
work Kenneth Leventhal's consultants do. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Meyer discusses the growing importance of these economic 
forecasts and how his consulting group uses them to advise clients on doing 
business in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why have these regional economic forecasts become so important? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Every one of our clients, more than in any time in history, is 
interested in what is going on in the economy because we have seen three or 
four years of a severe recession. Businesses in California had always felt that 
when there were downturns it was temporary, and now they are very concerned 
about trying to understand what will be happening. And it is our job to have a 
good knowledge base and have good advice to give. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which of the economic forecasts about the local economy do you use? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We look at all of them, including the Chapman, UCLA, UCI and Cal State 
Fullerton studies. Chapman has been doing its economic study and projection of 
the Orange County economy longer than Cal State Fullerton and has a reasonably 
good track record at predicting, so we tend to rely on the Chapman study for 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA forecast is important even though it has no specific Orange County 
data. But it has a 40-year track record, so it also is a reliable source and it 
is well-respected. And whenever we try to find historical trends to predict the 
future we start with the national and state economy, both of which have an 
impact on the Orange County economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In UCLA's last report, what I found most interesting was the fact that it was 
studying the revised employment data from the Employment Development Department 
and therefore revising its own analysis, which basically concluded that 
California had come out of the recession 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And to me that type of data and that understanding of the cycles, where (it 
appears) we had been forming a foundation for the past 18 months of future 
growth, then that helps to evaluate something like a Fullerton analysis, which 
says jobs are growing at a much slower rate than the EDD says. 
</P>
<P>
 I am skeptical of that type of an analysis (by Fullerton) because of what I 
read in the UCLA analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which indicators do you think are the most important? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The most important is job creation or loss. We are more focused on jobs 
than anything else. Job loss and job creation. A good deal of our client base 
is in real estate and there has been a fairly direct correlation between space 
occupied in offices, industrial buildings and in-house purchases and with job 
loss or creation. 
</P>
<P>
 All indicators are relevant. We are always concerned with consumer confidence 
-- that impacts home sales. It also impacts the health of all the businesses 
that are retail or that are creating consumer products. We are interested in 
personal and household income levels and household size. We are also very 
interested in population growth figures. There is not just one figure that is 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned consumer confidence. Do you look at the UCI consumer 
confidence survey? And do you find it to be accurate? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. That gives a close reading of attitudes in our back yard. And we think 
it is very meaningful and generally accurate. For example, in home purchases, 
consumer psychology is an extremely important element. For people to buy homes, 
they have to feel confident in their jobs and confident that the economy will 
be strong, so housing prices will be moving up. They tend to buy more homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which indicators are the least helpful to you and least important to your 
clients? 
</P>
<P>
 A: National Industrial Production may not be a real high one for us. I am sure 
there are a lot that are less relevant. We tend to look at the overall package 
and use the information to get ideas about the big trends and signs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do your clients care most about, state or local projections? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They are more interested in the local information. And then they are 
interested in more microeconomic analysis. For example, if they are thinking of 
investing in a retail center they will be more interested in knowing the trends 
of the population and income and demographics within a five- or 10-mile radius. 
If they are interested in land development, they'll want to know about the 
supply and demand of land in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there something that is missing in these forecasts that would be useful? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If any of them were broken out for the regions of the county, that would be 
beneficial. South County's economy is very different from North County. The 
(proposed) commercial, industrial development, occupancy and rental rates (for 
commercial properties) in different parts of the county are not reported on by 
the universities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very important to anybody in property ownership; every employer is 
occupying space and the more that is occupied is an indication of growth and 
employment -- and that means consumer purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do use the information in your own business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We use the forecasts to create our own forecast, and we spend a great deal 
of time and money on that. Walter Hahn, who is a Ph.D. (in economics), heads up 
that effort and we have a staff of analysts to comb through all the data. We 
forecast Orange County and the Inland areas. We also compile an overall 
economic report for the Urban Land Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 We never accept the data at face value. We analyze it and look at the genesis 
of the data. Compare it with other sources. Do our own market surveys. 
Fullerton had been reporting job losses in Orange County. Our judgment is that 
the area from the 55 Freeway south has been experiencing job gains and we feel 
it is probably true for the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you ever used the university forecasts to make decisions about your 
own business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, for example, our firm has expanded significantly into health care in 
Orange County and that is because we see that the health care business is one 
of the biggest expanding businesses in the country and here in Orange County as 
well. That is just one example of how a business uses these surveys to make a 
decision to move into a market or to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of advice do you give your clients based on the forecasts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We advise lenders and the people that are looking to restructure existing 
debt. Take for example, a retail center. We can predict how retail sales will 
be in the future, so it will know how strong its tenants will be, so it knows 
how much to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 And also we use this economic data for portfolio sales when banks or insurance 
companies are selling off large portfolios of properties and mortgages, and we 
evaluate the derived investment value by projecting into the future and 
projecting future rents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can the average business get out of such economic forecasts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The average business person gets confused because they get these things 
from so many different sources. My best advice is to look at trends over a 
one-year period and to look at information, such as the gross domestic product 
on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 But the information they need is more localized than just the county data. 
They need information on the neighborhood where they have their business or at 
least the part of the county. Unfortunately, there are not good statistics on 
neighborhoods or parts of the county available to the local business person to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 So I think their best bet is to join the local Chamber of Commerce, go to 
local meetings where people exchange information about how local businesses are 
doing.

COULD THIS BE END OF AN ERA FOR PUBLISHING HOUSE OF FARRAR, STRAUS?; BOOKS: 
AFTER NEARLY FIVE DECADES AS AN INDEPENDENT, THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO SELL A 
MAJORITY OF ITS STOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A soggy Florida rain had let up in time to move the lavish party out under the 
night sky. On that evening in May of 1993, booksellers, editors and their 
guests sipped and mingled in honor of Scott Turow, the best-selling 
lawyer/author of "Presumed Innocent" and the new "Pleading Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Turow accepted compliment after compliment for his nimble legal thrillers, but 
he was not the center of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his publisher and host, Roger Straus Sr., silver-haired and radiant 
in a tropical white ensemble, gathered party-goers and schmoozed like a jaunty 
showman. He boasted that he was about to add 100,000 copies to the 1 million of 
"Pleading Guilty" already in print. 
</P>
<P>
 In his heart, however, Straus may have been feeling guilty himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Turow's novels had been selling in numbers sturdy enough to cushion a 
lot of Farrar, Straus & Giroux's less commercial titles -- and to pay for the 
night's splash at the palatial Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables during the 
American Booksellers Assn. convention. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all of Straus' outward bonhomie, a new Turow novel was "not his kind 
of thing," to quote a colleague, and he apparently worried about the 
possibility that the writer's runaway bestsellers would give the independent 
Farrar, Straus a much too commercial image. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Straus' house was Nobel Prize house, the esteemed publisher of 
Isaac Bashevis Singer, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Joseph Brodsky, William Golding, 
Nadine Gordimer and Derek Walcott. 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher saw commercial fare as the province of other New York 
publishers, almost all of which have been acquired in recent years by large 
conglomerates and now sought out Big Books in keener appreciation of the bottom 
line than of literary luster. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half later, the publishing house that Straus built and guarded in 
Spartan confines on Union Square is about to follow the competitors he so often 
slammed with the salty expletives for which he is known. 
</P>
<P>
 In an all but inconceivable development, the 77-year-old man of letters is 
expected to announce today that the majority of Farrar, Straus stock will be 
sold to a larger corporation -- Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, a German 
concern that owns Henry Holt and Co., a New York book publisher also respected 
for its literary tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of an era? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Straus said Friday, "because I chose a purchaser that will 
preserve the integrity and uniqueness of Farrar, Straus. The company will 
remain independent and separate now and for the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreseeable future. Some industry observers say they expect few changes at 
Farrar, Straus. Yet others have been quick to recall that William Shawn became 
a consulting editor at the publishing house after the longtime autonomous 
editor of the New Yorker was ousted in 1987 by S.I. Newhouse Jr. -- the 
magazine's new owner who had expressed similar guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 And Straus, who said he will now become the sole minority stockholder in his 
company, "with equality on the board," added that he has no plans to retire and 
move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will have what I laughingly call 'a lifetime contract' with the company, 
and Jonathan Galassi will remain as editor in chief." 
</P>
<P>
 Straus battled cancer a decade ago and underwent surgery for an aneurysm a few 
years later, "but I'm in good health now as far as anyone can tell me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to do this sale sooner rather than later first of all to protect my 
authors, and also my staff and the stockholders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling one of New York's most distinguished publishing houses after nearly 
five decades as an independent entity will acknowledge not only Straus' 
advanced years but also unresolved philosophical differences between a father 
and his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Straus III -- who had left the company only to come back in 1985 as 
managing director and then leave again last year -- has been engaged as a 
photographer and a packager of books for other publishers. The elder Straus 
said he sought a buyer only after being assured by his son that he would not 
return to the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Straus III, now 50, "wanted to move faster than I felt we should," his 
father said last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger man had spearheaded expansion atop the enormous profits generated 
by Turow and one of his father's authors, Tom Wolfe, whose "The Bonfire of the 
Vanities" became one of the biggest books of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff tripled in size, to about 100 employees, and sales also tripled, to 
about $30 million a year. It was uneasy growth for Straus senior, who 
remembered that the bestseller-fueled expansion in the 1950s had nearly 
bankrupted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who worked alongside both men recalled that there was tension between 
the two. According to these sources, Straus senior favored Wolfe, Susan Sontag 
and other Farrar, Straus writers of their generation, while Roger III brought 
in new editors -- such as Galassi, who edits Turow -- to put the company more 
closely in line with popular tastes.

BURBANK DISPUTES REPORT OF SEGREGATION; MINORITIES: POLICE, FIRE DEPARTMENT 
CHIEFS SAY ACLU STATISTICS ARE OUTDATED AND DISCOUNT RECENT EFFORTS TO 
DIVERSIFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women and minorities in Burbank's police and fire departments are without 
question overwhelmingly outnumbered by white males. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether this should be called segregation is open for debate. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently completed report by the American Civil Liberties Union concluded 
that Burbank, as well as three other cities, have the "most segregated" police 
and firefighting forces in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those findings, however, are being hotly contested by the heads of Burbank's 
police and fire departments, who say that some of the statistics used by the 
ACLU are outdated and belie efforts in recent years to diversify their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the term segregated is ludicrous," Police Chief Dave Newsham said. 
"If you look in the dictionary under 'segregation,' it is a conscious effort to 
separate. We certainly don't do anything in anyone's wildest dreams that can be 
called segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burbank Police Department is a good place to work," Newsham said. "Some 
people stay 40 years. Are they (the ACLU) advocating we fire someone to 
maintain an artificial balance?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Police Department currently has only 10 sworn women officers in 
its 155-officer force. The department is 16% minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU report singled out the Burbank Police Department, saying it "is 
believed to be the only law enforcement agency in the region with 100 or more 
officers that totally excludes Asian-Pacific Islanders, who account for 5.7% of 
Burbank's population." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Newsham said, that statement in now inaccurate. There are currently three 
Asian officers on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Fire Department is 100% male. The 130-man force includes 14 
minorities. Six of the minority firefighters are new recruits who completed 
training in September, information that was not included in the ACLU report. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that the Fire Department has recently increased minority hiring, 
the report found "this supposedly diverse recruiting program included no women, 
no Asian-Pacific Islanders and only one African American." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU began to gather statistics on gender and race last May from 187 
Southland police and firefighting forces. Many of the departments were hesitant 
to release numbers, said ACLU spokesman Allan Parachini. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil rights group compared the numbers they collected to 1990 census 
figures and determined that gender, racial and ethnic balance in many 
departments did not adequately reflect community demographics. Compton, San 
Gabriel and Indio were singled out as the worst diversity offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsham and Burbank Fire Chief Michael Davis say it will take years before 
they are able to bring more women into their departments and to catch up with 
Burbank's changing racial and ethnic makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ACLU's Parachini argued that even recent gains do not go far enough. 
Segregation can occur subtly, he said, and police and fire chiefs throughout 
Southern California have had plenty of time to improve hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are changes that have been occurring 10, 15, 20 years," said Parachini, 
who oversaw the study. "It's not like the police and fire departments woke up 
yesterday and were confronted with huge increases in Asians and Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they are making strides in recruiting more women and minorities 
by posting job openings in minority publications and by sending representatives 
to job fairs in neighborhoods with heavily minority populations, such as 
Inglewood, Compton, Carson and East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The words and terms (the ACLU) used were inflammatory," said Lt. Chris 
Welker, the Burbank Police Department's highest-ranking woman. "I'm not sure 
what their hidden agenda was. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I resent them doing is saying everything we're doing is -- across the 
board -- wrong," Welker said. "I can't make a woman jump into this career." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has formed a Cultural Awareness Committee to train 
officers on diversity issues. In hopes of hiring women recruits, the Fire 
Department recently spent $1,400 on a specially designed ladder that is easier 
for women to carry. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the Burbank Human Relations Council, Marsha Ramos, praised the 
Police Department's recent efforts to meet face-to-face with a wide range of 
residents. But she declined to comment on the ACLU's findings until she could 
review them herself. ACLU Finds Segregation 
</P>
<P>
 A recently released study by American Civil Liberties Union concludes that 
Burbank's police and fire departments are one of the most segregated forces in 
Los Angeles County. The departments' chiefs contend that figures used by the 
ACLU are not up to date.

HAPPY HAUNTING; HALLOWEEN EVENTS HELP PROVIDE SAFE ATMOSPHERE FOR YOUNG SPOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tiny Power Rangers, wicked witches and ghoulish monsters were among the 7,500 
people who flocked to the fifth annual Halloween carnival Sunday at the Santa 
Clarita Sheriff's Station, one of dozens of organized events hosted by local 
cities and community organizations to celebrate the spooky holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although organized carnivals, haunted houses and trick-or-treating at shopping 
malls have become a popular -- and some say safer -- way to celebrate 
Halloween, others still believe there is no substitute for scouring a 
neighborhood for treats on Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a smaller town and we like to go to the community events," said Kim 
Doherty of Canyon Country, as her 3-year-old daughter, Rachel, dressed in a 
Minnie Mouse costume, tugged on her leg. "But we will still go 
trick-or-treating in our own neighborhood every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Doherty's three children were dressed in their Halloween costumes, including a 
Tweety Bird and a skeleton, to get into the swing of the holiday at the 
Sheriff's Department's carnival, which featured a haunted jailhouse, a 
"Dunk-a-Deputy" game, and a visit from the popular cartoon super heroes, the 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Shadow Ranch Recreation Center in West Hills, hundreds of visitors rode 
rides, ate hot dogs and enjoyed a relaxed day at the park's Halloween carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Tal Evenhain and her 4-month-old son, Cotan, who sat on the grass as the wind 
blew leaves from the many trees around them, said she would rather take her two 
sons to one of the local malls on Halloween night where there is enough light 
to see the children and candy is given out by department stores and specialty 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safer there," Evenhain said. "We live in Woodland Hills and I think it 
is still too dangerous to go out on the streets. At the mall, I can watch over 
them better." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Santa Clarita fair, the line snaked several yards for a chance to dunk 
Deputy John Bomben, already soaked to the bone in his uniform shirt Sunday 
afternoon. "Don't step over that line," he jeered at his potential dunkers. 
"Try closing your eyes -- it works better." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could say anything more, a little boy stepped up, gave the ball a 
fierce throw and hit the target bull's-eye, dunking the deputy and bringing a 
roar of laughter from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines also formed outside the haunted jailhouse. About a dozen inmates were 
transferred to cells at the local courthouse so the jail could be converted 
into a haunted house, which, a deputy said, was "rated 'S' for scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, a screaming teen-ager with a bowl of red-dyed spaghetti for a stomach 
was being "dismembered" by two crazy scientists. But the grisly scene was not 
scary enough for Dominick De La Cruz, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 More to his taste was the cardboard box that held a mush of grapes and jelly, 
which to the touch feel like eyeballs popped out of their sockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really scary," Dominick said, clutching his mother's hand as he left 
the jail.

PASTOR SPREADS WORD WITH SLEIGHT OF HAND; RELIGION: METHODIST USES MAGIC TRICKS 
TO DELIVER A MESSAGE THAT 'WHAT WE SEE IS ONLY A TINY PART OF REALITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Unzipping his ministerial robe to reveal a black tuxedo underneath, a 
Methodist pastor preached a pre-Halloween sermon Sunday on magicians and 
mystics with the aid of cards, multiplying money and willing volunteers in the 
pews. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Gilbert Stones, a member of Hollywood's Magic Castle for 10 years, 
even pulled a rabbit out of a black box near the altar at Woodland Hills United 
Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before Halloween seemed an appropriate occasion to use his 
semiprofessional talents, said the 39-year-old preacher with handlebar mustache 
and Vandyke beard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are open to the idea (around Halloween) that the world out there is a 
little wider and maybe more frightening than we usually think," Stones told a 
congregation of about 50 adults and children. "What we see is only a tiny part 
of reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The point of his sermon was that magicians, in the broad sense, are auto 
mechanics, doctors, scientists, occult practitioners or pastors whom people 
seek out to handle and perhaps control life's problems. They are not always 
trusted -- and in the case of an illusionist, shouldn't be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't lack for magicians, but we lack for mystics -- people who recognize 
that sometimes things just happen," Stones said. "Magicians don't like 
surprises. Mystics delight in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence of religion is letting God break through rather than scrambling 
around trying to control everything," said the minister, who has pastored the 
church for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The hymns and prayers in the service focused on the mystery and majesty of the 
divine. The New Testament reading was the Book of Acts account of the 
conversion of Simon the magician. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the serious themes in the service, the people in the pews applauded 
and laughed as Stones used sleight of hand, familiar magician props and 
bantering comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Church member Jack Smeltzer, who held the playing card he thought he had 
chosen from a deck, was told that the rabbit (which Stones earlier produced 
from an apparently empty box) was going to read his mind and indicate what the 
card is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make your mind a blank," Stones said, then adding quickly, "That was fast." 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor noted that rabbits can't talk, "but he's going to do something that 
rabbits can do -- no, not that." After the laughter subsided, the 
minister-magus pulled the rabbit from a box with a newspaper page that had 
three diamond shapes "chewed" out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man from the pews supplied a $5 bill that the pastor seemed to change 
into a $1 bill. "That's my $4 trick," Stones said. "Would anyone like to see my 
$9 trick?" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he repeatedly dropped two or three dollars into a box, and yet 
continued to count seven $1 bills still in his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if you could do that, you'd probably give a little more to the church," 
he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to his message on mystics and magicians, Stones said that the 
magician, regardless of his or her occupation, claims special knowledge and 
methods to obtain information about certain mysteries, and perhaps to change 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 They often wear special clothing and use special devices -- thus, he said, he 
wore his black tuxedo and used typical magician's props. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, mystics "simply seek to contact, to touch and commune 
with the mysteries beyond," not necessarily hoping for full understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Some use of "magic" is fine, even in church, the minister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we pray and ask God to do something, we are doing 'OK magic,' " Stone 
said. But because magicians of various kinds can't always make everything work 
as predicted, excuses are often offered -- the conditions were not right, the 
supplicant did not believe enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people get prayed for and they don't get cured," he said. Look to 
the mystic for insights, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mystic knows that if you pray for healing, you may not be cured, but you 
will be healed," he said. "Your life will be touched and transformed -- you'll 
never be the same." 
</P>
<P>
 In closing the service with prayer, Stones said, "Forgive our arrogance in 
those times when we think we know fully your mind and that we have all the 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation appeared pleased with the mixture of magic and message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleasantly surprised how he weaved the ideas in and out," said choir 
member Judy Vanderbock. Charlotte Johnston said she expected that Stones would 
not "trivialize the service or the church place we were in, and he didn't."

SEEING A NEED; OPTOMETRIST PROVIDES NO-COST EYE CARE FOR THE POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert Forbes once considered retirement. He even tried it for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he is 75. And he had spent nearly 20 years doctoring eyes in East 
Los Angeles. So he sold his optometry practice 10 years ago, bought a home on 
the beach in Oxnard and started taking it easy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the easy life didn't last long. Everywhere he looked -- in schools and 
hospitals and health clinics -- there were people who couldn't afford eye care. 
</P>
<P>
 And Forbes, a Polish immigrant who never could stumble across a problem 
without trying to fix it, said he just couldn't sit around when the need in 
Ventura County was so great. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, he volunteered to provide free vision care for children 
and senior citizens in Oxnard's La Colonia neighborhood through health programs 
at St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, he established an eye-care clinic for the poor at the 
county hospital in Ventura. Eventually, he recruited other optometrists so the 
clinic could be open once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Forbes opened a second clinic, this one at the Public Health 
Department in south Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer do county residents need money or medical insurance to receive eye 
exams and glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 By knocking on doors and making phone calls, by begging favors and refusing to 
take no for an answer, Forbes has patched together a system of no-cost eye care 
for those who can least afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't walk away from things when they need to be taken care of," 
Forbes explained. "You've got to do something with your life. Otherwise you're 
just taking up space." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Forbes hasn't done it alone. Optometrists in Camarillo, Oxnard and 
Ventura abandon private practices once a month to work for free in the eye-care 
clinics. The county has donated rent-free space for the endeavor. And a number 
of optical companies and eyeglass manufacturers also provide lenses and frames 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those who know Forbes best agree it was his persistence that brought 
life to the idea of eye care for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a great program," said Lisa Knapp, an Oxnard optometrist who 
volunteers at the Ventura County Medical Center eye clinic. "He saw there was a 
need, and he committed to it. He has really made it happen, pretty much by 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 And no one is surprised that Forbes, once retired, didn't stay retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not the retiring type," said Evelyn Burge, a public health nurse who 
rounds up clients for the free clinics. "We're fortunate to have people like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 On that point, Maria Rodriguez couldn't agree more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she brought her 6-year-old daughter, Jacqueline, into the clinic at 
the county medical center. After an eye exam at school, a nurse had told the 
girl she needed glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the money. We barely have enough to give our children something 
to eat," said Rodriguez, a farm worker from Santa Paula. "It's a big help for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Camarillo optometrist Dean Amundsen was running the clinic. He 
has had a private practice for 10 years, and has volunteered at the clinic for 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He would staff the clinic for more than three hours, long enough to see half a 
dozen patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm at the point in my practice where I'm busy enough that I can 
donate some time," said Amundsen, president of the Tri-County Optometric 
Society. "It's a pretty big effort when it comes down to it. And Dr. Forbes to 
a large degree is responsible for setting this up. " 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes was born in Poland and immigrated to the United States when he was 18 
months old. His parents made their way to California in 1921, where they 
established a chain of grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended Virgil Junior High School, Los Angeles' oldest junior high. He 
went to Fairfax High, Santa Monica City College, USC and the Southern 
California College of Optometry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then World War II broke out, and Forbes served in the Pacific with the Navy. 
He was discharged in 1945 and established a private practice in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, he raised three children. And it was there that his dedication 
to community service was born. He sat on the board of directors of the Eastside 
Boys Club and served on a variety of other community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just got this urge to do," said Cecelia, his wife of 53 years. "He's 
always been that way. I'm sort of used to it by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after her husband retired and they moved to Ventura County, Cecelia said 
she had little faith that he would stay out of circulation for long. 
</P>
<P>
 She was right. Forbes got to know the nurses at St. John's Hospital a few 
years ago, when he went in for back surgery. About three years ago, Gloria 
Chinea, a hospital health education worker, asked if Forbes would volunteer to 
help out at a children's health fair in La Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the energy," Chinea said. "I just saw the talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Forbes has been directing his talent toward battling 
diabetes-related eye disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his efforts, more than 30 optometrists from Thousand Oaks to Port 
Hueneme have volunteered to provide free eye exams in November -- National 
Diabetes Month -- to diabetics and others at risk of developing diabetic eye 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in people between 20 and 74. More 
than 50,000 diabetics live in Ventura County, and many of them have never had 
their eyes examined. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease hits minorities hard, striking one in three Native Americans and 
one in seven Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no early intervention, you can almost predict there will be 
diabetic eye disease eventually, which could lead to blindness," Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noelia Chavez, of the Latino advocacy group El Concilio del Condado de 
Ventura, said of Forbes: "We realize the seriousness of diabetes in the Latino 
community. And he has certainly taken a leadership role in helping address this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes said he hasn't done anything that anyone else, with a little bit of 
knowledge and time on his hands, wouldn't have done. 
</P>
<P>
 And he says it is others who deserve the credit. Optometrists like Michael 
Boggs in Ventura and Thomas Wolf in Oxnard also staff the clinics. And he 
salutes businesses as well, like Ventura Optical, which provides the lenses, 
and JAV Optical in Oxnard, which puts them into frames. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just make things happen because it isn't that difficult," Forbes said. 
"I'm sure a lot of people are no different than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Forbes said, helping out makes him feel useful. And it makes him feel 
young. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get in your 70s, people think you're an old geezer," he said. "I 
wasn't about to let myself be classified that way. I feel like they're doing me 
a favor at times." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 November is National Diabetes Month and more than 30 Ventura County 
optometrists have volunteered to provide free exams to screen for 
diabetes-related eye disease. More than 50,000 diabetics live in Ventura 
County, and many have never had eye exams. For more information, call 
1-800-DIABETES.

STREET SMART: OFFICIAL SAYS VENTURA AVENUE WAS NOT MADE FOR SHADE

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Help! 
</P>
<P>
 My distress comes from the fact that I recently moved to Ventura and 
discovered that there are very few trees on Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 This means no shade, little beauty and less oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Avenue looks as if it has had little attention paid to the lack of 
trees over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 What about taking the ficus trees the city is digging up on Main Street and 
replanting them on Ventura Avenue? 
</P>
<P>
 I am a very concerned mother with children who need to see nature. Please 
consider this request. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Periolat, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Avenue, which is one of the oldest streets in Ventura, was not built 
with trees in mind, said city tree coordinator Tom Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-food-wide space is the minimum needed to plant a tree. Many 
residential side streets off Ventura Avenue have grassy sections near the curb 
that are roomy enough for trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sidewalks on Ventura Avenue are often narrow, with no room for 
vegetation of any sort, Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the avenue was developed for storefront businesses," Downey said. "To 
this day, there is no space for trees." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote to you last May regarding the corner of Conifer Street and Oakleaf 
Avenue in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked that the county ban parking near that intersection because the parked 
cars block the vision of motorists trying to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, when county workers came out to look at the intersection, 
school was out for the summer, so the problem had temporarily disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that school is well into the fall semester, the problem has resurfaced. 
The intersection is as dangerous as ever, for both motorists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer White, Agoura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Street Smart forwarded your letter to Butch Britt in the Ventura 
County Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 After three visits to the corner of Conifer and Oakleaf, Britt and his 
inspectors decided there was no visibility problem at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 They did ask the owner of a large truck to park his vehicle elsewhere, so it 
would not block the view of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really did not see the type of problems that would lead us to prohibit all 
parking on those streets," Britt said. "When you do something like that, you 
have to look at it from all sides. The residents in the neighborhood would be 
pretty upset if we banned parking on their streets just because traffic gets 
heavy for a few hours each week." 
</P>
<P>
 But all is not lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Street Smart has forwarded your new letter to Britt, who said he will take one 
more look at the intersection to see if the problem has worsened. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the street railroad crossings in Simi Valley have been changed 
to the new surface coverings that are so nice to drive over. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception is the crossing just west of the Metrolink station on Los 
Angeles Avenue near Ralston Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans to change this one as well? 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Soles, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city is planning to install the smooth rubberized railroad track covering 
at Los Angeles and Ralston, traffic engineer Bill Golubics said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the city's seven crossings were converted in 1992. The reason for the 
delay on Ralston is that the crossing is much longer and more costly to 
replace, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the first six crossings cost about $50,000 apiece, the last one will 
cost about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has budgeted the project for 1996.

WALNUT CROP IS FADING AS FARMERS TURN TO CITRUS; AGRICULTURE: ONLY 250 ACRES OF 
THE ONCE-PLENTIFUL TREES REMAIN. SOME SEE THE INDUSTRY'S DEMISE DUE TO 
IRRIGATION, DISEASE AND OTHER PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A roaring clatter sounds from the hopper of a vintage walnut huller at Rancho 
Shangri-La in the upper Ojai, as a load of nuts hits sheet metal. The noise 
might as well be the crop's death rattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnuts, which once stretched across 15,000 acres in Ventura County, are down 
for the count. Most commercial growers have long since pulled them and have 
planted citrus trees in their place. Counting this 40-acre spread, perhaps 250 
acres of aging walnut trees remain, and their number is dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walnuts did very well in the '40s and '50s," said Ben Faber, University of 
California farm adviser in Ventura. "Then they started getting navel orange 
worm and husk fly, and that made it more expensive, since they had to start 
using insecticides. Everybody started saying, 'Let's get out of this business 
and find something that will pay more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the early '60s, half of the county's walnuts had disappeared. Now the vast 
majority of the state's 225,000 tons of walnuts -- two-thirds of the world's 
supply -- are raised in the state's Central Valley, where land is less 
expensive and the cold winters stimulate the growth of buds. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tierra Rejada Ranch in Moorpark, two acres of a 65-acre walnut orchard 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Production was never all that great," said manager Richard Brecunier. "The 
returns just weren't justifying keeping them. We felt we could do better with 
other crops." 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch, a member of Diamond Walnut Growers, sold its crop to the co-op's 
Saticoy packing plant. But as acreage declined, Diamond followed the crop 
north, and members had to truck their crop to Buellton or find independent 
buyers. The upsurge of the husk fly in the past several years was the final 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty trees and we hate to have to cut them down," Brecunier said. 
But "it's like any other business -- changes are being forced on us. You have 
to do what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Shangri-La is a holdout, perhaps the biggest walnut orchard left in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to water them and you don't have to feed them," said Betty 
DeBusschere, ranch co-owner and harvest supervisor. "That's hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The trees, with their massive root systems, are one of the few crops that can 
survive on Southern California rainfall. And the ranch is certified organic, a 
fact that ensures a substantially higher price for nuts, and a few more 
struggles with pests. 
</P>
<P>
 These trees are 40 years old, not yet halfway to walnut mortality if 
conditions stay moderately good. But with a prolonged drought and the freeze of 
'92, walnuts haven't been ideal for much of the past decade. And the current 
harvest looks scant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had that heat in August just too many days in a row. It could have been a 
bumper crop, but it's a sunburned crop," DeBusschere said, fingering the nuts' 
shriveled hulls. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the shaker is operating this year. The ancient harvesting machine, 
owned by a local contractor, is driven from ranch to ranch, where it toils down 
walnut rows, gripping trunks in a giant vise and vibrating the trees to create 
instant nut showers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five years, the machine has been out of commission and ranchers 
have shaken the crops from 60-foot trees with poles. No one wants to invest in 
a shaker because the vibration continually disables the mechanism, DeBusschere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the nuts hit the ground, another challenge faces the grower: finding 
pickers. Those who supply workers for other crops are not inclined to round up 
crews for the small nut harvest. Picking the crop from the ground and avoiding 
the sun-blackened nuts is not a choice job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went down to town and picked up some workers yesterday. When I explained 
the work, they didn't want to do it. I had to take them back down again," 
DeBusschere said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a few workers are filling bags of nuts, and the grower has hopes of 
completing the harvest within another week. She has contacted the wholesaler 
who paid $3 a pound for nut meats last year, but "I don't know if I'm going to 
have enough for him to bother with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of miles from Shangri-La is a more typical Ventura County walnut 
ranch -- a five-acre parcel owned by Bonnie Brown, who has had the property 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, three generations of the family has picked the crop, removed the hulls 
in a cement mixer containing rocks, then cracked the shells with hammers. 
Brown's parents, now octogenarians, are planning to return from Los Angeles for 
the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember when (walnuts) were almost throughout the upper Ojai," said 
Brown, who sits on the Ventura County Agriculture Commission advisory board. 
"Now, the water table's vanishing and (irrigation) is too costly. That's what's 
going to do them in." 
</P>
<P>
 She expects a few old customers to come to the ranch with picnic lunches and 
gather a winter's supply of nuts. The rest of the crop will go to local 
bakeries or markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are majestic trees," Brown said. "We like 'em and we try and make do. 
With the water going, they're stressing. And if they stress, they are 
susceptible to diseases, crown rot and all kinds of things when it does rain. 
We're finding a lot of crown rot now. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to be coddled. People say, 'Oh, walnuts, that's nice.' They do fine 
for a couple of years, and then they don't do so well, and they take them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown sees a bleak future for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fast fading," she said. "It's big-time going to be out of this county 
before my children have children."

THOUGH ADJACENT TO SIMI, SINALOA IS NOT ATTACHED; RESIDENTS OF THE 
UNINCORPORATED AREA GUARD THEIR FREEDOM FROM CITY GOVERNMENT AND REVEL IN 
NATURAL BEAUTY, TRANQUILLITY 
</P>

<P>
 In a town that prides itself on careful construction and uniform design, the 
narrow roads and mishmash of homes in the Sinaloa neighborhood are a Simi 
Valley planner's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched atop a grassy slope between the Sinaloa golf course and Sinaloa Road, 
the secluded hamlet houses decades-old dwellings in a rainbow of colors, from 
mud brown to fiery red to bright green. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sinaloa, modest bungalows squat alongside rambling mini-mansions sprawled 
on large, sometimes overgrown lots. Driveways of the neighborhood's more than 
250 homes lead onto narrow, curving lanes, many lacking the curbs, gutters and 
street lights required in most of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Sinaloa is allowed to flout city regulations is simple. Although 
surrounded by city property and receiving city water and sewer services, 
Sinaloa is unincorporated county property. 
</P>
<P>
 Its seven streets are paved by county workers and patrolled by sheriff's 
deputies, but its residents are barred from voting in City Council races or 
serving on neighborhood councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinaloa's independent status is the legacy of stubborn longtime residents who 
25 years ago successfully warded off cityhood, which they feared would bring 
higher taxes and intrusive government. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of a century later, the tiny pocket of county property retains a 
rural wildness long vanished from much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast is especially stark along Sinaloa Road, which borders the 
neighborhood. To the east, tidy homes are tucked behind a six-foot cinder-block 
wall that stretches unbroken for blocks. To the west, on the Sinaloa 
neighborhood side, aging eucalyptus trees tower above a patchwork of 
bougainvillea- covered picket and chain-link fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, many of whom have lived in the neighborhood three decades and more, 
have no desire to change the neighborhood's non-city status. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one more level of government you have to put up with," said Dean 
Seymour, who built his Sinaloa home in 1956 and fought against cityhood. "That 
is something I can definitely do without." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Price, who moved to Sinaloa with her husband and their four children 17 
years ago, said the lack of cityhood attracted them to the area. "Nobody 
bothers us, we can do what we want," she said. "We don't have to mow the lawn 
if we don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinaloa's resistance to the rules of Simi Valley has led to an unusual, and 
sometimes uneasy, relationship with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city basically takes the position that if people don't want to be a part 
of Simi Valley, we don't want to force them," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "It's 
illogical and imperfect, but that's how they want it." 
</P>
<P>
 One ongoing controversy centers around a brush-filled, 30-foot-deep pit that 
was once Sinaloa Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983 city officials who feared that the man-made, clay-bottomed lake would 
flood called in state inspectors to check its sturdiness. Much to the horror of 
lakefront property owners, the state ordered that their private reservoir be 
drained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the state that made the decision," Stratton recalled. "But we were 
kind of the rats that called the police, as it were." 
</P>
<P>
 One furious resident referred to the draining of the boomerang-shaped, 12-acre 
lake as a "rape and a murder." A group of lakefront property owners, who feared 
their home values would plummet, sued the state for $15 million. Two years ago 
a federal judge dismissed the suit, saying that state employees were just doing 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinaloa residents still mourn the loss of the lake, which served as a swimming 
and fishing hole and a tranquil setting for picnics and afternoon walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody built these little docks and you'd go out and sit and look at the 
water or jump in," remembered 35-year resident Diantha Ain, who lives at the 
end of Laguna Terrace. "People had little boats and they would catch bass, 
bluegill and catfish. It was wonderful, like living on a resort." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, tensions have mounted over a proposal to build an Iceoplex 
ice-skating rink at the corner of Madera Road and Royal Avenue, just down the 
hill from the Sinaloa neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago Sinaloa residents fought plans to build condominiums on the 
property, and some are no more pleased with the plans for an ice rink, which 
they worry would increase traffic and noise at the already congested 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we moved here it was so quiet, at night you could barely hear a sound," 
said William F. Hill, a retired optometrist who has lived in the neighborhood 
for 32 years. "Now that has changed, and every new development adds to that 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like resident Allan W. Jacobs, say they don't mind the ice-rink 
proposal, but are vehemently opposed to any other commercial development on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need places for our young people to go," said Jacobs, a retired associate 
superintendent for the Simi Valley Unified School District. "What we don't need 
is some big supermarket bringing in all kinds of traffic to a dangerous road." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which was approved by the Planning Commission at a marathon 
meeting in October, goes before the City Council later this month. Sinaloa 
residents have vowed to make their concerns clear to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that Sinaloans are not city residents may play a role in the 
city's decision on the project, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to come down and yell at the City Council about their concerns 
over the skating complex, and of course the council is going to listen," 
Stratton said. "But in the back of everybody's minds there's this little voice 
that says, 'Yeah, but these people don't vote.' We try to treat them like equal 
citizens, but it is different, no matter how you slice it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the political problems, Sinaloa residents said they have no desire to 
change their neighborhood's status. Residents like the freedom of a 
neighborhood with lots big enough for back yard weddings and lax zoning laws 
that allow add-ons and home-improvement projects without excessive government 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-one-year-old Dean Seymour appreciates the fact that he can ride his 
semi-wild, dun Mustang horse through the streets of Sinaloa whenever he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a great place to live," Seymour said. "I think I'll die here." 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour, who moved into the neighborhood in the mid-1950s, claims he has lived 
in Sinaloa longer than anyone else. But resident Tom Robertson has an even more 
impressive claim on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson's father farmed the land in oranges, grapes and persimmons before it 
was transformed into a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The original farm, which the Robertsons called Sinaloa after a town they had 
visited in Mexico, stretched more than 500 acres. The Robertsons built the 
Sinaloa reservoir to help water the crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great place to grow up," Robertson said. "Back then it was really 
wild, you could just roam free." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the Robertsons subdivided the property and sold off the lots, some 
of which are still held by their original owners. 
</P>
<P>
 These days homes in the secluded enclave don't come cheap. At the height of 
the real estate market in the late 1980s, some homes on one-acre lots were 
fetching close to $1 million, area realtors said. These days the fanciest 
houses go for between $500,000 and $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Kratochwill and her husband, who moved to the neighborhood just two years 
ago, recently launched a complete make-over of their 30-year-old stucco home. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny weekday morning, paint-splattered workers swarmed about the house, 
scraping off old dark-brown paint and slapping on fresh coats of a color 
Kratochwill described as "warm sandalwood." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here I didn't know my way around at all," she said. "But 
people were very helpful and friendly. Once you settle in, it's like a cocoon. 
You feel very cozy and protected." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is nearly nonexistent in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinaloa is served by the East County Sheriff's Station, located several miles 
west of the neighborhood on Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 One cruiser is responsible for county property scattered in and near Simi 
Valley, including Sinaloa, the Santa Susana and Box Canyon neighborhoods 
southeast of Simi Valley and the area between Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is wide ranging, which means officers have less time to cruise 
through each neighborhood, said Patti Dreyer, a senior deputy who has patrolled 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sinaloa's poor night lighting, overgrown brush and winding roads make 
the neighborhood less than ideal for patrol work, reported crimes in the area 
are few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, there have been just 200 calls for service in the neighborhood -- 
about 33 calls a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the people in Sinaloa have lived there for a long time," Dreyer said. 
"They know each other's habits and they look out for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 For the children of Sinaloa, the neighborhood offers play land galore. They 
frolic in the overgrown lake bed, bicycle through the quiet, winding streets 
and splash in the community pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, they say, is a hidden pathway leading to the back of the Madera 
Elementary School campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty neat," said 9-year-old Austin Westbay as he toted his oversize 
lunch box down the shady path on a recent afternoon. "You don't have to walk 
out in traffic to get to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin's mother, Linda Westbay, said she and her husband scrimped and saved to 
afford the $350,000 Sinaloa home they bought two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had wanted to move here for years, for the peace and quiet, the natural 
beauty, the beautiful homes," Westbay said. "Finally we were able to, and we 
couldn't be happier."

<P>
 The flames of last fall's fires have long since been extinguished, but their 
memory burns deep in the minds of those who dared, by chance or design, to 
stand before their broiling onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 A sort of melancholy persists.Thoughts can never linger long on those dry, 
windy weeks without turning as dark as the smoke that clouded cobalt skies. A 
friend lost. A home destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, wounds are healing. Houses are being rebuilt. Lungs 
scorched by hot, dry air sting less with every new breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Life continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, it was hard to imagine that it could. Over two weeks in late 
October and early November, it seemed as if most of Southern California was 
burning. The air was filled with the smell of smoke, at once both pleasing and 
repugnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, two major fires together burned some 36,500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The first -- and smaller -- was started in a gully in the Santa Susana Pass 
early Oct. 27. It spread quickly over the rocky hills, scorching 1,500 acres 
and injuring four firefighters, but miraculously did little damage to homes 
before it was contained 15 hours after it began. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck would not run as thick a week later when the Calabasas/Malibu fire was 
sparked in Calabasas. Over 30 terrifying hours, the smoke turned midday to 
midnight and gobbled up 35,000 acres between the San Fernando Valley and the 
Pacific Ocean, consuming 350 homes and killing three. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, The Times revisited five subjects or sites from those harrowing 
days, each image captured then in its own urgent instant. As the fire season 
returns once more, little in the path of fire is unchanged.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BANK OF A. LEVY POSTS $2.2-MILLION PROFIT 
</P>

<P>
 The Bank of A. Levy posted its largest quarterly earnings in nearly three 
years during the third quarter of 1994, bank officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which is in the process of being purchased by First Interstate 
Bancorp, showed a profit of $2.2 million in the third quarter, compared with a 
loss of $400,000 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of Bank of A. Levy, Ventura County's largest locally owned bank, to 
First Interstate is currently under review by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending approval, the sale should be finalized during the first quarter of 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's quarterly profits have gradually increased this year. In the first 
quarter, profits were $1.36 million, marking the first time in seven quarters 
the bank showed a profit. During the second quarter, the bank reported a 
$1.87-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign that the bank's overall position is improving is a decline in the 
number of its outstanding non-performing loans. 
</P>
<P>
 During the third quarter of 1993, the bank was not receiving payments on more 
than 10% of its loan portfolio. In the third quarter this year, that dropped 
under 4%. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CONTEST BRINGS OUT THE CREEPY -- AND 
THE CUTE

<P>
 With a two-inch skeleton dangling from his right ear and a plastic hook for a 
right hand, 3-year-old Nicholas Meffley looked every bit the pirate. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a red bandanna on his head, a hand-painted mustache above his lip and 
enough makeup to impress the judges, who promptly awarded him first place for 
the scariest-dressed 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to look scary," said his mother, Nicole Meffley of Thousand Oaks. 
"He really likes the movie 'Hook.' " 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 children showed up at The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks on Sunday 
for the 15th annual Halloween costume contest, a colorful mixture of court 
jesters, witches and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers sponsored by the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow White seems to be big this year," said Tee Devine, one of six judges who 
handed out first- and second-place prizes for the scariest, most original and 
cutest costumes. "We've seen a couple of spiders, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing the winners from the dozens of entries in each age group is no easy 
task, Devine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the worst job because they're all darling," she said. "We look for 
personality and clever costumes. But it's hard to narrow it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Heather Arsenault of Thousand Oaks painted her fingernails 
black and added bells to a purple and black court-jester suit she bought at a 
local department store for her Halloween costume. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like the Joker in Batman," she said, waiting for the announcer 
to announce the winner in her age group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is a lot of fun," said Mary Arsenault, Heather's mother. "It 
gives them a feeling of competition, but they all win." 
</P>
<P>
 Anastasia Rodriguez of Camarillo, all of seven months, was one of the youngest 
contestants. Her father, Juan, dressed the girl in a pale green jumpsuit with a 
felt sunflower around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't make it," said Rodriguez, who works at Camarillo State Hospital. 
"There's always next year. But maybe not. I don't want to put any pressure on 
the kid." JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; NEW HEARING SET ON CREEKSIDE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decade-long development dispute will come before the Thousand Oaks City 
Council again on Tuesday in a public hearing that could finally resolve the 
contentious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will decide whether Raznick & Sons developers can build 87 
single-family houses next to a Newbury Park wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, known as Creekside, has evoked strong opposition from neighbors 
and environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rejected the project once, and ordered Raznick Vice President 
Ellen Michiel to redesign the tract with bigger lots and less encroachment on 
the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Michiel's revised blueprints were rejected by the Planning Commission nearly 
three weeks ago, prompting her appeal to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will debate the case at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said she hopes the public hearing never advances 
to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she would like to send the project back to the developers to ask them 
to conduct a more thorough environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing several planning commissioners' concerns, Zeanah called the current 
environmental analysis flawed and inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we as a council would be suspect to even consider this project" 
without more detailed review, she said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; GROUP OFFERS REWARD IN HOLDUP OF STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Crime Stoppers is offering up to $1,000 for information leading 
to the arrest of a knife-wielding bandit who robbed a student in a Moorpark 
College restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, an 18-year-old Woodland Hills man, was held up at knifepoint about 
8:30 a.m. Oct. 10 while in a restroom near Building S on the Moorpark campus, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman, whose name was withheld for fear of retaliation, told deputies 
he was approached from behind by a man who put a five-inch serrated knife to 
his side and said, "Yo, give me your money," Sgt. Kitty Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the student complied, pulling about $40 from his wallet and handing 
it to the thief, who fled after taking the student's backpack. The robber ran 
up some stairs to a parking lot and escaped in a white, late-1980s Ford Mustang 
driven by an accomplice, who turned left onto Collins Street while speeding 
away, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber, whose head was fully or partially shaved, was described as a black 
man about 20 years old, 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. He wore a long baggy shirt 
and black baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime Stoppers, a private, nonprofit program in Thousand Oaks, invites anyone 
who might have seen the suspects or their license plate number to call 
494-8255. Callers can remain anonymous. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COFFEE CART AT COLLEGE CAUSES UNION DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weary students and thirsty teachers have a new alternative at Ventura College: 
a gourmet coffee cart tucked into the corner of the campus cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a small Formica stand called Grounds for Coffee, with a menu featuring 
caffeine-laced specialties such as iced cappuccino, cafe au lait and double 
espressos to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students love it," said Jerry Dunlap, who oversees the impromptu 
coffeehouse. "They're tickled to death that it's right here on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so tickled, however, are officials from the Ventura County Community 
College District's classified employees union. 
</P>
<P>
 They charged in a letter to Vice Chancellor Jeffrey Marsee that the stand is 
operating illegally by putting college students to work instead of unionized 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things need to be staffed by district employees," said Gregory Cross, 
field representative of the Service Employee International Union Local 535, 
which represents about 360 of the district's non-teaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were all on the same wavelength on these things," said Cross, 
who is negotiating a new union contract. "We're just trying to find out who's 
behind this." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee, who signed the lease with Grounds for Coffee, said his interpretation 
of the state education code allows the district to contract out for certain 
services without using its own employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a right to hire students," Marsee said. "We feel it's important that 
students be permitted to work. If the union is interfering with that practice, 
then we have a general concern that goes across the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Other franchise outlets in the district, including Taco Bell and Pizza Hut 
counters at Moorpark College, also employ students, Marsee said. Cross said 
those agreements are legal because they are run by unionized staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute does not concern Jennifer Ferraez, an 18-year-old psychology major 
who earns $4.75 an hour mixing the specialty drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps me pay for books and stuff," the Ventura College freshman said. 
"And it's right here at school, so I don't have to drive anywhere. That saves 
on gas." 
</P>
<P>
 The stand has been open since Oct. 20, when Dunlap finished uncoiling the 
kinks from the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were standing three deep," he said of his first customers. "We had three 
girls here and they just couldn't keep up. But part of that was because they 
had to keep checking the recipes." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Dunlap said, poetry readings and live music will be scheduled 
around the stone fireplace across from the cart. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so much better than kids going to bars," he said. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CAR MAY HAVE KILLED WOMAN NEAR RINCON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura woman whose body was found off Old Highway 1 near the Rincon late 
Saturday may have died after being struck by a car, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie June Case, 42, died after receiving multiple blunt injuries, 
according to Ventura County Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said evidence uncovered during an autopsy performed Sunday indicated 
that the woman may have been struck by a car. Small holes discovered on Case's 
forehead, thought initially to be bullet wounds, were actually the result of a 
1989 surgery, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Sheriff's Lt. Gary Cook said that an investigation into the incident 
was continuing and, as of late Sunday afternoon, no suspects had been arrested 
in connection with the death. J.E. MITCHELL

VALLEY HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING DAMAGED BY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire that began in the stairwell of an office building Sunday night damaged 
a familiar San Fernando Valley high-rise, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Called at 8:20 p.m. to the Valley Federal complex in the 6800 block of Van 
Nuys Boulevard, firefighters were confronted with intense smoke and discovered 
that the blaze had spread to the bank's multistory tower, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flames licked at the second and third floors of the building, radio 
reports indicated, before it was knocked down at 9:03 p.m. Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman Bob Collis said 65 firefighters from 13 engine companies 
were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 No damage report was available. The cause of the fire was not immediately 
clear.

N. HOLLYWOOD MOTORCYCLIST INJURED FLEEING FROM POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man who fled from police on a motorcycle probably saved his 
own life when he donned a helmet before trying to outrun officers on a chase 
through side streets that reached speeds of at least 60 m.p.h., authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Xavier Alvarado, 25, told police on Saturday that he was under the 
influence of methamphetamines, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Bruce Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded to a call of disturbing the peace in the 8100 block of 
Haskell Avenue about 3 p.m. and spotted Alvarado driving a motorcycle away from 
a house he reportedly had attempted to enter by breaking a window, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado drove through one red light and reached at least 60 m.p.h. as he 
began to ride uphill toward the intersection of Haskell Avenue and Superior 
Street, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bad wobble on the front wheel caused Alvarado to lose control of the 
motorcycle and crash onto the pavement as he reached the crest of the hill, the 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Alvarado sprawled in the intersection, with his personal 
belongings spread in all directions, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wearing the helmet probably saved his life," Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center where he was treated 
for lacerations to his chin and back, internal injuries and head trauma, police 
said. He was later moved to Los Angeles County USC Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A blood sample was taken to determine what, if any, illegal substances were in 
his system, Cowan said. Criminal charges are pending, awaiting the results of 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cowan, who was at the scene of the accident, Alvarado began 
shouting: "I want to die. Kill me, kill me," and other statements about bad 
drugs he'd received when police caught up with him.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: ONE ANGEL IN SEARCH OF ANOTHER AFTER SHOP SAVED FROM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jill Angel, manager of the American Cancer Society thrift shop in Northridge, 
hopes the man who saved the shop from an all-consuming fire will read this. 
</P>
<P>
 She has put a sign in the window asking the man to stop in to be properly 
thanked. 
</P>
<P>
 She says all the other tenants in the Northridge Garden Plaza would also like 
to thank him. 
</P>
<P>
 His actions may have saved the entire complex from going up in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems a light fixture in the thrift shop's window malfunctioned around 
midnight about a week ago. The man was walking by, saw the fire and called the 
Fire Department, which arrived moments later to put out the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he hadn't called, our shop, and possibly all the rest of them, might have 
been destroyed," Angel says. "We are grateful he made the call." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel and her volunteers are no strangers to catastrophe, starting with the 
Northridge quake that shut down the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were closed for two months because our shop suffered a lot of damage, and 
the problem was complicated when the complex owner declared bankruptcy," Angel 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that the cancer society was able to reopen in March with the help of 
a donation from the National Charity League and the assistance of the Phoenix 
Home Life insurance company, the complex lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the flood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of weeks ago a water heater burst and flooded the shop," says Angel. 
"All the new carpeting was ruined. The back of the shop was underwater." 
</P>
<P>
 That repair had just been completed when she learned the Fire Department had 
come in the night and put out the fire. "The fire could have been so much 
worse," says Angel, "if our angel hadn't made that call." 
</P>
<P>
 She says in spite of all the chaos, shop sales have been booming. "We normally 
raise about $200,000 a year for the cancer society and we think we will again 
this year," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel says the spirit of the volunteers has been astonishing. "Many of them 
are still living out of trailers or completely displaced (because of the Jan. 
17 earthquake), but they still come in to work at the shop." 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that all the upheaval has been challenging and the shop's survival is 
an inspiration to her. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real tragedy was loosing volunteer Sharon Englar who, with her 
husband, Phillip, were killed when their Northridge apartment collapsed during 
the quake. Turning Idea Into Action for Plan to Help Homeless 
</P>
<P>
 In July, The Times ran an On the Issues column in which opinions on how to 
help the homeless were asked of some experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Smedberg, executive director of the San Fernando Valley Interfaith 
Council, came up with one of the more interesting and creative ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 In his response, he said more shelters were needed, but that would be an 
expensive proposition and that it would help, if for a start, each of the 270 
church and temple members of his organization each adopted a homeless family. 
</P>
<P>
 He expanded on the idea to say that what the homeless need is not just a home 
or job, but also security, a sense that someone is there to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedberg said: "They don't have support mechanisms. Organizations for the 
homeless and religious congregations could see them through." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice idea. 
</P>
<P>
 One of maybe a million floating around. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedberg, however, wasn't satisfied just making the suggestion. He's taken the 
first steps toward putting the plan into operation. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the Interfaith Council is working with other groups that have a 
similar plan in other areas. "They are giving us guidance in setting up the 
program in the San Fernando Valley," Smedberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have appointed Craig Morantz to head up our task force. Craig was an 
intern with us when he was at UCLA working on his master's degree," Smedberg 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the program is finalized, we will contact our members and enlist their 
support in launching the plan throughout the Valley," says the council 
director, adding that his group encompasses almost every religious persuasion 
in the area, and that many member congregations are already involved in the 
council's outreach work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run Meals on Wheels programs and help with other projects aimed at helping 
specific groups like the elderly, abused children and needy families," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedberg, a Peace Corps alumnus and graduate in the psychology department of 
Texas A&M, served as head of former Mayor Bradley's volunteer organization and 
also ran the local Lutheran Social Service group for seven years. Westways 
Celebrates With Congratulatory Pat on Back 
</P>
<P>
 Some folks think of Dutton's as the Lourdes of literature, not just as a North 
Hollywood bookstore with its owner as the guy who grew up in, and took over, 
the family book biz. 
</P>
<P>
 These folks may be interested to know he went AWOL for several years in the 
late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Read all about it in the November issue of Westways magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Westways is put out for members of the Automobile Club of Southern California, 
a precursor of that airborne phenomena known as the in-flight magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 With the November issue, Westways celebrates its 85th anniversary with a 
non-aerobic exercise: a look over the shoulder and a self-congratulatory pat on 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Westways has had, over the years, a goodly number of renowned contributors, 
including Ray Bradbury, William Saroyan, Carey McWilliam, Anais Nin, Jack 
Smith, John Espey, Carolyn See and Steve Erickson who wrote about growing up in 
the Valley in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also had some top-level editors, including founder Phil Townsend Hanna, 
the widely admired Frances Ring and the talent-collecting Larry Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another editor, remembered kindly in the November issue as having guided the 
book during the late 1960s was none other than Davis Dutton, otherwise known, 
to the literary loiterers at Dutton's bookstore, as Dave. Overheard

ROAD CLOSED AFTER FIRE SYSTEM FAILS

 Torrey Road south of Piru was closed late Sunday after a fire-fighting system 
at a Unocal Corp. propane pumping station failed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officers sealed off the roadway south of Telegraph 
Road (California 126) as a precaution after a water deluge system failed about 
8:45 p.m., a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known how much -- if any -- gas had escaped from the 
company's Torrey Hill Pump Station at 3824 Guiberson Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials dispatched a hazardous materials team to the scene 
to determine why the system failed and if gas had escaped from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported in the incident. J.E. MITCHELL

SPEEDING DRIVERS ADD TO ROAD'S DEADLY RISK; TRAGEDY: KEVIN MARTIN, 13, IS 
LATEST VICTIM ON SIERRA HIGHWAY, WHERE BLIND CORNERS AND HEAVY TRAFFIC POSE 
DANGERS.

<P>
 About two weeks ago, 13-year-old Kevin Martin died when a van hit him as he 
was riding his bicycle near a blind curb close to his home on Sierra Highway, 
leaving his parents with a sense of hopeless frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Jim and Hollie Martin had warned their four children repeatedly 
about the dangers of the heavily traveled thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew better than to be near the road at that time," his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Martins moved to a double-wide mobile home along Sierra 
Highway eight years ago because it was a quiet place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, mainly because of the large number of commuters from the 
fast-growing Antelope Valley, traffic on Sierra Highway has been so heavy that 
the Martins wouldn't even let their four children cross the road to get the 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Several family pets have been struck by vehicles. Driving out of partially 
obscured driveways along the highway is a risky proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the couple participated in a protest rally along the mostly 
two-lane road, hoping to send a message to speeding motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Martins don't blame the driver of the van for the accident that 
killed their son. He was, after all, driving under the speed limit when it 
happened. But they are upset that what used to be a quiet country road has 
turned into an alternate to the Antelope Valley Freeway for commuters -- and a 
danger to local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand in this kitchen and I see people passing on the double yellow line, 
and I yell at them from the kitchen window, 'You idiots!' " Hollie Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident that took Kevin Martin's life was the second fatality this month 
on the stretch of Sierra Highway between the Santa Clarita and Antelope 
valleys, where the Martins live, and the 47th traffic collision there this 
year, said Officer Michelle Esposito of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers are aware that the road is a trouble spot: Two officers on a 
special patrol of the area wrote 44 tickets for speeding and other traffic 
violations during one daytime shift last week. But Esposito said the CHP seldom 
has extra manpower available to patrol the road, and regular shift officers 
have to concentrate on the heavier freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents along the highway said it usually remains quiet at night and during 
the middle of the day. But long straightaways and gentle curves make it 
possible for a constant stream of rush-hour commuters to hit speeds of up to 80 
m.p.h. on a road with a 55 m.p.h. speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They practically push you," said Kathleen Robinson, a woman in her 70s who 
moved five years ago into a house near the curve where Kevin Martin was killed. 
"You're going the speed limit, but they want you going 65 or 70." 
</P>
<P>
 Impatient motorists pass slower cars at high speeds, endangering oncoming 
vehicles on a daily basis, according to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not too many experiences that can equal someone coming downhill at 
you in your lane at 80 miles per hour, flashing their lights and swerving just 
in the nick of time only because you have slammed on your brakes to avoid 
becoming another Sierra Highway statistic," wrote John Sage, a friend of the 
Martins, in a letter of complaint to Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael 
Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Desolate stretches of Sierra Highway are interrupted suddenly by driveways and 
intersections that appear just around a curve or over a hilltop. Populated 
areas such as Acton and Agua Dulce have dozens of driveways that intersect the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents said the burden is on them to take precautions when entering 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my choice, I'd be driving a Peterbilt," said Lisa Murchland, 33, who 
lives with her two children in a house at the top of a small hill where Sierra 
Highway briefly divides into four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-lane section ends just south of her driveway, and Murchland said she 
sees a constant stream of vehicles trying to pass at high speeds -- often on 
the wrong side of the road -- before they are beyond slower vehicles. She said 
she has not seen any accidents in front of her home, but her dog was run over a 
year ago by a speeding truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers noticeably pick up speed in the mornings, when many are headed to 
work, Murchland added. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not getting paid to rush home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents in the area have suggested adding a lane in each direction to 
lessen congestion on the Antelope Valley Freeway. Caltrans officials said a 
widening was planned for a 16-mile stretch of the freeway beginning in 1995, 
but a shortage of funds because of repairs from the Northridge earthquake could 
delay the expansion indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting in stop signs at intersections and reducing the speed limit was also 
suggested. Sage's wife, Terri, said a lot of motorists exit the freeway at 
congested sections, use Sierra Highway for a short distance and return to the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we've got a few stop signs up, people who get off freeway to use (Sierra 
Highway) would stay on the freeway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A county public works employee who asked not to be identified said Sierra 
Highway with its current speed limits would be a safe road "if everyone drove 
the speed limit." 
</P>
<P>
 But most commuters don't, and more are moving into the Antelope Valley -- and 
commuting to Los Angeles -- every day, said Hollie Martin. She said she doesn't 
want to leave the area, but thinks it is time to move from her roadside home 
before another tragedy strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told my husband many times I would like to move back away from the road, 
and get away from the highway," she said.
