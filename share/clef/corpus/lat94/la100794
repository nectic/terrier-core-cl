ILLEGAL FARM WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the article "Raisin Farmers Hit by Shortage of Workers" (Sept. 27), Harry 
Kubo of the Nisei Farmers League is quoted as saying, although illegal 
immigrants may burden the education and welfare systems, legal workers simply 
refuse to fill many of the manual labor jobs throughout the state. Statements 
to this effect have appeared regularly for years in discussions about the 
presence of illegal workers. What surprises me is that no one seems to see this 
as an indictment of the American attitude toward good, honest work of the most 
basic and necessary kind. 
</P>
<P>
 We have millions of poor people on welfare programs huddled in big city slums 
but no one to work in the farms. The poor are, in part, victims of 
circumstances beyond their control. Mechanization and dehumanization of farm 
work are factors in the equation. Overmechanization and distorted ideas about 
what constitutes respectable work are part of the problem. But whatever we do, 
if we are to survive as a nation, we must disabuse people of the notion that 
American citizenship is a graduation certificate from the rank of worker to the 
rank of welfare recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of agribusiness and the fading away of farm communities need to be 
scrutinized. Efficiency experts and social scientists should work out a better 
balance between production needs and humanistic considerations.

<P>
 Harry Kubo's upset there's not enough labor to harvest crops. He states that 
many illegal immigrants are not available for work this season. Why would any 
farmer even consider hiring an illegal immigrant? What does the word illegal 
suggest to them? 
</P>
<P>
 Kubo's argument that legal workers won't perform this type of work just won't 
wash. Solution: Pay legal workers a living wage. If a decent, living wage was 
paid, Kubo and his farmer friends would be turning away legal workers. If 
prices of goods go up, the consumer is not forced to buy. Eventually the market 
will adjust itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Kubo claims 50% of the work force in his area is illegal. If so, let's turn 
the INS loose. Substantial mandatory jail time should be afforded these people 
who knowingly hire illegals.

<P>
 Regarding raisin farmers finding a shortage of laborers due to the Proposition 
187 debate, I have a suggestion where they, and all other employers of illegal 
immigrants, a.k.a. cheap labor, can find manpower plus help our society in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that the governor and the prison systems organize crews of workers 
drawn from the pool of nonviolent state criminals. In that way prisoners would 
be contributing to the debt they owe society for their crimes and their 
incarceration, plus providing cheap labor for jobs now being filled by the 
illegal immigrants.

THEATER REVIEW; STRUGGLING TO KEEP THE FAITH; DAVID HARE'S 'RACING DEMON' 
PROBES BRITAIN'S RELIGIOUS QUANDARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I have no theology," says Streaky, a drunk Anglican priest in David Hare's 
"Racing Demon," which had its American premiere Wednesday at the Doolittle 
Theatre. And yet Streaky goes on to express his faith in a monologue to God. 
"The whole thing's so clear. You're there. In people's happiness. Tonight, in 
the taste of that drink. Or the love of my friends. The whole thing's so 
simple. Infinitely loving. Why do people find it so hard?" 
</P>
<P>
 That is a very good question, and Hare seeks to answer it in the 1990 "Racing 
Demon," the first play in a trilogy that considers the vast gulf between 
Britain's most powerful institutions and the human beings they fail to help. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact Streaky (Adrian Scarborough) does have a theology, a good one, perhaps 
the only one. But in the Church that Hare depicts, Streaky's theology is just 
about irrelevant. To American audiences, or to anyone who is not in awe of the 
Anglican Church, Hare's depiction of an institution rife with hypocrisy may be 
extremely obvious. The Royal National Theatre production, directed by Richard 
Eyre, supplies a properly ponderous tone to examine what for church members 
must be weighty questions. But, away from home, "Racing Demon" has the feel of 
a work that is preaching to the converted. 
</P>
<P>
 The political problems of the church may be a metaphor for the problems of all 
British liberal institutions, as Eyre and Hare argue in an interview in the 
play's program. But the church is not just any institution, it is one that 
claims to have the answers to how people should live, answers that it cannot 
enforce with the strength of law (Hare explores the problems of the judiciary 
in "Murmuring Judges," the second play in the trilogy). So how can the church 
persuade people to follow its non-compulsory teachings, particularly in poor 
urban areas where parishioners are dropping out in large numbers? 
</P>
<P>
 These are the questions that Hare's inner-city priests wrestle with, both 
against each other and against the diocese as well. No one actually has any 
ideas about how to help the masses, represented here by a poor, young black 
woman named Stella (Joy Richardson), whose husband forces her to have an 
abortion. Lionel, played by Oliver Ford Davies, who won the Olivier Award for 
the role, is a kindly, befuddled and ineffectual priest who offers friendship 
to Stella and a lame prayer. This inflames the young Tony (Adam Kotz), to whom 
his elders refer laughingly as "the combustible curate," and who believes the 
church must actively intervene in the lives of its parishioners. If this stance 
helps his career, all the better. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony is less than scrupulous in relation to his human responsibilities. He 
is unclear about how his needs as a man relate to his duties as a priest, and 
so he treats his lover Frances (Saskia Wickham) unfeelingly. 
</P>
<P>
 His attempt to help Stella produces a total fiasco. Before long Tony turns 
into a full-fledged zealot, and a dangerous and unsophisticated one at that. To 
Tony's way of thinking, God inflicts Lionel with misfortune because Lionel is 
wrong in opposing Tony. But Tony's own misfortune -- the death of both of his 
parents -- was God's method of helping him to find his way. Who would mistake 
this egocentric self-righteousness as true belief? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishop (Richard Pasco) is similarly unbearable. When Lionel dares to 
oppose him, the Bishop, who is being dressed for a service in his fine robe and 
miter (big hat), angrily accuses Lionel of having "an appearance of superiority 
which is wholly unearned." It is quite clear that the Bishop, who calms himself 
by accepting a scepter from an underling, is quite sure that he has earned his 
appearance of superiority. But to whom this news would be shocking, I'm not 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 On the large, largely empty stage at the Doolittle, lighting designer Mark 
Henderson (and Luc Batory for the Los Angeles production) make beautiful 
pictures in the highlighting of human flesh tones against the black background 
from which lone men and women step forward and struggle to make sense of God. 
But the production's visual centerpiece -- a huge rectangular screen on which 
slides are projected -- is quite ugly. The photos, suggesting an English 
garden, a church, a city street, look like the slide show a neighbor makes you 
sit through on his return from London. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors who play the good priests, the three wise men of the play, are all 
superb. Davies wonderfully mixes a personal humility with the essential 
arrogance of sarcasm. Scarborough's Streaky supplies the heart of the play and 
gives the evening's most winning performance. Michael Bryant, as a priest 
brought down by the insinuations of a sleazy journalist, is achingly human. The 
religious men who are more successful in their careers are less good at 
recognizing the complexity of accepting religion in an imperfect world. These 
performances are less interesting. As Frances, the nonbeliever who nevertheless 
talks to God, Wickham gives a technically unimpeachable but bloodless 
performance.  
</P>
<P>
 David Hare seeks to critique institutions by showing that they measure up 
short by their own standards. He finds the church guilty of valuing men of 
faith over men of conscience. "Christ came to help the poor," offers Lionel, to 
which the Bishop replies with barely concealed annoyance, "I know your views." 
</P>
<P>
 This happens in the play's first few moments, and the theological debate never 
progresses far beyond that point, although a couple of good men's lives are 
destroyed in the process. Hare's moral, I believe, is simply this: If Jesus 
were a parish priest in the Anglican Church, he'd be out of a job.

 Balanchine Dispute: A contract dispute caused four works by the late George

Horgan, executrix of Balanchine's estate and head of the New York-based 
Balanchine Foundation, told The Times that the works were pulled because of the 
disagreement between the foundation and Columbia Artists Management Inc., which 
is producing the dance tour. Officials with Columbia in New York declined to 
comment. The dancers will instead present pieces by emerging choreographers.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MOONSTRUCK' DOESN'T STRIKE TWICE; NORMAN JEWISON'S ROMANTIC 
COMEDY 'ONLY YOU' WOULD BE HARD ENOUGH FOR CARY GRANT AND GRACE KELLY TO CARRY, 
LET ALONE MARISA TOMEI AND ROBERT DOWNEY JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Only You" is mostly ersatz. An implausible romantic comedy that is flimsy 
even by the elastic standards of the genre, it counts on star power to 
compensate for a lack of originality, but it is not to be. 
</P>
<P>
 A fluffy knockoff of "Sleepless in Seattle" that makes that film's charming 
plot seem as rigorously logical as a mathematical theorem, "Only You" owes so 
much to so many movies the word derivative isn't quite strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
 While stars are defined by their ability to carry vehicles others couldn't 
begin to lift, Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr., certainly an engaging 
couple, are not up to the task here. Diane Drake's script, directed by Norman 
Jewison, would strain the star power of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, and Tomei 
and Downey, although they try their hardest, lack the heft to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Tomei has the job all to herself. In a pair of brief prologues, 
Faith Corvatch is glimpsed as quite an impressionable young girl. First, at age 
11, she and her bratty brother Larry manipulate a Ouija board to determine the 
name of her life's soul mate. The answer: Damon Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a couple of years later, a shady fortuneteller at a carnival utters the 
same name, along with a bit of pivotal advice: "The truth is, you make your own 
destiny. Don't wait for it to come to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to 14 years later, when Faith is a perky teacher in a Catholic school, 
engaged to a fussy podiatrist named Dwayne who made the ultimate sacrifice at 
the moment of proposing: He turned off his beeper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But true to her name, Faith, a romantic who loves watching Ezio Pinza and Mary 
Martin sing "Some Enchanted Evening," has not given up on her childhood fantasy 
of a soul mate named Damon Bradley. All this to the scorn of best friend and 
sister-in-law Kate (Bonnie Hunt), married to the grown-up but still drippy 
Larry (Fisher Stevens), who understandably thinks love is largely an imaginary 
notion. 
</P>
<P>
 All these issues might have remained theoretical except for a phone call from 
a long-lost friend of Dwayne's, who talks only long enough to tell Faith he's 
on his way to Venice and leave his name. Yes, it's Damon Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Faith is only 10 days away from her wedding. She has to find 
out if this Damon Bradley is her Damon Bradley, and, with a dubious but 
protective Kate in tow, immediately boards a plane for Italy to bring her 
quarry to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you buy this premise (a sizable if) and admire Marisa Tomei's squeaky 
energy (somewhat easier to do), the twists "Only You" takes in Italy are 
predictable, preposterous or both as Faith pursues Damon through a host of 
feebly imagined difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the appearance of a lively Robert Downey Jr. as a New Jersey shoe 
salesman who claims to be Damon Bradley clears things up. Increasingly wearing 
and bogus obstacles arise, and the question of whether this match is destiny or 
not gets dragged out to unnatural lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 What is dragged into the mix are Kate's marital problems, as, not 
surprisingly, she is having Larry trouble. Trying to make her forget she even 
has a husband is the suave Giovanni ("Clear and Present Danger's" Joaquim de 
Almedia), a standard-issue Italian who doesn't miss an opportunity to say 
things like "the female body has always been the mystery, the essence of human 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 All of "Only You's" stars acquit themselves solidly, with Hunt making the 
strongest impression as the cynical Kate. But director Jewison, who covered 
similar territory more efficiently in "Moonstruck," does not appear to have his 
heart in this version. 
</P>
<P>
 With loving shots of swank yachts, romantic restaurants and the kind of hotels 
the rich and famous frequent, "Only You" plays more like a pleasant travelogue 
than an involving film. While those desperate for even hollow romanticism will 
perhaps be satisfied, put up the slightest bit of resistance to this film and 
it falls apart in your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for some mild sensuality and language. Times guidelines: It 
features more romantic fantasy than sensuality. 'Only You'

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CARO DIARIO' A THREE-PART VISUAL DIARY; NANNI MORETTI'S FIRST 
AMERICAN RELEASE SHOWS THAT -- DESPITE SOME TALENT -- HE IS NOT LIKELY TO ENJOY 
THE SAME SUCCESS HERE AS MANY OTHER ITALIAN FILMMAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nanni Moretti's "Caro Diario" (Dear Diary) introduces to American audiences 
the quirky Italian filmmaker whose eight films over the last 18 years have 
established him as a cult figure in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Moretti has an off-the-wall comic sensibility with an 
anti-Establishment attitude and a graceful style, he is not likely to enjoy the 
same success in America as many other Italian filmmakers. The man is funny, 
sometimes provocative, but he also seems parochial, his purported metaphysical 
concerns elusive -- and he's not a little self-indulgent and long-winded. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfolding in three episodes, the film, his first to receive a U.S. release, is 
literally a visual diary. The first episode, "On My Vespa," is the strongest, 
in which Moretti, a trim, bearded man of 40, takes us on a highly personal 
motorcycle tour of Rome and its outskirts that is loaded with amusing 
encounters, including a meeting with none other than Jennifer Beals, the woman 
of his dreams ever since "Flashdance," a watershed experience for Moretti, a 
frustrated dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a hilarious sequence that has him confronting an ailing critic (Carlo 
Mazzacurati) with his thuddingly pretentious review of "Henry: Portrait of a 
Serial Killer," which we glimpse dubbed into Italian. The episode concludes 
with Moretti paying a respectful visit to the site where controversial director 
Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered. Throughout the "Caro Diario," Moretti is 
immensely aided by Nicola Piovani's vibrant, mood-establishing score. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second episode, "The Islands," Moretti and a friend, Gerardo (Renato 
Carpentieri), who's obsessed with both deciphering James Joyce's "Ulysses" and 
the medium of television, are supposed to be working on a script but embark on 
a tour of a series of idyllic island communities, where in one place they 
discover all the children love to give callers, eager to speak to their 
parents, a hard time on the phone.  
</P>
<P>
 If "The Islands" starts wearing thin, "Doctors," the final episode, wears even 
thinner as Moretti visits a raft of specialists, each with a different 
diagnosis and treatment, in search of a cure for his bad, widespread bodily 
itch. This single joke rapidly gets pretty tired; you soon wish you could tell 
Moretti to try slapping on some calamine lotion -- and getting on with his 
life. But stringing us along -- with varying effectiveness -- is his life.

A DILUTED GENRE SALUTESITS ROOTS; COUNTRY MUSIC: NAMING OF MERLE HAGGARD TO THE 
HALL OF FAME IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF AWARDS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There are roots and then there are roots . 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when a collection of songs by a '70s Los Angeles rock band won the 
Country Music Assn.'s album of the year award, the real deal at Wednesday's 
ceremonies in Nashville came with naming Merle Haggard to the Country Music 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Country's popularity boom of the past few years has been attributed in part to 
the arrival of a generation of artists who grew up with pop and rock as well as 
country influences. But the danger is a dilution of the country essence 
embodied by veterans such as Haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 Nashville likes to banner its enduring links to its pioneers, but it doesn't 
mean much at a time when careers are powered by video productions and 
radio-ready records. It's a sad fact that Haggard -- who at 57 is still doing 
work at least as vital and significant as the next Confederate Railroad single 
-- can't get airplay as well as accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmylou Harris' dignified and eloquent exposition of Haggard's life and music 
was the highlight of the nationally televised show, which offered little in the 
way of drama or upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Gill, the evening's host, unassumingly accepted the male vocalist and 
entertainer of the year honors -- both were virtually foregone conclusions. Pam 
Tillis' win as female vocalist was the closest thing to a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the year of the Big Event Record in an oddball album field. The winning 
"Common Thread," a set of Eagles songs performed reverently but timidly by some 
of country's top names, competed with Asleep at the Wheel's salute to Texas 
swing legend Bob Wills and the all-star, soul-country hybrid, "Rhythm, Country 
& Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Jackson and George Strait were also in there, but those special projects 
left these 28th annual CMA awards slightly inconclusive about the stature of 
today's key artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the corporate contest behind the performers, though, Arista Records' 
country division and its chief Tim DuBois -- considered the second-most 
powerful executive in Nashville to MCA's Tony Brown -- made an assertive move 
with the wins by Tillis, Brooks & Dunn (best duo), Diamond Rio (group) and Alan 
Jackson (with Jim McBride for "Chattahoochee" as song of the year). 
</P>
<P>
 The other winners: 
</P>
<P>
 Single: "I Swear," John Michael Montgomery and producer Scott Hendricks; vocal 
event: Reba McEntire and Linda Davis' "Does He Love You"; musician: Mark 
O'Connor; video: "Independence Day," Martina McBride and directors 
Deaton/Flanigen/Andy Singer; Horizon Award: John Michael Montgomery.

CLUB REVIEW; AT BOURBON SQUARE, THE RETRO IS REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 At Bourbon Square, time stands still. 
</P>
<P>
 The venerable Van Nuys nightclub continues to celebrate the rock of the late 
'70s and '80s -- but not in a cutesy, retro/revival sense.Apparently the folks 
there share a genuine love for that era's much maligned pop-rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old, two-room venue offers its two stages to bands with names such 
as the Dixie Playboys, Hap Hazard and Caress of Steel -- a Rush ( shudder ) 
cover band that packs the larger room (which is open Wednesday through 
Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
 With the Sunset Strip slowly abandoning its "Poison" years, Bourbon Square has 
also become a haven for people who still want a taste of that scene. The 
casually clad crowd is composed of people who consider getting "carded" at the 
door a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an uncanny sense of abandon at Bourbon Square -- it's OK to like Poco 
or REO Speed-wagon here, no explanations necessary. After a recent set by a 
band called Cheeze Whiz, Journey's "Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' " came on the 
jukebox, causing the customers to burst into song.  
</P>
<P>
 There's this overwhelming feeling that Bourbon Square, which features KISS 
tribute band Parasite on Oct. 22, is the place folks visit to relive their high 
school years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bourbon Square, 15322 Victory Blvd. 21 and over, cover varies. (818)

JAZZ REVIEW; A POTENT SAX FROM SANCHEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember this name: David Sanchez. That's Dah-veed Sahn-chez. Might as well 
get the preferred pronunciation right up front, because if the Puerto 
Rican-born tenor saxophonist's appearance at the Jazz Bakery Wednesday night 
was any indication, it's a name that is going to be highly visible in the jazz 
of the '90s -- and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another of Dizzy Gillespie's discoveries, Sanchez, 26, has been one of the 
busiest players in jazz since he worked with the late trumpet great's United 
Nation Orchestra in 1991. This year, with the release of his first solo album, 
Sanchez has taken both his music and his potential up a level. 
</P>
<P>
 His playing, understandably for a young tenor saxophonist, reveals traces of 
Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane. But only as foundational elements. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's program, for example, Sanchez mixed standards with originals, 
constantly starting on familiar ground, then challenging his listeners to track 
his intensive improvisational explorations. Like Sonny Rollins, he took a 
standard -- "Falling in Love With Love" -- and played a set of variations that 
pulled the melody in all directions, tossing and recovering bits and pieces of 
phrases, while always retaining a strong sense of the tune's familiar identity. 
On other numbers -- a gorgeous rubato passage on "It's Easy to Remember" was a 
good illustration -- he scanned the harmonies with a Coltranesque vision and 
his own warmly intimate tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Several originals were based on Caribbean rhythms. One of the most impressive, 
the multi-metric "The Departure," initially echoed the buoyant dance qualities 
of Rican bomba bands. But Sanchez's soloing, powerfully backed by drummer Adam 
Cruz, pianist Dave Kikoski and bassist Ed Howard, quickly moved into more 
exotic territory. His string of choruses -- exploding with a collection of 
sounds that reached across the length and breadth of his instrument -- provided 
the final evidence that Sanchez is quickly becoming a player to be reckoned 
with. 
</P>

JAZZ NOTES: SCOFIELD'S 'HAND' REVAMPS FUNKY SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember those '60s and '70s funky jazz hits like Lee Morgan's "The 
Sidewinder" and Les McCann's and Eddie Harris' "Compared to What"? These were 
tunes that had a rollicking R&B bounce that was coupled with sophisticated jazz 
improvisation, pleasing both listeners' heads and their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist John Scofield, whose sound can crackle like a live wire loose on the 
ground, was a big fan of that style and thought it could use a '90s revamping, 
which is exactly what he did on his new Blue Note album, "Hand Jive." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something that was soulful," says Scofield, who leads his 
quartet Tuesday through Oct. 18 at Catalina Bar & Grill in Hollywood. "This 
style was pre-fusion, where you had an R&B element that is very swinging that 
jazz players can expand on. And it had pretty much disappeared," even though 
everyone from Miles Davis to Charles Lloyd had given their take on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The punchy-lined, swinging Scofield has long been a blues enthusiast -- some 
of his first successes were blues-based tunes like "Cissy Strut" -- so his new 
album treads some familiar turf. But the Dayton, Ohio, native makes it clear 
that tunes like "I'll Take Les," a nod to McCann, and "Do Like Eddie," which 
honors Harris -- who plays on the album -- aren't simply regurgitated 
throwbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is past music, yes, but my version of it," he says. "When you go up on 
the stand to re-create, it's always a failure. What you want to do is create. 
It's those things that are not quite what you had in mind that really work out. 
That's the special stuff, the stuff that gets developed. When you play with 
creative musicians and without a lot of expectations, they'll be patient and 
create something new each night." 
</P>
<P>
 Scofield has one of the best crews in jazz, built around drum ace Bill Stewart 
and stalwart bassist Dennis Irwin, and abetted by Larry Goldings on piano and 
organ. The band's been together about a year, formed last fall after saxman Joe 
Lovano left the guitarist's employ after a four-year stint. While Scofield 
misses his ex-front-liner, he feels he's got a great thing going with Goldings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry's not only into be-bop, he can play funky and he can play free," he 
says. "And, unlike a lot of pianists, he doesn't cover everything when he's 
accompanying me. He always thinks in a group sense." 
</P>
<P>
 After Lovano departed, Scofield didn't want another saxophonist, so he 
auditioned pianists, finally selecting Goldings. He says having a piano gives 
him harmonic support, and, since there's no saxophone, he's now the lead voice, 
and that's exciting. "It makes me feel like I'm the singer, or the saxophonist, 
and there's a trio behind me," he says. "It allows me to leave a lot of space." 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist stresses that at Catalina he won't just play material from his 
new record, and will include older originals and some be-bop classics like 
Charlie Parker's "Big Foot." "I want to cover all the bases," he says. 
Information: (213) 466-2210. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Guitar Redux: Mark Whitfield made three albums for Warner Bros., but he was 
starting to get bugged at the label's insistence that he venture into 
pop-oriented directions. "I said to myself, 'This is enough.' I want to play 
jazz. This is not what I want to do," Whitfield says, referring to "Patrice" 
and "Mark Whitfield," his second and third albums for Warners. "My goal has 
always been to travel the world playing jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 So when the guitarist with the resilient, straw-colored sound got a chance to 
sign with Verve Records and make a purely mainstream album, he jumped in with 
both feet. Whitfield, who plays Wednesday at the House of Blues, has just 
released "True Blue," a collection of blues-based pieces that spotlights saxman 
Branford Marsalis, pianist Kenny Kirkland and drummer Jeff Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to write some music that would be bluesy, that would swing and 
that would bring the most out of those musicians," he says of "True Blue." "I 
was anxious to hear what they would do and they pushed me to new heights." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitfield appears at House of Blues with his quartet, featuring Victor Atkins, 
piano; Roland Guerin, bass, and Donald Edwards, drums. Information: (213) 
650-0247.

MUSIC REVIEW; LYMPANY OPENS AMBASSADOR'S 20TH SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the road roughly since the mid-1940s, pianist Moura Lympany, now a genial 
78, still tours. Why? Perhaps because audiences continue to appreciate her 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sympathetic listeners crowded into Ambassador Auditorium Wednesday night 
for the first event of the hall's 20th anniversary season certainly appreciated 
the veteran musician's fluid and communicative pianism -- and expressed their 
approbation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lympany may not retain strongly the impeccable technique and hot-blooded 
Romanticism of her own heyday. But she still produces a limpid tone, leaps all 
mechanical hurdles without apparent strain and -- most important -- makes 
beautiful and elegant music all the while. If she were Japanese, her countrymen 
would dub her a National Living Treasure. Since she is English, the queen has 
made her a Dame of the British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Greatness is in deeds, not titles, of course, and Lympany did her admirable 
deeds in behalf of Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, Debussy, Rachmaninoff, Liszt and 
Chopin. In the process, she lived up to our memories of her legend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recital officially part of the continuing UK/LA Festival of British Arts, 
Lympany achieved the most touching playing in the second half, wherein she 
offered music of aqueous textures and titles -- "Reflets dans l'eau," "L'isle 
joyeuse," "Les jeux d'eaux a la Villa d'Este," for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoothly flowing and imperturbable, her performances became as prismatic and 
detailed as possible, but without emphasizing, or even revealing, the means by 
which such effortlessness is accomplished. Perhaps the high point of this 
accomplishment came in two Rachmaninoff Preludes from Opus 32, those in G (No. 
5) and B minor (No. 10), both examples of the most sensitive kind of 
tone-painting and detail-illumination. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a few bad moments -- a handful of exposed cracks and misstrikes -- the 
first half went similarly well. 
</P>
<P>
 After a tentative run-through of Beethoven's 32 Variations in C minor, 
Mozart's K. 330 Sonata moved along in a pleasant and mundane manner until magic 
struck in the middle of the slow movement, and the minor-section Trio opened up 
a world of color and feeling other Mozarteans simply do not find in this work. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Book II of Brahms' "Paganini" Variations unearthed a secret sometimes 
forgotten: that the musical content of this set is more interesting than the 
required technical tests. There is a subtext here, and it is both emotional and 
abstractly narrative. Lympany passed the tests while ignoring them and gave us 
the Brahms we know, the one who sings and feels. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the evening, Dame Moura offered encores: two pieces by Chopin, 
the "Harp" and "Black Key" Etudes.

RESTAURANT NOTES: ONE MORE SANCTUARY FOR INDUSTRY TYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There just aren't that many restaurants in town where you can get a decent 
meal at 1 in the morning. Downtown's Pacific Dining Car and the Original Pantry 
Cafe, Monkey Bar & Grill on Beverly Boulevard and Dan Tana's in West Hollywood 
are all that come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, club promoters Dimitri Christoforidis and Billy Adkins plan to cash in on 
the scarcity of late-night dining spots. In November, the partners will open 
Sanctuary in Beverly Hills. Celeb investors include "Baywatch's" Pamela 
Anderson; Costas Mandylor, the cop on "Picket Fences," and Poison lead singer 
Brett Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 Adkins ran the VIP room at Stringfellows when it first opened and promoted 
several affairs at Bar One on Sunset. Christoforidis manned the 
butterfly-engraved glass door at Stringfellows until it closed and claims he 
was responsible for putting together the deal that established the Gate, a La 
Cienega Boulevard nightclub-restaurant with private limo entrance for special 
guests. But Gate partners Albert Gersten and Camille Bennett say otherwise. "He 
was host for one week and was terminated," Gersten said through his spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Gate opened, nobody knew who Albert Gersten and Camille Bennett 
were," responds Christoforidis. "Most people came to the Gate because I told 
them to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Christoforidis now hopes his many friends will seek out his new supper club. 
Located in the former Asylum space on Robertson Boulevard, Sanctuary will have 
much the same look and feel of the former restaurant, including the fabulous 
Art Nouveau decor.  
</P>
<P>
 Maitre d' Jean-Jacques Retourne is no stranger to L.A.'s restaurant scene, 
either. "I was opening manager at Tatou, but spent the last eight years of my 
life working with Michel (Richard). I helped him build and run Citronelle (in 
Santa Barbara)." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a moderately priced menu featuring lots of fresh fish and chicken 
dishes ("New World Cuisine," the partners call it), there will be a late-night 
supper menu consisting of salads, pizzas and other light entrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a lot of young people in here, a lot of stars, so we are going to 
try to keep the menu as clean and healthy as possible," says Retourne, who is 
also putting together the wine list, which includes 15 different Champagnes. 
Brian Keller, formerly of Stars in San Francisco and briefly of Morton's (the 
new version), is in charge of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 And the name? "(The owners) wanted something very peaceful," explains 
Retourne, "a place where people in the industry could feel safe and quiet among 
themselves without having a bunch of people bugging them." Like an Asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where Frites Give Way to Fries: La Cachette was supposed to be open by now, 
but former L'Orangerie chef-turned-restaurateur Jean-Francois Meteigner says he 
had a minor setback. "We had a problem with one investor. The guy flaked on 
us," Meteigner says, "but we worked around it." The restaurant is now slated to 
open for dinner Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the former Champagne Bis on Little Santa Monica (the French 
restaurant owned by Sophie Healy that closed earlier this year), the space has 
undergone a complete renovation. Meteigner and partner Liza Utter have 
whitewashed the walls, installed roomy banquettes and a fake fireplace and hung 
huge mirrors.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the menu and name are French (La Cachette means hideaway ), Meteigner 
doesn't want the place to be known as a French restaurant. "We want to try to 
be more French American , with a more American atmosphere," he says. "When 
Sophie ran the front it was a little stiff. We hope to create a very warm 
atmosphere. The karma for French restaurants has been really strange lately."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CHEZ HELENE BRINGS THE AIR OF COUNTRY INN TO BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a neighborhood of mid-rise office buildings, Chez Helene endures, a 
near-magical evocation of a French country inn. One enters through a bower of 
morning glory lit from within by tiny lights. More lights twinkle in the trees 
on the patio, where hardy souls dine in brisk autumn air. Diamond-paned windows 
glimmer with rosy light. In an attic window: the silhouette of a black cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside: brick walls, wood beams, worn Chinese rugs. Dried vines and flowers 
wreathe mantles. A fire flickers in the back room. Cooking smells waft from the 
kitchen, a sensation, I realize, missing from most restaurants thanks to the 
ubiquitous exhaust fan. Chez Helene feels so like a private home in rural 
France that our group spins a story: A woman named Helene was such a good cook 
that her living room and parlor slowly turn into dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Non, non, insists a dissenter. Helene must be the cat, the cat who graces the 
menu, peers from the attic; a black cat like those in the beautiful antique 
French poster hanging in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 If asked, owner Marcheline (Mimi) Herbert tells the true story. Helene, she 
says, was one of the original partners when the restaurant opened 21 years ago 
in Venice. She left after a year, Herbert replaced her and eventually bought 
out the other partner. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cats: "It's a long story," Herbert says with a sigh. In Venice, 
there were troops of neighborhood felines. Herbert fed them every morning. Cats 
swarmed to Chez Helene. It was a customer who gave Mimi that poster in the 
hallway. After that, chic cat silhouettes appeared everywhere, even on the 
charge slips. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the smell of meat roasting, the cozy dining rooms and the good 
service, a person could just purr. The kitchen's straightforward and somewhat 
anachronistic French cooking can be quite lovely, although it can also be 
unremarkable and already pricey food seems way over-priced. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly expect better bread than dry, thin-crusted rosemary or olive 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 A starter of blanched asparagus has a green satisfying crunch, but the 
tarragon mayonnaise is a translucent, tasteless glue. Herbed goat cheese in a 
lidded jar of puff pastry resembles something served at a '60s bridal shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Better to start with soup. Potato leek, pureed to the color of canvas, is 
earthy and smooth. Cream of tomato soup with its few, slippery slices of 
mushroom and flecks of dry basil is true consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 A large salad of Belgian endive and walnuts needs a subtler, less acerbic 
dressing -- perhaps the delicious balsamic vinaigrette that came on a special 
grilled eggplant salad. The Caesar is exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees have a simple home-cooked quality. No doubt chicken roasted with 
rosemary originated centuries ago somewhere around the Mediterranean, but so 
far as I'm concerned, its source is Chez Helene. That's where I first ate it, 
at any rate, about nine years ago. The skin is brown, crispy, the meat 
unbelievably juicy and infused with rosemary tucked under the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Calf's liver, marinated in olive oil and lemon, then swiftly sauteed, melts in 
the mouth: It's among the best I've ever eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Side dishes, however, are confusing. Slices of roast lamb, perfectly 
medium-rare, come with classic overcooked string beans. Why no potatoes, 
though? Why no vegetables with liver or steak? Only the person ordering a fish 
special is given a choice of potatoes or vegetables. The best side dish, 
crusty-brown corn souffle, comes only with the chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauces can be uneven. The night of the awful tarragon mayonnaise, salmon 
arrived in a grainy, pungent mustard sauce that only enhanced an odd muddiness 
in the fish -- and scared me off any other sauces. On my next visit, I 
hesitantly tasted the steak au poivre's bearnaise -- and found it fluffy, 
silken: the perfect counterpart to meat bristling with cracked pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 A chomeur, the waitress says, is vanilla cake baked with raspberries or 
caramel, "like an upside-down cake." She doesn't say that it tastes 
extraordinarily like pancakes. A tart lemon pie and the dense, gooey flourless 
chocolate cake, however, make for a happy ending. 
</P>

FIRST IMPRESSIONS; A DIFFERENT FRENCH FARE AT LES ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA, TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Gruest is back at the same Pasadena corner where his restaurant Fleur 
de Vin flourished and then faded. This time he's acting as consultant for the 
new restaurant Les Arts.He's brought in a French chef from Lyon, Jean Marie 
Konnert, and is proposing a moderately priced menu (that is, if you order 
carefully) of light contemporary French cooking. Quelle surprise! It's not the 
same old roast chicken and frites . 
</P>
<P>
 By my informal count the word Provencal appears just once on the menu and 
pasta shows up only in a salad with Sevruga caviar. Instead, Konnert is cooking 
escargots in red wine sauce with poached quail eggs, scallops with green 
tomatoes, roasted pigeon breast with cabbage and the wee bird's legs served up 
in a salade . Fearless gourmandes can dig into the sauteed foie gras of the 
day, while more careful souls can choose dishes made without cream or butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Arts is also offering a prize to thank customers for their support during 
the opening weeks. If you dine at Les Arts before Nov. 15 and leave behind your 
business or calling card, your name will be entered in a drawing for a 
round-trip first-class ticket for two: LAX-Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to paying the bill, however, better have one of those 
alternative cards in hand. "American Express is expressly not accepted," notes 
the press release. 
</P>
<P>
 * Les Arts Restaurant, 70 S. Raymond, Pasadena. (818) 583-8275. Open seven 
days a week for dinner until midnight weekdays, until 1 a . m . Fridays and 
Saturdays. Lunch starts Wednesday. Valet parking. Visa and MasterCard accepted. 
Appetizers $5-$15; entrees $16-$25.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SKILLFULLY, KOTTKE BYPASSES FLASH TO GET TO HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leo Kottke, long treasured for his prodigious guitar skills, has another 
talent that's every bit as great. And that equally impressive craft -- getting 
to the heart of a song and cradling it front of an audience -- was at the 
center of his Coach House performance Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternating between six- and 12-string guitars, Kottke played a typically 
eclectic set, sprinkled with his trademark wry, between-song patter. His casual 
conversation and sincere musical presentation lent a drawing-room atmosphere to 
the club's roadhouse decor. And though his set lasted nearly two hours, time 
seemed suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Kottke's ability to focus on a song's strengths was most apparent on the 
familiar numbers, the ones we've all heard hundreds of times. 
</P>
<P>
 As on "Peculiaroso," his recent CD produced by Ricki Lee Jones, the guitarist 
made magic from Klaus Gunter-Newman's "Wonderland by Night," the nostalgic 
instrumental ditty that bandleader Bert Kaempfert took to the top of the charts 
in 1961 (propelled by Charly Tabor's pinched trumpet solo that, Kottke said 
later, gave the tune "a guacamole effect"). Here, without the additional 
instrumental ornamentation heard on "Peculiaroso," Kottke revealed the song's 
soul, bringing out its melancholy beauty without cheap appeals to sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise "Eight Miles High," the Byrd's peace-and-love era anthem that's 
easily dismissed as just another drug culture tune, was given a thoughtful, 
slow-paced airing. This time it was Kottke's vocal that took center stage, with 
his careful enunciation and well-separated phrasing revealing the lyric to be a 
visual statement of alienation, as weighty today as in the heady '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Kottke was so enwrapped in the song's words that they seemed to 
escape him and, smiling at his error, he re-entered the verse. But this 
apparent mistake added impact to the delivery, rather than breaking the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kottke's voice, never a polished instrument (which he readily acknowledges), 
played a central role in Wednesday's show. Compared with his speaking voice, a 
baritone with all the warmth of grandma's quilt, it sounds narrow and compact. 
But he adapts it well, and his tones rang true and clear on such up-tempo 
laments as "The Room at the Top of the Stairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Kottke also put his considerable skills as a lyricist on display, notably with 
"Parade," a poetically haunting piece that reflects a boyhood experience in 
Cheyenne, Wyo. The tune's calculated pauses brought depth to his words, framing 
each phrase to be viewed like a gallery-hung painting. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Kottke's guitar stylings that remained most impressive. A listen to 
the recently reissued compilation "6- and 12-String Guitar" from 1969 shows his 
current work to have more polish, ringing with an almost orchestral depth while 
ranging freely along the full scale of his instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 His Coach House playing was so pure, precise and filled with ringing chords 
that one almost forgot about the technique required to produce such a sound. 
But Kottke himself seemed to point up his talents by frequently adding a 
dramatic pause after an especially difficult passage, something that still 
managed not to distract from his presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Cathy Cornell, who worked solo from an electric keyboard, provided 
lighter fare with original tunes that, among other things, discussed serial 
love affairs, pushovers for love and cross-dressers. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying herself with strong blues and barrel-house piano play, Cornell 
came across best during her more humorous pieces. But her ballads, simple tales 
of love and loss, fell flat with bland lyrics and a predictable sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying the same intelligence to her serious pieces as she demonstrates on 
the slice-of-life numbers would bring that material up several notches.

THEATER BEAT: 'ASHES' STILL GLOWS IN REVIVAL AT THE FOUNTAIN THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The joy of sex, the cold indifference of medical specialists, the anguish of a 
failed attempt at parenthood -- these are the emotions that linger from David 
Rudkin's beautiful play "Ashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncannily adept at mining awful meaning from the everyday, Rudkin excels at 
the kind of precise, deeply felt writing that can make one behold the world in 
a fresh, if not always happy, way. 
</P>
<P>
 The seriocomic "Ashes" concerns the plight of Colin and Anne (Brian Markinson 
and Jacqueline Schultz), a thirtyish couple in Britain whose struggle to 
conceive or adopt a child seems cursed by fate. 
</P>
<P>
 As they move through a succession of experts and crackpot fertility schemes -- 
including a visit to a haughty, high-priced "semenologist" (Kenneth Danziger, 
in one of many amusing turns) -- the tone grows progressively darker and more 
biting. The couple's quest becomes a slice-of-life metaphor for human 
desperation in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Sachs' crisp production is played out on a deliberately sterile set, 
dominated by the marital bed that, tellingly, also serves as examining table. 
In this forbidding environment, Markinson pulls off the delicate trick of 
conveying Colin's cocky charm and nagging self-doubt. Given a less showy role, 
Schultz can still break hearts as the frustrated would-be mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacular performances and sparkling language make this "Ashes" worth 
seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ashes," Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., through Oct. 29. Also this Sunday only at 7 p.m. 
$15-$17.50. (213) 663-1525. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes. SCOTT COLLINS

THEATER BEAT: CHASING 'ROUND' FUN AT ACTORS ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Round and Round the Garden" at Actors Alley is the final play in Alan 
Ayckbourn's 1973 trilogy "The Norman Conquests." Still resiliently contemporary 
in tone, the play suffers little wear and tear from being lifted out of the 
triptych's framework and performed solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman (Joe Garcia) is the comic hub, the whirling center from which all 
sexual complications arise. An assistant librarian with a flair for the 
dramatic, Norman has libidinous designs on his unmarried sister-in-law Annie 
(Karen Reed), who is getting tired of waiting for her stodgy admirer Tom (Alex 
Glas) to make some definitive move, be it honorable or licentious. When Annie 
backs out of a planned weekend tryst with Norman, he gets blotto and promptly 
proceeds to pitch woo at his prim sister-in-law Sarah (Sandy Rosenberg), who, 
although purportedly happily married to Reg (Barry Pearl), proves surprisingly 
receptive to Norman's pawings. 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of Norman's savvy, no-nonsense wife, Ruth, (Diane 
Sainte-Marie), sister to Annie and Reg, yet more hell breaks loose, as 
obfuscations mount upon follies, with Norman's towering vanity overshadowing 
all. A well-meaning Lothario who sincerely wants the women in his life to be 
happy, Norman is fortunately as ineffectual as he is randy. Despite the present 
crisis, one feels that family unity will ultimately prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 With his cast of American actors, director Joseph R. Sicari has a hard row to 
hoe in this quintessentially British "Garden." However, despite the 
occasionally errant dialect and a slightly wooden performance by Sainte-Marie, 
Sicari harvests a nosegay of comedic performances. Garcia, who plays the best 
drunk since Foster Brooks, has a puppylike sincerity that spares the play any 
hint of the nudge-nudge, wink-wink school of sex farce. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Round and Round the Garden," Actors Alley, 5220 Lankershim Blvd., North 
Hollywood. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Ends Oct. 30. $18.

THEATER BEAT: 'MILL FIRE' COOLS AT WEST COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High above the city of Birmingham, Ala., rises the statue of Vulcan, god of 
the forge. The statue is now a sadly ironic metaphor for this Southern 
manufacturing center, whose forges quickly cooled in the steel bust of the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in Birmingham in the late 1970s, Sally Nemeth's "Mill Fire" at West Coast 
Ensemble fails to evoke this rich setting or this turbulent time, drifting 
instead in the void of director Avner Garbi's technically scrupulous but 
thematically unspecific staging, which fails to pin down the period, the place 
or indeed the pulse of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 What results is more dirge than elegy. Nemeth's drama deals with the tragic 
aftermath of a steel mill explosion, particularly as it affects a young woman 
widowed in the disaster. The feisty young widow Marlene (Carol Adele Davis) 
rejects the mill owners' attempted cash settlement, denouncing their offer as 
blood money, a beau geste that alienates the three older women widowed in the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 These three widows function as a kind of Greek chorus throughout, stalking 
through the set in widows' weeds and commenting on the proceedings in what 
seems a near-trance. Indeed, with the spirited exceptions of Eamon Hunt, who 
plays Marlene's mill supervisor brother, and Carol Stanzione as his drunken 
missus, the tone remains unremittingly funereal -- effectively so during 
Marlene's genuinely cathartic outburst at the play's end. However, even the 
self-consciously sensual cavortings of Marlene and her hunky husband Champ 
(Josh Carmichael), prior to the accident, can't thaw the ice around the corpse 
at this wake. 
</P>
<P>

 Trap a battling son and father in an office building elevator over a long 
weekend and what do you get? A mild case of claustrophobia, but not necessarily 
a play. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Bagot plays the son Eddie, opposite Burton Sharp as his dad, Art.A 
middle-aged Peter Pan who is still trying to shake off the effects of his 
father's toxic parenting, Eddie yearns to confront Art with his true feelings. 
Art, still brutalized by his own father's abandonment in childhood, and also by 
his traumatic experiences as a World War II fighter pilot, just wants to let 
the sleeping dogs of the past lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagot, who also wrote the piece, displays the heavy hand of an armchair 
psychologist as his one-dimensional characters struggle toward "closure" -- and 
a painfully predictable denouement that sends this "Elevator" plummeting to the 
cellar.

ANDRE LWOFF; MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PIONEER, NOBEL PRIZE WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Lwoff, a pioneer in the field of molecular biology and a co-winner of 
the 1965 Nobel Prize in Medicine, has died at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Lwoff died Sept. 30 in Paris, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist shared his Nobel Prize with two French colleagues, Francois 
Jacob and Jacques Monod, for their discovery that the genetic material of a 
virus can be assimilated by bacteria and passed on to succeeding generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lwoff earlier discovered that genetic material can exist outside the cell's 
nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
 Born May 8, 1902, in Ainay-Le-Chateau, Lwoff got his first science degree at 
age 19 and in 1921 entered the Pasteur Institute, France's world-renowned 
research center. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, his attic headquarters, where he worked with Jacob and 
Monod, fast became one of the key sites of the molecular revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 His work on the role of vitamins -- components needed for life -- demonstrated 
that they could function as enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1959 to 1968, Lwoff held the chair in microbiology at the University of 
Paris' Faculty of Science. He was visiting professor at numerous universities, 
including Harvard and the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lwoff was a foreign member of the U.S. National Academy of Science, Royal 
Society of London and Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 In later years, he became active in family planning and was president of the 
French Movement for Family Planning from 1970-74. 
</P>
<P>
 Lwoff is the author of two works: "L'Ordre Biologique" (The Biological Order), 
1969, and "Jeux et Combats" (Games and Combat), 1981.

 And would it be admissible in court?Writer John M. Wilson spotted a marquee in 
front of a West L.A. church that asked:

 TV turf wars: It's always a shame to see evidence of a new tagger in the 
neighborhood. We found the accompanying markings on the sidewalk outside the 
L.A. Criminal Courts Building, near the entrance used by the vehicle that 
transports Simpson (see photo). After consulting with several experts, we've 
concluded that this is the work of a camera-toting gang from Burbank.

 The physical side of L.A.: You've heard about the bright lights of L.A. But 
what about the street lights? Some books on the geography of the city: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Manhole Covers of Los Angeles," by Robert and Mimi Melnick (Dawson's Book 
Shop, 1974). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Stairway Walks in Los Angeles," by Adah Bakalinsky and Larry Gordon 
(Wilderness Press, 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Art of Street Lighting in Los Angeles," by Eddy Feldman (Dawson's Book 
Shop, 1972). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Street Gallery: A Guide to 1,000 L.A. Murals" by Robin J. Dunitz (RJD 
Enterprises, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Early Cemeteries of the City of Los Angeles," by Edwin Carpenter (Dawson's 
Book Shop, 1973). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It Started With a Nickel," Mary Elizabeth Pansini La Haye (Nickel 
Publications, 1988), a biography of Andrew Pansini, who founded L.A.'s first 
parking lot, at 4th and Olive streets, in 1917. (Pansini charged just a nickel 
a day but didn't validate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some L.A. features have yet to be explored, though. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, no Angeleno has written a counterpart to Ken Eichenbaum's epic 
work, "The Toilets of New York," (Literati Books, 1990). That tome was 
described as "a handy guide to the best (and the worst) public and semipublic 
relief stations." 
</P>
<P>
 When it's written, we hope that the "Toilets of L.A." book will employ 
Eichenbaum's concept of including "walking and trotting maps." 
</P>
<P>
 Readers of such a book would be well advised to also read "Manhole Covers of 
L.A."

 Where's Robin when you need him?The story, as we heard it, involves a husband 
and wife who recently decided to add a little excitement to their sex lives, 
somewhere north of Ventura Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 So one night, he tied her to their bed and left the room. Moments later, he 
barged through the door in a Batman costume, executed some karate kicks and 
began trampolining on the bed. Alas, he bounced up and hit his head on a 
ceiling fan. Luckily, the fixture was turned off. But he still managed to 
render himself unconscious. His wife's screams alerted the neighbors, who 
called police. They untied her and revived the Conked Crusader, who no doubt 
wished he could hide in one of the manholes of L.A. miscelLAny In the 1860s, 
when barbers dabbled in other disciplines, A. Meyer of L.A. ran an ad 
announcing: "Gentlemen will be waited on and have Shaving, Hair-Dressing, and 
Shampooing prepared in the most luxurious manner, and in the finest style of 
the art; while Cupping, Bleeding and Teeth-Extracting will also be attended 
to!" Sounds scary. But health care costs were lower.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: SCHIFF PROBES POLITICAL WEAKNESS IN ROGAN'S FINANCIAL 
MUSCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA and CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 ADDING IT UP: Campaign finance reports released this week show that Democratic 
challenger Adam Schiff has still not let state Assemblyman James Rogan 
(R-Glendale) run away with the campaign fund-raising honors, but the gap is 
widening. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan had raised $256,968 for his reelection race as of Sept. 30, according to 
the reports, while former Assistant U.S. Atty. Schiff had raised $162,029. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the last reporting period, from July 1 to Sept. 30, Schiff raised 
only $65,669, while the incumbent garnered $147,717 in contributions, including 
a $25,000 loan at 10% from Galpin Ford, the huge San Fernando Valley-based auto 
dealership owned by Bert Boeckmann. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Boeckmann's sizable loan prompted a cry of "Eureka!" from the Schiff 
campaign, which hopes to oust Rogan largely on the basis of his right-wing 
ideological and financial ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeckmann, the Schiff folks quickly noted, was a key California supporter of 
TV evangelist Pat Robertson's 1988 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the Schiff campaign, sensing that radical right-wing views are in 
disfavor in the 43rd Assembly District, has gloated over Rogan's support for 
teaching creationism in the public schools and the contributions -- albeit 
relatively minor -- that he has received from a group called Allied Business 
PAC and its principals. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied was founded by a small group of Christian conservative businessmen, and 
it has been a major donor to California politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again the radical right is trying to buy a legislative seat in 
California," said Schiff political consultant Parke Skelton. "But we anticipate 
the most Allied money to come in the final weeks of the campaign, because it's 
a liability for them to take the money, according to our research." 
</P>
<P>
 "We know their own poll has asked voters if it would be a liability for Rogan 
to take $50,000 from a fundamentalist religious PAC," Skelton added. He also 
noted that the Church on the Way, the Van Nuys-based congregation to which 
Boeckmann belongs, will be the venue for an Oct. 14 candidate forum being 
hosted by Robertson's group, the Christian Coalition.

 5TH DISTRICT FOLLIES: Could Barbara Yaroslavsky's bid to keep the Los Angeles 
City Council's 5th District seat all in the family cause a divorce? That's what 
some Los Angeles police union officials warned this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As a phalanx of Police Protective League officials Wednesday endorsed Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino for the seat now held by Zev Yaroslavsky, 
they also pledged to protest loudly if Mayor Richard Riordan endorsed Zev's 
wife for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between the league and the mayor -- which began auspiciously with 
the league endorsing Riordan's mayoral bid and refusing to budge even after the 
mayor's drunk-driving record came to light during the 1993 campaign -- were 
shaken during last summer's police-city wage talks. 
</P>
<P>
 And they could end up in divorce court, warned PPL director Bill Harkness, 
should Riordan fall for Barbara Yaroslavsky's candidacy. But Dennis Zine, 
another league member, said such talk is premature. "We hope we have enough 
rapport with the mayor that we can prevail on him not to endorse Yaroslavsky," 
Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of an imminent Riordan endorsement have been circulating since 
mid-August, when Barbara Yaroslavsky publicly threw her hat in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Riordan's City Hall staff have reportedly advised him to be 
neutral. But it is believed that the Yaroslavskys also have adherents within 
the Riordan circle. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the official word from the mayor's office: "The mayor likes Barbara a 
great deal, and the district has a wealth of great choices, but the mayor is 
not focused on that race right now," said Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also revealed this week that another 5th District candidate, former Los 
Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub, tried to persuade the league to 
endorse both D'Agostino and herself. But too late. 
</P>
<P>
 STILL IN THEIR SIGHTS: In the eyes of the gun lobby, state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) may be just about gone, but he is far from forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator, who is about to retire from his office because of term limits, is 
still very much on the minds of the group that gleefully takes credit for his 
political defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered over his assault-weapon ban, the gun lobby depleted Roberti's 
resources in an April recall battle, preventing him from waging much of a 
campaign for state treasurer in the June primary. Now, for the first time in 28 
years, Roberti will have no public office to occupy once his term ends in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make the gun lobby cocky. 
</P>
<P>
 A flyer inviting supporters to attend a Long Beach fund-raising dinner tonight 
to help defeat Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) calls the event "The First 
Annual David Roberti Memorial Dinner . . . held in memory of the man who became 
known as the 'godfather' of political crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The $100-per-person event is co-sponsored by the National Rifle Assn., the 
California Rifle and Pistol Assn., Gun Owners of California and Citizens 
Against Corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be among the first to see the Anti-gun Hall of Shame," the flyer says, 
adding: "The cuisine is Italian (what else for Mr. Roberti). There will be a 
special Roberti Roast, as David is remembered. . . . You could win quality home 
defense firearms known to Mr. Roberti as 'Assault Rifles.' "

SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The health insurance companies keep telling us we shouldn't vote for 
Proposition 186 because it would give Californians a health system like 
Canada's. We should have it so bad! 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to insurance company propaganda, Canadian patients and doctors love 
the single-payer system they've been using for over 30 years; 95% of the 
Canadian population prefer their system to the privately-insured system we have 
in the U.S. Only 1% of Canada's doctors describe their system as poor, while 
83% perceive it as very good or excellent; 85% of Canadian doctors agree with 
the statement that their system is preferable to U.S. health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are you going to believe: People who've lived with a single-payer system 
every day for decades, or U.S. health insurers' ad writers? The fact is, a 
Proposition 186-style health insurance system is the best available -- if 
patient and doctor satisfaction is the measuring stick. 
</P>
<P>

 * Re Proposition 186: If the $1 cigarette tax is intended as an inducement to 
stop smoking, why are liquor, beer and wine taxes omitted? A reduction in 
consumption of these items would be helpful in reducing the number of auto 
accidents caused by drivers under the influence, thereby lowering health care 
costs. I support a no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT HOYT 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Just as California is emerging from the depths of its worst recession in 
decades, along comes a plan that will cause a major backslide and put hundreds 
of thousands out of work. It may sound unbelievable, but that's exactly what 
Proposition 186 could do if it is approved in November. 
</P>
<P>
 It seeks to replace private health insurance with a state-run, 
government-controlled health care system. This $40-billion bureaucracy would be 
funded through increased payroll and income taxes. Supporters want to slap 
businesses with payroll tax increases of 4.4% to 8.9%, depending on the number 
of employees. And individuals would pay a 2.5% to 5% income tax surcharge, 
depending on their income. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 186 passes, it would force business owners and operators to lay 
off more employees, move out of state or go out of business. And what new 
business would want to create jobs in a state that requires an enormous payroll 
tax?

 "One Picture, Two Perspectives," by Karen Grigsby Bates (Commentary, Sept. 
28), asked the right questions, but failed to provide any answers in spite of 
the explanations, which were apparently supposed to be self-evident. Perhaps 
this unwittingly illustrates the problem.Bates perceptively identified an issue 
that confuses many white Americans who desire harmonious relations and equal 
opportunities for all races. Namely, that while there is much progress to be 
made, why not fight the good fight, instead of flailing about at perceived 
slights and injustices that have nothing to do with reality? 
</P>
<P>
 We've heard the many theories about how O.J. Simpson was the victim of a 
racist conspiracy by the white Establishment, as was Marion Barry. We've 
wrestled with the tortuous rationale that made heroes and martyrs of 
opportunistic thugs during the L.A. riots, and that euphemizes riots, looting, 
arson and racist assaults as an "uprising." We've heard far too many 
rationalizations by black community leaders in L.A. that absolve drug addicts, 
murderers and rapists from any responsibility for their deeds, preferring to 
blame a manipulative white Establishment. (Presumably non-black criminals 
exercise far greater self-determination.)  
</P>
<P>
 With the many substantive, but far more subtle and complex racial grievances 
that need to be addressed, it seems like this misdirected persecution complex 
dilutes the important efforts of those leaders with the courage to address the 
real issues, wherever they might lie and with whatever self-examination they 
might require.

EDUCATION WATCH; PULL THE PLUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley is nothing if not a realist. He 
has just released a plan, "Strong Families, Strong Schools," aimed at raising 
the level of parents' involvement in their children's education.It includes a 
list of "Seven Good Practices for Parents," all of which deserve warm support. 
But reading them suggests what teachers are up against these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Practice No. 6 begins: "Make sure your child goes to school every day. . 
. . " Doesn't that go without saying? Talk to a truant officer or two before 
you say yes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same category of light-one-candle modesty is Good Practice No. 3: 
"Limit television viewing on a school night to a maximum of two hours even if 
that means that the remote control may have to disappear on occasion." Two 
hours? Some parents permit no after-supper television at all on school nights, 
and we endorse their practice. But we do not fault Riley, who is honest enough 
to begin at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both parents in many of today's families work outside the home, part 
of the program is directed at employers, including the federal government. 
Under the new initiative, President Clinton has directed all federal agencies 
to encourage "flexible family-friendly work arrangements, including job 
sharing; career part-time employment; alternative work schedules, 
telecommuting; and satellite work locations." 
</P>
<P>
 All of that does indeed have something to do with a parent's finding time to 
read to a child. But so does a weeknight television blackout for the 
readers-to-be. Try it, parents.

CHANCE FOR A NOBLE FAREWELL; THE RETIRING MITCHELL CAN SAVE DESERT BILL BY 
DELAYING SENATE ADJOURNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beset by raw, mean-spirited politics, the proposed California Desert 
Protection Act stands at the precipice. Its fate now rests in the hands of Sen. 
George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader. The only way it 
can become law is for him to hold the Senate in session over this weekend to 
allow for a final cloture vote and passage. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Republicans, motivated solely by the determination to undermine Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein's bid for reelection, have resorted to every possible stalling 
tactic. By thwarting the clear bipartisan will of both houses of Congress and 
the people of California they hope to deny the California Democrat a key 
legislative victory to tout in her race against Rep. Mike Huffington. The House 
Rules Committee Thursday sent the final conference report on the bill to the 
House floor, and final passage there is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a handful of Republicans in the Senate have filibustered the bill at 
every juncture. On the last vote, they lost 73 to 20, with 15 Republicans 
joining the majority. Only one more cloture vote remains. But Senate rules 
require a 24-hour notice before such a vote, meaning that the final ballot 
cannot come before Saturday or Sunday, depending on when the House votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate is scheduled to adjourn today. Mitchell has the opportunity to 
perform one last, noble act before retiring from the Senate: He can keep that 
body in session for another day or two to salvage the eight years of work that 
have gone into preserving California's rich desert heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 The searing desert is far from the rocky down east coast of Maine, but it is 
important to all of the nation. We implore Mitchell to do what is right in his 
final days, by helping defeat the crude partisanship that has gridlocked 
Congress this year.

IN ARSON CASES, A LITTLE PRUDENCE; DROPPING OF CHARGE SHOWS NEED FOR FULL 
INQUIRIES, DESPITE PUBLIC CLAMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some thoughts worth pondering after the dismissal of a charge 
against an arson suspect in last year's Laguna Beach firestorm. First, 
authorities must take extra care in such high-interest cases, despite the 
public appetite for bringing culprits to quick and appropriately severe 
justice. Second, with its dry climate, Southern California must reckon with 
vulnerability to wildfires whether caused by Mother Nature or some crazed 
perpetrator; in either case, we must be well-prepared to respond to sometimes 
massive emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances surrounding the recent arrest -- and subsequent retreat by 
the Orange County district attorney's office -- were extraordinary. At a press 
conference last week Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi announced the filing of a 
charge against a suspect who had been arrested in connection with three small 
fires in Fullerton. Authorities said that during interrogation he confessed to 
starting the catastrophic Laguna blaze, describing in accurate detail where and 
how the fire was set. 
</P>
<P>
 That would seem to be a solid base for the filing of a charge. But this 
bizarre story was only beginning. Soon the suspect's mother raised an alibi, 
one that authorities eventually would confirm: The young man had been in a 
Mexican prison when the Laguna fire occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials understandably want to bring arson cases to a quick 
resolution. In the 20-20 vision of hindsight, even some routine checking might 
have spared the county the embarrassment that came from this case. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a similar rush to announce suspicion after the Nov. 2 Malibu fire, 
although the particulars were quite different. When authorities identified two 
firefighters as suspects, both were taken off firefighting duty. The Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office later said it did not have enough 
evidence to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 In any criminal investigation, authorities must refrain from reaching 
conclusions without sufficient inquiry. In instances where entire communities 
feel victimized, this is especially difficult . . . and especially important.

N. IRELAND: TIME FOR REAL DEBATE; BRITAIN SHOULD GRANT VISA TO SINN FEIN'S 
ADAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this week, two Northern Irish politicians, one of them Sinn Fein's 
Gerry Adams, met in debate on "Larry King Live." It's a debate that all of 
Britain should have heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the broadcast, the editorial page of the London Independent 
rightly said: 
</P>
<P>
 "After a long conflict that has claimed more than 3,000 lives, one might have 
expected the IRA's chief apologist to face vigorous public cross-examination in 
London and Belfast. Instead, the United States is playing host to the debates. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate is dragging its feet here in Britain, while in the United States 
and the Republic of Ireland, it is alive and fervent. British indifference to 
Northern Ireland allowed injustice to fester unchallenged for generations, and 
so provide a recruiting ground for the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger now is that paralysis here will hold up the peace. Britain should 
play its proper role, and not simply look on as Washington and Dublin take the 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams is president of Sinn Fein, the Irish nationalist party whose military 
wing is the terrorist Irish Republican Army. On Aug. 30 he unexpectedly 
announced a "complete cessation of military operations" by the IRA. On "Larry 
King Live" he was up against Ken Maginnis of the Ulster Unionist Party, who is 
publicly skeptical about Adams' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 One can agree with the London Independent without suggesting for a moment that 
Adams, who will appear today before the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, is 
the most important nationalist leader in Northern Ireland. That distinction, in 
our judgment, belongs to John Hume, president of Northern Ireland's Social 
Democratic and Labor Party, who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by 
members of the European Parliament. Regrettably, few Angelenos have heard of 
Hume or know how he and Adams differ. But what is more regrettable is that 
Adams is speaking today so far from Britain, where there are many potential 
debate opponents who indeed know this difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain has promised that three months after "a permanent end to the use of, 
or support for, paramilitary violence," to quote the 1993 Downing Street 
Declaration, Sinn Fein will be welcome at multilateral negotiations on the 
future of Northern Ireland. Because Adams did not use the word permanent in his 
Aug. 30 announcement, Britain need not begin negotiations on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Prime Minister John Major would serve Britain's interests by taking 
the Independent's point and issuing Adams a visa. President Clinton has lifted 
the ban on political contact between U.S. government officials and 
representatives of Sinn Fein. Major cannot go so far so soon, but surely the 
time has come for informal but public debate to include Adams in Britain as 
well as in the United States.

DEFENSE DOWNSIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Hughes' and now Northrop Grumman's decisions to downsize their work 
force as well as their business potential (Sept. 23): When are the defense 
industries going to realize that their future lies in marketing products to the 
consumer, not to the bloated Pentagon bureaucracy? 
</P>
<P>
 Japan during the '60s, '70s and '80s got rich, filthy rich, by engineering, 
manufacturing and marketing a better automobile, stereo, television, VCR and 
Walkman, while our best engineering minds (Hughes, Northrop) were developing 
bombs, bombers and weapons delivery systems. Get a clue! Diversify! Don't put 
those brilliant scientific and engineering minds in the unemployment line, put 
them into R&D for the next generation of consumer goods.

CHILDREN IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Las Vegas Gambles on Families," Sept. 23, regarding the problem of children 
in Las Vegas casinos, doesn't address the reason for the problem. Despite 
grumblings to the contrary, many of the casino owners are shrewdly cultivating 
their own future clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years from now the kid with the dirty diaper on the floor of the MGM 
Grand will be back at the Grand playing the slots and the tables. After a 
number of visits in his younger years he will have become used to the 
environment and he'll see that Las Vegas is fun. It's a self-perpetuating 
system. Vegas owners are conditioning parents to bring their children to Las 
Vegas for a good time. As soon as the kid becomes 21 he becomes a customer on 
his own. It's like a pyramid.

PERSPECTIVE ON DNA TESTING; IT'S SCIENTIFIC FACT, NOT COURT FICTION; MATCHING 
BLOOD SAMPLES THROUGH GENETIC MARKERS IS RELIABLE, AND CAN PROVE INNOCENCE AS 
WELL AS GUILT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MONES, Paul Mones is a defense attorney and author in Santa Monica. His 
book Stalking Justice, which concerns the Timothy Spencer case, will be 
published next year by Pocketbooks/Simon & Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the day O.J. Simpson was arrested, we have been barraged with arguments 
concerning DNA fingerprinting and its meaning to criminal justice. The tenor of 
this debate has led many to conclude that the technology is as scientific as a 
Ouija board and not much more precise than a divining rod. For the record, 
genetic fingerprinting is a well-established, reliable science that has enjoyed 
the support of scientists throughout the world and has been admitted in many 
courtrooms. Unfortunately, those advocating its use have been drowned out by 
its adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a seemingly mad scramble to cast as much doubt as possible on this 
remarkably accurate tool for placing perpetrators at the scene of a crime. For 
example, in a nationally televised interview aired soon after the commencement 
of the Simpson preliminary hearing, one of the nation's best-known defense 
attorneys pronounced that DNA fingerprinting was a new and untrustworthy 
science. This myth has been repeated until it has regrettably gained a life of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commentators would have the public believe that the technology is 
inherently biased, weighing the odds so heavily in favor of the prosecution 
that every time it is used, a match is found and the defendant convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Such assertions are erroneous and nonsensical. They also ignore the tremendous 
promise that DNA fingerprinting holds for both victims of violent crime and 
those falsely accused and wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Because California courts have not yet fully accepted DNA fingerprinting, many 
have inferred that DNA testing has not gained a foothold anywhere else. Not so. 
For example, the experts paraded on television have ignored the case of Timothy 
Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer was convicted in 1988 for the rapes and murders of four Virginia 
women, solely on the basis of a DNA match between his blood and crime scene 
semen samples. (Coincidentally, Spencer's defense team had the samples 
independently tested by Cellmark Diagnostics, the same lab retained by 
Simpson's prosecutors). Spencer's conviction was upheld by the U.S. Supreme 
Court. This was the first murder conviction in U.S. history based solely on DNA 
fingerprinting. Also, as a result of Spencer's arrest, a man who had been 
charged with a related rape-murder was released after serving five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most disturbing about the drift of the present controversy is its 
obsessive focus on the potential misuse of DNA to convict an innocent man. Why 
not see the other side? DNA will help to exonerate, not convict, an innocent 
person. Moreover, it seems very odd to suggest that those of us who have 
dedicated our lives to championing the rights of the individual care little for 
the power of this technology to let wrongly convicted people, like Frederick 
Rene Daye, go free. Daye, who was convicted in 1984 in San Diego Superior Court 
for rape and kidnaping and spent 10 years in prison, was freed last month after 
DNA tests proved his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The special appeal of DNA testing is its impact on cases of sexual assault. In 
actions where there are neither eyewitnesses nor fingerprints, the justice 
equation boils down to the victim's word against that of the accused. DNA 
fingerprinting offers an invaluable tool for rendering more clearly the issue 
of perpetrator identity in these very sensitive, troubling cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what has now become gospel, DNA fingerprinting is not new. The 
much-discussed RFLP test being used to compare Simpson's blood to samples from 
the crime scene was first used in 1978 to identify differences in DNA 
structure. One of its first practical applications was the study of the genetic 
structure of sickle cell anemia. Today, the basis of this genetic analysis is 
at the heart of amniocentesis. The PCR test has an equally impressive lineage; 
it won its creator the Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 And while discussion does continue over the calculation of the odds in genetic 
fingerprint identification, a deep schism does not exist in the scientific 
community over the validity of the procedure itself. There are close to 100 
articles on DNA fingerprinting in the scientific literature and only about half 
a dozen are critical of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Because scientists and technicians are mortal human beings, there will 
inevitably be errors. Mistakes, however, are not reason to abandon the 
technique. And when such problems arise, especially in a highly publicized 
case, the adversary process will undoubtedly ferret out even the most minor 
miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot and should not run from the future. DNA fingerprinting is a tool 
that can be instrumental in unearthing the truth, justice's goal.

AN INITIATIVE EVEN CONSERVATIVES CAN HATE; PROP. 187: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A 
LIBERAL TO OPPOSE THE DEHUMANIZATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN O'LEARY BENNETT, Brian O'Leary Bennett is a former chief of staff to 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and was a delegate to the 1988 and 1992 
Republican national conventions. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Jan. 11, 1989, President Ronald Reagan delivered a vintage 
lump-in-the-throat final address to the nation. Toward the end he said: "I've 
spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever 
quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall 
proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed and 
teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace . . . and if there 
had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone 
with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it 
still." 
</P>
<P>
 Millions possessed of such "will and heart to get here" are here illegally. 
While it would be unfair to suggest that Reagan advocates illegal immigration 
as a vehicle, he was reminding us in the metaphor he loves most that immigrants 
are innately beneficial to America, notwithstanding legal status. After all, 
there is no human difference between a legal Vietnamese refugee and an illegal 
Haitian or Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, regrettably, it appears that more than a majority of the former 
President's fellow Californians will vote Nov. 8 for Proposition 187, the 
initiative to "save our state" from immigrants here illegally.  
</P>
<P>
 We can argue endlessly about the net effect that illegal aliens have on the 
state's treasury and economy. I happen to believe that they are a net plus. But 
I don't need to be proved wrong to still know that this initiative is wrong. I 
don't condone lawbreaking. I don't believe that illegal aliens are entitled to 
most social benefits. But meat-axing essentials like medical care and 
education, as this initiative proposes, is unsafe, morally suspect, politically 
shortsighted and culturally separatist. 
</P>
<P>
 However unintentional, Proposition 187 subtly attacks the dignity and humanity 
of a defenseless people (particularly from Latin America). It encourages those 
who would equate illegal status with being stupid, lazy, even criminal. 
Proposition 187 would treat these immigrants more severely than felons: Even 
the worst thugs housed in our prisons get vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who believe in the rights of the unborn understand how dangerous 
it is to rely solely on legal status to define how we treat a person. Abortion 
supporters have successfully confused and so far persuaded Americans that the 
unborn are not "legal" persons. The result has been the destruction of 26 
million babies in their mothers' wombs. 
</P>
<P>
 While nothing can compare with the monstrous results of abortion, or slavery 
for that matter, a dangerous precedent is being repeated: Deny legal personhood 
to a class of fellow human beings and you can deny fundamental rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the New Deal, conservatives have criticized the left for using one 
level of government to usurp the prerogatives of another. Yet many 
conservatives now wrongly embrace the state initiative process to affect what 
is clearly a federal responsibility. Securing our borders is the constitutional 
responsibility of the national government, period. Until Washington attaches to 
the protection of our southern border the same diplomatic urgency it rightly 
gave to NAFTA, our border will not be secure. And if Washington won't, pray 
that at least Gov. Wilson's suit succeeds in getting California reimbursed for 
a problem that Washington allowed to mushroom into unmanageability. 
</P>
<P>
 As for having children of illegal immigrants thrown out of school -- what 
possible good can come from that? This is the most shameful aspect of 
Proposition 187. The damage to innocent children will be incalculable in its 
profound and permanent harm to them and to this state's economic and social 
future. We will see spring up among us a generation of ignorant and troubled 
children who, lacking our common language and political and social ideals, will 
evolve into a huge, parallel underclass. This triumph of cultural separatism 
defies common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 We Republicans share so many values with today's immigrants. It has proved a 
winning alliance at the ballot box. Don't be confused by Proposition 187's 
supposed focus on illegal immigrants; it would demean all immigrants. Let us 
not be seen as the anti-immigrant party that my Irish-American Democrat 
grandfather believed it to be. We have accomplished so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, illegal immigrants broke the law. But they are here in great numbers and 
impossible to send back. Better to decide how to deal with them. Certainly, 
turning our schools, businesses and hospitals into INS battlefields is not the 
answer. The border is where our fight ought to be.

AROUND TOWN: BLUE DOG SNIFFS OUT A GOLDEN GOOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hyperbole is thicker than moss in the bayou. "I'm just a po' boy from New 
Iberia, LOOSiana." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next, George Rodrigue will claim to be accompanying a cobalt-blue dog on a 
mystic journey through a never-never land between life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 And, know what? You'll start to believe, at least about the blue dog. (As for 
that poor boy stuff, a flashy Rolex gives the game away.) 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you've seen Blue Dog. That's her, peering through improbably yellow eyes 
from those Absolut Vodka ads. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, here's "Blue Dog," the book. Blue Dog as a Book-of-the-Month Club 
pick. Blue Dog as philosopher. Blue Dog as cash cow. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a high every day. You can't take it too seriously," says artist 
Rodrigue (pronounced Rod-reeg), Blue Dog's creator. He's on a promotional tour, 
signing books at SuperCrown in Glendale, sketching Blue Dog beneath his 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 A boyish 50-year-old given to saying, "Man . . . " (as in, "Man, what a 
dog!"), Rodrigue is too happy to even bristle at any suggestion that Blue Dog 
is no Blue Boy, that the cur is crassly commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I painted Cajuns for 20 years when nobody wanted them, so they can't accuse 
me of painting Blue Dog for the money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Blue Dog didn't come from some paint-by-numbers kit. Rodrigue was 
schooled at the Art Center College of Design. His oils of Cajun folk hang in 
the Louisiana governor's mansion, the residence of the French president and the 
Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks it's a great joke when prospective buyers of Blue Dog paintings say 
to him, "'This is great (but) do you really know what you're doing?" He's quick 
to point out that he knows exactly what he's doing, which rules he's breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrigue calls Blue Dog "Tiffany," the name he gave the real-life Blue Dog 
when she came to him as a black-and-white pup in 1968. She was the reject from 
a friend's litter of terrier-spaniels, a mutt, and he thought a fancy moniker 
would "make her sound expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 years until she died, they were pals. Tiffany snoozed nearby as 
Rodrigue painted in his Lafayette, La., studio. Tiffany never failed to 
retrieve his tattered slippers from the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, illustrating a book of Louisiana ghost stories, he needed a model for 
a mythical werewolf. He pulled out a photo of Tiffany. To make her 
otherworldly, he painted her blue. 
</P>
<P>
 An icon was born. Rodrigue's Blue Dog originals began to sell around Louisiana 
for $300. The big breakthrough came in 1988, when a Blue Dog at a Rodeo Drive 
gallery fetched $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Tiffany was no mutt. Today, an original will set you back about 
$10,000; a print, $900. The craze has launched Blue Dog galleries in Carmel, 
Yokohama and Munich that gross $10,000 daily. To supply them, Rodrigue turns 
out about 200 Blue Dog paintings a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrigue mentions such collectors as Whoopi Goldberg, Meredith and Tom Brokaw, 
Harry Connick Jr., "and a whole bunch of famous people." Hillary Rodham Clinton 
has a print, given to her by the owner of a New Orleans restaurant where she 
admired it. 
</P>
<P>
 Top money paid for top dog was $150,000 on commission from a Canadian 
stockbroker. He wanted Blue Dog painted with a bull and a bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Not content to be the only blue dog in the known world, Tiffany is a 
contributing writer of "Blue Dog," the book (Viking Studio Books), wherein she 
confides it was her idea all along that Rodrigue paint her. This was her dream, 
even as he "ran his fingers over my ears as if I were a stuffed doll." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Rodrigue and writer Lawrence S. Freundlich weave a charming tale 
of the man and dog on a quest for the meaning of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to come back to me," Rodrigue says. "It's so sad. I have to tell 
her she can't." Blue Dog doesn't know she's dead. 
</P>
<P>
 As Blue Dog wanders through the spirit world, Rodrigue paints her with such 
improbably diverse subjects as Marla Maples and Huey Long's bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 He paints her with Elvis -- "Blue Dog thinks Elvis is me because I listened to 
so much Elvis music. She doesn't know Elvis is dead, either." 
</P>
<P>
 And he paints her with nudes (something about her seeking love in all the 
wrong places). He even paints her as Pagliacci, a blue dog with the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Tiffany "never thought she was a dog." Even Rodrigue must wonder. 
"Now that she's died, she's made me more famous and made herself famous. She 
loves it." 
</P>
<P>
 So does he. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the vodka ads. (For the record, Rodrigue doesn't drink. Presumably, 
Blue Dog doesn't either? "That's right.") 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the celebrity. He turned down a million-dollar T-shirt offer from 
the folks who made Spuds McKenzie famous. "I don't want my dog on every T-shirt 
in the country. It insults me and Tiffany." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he's said thanks, but no thanks, to some very famous animators. "This 
is not a cartoon."

 Ditto, a very hot filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't he want to be rich and famous? "I am rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearty laughter.

<P>
 A Naked Cry for Healing 
</P>
<P>
 The happening onstage at Hollywood Moguls might best be called a body of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The house darkens; spotlights play on a black backdrop. Chanting in unison, 
six figures in white sheets enter, looking like a sextet of Roman senators. "In 
the beginning," they intone, "was the word. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they drop the sheets. An ensemble of poets -- starkers, every one. The 
better to present "The Naked Word," a 90-minute speak-out against racism, 
domestic violence and unsafe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an artist's cry for healing in our times," producer-director Kennon 
B. Raines would explain later.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, but does nudity make good poetry better? Bad poetry worse? What's the 
point? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Raines said, some might think it's "just to get people here." True, it 
helps to have a gimmick; poetry is not a big draw. But she suggests a loftier 
motive: 
</P>
<P>
 "The poet's role is always to reveal self -- and hope the world will listen." 
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may dismiss her as "a belligerent nut." She shrugged. But she's shed her 
clothes to get people to look beneath the facade and hear the message. Indeed, 
after a few minutes of bare skin, one's eyes tend to glaze over. 
</P>
<P>
 And, this is no sex show. Some of the four men (the eldest of whom is 83) and 
three women sag and jiggle a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Raines said she had to "beg, bitch and bamboozle" to keep some of the poets in 
the show. But one, Mark Pomeroy, said he's comfortable out there: "Poets are 
self-exposing sorts of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the audience were at first a bit uneasy. Keli Morgan, a poet herself, 
said, "These people are our friends. Three-fourths of them I've heard with 
their clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she thought one or two solo performances "took on a poignancy, a 
vulnerability" through nakedness. She added: "I know how hard (going out there) 
is, even with my clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up the quality of the poetry, another patron said, "From god-awful to 
incredibly moving." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Morgan wondered: "What are they going to tell their 
grandchildren?' 
</P>
<P>
 "The Naked Word" will be performed at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at Hollywood Moguls, 
1650 Schrader. * This weekly column chronicles the people and small moments 
that define life in Southern California. Reader suggestions are welcome.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; ALL-AROUND EFFORTS TO MAKE SAFETY A SIDE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air bags and seat belts are considered essential equipment by drivers 
concerned about the survivability of frontal crashes. But attention is 
increasingly turning to how well new cars protect occupants in side-impact 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for improved side-impact safety seems compelling. About 8,800 deaths 
occur annually as the result of side-impact collisions, second only to the 
roughly 15,000 annual deaths from frontal crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers began including side-impact beams in car doors in the '70s, a 
vastly overrated improvement that yielded little real protection for front-seat 
passengers, said independent safety experts including the Insurance Institute 
for Highway Safety. (Rear-seat occupants are better protected in a side 
collision by the car's structure and have a lower fatality rate.) 
</P>
<P>
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a 
requirement called the dynamic side-impact standard in the late 1980s. It 
required auto makers to design doors that would better protect passengers from 
the intrusion of car parts and structure in side impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The new standard will be phased in over four years so that by the 1997 model 
year, all new cars (not trucks) will have to pass a test equivalent to their 
being broadsided traveling at 15 m.p.h. by a vehicle moving 30 m.p.h. But the 
standard is primarily intended to prevent abdominal and chest injuries. It does 
not attempt to mitigate head injuries, which some experts consider the leading 
cause of side-impact death. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHTSA is developing such a standard, though devising a rule and test 
procedure is as complex as developing the safety improvements in the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some manufacturers are racing ahead of federal requirements. Volvo introduced 
standard side-impact air bags in its 850 Turbo models for 1995. The system has 
a percussion cap that detonates upon impact and inflates a 12-liter bag in 
about 12-thousandths of a second. These are smaller than dashboard air bags and 
operate differently. Dashboard air bags are activated by rapid deceleration, 
not impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit 
consumer-protection group in Washington, D.C., questions the effectiveness of 
side air bags in the absence of any federal standards. Door pillars of steel in 
concentric hollow tubes to cushion head impacts, for example, may prove to be 
an effective, lower-cost solution, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many models already meet the new dynamic impact standard to prevent 
head and chest injuries, including the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Chevrolet 
Lumina and Dodge Intrepid. A full listing can be obtained from the Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety by writing: Shopping for a Safer Car, P.O. Box 
1420, Arlington, Va. 22210. Enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope.

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; YOU, TOO, CAN PLAY WEATHER REPORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After several hours at the computer trying to beat the last level of "Doom," 
you might get the urge to check out what's happening in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, you had to either let that urge pass or actually get up from 
your chair and go outside. 
</P>
<P>
 But no more. Now, if you have a modem, there is an astonishing amount of 
up-to-date weather information that can be accessed through on-line services. 
And if you have access via your workplace or school to the Internet, you can 
get worldwide weather maps, satellite pictures, forecasts and more technical 
meteorological data than you probably care about for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to obtain weather information on-line is through the 
commercial services. On CompuServe, you simply click on the little weather icon 
(if you're using one of their handy graphic interfaces -- otherwise, you just 
write "go weather") and up pops the current forecast for the area you choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose Los Angeles, for example, and you get separate forecasts from the 
National Weather Service for the Downtown/beach areas and the San Fernando/San 
Gabriel valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The day this column appears, according to that forecast, it's supposed to be 
mostly clear with light winds and highs ranging from the mid 70s at the beaches 
to the 80s in the valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe also provides a "Climatological Report," showing current weather 
conditions and bits of historical information, including the record highs and 
lows for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 For cities outside the United States, CompuServe gives you access to forecasts 
made by the commercial Accu-Weather service (it's supposed to be partly sunny 
today in Tokyo with a high of 84). 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just the beginning of CompuServe's justifiably heralded weather 
features. You can also get printouts of extended forecasts, weather alerts, 
precipitation probability charts, marine forecasts for boaters and (for an 
extra fee) aviation forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you can view numerous weather maps and satellite pictures that are 
updated regularly. From a satellite in geostationary orbit that allows a 
constant view of the southwestern United States, came pictures earlier this 
week clearly showing the clouds that brought us welcome rain showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather information is also available on America On Line, but it's neither as 
detailed nor as easy to find or view. Maps and satellite pictures must be 
downloaded to your computer before you can view them. 
</P>
<P>
 AOL does have a lively weather discussion area for the truly climatologically 
obsessed. Recent messages included a debate about what area of the United 
States has the worst weather (Mt. Washington, N.H., got a lot of votes) and the 
best (many nominated San Diego). There were also numerous weather jokes 
including the old standby about the forecast for South America ("Chile today 
and hot tamale") and several of the it-was-so-cold variety ("It was so cold in 
D.C. that the politicians had their hands in their own pockets!"). Let's move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to work a bit to get weather info on the Internet, but if you are 
fascinated by the topic, it is certainly the place to be. The best known spot 
is the "Weather Machine" area maintained by the University of Illinois and 
founded with grants from the National Science Foundation and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at that Internet site, I was able to get detailed National Weather 
Service forecasts for the Los Angeles area, plus a climatological summary that 
included accumulated precipitation for the season as compared to past seasons 
(especially important data for us in Southern California). There were also 
extended forecasts, a visibility report, wind advisories and marine summaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Weather Machine" also offers an ample variety of weather maps, satellite 
pictures, radar images and surface pictures. In its archives are pictures of 
hurricanes and other major events. 
</P>
<P>
 With the appropriate on-line search tools, you can then travel from Illinois 
to weather information sites around the world on the Internet, including 
European sites where you can download spectacular images from the Meteosat 
satellite that are processed by the Department of Meteorology at the University 
of Edinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 You can spend so many hours exploring the weather of the world that you might 
even temporarily forget about "Doom." You need never leave the house again.

INK: BANTAM DOUBLEDAY DELL FINDS ROOM TO GROW

<P>
 Dramatic expansion has been announced by one of the book industry's largest 
corporations. A fourth general-interest publishing division is being built from 
scratch within the Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The as-yet-unnamed operation will be led by William Shinker, who most recently 
worked in Rupert Murdoch's book line as HarperCollins' head of adult trade 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinker's new venture will concentrate on nonfiction, to be published in 
hardcover and trade-paperback editions beginning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let's Pick on Oprah: As Oprah Winfrey's fans await the autobiography she 
postponed indefinitely last year, an unauthorized bio of the TV talk-show host 
and a cookbook she endorsed (Rosie Daley's "In the Kitchen With Rosie") have 
both enjoyed strong sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes word that Tom Shales, the Pulitzer Prize-winning TV critic of the 
Washington Post, will weigh in with a book about the diva of daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 Shales will explore "the meaning of Oprah and what it tells us about 
ourselves," according to senior editor Claire Wachtel, who is handling the book 
at William Morrow & Co. Publication is set for next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * All About Oswald: Norman Mailer's next book has the working title of "Oswald 
in Minsk," although Random House Publisher Harold M. Evans says he wanted to 
call the book "Oswald's Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, it promises to expand mightily on what we know of Lee Harvey 
Oswald, the presumed assassin of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer's "portrait of deviation" (Evans' words) draws on the author's fruitful 
visit to Minsk, where the local office of the KGB obligingly laid out the files 
on Oswald that it amassed when the American defector was living in the city 
with his Russian wife, Marina. The trove included tapes of bugged conversations 
between the couple and helped swell Mailer's book by a third, to an expected 
800 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Publication is scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bigger and Better: The National Times, a magazine that gathers previously 
published news and commentary, has re-emerged in bookstores and on newsstands 
in a standard-size, more cleanly designed format. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff, led by editor and publisher David Krebs, a former manager of 
Aerosmith and other rock 'n' roll acts who now heads Krebs Media Corp. in New 
York, has cast a wide net for the pieces appearing in the re-launch. The topics 
range from foreign affairs to the arts to technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a bimonthly, the magazine, aimed at readers on the go, is scheduled to 
become a monthly in February. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer, Eastman Kodak, Time-Warner -- and the rest of the top 16 
publicly traded companies that offer health-insurance benefits to the domestic 
partners of gay and lesbian employees -- are listed in the October issue of 
Victory! Billing itself as the "national gay & lesbian entrepreneur magazine," 
the fledgling, business-oriented Victory! is published monthly by Intercultural 
Science Group in Sacramento. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Light, who had been acting editor in chief of Vibe magazine, is now 
officially editor in chief. The hip-hop music and lifestyle magazine published 
by Time Inc. Ventures plans to increase the circulation it will guarantee to 
advertisers -- the so-called rate base -- to 250,000 next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul D. Colford's column is published Fridays.

BOOK REVIEW / SCIENCE; A GUIDED TRIP THROUGH THE HUMAN BRAIN; DESCARTES' ERROR: 
EMOTION, REASON, AND THE HUMAN BRAIN BY ANTONIO R. DAMASIO ; GROSSET/PUTNAM 
$24.95, 313 PAGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1848, 25-year-old Phineas P. Gage, foreman of a crew laying track for the 
Rutland & Burlington Vermont railroad, turned his head for a second while 
preparing to set off a blast. That was a mistake. The explosive misfired, 
hurling Gage's narrow 3 1/2-foot iron tamping rod into his cheek and out 
through the top of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Gage died, this story would not have entered into history. But Gage, who 
was thrown on his back by the impact, was soon walking and talking as if little 
had happened, despite his gaping wound. Yet something had happened and 
co-workers soon observed that "Gage was no longer Gage." 
</P>
<P>
 Foul language came to dominate his speech, and the attending doctor noted that 
the "equilibrium or balance between his intellectual faculty and animal 
propensities" was gone. Destitute, unable to hold jobs or friends, he joined a 
circus freak show for awhile and eventually moved in with his mother in San 
Francisco. Then he developed seizures and died in 1861. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio R. Damasio, head of neurology at the University of Iowa's medical 
school and an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute, introduces Gage at the 
book's beginning. Thanks to the detective work of Damasio's colleague and 
neurobiologist wife, Hannah, Gage's tragedy has helped illuminate the 
complicated nature of human reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah Damasio combined measurements of Gage's skull -- which had been 
preserved as a curiosity at the Harvard Medical School's museum -- with 
"Brainvox," a magnetic resonance imaging process that constructed a 3-D image 
of Gage's brain with the metal rod piercing the frontal lobes. 
</P>
<P>
 By knowing which part of the brain was destroyed, Antonio Damasio was able to 
compare Gage's prefrontal damage and subsequent personality changes with 
similar results observed in his own patients, especially in a man he calls 
Elliot. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a good husband and father, Elliot complained of headaches and then seemed 
to lose his concentration and sense of responsibility. He took a battery of 
psychological tests. They showed nothing. Elliot was coherent and smart with a 
flawless memory of his life story. He was referred to Antonio Damasio, who 
found a brain tumor pressing on Elliot's frontal lobes. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery was essential and although Damasio was able to remove the tumor, 
Elliot's behavior began to resemble Gage's. Unlike Gage, however, Elliot was 
there for Damasio to study. 
</P>
<P>
 From Elliot, we learn to question our cultural admonitions to "keep a cool 
head" and "separate emotions from reason." Emotion is an intrinsic part of 
intelligence, Elliot's case reveals; having lost access to the part of his 
brain that provides emotional cues, Elliot could not make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gage's and Elliot's stories lead Damasio into a remarkable discussion of the 
way memory and reason work. He deduces, for instance, that there is no single 
brain center. The summoning-up of a memory activates several brain systems 
working in concert on many levels. This helps confirm Damasio's hypothesis that 
mind and body are connected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Descartes' Error," of course, was his separation of the mind from the body. 
Damasio succeeds in defending the mind-body unity in this well-written 
discussion. He describes what is known about the brain today, from the areas 
first mapped in the 19th Century to "the two principal routes of 
interconnection" we now understand. These are the sensory and motor nerves that 
carry signals from every part of the body to and from the brain, and the 
bloodstream that circulates chemical signals, including hormones, 
neurotransmitters and modulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Damasio's more remarkable observations is that the brain always changes. 
Data from experience (or memory) exists in many places in the brain, and may 
even disappear because the brain is not a giant file cabinet. There are no hard 
copies of memories. Nor is it like a computer where the brain is hardware and 
the mind software. The brain lives in a feedback loop with the rest of the 
body, which makes it highly improbable that a brain could exist without a body 
(a favorite science-fiction theme). 
</P>
<P>
 Each time we recollect something, Damasio tells us, our brain collects data 
from different sites and pulls the information together. Always subject to 
editing and reconstruction, our pasts exist in a "potential state, subject to 
activation, like the town of Brigadoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich in provocative concepts about intelligence, memory, creativity and even 
passion, "Descartes' Error" is an excellent guide to the revelations of 
neurobiology.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: BRITISH, YES, BUT WE LOVED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Wednesday's opening-night performance of the Royal National Theatre 
company's "Racing Demon" at the Doolittle Theatre. A party followed at the 
Hollywood Roosevelt hotel. The play is part of the UK/LA Festival, the British 
cultural bash. 
</P>
<P>
 When Prince Charles Arrives, He'll Explain It: Asked about the festival, the 
play's British director, Richard Eyre, said, "Excuse me, I don't mean to be 
unpatriotic, but what exactly is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: No matter how great the production, theater does not get a 
massive turnout. Among the 1,000 at the play (300 at the party) were James 
Doolittle, Gordon Davidson, Candice Bergen and husband Louis Malle, Anita and 
Louis Nye, Nancy Livingston, Samantha Eggar and performance artist Rachel 
Rosenthal whose remark about theater in Los Angeles was: "It's like when you 
put a veneer on something and it doesn't stick. But you keep putting it on year 
after year." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Lead actor Oliver Ford Davies, on opening in Los Angeles after doing 
the play for four years in London: "All first nights are terrifying. But when 
you've been doing a play for a long time, it's really a feeling of 'supposing 
for some reason we don't do it at our best.' I'd just be very, very angry with 
myself. And I won't know why. That's one of the maddening things about being an 
actor. You don't know why you're good one night and not so good another." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Homecoming: Playwright David Hare said he first came to L.A. at the age 
of 17. "It was fantastic. England was still pre-Beatles, sort of 
pre-revolution. It was a very cold, repressed, miserable country. So to come 
here, and find all these people with their jeans cut off and having such a 
wonderful sybaritic life was liberation for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cast Nervousness: The main fear the company had, Hare said, is that the 
Anglican church, the subject of the play, "is for a large part of the Los 
Angeles population a very distant subject." Co-star Alastair Galbraith's dry 
comment was: "We knew there wasn't a Church of England cable channel here." The 
audience loved it.

R S V P; BLASTING BACK TO THE PAST IN CELEBRATION OF MUSIC 
</P>

 It was back to the '30s, even though many at the Los Angeles Junior 
Philharmonic gala had never been there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember the '30s, because I wasn't born until 1939, but I do 
remember the music, because my parents played all their old records," said 
Joseph LaBonte, honoree at the dinner-dance Wednesday night at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1934, the Junior Philharmonic Committee's focus is on music 
education for children, through the Music Mobile and Symphonies for Youth 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte, chairman of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn., recalled how his love 
of music had been fostered not just at home, but also at school. "It's a little 
scary now, when children in our schools don't get introduced to music," he 
said, stressing in his acceptance speech the importance of outreach to young 
music lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Esa-Pekka Salonen, the philharmonic's music director, thanked LaBonte for 
having "the strength and power to fight for quality." Salonen also said the 
quality of his orchestra stems not only from the wonderful musicians but from 
"the people who believe in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Before dinner, the cocktail reception and silent auction occupied the crowd -- 
which included Dolly Gillin, Shauna Trabert with Karl Honeystein, Caroline 
Ahmanson, Erna Schulhofer and L.A. Philharmonic Managing Director Ernest 
Fleischmann, who eschewed the conventional black tie for a clerical-style 
collar that set him apart from the laity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This all looks so glamorous," LaBonte said, surveying the ballroom's mirrored 
walls that reflected the opulence of dining tables adorned with lush, 
sweet-smelling floral centerpieces.

 "But I know how hard these ladies work to put on these events," LaBonte added. 
"I've seen the broken nails, the grungy T-shirts, the long hours behind this 
elegance." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-working ladies, with not a broken nail in sight, included gala 
chairwoman Diane Dykema and Junior Philharmonic Committee President Katherine 
Dagermangy. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment included a re-creation of a '30s-style radio show by the group 
Vocalworks. Then Rosemary Clooney took a sentimental journey to all the 
familiar places with such numbers as "Our Love Is Here to Stay" and her 1951 
hit "Come On-a My House."

AH, THE POWERFUL LURE OF THE FREEBIE; POLITICS: HISTORY IS FULL OF 
WASHINGTONIANS WHO MISUSE THE PRIVILEGES OF POWER. BUT IS IT CORRUPTION OR 
PLAIN OLD SLOPPINESS?

<P>
 Mike Espy, as they say, had everything going for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The first African American elected to Congress from Mississippi since 
Reconstruction, the youngest member of the Clinton Cabinet, he was getting good 
marks as Agriculture Secretary until, investigators say, he started accepting 
small favors from Tyson Foods Inc., the giant poultry processor his department 
is supposed to regulate. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Espy, who resigned Monday effective Dec. 31, joined the ranks of 
supposedly savvy politicians who, in the harsh klieg lights of Washington, 
proved themselves not ready for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 From Sherman Adams, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's chief aide, who received 
an infamous vicuna coat, to President George Bush's Chief of Staff John Sununu, 
who used military transportation to go to stamp shows and the dentist, 
Washington history is replete with once powerful people who overstepped the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly common problem that you generally see at the beginning of every 
Administration as people come in from the outside," said Marlin Fitzwater, a 
Washington veteran who was Bush's press secretary. "In the business and the 
academic world, these things (free trips and the like) are a recognized form of 
compensation." 
</P>
<P>
 Such freebies have also been characteristic of the Congress, where Espy served 
into a fourth term before resigning to take the agriculture post. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Washington hands have suggested that his downfall resulted from 
bringing his Congressional ethics, or lack thereof, with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to the executive branch via the legislative branch and did not 
realize that the easy virtue of a legislator would have to change," theorized 
Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of scrutiny you get in the executive branch at a high level is 
unique," Hess continued. "It doesn't come to businessmen, university professors 
or even congressmen by and large." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Espy affair is atypical, said longtime lobbyist Tom Korologos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys who get in trouble in this town are the ones who've never been here 
before. Suddenly, they have an official car, they eat in the White House mess 
and go to the Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why this Espy thing is so mysterious," Korologos said. "I don't 
understand how a pro like him could get in trouble like this. Maybe he's the 
exception that proves the rule." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan Administration holds the modern record for appointees who slipped 
up on ethical or other grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 National Security Adviser Richard Allen had to make a quick exit in 1981 after 
it was revealed that he took $1,000 from Japanese journalists seeking an 
interview with Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 And who can forget Interior Secretary James Watt's 1983 boast that he had 
appointed "a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple" to an advisory commission 
-- a comment that even in those politically less correct days had him cleaning 
out his desk forthwith. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan's first Attorney General, William French Smith, resigned under press 
criticism for personal tax matters. His successor, Edwin Meese, survived almost 
until the end of Reagan's second term but was under almost continual 
investigation because of accusations of corruption and conflicts of interest; 
he was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan Administration also holds the dubious distinction of being the only 
one to have had a Cabinet member step down because of a criminal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 charges against Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan predated his 
Washington days. Donovan, a former New Jersey construction company executive, 
was alleged to have defrauded New York City of more than $7 million on a subway 
project. He was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton promised during his campaign to "do better" than the 
Republicans on ethical as well as policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
 So when longtime Arkansas friend David Watkins was revealed last summer to 
have used the President's helicopter twice to go play golf -- at a cost to the 
taxpayers of more than $13,000 -- he was forced out as White House director of 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, government officials confirmed that General Services Administration 
chief Roger W. Johnson, former chairman of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine, is 
under investigation for the second time in his tenure over allegations that he 
misused his government position for personal benefit. An agency spokeswoman 
attributed it to "unfamiliarity with the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 White House overzealousness in attempting to contain the Whitewater affair has 
caused the most casualties, among them White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum and 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, another political pro and Friend of Bill who, like Espy, seemed to 
have everything going for him, was caught telling less than the whole truth 
about his Whitewater dealings to the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the irony of the fact that several of his chief accusers have 
themselves been investigated for alleged ethical misconduct, Altman, a former 
Wall Street executive and Treasury official under President Jimmy Carter, is 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his boss, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, a former Senator and 
the archetypal Washington old hand, whom Altman had apparently expected to 
replace, remains firmly entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes those who self-destruct from the likes of Bentsen or former 
White House counsel Lloyd Cutler, whose Washington shelf life seems to go on 
forever? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are very narcissistic and entitled and feel they deserve to be in 
a power position and don't need to hold to the same rules that others do," said 
Dr. Susan J. Fiester, a psychiatrist who gained her own measure of fame when 
she aided in the defense of the knife-wielding Lorena Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 While declining to characterize Espy or others she has not met, Fiester said 
that some politicians, like people in other fields, have a hard time setting 
boundaries for personal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole bunch of people who are personally corrupt," she said. "On 
the other hand, some people are just sloppy."

A HARD FALL FROM GRACE; HE ONCE HAD IT ALL--A GOOD JOB, MONEY, POWER. NOW HE'S 
HOMELESS. WHAT HAPPENED TO TERRY MCKELVEY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUANE NORIYUKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The white-haired man carries extra clothes in a plastic bucket as he weaves 
his way down bustling Broadway. Sometimes he pushes a shopping cart or totes 
plastic bags, but the bucket can be used for a stool should his back begin to 
ache. 
</P>
<P>
 His pace is hectic, as if he were late for a flight or important business 
meeting. His thoughts are equally rushed -- even his words cannot keep up. He 
has no particular appointment, no deadline. Still he races forward. He pauses 
in front of the stately Bradbury Building and approaches slowly, like a 
cautious stranger. Standing beneath its arched entryway, he peers through the 
thick, dark glass, lifting a hand to his forehead to cut the midday glare. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, he managed this five-story building at the corner of 3rd Street 
and Broadway while it was owned by Western Management Corp., founded during the 
Depression by his father with $200. Built in 1893, the Romanesque-style 
Bradbury now is a state historical landmark. It has aged gracefully -- more so 
than the man, now 59. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he walked into the building, he was 7. He recalls taking the 
open-cage elevator to the top floor, looking down at the floor of the open 
inner court and tossing a piece of paper over the railing and watching it 
flutter away. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed since then, much has fluttered away. And now for Terry 
McKelvey, it is all gone: the Bradbury, the Newport Beach properties, the $1.2 
million, the boats, including the 75-foot Discovery. He lives on the streets in 
Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, family members say, they warned him that drinking would devour him. 
They also say they witnessed symptoms of manic depression in McKelvey -- 
expansiveness, unwarranted optimism, grandiosity, lack of judgment. He has 
never cooperated in treatment and has never been diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manic depression is where you're real up and then depressed," McKelvey says. 
"The thing is with me, I'm very energetic, very optimistic, but sometimes I get 
down, especially after I have some beers, but I don't get all depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 He drinks only beer, he says -- not hard liquor -- and he "burns it up" real 
fast. When he is flat broke, he drinks only coffee and water. By his own 
definition, he is not an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking, however, has caused him problems. Department of Motor Vehicle 
records show two convictions in 1991 for driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to pinpoint when McKelvey's life began to change. As a child he 
lived in modest homes on West 77th Street and in West Adams Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 He was drawn to the beach, where he learned to surf and eventually became a 
lifeguard. The ocean was more than a playground, it was a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't argue with the surf," he likes to say. "You see what that wave's 
gonna do. If you look, you can see how it's shaping, and you make your moves. 
The wave's in charge. You try to argue with that wave, and you're gonna get 
roughed up. That's the way I look at life. I surf it." 
</P>
<P>
 He has always been an adventurer. When he was no more than 4 years old, he set 
out one day to explore the world with a wagon filled with stuffed animals. He 
walked out of the front yard of the family home in Los Angeles, and the police 
finally caught up with him and his merry band of teddy bears a mile away. From 
that point on, the front gate was locked. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when he sees his life now as just another adventure, another 
of life's waves, this one carrying him to a land of urban nomads and cardboard 
homes. He sometimes looks at Skid Row as if he were merely a visitor doing 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, however, he feels as though once again the gate has been locked 
on him, leaving him a star-crossed denizen, caged inside something dark and 
deep and terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unlikely turn of events for someone who majored in business 
administration at USC, where he was president of his fraternity and honored for 
overall student achievement. In 1959, a year after graduation, he married. He 
and his wife had four children, all of whom grew up to be college graduates. He 
has an 8-year-old daughter by the second of his three marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a disastrous thing for someone at my age," he says. "I don't know 
what my little girl will think of me. Here's a dad that was sitting on top of 
the heap, living in Newport Beach right on the water, had a home. . . . I just 
lost it, that's all. I lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who love him wonder how much farther there is to fall, believing that 
only when he can fall no more will he begin turning his life around. They have 
tried to reach out to him, but McKelvey -- who tends to blame others for his 
descent -- has rejected outsiders' attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his oldest daughter, Laura McKelvey, 31, who became "the rock of the 
family" after his mother's death in 1991, McKelvey says. "She and I have always 
been close. She told me once I was her best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 For Laura, who sells real estate in Newport Beach, it is too painful, she 
says, to talk about her father, this stranger she now calls Terry instead of 
Daddy. She has taken a "tough love" stance to ease the pain of teetering on the 
edge of hope, only to be punched in the gut again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like he dies and comes back over and over again," she says. "When he 
finally makes up his mind that he truly wants help, you bet I'll be there for 
him. We all will. Until then, there's nothing we can do but pray." 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Paul McKelvey, 33, owns a construction company in Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't a day that he doesn't think about his father, the heartbreak and 
the anger. There was a time when those feelings consumed him. He has a wife and 
two children now, a prospering business, and he must focus on what he can do 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 He has drawn a line through his life, an impossibly difficult one to draw. His 
father is on one side, his family on the other. In his prayers, they are all 
together again. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry McKelvey spends much of his time at the Downtown public library, where 
he has been reading up on Teddy Roosevelt and Coca-Cola. He showers and eats at 
the missions, has secret spots away from Skid Row where he sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Living outside is not so bad, he says, but it can be dangerous. The only time 
he feels truly vulnerable is when he is in a deep sleep, which is why he keeps 
a knife or screwdriver or rocks the size of hockey pucks close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He is pushed forward by credulity, the belief that he will pull out of this 
tailspin on his own terms. He will get rich quick off his inventions, return to 
steer the Bradbury. He will revive Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party and run for 
lieutenant governor, he will recover his boats, give public seminars, start new 
businesses. He will return to USC to play football, rekindle his third 
marriage. That is his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In his mind, he hears magical words. 
</P>
<P>
 "McKelvey is back." 
</P>
<P>
 He turns slowly from the Bradbury and continues down Broadway -- a longing in 
his heart, a plan in mind, a bucket in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he sits on a Downtown park bench, his hands are swollen and sore, probably 
the result of a fracas involving a parking lot attendant. His smile is missing 
a tooth; the sun has turned his skin dark and tough, irritated by a case of 
scabies. 
</P>
<P>
 McKelvey begins telling his story, as usual, from the middle. He managed the 
Bradbury from 1969 until 1986, when he parted ways with Western Management. In 
1989, the building was sold. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains bitter about losing the Bradbury, saying he had planned on making 
it his life. From the buyout of his lease and stock, McKelvey left Western 
Management with $1.2 million in addition to his two Newport Beach homes, which, 
according to 1987 divorce records from his second marriage, were valued at 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the Bradbury, he says he sold his homes and soaked nearly all 
his money into three boats: two 30-foot fishing vessels and the 75-foot, 50-ton 
Discovery, a replica of a 1781 British battleship named the Rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have retired and never worked another day in my life, but I chose not 
to, and I bought these boats, and boy have I run into trouble on the 
waterfront. But I'm up to it and I can take it. I have very thick bones. I used 
to drink a lot of milk when I was little." 
</P>
<P>
 McKelvey intended to use the vessels in a charter business. He also bought a 
photocopy service in Costa Mesa, but both ended up draining him financially. 
What was left of the money disappeared quickly. His third marriage began 
unraveling, and in 1987 he started living on the boats during winter, opting 
for the streets of San Pedro with the clemency of spring. 
</P>
<P>
 He began trawling trash bins for scraps of food and aluminum cans. He grew a 
beard and started dressing in black. He called it his Dr. Death uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 People in the marinas were complaining about his boats being littered with 
filth and attracting an unscrupulous crowd. Eventually, he got behind on his 
slip fees, liens were filed and the boats were taken for auction. 
</P>
<P>
 McKelvey says that the waterfront became vicious and that he was clubbed in 
the head one night. Last April 8, he hopped on a bus for Downtown, intending to 
file a lawsuit against a dock master. He went to the Los Angeles County 
Courthouse but became frustrated with the process, so he left. 
</P>
<P>
 A spate of memories washed over him as he wandered through Downtown. He 
remembered when he was a child and his Aunt Edith brought him to lunch at 
Clifton's. He remembered the buildings he managed, places he worked. He 
remembered the Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly by process of elimination, partly because of fatigue and partly because 
of the lingering warmth of those better days, he decided to stay. After a few 
nights in a shelter, he opted for sleeping outdoors. (In 1992, it was estimated 
that on any given night in L.A., there were up to 40,000 people who are 
homeless, about the same as the population of Culver City.) 
</P>
<P>
 A nocturnal rain splattered the streets not long after he arrived in April, 
and he migrated instinctively like a Canada goose to somewhere warm and safe. 
He curled up, closed his eyes and fell asleep on the side entrance of the 
Bradbury Building. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Chessler operated a telephone answering service and served as McKelvey's 
assistant at the Pershing Square Building and the Bradbury. She has known him 
since the late 1960s. Now the owner of a small print shop near the corner of 
2nd Street and Broadway, she recalls the day last spring when a man walked into 
her shop and stared at her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know who I am, don't you?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when he told me his name I knew right away it was Terry. I could tell he 
was a street person. He was dirty and his hair wasn't combed, and he didn't 
shave," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Chessler is a kind-hearted woman, and she, too, has lived a tough life. Her 
son died at 15 in a motorcycle crash, a daughter died three years ago of 
leukemia. Her husband died of a heart attack. She knows what it is to feel 
despair. 
</P>
<P>
 She allows McKelvey to store some of his things in her shop, use the telephone 
and bathroom, make copies of his sometimes voluminous, rambling prose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have respect for him, because I know what kind of a person he was," 
Chessler says. "He was a good manager, and he kept everything going. He had a 
lot of people working for him who wouldn't otherwise have jobs. In that regard, 
he helped a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 McKelvey went into "semi-retirement" in 1977, spending less time at the 
Bradbury and more time at home or at the beach in Newport, tinkering with 
inventions, surfing, working on "tear-down" properties and fixing them up. 
</P>
<P>
 He implemented a concept he called the "free and open corporation" at the 
Bradbury -- hiring young people, many of them high school dropouts, to run 
their own businesses. They were made owners, sharing equally in profits or 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The program grew to about 40 employees and more than a dozen small businesses. 
McKelvey reached the point where he was reporting to work only a couple of 
times a month to sign checks and gather his flock around him for lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always in command," Chessler says, "and quite capable of everything he 
was doing. I don't think he was quite as kind as he lets on, because people did 
have problems with him. He kind of avoided those he was having problems with." 
</P>
<P>
 He was always creative, once inventing a simple toboggan he sold to Sears and 
Roebuck and a line of novelty items for children. He would design outlandish 
costumes for parties. He and his first wife once dressed as an eight-legged 
spider, waiting at the front door for someone to arrive and ring the doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in his business dealings, there were moments of creative brilliance. Over 
lunch one day, he sold the air rights over the Bradbury for more than $1 
million. The money was used to pay for seismic work on the building. 
</P>
<P>
 He hired his son away from General Dynamics to take on the job, which launched 
Paul McKelvey's business in seismic work and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when Chessler, now 71, has to ask McKelvey to leave her shop 
when it is crowded and he is disruptive, but she says she could never totally 
turn her back on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in God, and God says that what you do for the least of these, you 
do for me, so I keep telling myself I have to keep doing it. They're all God's 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Paul McKelvey, Terry's oldest child and only son, it is difficult to have 
hope, but it is impossible to give up. The ghost of his father is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about him every day," Paul McKelvey says. "Yesterday, I had an 
appointment on the 34th floor of the AT&T Building -- dressed up in suit and 
tie, business is going well. To realize that within a mile radius, that my 
father is out there living in the streets and there's no way of doing anything 
about it, is a wild feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving in, I should be thinking about all the details of the meeting that 
are going to come up. That wasn't on my mind. What happens if I pull out of a 
parking lot and there he is? What would I do? I don't know if I could keep 
driving. I don't think I could. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened once here in Redlands about six months ago. I was driving down 
the street and there was a homeless guy walking down the street pushing a cart, 
and he had the same hair as my father. I immediately pulled into a parking lot, 
got out, started to walk slowly -- kind of apprehensively -- as this guy was 
walking up. I was walking toward him, and I didn't know what I was going to do. 
I didn't know. I got a look at his face and it wasn't him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, what would I have done, stick out my hand, 'How ya been Dad?' Put him 
in the car and get him showered and something to eat? That wouldn't play out. 
That's not real. If I said that to him, it wouldn't be realistic. So, what do 
you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Terry McKelvey became homeless, his brother, Alden McKelvey, 
formerly a minister and the ex-president of Western Management, chaired the 
Skid Row Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In a July 2, 1988, letter to The Times in response to an editorial, Alden 
McKelvey wrote that society can only provide shelters and services for the 
homeless. It cannot force their use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Transition House has sheltered nearly 5,000 men and women in the five years 
of its existence. The legitimate needs of the truly homeless are serious. Let's 
not let emotion allow dropouts to run our city. Shelter is available. But 
often, because it comes with 'rules' -- e.g. '10 p.m. curfew, tidiness 
requirements and clean-up duties,' many of the so-called homeless have just 
chosen not to use what is available." 
</P>
<P>
 Alden McKelvey, who now lives in the Channel Islands, says he never dreamed he 
would be writing about his own family. He, too, hopes his brother begins to 
repair his life. And if that happens, he, too, will be there to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds cruel, but maybe the best thing you can do is help them hit bottom, 
so they can begin to rebuild. That's the time to reach out to someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McKelvey says he fears there will come a telephone call some day or night 
from the coroner. Or worse, that his father might simply disappear. What should 
happen, he asks, if there is no bottom to this fall? 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a grandson in there taking a nap right now who he hasn't even seen, 
probably doesn't even know about. He has caused a lot of pain to a lot of 
people, but that's not what I hang onto," he says. "I hang onto the joys and 
the love." 
</P>
<P>
 The memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him as being the most fun dad on the block. He taught me to surf 
when I was just a little kid. He was absolutely the oldest guy out there on a 
surfboard by 20 years. I was real proud of that, and my friends thought it was 
cool that Mr. McKelvey would take us surfing to take early-morning runs down in 
the trestles. He was a dad who was your buddy too." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it would hurt less now if he had been a mean, uncaring father. Paul 
was 13 when his parents divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rough divorce, but he always stood by us, absolutely stood by us. He 
didn't settle for every other weekend with the kids. He wanted us to know that 
our dad was just down the street. He got an apartment that was a bicycle ride 
away from the school." 
</P>
<P>
 He was filled with hugs and support, never raised a hand to his children, Paul 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't drinking much then. He would take a six-pack -- he called them 
beach Cokes -- and pour the beer into a soda can so the police wouldn't bother 
him. He never came home drunk. It wasn't until later that it was obvious he had 
a drinking problem -- a case a day, then two cases a day. The drinking had a 
huge effect on him. That started when I was in my early 20s." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire family has tried to help, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would sit down with him individually, in pairs, as a group. Then, 
ultimately, as a family we would hire people to help us, professionals who 
would intervene and that didn't work. We started to look at what social 
services were out there, what legal means there were to help him." 
</P>
<P>
 He says the family would gladly pay for treatment, housing, anything that 
would help McKelvey get better. That is what family members do for each other. 
That is what a family is. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's Terry now. We want our father back. We want to help him. We want to say 
to him, 'OK, Dad, we're all together again. It's going to be all right. Let's 
all get well together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In December, it will be two years since he last saw his father. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Terry McKelvey has a plan for getting off Skid Row. Step One involves getting 
a job -- any job -- just to put a few dollars in his pocket. From there, he 
says, he will work his way to a position of management, perhaps return to the 
Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 He also considers initiating public seminars, charging people a dollar a 
question. He has a few inventions in mind that he keeps secret. 
</P>
<P>
 In implementing his plan, the first problem he faces is finding shoes. He has 
been attending the Chrysalis program, which helps people who are homeless find 
jobs. In addition to training, it provides clients with use of telephones, 
clothes to wear to interviews, bus tokens to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 He awakened early to shower and shave at the missions. By 9:30 a.m., he is 
digging through the rack of clothes at Chrysalis. He finds two black shoes that 
seem to match. They are the right size but both for the left foot. He settles 
on a pair of tan suedes and builds the rest of the wardrobe around them. The 
fourth jacket he tries fits good enough. It, too, is tan. He finds matching 
pants, a brown striped tie, blue shirt and a pair of brown socks. 
</P>
<P>
 He has chosen security as a field that can get him started and has made 
telephone contact with a business not far from Downtown. It will be his first 
interview since 1959, when he landed a job as office manager for Mutual of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bus, he rehearses his lines in preparation for the interview. He finds 
the building and pauses to straighten his tie and untangle his hair with his 
fingers in the reflection of a window. He looks professional, all together a 
different person. 
</P>
<P>
 The small waiting room is filled with younger, almost military-looking 
applicants. After finishing the paperwork, he is called in and talks to a man 
for about 15 minutes. There is laughter coming from the room. When he comes 
out, he is smiling, certain he has landed a job. His mind is racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to call them back with telephone numbers for my references, but I'm 
sure I got it," he says. The discussion did not progress to money, but McKelvey 
says he will push for $7 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 He promptly provides the business with the numbers, but they never call back. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees a classified ad and interviews the following week at a hotel and comes 
away with the same confidence and optimism but also the same result. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sinking in and it's something I just have to live with of what I blew, 
what I lost," he says after being turned down. "It's hard to live with, and I'm 
having real trouble seeing my way out of it. Very few people had it made like I 
had it made. Now I have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 He is no longer thinking about his grandiose plans, no longer slinging the 
anger that seems to swell by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the problem," he says, "is that I have big dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 He is thinking about his 8-year-old daughter. He wants her to know something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 But even in his down moments, something tells him to hang on, to fight his 
battles in the only way apparent to him -- to ride the wave. He says he has 
never been suicidal, and he is determined to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would die now," he says, "I go out a loser." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The street is lined with Benzes and Beemers, and off to the side, Terry 
McKelvey lies passed out on the sidewalk. He has been drinking since his 
general relief money came through the previous week. His chest is bare, grime 
stains his unshaven face. 
</P>
<P>
 When his check arrived, he opened a bank account, fearing cash would wind up 
with thieves. During the weekend, he was robbed of his weapons, papers and a 
few cans of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 He wakes up and stands on the sidewalk, heads for the bank, then to the liquor 
store, then back to the sidewalk with a six-pack of Blitz beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. County made the biggest mistake in the world," he says. "They approved 
my G.R." 
</P>
<P>
 He spent Sept. 6, his 59th birthday, in court for an open-container violation. 
He was sentenced to one day of community service. That was on Tuesday, and now 
it is Thursday. What happened, he wonders, to Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes are red, his voice is loud -- both happy and sad -- as he shouts to a 
man sporting a gray suit and a ponytail as the man climbs out of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you're on my side. You look like a winner," McKelvey says, suspecting 
the man is a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am," the man says as he loads his briefcase and a box of files onto a 
luggage caddy. He is friendly and smiles at McKelvey. "Good luck," he says as 
he walks away. 
</P>
<P>
 A siren from a firetruck screams and McKelvey becomes infuriated, yelling at 
it to shut up. He lifts the tab from a beer can but it breaks off in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never buy cheap beer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Something invisible and cruel shoves Thomas Jefferson to McKelvey's 
consciousness. "The founders of this country were fantastic," he says, suddenly 
serious, "a great bunch of guys, but I didn't know them." 
</P>
<P>
 The beer slows his racing mind to a crawl. It is the only way he knows to 
relax. He stabs the can with a pen, and foam surges out. He raises the beer, 
blows foam in all directions and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, the light has softened to orange, reflecting off the tops of 
skyscrapers, abandoning streets in encroaching darkness. The parked cars are 
gone, and the last of the Downtown professionals are emptying onto the 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 McKelvey sits torpidly and alone, talking to himself on the sidewalk. The 
stench from nearby trees and bushes thickens the air. His words are slurred and 
sodden. There is something almost childlike in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he says, "I made it. I really made it, didn't I? Fifty-nine years. 
I made it."

THE GOODS; HOW TO REPOSSESS YOUR CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the end of this year, it will have happened to about 180,000 of us in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving a restaurant or a friend's home, especially in an unfamiliar part of 
town, you discover that something large and hard to lose is missing. It's your 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 You haven't forgotten where you left it. Thieves have not stolen it. You've 
misread or ignored a traffic sign, or haven't registered your vehicle, and it's 
been towed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some drivers get angry and blame everyone but themselves. But there are more 
efficient approaches to reclaiming your transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Locating Your Wheels: In most cases, the first step is to call any of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's 16 divisions, which have computerized records of 
impounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tows are initiated by police or the city's Department of Transportation, 
and the vehicles end up in garages belonging to the 17 towing services that 
hold contracts with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A merchant or property owner who orders your vehicle removed may use a private 
towing firm. "But a tower who's not from an official police garage is required 
to notify the city within 30 minutes, so that when you call the LAPD they will 
tell you where the car is," says Detective Kelly P. Mulldorfer of the Police 
Commission's Investigation Division, which oversees official police garages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaiming the Vehicle: Once you've located the car, go to the towing garage 
with a valid driver's license, proof of ownership or registration, and enough 
cash or a major credit card to pay impound and storage fees. 
</P>
<P>
 What It Costs: You'll pay a $71.25 fine ($139.50 for trucks weighing more than 
10,000 pounds) to the towing company and a $40 release fee to the city, says 
Ken Spiker Jr., executive director of the Official Police Garage Assn. of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also surrender daily storage costs of $13.25 for standard vehicles; $15 
for one-ton trucks 20 feet or less; $19.75 for trucks, boats and house trailers 
longer than 20 feet, and $4.25 for motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket Scofflaws: To regain a car that's been impounded with five or more 
tickets, you must pay the tickets at a Department of Transportation Parking 
Violations Bureau and come back to the impound lot with a receipt. There are 
four locations -- Downtown, Mid-Wilshire, Van Nuys and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no process to collect fines for fewer tickets," Spiker says, 
"although such a system has been discussed with the police commission." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Delay: After three days of storage, the towing garage can start 
proceedings to sell your car at a police auction -- these are held weekly -- to 
recoup unpaid costs. The public auction may take place after 15 days, but is 
usually not conducted for about six weeks. Cheaper cars are often auctioned 
fastest so storage fees won't exceed the value of the car, says Mulldorfer of 
the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the garage must advertise the sale," he says. "It must also send letters 
to owners explaining the sale and informing them they can oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem with notification comes when new owners don't register 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Towers are only required to notify the registered owner about the sale, so 
the paperwork goes to the old owner and he throws it into the trash," 
Mulldorfer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits from the auction in excess of towing and storage fees are supposed to 
be sent to the Department of Motor Vehicles and be available for the owner of 
the car, Mulldorfer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most owners never notify the DMV. I don't think they know the money is 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 There were also complaints in the past that some lien sales "were not 
completely above board," Mulldorfer says. "But that was taken care of and it's 
very rare today with official police garages." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Attracts Tow Trucks: Your auto is eligible for impound and sale if you're 
arrested while driving, if you're pulled over and have no proof of a valid 
driver's license or if your registration expired more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The car can also be removed if it's in a tow-away zone, blocking a fire 
hydrant, in an intersection or otherwise obstructing traffic. It's also a 
candidate for towing if it's parked in one spot for 72 hours or if unpaid fines 
on the vehicle exceed $500. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Transportation, which shares towing responsibility with 
police, is on the prowl, using computerized vans to check every parked vehicle 
in randomly selected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last-Minute Rescue: If you see an official police tow truck lifting up your 
car, you can ask the driver to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come upon your vehicle being towed or in process of being lifted up, 
the official police garage will drop the vehicle and charge half the $71.25 
towing fee," says Spiker from the Official Police Garage Assn. "You must still 
pay the $40 fee mandated by the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Protect Your Valuables: If you're present and can't stop your car from being 
towed, it's smart to retrieve your valuables or, if you can't, point out 
valuables in the vehicle so they can be included on the report, Mulldorfer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the items turn up missing, you have verification they were in your car in 
the first place," she says. "A lot of times, the public is upset. They try to 
allege theft that just comes up to the cost of the impound." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Commission investigates these complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals: Supervisors in the Transportation Department generally conduct 
hearings for those who think their vehicles have been towed unjustly. You may 
bring witnesses and ask that the officer who ordered the tow be present. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the supervisor decides we did have probable cause to tow, and the car 
owner still is unsatisfied, he can file a complaint with the city clerk's 
office," says Jim Price, a parking enforcement manager at the Transportation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case the city clerk generally asks the city attorney to conduct an 
investigation to decide again whether there was probable cause, Price says.

 DON'T LOOK AT ME: Orange County Chamber of Commerce President Kenneth Moore 
has been to Vietnam to promote business ties to that country. And that's a 
problem for Kent Moore of Newport Beach, who has been lobbying for Vietnamese 
American students to get more English classes at local colleges. . . . Some of 
them, bitterly opposed to overtures to communist Vietnam, mistakenly believe 
from news reports that their mentor may be betraying them. Says Kent Moore: 
"I'm not involved with that. I just want to help the students here."

 SPACE PROUD: It's not often you have a grand opening just to brag about your 
warehouse. But then, Hitachi, the booming Japanese electronics manufacturer, 
has reason to be proud of its new warehouse and West Coast headquarters on 
South Street in Anaheim: 340,000 square feet of space, which has seen $55 
million worth of goods -- TVs, VCRs, stereos -- come through since it opened in 
August. . . . Hitachi officials will show it off to local dignitaries at 11 
a.m. today.

 SEE JANE SMILE: A new exhibit chronicling the Dick and Jane learn-to-read 
series opens Monday at the Fullerton Public Library (E1). A bonus for visitors 
is a display of collectible Dick and Jane dolls made by Barbara Barnum of 
Fullerton. Her company sells the dolls for $350 each. . . . The appeal? "The 
nostalgia," says Barnum, who learned to read in the '50s. "I would always 
anticipate going to the next story and wondering what Jane was going to be 
doing."

 G-RATED: For 34 years, Knott's Berry Farm proudly backed the privately owned 
Mott Miniature Museum & Dollhouse shop near its gates. But the arrangement 
ended two years ago, and Chris Mott, its third-generation owner, now has put 
most of the museum in storage. His latest proposal to Buena Park was: Help 
finance putting the museum into what is now the X-rated Studio Theater, near 
Knott's along Beach Boulevard. . . . But that plan fell through, and Mott, who 
still runs a local retail dollhouse shop, may move the museum out of state.

SENATE GOP FILIBUSTER ALL BUT KILLS LOBBY REFORM BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill to curb the influence of lobbyists was all but killed in the Senate on 
Thursday, the victim of one of a half dozen filibusters that Republicans have 
been using to delay or defeat Democratic initiatives in the waning hours of the 
103rd Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Senate passed the legislation by an overwhelming majority earlier 
in the session, sponsors fell eight votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a 
GOP filibuster blocking final passage. The measure would tighten financial 
disclosure requirements for lobbyists and bar them from giving gifts or 
providing free travel and entertainment to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of both the House and Senate are continuing to discuss possibly making 
one final effort to salvage the bill or at least part of it, by changing 
lobbying disclosure requirements that Republicans oppose. Sensitive to 
allegations that they are being almost blindly obstructionist, Republicans 
offered to support a ban on gifts if it were brought back as a separate bill 
without the other lobbying provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the mood on the eve of adjournment turned progressively more partisan 
and bitter, angry Democrats were showing no inclination to give the Republicans 
political cover for what has clearly been a strategy aimed at blocking almost 
every major measure, apparently in the belief that voter discontent with 
Congress will work to GOP advantage in the Nov. 8 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With Congress set to adjourn today, the chief House and Senate sponsors of the 
lobbying bill said that there would not be enough time, in any case, to 
negotiate any significant changes and that the legislation is effectively dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Republican-led filibuster has apparently killed the best chance in 40 years 
. . . to enact a tough lobbying reform and gift-ban law," said Sen. Carl Levin 
(D-Mich.), who sponsored the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have killed it," said Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.), Levin's 
counterpart in the House. "They have preserved their free meals and free 
tickets and free golf outings for another two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 52 to 46 on the cloture motion, as seven moderate Republicans 
sided with 45 Democrats, including California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne 
Feinstein, in voting to end the filibuster. They were opposed by 10 Democrats 
and 36 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbying bill, which would ban virtually all gifts from lobbyists and put 
an end to the much criticized junkets and charity sporting events in which many 
lawmakers participate, was one of three reform bills the Democrats hoped would 
bolster their standings in the polls this November by convincing voters that 
Congress is serious about restricting the influence of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two bills, measures to streamline the congressional bureaucracy and 
change the way political campaigns are financed, also died in the Senate, 
largely because of Republican opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats charged that Republicans were simply trying to keep anything on 
President Clinton's legislative agenda from passing Congress before the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, however, said that their objections have nothing to do with the 
gift ban but with another provision which they feared might impose unfair 
restrictions on grass-roots lobbying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by this interpretation of the disclosure requirements, major lobbying 
groups, including the conservative Christian Coalition and the American Civil 
Liberties Union, joined a campaign against the bill mounted last week by House 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and other GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Gingrich's complaints, the lobbyists argued that the disclosure 
requirements could oblige grass-roots groups that lobby Congress to reveal the 
names of their members and even require ordinary individuals who call to bend 
the ear of their representatives to register as lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, however, charged that those interpretations amounted to distortions and 
"deliberate disinformation" put out by Republicans to "scare people into 
opposing the bill." He said that the registration requirements would apply only 
to paid professional lobbyists and that the only names they would have to 
disclose would be those of the "person or persons who pay them to 
professionally lobby" Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that Gingrich and other GOP leaders were only trying to keep 
Democrats from claiming credit for their reform efforts. He noted that 
Republicans overwhelmingly supported the disclosure provisions when the Senate 
passed the lobbying reform bill on a 95-2 vote last year. The gift ban, which 
subsequently was folded into the lobbying legislation when it emerged from a 
conference with the House, cleared the Senate, 95 to 4, last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last-minute surge of opposition -- from conservative Christian 
organizations, radio talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and business groups 
like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- convinced even some Democrats to change 
their minds and support the GOP filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I've learned over the past few days is that lobbyists are 
very good at lobbying," said freshman Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), another 
supporter of the bill. "They mounted a full-court press to defeat this bill and 
they succeeded, at least for the moment."

 TIES THAT BIND: Forging bonds with foreign towns has led to beautiful 
relationships for some Ventura County cities. . . . Thousand Oaks is holding an 
Oct. 16 concert to benefit Spitak, its Armenian sister city. Residents in 
Oxnard and Ocotlan, Mexico, regularly visit back and forth. And Fillmore is 
flirting with the notion of sisterhood with Osaka, Japan, after an Osaka 
delegation toured town last month. . . . But Santa Paula's been out of touch 
with its sister -- Obregon, Mexico -- even though a park is named after the 
Mexican town. "Maybe they have a park named after us," City Manager Arnold 
Dowdy pondered. 
</P>
<P>
 BATTLE LINES: Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) may be in for the 
fight of his political career in November as he faces a strong anti-incumbent 
tide and well-financed GOP challenger Richard Sybert (A3). . . . The race has 
attracted national GOP luminaries eager to help Sybert oust the congressman 
from the district that includes Thousand Oaks. But Beilenson's campaign 
strategists say he's not your average incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 PASSING MUSTER: Anything less than a C average may not be good enough to earn 
a high school diploma in Oxnard (B1). . . . School officials are considering 
the policy to beef up standards. They've already increased the number of 
credits required to graduate from 220 to 230. . . . Oak Park High has the 
county's highest credit requirement for graduation -- students need at least 
240. "If you have high expectations, kids reach those expectations," Principal 
Jeff Chancer said.

<P>
 LIGHTNING STRIKES: Naturalist Gretel Ehrlich reads tonight at the Ventura 
Bookstore from her account of being struck by lightning. . . . In Ventura 
County, a computerized system that will help fire officials keep tabs on such 
occurrences goes on-line within six months. It will enable firefighters to sort 
emergency responses by category. "We'll be able to track more accurately the 
types of calls we get," county Fire Capt. Alex Sanchez said. Sister Cities

<P>
 Four cities in Ventura County have sister-city relationships with towns in 
other countries, while Fillmore has been talking to Japanese officials about 
establishing such a tie.

AERIAL MALATHION SPRAYING TO BEGIN IN CAMARILLO AREA; MEDFLIES: SIX-MONTH 
PROGRAM COVERING 16 SQUARE MILES WILL GET UNDER WAY WEDNESDAY. THE ORDER COMES 
A DAY AFTER AN 86-SQUARE-MILE QUARANTINE IS IMPOSED. 
</P>

<P>
 State and Ventura County officials announced Thursday that a six-month program 
of aerial spraying of malathion will begin Wednesday over 16 square miles in 
the eastern Camarillo area in an effort to wipe out the state's newest Medfly 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopters will begin night spraying of a sticky combination of the pesticide 
and corn syrup over homes and fields in an area populated by 29,000 people 
within a two-mile radius of a field where the Medfly infestation was discovered 
a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The order to spray from state Agriculture Secretary Henry J. Voss came one day 
after an 86-square-mile quarantine was imposed over a larger area of the county 
and discovery of more Medflies and larvae in an orchard at St. John's Seminary 
in Camarillo. The most recent find brings the total to 58 flies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest single infestation found in such a short period of time 
in the state," Voss said at a press conference in Camarillo. "Finding the 
larvae was a bad sign that there is another generation of Medflies out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said authorities decided more quickly to order spraying in Ventura County 
than they had for any other infestation in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Thursday's news conference, in fact, state agriculture officials had 
suggested that it would take longer to reach the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed of the decision angered some Camarillo residents, including Barbara 
O'Neill Ferris, who first learned of the malathion plan Thursday. "The public 
wasn't ever given a forum to voice their opinions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Camarillo area residents supported the decision, however. Somis citrus 
rancher John Borchard called the Medfly a cancer that has to be cut out 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 While the announcement of aerial spraying did not mention Gov. Pete Wilson as 
a participant in the decision, the governor's office made clear that he fully 
supported aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristine Berman, Wilson's deputy press secretary, said the governor will sign 
an emergency declaration today that will allow the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerial spraying will be conducted 10 to 12 times at two-week intervals 
over the next six months beginning at about 9 p.m. and lasting until midnight 
or 1 a.m. Three helicopters flying at about 300 to 700 feet will sprinkle the 
combination of 1.2 ounces of malathion to nine ounces of corn syrup for every 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
 The boundaries for spraying could be enlarged by another mile if Medflies are 
found within half a mile of the outside perimeter, Voss said. Aerial spraying 
is the quickest, most efficient and least costly method to combat an 
infestation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the best way to allay the fears of the county's and state's 
agriculture trading partners, Voss said. Ventura County, where agriculture is 
the No. 1 industry, produced about $850 million in crops last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is the state's No. 1 producer of lemons and oranges and No. 2 
producer of avocados and strawberries. State officials have feared that the 
Camarillo infestation could lead to embargoes by Japan and other countries on 
all California produce, not just Ventura County fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is our largest importer, but we are also concerned that Florida and 
Texas will quarantine us out of their states, and possibly Louisiana and 
Georgia as well," Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss estimated the cost of the spraying program at about $1 million, to be 
shared equally by the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Meyers, a U.S. agriculture official, said his staff has been in touch 
with Japanese government officials in Tokyo since the first Medflies were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very concerned," he said, adding that the Japanese are sending 
representatives to Camarillo next week to inspect the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Agriculture Commissioner Earl McPhail agreed that the spraying 
was needed to convince importers that Ventura County and California are acting 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have learned over the years that our trading partners do not make idle 
threats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said the infestation, if not stopped, could affect 11,000 to 12,000 jobs 
in agriculture and another 15,000 in related industries in the county. But 
McPhail said the scenario could be far worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this whole county were quarantined, you could triple those figures," 
McPhail said. He has estimated that up to $439 million in crops could be lost 
under the worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no information on any spraying decision was available to the public 
until Thursday, McPhail said he became convinced that aerial spraying was the 
best solution on Monday after additional flies were being found every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said he received a similar recommendation from U.S. Food and Agriculture 
officials and that by Monday he had made his recommendation to Wilson. He said 
he kept the plans secret until Thursday until all details of the spraying 
program were worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, officials have been avoiding aerial spraying, instead 
releasing 430 million sterile Medflies per week throughout the basin. The 
sterile males mate with fertile females and prevent the females from producing 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts have mentioned a sterile release program as an alternative to 
malathion in Ventura County, but the laboratories in Hawaii, Mexico and 
Guatemala that produce the Medflies have been working at capacity to supply Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Voss said he believed some sterile flies could be made available, he 
said it would take at least a year to eradicate the Medfly from the county 
using that option.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, growers supported the decision to spray, although they said they did 
not lobby the county or state for aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 But one resident, Alan Rosin, who lives at the retirement community of Leisure 
Village with his ailing, 84-year-old mother, broke into the meeting and shouted 
at Voss, McPhail and other officials on the dais at Camarillo City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Explain to me why 3,000 elderly people with skin and respiratory problems 
have to be included in the spraying area," he demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 But McPhail said Leisure Village residents should not be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sympathize," McPhail said. "But they have to understand that there is an 
economic base to this county, and without it, they won't have their same way of 
life."

U.S. JUDGE BACKS PART OF ABORTION LAW RULED ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor women in Pennsylvania must continue to provide a police report 
documenting rape or incest to get a taxpayer-funded abortion, a federal appeals 
judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Carol Los Mansmann of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily 
blocked a lower court decision overturning a portion of the state's restrictive 
abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision "means we can keep operating under the law as the Legislature 
enacted it," said Robert Gentzel, spokesman for state Atty. Gen. Ernie Preate 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, U.S. District Judge John P. Fullam had ruled that poor women 
seeking taxpayer-funded abortions do not have to produce a police report. 
Fullam also said the state could not require that two doctors certify an 
abortion is necessary to save a woman's life before Medicaid will pay for an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullam said those sections of the law are improper because they are more 
restrictive than the federal Hyde Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the hearing on the state's appeal of Fullam's 
decision.

PUBLIC QUICKLY TAKES SIDES ON SPRAY; MEDFLY: AS THE NEWS SPREADS THROUGH THE 
AERIAL DROP ZONE, A RICH MIX OF CITRUS GROVES AND RESIDENCES, FEAR AND 
RESIGNATION MINGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fruit growers pictured it as a surgical strike needed to prevent economic 
ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents envisioned it more as a rain of poison threatening their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 And some resigned souls saw it as a necessary nuisance -- a liquid shield for 
Ventura County's vulnerable $800-million-a-year fruit market they will just 
have to scrub off their cars twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
 As state and county officials announced their plan for aerial spraying to 
fight a Medfly infestation in Camarillo, the news spread quickly through the 
16-square-mile spray zone, a rich mix of citrus groves and subdivisions, of 
schoolyards and retirement communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics attacked the swift decision to spray. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials recommended it Monday -- just three days after two mated 
female Medflies were found in an orchard at St. John's Seminary. And they 
confirmed it publicly at a news conference Thursday, just six days before 
spraying expected is to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was an agribusiness decision and there was no input from the 
public," said Camarillo resident Barbara O'Neill Ferris, who first learned of 
the malathion plan at the press conference. "The public wasn't ever given a 
forum to voice their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks pregnant, Ferris said she worries the pesticide might affect her 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm told not to drink alcohol or coffee," she said. "And now they're going to 
spray me and they don't even give a hoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Belshe, director of the California Department of Health, said at the 
news conference there is no significant health risk from aerial malathion 
spraying. And county and state officials said they plan to expand on that at a 
public meeting Tuesday at Las Colinas School in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some in the neighborhoods in the Medfly spray zone said they doubt the 
reassurances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really trust what the government says about it being safe," said 
Kathie Henton of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 As word of the spraying plan filtered out Thursday, the public quickly took 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't do something about it, you'd destroy agriculture in Ventura 
County," argued Somis citrus rancher John Borchard. "It's just like a cancer. 
If you get it when it's first detected, it's a very small surgery and it 
doesn't affect the entire body." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade of spraying in Southern California has failed to kill the Medfly, 
argued Corey Deeter, a member of the Conejo Valley Organic Gardening Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take millions of dollars of the public's money to poison people," she 
said. "It's not safe, and it's futile, because the Medflies are still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Others around Camarillo said they fear the brief drizzle of malathion every 
two weeks or so will poison their children and pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're worried it's going to damage our cars and all that stuff, how 
about our children?" asked Rosie Ortiz. "They should find another way." 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Erika, said she wants to let the family cat, Tim, sleep inside 
while her neighborhood is being sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim usually sleeps outside, but the family will have to make an exception, 
said Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm going to have to," Ortiz added. "Knowing (Erika), she'll cry all 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Harding, principal of El Rancho Elementary School, said she is worried 
about her pupils getting malathion on their hands from playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get our lunch tables washed off before the kids ever get there in the 
morning," she vowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo resident Julie Knutson groaned with dismay after learning that the 
spray area includes Dos Caminos Elementary School, which her 8-year-old 
daughter, Linsey, attends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should avoid this area, especially since there are no fruit 
trees here," Knutson said, as she picked up her daughter after class Thursday. 
"Linsey's already stopped eating fruits and vegetables because of the Medflies, 
and now, with the spray, I don't know that I blame her.' 
</P>
<P>
 But parent Nancy McCort was unfazed. "I've used malathion before on my own 
fruit trees," she said, "It's no big deal; you just have to be sure to wash up 
afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, second-grade teacher Cheryl Parker wondered if she should remove 
the wooden pots of peas, cauliflowers and carrots her pupils planted in the 
school courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the spraying, these might be better off inside," she said. "This will be 
a good way to teach the kids about the malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pleasant Valley School District, associate superintendent Howard 
Hamilton said he plans to have all their outdoor tables and playground 
equipment hosed down after each spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty comfortable that it's safe for the children, but we still want 
to take every precaution we can," Hamilton said. "But this is all happening 
really fast. I mean, they're talking about starting up next Wednesday, so that 
doesn't give us a lot of time to prepare." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Leisure Village, the giant retirement community that sits at the eastern 
edge of the spray zone, 97-year-old Mauray Malnick pooh-poohed health concerns 
over the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I worried about all the sprays and poisons and everything else that's 
supposed to be bad for me, I'd be dead by now," Malnick said. "If they need to 
spray to get rid of the pests, that's just fine by me." 
</P>
<P>
 But John Callas, another resident of the Leisure Village senior citizens 
community, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know from the spraying in other places that this stuff can ruin the paint 
job on your car," Callas said. "What a bother to have to go out there every 
time they spray and cover up your car. There's got to be a better way to handle 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that each spraying will deposit only 1.2 ounces of malathion per acre 
cut no ice with another resident of Leisure Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue of life and death to the elderly people of Leisure Village," 
said Alan Rosin, who lives there with his 84-year-old mother, Betty Rosin. "We 
can't even evacuate because it's going to be sprayed l2 separate times." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said it was her understanding that the boundaries 
could change and that county officials would try to determine whether spraying 
needed to take place over the gated community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leisure Village is definitely a concern," Kildee told Rosin. "If it needs to 
be sprayed to take care of the Medfly then it will have to be sprayed. But if 
it doesn't, it will not." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosin shot back: "When will I know so that I have time to get my mother out of 
Leisure Village? What I see happening is a large rush to very quick decisions."

 * MAIN STORY: A1 Medfly Quarantine and Eradication Areas Aerial spraying of 
malathion begins Wednesday over the 16-square mile eradication zone. State 
officials have ordered 10 to 12 aerial drops over the next six months. Ground 
spraying of the pesticide continues within 660 feet of each Medfly discovered. 
Source: State Department of Food and Agriculture What to Do Aerial spraying of 
malathion is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal agencies report that malathion has been studied extensively, 
and there is no evidence that it causes cancer, birth defects, nerve damage, 
eye damage or cumulative injury. But residents are cautioned to avoid exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also recommend that the following precautions be taken during and 
after spraying: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remain indoors if possible while spraying is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * If outdoors, avoid looking up at the falling droplets. 
</P>
<P>
 * If in contact with spray, wash residues from skin and clothing with soap and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave laundry outdoors when spraying is scheduled. If laundry is 
soiled, rewash before wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put your car in a garage or carport or cover it with a plastic tarp to 
prevent paint damage when spraying is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your car is outside during spraying, wash it the next day to prevent 
paint damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse plastic skylights and awnings the day after spraying to prevent 
permanent stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover fish ponds before spraying and uncover shortly after to minimize water 
contamination while avoiding oxygen depletion. 
</P>
<P>
 * After an area has been sprayed, wash outdoor eating areas, playground 
equipment and objects such as toys and pet food dishes that may have been 
outside during spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid harvesting home-grown fruits and vegetables for three days after 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse all fresh fruits and vegetables with water before cooking or eating 
them, just as you should with store-bought items.

 Candidates for the Oxnard City Council expressed divergent and sometimes 
unpopular views on issues confronting the city during a forum Thursday, 
touching on the topics of redevelopment, affordable housing and the city's 
chronic budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum at the Oxnard Hilton drew an audience of about 70 people, who 
listened as moderators asked the panel of 10 council candidates and two mayoral 
candidates a series of prepared questions. Eleven candidates are vying for 
three City Council seats in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, most of the participants said they would work to create jobs, 
increase public safety, and balance the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need jobs, jobs, jobs," said council candidate John C. Zaragoza. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the candidates, however, offered details on ways to tackle those 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates' positions on longstanding Oxnard issues elicited groans and 
hissing from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Karrin, a retired caterer, said Oxnard's efforts to redevelop its 
downtown are "a waste of time," because older small businesses cannot compete 
with the city's larger, more recent stores along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city made downtown into a desert by bringing in Wal-Mart and all the big 
chains," said Karrin, 78. 
</P>
<P>
 William Winter, 38, a columnist for a San Diego-based Filipino newsletter, 
said Oxnard should not bother to create affordable housing for its low-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in the affordable-housing concept," Winter said. "I believe 
in having people work, pay their bills and earn their money." 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Alvarez, a 34-year-old USC student, said Oxnard is wasting its money 
supporting efforts to save Ventura County's military bases because she believes 
they will be closed by federal officials in Washington anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Schwartz, 70, said he wants to implement his plan to start a farming 
commune in Oxnard, modeled after the Amish, to contain the city's homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeless people that are drunk, whatever, I have a plan to eliminate them," 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Tom Holden, 39, reiterated his main theme of cutting Oxnard's 
bureaucracy instead of public services. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to do is maintain quality services," Holden said. "The only way 
a business does this in tough times is to do things more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred A. Judy, 54, had previously been critical of the Oxnard City Council and 
politicians in general. But he said at Thursday's forum that he has been 
studying the council's positions and thinks the city is on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council candidates at the forum included Deborah De Moss, Dean Maulhardt 
and Roy Lockwood. Manuel Lopez, running for his second straight mayoral term, 
and Charles Olsen, a write-in candidate for mayor, also attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Paul Stein, who supports the construction of high-rise public housing 
along the Ventura Freeway, was the only one of the 11 Oxnard City Council 
candidates not to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the early morning question-and-answer session, the candidates ate 
breakfast and networked with city business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum was sponsored by the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and was moderated by 
the Government Relations Committee and the League of Women Voters of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Co., a developer that wants to build 5,000 homes at Ormond Beach, 
helped pay for the event.

ADVISERS SAY WILSON LACKS SPRAY OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some of his closest advisers and the California agriculture community, 
Gov. Pete Wilson has no choice but to swiftly order aerial spraying of a 
potentially devastating Medfly infestation in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In their view, failure to quickly spray would invite an economically crippling 
embargo of fruits and vegetables not only from the Mediterranean fruit 
fly-infested region of Ventura County but from throughout California as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a notion, aides said Thursday, is unthinkable for the Republican 
governor, who is campaigning hard for reelection on a platform of rebuilding 
the state's recession-weary economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, they vividly recalled the political damage Democratic Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. dealt himself in 1981 when he rejected recommendations of his 
scientific advisers and delayed aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion in 
an infested area of urban Santa Clara County. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay enabled the crop-destroying insect to gain a firmer foothold and 
provoked embargoes of California produce. It also cost taxpayers nearly $100 
million and severely undercut Brown's campaign against Wilson for the U.S. 
Senate in 1982. Wilson used the issue against Brown and won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Wilson is going to do the right thing, whether it is 30 days before or 
after the election," Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said. "Jerry Brown 
tried to play politics with the issue and he got burned for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Wilson will sign an emergency declaration today 
that will order helicopters loaded with malathion spray to begin their attacks 
in the Camarillo area next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the action was recommended by Ventura County officials and 
state Food and Agriculture Secretary Henry Voss. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, economists estimate that agriculture is a $19.9-billion-a-year 
industry and accounts for one in every 10 jobs. In Ventura County, the annual 
cash crop is valued at $848 million, nearly half of which is susceptible to 
Medfly infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 State agricultural officials pounced on Ventura County's Medfly infestation 
because traditionally the county has been the state's No. 1 producer of lemons 
and oranges and No. 2 producer of avocados and strawberries -- all hosts to the 
destructive pest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, a press secretary to Wilson, said public health and environmental 
protection officials in the Administration concurred in the decision to begin 
aerial spraying. He indicated that protection of the economy was the driving 
force behind the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This state will do everything to ensure that the economy is protected as well 
as the health of our citizens," he said. "But this is a severe infestation and 
needs to be dealt with quickly before we face an embargo both nationally and 
internationally." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Brown sided with environmentalists who opposed spraying, but he 
finally retreated in the face of embargoes of California produce and a threat 
by the federal government to quarantine the entire state. Also, a rebellious 
Democratic-controlled Legislature threatened to enact emergency spraying 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Republican Gov. George Deukmejian also faced a Medfly crisis and 
ordered malathion spraying in heavily populated parts of Los Angeles County, 
provoking fears of adverse health affects and an uproar over damage to car 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Wilson also ordered aerial attacks against the Medfly in 
the Norco area of Riverside. Aerial spraying concluded a few months ago, but it 
was not without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County discovery of a Medfly infestation last week touched off an 
especially loud alarm in the agriculture community because it was the first 
time the bug had been found in a commercial orchard, said Richard Matoian, 
president of the Grape and Tree Fruit League. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous discoveries in other parts of the state, Matoian said, were made in 
back-yard gardens and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is significant and it is scary," said Matoian, whose organization 
represents 85% of the volume of fruits and vegetables shipped out of the state. 
"We want to act quickly to prevent a trading embargo from our partners. For 
instance, they don't distinguish oranges from Ventura County from oranges from 
the San Joaquin Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Matoian said the Japanese are particularly wary of the Medfly. He and Clark 
Biggs of the California Farm Bureau Federation said if a statewide embargo were 
to be imposed, Japan would very likely act first and be followed by the 
Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing figures from a recent University of California study, Biggs said Far 
Eastern markets in 1992 received about 62% of California's fruit and vegetable 
commodities that can play host to the Medfly. These exports totaled $375 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said the study by economist Jerry Siebert estimated that a widening ripple 
effect of an embargo by Asian trading partners would have cost the California 
economy up to $1.4 billion in 1992, including 14,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs said growers considered the Ventura County infestation far more serious 
than the Riverside County Medfly troubles. "It is an absolute potential 
disaster for California agriculture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grape and Fruit Tree League, a substantial force in California 
agriculture, abandoned its traditional low-profile role earlier in the week 
when it publicly called on Wilson to embrace immediate aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration source, who asked not to be identified, said the league's 
action came as a surprise. "I think (the league) was really concerned that 
Wilson might be getting a little hinky about going to the air," said the 
source. "He's in a close election and maybe they thought he didn't want to 
upset people." 
</P>
<P>
 Matoian said the organization's unusual public appeal to Wilson was meant to 
"let him know exactly where we were on this issue. We didn't want there to be 
any mistake about that."

HEALTH CHIEF SAYS RESIDENTS NOT AT RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing studies by state health officials, Ventura County's top medical officer 
said Thursday that residents will face no major health threat from malathion 
spraying, but should take common-sense precautions to avoid exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no evidence to suggest an increased risk" of health problems, said 
Dr. Gary Feldman, Ventura County's public health officer.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think based on what we know, the decision (to spray) is a responsible one," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to sign an emergency declaration today that will 
order malathion spraying to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Riverside County -- where the pesticide was spewed over urban areas in 
February -- public health officials remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 After helicopters blanketed the cities of Corona and Norco with a mist of 
malathion and molasses-like bait, more than 240 people complained of problems 
including skin rashes, asthma attacks, hives and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, health officials concluded that seven to nine people -- out of 
60,000 to 70,000 exposed -- had recurring respiratory or skin problems so 
specific that a malathion reaction was the most likely cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to decide whether you think that's a lot or a little. My point was 
that there was a health effect to a few people," said Dr. Bradley Gilbert, 
public health officer for Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Mediterranean fruit fly appeared in California, health concerns 
have dominated the emotional debate surrounding the use of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 A 500-page report released by the state Department of Health Services in 1991 
concluded that malathion spraying poses no serious threat to the majority of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But echoing Gilbert's concerns, the study acknowledged for the first time that 
certain groups of people are more vulnerable to skin rashes, allergic responses 
and other ailments. Children, the elderly and people suffering respiratory 
problems are the most at risk from short-term effects, the study reported. And 
the state recommended further study of long-term exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, at a press conference in Camarillo where aerial spraying plans were 
announced, state health officials advised residents in the spray zone to wash 
off their children's playground equipment and to rinse their skin if contact 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to reassure residents, Kimberly Belshe, director of the state 
Department of Health Services, said her agency would not endorse malathion if 
it were not safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malathion is among the most studied pesticides in use," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To anti-spraying activists, those studies and statements mean little. In Los 
Angeles and Riverside counties, groups formed to oppose malathion spraying 
remain convinced that health effects are much more widespread that what has 
been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the citizens' rights are being abused," Los Angeles resident Lisabeth 
Hush said. During the 1989 and 1990 sprayings of the Los Angeles Basin, Hush 
said she entered the hospital twice with rapid heartbeats, and suffered what 
she said were other symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, residents began reacting to the news Thursday as health 
care facilities began planning for the expected nighttime flyovers. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital, which falls inside the spray zone, will 
shut down the air ventilation system and recirculate air inside the complex 
during spraying. Patients will be kept inside.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; ROAD BLOCKED BY SLIDE TO BE CLEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days after saying he lacked the funds to clear a landslide that has 
blocked South Mountain Road near Santa Paula since Sept. 8, the head of the 
Ventura County road department Thursday said work should begin at the site next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Britt, head of the county's transportation department, said the county 
awarded a $131,905 contract Thursday to Banner Construction of Goleta to clear 
the rural route. Scores of residents east of the slide now take a 30-minute 
detour through Fillmore to reach Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a larger slide at the same site took 11 weeks to clear. But Britt 
estimated that the current cleanup could be done in four to six weeks. Work 
could begin as soon as Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors, particularly Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose 
district includes residents inconvenienced by the slide, "has made it very 
clear to us to make it a priority to get it done," Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the work, he said, he intends to use money earmarked for the 
replacement of the Hueneme Road bridge, which leads the county's list of 
deficient bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul," Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he expects the $2-million bridge project, which was not to begin 
until late next year, to be deferred no more than a couple of months. Once 
other funding becomes available, perhaps through federal or state assistance, 
he could return the funds he took from the bridge project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Federal Highway Administration rejected the county's request for 
funding Monday, Britt expressed optimism after a meeting with the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency Wednesday that the latter might help pay for the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility results from the fact that the slide, according to county 
geologist Jim Fisher, was apparently triggered by an aftershock of the Jan. 17 
earthquake. GREG RIPPEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CANADA FIRM TO PAY $60,000 TO SETTLE SUIT 
</P>

<P>
 A Canadian company accused of trying to trick Ventura County residents into 
paying for merchandise they never really ordered agreed Thursday to pay $54,000 
in penalties to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment settled a lawsuit filed Thursday by the district attorney's office 
in Superior Court.The district attorney's office alleged that the company, 
Premium Appliance Warehouse, practiced false and misleading advertising and 
unfair business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The company mailed official-looking "shipping authorization forms" to 
customers, who were asked to send checks to a Connecticut post office box so 
they could "claim" merchandise, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Schwartz said. 
Company headquarters are in a Toronto suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said many people called the post office or the district attorney's 
office to complain, but others simply sent in the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people are on what you might call sucker lists," he said. "They 
think this must be the TV that they won or the vitamins that they ordered." 
</P>
<P>
 If customers sent about $17 to the appliance warehouse, they received a small 
package of trinkets such as a sewing kit, a miniature flashlight and costume 
jewelry, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Premium Appliance Warehouse and its parent company, Guildwood Direct Limited, 
did not admit any wrongdoing, and their attorney declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the firm agreed to pay $6,000 to a statewide fund for the prosecution of 
consumer fraud cases in addition to the $54,000 in penalties they paid the 
county. They also agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting them from 
unlawful conduct in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company has refunded money to some consumers who complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailings were sent all over the U.S. and Canada, Schwartz said. Ventura 
County took the lead and joined with the state attorney general's office to 
settle the case statewide, he said. IRA E. STOLL

<P>
 A Camarillo man suffered serious stab wounds and a 24-year-old man was 
arrested after a pre-dawn attack Thursday in Camarillo, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo Herrera, 22, was found sprawled on a sidewalk in a residential 
neighborhood on Raemere Street about 3:50 a.m., the victim of multiple stab 
wounds, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital, where Administrator Jim 
Gintz said he was in serious condition in the intensive-care unit. He said 
Herrera suffered wounds to the head, neck, chest and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo S. Meza, who was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, was 
being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, Sgt. Bruce Macedo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said they recovered what they believed to be the knife used in the 
attack. They said they found the weapon in Herrera's van, which was parked 
close to where he was found. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: EX-NURSE ORDERED TO TRIAL ON SEX CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former nurse at St. John's Regional Medical Center was ordered Thursday to 
stand trial on charges that he molested two male patients, but a third sexual 
battery count was dismissed after the alleged victim was unable to identify the 
defendant as the man who fondled him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Butikofer, 37, is scheduled for Superior Court arraignment Nov. 4 on 
two counts of sexual battery on an institutionalized victim.He is free on 
$10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men, all using a Spanish interpreter, testified at a preliminary hearing 
Thursday that they were fondled while being treated in the Oxnard hospital's 
emergency room. Two witnesses identified Butikofer as the man who molested 
them, but a third said he was unable to open his eyes because of blood flowing 
from a head wound and he could not see who fondled him. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the men -- injured in an automobile accident in May -- testified that 
they tried to stop the assault. The third said he was too ill from a stomach 
ailment to move while Butikofer fondled him in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Edward F. Brodie ruled that there was sufficient evidence to 
show that all three assaults occurred, but Butikofer could be linked only to 
two of them. BARBARA MURPHY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SEX EDUCATION TEXTS AVAILABLE FOR 
REVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District is making copies of the new sex 
education texts available to the public before the course materials are 
reviewed by the school board on Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board adopted the district's family life and birth control 
curriculum in February in the middle of a community debate over whether schools 
should only teach abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of teachers and nurses worked during the summer to develop the 
course materials, which would be used by seventh- and 10th-grade teachers for 
their sex education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a commitment that we would be very open every step of the way with 
this new curriculum," said Assistant Supt. Susan C. Parks. "We are previewing 
it in the office and allowing people to check it out for a short period of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten copies of the each of the texts, "Human Sexuality: Values and Choices" and 
"Teen Sexual Behavior: A Leader's Resource of Practical Strategies with Youth," 
will be available at the district office, 875 E. Cochran St. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COLLEGE WILL HOST WEEKEND SWAP MEET 
</P>

<P>
 Moorpark College officials have reached an agreement with an Arizona promoter 
who plans to start a weekly swap meet at the east Ventura County campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Whittington of Markets West in Glendale, Ariz., said Thursday he plans to 
open the swap meet the weekend of Oct. 22-23 in the college parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be like an old-fashioned swap meet or flea market, with antiques, 
collectibles, food and drinks," Whittington said. "And we've set aside space 
for nonprofits and groups from the college to set up sales." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest plan to establish a year-round swap meet at Moorpark College 
follows a flea market that closed down last year after only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College Foundation Director Jim Niles said holding the sale both 
Saturday and Sunday would stimulate interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You generate people not only with the advertising, but a huge part of it is 
the casual drive-by traffic," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Whittington said he already has arranged for newspaper and cable television 
advertisements to promote the swap meet.  
</P>
<P>
 He expects 40 to 50 vendors to be selling goods during the initial weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement between Markets West and Moorpark College, the campus will 
receive 20% of the gross receipts, Whittington said.  
</P>
<P>
 Niles estimates that would amount to $25,000 or more in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet will be open 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, the 
promoter said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 2 WOMEN HIT BY CAR, HOSPITALIZED

<P>
 Two Westlake Village women on a morning walk were struck by a car and injured, 
one of them seriously, in Thousand Oaks Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, Jane A. Taschereau, 51, and Arlene H. Levitt, 57, were hit by car 
at about 7:50 a.m. at Westlake Boulevard and Triunfo Canyon Road, said 
Sheriff's Deputy Cindy Vickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers said the women, neighbors who routinely took morning strolls together, 
were walking east in the crosswalk when the car turned left on a green light 
from eastbound Triunfo Canyon to northbound Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, Walter Johnson of Westlake Village, failed to yield the 
right of way to the women while they were in the crosswalk, Vickers said, 
adding that Johnson estimated he was traveling about 15 m.p.h. when his car 
struck the women. The investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Taschereau, who suffered a broken pelvis and left shoulder, was listed in 
serious condition at Westlake Medical Center, said spokeswoman Kris Carraway. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Levitt, who suffered a head laceration, was listed in fair condition. 
Both were in the intensive care unit. GREG RIPPEE

RAIN DAMAGES VOLUMES AT LEAKY LIBRARY; THOUSAND OAKS: STORM ARRIVED JUST BEFORE 
ROOF, WHICH HAS HAD PROBLEMS EVER SINCE THE BUILDING OPENED IN 1982, WAS TO BE 
REPAIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The rainstorm that drenched parts of Ventura County earlier this week soaked 
bookshelves at the leaky-roofed Thousand Oaks Library, causing several thousand 
dollars worth of damage, library officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day storm arrived just weeks before repairs were to be completed on 
the library's roof, which has leaked every rainy season since the building 
opened in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Because construction is still under way, portions of the roof were covered 
only by tarps when the first storm of the season struck, allowing water to pour 
into the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was raining inside the library," said Steve Brogden, deputy director of 
the library. "We had huge garbage cans out; we had plastic, (and) we had water 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Library personnel and construction workers draped sheets of plastic over 
bookcases to protect them from the rainwater, but their efforts were not enough 
to keep the cascading water from damaging some of the library's 325,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we have lost some materials," Brogden said. "It has mostly been to 
the books." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Grant Brimhall said preliminary damage estimates were about 
$5,000 to $10,000. He said three or four roofing crews would be working this 
weekend to seal the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "God sends rain on the just and the unjust, and we are trying to decide which 
we are," Brimhall said. "We want our people to quit praying for rain, at least 
until we get this done." 
</P>
<P>
 The library closed briefly Sept. 29 during some small showers, but shut down 
entirely Tuesday and is expected to remain closed until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, librarians will begin sorting through the books to determine how many 
were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the areas where the water was coming in the hardest and those will be 
the areas we will hit first," Brogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the children's book section suffered considerable damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager Greg Pruett of Keller Construction Co. said heavy rains from 
the two-day storm caught workers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did get a couple of rains a week ago and we controlled those measures," 
Pruett said. "But when we got the volumes of water in a short amount of time, 
that is where we got the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The storm dropped more than two-thirds of an inch of rain on Thousand Oaks 
during a 48-hour period, and dumped almost three inches of rain in some 
mountainous areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruett said Keller Construction would pay for the water damage. "We have 
insurance for this sort of thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, workers will continue the roofing project and hope to have it 
completed before the end of the month. "The project will be completed in about 
15 to 20 days," Pruett said. "We are taking temporary precautions as best we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 The roof leaks because of a poor architectural design, city officials say. And 
in July, the building's architect, construction manager and subcontractors 
agreed to pay $1.28 million to the city to help cover the costs of repairing 
the leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are now adding larger drainage pipes and altering the slope of the 
roof so that water will no longer collect in pools around the skylights. 
</P>
<P>
 For patrons, this week's rain damage is only the latest in a string of 
disasters and mishaps that have dogged the Thousand Oaks Library, the biggest 
city library in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The library suffered about $2-million worth of damage during the Northridge 
earthquake, and quake-related repairs are not expected to be completed until 
late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is almost like we just saw the light at the end of the tunnel and now that 
is blacked out," said Kathy Lewis, president of Friends of the Thousand Oaks 
Library. "It is really discouraging."

LITTLE FANFARE TO MARK THOUSAND OAKS' 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Daryl Reynolds knows all about tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But as president of the local historical society, she can't help wishing that 
Thousand Oaks officials would loosen up the purse strings just a bit today to 
mark the city's 30th birthday with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be fiscally responsible, of course, but sometimes it's fun to go 
way overboard," she said wistfully. "We need to think about our roots. . . . 
It's so important not to forget where we came from." 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens committee will take care of the historical reflections Sunday with 
dedication of a time capsule that looks at Thousand Oaks' past and imagines its 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloons and birthday cake, however, will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks marks its 30th year of cityhood today with little fanfare. 
Today's only event is an awards ceremony for the annual art and photography 
contest, entitled "Moments to Remember -- Celebrating Thousand Oaks' 30th 
Anniversary." The public reception will be at 5:30 p.m. at the Community 
Gallery in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But city leaders decided to defer the big party until the Civic Arts Plaza 
grand opening later this month. Theater-goers decked out in tuxedos and evening 
gowns will toast the anniversary with champagne Oct. 21 and 22, after gala 
performances by Broadway star Bernadette Peters and the Conejo Symphony 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the hoopla will undoubtedly focus on the new auditorium, civic 
leaders hope that the anniversary will receive a fair share of attention as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anniversary portion will come out after the glitter of the Civic Arts 
Plaza," Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce President Steve Rubenstein predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand opening will cause us to reflect on our past and pat ourselves on 
the back for a job well done," Rubenstein added. "I really mean it -- we did a 
great job building this community. And the Civic Arts Plaza is the piece de 
resistance ." 
</P>
<P>
 One resident's effort to divorce the anniversary from the grand opening 
fizzled early this fall when a photography contest designed to showcase 
Thousand Oaks' natural beauty folded for lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields organized a similar contest five years 
ago to honor the city's 25th birthday. But this time around, he failed to drum 
up support. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the contest, Frields plans to do his part to celebrate. He has 
volunteered to serve as the grand opening's official photographer. And he plans 
to capture the spirit of both the theater's maiden night and the city's 30th 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those photos could end up in the time capsule to be unveiled Sunday at 
1:15 p.m. in the Civic Arts Plaza's courtyard. Under a 200-pound copper oak 
tree sculpture affixed to a theater wall, Mayor Alex Fiore will dedicate the 
capsule. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "The Roots of Our Lives," the capsule will include a jumble of 
memorabilia, from an Elvis Presley stamp to a biology textbook to a tape of 
Fiore's inauguration in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren and scientists will add their predictions for the future. A 
graduate student has contributed a sketch of a sleek red automobile designed to 
float on magnetic fields at a speed of 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the objects to be buried are now on display in the Thousand Oaks 
Library, and organizers will continue to collect items for several months 
before cramming them into the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the time capsule is well-tended, Fiore will swear in 50 
children as official guardians. The 10-year-olds will return in two decades to 
add another capsule to the site and to swear in a new group of young guardians. 
The baton-passing will continue until the city's centennial in the year 2064.

YARD WASTE RECYCLER, RESIDENTS END DISPUTE OVER ODOR COMPLAINTS; SETTLEMENT: 
NEIGHBORS AGREE TO DROP PLANS FOR A LAWSUIT IN EXCHANGE FOR FIRM'S DECISION TO 
STOP ACCEPTING DEBRIS AT ITS FACILITY BETWEEN SIMI VALLEY AND MOORPARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The owners of an eastern Ventura County company that uses worms to recycle 
yard waste into fertilizer and the company's neighbors -- who had threatened to 
sue over the noxious odor they say is coming from the recycling operation -- 
announced Thursday in a joint news conference that they have settled their 
dispute.  
</P>
<P>
 The company, The Worm Concern, agreed to stop accepting debris as of next week 
at its 20-acre facility off Tierra Rejada Road between Simi Valley and 
Moorpark. The Worm Concern will eventually move to a new site several miles 
north of Moorpark near a mining operation off California 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's neighbors, who had hired an attorney and a political consultant 
in their attempt to move The Worm Concern out of the Tierra Rejada Valley, 
agreed to drop their plans for a lawsuit in exchange for the company's 
immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement announced here today shows that the new management of The Worm 
Concern does care about people," said Jim Hagman, owner of neighboring 
Elvenstar Ranch, which spearheaded the attack against The Worm Concern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton Holt, a member of The Worm Concern's board of directors, said the 
company had not changed management, but had changed its company policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to expand and grow," Holt said. "We recognized that the Tierra Rejada 
site would not allow for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 100 tons per day of "green waste" that The Worm Concern accepts 
comes from a curbside recycling program in Simi Valley. When similar programs 
in Thousand Oaks and Moorpark begin soon, the company expects to more than 
double the amount of material it accepts annually. 
</P>
<P>
 If The Worm Concern had decided to stop accepting material altogether, it 
would have jeopardized the recycling efforts of those east county cities that 
must meet a state-imposed limit on the amount of trash they send to area 
landfills.  
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that cities reduce by 25% the amount of trash they send to 
landfills by 1995, and 50% by 2000. Because green waste, or trash from lawn and 
garden clippings, makes up as much as 30% of the trash sent to landfills, 
recycling that waste would go a long way toward helping cities meet the state 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt and Hagman both thanked Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery for 
bringing the two sides together. At the press conference, Montgomery laid out 
the terms of the agreement worked out over the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, The Worm Concern will divert all new green waste from the 
Tierra Rejada site to a temporary site off West Los Angeles Avenue in Simi 
Valley. A permanent site will very likely open within 90 days, Montgomery said, 
and the material would then be moved there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three weeks ago I realized that the current process was not going to work," 
Montgomery said. "No matter what, we would have ended up in litigation. . . . 
Now I think we've worked out a win-win solution, but we still need the 
cooperation of the county to make this work." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Planning Department is considering requiring The Worm 
Concern to do a complete environmental review of both its operation off Tierra 
Rejada Road as well as a review of the new site before it can receive an 
operating permit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he hoped the interim agreement he helped negotiate would 
alleviate the requirement for an expensive environmental review. He said the 
new site, owned by Simi Valley contractor Dean Rasmussen, should not require 
the same detailed review because it would not have an impact on people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County planning director will rule within 30 days if the company 
must complete a full environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Wells, an administrative assistant for Supervisor Vicky Howard, said he 
was happy that an agreement was worked out but was curious that it occurred so 
close to the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Supervisor Howard is pleased that The Worm Concern is finally 
recognizing the concerns of the residents out there," Wells said. "I must say 
though that Vicky tried two years ago to get the company to move its operation, 
and I find it ironic that less than a month away from the November election 
they've decided to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasmussen's company, C.A. Rasmussen, donated $1,000 to Montgomery's campaign 
for the Ventura County supervisor's seat in the 4th District, covering Simi 
Valley, and The Worm Concern donated $250. Supervisor Howard is supporting Judy 
Mikels, Montgomery's opponent in the November election.

TRAIN HITS, KILLS WOMAN ON TRESTLE OVER RIVER; VENTURA: THE VICTIM WAS 
ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE HER DOG AS A SOUTHERN PACIFIC FREIGHT APPROACHED. 
</P>

 A Ventura woman strolling on the railroad trestle over the Ventura River was 
struck and killed by a locomotive when she tried to save her dog from the 
approaching train early Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Alamillo, 48, was struck on the head by the V-shaped cow guard of the 
southbound Southern Pacific freight train as it approached the Ventura County 
Fairgrounds shortly after 7 a.m., Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was pronounced dead at the scene, her body thrown by the train against the 
rusted railing of the 200-yard bridge that spans the river and its wetlands, 
just west of a bicycle path. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend walking with her, Herbert Summers of Ventura, and the dog were not 
injured by the 1 1/4-mile-long freight train that passed within inches of them 
at about 35 m.p.h., Ventura Police Sgt. Douglas Auldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's son, George Galvan, 18, was getting ready for school at their 
nearby duplex on Wall Street when a friend, who had seen the accident from the 
bicycle path, hurried to give Galvan the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragic, is what it is," Auldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled Galvan's words when he learned that his mother had tried to save 
their Staffordshire bull terrier. "She would do that. She loved that dog," 
Galvan told the police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers, 28, told investigators he and Alamillo were walking west on the 
bridge, away from Ventura, when the two-engine train approached them head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pair pressed against the guard rail, with about 18 inches of clearance 
between it and the train, the unleashed dog suddenly became spooked and lurched 
into the path of the engine, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Alamillo, who apparently had been holding the 45- to 60-pound dog by 
the scruff of the neck, reached out for him and was struck by the cow-catcher 
of the locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son identified her at the scene, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Furtney, a spokesman for Southern Pacific in San Francisco, said the rail 
line tries to dissuade pedestrians from trespassing on their bridges, such as 
the Ventura River bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, a 12-year-old boy was struck by a train on the same bridge but 
escaped with minor injuries. Nationwide, Furtney said, 523 pedestrians and 626 
motorists were killed in 1993 while crossing paths with trains. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the 2,406-ton train was en route Thursday to Long Beach from Oakland 
with an empty string of flat cars. The speed limit for trains crossing the 
bridge is 30 m.p.h., he said, and the locomotives can weigh as much as 400 
tons.

A LOOK AT LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These two comments (Oct. 1) by two different attorneys in two different cases 
are the sort of thing that contribute to the low regard held by many people 
toward lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 1.The defense attorney claimed that his client, given four life sentences for 
firing a gun into a crowd at the Westminster Mall, should have been charged 
with a lesser crime because the intent to kill was never proven. (What was the 
intent of firing a deadly weapon into a crowd -- fun and gaiety?) 
</P>
<P>
 2. The attorney for the woman charged with torturing a 10-year-old boy says 
all charges should be dismissed as the California statute on torture is vague 
and unconstitutional. (If what was reported in the news that has been done to 
the child had been inflicted on this attorney, would he have called it torture 
then?)

BURLINGTON TO KEEP LOW BID FOR SANTA FE; RAIL: COMPANY FEELS UNION PACIFIC'S 
$3.2-BILLION OFFER WILL BE TURNED DOWN BY THE ICC AND WANTS TO AVOID RUNAWAY 
PRICE WAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Burlington Northern Inc. decided Thursday to stick with its lower offer for 
Santa Fe Pacific Corp. rather than try to outbid Union Pacific Corp., in what 
could have become an expensive railroad takeover brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern's board said it doesn't think Union Pacific's high bid, 
valued at $3.2 billion, will be approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, 
which regulates the U.S. rail industry. It said it plans to proceed with its 
merger application filing with the ICC next week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Union Pacific turned its unsolicited bid into a full-scale hostile 
takeover run at Santa Fe, filing a lawsuit that seeks to derail Burlington's 
$2.5-billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific filed the suit Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court against 
Burlington, Santa Fe and the members of the Santa Fe board. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific is seeking a judgment that would allow Santa Fe to terminate the 
merger agreement with Burlington and allow it to accept Union Pacific's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also requested an injunction requiring Santa Fe to negotiate with 
Union Pacific regarding its proposal. Santa Fe has already agreed to a buyout 
from Burlington Northern. 
</P>
<P>
 The elbowing between Burlington Northern and Union Pacific marks the latest in 
a merger frenzy aimed at stitching together ever larger and more efficient 
networks to take advantage of a resurgence of the rail industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific operates a 19,000-mile network spanning the West, Midwest and 
Gulf Coast regions. Santa Fe operates an 8,750-mile system that links Chicago, 
the West Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination would create a rail behemoth bigger than Burlington Northern, 
which already operates the longest rail system in North America, a 25,000-mile 
network spanning 25 states and two Canadian provinces. Union Pacific has 
acknowledged that the deal could give it a monopoly on traffic between 
California and the Midwest and wheat shipped by farmers in Kansas and Oklahoma. 
But it has offered to work out special deals with Burlington and Southern 
Pacific to preserve competition. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, Santa Fe closed up 87.5 cents per share at 
$13.50. Union Pacific was down $1.875 at $50, and Burlington Northern was off 
50 cents at $48.875.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS DROP AS TRADERS AWAIT JOBLESS REPORT

<P>
 Continued fears that the Federal Reserve Board will raise short-term interest 
rates soon pushed stocks lower for the fourth consecutive session Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.78 points to 3,775.56, its third loss 
in four days. The blue-chip gauge was down as much as 19 points near the close, 
but a flurry of last-minute buying erased some of the losses. Broader 
indicators of stock prices also dropped for the fourth straight day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors were sidelined ahead of today's release of payroll and 
unemployment data. Analysts expect government reports to show that non-farm 
payrolls increased by about 250,000 in September and that the nation's 
unemployment rate stayed steady at 6.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger payroll number or big drop in unemployment could send a signal to the 
Fed that the economy is growing too fast, offering more incentive to the 
central bank to increase short-term interest rates for the sixth time this 
year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow sank nearly 60 points on Tuesday and Wednesday combined, after reports 
of an optimistic purchasing managers survey, strong retail and auto sales and 
robust factory orders stirred fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 As jittery as investors are, Thursday's selloff showed little conviction. New 
York Stock Exchange volume was a light 271.43 million shares, down from 360.33 
million on Wednesday. Declining issues claimed a slim lead on advancers on the 
New York Stock Exchange, with 990 up, 1,128 down and 713 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market marched in place most of Thursday, fearing the impact of 
today's employment statistics on inflation. Stocks did not get much help from 
the bond market, where the Treasury's 30-year bond yield rose 0.02 point to 
7.96%. Its price, which declines when the yield rises, fell 5/32, or $1.56 per 
$1,000 invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither market reacted much to a government report that first-time claims for 
state unemployment benefits rose 7,000 last week, the first increase in five 
weeks and slightly above the 5,000 increase analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the dollar rose slightly against most key currencies in 
extremely quiet trading Thursday, as dealers waited for release of the 
employment data. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail issues were mixed following the release of September chain store 
sales figures. Kmart fell 1/2 to 16 3/4. The company said September sales at 
stores open at least a year rose 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 * TJX fell 2 3/8 to 17 7/8. The retailer said September sales at stores open 
at least a year declined 4% and were "very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Fe Pacific led the most actives on the NYSE and rose 7/8 to 13 1/2. 
Union Pacific offered $3.4 billion for the railroad after the close of trading 
Wednesday, in a bid to head off Burlington Northern's acquisition of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Union Pacific fell 1 7/8 to 50. Burlington Northern closed down 1/2 at 48 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quaker Oats fell 1 to 74 1/4. Smith Barney said it lowered its 1995 and 1996 
fiscal year estimates on the firm, citing softness in the European pet food 
market and higher spending on Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shares of auto makers were weak, with General Motors falling 1 5/8 to 44, 
Chrysler off 7/8 to 44 1/4 and Ford down 3/8 to 27 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei average slid 96.32 points to 
19.655.23, while Frankfurt's DAX average closed at 1,955.69, down 13.03 points. 
But London stocks closed higher, with the Financial Times 100-share average 
rising 28.1 points to 2,984.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index sank 28.63 points to close at 2,641.39.

AWARDS AGAINST BUSINESS NO SIMPLE MATTER; COURTS: IT MAY LOOK LIKE MORE 
INDIVIDUALS ARE SUING AND WINNING BIG, BUT THE POST-LAWSUIT REALITY IS MORE 
COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes it seems like suing a company is guaranteed to make a plaintiff a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 A secretary is awarded $7.1 million in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
Chicago law firm Baker & McKenzie, although she worked at the firm just three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 An 81-year-old woman receives a $2.9-million jury award against McDonald's 
after suffering third-degree burns from the fast-food chain's hot coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Big awards like these grab big headlines. But the public often hears little 
about the aftermath -- a judge cut the award against McDonald's to $480,000, 
and the Baker & McKenzie decision is likely to be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense from media reports is that the number of individuals suing companies 
and winning is increasing and that jury awards -- especially in the emotionally 
charged areas of employment law and product liability -- are climbing into the 
stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality, however, is more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, juries are sending messages to employers that discrimination and 
harassment at work are not acceptable. The number of awards is growing. But 
that's because jury trials and punitive damages in such cases weren't allowed 
before 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took time for those cases to make their way through the pipeline," said 
Christine Carty, a litigator with Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis who works 
in employment law. 
</P>
<P>
 In product liability law, despite some large, well-publicized awards, the 
number of suits has actually declined since the mid-1980s, and consumers are 
finding juries less sympathetic to their causes, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, one in two awards is either reversed or reduced by juries or 
judges, said Michael Rustad, a professor at Suffolk Law School in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 State courts, which handle about 100 times the caseload of federal courts, say 
that while 18 million new lawsuits are filed each year, less than 2% are tort 
cases -- those involving wrongful acts, injury, negligence or damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal court, of the more than 200,000 civil suits filed, only about 6% 
are product liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
 And product liability filings in federal courts, with the exception of 
asbestos cases, declined by about 36% between 1985 and 1991, according to the 
American Bar Assn. All tort filings fell by about 20%, also excluding asbestos 
cases, over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 But in discrimination and harassment cases, the changes in the Civil Rights 
Act have prompted individuals and lawyers to file more suits, said Ronald 
Green, a partner at Epstein Becker & Green, a firm that represents many 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Anita Hill's accusations against Clarence Thomas during his 1991 
U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearing have helped make the public more aware 
of sexual harassment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and local Fair Employment 
Practices Agencies received 5,623 charges of sexual harassment; projections for 
this year are running at almost 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, through the third quarter, the EEOC received 66,000 charges of 
employment discrimination based on race, sex, age, disability, national origin 
and other grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of those charges actually make it to trial, with most settled before 
lawyers are even contacted and others before a trial date is set. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, once a case makes it to court, the stakes are high, Green said. 
Companies are often unwilling to settle, in the hopes of discouraging similar 
actions, and plaintiffs who prevail can receive awards running into six 
figures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some observers have charged that many cases are often frivolous, with 
employees lured by dollar signs, Green said that is not usually the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers, whose compensation is often based on whether they succeed, will 
usually bring only the cases they think they can win. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, for plaintiffs, litigation is often lengthy and costly. And it's 
increasingly intrusive -- a plaintiff's sex life can become part of public 
record, a considerable deterrent to frivolous suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone bringing a harassment or discrimination suit should be prepared for 
possible character assassination," said Philip Kay, a San Francisco lawyer who 
won the California state court jury decision against Baker & McKenzie.

FEINSTEIN DESERT BILL HANGS IN BALANCE IN SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With 7.5 million acres of environmentally sensitive land hanging in the 
balance, the clock was running out Thursday on the California desert bill as 
supporters accused Republicans of sacrificing the landmark measure merely to 
deny Sen. Dianne Feinstein a legislative victory a month before the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The House was expected early today to pass the bill that would create two 
national parks and dozens of wilderness areas in the ecologically fragile 
desert. But the measure was sure to slam into a wall in the Senate, where 
forces were lining up to prevent it from coming to a vote before Congress 
adjourns for the year, possibly today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort is to run the clock out on it," said Rep. George Miller 
(D-Martinez), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee and prime backer of 
the desert bill in the House. "During debate Republicans were passing around 
news stories about (Feinstein's) reelection. It's pretty clear what the message 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) has vowed to keep the Senate 
in session until several pieces of legislation, including the desert bill, are 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to stay until we deal with the California desert bill," he told 
reporters Thursday night, "whatever the date." 
</P>
<P>
 But there will undoubtedly be formidable efforts, including possibly a 
filibuster, to stall the bill to death. After eight years of contentious 
debate, the desert bill was expected to become law this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Janis Williams, an aide to Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), said: "The senator 
will do whatever it takes to defeat the bill. He is trying to get our forces 
together to debate this bill all weekend if that's what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Versions of the measure -- which would be the largest public lands act of its 
kind in the continental United States -- have already passed with comfortable 
margins in the House and Senate. The compromise that emerged from conference 
committee Monday night was not vastly different from the versions that went in, 
and the votes are indisputably there to pass it again. 
</P>
<P>
 But with many lawmakers eager to adjourn, particularly those with difficult 
elections facing them in their home states or districts, time is the weapon 
that could kill it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a problem with the substance of the bill. It is being denied the 
people of California because some members want to deny Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
this victory. What they are denying is an opportunity to protect incredible 
resources, biological, cultural and recreational resources," said Norbert 
Reidy, spokesman for the Wilderness Society in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who has championed the legislation since she arrived in Washington 
in 1992, said this week that the bill's greatest enemy is Republican 
unwillingness to hand her a victory a month before she faces Rep. Mike 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) at the polls. But she held out hope that it would 
still survive. "It isn't over 'til it's over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the desert bill dismiss as nonsense the notion that Feinstein's 
reelection bid has anything to do with their opposition to a measure that they 
say is bad law. 
</P>
<P>
 "California politics is not the point," said Williams, Wallop's aide. "The 
bill creates at least two new national parks the size of Yellowstone and no new 
funding to support them. . . . If Congress is going to have an appetite for 
creating huge new parks, it ought to have a similar appetite for creating the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallop led other Republicans in an effort to stall the bill after the Senate 
passed its version in July. Critics say he tied it in procedural knots, 
prevented it from going to conference committee for two months and then doomed 
it to encounter end-of-session chaos that has been known to snuff even the 
healthiest legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the desert bill are faced with complex parliamentary problems to 
win passage. After it passes the House, congressional rules say the bill must 
wait 24 hours before it can be addressed by the Senate. That means that the 
Senate could not possibly take up the bill before Saturday -- one day after 
Congress is scheduled to adjourn so that members can campaign in their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents in the Senate are bound to further delay a vote with a filibuster. 
Although it requires just 51 votes to pass a bill, it takes 60 to end a 
filibuster. The longer the votes are delayed, the more likely it is that 
senators will just leave town anyway, eroding support for legislation that 
earlier in the session would easily have gone over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if passed, the bill will lack one of its original central goals, to make 
the East Mojave National Scenic Area a new national park. The version passed in 
the conference committee deemed the land only a preserve, where hunting is 
permitted, and there was no time left to argue the point without losing the 
bill entirely in the end-of-session crunch, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference version did include in the Mojave preserve 300,000 acres known 
as Lanfair Valley, considered a victory by environmentalists.

 Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike Huffington carried the 
animosity and tension of their heated U.S. Senate race into Larry King's 
television studio Thursday night during a live national broadcast of their 
first face-to-face debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange between the two candidates, who are nearly even in opinion polls 
on the race, was so acrimonious at times that their feuding was only 
interrupted by commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates -- and even the call-in questioners -- focused mostly on 
accusations that many Californians have seen on the 30-second television 
commercials dominating this race. But the debate also touched on some issues 
such as crime and immigration, as well some extraordinarily personal exchanges 
about religion and Huffington's wife's miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most heated confrontations, Huffington charged that Feinstein 
and her supporters have orchestrated a recent series of negative stories about 
his wife, Arianna, and her background in a controversial religious group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sick and tired of people jumping my wife," Huffington said. ". . . Are 
you going to make my wife's personal religious beliefs an issue? Yes or no?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying, . . ." Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes or no?" Huffington interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your wife is not the issue," Feinstein said. "I will answer the question as I 
want to answer it. You have said there is not much you can't buy, but you can't 
buy a record." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate offered many voters their first live glimpse of the two candidates 
because both have spent little time this year in major public forums. They sat 
uncomfortably side by side at a table across from King, who moderated the 
discussion without any traditional debate rules such as opening remarks or 
timed responses. 
</P>
<P>
 In news conferences after the broadcast, both candidates appeared with their 
spouses to present themes likely to be heard frequently in the month remaining 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) cast the race as one between a fighter for 
smaller government and the failed political leadership of the past. "Feinstein 
is part of the old guard," he said. "This is a new generation coming on. We're 
not government people." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein suggested voters closely examine her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to is, 'Who can you trust?' " she said. "When you get to 
the Senate, it isn't rhetoric. You go before committees, you testify, you get 
out there and fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The exposure was particularly important for Huffington, who still remains an 
enigma in the polls for many California voters less than two years after he won 
his first election to Congress. But for both candidates, the debate was a major 
event, coming at a time when the polls have showed a close race and time is 
growing short. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates took turns on the offense and defense during the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington was forced to defend his decision not to release his personal 
income tax records even though he's spent more than $10 million of his own 
money on the race and is likely to double that amount. He was also asked to 
explain his move from Texas to California in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington also kept a rapid-fire pressure on Feinstein, charging that she 
has been hypocritical in her claims to support tougher immigration policies 
because she supported a sanctuary resolution in San Francisco for Salvadorans 
when she was mayor. And he cast her election as a referendum on President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you like what Bill Clinton has done for the country, then you will like 
what Dianne Feinstein will do over the next six years," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 King also prompted a discussion of one of the major themes in Huffington's 
campaign, a plan to abolish the welfare system by turning it over to states and 
then, eventually, to private charities. Huffington boasted about legislation he 
has proposed to make it easier for middle- and lower-income Americans to deduct 
their charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But King, host of the internationally broadcast talk show, questioned the 
effect of the legislation, saying that poor people don't give money to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yes they do," Huffington responded. ". . . In fact, I've had some black 
people come up to me who live in the cities and say 'We need to help ourselves, 
give us the same tax deduction that wealthy people have.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she supported welfare reform, describing serious problems with 
the current system. But Huffington shot back that reform falls short of what is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical of most of the people in Washington, they're tinkering with a 
ship that's going down," he said. "We have spent $5 trillion on welfare. . . . 
It has been a bust. . . . Let's go back to where it worked before, and that's 
at the local level." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major contrasts that has developed in the race between Huffington 
and Feinstein is their philosophical difference about government's 
responsibility and the duties of a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has pointed to his welfare program as a way to shrink government. 
And he has defended his lack of a legislative record in Washington by saying 
that his job is to keep government in check, not to add more laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein sharply challenged Huffington's Washington record during the 
debate, citing his votes against key funding programs without offering 
alternatives. When Huffington complained about Feinstein's vote for the defense 
appropriations bill, saying that it cut too much from the military, the 
incumbent Democrat shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, maybe he really believes" the defense budget is underfunded, 
Feinstein said. "So I called the committee chairman. He has never submitted an 
amendment, never made a statement that defense should be higher. There was 
never a record." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he is unable to get legislation approved because Congress is 
controlled by the Democratic Party. But Feinstein said she has worked with 
Republicans many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with Republicans on border control and we got it, I worked with 
Republicans on legislation on assault weapons; I've worked with them on the 
desert bill," she said. "He could have made a fight. He could have at least 
opened his mouth. He could have had a press conference, he could have made a 
speech. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington protested when one caller from Los Angeles asked him to explain why 
he continued to live in Texas until 1991 when his wife and children were living 
at the couple's home in Santa Barbara. After accusing Feinstein of planting the 
question, the Republican candidate offered an inconclusive answer that involved 
his wife's miscarriage in 1986. After the miscarriage, Huffington said, he did 
not want his wife to fly back and forth between California and Houston, so she 
moved into the couple's Santa Barbara home with her mother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not say, however, why his wife did not live with him in Houston while 
he was working there at the family's oil and gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 When King noted that Huffington has been called a carpetbagger by his 
opponent, the Republican angrily responded: "It was an awful tragedy, my wife 
having lost a baby. Which is horrific. I can't believe you're challenging 
that," he said to Feinstein. "Have you ever lost a child?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Michael, please," Feinstein said. "Here is somebody who has not had any 
record in California . . . he buys a big house, his family is here, his 
children are here and he's not here, why?" 
</P>
<P>
 * RECORD DISCLOSURE: Feinstein's property papers also contain a racial clause.

LETTER HINTS AT MOTIVES IN CULT MURDER-SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first solid clue to the motives behind the murder-suicide of 52 members of 
an extremist sect in Switzerland and Canada arrived Thursday in a letter to a 
cult expert. In it the group said it was "leaving this Earth to find a new 
dimension of truth and absolution, far from the hypocrisies of this world." 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada, police in Quebec province said they found two more charred bodies 
in the rubble of a building that once served as headquarters for the group, 
known as the Order of the Solar Temple. In all, 48 bodies have been discovered 
in two Swiss villages and four in the Canadian town of Morin Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The typewritten letter, included with three other documents in a large yellow 
envelope, was sent to Jean-Francois Mayer, a prominent specialist in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, who has studied the apocalyptic group and knew its founder, Luc 
Jouret. 
</P>
<P>
 The envelope was postmarked from Geneva, 30 miles away, but the date was 
illegible. It was signed "Monsieur D. Part," an apparent reference to the 
French word for "depart," and listed a nonexistent return address in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer said he was convinced that the letter and the documents, titled "Transit 
to the Future," "The Rose Cross" and "In the Love of Justice," were from 
Jouret's group. The letter complained that Jouret and his sect had been 
"persecuted" in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have freed ourselves from the burden that day after day had become 
unbearable," the letter said. It added that the group was leaving "in order to 
achieve the seeds of our future generation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had asked myself until this morning whether this was suicide or murder," 
Mayer said Thursday. "Unfortunately, what I read here confirms the hypothesis 
of collective suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss authorities, who were continuing their efforts to identify the 
victims, did not doubt the authenticity of the letter. But they still suspected 
that murder, as well as suicide, played a role in the grisly demise of the 
Swiss, French and Canadian cult members who died in a farmhouse and two Alpine 
chalets -- all outfitted with sophisticated incendiary devices that were 
triggered by either a timing mechanism or a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire in Canada was set by the same type of device, authorities said. The 
four bodies there were badly charred and none has yet been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Swiss village of Granges-sur-Salvan, where 25 of the victims 
were found in the embers of two burned chalets, revealed that at least four of 
the bodies had been children, one as young as 5 or 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Gieger, the police chief of the Valais canton, or state, which 
includes this village, told a news conference Thursday that he saw the case 
"more as a collective murder." "I formally exclude collective suicide decided 
by all -- that idea is pure cinema," he said. "You can't expect children to 
want to kill themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Gieger said police found packed suitcases belonging to the 
victims in an apartment rented by the group in the village. Most of the dead 
here appeared to have been drugged or poisoned, Gieger said, and fewer than 
half suffered burns severe enough to have caused death. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Cheiry, Switzerland, where 23 other cult members died of 
gunshots and suffocation, investigating prosecutor Andre Piller said Thursday 
that preliminary autopsy results indicate that "a powerful product, not yet 
identified, was administered by either injection" or intravenous drip. 
</P>
<P>
 Piller also backed away from his earlier assertion that the farmhouse victims, 
19 of whom were found lying in a circle in an underground chapel, had died in a 
ritual, collective suicide. "Certain elements make us stay with this theory," 
he said, "but others make us think of an execution. We cannot exclude one or 
the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also said three rifles were recovered at the scene, though none 
was used in the killings. Fifty-two bullet casings were also found. Of the 23 
victims, 20, including a 10-year-old boy, had been shot at least once in the 
head or chest. About half of the victims also had black plastic garbage bags 
cinched over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the international search continued for Jouret, the 46-year-old 
homeopathic doctor who authorities and cult experts say led the sect and who 
may or may not have died with his followers. Jouret, who received his medical 
degree in Belgium and held Canadian citizenship, practiced medicine in France, 
just across the border from Geneva, until 1987, when he moved to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss authorities said Thursday that the Canadian government had asked them to 
investigate Jouret some months ago, but they had found no reason to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cult experts in Europe said they thought Jouret, if he followed his own 
apocalyptic teachings, probably died along with his followers in Switzerland or 
in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be logical that he died with his disciples," said Jean Vernette, a 
Roman Catholic priest in Montauban, France, and author of 30 books on sects. 
"But, then again, maybe not. He is human and, faced with death, he may not have 
been able to go that far." 
</P>
<P>
 No one yet knows if Jouret is among the victims of the murder-suicide. Police 
said they would continue searching for him at least until all the bodies had 
been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpol and Swiss police also said they were searching for two people already 
questioned in connection with the fires. An official described them as possible 
"witnesses," but he declined to say if authorities believe that the two were 
present at any of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret had been known to cult experts for more than a decade, though he had 
recently disappeared from view. 
</P>
<P>
 He was described by medical associates Thursday as a charming man and a 
competent doctor, though some said he often frightened lecture audiences with 
his talk of apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of associations here that have helped families extricate people 
from his sect knew Jouret as a rather more dangerous man who directed his 
attention to wealthy recruits from as far away as the Caribbean island of 
Martinique. Some sold all their possessions to join the sect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He chased families with money -- doctors, dentists, civil servants," said 
Lucien Zecler, president of Martinique's Assn. for the Defense of Family and 
Individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Granges-sur-Salvan, where no resident can remember a single murder in the 
once-peaceful town's history, investigators ended their search of a third 
burned-out chalet without finding more bodies Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As cow bells rang in the hillside meadow, arson investigator Jean-Claude 
Martin stood among the blackened remains of the house and marveled at the skill 
of the person who set the fires in the three chalets here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to talk of logic here," Martin said. "But the person who did 
this really knew about fire. It was a complete system. This person was very 
intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze at the chalet, which was the first to catch fire on this 
mountainside, had been triggered manually, probably by a match, Martin said. 
Five cars, apparently belonging to sect members, had been parked outside. 
Inside, police found charred literature, videotapes and other office material 
in a strongbox and an unscathed scrap of one of Jouret's checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 A small, wooden chapel next door did not catch fire. On Thursday, it was still 
ringed with curtains of red silk, and an altar was inscribed with one of the 
sect's names, "The Cross and Rose." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in Cheiry, where residents believed that the five permanent residents 
of the farmhouse were engaged in macrobiotic plant experiments, the residents 
of Granges-sur-Salvan, population 100, had long been suspicious of the comings 
and goings at Jouret's chalets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few residents remember ever seeing Jouret, they recall that many 
wealthy people, driving expensive cars and dressed nicely, frequented the 
chalets. The lights in the houses often burned until well past midnight, and 
several residents suspected that the people were involved in drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to my wife, this is not normal, all these elegantly dressed women in 
our town," said Leo Buset, 70, a neighbor. The retired insurance investigator 
added: "Everyone in town thought it was a meeting place for drugs or maybe a 
sex ring."

CLINTON CALLS HAITI MISSION A SUCCESS, PRAISES U.S. TROOPS; CARIBBEAN: CONGRESS 
BACKS OFF IMPOSING DEADLINE ON THE OPERATION, BUT DECLINES TO GIVE FULL 
SUPPORT. PRESIDENT SAYS HAITIANS 'ARE MOVING FROM FEAR TO FREEDOM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and his top aides declared the U.S. intervention in Haiti a 
success Thursday, seeking to persuade Congress and the public that the effort 
is working -- and that it is worth continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both houses of Congress, bowing to the Administration's arguments, backed away 
from earlier attempts to impose a deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops from the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate and House, persuaded by the Pentagon that a deadline could endanger 
U.S. forces, approved a resolution merely urging the President to pull the 
troops out as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The House also early today rejected, by an overwhelming 398-27 vote, another 
measure authorizing the operation until March 1 that would have allowed the 
President to extend that date indefinitely. Republicans said the 
Democrat-backed authorization would have been an endorsement of Clinton's 
decision to commit troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of White House efforts to win public credit for a military action 
that has gone well, Clinton visited the aircraft carrier Eisenhower in port at 
Norfolk, Va., and told sailors and aviators: "Thanks to your efforts, the 
Haitian people are moving from fear to freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on one of the nuclear-powered ship's giant hangar decks, the 
President listed the accomplishments of the mission so far: U.S. forces have 
disarmed Haitian paramilitaries, removed heavy weapons from the Haitian army, 
restored electric power to two cities, seized control of the country's radio 
and television broadcasting facilities, allowed the Haitian Parliament to 
reopen and restored the mayor of Port-au-Prince to his office -- "in less than 
three weeks," Clinton noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You brought a new day to a people who thought they would never get it," he 
said. "Your country is proud of you." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, other officials reinforced the message in a White House 
briefing, saying that a planned handoff of the U.S. mission to the United 
Nations next year is "on track" and praising exiled Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide for his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have established basic security," a senior Clinton aide said. "The 
capacity for organized, centrally controlled resistance is over. The capacity 
for violence certainly is still present." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the decision to use U.S. troops to police Haiti's cities, he added, 
the Administration is trying to maintain limits on their role. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission of our troops in Haiti is not nation-building," he said. "Our 
mission is to assure a transfer of power, create a secure environment . . . and 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Another official repeated the Administration's strong opposition to a 
congressionally fixed deadline for the operation, saying it would only 
encourage Haitian forces that want to stop the United States from restoring 
Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Clinton plans a news conference at 11 a.m. PDT today, in part 
to repeat the message that the operation in Haiti should be recognized as a 
major foreign policy success. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate backed away from setting a firm deadline when it adopted, by a 91-8 
vote, a bipartisan resolution that called only for the troops to be pulled out 
"as soon as possible." The House later passed an identical resolution, 258-167. 
</P>
<P>
 Relieved that the Haiti operation has gone off without incident, House members 
who last week were clamoring for an early withdrawal also rejected, by a 
225-205 vote, a GOP resolution that would have called for an immediate pullout. 
They set up another vote in January, when the next Congress convenes, to order 
a withdrawal within 30 days if it has not already been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting into the early hours, the House rejected the resolution authorizing 
the troops to remain in Haiti until March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it had passed, that resolution would have been largely symbolic 
because the Senate's refusal to embrace a withdrawal date would mean that it 
would not become law. But that still did not stop lawmakers on both sides of 
the Capitol from spending the waning hours of the 103rd Congress bitterly 
debating Clinton's Haiti policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning that Clinton should not take comfort from the fact the Senate 
resolution was bipartisan, Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Republicans 
oppose setting a withdrawal date in part because they do not want to imply that 
they support the occupation until that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Although even many Democrats said privately that they share some of Dole's 
reservations about "mission creep," or expansion of the U.S. role in Haiti, the 
constant, almost vituperative GOP criticism of Clinton prompted Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to complain that the Republicans seemed to be 
"disappointed" by the fact that "things have gone so well in Haiti" over the 
last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it. This thing has worked. Not a single American has been killed . 
. . and we are going to have a democratically elected government restored in 
Haiti," Mitchell said, noting that a number of Americans were killed in the 
invasions of Panama and Grenada that Republicans supported because they were 
ordered by Republican presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 As has generally been the case in his visits to military facilities, Clinton 
received a polite but not particularly enthusiastic greeting on the Eisenhower, 
where military personnel had waited nearly two hours on deck for the visit that 
began about an hour late. 
</P>
<P>
 While many applauded loudly as Clinton was introduced, others stood with their 
hands clasped behind their backs or thrust into the pockets of their 
dress-white uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 After the speech, much of the crowd left quickly, but hundreds stayed for 
nearly half an hour to shake hands with Clinton as the sound system rather 
incongruously boomed out Bob Dylan's anti-war anthem of the 1960s, "The Times, 
They Are A-Changin.' "

STUDY OF SEX LIVES FINDS SURPRISING CONSERVATISM; RESEARCH: DESPITE MEDIA 
SIZZLE, AMERICANS HAVE SEX AN AVERAGE OF ONCE A WEEK. MOST SAY THEY ARE 
MONOGAMOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The media may portray American culture as a cauldron of steaming sexuality, 
but the private lives of Americans are more like a comforting bowl of warm 
oatmeal. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-awaited landmark study of adult sexuality in the United States has 
found that the sexual practices of Americans are surprisingly conservative. It 
is a portrait of a land of faithful partners who have sex conventionally, about 
once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The research -- billed as the most comprehensive look at the subject ever -- 
disputes many widespread myths about sexual practices in the United States, 
researchers at the University of Chicago said Thursday. They added that the 
results will help Americans deal with a number of public policy issues related 
to the spread of AIDS, increasing numbers of abortions, teen-age sexuality and 
the future of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings: Although Americans have sex once a week, on average, a 
full third have it only a few times a year or not at all. More than 80% had 
only one sexual partner or no partner at all in the past year, and just 3% had 
five or more partners during that time. Only 2.8% of men and 1.5% of women said 
they were homosexual or bisexual, well below some previous estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 72% of women who have undergone abortions have had only one. This 
disputes the idea, the researchers say, that abortion is routinely used as a 
form of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also conclude that the high degree of monogamy, linked with 
the observed patterns for selection of sexual partners, make it unlikely that 
AIDS will spread through the heterosexual population in the epidemic fashion 
some experts have predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are contained in two new books, one for scientists to be 
published Monday and one for the public to be published the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study "is light-years better than Kinsey," the prototype sexual study 
published in 1953 by pioneer sex rsearcher Alfred Kinsey, Joseph Catania of UC 
San Francisco said. "It is a great leap forward," he said, because it provides 
the first look at the entire cross-section of Americans rather than at the 
limited, self-selected populations explored by Kinsey and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major advance over Kinsey is that they are actually investigating some 
specific research hypotheses rather than just tabulating numbers," said 
behavioral biologist James Weinrich of UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey counted how many people had sexual experiences in childhood. The new 
study shows how that affected their adult sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Edward O. Laumann, co-leader of the team that conducted the study, 
said the results will be "empowering information" to the vast majority of 
people who may feel sexually inferior after being exposed to the hypercharged 
eroticism of television, movies and advertising. "These images of hot sex have 
people saying, 'What am I missing?' This will bring the temperature down a 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The study involved 90-minute, face-to-face interviews with 3,432 randomly 
selected Americans ages 18 to 59, who remained anonymous. Only 20% of those 
selected for the survey refused, a low percentage for any national survey, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were questions about all kinds of sex acts, but the single question 
participants were most reluctant to answer, Laumann said, was "How much money 
do you make?" Ultimately, that question and one on the frequency of 
masturbation were placed on a card so that the participant could check off an 
answer and seal it in an envelope, hiding it from the eyes of the questioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Some results should be very encouraging to anyone who honors family values, 
according to Laumann and his co-leader, sociologist Robert Michael. Almost all 
Americans marry, and 75% of married men and 85% of married women say they have 
remained faithful. The people who have the most sex and are happiest with their 
sex lives are monogamous couples, whether married or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The median number of sexual partners American men have over a lifetime is six. 
For women, the median is two. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the items on a long list of sexual practices, only three were appealing 
to more than a tiny fraction of heterosexual Americans, and only one of those 
stood out. Heterosexuals universally find vaginal intercourse appealing and 
they include it in almost every sexual encounter. Watching a partner undress is 
a distant second in appeal, followed by oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12% of men and 17% of women in the sample reported having a childhood 
sexual experience with an adult or an adolescent over age 15. Those who had 
such an experience as children showed dramatic effects in adulthood, including 
more sexual partners, participation in more kinds of sex and more sexual 
activity in general. They also suffered significantly more sexual dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers to the masturbation question were also surprising. About 60% of 
men and 40% of women admitted to masturbating occasionally or frequently, and 
the incidence of the practice increased with increasing education and salary. 
The lowest rate was among 18- to 24-year-olds, who were not engaged in large 
amounts of other sexual activities either, and the highest rates were among 
middle-aged married people with an active and satisfactory sex life in the 
marriage. "This is just one additional thing they add to the menu," Laumann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found marked differences in sexual behavior and attitudes 
between men and women, but perhaps the most dramatic involved coerced sex. 
Fully 22% of women said they had been coerced into a sexual encounter, while 
only 3% of men admitted they had ever coerced a woman. "That represents a 
dramatic difference in the character of how men and women are interpreting 
events," Laumann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservatism explicit in the study is also good news for researchers 
hoping to block the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the 
heterosexual population. People tend to mate only within groups of people who 
are like themselves, Laumann said, and there are relatively few opportunities 
for sexual diseases to pass from one such group to another. "The risk of a 
heterosexual AIDS epidemic is (thus) very low," he said. "It (AIDS) is likely 
to be confined to the groups where it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 The study was proposed in 1988 by the National Institutes of Health by 
researchers who hoped to use insights gained to block the spread of AIDS by 
targeting the populations most at-risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives in government blocked it, however, perhaps fearing that its 
findings would appear to validate the sexual practices studied, Laumann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no recognition that a study could be conducted that would honestly 
report facts and observations that are subject to different types of 
interpretation," he concluded. Funding was eventually obtained from private 
sources. Backers included the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Henry J. Kaiser 
Family Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Andrew Mellon Foundation, MacArthur 
Foundation, New York Community Trust, AmFAR and Ford Foundation. How Often? 
</P>
<P>
 A landmark study of adult sexuality found that in the last 12 months less than 
one-third of Americans ages 18 to 59 have had sex with a partner twice a week 
or more. GENDER

FUNDING CUTOFF GIVES MTA CHIEF HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Franklin E. White on Thursday faced the toughest task of his 18-month tenure 
as head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority: how to persuade the 
federal government that local officials can competently build the city's 
subway. 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief tenure here, White has endured a nine-day bus strike, a lawsuit 
accusing the MTA of discriminating against minority and poor bus riders, a 
budget deficit and a litany of problems with the subway's construction. But the 
federal government's decision Wednesday to freeze future funds for Los Angeles' 
Metro Rail project will surely test his mettle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he was taking his latest crisis in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "As secretary of transportation and public safety for the state of Virginia, I 
had to deal with the escape of half a dozen prisoners from Death Row," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, White has demanded that contractors deliver what they are paid 
for. And he has voiced deep dissatisfaction with the private firm that inspects 
and helps manage construction of the multibillion-dollar subway. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "you cannot build anything of the magnitude or complexity of 
what we are building without occasional problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about mounting problems with the subway's construction, the Federal 
Transit Administration suspended about $1.6 billion in funding for the project, 
holding up plans to extend the subway to East Los Angeles and the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 White is an accountant and lawyer who is not afraid to confront controversy. 
During last summer's bus strike, he journeyed to the picket line -- with a full 
complement of police behind him -- to try to sell management's offer to 
striking mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 To resolve the latest crisis, White said that "all options are on the table," 
including firing the people involved in the subway project. One consideration 
in whether to replace the contractors is how much such a move would increase 
costs and delay the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, White, a cautious, pragmatic man, has tried to downplay the federal 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the word glitch to describe the federal action, and confidently 
predicted that the problems with Washington would be resolved by the end of the 
month. He also noted that work continues on other transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe absolutely within a very short period of time we will have the 
Federal Transit Administration agreeing with us on the circumstances under 
which we can safely resume the construction in Hollywood," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the system is up, no one will remember some of the bumps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the transit chief also appears increasingly frustrated and 
easy to anger when he sees the mounting problems with the subway's 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will happen in this world that you pay for certain things to be done for 
you, and they're either not done or not done well," White said. "And we're very 
upset with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his unflappable style, White's task of restoring the federal 
government's -- and perhaps more important, the public's -- confidence in the 
subway project will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, he has recommended courses of action only to be rebuffed by the MTA 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried unsuccessfully to reform the MTA by doing away with the Rail 
Construction Corp., an independent arm of the MTA that oversees rail 
construction. But his proposal has languished for several months because of 
opposition from board members, most notably Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion the board allocated millions of dollars more than White 
recommended for the Blue Line extension to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got an incredibly difficult job," said Richard Katz, chairman of the 
state Assembly Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, White, who earns $175,000 a year, must deal with 13 board members, all 
with their own egos and political agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever recruited Franklin for the job, to some extent, lied to him or misled 
him about how politically involved the board was and how much freedom and 
flexibility he would have to do his job," Katz said. "I think he expected to 
find a place where professionals were allowed to do their work without 
political interference or micro-managing from the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials blame White for not being aggressive enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were CEO, I'd say: 'OK, I'll follow the directions of the board but 
remember in four months when the bomb drops in your lap, don't start passing 
the buck to me,' " said MTA board member Jim Cragin. 
</P>
<P>
 Some transit board members say they are frustrated that White has not moved 
more quickly to root out incompetence and replace contractors who have not 
performed adequately. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissolving of the Rail Construction Corp. is no more than an incremental 
step, said MTA board member Nick Patsaouras. "Changing the theater alone is not 
going to do it," Patsaouras said. "You have to change the actors." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre, who has clashed repeatedly with White since the chief executive took 
over in spring, 1993, again criticized him in the wake of the federal action 
freezing future subway funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "His (White's) responsibility is to implement the policies of the board," said 
Alatorre, an appointee of Mayor Richard Riordan. "He spends too much time 
trying to undo it." 
</P>
<P>
 But White sees things as more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to make sure, as we go down the road, that we reach the right 
blend" of accountability and speed, White said in a recent interview. "And it's 
important we talk about that blend. Because if you overdo it, you cost yourself 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who came to Los Angeles after serving as New York state's 
transportation commissioner, said the latest crisis has brought him a sort of 
dubious fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my friends are calling me from New York asking me: 'What is this mess 
you've gotten yourself in?' "

COLUMN ONE; KENNEDY IN THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE; IS MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR OBSOLETE 
AND OUT OF TOUCH, OR IS HE AN INDISPENSABLE RESOURCE TO HIS STATE? MITT ROMNEY, 
A BUSINESSMAN, THREATENS TO UNSEAT HIM AFTER 30 YEARS IN SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy didn't stay too long at the dinner in this Boston 
suburb last Friday night honoring the visiting prime minister of Cape Verde. 
But as he left the hall filled with hundreds of immigrants from the tiny island 
nation, Kennedy paused by the door and leaned purposefully into Salah Matteos, 
the evening's master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep in touch," the senior senator from Massachusetts said with a sudden 
urgency. "We really want -- we need -- your help. Help me out." 
</P>
<P>
 As an assessment of his political condition, Kennedy's plea was poignant and 
precise. For the first time in an electoral career that extends back three 
decades -- into the mist of his brother Jack's presidency -- Ted Kennedy finds 
himself counting every vote -- and battling for survival. In a season that for 
Democrats feels eerily like free fall, this may be the absolute floor: The 
possibility that a Kennedy could lose an election in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's far from a certainty, of course. With a barrage of negative ads over 
the past two weeks, Kennedy has reopened a narrow lead over his articulate and 
energetic Republican opponent, businessman Mitt Romney, according to private 
polls conducted for business groups last week. But analysts on all sides agree 
those numbers could easily change again, and neither candidate is likely to be 
confident of the result until the last votes are counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is hand to hand combat over a very small number of undecided voters, and 
who is going to be able to motivate their voters to get a turnout," says 
veteran Democratic strategist John Sasso, who is advising Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both local and national currents have carried Kennedy into these unaccustomed 
waters. Revered and reviled as the bastion of liberalism, Massachusetts has 
seen a long-term cooling toward government, a weakening of Democratic loyalty 
-- symbolized by the enormous popularity of Republican Gov. William F. Weld, 
who is cruising toward reelection this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also an erosion of faith in Kennedy himself, as memories of his 
brothers have faded, and his own personal misadventures accumulated. "A lot of 
voters no longer identify with Camelot or the Kennedy mystique," said Barbara 
Anderson, one of the state's leading conservative activists. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has brought this slow slide in Kennedy's standing to the precipice is 
the unique climate of campaign 1994. Although President Clinton remains popular 
in the state, dissatisfaction with Washington and the hunger for change is as 
powerful here as anywhere else, and Romney is hoping to ride that wave all the 
way to the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for a change, you know that," Romney said as he greeted voters last 
Saturday at a fair in Topsfield. "He's been there long enough." 
</P>
<P>
 At 47, Romney personifies his theme: He is medium and message merged. He is 
slim and dark-haired, a successful businessman who neither drinks nor smokes. 
He has never run for public office and remains married to his high school 
sweetheart. Romney radiates crisp energy and confidence and looks as though 
life has left him entirely uncreased by reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy is the opposite, an inverted Dorian Gray, bearing on his red and puffy 
face the signatures of a lifetime of excess, disappointment and tragedy. At his 
side, his new wife, Vicki, adds both ballast and vigor; but she seems even 
younger than her 40 years, which oddly makes him seem even older than his 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy still campaigns with verve and presence. As he prowled for votes and 
amiably cooed with babies at the Topsfield fair just minutes after Romney last 
weekend, he looked neither demoralized nor spent. But with a limp from a 
chronic back injury, and 20 pounds too many strapped around his middle, the 
senator is something voters here have never seen: an old Kennedy brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, this election is about the meaning of that fact. The candidates are 
arguing about whether Kennedy is tough enough on criminals and welfare 
recipients, and about the implications of Romney's business record and even his 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last week, Kennedy suggested that Romney -- who's a Mormon, an exotic 
faith in this heavily Catholic state -- should be questioned about his church's 
exclusion of blacks from the priesthood until 1978. But after a firestorm of 
criticism from the local media -- and a dramatic press conference in which 
Romney cited Jack Kennedy's denunciation of religious bigotry in his 1960 
presidential campaign -- Ted Kennedy backed off, and issued a statement 
declaring that "religion should not be an issue in this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly they are arguing two sides of the same coin: whether Kennedy's long 
tenure in Washington has left him obsolete and out of touch, as Romney asserts; 
or, as Kennedy portrays it, an indispensable local resource, with the clout to 
deliver both sweeping legislative accomplishments and a bounty of federal 
grants and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic case of a race where whoever defines the battlefield is 
going to win," said Sasso. 
</P>
<P>
 First elected in 1962, Kennedy has now spent more than half his life in the 
Senate -- for better or worse, he's the only sitting senator who can say that. 
Over the course of his career, Walter F. Mondale, Howard H. Baker Jr., Lloyd 
Bentsen, Alan Cranston and Gary Hart have all arrived in the Senate, served 
their time and moved on. Only three sitting senators have held their seats 
longer than Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 While his presidential ambitions have faded since his disastrous challenge to 
Jimmy Carter in 1980, Kennedy has become an undeniable power in Congress, with 
a knack for constructing diverse alliances. Even while serving as the nonpareil 
target for conservative direct-mail appeals and political campaigns, Kennedy 
has made common cause with Dan Quayle on job training; Alan K. Simpson on 
immigration; Bob Dole on voting rights legislation, and Orrin G. Hatch on AIDS 
research and the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 To admirers, Kennedy blends a firm commitment to liberal principles with a 
pragmatic understanding of legislative compromise. To critics like Clint 
Bolick, litigation director at the conservative Institute for Justice, Kennedy 
remains an ideologue who shrewdly advances an agenda out-of-touch with 
mainstream America. On one point both sides agree: Inside the Senate, Kennedy 
is very good at what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the single most successful legislator in the place," says Sen. Joseph 
R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). "Teddy is viewed as the guy who has the most aggressive 
staff, is always able to deal with Republicans. He is the example of the 
quintessential legislator who, no matter how heated it gets, never lets it get 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Bolick: "There is no question, he is the ultimate Senate schmoozer. He is 
a very able negotiator who gives the appearance of making compromise while 
generally having a grasp of the issues superior to his opponents. There really 
has been no one on the Republican side who could go toe to toe with Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Through his career, no opponent, in fact, has damaged Kennedy as much as he 
has damaged himself, with a raucous personal life that seemed almost a 
malignant parody of the family history of unbounded license. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1969 accident at Chappaquiddick that claimed the life of a young campaign 
aide scarred Kennedy in a way that forever clouded his presidential hopes. His 
first marriage to Joan Kennedy ended in divorce in 1982, against a backdrop of 
persistent rumors of womanizing and drinking. He seemed to endanger even his 
Senate career on Easter weekend in 1991, when he roused his nephew and son for 
a late-night expedition to a Palm Beach bar -- an evening that ended in the 
events dissected and adjudicated in the subsequent rape trial and acquittal of 
his nephew, William Kennedy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 That fall, after sitting mute and embarrassed through the Supreme Court 
confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas that turned on questions of sexual 
harassment, Kennedy delivered a mea culpa speech at Harvard apologizing for his 
behavior; the next summer, he married Victoria Reggie, a divorced Washington 
attorney with two young children of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 With a Democrat in the White House, and more stability in his private life, 
Kennedy appeared sufficiently recovered that the state's leading Republicans -- 
starting with Weld -- looked at the race and decided not to challenge him. That 
left the GOP with only outsiders and newcomers led by John Lakian, a 
businessman who had lost an earlier bid for governor; Janet Jeghelian, a radio 
talk show host, and Romney himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Romney came from a good political pedigree: His father, George Romney, served 
three terms as Michigan's governor in the 1960s (he was first elected in 1962, 
the same year Ted Kennedy went to the Senate), ran for the GOP presidential 
nomination in 1968 as a favorite of moderates and served in Richard Nixon's 
Cabinet as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. His mother, Lenore, lost 
a bid for a Senate seat from Michigan in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 But since moving to Boston in the early 1970s to earn business and law degrees 
at Harvard, Mitt Romney had kept his distance from the clubby and cutthroat 
world of Massachusetts politics. Instead, he concentrated on making his fortune 
as a management consultant with the firm Bain & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, when Bain spun off a venture capital subsidiary, it placed Romney in 
charge. He proved to have a keen eye, and the firm prospered, with investments 
in rising companies like Staples Corp., the office products chain. Still in his 
mid-40s, Romney became a very rich man. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his wife, Ann, who first suggested last fall that politics might offer 
a larger purpose than accumulating even more wealth; by his own account, Romney 
pulled the covers over his head when she initially suggested he take on 
Kennedy. But the idea grew on him. Weld had shown Republicans could prosper in 
the state; moreover, Romney felt Kennedy's agenda had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the apostolic faith common to entrepreneurs made wealthy by their wits, 
he believed that unfettering markets offered a better prospect for solving 
society's problems than expanding government. "Ted Kennedy has been, over 32 
years, one of the leaders of a course that has not worked," Romney insists. 
</P>
<P>
 When Romney decided to run, Republicans exchanged quizzical looks: "We didn't 
know a single Republican when we jumped in in December," his wife, Ann, says. 
As a registered independent, Romney had voted in the Democratic presidential 
primary in 1992 to support Paul E. Tsongas (though he backed George Bush in the 
general election, he says). He briefly considered running for the Senate seat 
as an independent as well, his wife says, before rejecting the idea as 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 Independence and pragmatism remained at the center of his appeal, though. 
(Even today, he tries to keep his distance from a national Republican Party 
still held in some suspicion here: He has refused to sign onto the national GOP 
"contract" party leaders are pushing in Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
 Romney offered himself not as a conservative, but a Weld-like moderate: frugal 
on spending and insistent that welfare recipients work for their checks, but 
supporting abortion rights and gay rights and willing to ban assault weapons. 
Though criticizing Kennedy as soft on crime, he says he would have voted for 
the reworked crime bill that emerged from bipartisan negotiations last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 With that centrist appeal, a significant infusion of his own money and ads 
touting his claim that he helped to create 10,000 jobs through his business 
investments, Romney proved the class of the Republican field, and won an 
overwhelming victory in the GOP primary on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 the next morning, Kennedy's campaign welcomed Romney to the big leagues 
with the political equivalent of an inside fastball from Red Sox ace Roger 
Clemens: a wave of ads attacking Romney's business record, his campaign's 
central arch. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads accused Romney of making $11 million over the past two years, while 
his largest company -- Staples -- "provided no health insurance to many 
workers." Last week, the Kennedy campaign followed with more chin music: more 
ads accusing Ampad Corp. of Dallas, a company in which Bain invested, of 
slashing benefits, firing employees and provoking a strike at an Indiana paper 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Romney has challenged the facts of these accusations. Staples, he notes, 
provides health insurance to all its full-time workers; only part-time workers 
are not covered. And, while expressing regret at the Indiana labor dispute, 
Romney portrays himself as a bystander: Ampad acquired the Indiana plant only 
last summer, he says, long after he took a leave of absence to launch his 
Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, Romney tries to enlist Kennedy's criticism into his own 
indictment of the incumbent as an insulated career politician. "This is not 
Washington, this is the real world," Romney says. "Out of the 50 or 60 
businesses I have invested in, about three-fourths have added employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you say 'he's never had a company that's laid someone off,' that's just 
silly; 'never had a company that's failed,' that's Washington talk. It's very 
possible for a senator who's never had a job in his life, never hired an 
employee, to say, 'my goodness, there's a strike.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Romney's formulation underscores a skepticism of government Kennedy still 
passionately rejects. Almost alone among Democrats this year, Kennedy is 
running on the liberal faith that government can solve problems -- large and 
small. His ads cite his work on programs like job retraining, Head Start, the 
minimum wage and student loans -- and his success at raining grants and federal 
contracts on economically parched communities around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere he goes on the campaign trail, Kennedy matches concerns with 
programs as though completing a circuit. Taking to global extremes the maxim 
that all politics is local, he tells the gathering of Cape Verdean natives that 
he will fight to keep open the U.S. foreign aid office in their homeland. At a 
fund-raising dinner for a homeless shelter in Boston, he promises to help the 
organization seek funds from the new Violence Against Women act he helped to 
shepherd into the crime bill.  
</P>
<P>
 Three decades of such attention to the high and low end of legislative affairs 
has left Kennedy with roots in the state too deep and tangled to be easily 
extracted. At the homeless shelter dinner, management professor Paul Tortolani 
said that while he admired Romney he nonetheless planned to vote for Kennedy. 
"He still delivers," he said. "It's tough to deny that record over 32 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments suggest the huge task still before Kennedy's challenger. Romney 
can be a compelling campaigner -- on primary night he delivered a vivid call 
for a new direction that one Kennedy adviser described as "scary" in its 
effectiveness. And in conversation, he suggests an independent and creative 
streak -- for instance, advocating the merger of the agriculture and commerce 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prize in sight for both men, the next month will test not only 
Kennedy's endurance, but Romney's reach. Kennedy is weakened; but to finally 
topple the surviving heir to America's most famous political dynasty, Romney 
will probably have to cut deeper than he has so far. "The question changes," 
says John Gorman, an independent Boston-based pollster. "It's not just do you 
like Ted Kennedy. It's do you think Mitt Romney would do a better job as 
senator. . . . He can't just be the anti-Kennedy lever anymore." Election

JUDGE UPHOLDS SEARCHES OF SIMPSON BRONCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Handing another setback to O.J. Simpson's defense team, Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito on Thursday upheld repeated law enforcement searches of the 
football great's white Ford Bronco -- which turned up bloodstains, paperwork 
for the purchase of knives and an unscrewed light bulb that raised police 
suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also squelched a defense campaign to recall as a witness Mark Fuhrman, a 
Los Angeles police detective whom Simpson's lawyers have accused of racism; 
they also have suggested he may have planted a bloody glove at the Simpson 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the defense team had sought to put Fuhrman back on the stand as 
part of their effort to throw out evidence seized in the initial search of 
Simpson's home, and had argued that they should be allowed to recall him 
because they had only recently learned of past court cases and new allegations 
involving Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate effect of Ito's ruling on the Fuhrman matter is that 
prosecutors probably will be able to introduce several potentially significant 
pieces of evidence found during a warrantless search of Simpson's estate hours 
after the murders. Among those items was the bloody glove that matched one 
found at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Ito's rulings Thursday ended the courtroom battling over all but a 
few lingering issues in the defense's multi-pronged attempt to keep out 
evidence in the case. Prosecutors have prevailed on virtually every significant 
evidence dispute, and when Ito ruled in their favor Thursday, Nicole Brown 
Simpson's sister, Denise Brown, grinned broadly from her seat in the second row 
and mouthed the word: "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, in a rare public comment on the case, Brown had questioned why 
Simpson's attorneys were seeking to suppress evidence if their client is 
innocent of the June 12 killings of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
Simpson has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have long said that they 
believe the evidence in the case will establish Simpson's innocence. At the 
same time, however, they also have insisted that he not be tried based on 
illegally seized items and have vigorously contested the various police 
searches in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro said Thursday, however, that Denise Brown's 
comments are understandable given "the trauma (the family) is going through." 
</P>
<P>
 The disputes over evidence Thursday came as Ito and the attorneys in the case 
were rushing to tie up a number of loose ends before jury selection resumes 
next week. In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Barry C. Scheck, a DNA expert representing Simpson, accused prosecutors of 
delaying DNA tests and failing to turn over other material in order to gain a 
tactical advantage over the Simpson team. Prosecutors said they were not 
stalling and were turning over material as quickly as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito told lawyers he hopes to begin a crucial DNA hearing Nov. 1, and advised 
them that he is considering calling his own witnesses in addition to those 
called by the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court personnel said Ito had relented on a threat to expel reporters from 
the Daily News of Los Angeles. Ito had been angered by a Daily News article on 
the jury questionnaire being used to aid the jury selection process, but a 
spokeswoman for the court said the judge had decided not to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Before ruling on the issue of whether Simpson's lawyers could recall Fuhrman 
to the witness stand, Ito had his law clerk run a computer check of public 
court files related to the detective. That search yielded results in less than 
10 minutes, Ito said, adding that defense attorneys could therefore easily have 
conducted the same research prior to Fuhrman's appearance during the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is unreasonable for counsel, given the technological 
advances of today, for a critical witness to at least be run through a database 
to see what's there," Ito said. "I find that that burden has not been carried, 
and the request to recall Detective Fuhrman is denied." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro acknowledged outside court that Ito's ruling eliminates the defense's 
final attempt to suppress evidence seized outside Simpson's home hours after 
the killings -- including the bloody glove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's finished at the trial level," Shapiro said, though he added that defense 
attorneys still intend to challenge Fuhrman's credibility -- part of the 
defense team's aggressive attack on the integrity and competence of the Simpson 
investigators. Shapiro added that he believes the suppression debate raised 
"some real constitutional issues that need to be revisited," which would give 
the defense possible grounds to appeal if Simpson is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two search issues remain the subject of debate. One involves 
Simpson's Bentley, subject of a June 28 search warrant obtained by officers 
seeking to establish whether there was blood in that car. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind that search was that because Simpson had driven the Bentley 
immediately before the murders, the absence of blood in that vehicle could help 
bolster their case that he was cut during the killings, not earlier that 
evening. Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said that no blood was found in the 
vehicle, but a report still has not been written about that search despite 
rules requiring that returns to warrants be delivered within 10 days of their 
issuance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are attempting to prepare a case to present to a jury. We already are 
picking a jury," said Gerald F. Uelmen, who has led the defense challenge to 
the search warrants. "At some point, we're entitled to know what the 
prosecution case is going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said he was deeply bothered by the prosecution's failure to produce that 
report and deferred a final ruling on the defense's objections to the search of 
the Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 In disposing of the defense objections to the searches of Simpson's other car, 
the Ford Bronco, Ito removed an obstacle that could have blocked prosecutors 
from introducing a wealth of possible evidence seized from the vehicle. 
Detectives found the car parked outside Simpson's Brentwood home hours after 
the bodies of Goldman and Nicole Simpson were discovered a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors believe Simpson drove that Bronco from the murder scene 
and that the bloodstains inside and outside link the pro football Hall of Famer 
to the June 12 killings. 
</P>
<P>
 When the car originally was seized, police officers were armed with a warrant. 
But in the wake of that initial search, police returned again and again to the 
Bronco, conducting at least five searches of the vehicle and finding blood 
spots on the seats, floor, pedals, console and one door. They also recovered a 
packing slip for two knives, which Shapiro outside of court described as Swiss 
Army knives. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, police during one of the searches discovered that someone had 
removed the light bulb from the car's interior and had left it beneath the 
passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Tom Lange, one of two lead investigators in the case, testified 
Thursday that he considered the removal of the light bulb significant because 
suspects sometimes take out such bulbs to avoid illuminating the interior of 
their vehicles during the commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times, if a person wishes to keep the interior of a vehicle dark . . . 
they would remove the bulb," Lange said. "Consequently it was seized for that 
purpose as well as the possibility of fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen argued that the searches of the Bronco were improper because the 
warrant did not specifically authorize police to conduct repeated examinations 
of the vehicle and only identified bloodstains as the object of their interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers and other police employees conducted search after search with "total 
disregard of the search warrant, as though it doesn't exist," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a situation where the warrant does not specifically authorize 
subsequent searches for additional items, Uelmen argued that officers should 
have returned to a magistrate and secured another warrant. "It's as simple as 
that," Uelmen said. "And that simple fact seems to be one that the Los Angeles 
Police Department cannot comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clark retorted that police are allowed to search a car at will once it is 
in their custody, as long as the subsequent searches are legitimate efforts to 
find clues about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once an automobile is in the lawful possession of a police agency they may 
conduct reasonable tests over a reasonable period of time," he said, ruling in 
favor of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys may revisit the validity of some of the Bronco searches, 
however, by attacking lax supervision of the vehicle once it was in police 
custody. A tow yard employee allegedly burglarized the vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 With the efforts to suppress search warrants all but concluded, the two sides 
returned Thursday afternoon to the increasingly heated issue of DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheck, one of the nation's foremost experts on the legal issues surrounding 
DNA tests, accused prosecutors of stalling the tests in order to gain a 
tactical advantage over the defense. Eighty percent of the blood samples in the 
case were not sent out for testing until September, Scheck said, even though 
many of those samples had by that point already been available to investigators 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is tactical on their part without a doubt," Scheck said. "This is going 
to be a trial by forensic ambush." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheck, a combative litigator who aggressively attacked prosecutors Thursday, 
asked Ito to sanction the government lawyers for failing to turn over DNA 
material promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, herself a well-known DNA legal expert, disputed 
Scheck's characterization of the process and even his calculation about the 
number of samples that had been sent out recently: "If this an example of their 
ability at mathematics, we're in for trouble," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn added that investigators are moving as quickly as possible and are 
sharing information with the defense as it becomes available. "In no way, shape 
or form did the people wait," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case has progressed, Ito has grown increasingly frustrated with some of 
the media coverage and has scheduled a hearing for next month to consider 
barring cameras from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ito backed off another threat to bar Daily News reporters from attending 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley-based paper had drawn Ito's anger last week when it 
published a report based on a blank jury questionnaire it obtained before Ito 
publicly released it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the judge had said he considered the newspaper's possession of the 
questionnaire "felony theft of a court document," he decided not to pursue the 
matter, court spokeswoman Jerriane Hayslett said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just hasn't got the time to fight," Hayslett said. "He's got a lot more 
pressing things to do."

U.S. SENATE; BIAS FOUND IN FEINSTEIN PROPERTY TITLE; HUFFINGTON'S DISCLOSURE IS 
A MAJOR EMBARRASSMENT. ON TUESDAY, HER CAMPAIGN HAD CRITICIZED HIM BECAUSE OF 
SIMILAR COVENANTS DISCOVERED IN RECORDS OF TWO FORMER HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a major embarrassment for Sen. Dianne Feinstein's reelection campaign, 
Republican challenger Mike Huffington revealed Thursday that property records 
on Feinstein's San Francisco home contain the same racially discriminating 
language she blasted him for just two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington was called racially insensitive in a news conference Tuesday in 
which former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley disclosed that property records for 
two homes that Huffington once owned in Texas contained unconstitutional 
language prohibiting their sale to "persons other than of the white or 
Caucasian race." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, Huffington called Feinstein a hypocrite because similar racial 
language -- dating to 1909 -- exists in property records for the home that 
Feinstein bought in San Francisco nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come to you today after having endured two days of smears and attacks 
sponsored by the campaign of my opponent, Dianne Feinstein," Huffington said at 
a Washington news conference just a few hours before the two candidates met in 
their first debate. "Her only objective in raising this issue has been to stir 
up racial fears and manipulate racial sensitivities all in the interest of 
furthering her own political ambitions. But this time, Mrs. Feinstein has been 
caught in the web of lies and deception she herself has spun." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court outlawed racial covenants in property records in 1948, 
although real estate experts say the language has not been removed from many 
homes that predate the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials said that the senator was aware of the language 
in her property records and that she had filed an amendment to the documents 
specifically voiding the racial exclusion. Feinstein bought the home in 1985, 
and campaign officials said she filed the amendment when she first learned of 
the language in 1992, the year she ran for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein officials also said her homeowners association has hired an attorney 
to have the language erased from the record, a process that was not yet 
complete. Officials were unable, however, to provide a name of the attorney 
handling the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the campaign did not disclose that effort when it held a news 
conference Tuesday about Huffington's records, a Feinstein official said: "It 
was a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Bill Chandler said the Huffington and Feinstein cases "are entirely 
different situations" because the senator took steps to disqualify the language 
in her records while Huffington sold his property with the covenant still 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a case where congressman Huffington purchased and then . . . 
sold two homes and then the new owners took efforts to remove it," Chandler 
said. "Here's a case that Sen. Feinstein has a title deed that was changed. 
They're entirely different situations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican campaign officials said Feinstein has ended up with egg on her 
face. The disclosure gave them an opportunity to replay a long list of quotes 
from city leaders, community activists and Feinstein aides who have showered 
Huffington with scathing criticism about his racial insensitivity over the last 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
 It also forced some of the Feinstein surrogates who attacked Huffington to 
backpedal. Bradley, however, declined to retract his criticism, saying that 
Huffington's circumstance was different because he sold his home without 
removing the language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the presence of the restrictive covenant in your deed (that's the 
problem), because many have that," Bradley said Thursday at a City Hall 
gathering in his honor. "But what do you do about it? Before you sell that 
house, you ought to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Bradley said about Huffington's failure to remove the language 
from his property records: "I think it's more than just carelessness. I think 
it's gross neglect of his duty as a human being, to say nothing of his duty as 
a leader in public office." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Tuesday, Feinstein's campaign has held two news conferences to push 
their attack, one with Bradley and a second one Wednesday in which Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke was joined by a group of African 
American clergymen. 
</P>
<P>
 The covenant in Feinstein's property record said: 
</P>
<P>
 "That, it being designed to create and maintain in said Presidio Terrace, a 
settlement, community or neighborhood of persons who are on a social equality, 
the said lots shall not . . . be at any time sold, conveyed, demised, leased or 
transferred to, or be permitted to be occupied or used by, any persons other 
than those of the Caucasian or white race." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also denied in his news conference that the racially exclusive 
language existed on one of his two Texas properties. He said the language on at 
least one of the properties had been removed or expired. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he had never seen the language, since the property transaction 
was handled by surrogates. And he charged Feinstein officials with trying to 
mislead reporters by displaying his signature as if it were next to the 
separate document containing the covenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican consultant who does not work for Huffington, 
said Thursday that the Feinstein campaign raised the issue to get black voters 
to the polls. "The Feinstein campaign is desperate to motivate African American 
voters," he said. "But now it could backfire and turn off more Democratic 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
 At Huffington's news conference at the Ronald Reagan Center, the GOP candidate 
invited a conservative black columnist, Armstrong Williams, to stand alongside 
him, testify that he is not a racist and support his view that the restrictive 
covenants are not an issue anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new day in America," Williams said. "Let the past be the past. We must 
stop racial divisiveness."

MEDFLY SPRAYING IN VENTURA COUNTY TO START WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER and CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A six-month program of aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion will begin 
Wednesday over a 16-square-mile area of eastern Camarillo in an effort to wipe 
out the state's newest Medfly infestation, agriculture officials announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopters will begin night spraying of a sticky mixture of malathion and 
corn syrup over homes and fields in an area within a two-mile radius of a field 
where the Medfly infestation was discovered last week. About 29,000 people live 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The order to spray from state Agriculture Secretary Henry J. Voss came one day 
after an 86-square-mile quarantine was imposed in the county and discovery of 
more Medflies and larvae in Camarillo. The most recent find brings the total to 
58 flies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest single infestation found in such a short period of time 
in the state," Voss said while announcing the aerial spraying at a news 
conference in Camarillo. "Finding the larvae was a bad sign that there is 
another generation of Medflies out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the announcement of aerial spraying did not mention Gov. Pete Wilson, 
the governor's office made it clear that Wilson fully supported aerial spraying 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristine Berman, deputy press secretary, said administrative procedures 
require the governor to issue an emergency proclamation authorizing the 
spraying by helicopters. "The governor will sign the emergency declaration 
tomorrow and that will allow the helicopters to go into the air," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerial spraying, which will be conducted 10 to 12 times at two-week 
intervals over the next six months, is the quickest, most efficient and 
cheapest method to knock down an infestation, Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the best way to allay the fears of the county and state's 
agriculture trading partners, Voss said. Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in 
Ventura County; farmers produced about $850 million in crops last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is our largest importer, but we are also concerned that Florida and 
Texas will quarantine us out of their states, and possibly Louisiana and 
Georgia as well," Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Wilson aides said Thursday that the governor had no choice but 
to swiftly order aerial spraying of the potentially devastating infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to quickly spray would have invited an economically crippling embargo 
of fruits and vegetables not only from the infested region of Ventura County 
but from throughout California as well, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a notion, aides said, is unthinkable for the Republican governor who is 
campaigning hard for reelection on a platform of rebuilding the state's 
recession-weary economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, they vividly recalled the political damage Democratic Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. dealt himself in 1981 when he rejected recommendations of his 
scientific advisers and delayed the aerial spraying of malathion in an infested 
area of urban Santa Clara County. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay enabled the crop-destroying insect to gain a firmer foothold, 
provoked embargoes of California produce, cost taxpayers almost $100 million 
and severely undercut Brown's run against Wilson for the U.S. Senate in 1982. 
Wilson won. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Republican Gov. George Deukmejian also faced a Medfly crisis and 
ordered malathion spraying in heavily populated parts of Los Angeles County, 
provoking an uproar over damage done to car paint and fears of adverse health 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Wilson also ordered aerial attacks against the Medfly in 
the Norco area of Riverside. Aerial spraying concluded a few months ago, but it 
caused controversy among many residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of a Medfly infestation in Ventura County last week touched off 
an especially loud alarm among agricultural interests because it was the first 
time the pest was found in a commercial orchard, said Richard Matoian, 
president of the Grape and Tree Fruit League. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous discoveries in other parts of the state were made in back yard 
gardens and trees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is significant and it is scary," said Matoian, whose organization 
represents 85% of the volume of fruits and vegetables shipped out of the state. 
"We want to act quickly to prevent a trading embargo from our partners. For 
instance, they don't distinguish oranges from Ventura County from oranges from 
the San Joaquin Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Matoian said the Japanese are particularly wary of the Medfly. He and Clark 
Biggs of the California Farm Bureau Federation said if an embargo were to be 
imposed, Japan would likely act first and be followed by the Philippines, 
Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing figures from a recent University of California study, Biggs said Far 
Eastern markets in 1992 received about 62% of California's fruit and vegetable 
commodities that can play host to the Medfly. Those exports totaled $375 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs said agricultural interests considered the Ventura County infestation 
far more serious than the Riverside County Medfly situation. "It is an absolute 
potential disaster for California agriculture," he said.

WOMEN WITH AIDS FIGHT STEREOTYPES ALONG WITH ILLNESS; HEALTH: ORANGE COUNTY 
CONFERENCE STRIVES TO END ISOLATION BY PUTTING FEMALE PATIENTS IN TOUCH WITH 
ONE ANOTHER, OFFERING ACCESS TO EXPERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The college-educated woman, just 30 years old and already drawing a $40,000 
annual salary as an insurance underwriter, had modest dreams: finding a good 
husband, settling down, starting a family. She'd just met a great guy -- the 
first one, in fact, that she had ever really cared for. 
</P>
<P>
 All she had to do was take a test for HIV. No big deal. Just to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nine months have passed, she's still trying to shake off the shock. 
Not only did the test come back positive, she learned she already has 
full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great family, good friends," said the Irvine woman, who believes she 
contracted the disease in college from one of six sexual partners in her life. 
"Then all of a sudden -- bam! It basically destroyed my life. I don't even feel 
I have a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a woman with AIDS in Orange County -- where women account for about 6% 
of the more than 3,400 cases reported -- can be an isolating experience. Many 
women with AIDS and the human immunodeficiency virus that leads to it crave not 
just practical information, but some kind of connection to others like them, 
doctors and service providers say. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main purposes of the third annual Women and HIV conference set for 
Saturday at UC Irvine is to put women in touch with AIDS experts, and with one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-day conference was organized by the South Coast Medical Center 
Foundation and the UC Irvine Health Education Program because women and men 
often have very different experiences, both medically and socially, with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have been the forgotten group," said conference moderator Pearl 
Jemison-Smith, a former UC Irvine nurse who heads the Orange County HIV 
Planning Advisory Council. "There haven't been the services, the attention to 
details" that have characterized the response to AIDS in gay men, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although gay men have battled the stigma of AIDS with some success, women 
still "are seen as whores and 'those awful IV drug users,' " said Laguna Beach 
psychologist Valerie Gold-Neil, who helped start the annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more than 200 Orange County women who have reported cases of AIDS 
since the early 1980s, the most common risk factor is heterosexual contact with 
an infected partner, according to statistics from the Orange County Health Care 
Agency. Intravenous drug use is a close second. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials say the percentage of total cases among women in Orange 
County is only about half the national figure of 12%. But they caution that 
women's share of the caseload has been climbing.  
</P>
<P>
 As of March, 1993 -- the latest date for which figures were available -- 700 
women in Orange County were believed to be HIV-infected. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV is often the furthest thing from physicians' minds when they are treating 
working, middle-class women, one UC Irvine gynecologist said. But it shouldn't 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always surprises me how women will . . . be exposed, go to their doctors 
and have them say, 'No, you're not that kind of girl,' " said Dr. Beverly 
Sansone, who is scheduled to run a conference workshop on treatment of 
HIV-positive women. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, for women in particular, is that the early symptoms of 
HIV infection are not singular in nature. Unless a doctor has been trained to 
suspect HIV, a test might not be ordered until the disease has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine woman with AIDS, who asked not to be identified because she fears 
discrimination, said she had been treated by doctors for recurrent yeast 
infections, an abnormal Pap smear and shingles -- a virus that causes painful 
blisters along nerves. But "it never entered my mind that I could be at risk" 
for HIV infection and it apparently did not occur to her doctors either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you fall into some type of category, they don't even think" of HIV, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she would still be in the dark if it hadn't been for her new 
boyfriend's request that she be tested before becoming sexually involved with 
him. "I would have kept going, got an opportunistic infection and died," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to educating doctors about women's symptoms and needs, the 
conference is also designed to help women get what they want from physicians. 
Many want more information about -- and control over -- their treatments, but 
find themselves tongue-tied in the doctor's office, physicians and conference 
organizers said. Others wonder whether they should risk having children, who 
could be infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the medical and scientific realm, Saturday's conference also will 
address legal, ethical, spiritual and emotional issues. Comedian Suzanne 
Wilson, who has HIV, will do a closing presentation titled "Laughing in the 
Face of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said this year's conference will be especially attentive to the 
needs of minorities, including Latinas, who account for more than a quarter of 
all cases of AIDS reported among Orange County women. One address and two 
workshops will be in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very much trying to be more inclusive than ever," Jemison-Smith said.

GOVERNOR; BROWN CAMPAIGN GETS BACK TO BASICS; CANDIDATE TRIES TO RECOVER 
MOMENTUM BY HAMMERING HOME HER PLAN FOR THE STATE'S FUTURE. SHE SAYS GOV. 
WILSON LACKS SUCH A VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tacitly acknowledging that she must go back to basics if she is to win the 
race for governor, Democrat Kathleen Brown on Thursday launched a statewide 
campaign to convince voters that she alone has a plan to rebuild troubled 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 As she -- and a host of surrogates around the state -- handed out slickly 
packaged copies of a 62-page compilation of her speeches and policy positions, 
Brown also launched a fiery and quite personal assault on her Republican 
opponent, incumbent Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is a career politician," the state treasurer told about 1,000 
cheering students gathered in an outdoor amphitheater at Santa Monica College. 
"Wilson will stop at nothing, he will say anything, he will do anything to get 
voters. He has done it before and he is at it again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays on your fears, he plays on your anger, he taps into the cynicism and 
draws on the worst of our emotions," she added, "instead of reaching out and 
calling upon the best of California and trying to inspire our confidence and 
our hope for a better future. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not our Pete. He likes to divide, he likes to bully, he likes to blame, 
he likes to bash everyone from kids to immigrants to the President of the 
United States. And I'm here to say he's got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 But as much as Brown sought to tar Wilson, her campaign as much as 
acknowledged by its actions Thursday that it has thus far failed to establish 
her as a credible alternative for the voters of California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of her speech, with great flourish, Brown helped aides 
distribute copies of her booklet, titled "Building a New California." The 
candidate and her aides described the effort as a novel way to attract voters, 
but actually the packaged platform has become a staple of campaigning in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, however, such documents are used in the early, introductory phases 
of a campaign, when candidates are just beginning to build a rapport with 
voters. That Brown was distributing it with little more than a month to go 
before Election Day was essentially an admission that she has not yet made her 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Brown manager Clint Reilly acknowledged that the campaign has 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the equation is your opponent has a 2-1 negative job rating and yet he's 
winning election, it's very clear the problem is your candidacy is not getting 
articulated to the voters," he said. "It's clear we need to develop our 
candidate as a viable alternative for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 One persistent difficulty for Brown continued to haunt her Thursday, as U.S. 
Rep. Mike Huffington used a statement of Brown's to criticize her fellow 
Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The statement was included in television and 
radio ads aired by Huffington, who is challenging Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent National Journal article, Brown defended her personal opposition 
to the death penalty by saying that because of her principles she did not 
change her position for political expediency as had several Democrats, 
including Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown subsequently said that her statement about Feinstein was "mistaken." On 
Thursday, she demanded that Huffington withdraw the ad, and again said she had 
not meant to criticize Feinstein, who changed her position on capital 
punishment in the early 1970s, nearly 20 years before she ran for statewide 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole intent was to assert that while it might have been politically 
advantageous for me to change my position, I did not," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the strategic imperative of releasing her plan, Brown cast it in 
somewhat brighter terms than had Reilly, saying that it was meant to inspire 
voters to look toward the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is returning to where I began," she said. "My campaign has always been 
about restoring the promise to California families and rebuilding the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan repeats Brown's springtime promise to create 1 million jobs for 
California; it pledges a host of incentives for business, sets as a high 
priority the restoration of the state's schools and colleges and vows to make 
the state's streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet will serve as the backbone for the last month of the campaign, 
aides said. Beginning Thursday night, television ads touting it were due to 
appear around the state, and aides said that all of Brown's appearances and its 
campaign mailers would be tailored to reinforcing the contention that Brown has 
a plan, but Wilson does not. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Brown's opponent immediately labeled the release of her plan 
as a publicity gimmick from a "fairly desperate" candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing new here," said Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur, who said it 
would take a forklift to heft a compilation of Wilson's pledges for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is more interesting is what is not in this book," Schnur said. "What's 
not in this book is that Kathleen Brown is against the death penalty. What's 
not in this book is that Kathleen Brown is against the 'Save Our State' 
initiative. What's not in this book is that Kathleen Brown is going to raise 
taxes on the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the book does mention Brown's position on the death penalty with one 
sentence near the end of a 15-page chapter on crime. "I support three strikes 
for felons, one strike for rapists and as governor I will enforce the death 
penalty," it says. It does not specify her personal opposition, a position she 
has said will have no bearing on her handling of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The book does not explicitly mention Brown's opposition to the initiative 
mentioned by Schnur, Proposition 187, which would ban all but emergency 
services for illegal immigrants. But she does express opposition to the 
concepts included in the initiative, from denying medical care to illegal 
immigrants to dismissing their children from schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, both in the book and in her speech Thursday, Brown put forth a more 
moderate position than she had at times in recent months as she sought to match 
Wilson on tough approaches to issues such as crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 She forwarded a far more populist attack, in keeping with her campaign's 
desire to both ratchet up the enthusiasm of her partisans and inspire voters 
who have not yet made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to become a people's campaign, a people's campaign to take our state 
back from the special interests," she told the students, adopting the 
traditional approach of an underdog. "Take it back from the right wing of the 
Republican Party and take it back from Peter Barton Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's criticism of Wilson as a "career politician" mirrored a popular line 
of attack for challengers this campaign season, though it seemed an odd stroke 
from a woman whose brother and father could have been characterized the same 
way. She also sought to isolate Wilson from moderates, even those within his 
own party. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a record of catering to the right wing of the Republican party and 
he's got a record of catering to the moneyed and special interests while he 
taxes the middle class and balances his budget on higher education and sticks 
it to you," she said.

U.S. TO RELEASE IMMIGRATION FUNDS TO STATE; FINANCES: THE $33.4 MILLION WILL 
HELP DEFRAY EXPENSE OF JAILING UNDOCUMENTED FELONS. GOVERNOR CALLS IT 'A DROP 
IN THE BUCKET.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a sensitive political issue, Justice Department officials said 
Thursday that they will expedite payment of $33.4 million to California, and 
smaller amounts to six other states to help cover the costs of imprisoning 
illegal immigrants who have violated criminal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said the disbursement -- the first of its kind by any 
Administration -- follows pleas by governors, including California Republican 
Pete Wilson, that criminal illegal immigrants are an unfair burden on states 
because only the federal government can prevent illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said the initial disbursement of $42 million to seven states will be 
followed in a few months by an additional $88 million, of which California 
again will receive the largest share. The first-year funding for state costs of 
holding illegal immigrants was approved by Congress as part of the department's 
recently passed budget, with help from leading Democratic members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next six fiscal years, beginning Oct. 1, 1995, the massive anti-crime 
bill passed by Congress will give states an additional $1.7 billion for housing 
illegal immigrant prisoners. These funds, however, are yet to be appropriated 
by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's office responded to the announcement by calling the initial grant "a 
drop in the bucket" compared to the state's annual expenditure on criminal 
illegal immigrant inmates, which the governor's office placed at $475 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we would not even be seeing this limited federal money were it not for 
the governor's relentless pursuit of the President and Congress," spokesman 
Sean Walsh said. "California is owed substantially more than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh added that "Californians will not be satisfied until the federal 
government starts shutting off the flow of illegal immigrants coming across the 
border because otherwise the incarceration problem will not be solved." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, who is running against 
Wilson for governor, called the money an "important down payment in meeting the 
federal government's obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials acknowledged that the initial $33.4 million for 
California will only defray a small part of the prison costs but noted that a 
recent White House-commissioned study placed California's costs at $368 million 
a year -- substantially less than the figure cited by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that report by the respected Urban Institute, a Washington think tank 
with immigration expertise, added that California incurs significant related 
costs as well, including $1.28 billion annually to educate the children of 
illegal immigrants and up to $166 million in emergency Medicaid services for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from California, New York initially will receive $4.1 million; Texas, 
$2.1 million; Florida, $1.1 million; Arizona, $991,900; New Jersey, $600,600, 
and Illinois, $564,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno told reporters that the federal grants "are not meant to settle any 
lawsuits" that have been filed by California or other states to force the 
government to pay its share of costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These grants are meant instead to represent the first step on a down payment 
for what we believe is our fair share of the costs," Reno said, although she 
did not specify what the Administration believes its fair share should be. The 
department also will work with state officials on deporting some immigrant 
prisoners, she said. But Reno noted that deportation in the U.S. Southwest "may 
not be as helpful" because illegal aliens often cross the border again. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Associate Atty. Gen. John R. Schmidt said that money for 
hiring more local police officers will start flowing to California and other 
states next week. Schmidt said the department will start distributing the first 
$200 million and "California will receive a hefty share." 
</P>
<P>
 The recently approved anti-crime legislation provides for hiring 100,000 more 
local police officers over six years starting Oct. 1, 1995, but Schmidt said 
the first disbursements will be taken from previously appropriated funds from 
other bills "to get the program off to a running start." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has said that the funds, on a matching 
basis, will help him accomplish his goal of hiring 4,000 more police officers 
over the next five years, perhaps doing so sooner than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said 
funds for California and his own state for incarcerated illegal immigrants "are 
long overdue." He joined Reno at her news briefing as a key legislator who 
helped get the money appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The states have no power to enforce federal immigration policy and yet 
they're left with the burden of costs," Brooks said. "For the first time, this 
program is turning promises into cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who also appeared with Reno, said the money 
represents "a significant first step for the federal government in taking 
responsibility for its own policy." 
</P>
<P>
 California Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) also commended the 
Justice Department's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot overemphasize the importance of this to California, where there are 
between 23,000 and 35,000 undocumented aliens incarcerated in state prisons," 
Beilenson said.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / FAYE FIORE: CALIFORNIA DREAMY: CONGRESSMAN HUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By now Californians know only too well that in the eyes of the East Coast, 
theirs is the land of the beautiful people, a population so obsessed with 
appearance that the demand for tucks, lifts and liposuction supports a thriving 
industry of plastic surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 But truth be known, on any given day in the United States Congress, one can 
look down from the visitors gallery onto a sea of (mostly) men and wonder if 
there is a strand of natural hair color in the room. The view from upstairs 
reveals enough hair plugs and comb-overs to support the theory that Washington 
does indeed work hard at vanity, it's just that Washington doesn't get great 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 It is into this world of blue suit sameness, wingtips and general cosmetic 
mediocrity that California sent freshman Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah), a tanned, 
coat-over-the-shoulder, bolo-tied Northern Californian who was promptly dubbed, 
in political circles, The Hunk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his nearly two years here, Hamburg has been haunted (we use the 
word advisedly; there are those who would pay money to have this problem) by 
his good looks. Far less was written about his legislation to preserve one of 
the last remaining tracts of ancient old-growth forests in Northern California 
than about his Gentleman's Quarterly face. 
</P>
<P>
 People magazine dubbed him one of the 50 best-looking men in America; 
Washingtonian magazine crowned him one of the 25 sexiest. The Hill, a sort of 
political trade sheet, last month noted that although his hair has lately gone 
gray, he remains "the cutest congressman of them all." A New York Times fashion 
supplement featured him -- elbow hung casually on one knee, other arm against a 
tree, Capitol in the background -- as evidence that Washington is no longer 
anti-fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amusing. I'm not offended," Hamburg said of the attention, relaxing in a 
chair in his office, haircut effortlessly in place, shirt the color of 
cafe-au-lait setting off his tan. "But it is kind of sexist." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course it is; the world hasn't evolved that far yet. And Hamburg does 
have this sort of California mystique -- the rugged almost-shave, linen shirts 
(never white), sculpted cheekbones -- that even nose-to-the-grindstone 
political types find hard to ignore, particularly in Washington, where his 
staff says his looks are a much bigger deal than they ever were on the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime Hill staffer, a woman who has seen it all, remembered flipping 
through the book of freshmen congressmen when Hamburg's mug caught her eye. "My 
goodness," she said aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 At a post-election reception for women newly elected to Congress, the 
sophisticated, predominantly female crowd "parted like the Red Sea" when 
Hamburg walked in, recalled his press secretary, Meg Ryan O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mortified," O'Donnell said. "Only in Washington would that have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the jury is less than unanimous on the subject. Ask Cathy Riggs, 
wife of Republican candidate Frank Riggs, the man from whom Hamburg snatched 
the seat in '92 and who now wants it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a matter of opinion," she chortled when asked of Hamburg's hunk 
status. "It looks like the guy has poor self-esteem. He's always slunching 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 (It's true he does sort of slouch. But Hamburg admirers would call this a 
runway model's glide, that round-shouldered swagger that makes the really 
gorgeous look like they got that way without even bothering to stand up 
straight.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Hamburg's looks are worth mentioning in this political season is not 
the issue. Relevant or not, the subject keeps coming up. Riggs' campaign has 
even coined a little phrase responding to Hamburg's face. "It takes an ugly man 
to do an ugly job," they like to say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg -- married for 23 years to the same woman, father of four, grandfather 
of one -- is rather modest about all this. "I'm just an old geezer," he jokes. 
"I turn 46 this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he could put on something Navy blue with an ugly tie and blend right 
in. Nobody's forcing him to wear taupe suits and bolos so unusual they have 
become his trademark. (President Clinton even sent him one, with a longhorn 
steer on it). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hamburg's handlers say they make no attempt to exploit what God gave 
him, looks have always been a big factor when shaping a political image. The 
question is whether a candidate can be too good-looking, giving rise to the 
social mathematics that cute equals airhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good looks almost always help," said Joe Cerrell, a Los Angeles political 
consultant, noting that state Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) was once 
named bachelor of the month by Cosmopolitan magazine and his political career 
is still well-intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put your best foot forward," Cerrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in this age of electoral ignorance, when voters can scarcely find time to 
eat dinner let alone bone up on the issues, Hamburg's best foot may be his 
face.

BRAZIL PRESIDENT-ELECT CARDOSO PROMISES REFORM; LATIN AMERICA: HEALTH, 
EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURE WILL BE PRIORITIES, HE SAYS. BUT HE OMITS SPECIFICS. 
</P>

<P>
 Long on rhetoric but short on specifics, President-elect Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso came out of post-election hiding Thursday to tell the nation that 
education, health and agriculture will be priorities during his four-year 
tenure and to hint that he may reduce the huge federal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public workers are supposed to serve the public," Cardoso, 63, said during a 
nationally televised news conference from Brasilia, the nation's capital. "If 
they're not serving the public, their jobs will be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso, who declared himself the winner over eight other candidates, had 
vanished into the interior of his home state of Sao Paulo after casting his 
ballot in Monday's elections. Even President Clinton had been unable to find 
the next leader of the world's third-largest democracy for a word of 
congratulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial results show that the centrist Cardoso, a former college professor, 
senator and ambassador to the United States, took 54% of the more than 94 
million votes cast -- apparently on the basis of an economic plan he developed 
as finance minister earlier this year to halt Brazil's decade-long inflation 
spiral. Since the introduction of the plan in July, inflation fell from 50% a 
month to less than 1% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso, once exiled by the military for his left-wing views, vows to use 
free-market forces to narrow the gap between rich and poor in the world's 
10th-largest economy, where more than half of the nation earns less than $120 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso said he will push further with reforms to keep the country's 
anti-inflation program on track. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardoso, who as finance minister sought revision of the constitution to 
allow greater privatization, shied away from specifics about his controversial 
promises to sell off certain government-controlled industries whose proceeds 
could be used to help bridge the country's budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am committed to privatization," he said, "but we will sell (government 
agencies) when it is beneficial to Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 He promised that the country will not sell Petrobas, the mammoth and highly 
profitable state oil and gas company, though he said he favored joint ventures 
for the firm with private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 His primary message, however, was the need for health and education reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question of education is fundamental," Cardoso said. "Brazil followed the 
opposite model to Asian countries. We concentrated education in the (upper) 
class. We didn't generalize it for most of the population. Right now, it's 
embarrassing what we pay our teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolteachers in Brazil earn less than $300 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 With the country enjoying a degree of economic stability for the first time in 
nearly 20 years, Cardoso said, Brazil can begin to implement the programs 
needed to narrow the income gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter whether a program is popular or not," he said. "The 
question is whether it works. If it works, we'll do it. I am entering into this 
body and soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso's address was upbeat and diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main message was that 'I'm the one in charge,' " said Walder de Goes, 
president of the Brazilian Institute of Political Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said Cardoso skirted harsh political realities by focusing on 
sweeping pronouncements without presenting details that might offend some 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saying you're for better education and better health is like saying you're in 
favor of spring," said Alexandre Barros, president of Early Warning Consulting, 
a political risk analysis firm based in Brasilia. "Who's for keeping people 
illiterate and in bad health? . . . The question is, 'What are you going to do 
to accomplish those goals?' 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso may have been tentative, analysts said, because he does not yet know 
how to respond to pressures from competing factions inside the diverse 
coalition he molded in order to win the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Top politicians who backed Cardoso's candidacy told reporters that they were 
expecting prominent Cabinet posts for their associates. 
</P>
<P>
 A powerful leader of the rightist Liberal Front Party, or PFL, Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes, told reporters that he wants to see people from his home state of 
Bahia in "prominent places" in the new government, which takes office Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor-elect of Minas Gerais state, centrist Helio Costa, said he is 
counting on at least three Cabinet posts for his people. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters, Cardoso must maneuver his programs through a troublesome 
Congress, which has been an almost unmanageable assembly of 19 parties tinged 
by scandal and devoted more to regional bosses and personal interests than to 
solving urgent national problems.

POLITICS; BLAIR SAYS TIDE IS TURNING FOR LABOR PARTY; BY APPEALING TO A BROADER 
SPECTRUM OF VOTERS AND EXUDING CONFIDENCE, THE OPPOSITION LEADER RALLIES HOPES 
OF REGAINING POWER IN BRITAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The opposition Labor Party wound up its annual conference with a buoyant 
confidence not felt for years, its delegates convinced they are on the way to 
winning Britain's next national election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent in the past by party infighting, delegates this week rallied behind Tony 
Blair, their new leader, who gave a spirited keynote speech to energize the 
party faithful and bring in new voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say party members sense an unparalleled opportunity to regain power 
in Britain because the faltering, beleaguered Conservative administration of 
Prime Minister John Major has run far behind Labor in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Major still has 30 months in which to call a national election. Labor's 
strategy is to show that its leaders are moderate and competent, particularly 
in dealing with the economy, which the party hopes to make its core election 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In an address widely regarded as forward-looking and pragmatic, Blair appealed 
to a wide spectrum of British voters, rather than focusing on trade unionists, 
the poor, government workers and academics -- those who have formed the party's 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tide of ideas in British politics is at last on the turn," the member of 
Parliament told his audience. "For the first time in a generation, it is the 
right-wing that appears lost and disillusioned." 
</P>
<P>
 During the conference, Blair, an Oxford graduate, eschewed the usual cliches, 
offering none of the socialistic shibboleths or calling fellow delegates 
"comrades." Instead, he argued for realistic discussions on managing a modern, 
market-oriented economy. He proposed a package of higher employment, better 
education and an improved health system, a crackdown on crime and a pro-Europe 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blair pointedly avoided any details of how to pay for the programs -- a 
vagueness for which Conservatives criticized him sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 On more concrete footing, Blair, 41, went so far as to suggest that Labor 
consider updating its constitution -- including dropping Clause 4, which is 
inscribed on every party member's card. This clause calls for "common ownership 
of the means of production, distribution and exchange." It is a symbol of 
Labor's attachment to a collectivist past that favored broad nationalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, deputy leader John Prescott, and other senior members of the party -- 
having seen state socialism discredited in Eastern Europe -- are trying to move 
Labor into a position to deal with contemporary realities. They are opposed by 
militant leftists like Dennis Skinner, a member of Parliament, and Arthur 
Scargill, a miners' leader who described Blair's speech as "an outright 
declaration of war" on Clause 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-wingers narrowly won a floor victory supporting Clause 4, but the 
vote was non-binding and could easily be overturned in the future, according to 
political observers. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, though, the mass of delegates supported the new look that Blair 
and Prescott have been giving Labor as they walk the fine line of making the 
party electable while keeping it recognizable to the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran labor leader Bill Jordan, of the engineering union, declared of 
Blair's modernizing the party's basic document: "It's a 19th-Century 
constitution, and he was saying that people out there want one for the 21st 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair's widespread Labor support was, in uncustomary fashion, echoed in the 
conservative British press. Media here suggested that he was the first Labor 
candidate in 15 years who could pull votes from British Conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-leaning Daily Mail said: "Here, you felt, is a thoroughly modern 
politician in charge of a cussed old party, which he is determined to remake in 
his own image." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Independent suggested that Blair's journalistic nickname "Bambi" -- 
given him because of his pleasant looks, manner and message -- should be 
replaced by a new Disney-title moniker: "The Lion King."

CULT LEADER SHOWS HISTORY OF ELUSIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether dead or in hiding, Luc Jouret, the 46-year-old Congo-born cult leader 
who founded the doomed Order of the Solar Temple, is proving as elusive as 
ever, confounding efforts to fathom the nature of his organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper headlines describe his temple as a doomsday cult, a charge seemingly 
borne out by the death of more than 50 members this week -- 48 in Switzerland 
and four in Quebec. Specialists say, however, that, while in Quebec, Jouret 
never preached death in apocalypse but instead focused on survival of the elite 
after a cataclysmic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by complaints from parents of child cult members and from disgruntled 
former members, Quebec officials suspected that Jouret was up to something 
untoward but could never find evidence to prove it. Even a gun conviction 
against him proved so minor that the judge sentenced him only to donate $1,000 
to the Canadian Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret, a homeopathic doctor who received his medical degree in Brussels, was 
so persuasive and personable that Hydro-Quebec, the government-owned power 
company, paid him $4,394 in 1988 and 1989 to lecture employees on 
self-awareness and motivation -- and paid the employees $3,106 to listen. 
Later, when the cult fell under suspicion, Hydro-Quebec investigated his link 
to its employees but uncovered nothing illegal. When transmission towers were 
sabotaged, suspicion fell on the cult again, but no evidence was found linking 
members to the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrand Ouellet of the Center for Information on New Religions in Montreal 
told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that the deaths were puzzling because the 
Solar Temple did "not fit the profile of a Bible-reading apocalyptic group." 
Instead, he said, Jouret and his followers, while they were sure a terrible 
crisis was impending, envisioned themselves as medieval Knights Templar who 
would survive the crisis and lead new generations to a better world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yves Casgain, a researcher for Info-Cult, a private Montreal organization that 
studies cults in Quebec, agreed with Ouellet that it is a mistake to believe 
all such cults must follow the Jonestown and Waco examples and end in suicide 
and murder. In Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978, 913 cultists took their own lives. 
Last year in Waco, Tex., about 80 members of the Branch Davidians died during a 
battle with federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Casgain said in an interview that the Solar Temple group may have changed 
its view of the world after troubles in Quebec last year. He said this was 
implied in a letter and documents apparently mailed before the fires in 
Switzerland and received Thursday by cult researcher Jean-Francois Mayer in the 
Swiss city of Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer told the CBC that the documents show that the cult members believed 
there was "a wide conspiracy against them."  
</P>
<P>
 Casgain, who never met Jouret, studied the cult after various complaints were 
filed against it with the police. The accusers insisted that Jouret was forcing 
people to remain in the group against their will. "I found that there was a 
certain amount of control of people, a certain amount of pressure," he said. 
"But we could not find the evidence to support the accusations." 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret was born in the old Belgian Congo, now Zaire, and grew up in Belgium, 
where he was educated, graduating in medicine from the Free University of 
Brussels in 1974. He practiced in Europe, India, Africa, China, the Philippines 
and Peru but was not recognized by the Quebec Corp. of Physicians to practice 
in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period, evidently after a spiritual awakening in the Philippines, 
Jouret founded the cult. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret and his followers, mainly Swiss and French, moved to Quebec sometime in 
the mid-1980s. Jouret reportedly believed that Quebec would be one of the parts 
of the globe least affected by the impending and forbidding crisis that awaited 
the world. The cult bought expensive properties north of Montreal, including an 
old monastery on 100 acres of land that it turned into an organic farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret became a much sought-after speaker, especially by Montreal businesses 
that wanted him to motivate their workers. He published a book in 1992 titled 
"Medicine and Conscience," in which he wrote that people are worn down by their 
own egocentric perception of life. "Our bodies weaken under a constant stress, 
poisoned by fear of the future," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 His problems developed in 1993, when police began investigating the 
complaints. The most vocal complaint came from Rose-Marie Klaus, an ex-member 
who accused the cult of brainwashing people like herself and her Swiss husband 
into giving up their savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jouret thinks he's Christ," she told reporters then. "He told people that a 
great cataclysm is going to take place and that only the elected will survive. 
He persuaded several people to leave Europe, sell everything and invest in his 
project (the organic farm)." 
</P>
<P>
 Police put Jouret and the cult under surveillance, wiretapped his phones and 
even staged a raid that netted a few guns. The guns led to charges that 
prompted Jouret to flee Quebec. He returned a few months later, however, and 
was found guilty with two others of illegal arms possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret insisted that the guns had been acquired only to protect members, and 
the judge accepted the explanation, meting out fines that were to be paid to 
the Red Cross as contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Powered by the news of the bloody raids on the Waco sect, rumors and reports 
spread about the Order of the Solar Temple. The cult was suspected of being 
behind a shadowy group that had plotted the assassination of a Quebec minister 
and of destroying two Hydro-Quebec transmission towers. But no evidence was 
ever found. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that there are perhaps 100 members of the cult still in Quebec. 
Fearing mass deaths like those in Switzerland, officers have been posted on 
their compounds. Most cult members refused to talk with reporters, but some, 
especially those on the organic farm, insisted that they had broken with Jouret 
after he armed some members for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 There was shock in Quebec over the deaths of friends in Switzerland. In 
Richelieu, where the town flag flew at half-staff Thursday, colleagues insisted 
that Mayor Robert Ostiguy and his wife, who were among several Quebeckers who 
died Wednesday, could not have killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be murder," said town Councilman Michel Deroche. "I knew them too 
well."

7,000 BODIES DISCOVERED IN RWANDA GRAVES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mass graves containing a total of more than 7,000 bodies have been discovered 
in Rwanda, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The graves, side by side at Mabanza, about 60 miles west of the capital of 
Kigali, were believed to contain victims killed months ago, said Capt. Stephane 
Grenier, a U.N. military spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsi-installed government and U.N. peacekeepers based in nearby Kibuye, 
on the shores of Lake Kivu, were informed of the graves in recent days by local 
officials traveling in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 500,000 Rwandans, mostly from the Tutsi minority, died in ethnic 
bloodshed triggered by the suspicious plane crash on April 6 at Kigali's 
airport that killed Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundi 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutu militias blamed for the slaughter fled to refugee camps in neighboring 
countries after the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front rebel army seized power 
in July.

BOSNIA TROOPS KILL 20 SERBS; U.N. REPORTS MUTILATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government troops killed 16 Bosnian Serb soldiers and four nurses Thursday, 
and U.N. officials said some of the victims were mutilated, others were burned 
and some had their throats slit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government admitted its troops killed them but denied the 
bodies were mutilated. All 20 had been shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident on Mt. Igman, southwest of Sarajevo, threatened a U.N. agreement 
with the Bosnian Serbs that reopened the capital's airport to food airlifts 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasushi Akashi, the top U.N. official in the former Yugoslav federation, 
lodged a protest with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia-Herzegovina's Serbs, Croats and Muslims have all been accused of 
atrocities against ethnic rivals in their fierce 30-month war, but Serbs have 
been blamed for most of the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ejup Ganic, a deputy to Izetbegovic, admitted that Muslim-led government 
troops were responsible for the attack but said charges that the Serbs were 
mutilated were a "pure fabrication." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in the mutilating business, like the Serb side is," Ganic said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bosnian Serb military statement carried by the Bosnian Serb news agency Srna 
warned that "by this criminal act . . . a powder keg that threatens to inflame 
not only Sarajevo but a much wider region has been set on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeepers found the bodies Thursday afternoon at a Serbian command 
post just outside a demilitarized zone on the mountain, U.N. officials said. 
They said they believed the Serbs were killed Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs removed the bodies, which, Akashi said, "in many cases were 
mutilated or burned and disfigured." One U.N. source said some throats had been 
slit. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi said he told Izetbegovic of his "grave concern that some encouraging 
developments in the last 24 hours, including the return of prisoners and 
reopening of the Sarajevo airport, might be set back considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. plane landed later Thursday afternoon at the airport, ending a two-week 
shutdown imposed by Serbs in retaliation for a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization assault on one of their tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs and Bosnian government forces did manage Thursday to make one of their 
largest prisoner swaps of the war, exchanging at Sarajevo's Brotherhood and 
Unity Bridge 166 Muslims for 129 Serbs held by the Muslim-led government. The 
exchange took place after a nearly 10-hour delay.

MONARCHISTS DREAM OF ROMANOV RETURN; RUSSIA: A CROSS BETWEEN POLITICAL 
CONVENTION AND COSTUME PARTY, A MEETING LURES ROYALISTS OF EVERY STRIPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an ornate building near Red Square that was once the palace of Russian 
nobility, more than 1,000 monarchists gathered Thursday with the aim of 
restoring the Romanov dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian state needs a czar," thundered ultranationalist Dmitri D. 
Vasilyev from a podium decorated with a two-headed Romanov eagle, as 
black-robed Orthodox priests and men dressed in pre-revolutionary Russian army 
officers' uniforms cheered. "A Russian Orthodox Christian cannot but be a 
monarchist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cross between political convention and costume party, the first meeting 
of the All-Russian Monarchist Assembly attracted royalists from every political 
and fashion sect of the new Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Elegant descendants of Russian nobles, some introducing themselves as princes 
and counts, came in bow ties. Neo-fascists came in black leather jackets. 
Cossacks in tall woolen hats, teen-agers in knee-high leather boots, 
middle-aged men in White Army officer uniforms and Russian women in heavy eye 
shadow all gathered in a hall bedecked with 46 massive chandeliers to proclaim 
their royalist creed: "God, Czar and Country." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hallways, intrigue swirled among allies of the many pretenders to the 
Romanov throne last occupied by the slain Czar Nicholas II. 
</P>
<P>
 Though British and Russian scholars studying bones discovered in Yekaterinburg 
in 1992 have concluded that they are the remains of the czar and his family, 
murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, some monarchists are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading candidate appeared to be the Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, who 
is descended from Nicholas' brother, or her son. Thirteen-year-old Grand Duke 
Georgy Romanov was raised in Paris but enrolled this fall at the Nakhimovskoye 
naval academy in St. Petersburg. He is to spend three years at the academy, in 
keeping with a family tradition of military training for Romanov males. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other pretenders, including a Spanish citizen who claims to be 
Prince Alexei Vasilyevich Romanov-Dolgoruky, the slain czar's 
great-great-grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexei's supporters insist that Czarina Alexandra and three of her daughters 
survived the Yekaterinburg massacre and escaped, and that Alexei, born in 1946, 
is the grandson of one of those daughters, Princess Maria. They oppose any 
royal funeral for the Yekaterinburg bodies and demand an "unbiased" 
investigation of Alexei's lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even devout Romanov watchers could not say exactly how many other living 
relatives of Nicholas II might also aspire to the Romanov throne -- if Russia 
should decide it wants them back. 
</P>
<P>
 The monarchists hope to convene a "Zemsky Sobor," an ancient Russian council 
that elected the first Romanov czar in 1613, to decide who should sit on the 
Romanov throne -- or even whether the new czar must be a Romanov. 
</P>
<P>
 The monarchists admit they are not sure how consensus could be achieved in a 
Russia still deeply divided over its post-Soviet identity and its future. But 
they agree that Russia must have a supreme ruler to restore its spiritual and 
moral grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Russia starts to talk democracy, it ends in bloodshed," said Alexander 
Shtilmark, a 40-year-old geography teacher and leader of the Black Hundred, a 
pre-Revolution militia with close ties to the Orthodox Church. "It happened in 
1917. It happened last year, and I think it will happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Modern democratic election campaigns are based on deceiving voters with 
promises that cannot possibly be fulfilled, Shtilmark said, while a monarch 
would not have to lie to his people to stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The czar must answer before God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideas of the monarchist movement are a potent brew of Slavophilism, 
mystical Orthodoxy, nostalgia for pre-Bolshevik times, and the quest to rebuild 
Greater Russia from the shards of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in Thursday's audience said they favor a constitutional monarchy 
of the British sort. But others want an autocracy that would restore the 
primacy of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The monarchist movement also includes anti-Semitic groups such as Vasilyev's 
Pamyat, which means Memorial. In a speech interrupted several times by 
applause, Vasilyev exhorted the monarchists to protect Russia against 
"Zionist-Masonic intervention" from a malevolent West. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its extremist fringe, the monarchists' convention attracted key 
opposition leaders, including former Constitutional Court Chairman Valery D. 
Zorkin, former Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi and Russian Communist Party 
leader Gennady A. Zyuganov. 
</P>
<P>
 Zyuganov, who controls the second-largest faction in the Russian Parliament, 
did not endorse the idea of monarchy. But he warned that President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's regime is as fragile as the government of 1917, with a head of state 
as unwilling as Czar Nicholas to listen to anyone outside his sycophantic 
entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The czar was accountable to God," Zyuganov said. "Yeltsin, it has become 
clear, is accountable to no one."

JAILED MEXICO POLITICIAN TIED TO ASSASSINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An imprisoned politician with family ties to drug dealers was formally accused 
Thursday of helping to plan the assassination of his party's No. 2 official, 
and the attorney general's office said the plot is believed to reach higher 
into the political ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Three witnesses -- two of them also suspects -- have implicated Abraham Rubio 
Canales in what authorities have said was the plot to kill Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu. Massieu was the second-ranking official in the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), police said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu, the slain man's brother, said in an 
interview at a local radio station, "We believe that Rubio Canales has some 
responsibility in the murder, but not that he is the brains behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses had previously told police that Rubio Canales -- who is related by 
marriage to suspected drug dealer Raul Valladares -- wanted revenge against 
Francisco Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 He supposedly blamed Massieu, who was governor of the state of Guerrero when 
Rubio Canales managed a development agency there, for his conviction on land 
fraud charges. Rubio Canales is still serving out the resulting 14-year prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Eugenia Ramirez Arauz, another suspected conspirator arrested Wednesday, 
also told police that Rubio Canales had provided plotters with $300,000. Half 
that money was spent on buying arms and hiring a triggerman, drivers and 
lookouts to carry out the killing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the second major politician to be murdered in six 
months, was shot to death Sept. 28 outside a downtown hotel here. The 
triggerman fled when the gun jammed after a single shot. He was caught by a 
bank security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the web of suspects has expanded rapidly to include Congressman 
Manuel Munoz Rocha, his aide and various members of the aide's family. Many of 
those allegedly involved have turned themselves in out of fear of other 
conspirators, Mario Ruiz Massieu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz Rocha and the aide, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, are still fugitives. 
Rodriguez Gonzalez may be dead, Mario Ruiz Massieu said. 
</P>
<P>
 He discounted the likelihood that Munoz Rocha masterminded the killing because 
"he is not known for leadership characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Ramirez Arauz told them that Munoz Rocha and Rubio Canales are 
close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her testimony, police said another suspect, Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, 
told them that Rubio Canales was involved in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 A third witness, Filiberto Chavelas, who was not further identified, told them 
that he had heard Rubio Canales threaten to kill Francisco Ruiz Massieu on 
various occasions.

MANDELA CHEERED IN SPEECH TO CONGRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an emotional speech to Congress on Thursday, South African President Nelson 
Mandela said the post-Cold War focus of the United States must be on 
eliminating "tyranny, instability and poverty" across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela spoke to a joint meeting of the House of Representatives and Senate 
and saluted the role Congress played in helping to bring about democracy and 
the end of minority white rule in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised the enactment of economic sanctions against the former apartheid 
government -- over the veto of former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela brought cheering representatives and senators to their feet when he 
quoted slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of white rule, Mandela said, the South African people had cried 
out, "Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty."

HAITIAN POLICY PENDULUM KEEPS SWINGING, ANALYSTS SAY; CARIBBEAN: U.S. OFFICIALS 
WORRY ABOUT THE LACK OF CLEAR-CUT AND CONSISTENT GOALS. ONE CALLS THE OPERATION 
'THE HAITIAN SHUFFLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "I call it the Haitian Shuffle. You take three steps forward, two back and one 
to the side. You've moved ahead, but you're slightly off course." 
</P>
<P>
 This analysis came from an intelligence source inspired by a Latin dance tune 
playing on the radio as he discussed the problems and successes of the U.S. 
military operation here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The successes? Well, no Americans have been killed, there is relative order 
in the streets, and we've convinced the military and their friends that they're 
through and that (exiled President Jean-Bertrand) Aristide is coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems? There are too many domestic (U.S.) political considerations 
driving the policy, and some of the assumptions the planners used proved false 
or misleading. This has meant that each time we do the Haitian Shuffle, we've 
had difficulty in keeping the real goal in sight." 
</P>
<P>
 To this analyst and other sources -- including some U.S. officials here who 
spoke on condition of anonymity -- that goal is not just the return of the 
president but also the establishment of a genuine democracy, one that could 
survive any repeat of the Sept. 30, 1991, coup against Aristide.  
</P>
<P>
 "There should be more to our approach than just getting rid of the (Haitian 
military) high command and bringing Aristide back and even keeping Haitians 
from killing each other," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to build democratic institutions, an effective Parliament, a working 
justice system, a working bureaucracy. In the rush to meet domestic concerns, 
we're losing our focus." 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospects do not look good," a U.S. official said, "not good at all." 
</P>
<P>
 A prime example is the current Parliament and its efforts to deal with an 
amnesty bill that is supposed to protect the military in exchange for accepting 
Aristide's return. 
</P>
<P>
 Riven with jealousies and competing blocs and considered almost totally 
corrupt -- "You can't buy Parliament," goes a Haitian saying, "but you can 
certainly rent it for a long time" -- the Parliament has struggled with the 
amnesty issue, despite pressure from all three major outside forces -- the 
military, Aristide and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 An amnesty bill did win unanimous approval from the lower house of Haiti's 
Parliament late Thursday. But even after the vote, lawmakers were split on what 
they thought the bill could do. The bill must still be approved by the upper 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would most likely simply authorize the president to issue an 
amnesty as he sees fit on a limited basis, not a general immunity edict that 
protects the military for all its actions since the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't get this, with everyone saying they want it," the U.S. official 
said, "the failure won't bode well. Parliament is out of control. It doesn't 
represent anything. We have no leverage. There is nothing we can take from 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament "has to function if this (the American intervention) is going to 
work," the intelligence source said. "If it doesn't function . . . there isn't 
much we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the dismal outlook within Haiti, the major concerns of Haitian and U.S. 
experts are the narrow and brittle parameters set by what they see as 
shortsighted American political considerations driving U.S. policy here. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official called the domestic emphasis "the hand-off theory. We have to 
hand off Haiti as quickly as possible to the United Nations, to 
internationalize Haiti . . . even if it isn't ready." 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton is fighting opposition in Congress and a skeptical, if not 
disapproving, public," a Haitian political scientist said. "It is clear he 
wants to get in and out as quickly as possible, to pass on responsibility to 
the U.N. and claim that he solved Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The false assumptions under which the U.S. went into Haiti, according to a 
U.S. official, included the belief that U.S. commanders would be able to 
operate with the cooperation of the Haitian military and police, leaving law 
and order to local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a . . . change from the basic assumptions we had worked on for 
several months, at least back to May," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time "the approach had been hard," the official continued, toward the 
three key Haitian leaders, commander in chief Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, army chief 
of staff Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and Port-au-Prince's police chief, Lt. Col. 
Michel-Joseph Francois. "They were thugs, stooges, killers," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That all changed with the Carter agreement," he said, referring to an accord 
arranged by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter here on Sept. 18 that called for 
the resignations of Cedras, Biamby and Francois by Oct. 15 and the subsequent 
return of Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carter agreement made the U.S. operation "almost a partnership" with 
Cedras, the official said. "Cooperation sounds good, but it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Haitians continued the same brutal tactics that had marked their 
three years of power. This forced the Americans to focus on the short-run 
problem of ordinary police work, such as crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
 This was called "mission creep" by some U.S. military officials -- the slow 
expanding of the Americans' role into areas where they did not want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 But in preventing the Haitian military from using beatings to control the 
streets, the Americans left private property unprotected, and a wave of looting 
broke out. Again, U.S. troops had to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the disarming of anti-Aristide civilian forces, another task that 
was to be handled by Cedras and his troops. That did not work, and the U.S. 
troops had to begin weapons searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when a paramilitary group began to terrorize a section of Port-au-Prince 
near its downtown headquarters, the U.S. troops had to reverse tactics and raid 
the organization's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly," a U.S. official said, "the U.S. has been drawn into doing more 
traditional police functions than intended. It was a wrong assumption that the 
Haitian armed forces and policy would carry out these functions. Naive, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 An associate assumption, in the words of the U.S. official, "was the need to 
maintain the military as an institution: Every country needs an army, that sort 
of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear, said the intelligence source, that whether or not Haiti needs an 
army, "it doesn't need this one." 
</P>
<P>
 A corollary belief driving U.S. policy was that Aristide and his followers are 
an almost equal danger.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am afraid there is some fear that Aristide represents a radical threat to 
the conservative economic and political order of the area," a Haitian political 
expert said. "That is why (American policy-makers) want to maintain a strong 
and conservative military institution, to offset Aristide radicalism."

U.S. TROOPS CAUGHT BETWEEN POPULAR JUSTICE AND MOB RULE; MILITARY: SOLDIERS 
FIND THEMSELVES ACTING AS JUDGE AND JURY WHEN HAITIAN CROWDS PARADE THEIR 
ENEMIES TO THE NEAREST AMERICAN POST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man described as the military regime's most notorious hired gun in northern 
Haiti was turned over Thursday to U.S. Special Forces by a cheering crowd in 
the latest act of vigilante justice that poses a growing challenge for American 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning on two canes and suffering from a gaping wound on his hip, Jean Claude 
Celestin was led by hundreds of villagers to the two-story church rectory that 
now serves as headquarters for U.S. forces, who occupied this colonial-era town 
late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 American officers said Celestin was wanted in numerous murders in Cap Haitien, 
Haiti's second-largest city about 15 miles northeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in Cap Haitien knows him and hates him," said one of Celestin's 
alleged victims, Crecius St. Hilouire, who was interviewed in Cap Haitien. 
</P>
<P>
 Celestin allegedly burst into St. Hilouire's home in the middle of the night, 
pistol-whipped him, beat him with metal pipes and then stole his life savings 
of about $750. 
</P>
<P>
 Celestin had apparently fled to Grande Riviere du Nord just ahead of U.S. 
occupation forces and was discovered by residents who recognized and captured 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he was already wounded when they found him, and there were reports 
that he had been beaten while briefly detained by police in Cap Haitien. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, everyone would like to see him die," said Tony La Fleur, one of 
those who turned in Celestin. "But we are not seeking revenge now. He should be 
condemned to life in prison. If it were up to the Haitian military, they would 
never keep him in prison. But since the Americans are here, we hope to have 
better justice." 
</P>
<P>
 This was just one of scores of incidents in which emboldened, jubilant crowds 
in towns across rural northern Haiti have snatched their enemies, often from 
their homes or on public streets, and paraded them to the nearest U.S. military 
barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular justice to some, mob rule to others, such actions seem to serve as a 
catharsis for many Haitians who have had to repress their anger during years of 
brutal dictatorship. But they put U.S. forces in a tricky position as they 
struggle to define what is clearly an expanding police role. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time a new captive is delivered, the U.S. forces find themselves having 
to make snap judgments about potential guilt, about who is lying and who is 
telling the truth. When is a person being accused simply out of spite or old 
grudges, and when is the accused a truly heinous murderer who must be detained 
at all cost? Or when is it better to take the person into custody simply for 
his own protection? 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds also represent the worst nightmare for the elite and the business 
class. Violent vigilantism, called dechoukage in Creole, has a long history in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians recall the rampages by vengeful masses after the 1986 fall of 
dictator Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, and again during the government of 
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Those who supported the dictatorship 
were often targeted for the looting or burning of their homes or businesses. 
Some were lynched. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to let the crowds become a kangaroo court," said Special 
Forces Master Sgt. Stan Goeff, an intelligence officer who formed part of a 
U.S. team that occupied the remote northeastern town of Fort Liberte on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fort Liberte, Special Forces quickly arrested nine people who were 
identified as attaches , or paramilitary agents, and other supporters of the 
dictatorship. But in the hours that followed, roving bands of Haitian citizens 
did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by a couple of men playing drums and other musical instruments, 
they took alleged attaches from their homes one by one, tied their arms and 
escorted them through the dirt streets to the garrison where the Americans were 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 In numerous cases, the American GIs have had to rescue and protect accused 
attaches or other dictatorship henchmen from enraged crowds. In the northern 
border town of Ouanaminthe, two Special Forces officers on Monday plucked a 
paramilitary agent from the center of about 400 people who had surrounded him. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officers placed the man in the back of their Humvee, someone from the 
crowd tossed them a 12-foot rope. "They wanted us to hang him on the spot," 
Capt. Mel Metts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cap Haitien on Tuesday, a businessman crashed his car into a pro-Aristide 
march, injuring seven, including a child who at first was reported to have 
died. It was not clear whether the act was intentional. Residents responded by 
looting the man's business and home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Haitians in Cap Haitien and other northern towns, especially in the 
business sector, have begun to complain that the Americans are siding too 
quickly with the crowds. American officers say they are careful not to take 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Fort Liberte operation, among those arrested was Nyll Calixte, a former 
ambassador and head of the university law school. The Special Forces officers 
who took him from his home, handcuffed to his French-born wife, as a crowd 
cheered, said he had been identified as a prominent backer of the military 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Calixte and his wife were helicoptered to Port-au-Prince for interrogation. 
But on Thursday, the couple was released with a formal apology. "I think the 
American military went a little beyond the boundaries of justice," Calixte said 
as he sat in a U.S. military airport in Cap Haitien waiting for a ride home.

CIA DIRECTOR DENIES U.S. LINK TO HAITI ATTACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence agencies helped establish the feared Haitian paramilitary 
group FRAPH after the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the magazine 
The Nation said in a report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey denied the report in Washington with a terse 
"no."When pressed for an elaboration, he added: "When I say no, I mean no." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine said Emmanuel Constant, leader of the Front for the Advancement 
and Progress of Haiti, named his U.S. handler as Col. Patrick Collins, a U.S. 
Defense Intelligence Agency attache in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation quoted Constant as saying Collins began pressing him to establish 
an organization "that could balance the Aristide movement" and do intelligence 
work against it. Constant's discussions with Collins began in September, 1991, 
after the military coup against Aristide, and resulted in what later became 
known as FRAPH, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No agency of the U.S. government ever funded FRAPH, we never directed FRAPH, 
we never had any operational relationship with FRAPH," a senior U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said Collins was the defense and army attache to the U.S. Embassy 
in Port-au-Prince from 1989 to 1992 but was not in contact with Constant nor 
was he at the headquarters of the coup leaders at the time Aristide was 
toppled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation report also said documentary evidence confirmed in part by Constant 
indicates that a group of attaches , or paramilitaries, have been paid for 
several years by a U.S.-funded project that keeps files on the movements of 
Haiti's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey's denial followed a closed meeting with the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. Not all senators were satisfied with his denial, although committee 
Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) said he was.

HAITIAN WAREHOUSE OWNER KILLS LOOTER

 The owner of a warehouse in Port-au-Prince fired on looters Thursday, killing 
one person as U.S. forces were called in to calm the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to lose anymore," said Alan Francillon, the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Looting, which has devastated properties in the port area, is moving into 
other parts of the capital as civilians, emboldened by the lack of local 
security from either the feared police force or the army, perform a daily 
ritual of destruction.

GOP FILIBUSTER ALL BUT KILLS LOBBY REFORM; LEGISLATION: SENATE REPUBLICANS SAY 
THEY WOULD BACK GIFT BAN AS A SEPARATE BILL. THEY OBJECT TO REGULATIONS DEALING 
WITH GRASS-ROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A bill to curb the influence of lobbyists was all but killed in the Senate on 
Thursday, the victim of one of a half dozen filibusters that Republicans have 
been using to delay or defeat Democratic initiatives in the waning hours of the 
103rd Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Senate passed the legislation by an overwhelming majority earlier 
in the session, sponsors fell eight votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a 
GOP filibuster blocking final passage. The measure would tighten financial 
disclosure requirements for lobbyists and bar them from giving gifts or 
providing free travel and entertainment to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of both the House and Senate are continuing to discuss possibly making 
one final effort to salvage the bill or at least part of it, by changing 
lobbying disclosure requirements that Republicans oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 Denying Democratic charges that they were being almost blindly obstructionist, 
the Republicans offered to support the gift ban if it were brought back as a 
separate bill without the other lobbying provisions to which they were raising 
last-minute objections. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the mood on the eve of adjournment turned progressively more partisan 
and bitter, angry Democrats were showing no inclination to give the Republicans 
political cover for what has clearly been a strategy aimed at blocking almost 
every major measure, apparently in the belief that voter discontent with 
Congress will work to GOP advantage in the Nov. 8 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 They offered instead to drop the offending provisions, which dealt with 
regulations for grass-roots lobbying organizations, if the Republicans would 
pass the rest of the legislation intact. However, making it clear that he 
viewed the GOP objections as a "smokescreen" to hide their efforts to kill the 
bill, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) indicated that he did 
not expect the Republicans to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 With Congress nearing adjournment, the chief House and Senate sponsors of the 
lobbying bill said that there would not be enough time, in any case, to 
negotiate significant changes. They said that the legislation was effectively 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Republican-led filibuster has apparently killed the best chance in 40 years 
. . . to enact a tough lobbying reform and gift-ban law," said Sen. Carl Levin 
(D-Mich.), who sponsored the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have killed it," said Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.), Levin's 
counterpart in the House. "They have preserved their free meals and free 
tickets and free golf outings for another two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 52 to 46 on the cloture motion, as seven moderate Republicans 
sided with 45 Democrats, including California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne 
Feinstein, in voting to end the filibuster. They were opposed by 10 Democrats 
and 36 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbying bill, which would ban virtually all gifts from lobbyists and put 
an end to the much criticized junkets and charity sporting events in which many 
lawmakers participate, was one of three reform bills the Democrats hoped would 
bolster their standings in the polls this November by convincing voters that 
Congress is serious about restricting the influence of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two bills, measures to streamline the congressional bureaucracy and 
change the way political campaigns are financed, also died in the Senate, 
largely because of Republican opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats charged that Republicans were simply trying to keep anything on 
President Clinton's legislative agenda from passing Congress before the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, however, said that their objections have nothing to do with the 
gift ban but with another provision which they feared might impose unfair 
restrictions on grass-roots lobbying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by this interpretation of the disclosure requirements, major lobbying 
groups, including the conservative Christian Coalition and the American Civil 
Liberties Union, joined a campaign against the bill mounted last week by House 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and other GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Gingrich's complaints, the lobbyists argued that the disclosure 
requirements could oblige grass-roots groups that lobby Congress to reveal the 
names of their members and even require ordinary individuals who call to bend 
the ear of their representatives to register as lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, however, charged that those interpretations amounted to distortions and 
"deliberate disinformation" put out by Republicans to "scare people into 
opposing the bill." He said that the registration requirements would apply only 
to paid professional lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that Gingrich and other GOP leaders were only trying to keep 
Democrats from claiming credit for their reform efforts. He noted that 
Republicans overwhelmingly supported the disclosure provisions when the Senate 
passed the lobbying reform bill on a 95-2 vote last year. The gift ban, which 
subsequently was folded into the lobbying legislation when it emerged from a 
conference with the House, cleared the Senate, 95 to 4, last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last-minute surge of opposition -- from conservative Christian 
organizations, radio talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and business groups 
like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- convinced even some Democrats to support 
the GOP filibuster.

CIA CHIEF TELLS OF EFFORTS TO RESHAPE CLANDESTINE SERVICE; INTELLIGENCE: 
WOOLSEY REACTS TO CRITICS OF HIS ACTIONS AFTER AMES SCANDAL. HE SAYS AGENCY 
WILL EXERT MORE CONTROL OVER COVERT DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey, stung by criticism over disciplinary actions 
that he took after the most damaging intelligence breach in CIA history, went 
public Thursday with his attempts to recast the agency's covert operations 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Woolsey said that the agency will exercise greater control 
over the clandestine service, known officially as the Directorate of 
Operations, which generally has functioned as an independent fiefdom within the 
CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Woolsey said that he will strive to establish "a corporate 
sense of responsibility and an attitude in which everybody pulls together on 
substantive problems, as distinct from defending his or her own little 
bailiwick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change is going to take time to implement," Woolsey said of the reforms 
to the operations directorate, the branch of the agency that allowed Aldrich H. 
Ames, a drunken, often bungling CIA veteran, to steal and sell highly sensitive 
secrets to the Soviet Union and later to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took the Directorate of Operations four decades or so to get into a 
situation such that an Ames could slide by," Woolsey said. "Some change has 
begun but a good deal more needs to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically speaking, I think it will be within the first half decade of 
the 21st Century -- five to 10 years from now -- before people really know 
whether or not some of these changes are having the effect I want," Woolsey 
said. "Substantial cultural change in an institution, when you're trying to 
maintain the best of it and deter or do away with the destructive aspects, 
takes time." 
</P>
<P>
 Changes that Woolsey has ordered for the Directorate of Operations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Basing promotions on the value of intelligence an agent produces and the 
security of operations he conducts, rather than the number of agents recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 * Having intelligence officers file evaluation reports on their immediate 
superiors, an "upward feedback" without precedent and designed to ensure that 
performance is evaluated bottom-up as well as top-down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing evaluation boards to assess at specific stages in an 
individual's career his suitability, continued employment and career 
opportunities in the clandestine service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing the insularity of CIA officials managing overseas work by having 
performance standard teams call on them to advise them about policy issues and 
their overall performance. The teams will report directly to Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
 * Counterintelligence training for clandestine officers, both when they join 
the agency and at mid-career points. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey detailed the changes in closed-door briefings with the House 
Intelligence Committee Wednesday and its Senate counterpart Thursday. 
Afterward, staff and some committee members said that they either needed more 
information or more time before making a judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to tell if they (Woolsey's steps) are curative," said a member 
of the House Intelligence Committee staff. "The members gave Mr. Woolsey good 
marks for recognizing something needs to be done to change the culture out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), Senate Intelligence Committee chairman and 
one of Woolsey's sharpest critics, said that the director will be called back 
next week because time constraints permitted just three senators to question 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini said that it would be "unfair to judge" the changes until he gets 
answers to his questions, which center on "how this is going to change the 
culture and the problems that clearly exist there." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey announced last week that he was reprimanding 11 current and former 
senior intelligence officials for their roles in failing to help detect Ames' 
spying. Critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere questioned whether those steps 
were adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview Thursday, Woolsey vigorously defended his disciplinary 
decisions. He also gave no indication that he was considering stepping down as 
director of central intelligence. A CIA official said that Woolsey had planned 
to carry out the changes without fanfare but chose to discuss them to counter 
the recent criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the report of the CIA inspector general on the Ames case, 
Woolsey said he decided that four individuals "whose failure to take action or 
whose negligence constituted serious enough failures that, were they still with 
the CIA, they would have been dismissed or asked to retire." 
</P>
<P>
 But three had already retired and the fourth did so two days after his 
findings, Woolsey said. "You can't fire people who are retired." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the four officers still on active duty who were reprimanded for not 
acting as aggressively in the Ames case as Woolsey would have preferred, he 
said: "I felt that a reprimand was all that was just." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Directorate of Operations was grossly negligent, and much of the way it 
worked and works needs to be changed," he said. "But that is a different thing 
than in my judgment falsely visiting retribution on individuals 
disproportionate to the actions they took." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said that he is moving to create "a much closer partnership" between 
the Operations and Intelligence Directorates.

1.3 MILLION MORE DROP INTO POVERTY; ECONOMY: THE OFFICIALLY POOR TOTAL 39.3 
MILLION, CENSUS BUREAU SAYS. MIDDLE CLASS LOSES GROUND AS THE RICHEST GROW 
WEALTHIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a growing economy, another 1.3 million people fell below the federal 
poverty line last year and the economic divide between rich and poor Americans 
continued to swell, the Census Bureau reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 39.3 million Americans, or 15.1% of the population, lived in 
poverty in 1993, up from 14.8% in 1992 and the highest rate since 1983, when 
the economy was emerging from its deepest recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures reveal the uneven impact of the economy's rebound as poor 
Americans have experienced severe setbacks and the middle class has continued 
to lose ground, while the nation's wealthiest 20% have grown substantially more 
affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureau officials defined poverty in 1993 as an income of $14,763 for a family 
of four. They said that the 15.1% poverty rate was "not statistically 
different" from 1992, when 38 million, or 14.8%, were classified as poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual income and poverty estimates, bureau officials also said that 
the number of Americans without health care rose 1.1 million last year. At a 
time when health care reform legislation dominated the political agenda, but 
failed to produce a consensus, the bureau said 39.7 million Americans, or 15.3% 
of the population, were without health insurance sometime during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 California was one of three states in which the poverty rate had a 
"statistically significant change," rising nearly 11%. In 1993, 18.2% of 
Californians lived below the poverty line, compared to 16.4% in 1992, officials 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Daniel H. Weinberg, chief of the Census Bureau's Housing and Household 
Economic Statistics Division, seemed baffled as he tried to explain why two 
years after the government announced the end of the recession, the resulting 
recovery is not progressing according to the traditional economic pattern. 
Normally, the poverty rate spikes the year after a recession ends and begins to 
decline in the second year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This recession ended in 1991," Weinberg said. "One could expect a higher 
poverty rate in 1992. This (1993 rate) is unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-class households -- 60% of the population -- commanded 48.2% of the 
nation's income in 1993, down 3% since 1988. Since 1968, the middle class has 
lost 9% of its share of income to the wealthiest Americans. The wealthiest 20% 
of Americans, meanwhile, increased their share of the nation's household income 
to 48.2%, up 4% since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the human toll behind the statistics, political analysts noted 
that the economic uncertainty reflected in the findings may have a powerful 
impact at the polls in November.  
</P>
<P>
 In a mid-term election that is being seen as a referendum on the 
Administration's economic policies, those numbers -- combined with a 
pessimistic assessment of their economic well-being by many Americans -- have 
created a frustrating crisis for Democratic politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a recent study by the Times Mirror Center for The People & The 
Press found that "the Clinton Administration and the economic recovery have 
failed to stem the tide of political cynicism. The discontent with Washington 
that gained momentum in the late 1980s is even greater now than it was in 1992" 
when Clinton was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers are what lies behind the problems the Democratic Party is 
having with younger people and particularly with younger and less-educated 
blue-collar men," said Guy Molyneux, a senior analyst with Peter Hart Research, 
which polls largely for Democrats. "In particular, they are the ones who have 
lost the most ground in the last decade or more and that would also be true 
here. There's a lot of anger out there at government and these economic 
realities are underneath a lot of races that we're seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 Demographers said that the trends revealed in the Census Bureau's latest 
findings continue a longstanding trend that has seen a steady growth in 
disparities between rich and poor. That trend, they added, is being driven on 
one end by a steady increase in single-parent families, who tend to fall below 
the poverty line, and at the other end by two-career families in which 
college-educated women's earnings are bumping family incomes into higher 
brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 One expert on poverty issues noted that similar dismal figures helped undo 
President George Bush in 1992, in spite of strong signs that the economy was 
improving  
</P>
<P>
 "A very sizable majority was not experiencing this recovery in larger 
take-home pay," said Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution. "They saw 
their earnings continuing to shrink and they interpreted that, rightly, as part 
of a very long-term trend that has reduced their living standards. Now, it's 
President Clinton's turn to suffer the consequences for this long-term trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Bureau officials cautioned that comparing the new poverty figures with those 
from previous years is tricky because the government made statistical 
adjustments to compensate for changes in the numbers of people undercounted 
during the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 Statisticians also discovered counting discrepancies when the bureau stopped 
tabulating poverty data on paper and began to use computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, officials were mystified by the jump in families living in poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are unexpected changes and we don't have a good explanation for it," 
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In absolute numbers, the new poverty figures represent the highest number of 
poor people in the country since 1962, when 39.6 million -- or nearly 22% of 
the nation's population -- lived in poverty.

MITCHELL'S VERBAL SLIP MAY PRESAGE DOLE PROMOTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 If retiring Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell's Freudian slip is a 
sign, Senate Democrats are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole at a National Press Club luncheon 
Thursday, Mitchell said, "I will say that I think he's done a very good job as 
minority leader, and I expect him to continue to do that good job as majority 
-- minority -- leader for many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans expect substantial gains in next month's elections. They need to 
gain seven Senate seats to become the majority party in that chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, 61, a Maine Democrat who retires at the end of this session after 14 
years in the Senate, spoke at length at Thursday's luncheon about lawmakers on 
the other side of the aisle -- expressing his frustration with an increasing 
number of filibusters and delay tactics on the Senate floor.

FROM 135 MILES IN SPACE, SHUTTLE RADAR FINDS INTENTIONAL OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Space shuttle Endeavour's powerful radar detected an intentional spill of oil 
and algae from 135 miles up Thursday, discerning black streaks that looked like 
an armada off the coast of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 German scientists dumped more than 100 gallons of diesel oil and algae 
products into the sea just before Endeavour soared overhead to see if the radar 
could distinguish between the two substances. 
</P>
<P>
 The early results indicated that it could. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers applauded when they saw the radar images. They thought they could 
discern the two oil slicks from the five patches of algae but wanted to analyze 
the images further to make sure, said Franz-Peter Spaunhorst, a spokesman for 
the German space agency, which helped coordinate the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour's six tiny steering jets had shut down Wednesday because of a failed 
temperature sensor, preventing the radar instruments from being aimed properly 
and forcing some targets to be scrapped. NASA put together a computer program 
to bypass the sensor and restore use of the jets, but not in time for the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
 To save the experiment, astronaut Daniel Bursch took manual control of the 
jets and accurately pointed the radar at the 106 gallons of diesel oil and 26 
gallons of algae byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
 As promised, two oil-recovery ships quickly cleaned up the mess. 
Environmentalists on shore watched on TV monitors to make sure no wildlife was 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the radar can distinguish between oil spills and the sheen naturally 
produced by fish and plankton, the next step would be to put it aboard a 
satellite. Scientists say such a satellite could allow oil spills to be 
detected and cleaned up more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA added an 11th day to the mission to allow for more radar observations. 
Endeavour is now due back Tuesday.

POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION REJECTS FINE THAT STAFF URGED FOR SEN. CALDERON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Fair Political Practices Commission on Thursday rejected a staff 
recommendation to fine state Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) $15,000 for 
using campaign funds for such personal items such as tennis clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief debate, Commissioner Deborah Seiler characterized the proposed 
fine as "too heavy a hit" and said she favored a penalty of $6,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission staff determined that Calderon had improperly dipped into his 
campaign funds to pay for tennis gear, entertainment for his son's birthday 
party and his wife's modeling photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stipulated agreement signed last month, Calderon, who is seeking 
reelection, agreed to pay the $15,000 fine stemming from an investigation by 
the watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a 3-2 vote, the commission turned down the settlement deal and sent the 
dispute back to its staff for more negotiations.

THE SIMPSON CASE / A DAILY UPDATE; TRIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at some of the key events in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Summary: Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito ruled against defense attorneys 
seeking to suppress evidence seized from O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco after it 
was in police custody. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court action: Ito ruled that repeated searches of the car were proper, even 
though police were not specifically authorized by warrants.He also turned back 
the defense's effort to force Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman back to 
the witness stand, finding that Simpson's lawyers missed their chance to 
question Fuhrman when he testified during the preliminary hearing. Simpson's 
lawyers also complained that prosecutors have stalled on conducting DNA testing 
to gain tactical advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the stand: Prosecutors called a number of police witnesses to describe 
the searches of Simpson's car, building their case that the hunt for evidence 
was proper and focused on efforts to find blood, hair and fibers that might 
connect Simpson to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outside the court: Court personnel said Ito had relented on his plan to oust 
the Los Angeles Daily News from the trial because it had published excerpts of 
the juror questionnaire before prospective jurors had finished filling it out. 
Although Ito remained angry about the incident, a spokeswoman for the court 
said he did not have time to battle the newspaper over the issue.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITIONS; OPPONENTS OF PROP. 187 FACE FUNDING 
SHORTFALL; FOES SAY THEY NEED AT LEAST $3 MILLION, HAVE RAISED $820,996. SOME 
WOULD-BE DONORS WILL FOCUS INSTEAD ON FIGHTING MEASURE IN COURT IF IT BECOMES 
LAW.

<P>
 As business and labor pour millions into other initiatives, the campaign to 
defeat anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187 -- probably the most 
controversial on the ballot -- is falling far short of its ambitious 
fund-raising goals, campaign finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than five weeks before voters go to the polls on Nov. 8, the 
anti-Proposition 187 campaign reported raising $820,996 between July and 
September, and showed a campaign debt of $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultants working to beat Proposition 187 say they need $3 million 
to $5 million to mount an effective television and radio campaign against the 
measure aimed at illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "These figures aren't the final story. If they were, that would be bad news," 
said Scott Macdonald, the anti-187 spokesman. "We need a lot more money raised 
to pay for television and radio advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most explosive initiatives ever in California, Proposition 187 would 
require public schools, hospitals and social workers to report people they 
suspect of being illegal immigrants to law enforcement officials for 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would cut state funds that reach illegal immigrants or their 
children, and require schools to expel children who cannot prove they are in 
the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Proposition 187 leads in the polls, the effort backing the 
initiative, heavy on volunteer help, trails in cash raised, receiving $124,000 
in the past three months, and $406,400 for the year. The campaign has a debt of 
$276,800. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Republican Party is the largest monetary supporter of 
Proposition 187, giving a total of $106,000. Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia) has given $43,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Three groups have given six-figure donations to defeat the measure: The 
California Teachers Assn., $321,000; the State Council of Service Employees, 
$139,000, and Univision, a chain of Spanish language television stations, 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes such as the California Medical Assn., traditionally among the largest 
campaign donors in the state, are giving little cash to fight it. The reason, 
said Steven Thompson, chief lobbyist for the medical association, is that 
Proposition 187 has a substantial lead in polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we'd be involved in substantial costs litigating the measure after 
the election," Thompson said, noting that opponents hope to have the measure 
declared invalid by the courts, if it passes at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance reports filed Wednesday and Thursday for other initiatives show 
millions are being spent to kill an initiative to create a government-run 
health care system, and to promote a tobacco-sponsored initiative to repeal 
existing smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports for other measures show: 
</P>
<P>
 * Supporters of Proposition 184, the "three strikes" sentencing law, raised 
$141,000 in the past three months, boosting the total beyond $1 million since 
the campaign began. Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), seeking to unseat 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, has given $350,000 to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of "three strikes" raised $13,855.  
</P>
<P>
 * Supporters of Proposition 185, which would add a 4-cent gasoline tax to fund 
rail projects, raised $102,633, pushing the total to $1.102 million. Southern 
Pacific is the largest donor, at $362,000, plus a loan of $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents' report was not available at the secretary of state's office 
Thursday -- though the deadline for filing was Wednesday. Past reports show 
Arco, Chevron, and Union Oil gave a combined $90,500 to defeat it earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supporters of Proposition 186, to provide lifelong health care to 
Californians, raised $1 million between July and September, for a total of $1.9 
million since last year. The campaign has a debt of $15,000. The California 
Teachers Assn. gave $301,000 to the Proposition 186 campaign. Other labor 
unions and senior citizens groups also gave heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents raised $5 million between July and September, and had $1.3 million 
in cash. Several insurance companies and associations, and hospital 
corporations gave six-figure donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 188, the tobacco industry initiative, received $5.3 million 
between July and September. Largely funded by Philip Morris, the nation's 
largest cigarette maker, the campaign effort has $1.14 million in cash, and no 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of measure raised $208,000 in the past three months, for a total of 
$256,000. The American Cancer Society, the American Lung Assn., and the 
American Heart Assn. have given a combined $111,000.

NONPARTISAN ELECTION DEBATE PANEL URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With prospects of gubernatorial debates before the Nov. 8 election dimming, 
the leader of the state Senate on Thursday proposed creating a nonpartisan 
commission that would sponsor such debates.  
</P>
<P>
 "The public wants to see and hear their candidates," said state Senate 
President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer. "This commission will give us an official 
mechanism to encourage debates and make sure voters have the opportunity to see 
their candidates discuss the issues and not just hide behind 30-second paid 
commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hayward Democrat said the proposal is rooted in the apparent inability of 
his fellow Democrat, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, and Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson to agree to terms of a joint appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer's plan is modeled after the bipartisan Commission on Presidential 
Debates, set up by the Democratic and Republican parties, and designed to make 
debates a permanent part of the election process. Lockyer hopes to give the 
state commission added power by requiring an asterisk or notation next to 
candidates' names in election materials to indicate whether they agreed to 
participate in a commission-sponsored event. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said he would formally introduce next year his constitutional 
amendment, requiring voters' approval, to create a seven-member debate panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership would include representatives of the print and electronic media, 
higher education, a national organization such as the League of Women Voters 
with experience sponsoring political debates, and a consumer group that 
monitors elections, such as Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 H.D. Palmer, a Wilson campaign aide, said the governor shares Lockyer's sense 
of frustration "because we have been prepared to hold a statewide televised 
debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Glazer, a senior adviser to Brown, hailed the concept as an "outstanding 
idea" but quickly added it is "too bad it is not in effect today in order to 
force Pete Wilson to debate his failed record as governor these past four 
years."

 The Dallas Mavericks gave Roy Tarpley yet another chance Thursday night, 
signing the recently reinstated seven-footer to a six-year contract worth about 
$2.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years to the day since his banishment from the NBA for substance 
abuse, Tarpley was thankful for a chance to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an unbelievable feeling. I feel like I was just drafted all over 
again," said Tarpley, 29. "I'm going to be what I should have been before -- a 
professional on and off the court. I'm ready for the challenge. It's most 
definitely going to be a challenge."

 Trauma from an incident involving L.A. police left Al Joyner with 
post-traumatic stress disorder, according to a psychologist who testified on 
the second day of Joyner's civil case against five LAPD officers who conducted 
a traffic stop on the Olympian on May 8, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner's former agent also took the stand, testifying that Joyner's failure to 
make the 1992 U.S. Olympic team -- which he contends was the result of the 
police incident -- might have cost him as much as $1 million in endorsements 
and income. Joyner won the gold medal in the triple jump at the 1984 Olympic 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Terry Hatter Jr. has already ruled that the traffic stop, during which 
officers held Joyner at gunpoint after mistakenly identifying his car, violated 
Joyner's civil rights. The current phase of the trial is to affix monetary 
damages to the officers' conduct. Miscellany

 Trivia time: Between 1964 and 1973, what was the only school besides UCLA that 
won the NCAA basketball championship? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it has: Detroit Lion running back Barry Sanders, a onetime spokesman 
against premarital sex, acknowledged recently he is the father of a 5-month-old 
son. The infant lives in Dallas with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who is not married, said he sees the child about once a week. Sanders 
said he no longer speaks out against premarital sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sanders: "My position on that has evolved." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Keith Olbermann's name was misspelled in Thursday's Morning 
Briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve . . . oh, Steve!Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle said the 
good news for 49er fans was that quarterback Steve Young, who took a few big 
hits, didn't demand to be traded after being yanked in the third quarter of a 
40-8 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ostler: "He couldn't demand to be traded somewhere else, because he 
wasn't sure where he was. Barstow? BYU?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, Loan Dept.?"Peter Gammons in the Boston Globe: "The (baseball) owners are 
trying to find a bank that will give them a $100-million line of credit (where 
is Billie Sol Estes when they need him?)." 
</P>
<P>
 A box of chocolates: Alexander Mogilny, who defected from the Soviet Union in 
1989 to join the Buffalo Sabres, was a guest of Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
in Washington recently. Mogilny said he was nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mogilny: "Now I know how Forrest Gump felt." 
</P>
<P>
 He combs it with a stick: The Kings made an effort to get bigger players in 
the off-season. All anybody has to do is look at Marty McSorley to notice the 
difference, said Coach Barry Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Melrose: "Now a guy like Marty doesn't even stand out on the ice, except 
for his beautiful blond hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe D. and TV: Herb Caen of the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Joe 
DiMaggio watched the final installment of the "Baseball" documentary while 
sitting at the bar of the Olympic Club, sipping soda and munching peanuts.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: THERE'S MORE THAN FOOTBALL ON AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No baseball, no hockey, but sports on television continue on. 
</P>
<P>
 Two important issues, gender equity and violence, will be examined in separate 
one-hour shows this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion to Play: Stories of Women in Sports," will be on ABC Sunday at 3 p.m. 
It is the first women's sports special on network television since ABC showed 
"The Lady Is a Champ" in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN takes a look at the violence in and around sports with an excellent 
special, "Field of Screams," on its weekly "CNN Presents," which will be shown 
Sunday at 6 p.m. and again at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC special was produced by four women, Emile Deutsch, Nancy Stern, Donna 
de Varona and Tiffany Trigg. The host is Julie Moran, the first full-time 
female anchor of "Wide World of Sports." It was co-written by de Varona and 
Peter Kaminsky, and de Varona is the reporter for a segment on Title IX. 
</P>
<P>
 De Varona, the first full-time female sportscaster in network television, was 
a co-host, along with Billie Jean King, of the 1974 special. 
</P>
<P>
 So how far have women come since then? 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no Olympic marathon back then, no women's basketball on television, 
no women's Final Four," de Varona said from her office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been improvement, but not enough in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those areas is Title IX, the segment she deals with in Sunday's 
special. Title IX was enacted by the federal government in 1972 to ensure 
gender equity in college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually every Division I school is in violation of Title IX," de Varona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 De Varona's segment focuses on the case of former Auburn soccer player Susan 
Kiechel, who sued the school in 1993 for not making women's soccer a varsity 
sport. The school settled the case in May for $140,000, with $80,000 going for 
attorney fees and the remaining $60,000 shared among Kiechel and her 17 
teammates on Auburn's women's soccer club. This was the first Title IX case in 
which monetary damages were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those interviewed are tennis' Martina Navratilova and King, auto 
racing's Janet Guthrie, swimming's Janet Evans, gymnastics' Cathy Rigby and 
speedskating's Bonnie Blair. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley Visser, one of the first female sportswriters in the country, conducts 
a segment on myths and attitudes and the 1973 "Battle of the Sexes" between 
King and Bobby Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Potter does a segment on barrier breakers. Gymnast Kathy Johnson looks 
at eating disorders. Charlsie Cantey profiles the first all-female America's 
Cup team. And ESPN's Robin Roberts, the third-leading scorer in women's college 
basketball for Southeastern Louisiana, looks at opportunities for female 
athletes after college. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a special about women, but it is one that both men and woman can 
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The CNN special examines a wide range of violence in sports. CNN's 
award-winning Jim Huber is the reporter, Bob Abbott the producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, Turner Broadcasting's producer at the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, 
Norway, had planned to do a special on European soccer hooligans after the 
Games and tie it to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But soccer hooliganism ended up becoming a very small part of the special. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the in-depth stories, Huber takes a look at the turmoil figure 
skating's Katarina Witt went through for two years because of a stalker. Witt, 
in an interview Huber did at her home in Park City, Utah, goes into great 
detail about how the stalker, Harry Veltman of Westminster, made her life a 
living hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Veltman, 47 at the time, was arrested at his home on Dec. 26, 1992, the day 
before Witt was to perform at the Forum. Veltman had stalked Witt across two 
continents, threatening to break into her home outside Berlin and once invading 
her room in a Berlin hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 German police came on that occasion, and Witt had to translate for them. "They 
would say, 'Ask him if he has a gun,' and so I would say, 'Do you have a gun?' 
It was really bizarre," she tells Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Veltman was sentenced to 37 months of confinement in June, 1993. On Aug. 31, 
however, after serving his time in a psychiatric hospital, Veltman was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highlight of the special is an interview with World Series goat Mitch 
Williams at his ranch in Hico, Tex. Williams talks about the death threats he 
received after last year's Series, in which he gave up the deciding home run to 
Toronto's Joe Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional bodyguard Nelson Mercado, profiled in a recent Times story by 
Chris Dufresne, is featured in one segment, the Monica Seles stabbing is dealt 
with in depth and new Laker Cedric Ceballos talks about the fear he experienced 
when a robber stuck a gun to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an uplifting show, but it's one worth watching.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; JOHNSON QUESTIONABLE DESPITE PRACTICING

 Quarterback Rob Johnson practiced in full pads for the first time this week 
but didn't take as many snaps as his backup, Brad Otton. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson said he won't decide if Johnson will play Saturday at 
Oregon State until giving Johnson "a long look" at this afternoon's practice in 
Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Robinson and his staff have been unhappy so far over play in the 
defensive secondary and erratic efforts by young players, one area where the 
Trojans seem solid is at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Heralded transfer Eric Herrin had his biggest game against Oregon last week, a 
13-tackle performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior linebackers Jeff Kopp (34 tackles) and Brian Williams (28) are the team 
leaders in tackles and newcomer Israel Ifeanyi has shown marked improvement 
since the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson on the Pacific 10: "I think we're seeing the conference has a lot of 
parity. This is the first time we've lost since I've been back when we were 
favored. The margin is small. If you look around the Pac-10, you can look at 
up-and-down performances by everyone but Arizona.

 "A week ago, we were on track and rolling. Then we took a step backward."

 Saturday could mark the long-awaited debut of USC tailback LaVale Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-7, 190-pounder was a hit at USC's 1993 preseason training camp, but 
Woods suffered a knee injury and sat out last season. Then he injured a knee 
during track season last spring and only recently has he seemed fully healed.

 Apparently, the Beavers are big in Japan. Three Oregon State games -- 
including Saturday's against USC -- will be televised in Japan, on the Gaora 
Sports Network. . . . USC guard Kyle Ramsay, the only Oregonian on the Trojan 
roster, grew up on a farm 20 minutes from Oregon State. . . . Senior Oregon 
State cornerback William Ephraim, from Fontana, has knocked down or intercepted 
29 passes, the Oregon State career record. EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; REDSHIRT FRESHMAN THRUST INTO KEY ROLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chad Sauter has come a long way: from getting three plays in garbage time 
against Nebraska to starting at left guard against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much choice. UCLA is just about out of offensive linemen. Sauter 
didn't even know he was starting until three nights before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the Washington game I was so nervous," Sauter said. "I didn't know 
what I was going to do. I don't care if I make a mistake and get yelled at, but 
I do care if I make a mistake and get a quarterback hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 While others socialized and snacked in their Seattle hotel rooms, Sauter spent 
the night before the game with his playbook, trying to make sure that any of 
his Saturday mistakes weren't mental. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a few at first, but as the game went on I just played football," he 
said. "I felt good. I'd forgotten what fun it was to play football." 
</P>
<P>
 Sauter's last football had been for Torrance South High, where he played both 
ways and seldom left the field. His redshirt season at UCLA was difficult 
because his only football was played on the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauter became a starter when James Christensen was injured against Washington 
State. He joins another redshirt freshman, tackle Chad Overhauser, and junior 
guard Mike Rohme as newcomers on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback James Milliner has joined the list of those who will not make the 
trip to Berkeley for Saturday's game against California. Milliner has a 
shoulder ailment, and without him and Greg Ford, who has been out two weeks 
because of a back problem, the Bruins are reduced to one scholarship fullback: 
Daron Washington. Walk-on junior Greg Cass will back up Washington. . . . Other 
starters who will not play Saturday: wide receiver J.J. Stokes (bruised thigh), 
guard Matt Soenksen (knee), guard Christensen (knee), tackle Paul Kennedy 
(knee, out for season) and cornerback Carl Greenwood (ankle, out for season).

KANSAS STATE RIDES MAY'S ARM TO 21-13 VICTORY OVER KANSAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chad May shredded a suspect secondary for 379 yards Thursday 
night, leading No. 19 Kansas State past Kansas, 21-13, and giving the Wildcats 
their first victory in Lawrence, Kan., in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 May befuddled the Jayhawks with post patterns, crossing patterns, screen 
passes, shovel passes and bombs.By halftime, the Wildcats (4-0) had one yard 
rushing, 271 passing and a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh time in his 16-game career that the 6-foot-2, 220-pound May 
had thrown for more than 300 yards. He completed 33 of 44 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, May completed seven of nine passes in a 
69-yard scoring drive, capped by J.J. Smith's eight-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored his second on a one-yard run later in the quarter. The Wildcats 
then took the second-half kickoff and used 16 plays to go 80 yards. May 
completed passes to Kevin Lockett for 10 and 15 yards and gave the ball to Rod 
Schiller for a one-yard scoring dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas (3-2), which was ranked 76th nationally in pass defense, scored twice 
in the fourth quarter to make it mildly interesting.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; WALLACE RELISHES NEW PASS-RUSHING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aaron Wallace was drafted in the second round by the Raiders in 1990 from 
Texas A&M as a pass rush specialist. In his four-year college career as an 
outside linebacker, he had a school-record 42 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rookie, Wallace played mostly as a backup defensive end and impressed 
teams around the league with nine sacks. The next season, however, the Raiders 
made him a starter when they moved him back to outside linebacker in their 4-3 
defensive front. 
</P>
<P>
 That was until this week, when Coach Art Shell named rookie Rob Fredrickson as 
starter and moved Wallace back to defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that I played (outside linebacker) pretty well, but I always felt kind 
of average there," Wallace said Thursday. "But I always felt that I could excel 
as a pass rusher." 
</P>
<P>
 Did the move surprise Wallace? 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was a mutual decision because I've always been on the coaches to 
let me rush the passer again," Wallace said. "With (Fredrickson) here now, I'm 
glad that I will get the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said that he may still play at linebacker against New England on 
Sunday, but he hopes to give the Raiders some needed sacks, considering that 
safety Eddie Anderson is tied for the team lead with two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said that there is "a good possibility" that recently signed fullback 
Jarrod Bunch will be activated for the first time this season for the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell also said that defensive end Willie Broughton, who has been sidelined 
because of an elbow injury, will probably sit out the game despite practicing 
with the team for the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After four games, a major disappointment for the Raiders has been the lack of 
production from wide receiver James Jett, who last season led the AFC as a 
rookie in yards per catch. 
</P>
<P>
 With only five catches for 80 yards and no touchdowns, Jett has almost become 
the team's forgotten man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It concerns me because of the things that he's capable of doing," Shell said. 
"We've tried these things and we've just been out of sync with them. There's 
been some shots that we've taken with James, we just haven't connected. Last 
year we were connecting on those things." LONNIE WHITE

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; SMALL FIELDS ARE ONE BAD FEATURE OF 
FEATURE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The small fields that weaken racing cards on an all-too-regular basis show no 
signs of disappearing, not even for several major stakes in California and New 
York this weekend. Santa Anita and Belmont Park are throwing pre-Breeders' Cup 
parties, and in many cases hardly anybody wants to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage of horses is so dire at Belmont that Saturday's $250,000 Beldame 
Stakes, which was first run when "Gone With the Wind" was a new movie, drew 
only five starters and three betting interests, forcing the track to run the 
race as a betless exhibition. The last time a stake was run without betting in 
New York was in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont is offering five other stakes Saturday, with all six totaling $2.5 
million in purses, yet the $250,000 Frizette, for 2-year-old fillies, is 
another five-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Anita this weekend, three of the Oak Tree Racing Assn.'s most 
prestigious stakes may draw only 13 horses. Five are entered in the $200,000 
Oak Leaf on Saturday, five are expected for Sunday's $200,000 Norfolk and there 
are only three definite starters for the $300,000 Oak Tree Invitational, which 
is also on Sunday's card. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller foal crops, too many racing dates and a proliferation of stakes races 
have made filling races more difficult for racing secretaries everywhere. Two 
California 2-year-olds, On Target and Comstock Queen, are running at Belmont 
this weekend. And instead of running the champion Phone Chatter in the $100,000 
Lady's Secret Handicap at Santa Anita on Monday, trainer Richard Mandella will 
ship his filly to Kentucky for the $300,000 Spinster at Keeneland on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jockey Club, which collects data on horse birth rates, estimates that 
32,200 horses will be foaled in the United States this year. That could be the 
lowest total since 1978 and is 13,000 fewer than the total 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At least nine horses will runn in Saturday's richest race, the $750,000 Jockey 
Club Gold Cup, which will have horse-of-the-year ramifications if trainers 
Wayne Lukas and Nick Zito are reading the Eclipse Awards voters accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a groundswell of opinion that Holy Bull has already clinched the 
national title, even though he is through for the year. But Lukas, who trains 
Tabasco Cat, and Zito, the conditioner of Go For Gin, feel that the voters must 
consider their horses if one of them sweeps the Jockey Club Gold Cup and the 
Breeders' Cup. Go For Gin won this year's Kentucky Derby and Tabasco Cat won 
the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes, the other Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the 3-year-olds is favored in Saturday's 1 1/4-mile race. The 
morning line has the 5-year-old Devil His Due at 8-5, even though he has won 
only three of nine starts this year and is three for 13 lifetime at Belmont. In 
his last two starts, Devil His Due lost by five lengths to Holy Bull in the 
Woodward at Belmont and was a nose short of Colonial Affair at the wire of the 
Whitney Handicap at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat is the second choice at 5-2, followed by Go For Gin and Colonial 
Affair, both at 5-1. Others running are Jacksonport, Pistols And Roses, West By 
West, Kissin Kris and Flag Down, a French runner who will be racing on dirt for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas could have a big day. His 2-year-old filly, Flanders, is a 2-5 favorite 
to win the Frizette, and he is high on Timber Country, who will be thrown in 
against favored Montreal Red and On Target in the $500,000 Champagne, which 
drew 11 horses, the largest stakes field on the Belmont card. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas might have scored a behind-the-scenes victory earlier this week with 
Flanders, who tested positive for a prohibited medication, one sometimes used 
to treat horses with foot problems, after winning the Matron at Belmont on 
Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 New York racing authorities disqualified Flanders and took away her $67,000 
purse, but Lukas sent a split urine sample to an independent laboratory, which 
he says found no trace of the drug. In California, a negative split sample 
means the case is dropped, but it was unclear Thursday whether New York would 
treat the Flanders case the same way. Attempts to reach members of the New York 
State Racing and Wagering Board were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at stake for Lukas is whether he receives a suspension of 45 or 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavenly Prize and Educated Risk give trainer Shug McGaughey a heavily favored 
entry in the Beldame. McGaughey won five of the six races, a national record, 
on Breeders' Cup preview day a year ago, but with only three starters in two 
races, he will have to settle for less on Saturday. His brilliant grass horse, 
Lure, who has won the last two runnings of the Breeders' Cup Mile, will try to 
repeat in the one-mile Kelso Handicap. Lure will carry 128 pounds for the first 
time, spotting six opponents seven to 22 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $500,000 Turf Classic at Belmont, Royal Mountain Inn, who beat Flag 
Down by half a length in the Man o' War last month, is favored over six rivals 
that include Fraise and Alex The Great. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Anita in Saturday's Oak Leaf, Call Now, running around two turns for 
the first time, is favored against four other fillies, including How So Oiseau 
and Serena's Song, who couldn't beat her in the Del Mar Debutante a month ago. 
The other starters are Main Slew and Mama Mucci.

THEATER; MAKING A DRAMATIC NOISE; THEATER COMPANY HAS FOUND ITSELF A NICHE IN 
THE CLASSICAL REALM AND MET WITH CRITICAL ACCLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a whole lot of shaking going on at the Valley's prestigious 3-year-old 
classical theater company, A Noise Within. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, its fall repertory season opened this week with Shakespeare's 
"King Lear," directed by the company's resident director / artistic adviser 
Sabin Epstein. It will be joined Oct. 19 by Richard Brinsley Sheridan's "The 
School for Scandal," directed by Art Manke, and on Nov. 2 by John Steinbeck's 
"Of Mice and Men," under the guidance of Julia Rodriguez Elliott and Geoff 
Elliott. Manke and the Elliotts are A Noise Within's artistic directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Classical repertory is a hard nut to crack. But the success and critical 
approval of the company's first two seasons would indicate that it's doing 
something right, and this winter will be its busiest yet. In January the 
company will revive its acclaimed production of Oscar Wilde's "The Importance 
of Being Earnest," followed in repertory by "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Anton 
Chekhov's "The Three Sisters" and W.S. Gilbert's rarely produced "Engaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't stop there. At the moment the group is operating under Equity's 99-Seat 
Theater Plan, but is working on a scheduled upgrading from this small theater 
system to a mid-sized house, possibly on the first floor of the same former 
church building where it began three years ago with a trial production of 
"Hamlet." That production made the company's name and set it on the road to the 
frenetic repertory existence that consumes its time today. 
</P>
<P>
 And beginning in early 1995, A Noise Within will become a touring company 
under an Equity touring contract, which will allow it to pay its actors what 
the artistic directors call "almost a living wage." Productions of "Earnest" 
and "Dream" will play either singly or in repertory in full-sized theaters from 
San Diego to Santa Barbara, from Palm Springs to Hawaii's Maui Arts and 
Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing to take a breath, the company's four heads try to explain the state of 
their art. 
</P>
<P>
 As for their move to larger quarters, Geoff Elliott says: "Our hope -- and 
we're confident -- is that we will move down to the first floor of this 
building, which will be refurbished into a 350- to 500-seat theater. We're 
about to embark on a feasibility study, along with a marketing and operating 
study. The study will also give us milestones, where we should be at various 
times between now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Rodriguez Elliott further explains: "The phrase 'feasibility study' is 
an odd one. It's really more of a business plan that's going to tell us how we 
get there. From the beginning of this company, the plan has been to really 
become a LORT (League of Resident Theatres) theater. The 99-Seat Plan has been 
great, because it has facilitated what we're doing right now, but people who 
are involved know that this is not where we want to be. It's simply part of the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the process also seems to be the tours. This is not something the 
company sought, because in addition to difficult and time-consuming scheduling 
and budgeting, the tours will occur simultaneously with the continuing 
repertory operation at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't go looking for it, beating down doors," Manke says. "It came to us. 
We were doing a production of 'Tartuffe.' The Norris Theatre (in Palos Verdes) 
had an opening in its season because their scheduled production had canceled on 
them. They came to look at 'Tartuffe,' along with a booking agent. It didn't 
work out, but they asked us to come the following year with 'The School for 
Wives.' The booking agent has since lined up a whole slew of stuff for this 
year. There are several reasons for doing it. One of the most important is that 
it allows us to pay the actors. It also allows us a greater visibility. It 
doubles our audience in a very quick time period, and increases the recognition 
of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 With three shows running at home while the company is touring, it would seem 
that there might not be enough actors. With an explosive laugh, Geoff Elliott 
says, "Enough can't be said for a strong understudy program." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sizable company, Epstein explains, adding: "One of the things about the 
way we view ourselves, is that it's a company of actors who are capable of 
playing any of the roles at any point in time. And sometimes do, at a moment's 
notice. There's never a sense of compromise. An actor who comes in playing a 
servant in one production, will play a lead in another. The work is always 
equally balanced and distributed in the course of the season, among all the 
actors. So even when we're on tour, there's no shortchanging an audience or 
diminishing the quality or integrity of the work on stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Manke tells about actor Neil Vipond, who is playing Lear, who earlier played 
Prospero in "The Tempest" one night and the next played the butler Lane in the 
first act of "The Importance of Being Earnest," a role with about 15 lines. 
"That quality of actor, even in the smallest of roles," Manke exclaims, " and 
he stayed for the rest of the production to take the curtain call, which is a 
testament to the dedication on the part of the actors to completing the 
integrity of the work. That's one of the great joys of repertory." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein believes another joy of repertory casting is that audiences enjoy it. 
"They have come to know the actors through a variety of roles, and quite often 
they're very surprised to see somebody play something completely different from 
what they have come to expect them to do. They never quite know how to peg an 
actor. An audience takes great delight in that." 
</P>
<P>
 It also creates a great deal of loyalty from the audience, Manke says, "a sort 
of sense of ownership about the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Elliott agrees, adding, "It becomes a sort of extended family." 
</P>
<P>
 Family is an operative word when any of the four are talking about A Noise 
Within. It is also a word that helped guide the group in the choices for this 
fall season. Whereas its first season was called "Insatiable Obsessions," and 
the second "Breeding," this trio of classics comes under the umbrella title 
"Relative Encounters." 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing plays they like to find a common thread, a theme. With "A School 
for Scandal," the issues involved with a culture based on appearances, and 
finding one's way within a culture, are as true today as when the play was 
written in 1770. "Of Mice and Men" is about two people choosing to be together, 
creating their own family. "Lear," of course, is about the ultimate in 
dysfunctional families. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Elliott takes the family idea even further, to include A Noise Within's 
actors and its audience's familiarity with the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience and the ensemble really get to know each other," he says. 
"That's something I hope we never lose. In the great scheme of things, it was 
no mistake that this was a church before it became our first space as a 
theater. There's that whole sense of community, and commun -al . Think of that 
and think of the actors being members of a community outreach program. It's 
what it's all about. Theater was originally religion. It was a place you went 
to see how your life was, and how your life could be changed. That's still 
possible. That's what live theater should be. I hope that's where we continue 
to go with it." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "King Lear," "The School for Scandal," "Of Mice and Men," in repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; PAIR FILL OUT FLIMSY 'FRIENDS'; PLAY IS WEAK, BUT ACTORS GIVE 
STRONG, EASY PERFORMANCES AS OLD COLLEGE BUDDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you're willing to believe that a potential American ambassador to the 
United Nations is likely to escape to Vermont for a weekend and check up on an 
old college buddy -- and maybe check out of life as well -- then you'll 
probably accept most of what occurs in Lee Kalcheim's play "Friends" at the 
Little Victory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Rudy Gaines' cast of Drew Pillsbury as Okie, the ambassador 
candidate, and Martin Grey as his pal Mel are the magicians here. They so 
thoroughly put across the sense that taking on these characters was the easiest 
thing they've done all month, you may very well swallow the play whole. 
</P>
<P>
 That's magic for you, but it's still actors' smoke and mirrors in front of 
what is truly flimsy stuff. Kalcheim not only draws a good deal of his dramatic 
weight from the old and worn-out Chekhovian device of bringing a rifle onto the 
stage, but he resolves the play's dilemma with the kind of quick, easy and 
unearned ending endemic to television -- for which Kalcheim also writes (the 
new "Something Wilder"). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mel is a 38-year-old underachiever of pathetic proportions (money for 
his cabin-style living seems to come solely from a weekly cartoon he draws for 
The Village Voice), the dilemma here is Okie's. He seems to be running away 
from his wife, his State Department post -- in short, the perceived success 
that Mel secretly desires. 
</P>
<P>
 With a lesser actor than Pillsbury, Okie would seem to be at worst a spoiled 
complainer, at best a man in an existential fog. Kalcheim inserts a lot of side 
business and tomfoolery to delay the emotional revelations of Okie, and the 
delay creates an anticipation with no real payoff. Pillsbury, though, invests 
every moment with a surface cool that conceals decades of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Grey is directed by Gaines to come on yackety-yacking in the beginning, and it 
sets the wrong tone for this guy. Soon, he calms down and establishes an 
ever-so-gentle comic manner that makes us and Okie at ease. Grey also has the 
character with the most interesting details: Mel has a lost love and a 
lifestyle combining low-tech modesty and a taste for gourmet cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 The details don't end there, extending to the thoroughly realized Vermont 
cabin digs (care of designers Bruce and Julie Curtis), and some 
weather-sensitive lighting by Brian Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends" is substantially a one-act fattened out to two, but oddly the 
fattening is all actor behavior and ends up being more honest than the 
substance of the play. Then again, "Friends" may have been a vehicle for 
Pillsbury and Grey all along; it's hard to see other actors carrying so much of 
the load so well. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Friends."

BORROWING FOR 'BLUE'; THE UNLIKELY CREATOR OF A PLAY ABOUT A JEWISH FAMILY 
SURVIVING A WEDDING IS A GENTILE FROM THE DEEP SOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes frequently about 
theater for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Yeah, I know, I know, 'Write what you know,' " playwright Claudette Powell 
says back to a visitor when asked a basic question: How can a Gentile from 
Georgia write a comedy about a Jewish family? 
</P>
<P>
 The quick answer is "imagine it," but Powell isn't so glib. Although trained 
in the hard knocks of improv at New York University and in a year's stint with 
the Groundlings' Sunday company, Powell doesn't want to come up with an 
off-the-cuff response. Non-Jews depicting Jews comically, to be sure, isn't 
something to be taken lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell hopes, though, that her new play, "Something Blue," at the Whitefire 
Theatre, will be taken in the spirit in which it was created: an affectionate 
look at how a family responds not only to a wedding but also to a rebellious 
love affair going on at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking big, Powell, now 28, originally wrote "Something Blue" as a film with 
three acts, the centerpiece being the temple wedding and the party. She had 
been inspired by a college friend's 1989 wedding in New Jersey that was, she 
says, "like a comedy. It was laid out for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Johanna here," says Powell, pointing to co-star and fellow NYU alum 
Johanna Steinberg "suggested that I do it as a play." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time in 1992, Steinberg, now 26, had been developing theater projects, 
"and what Claudette had imagined seemed to easily fit on stage. I was also her 
Jewish consultant." 
</P>
<P>
 Squeezing a film script into a play is the reverse of the usual process, and 
Powell quickly found that she had to let things go -- like the last two acts of 
her original story. "It's now located," Powell says in a deep-South drawl, "at 
the heart of a Jewish home -- the kitchen. I've also found that setting the 
action before the wedding makes it less about the wedding and more about the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's fictional clan is the Katzens, whose daughter Joanne (Steinberg) is 
about to marry a nice Jewish man, while her sister Sandy (Tatiana Turan) is in 
love with an African American Buddhist. Both groom and lover remain offstage as 
three generations of Katzens battle over love, propriety -- maybe even the 
brisket. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jill Schwartz proudly notes that actor Dorothy Sinclair, who plays 
the Katzen grandmother, cooks her own brisket for each performance, and Lydia 
Weiss (as the mother) prepares the chicken. This is one well-stocked stage 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Claudette really creates a roller coaster of emotions," says Schwartz, 29, 
"so you're catching yourself laughing just moments after you've cried." Powell 
blushes slightly from the compliment, but the highest praise may have come from 
the play's first audience at a workshop run at Beverly Hills' Roxbury Park. 
"They were shocked," Steinberg says, "that Claudette wasn't Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 It's really not such a leap for Georgia-born, Baptist-reared Powell -- not 
after she went to NYU and encountered "a lot of Jewish kids who immediately 
were taken aback by my Southern accent. . . . I had to reassure them that I 
wasn't anti-Semitic. I also have Native American blood on my dad's side, so I 
understand persecution." 
</P>
<P>
 At NYU, Powell also began to understand improv, especially when the Yale-based 
Purple Crayon improv group dropped by to see "our rag-tag improv show done in 
front of a bunch of drunk college students. They told us, 'You guys need some 
help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn to the Groundlings and its tradition as a lab for comedy writing, Powell 
says she learned the art of streamlining: "They taught me to drive the story 
forward and trim the fat. Which is why my play is short." 
</P>
<P>
 The only question for the "Something Blue" company now is whether the fresh 
brisket and chicken will keep coming as the show continues its open run. "That 
kind of problem," Schwartz says, "I don't mind." Where and When

GOING BACK TO BASICS; LITA ALBUQUERQUE USES NATURAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS ROCKS, 
COPPER AND COAL TO EXPLORE TIME, SPACE AND HUMAN EXISTENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Rocks speak to Los Angeles artist Lita Albuquerque. They have since she was a 
girl growing up in Tunisia, in the area that was the ancient city-state of 
Carthage. 
</P>
<P>
 They speak of time and place, of the Earth's essence and of our own existence 
because, after all, we humans are made up of elements not so unlike those of a 
rock or a piece of coal. In "Remembrance," her series of paintings and 
sculpture, they bring the natural world, which is so much a part of her being, 
and her personal story into the center of her art. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this particular series, I am using the rock as a metaphor for the planet 
Earth, and thinking of it as a fragment floating through space," said 
Albuquerque before the opening last Sunday of her solo show, "Remembrance: 
paintings and sculpture by Lita Albuquerque," at the University of Judaism's 
Platt Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work does come from my observance of nature, from looking at the Earth 
from a great perspective of time and space. I was especially impacted by my 
years in Tunisia, the cross-cultural influences and the geography of the place, 
the colors." 
</P>
<P>
 The intense blue hues of her work, generated from powdered pigment, are the 
colors of her childhood home's sea and sky. The gold from gold leaf is of its 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tunisia, "the nighttime sky was not black, but blue," she said. "What I'm 
interested in is the effect of the sea, sun and sky on our physiology, the 
physiological need and response to them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Remembrance" is the first exhibit to open in the gallery since the Jan. 17 
earthquake closed the space. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I came into Lita's studio, I was struck by the presence of the 
work," said Judith Samuel, the gallery coordinator. "It has a universal 
context, of course, but within a Judaic context, the rock is another symbol for 
God. The aftermath of the earthquake brought a new demeanor to the space, a 
rebirth of the gallery. It took nine months." 
</P>
<P>
 Inherent in the 15 works on view is the "idea of transformation, the idea that 
we can all transform and re-create ourselves," said Victor Raphael, a member of 
the University of Judaism's Fine Arts Council and the exhibit curator. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the earliest works in the "Remembrance" series, which Albuquerque 
began in 1988, presents a square, painted panel with a metal -- often copper 
leaf -- disk at its center. A rock emanates from the disk's center. 
</P>
<P>
 Copper, which is "very Islamic," Albuquerque said, is also "conductive. I talk 
about the reflectivity of the planet. What I'm interested in is bringing up the 
natural world on an equal par to logic. We could describe all of these works in 
scientific terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Later works include vibrant auras around the disk and a piece of coal rather 
than rock. Albuquerque uses coal for "what it represents in terms of time and 
information, and that it comes from the core of the Earth," she said. "I'm 
putting all these elements out as questions about 'What is matter?' These 
objects are very much objects of perception -- phenomenological. One perceives 
them through the senses." 
</P>
<P>
 Albuquerque said: "I'm really talking about the origin, both organic and 
inorganic. We are matter, but we truly exist beyond matter. You can't measure 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent untitled work depicts the horizon of the Earth, painted in black, 
against deep blue space. Beneath the painting lies a glass box filled with 
gold-leaf fragments. Here she questions "what was the alchemical work?" she 
said. What was the process that transformed base metals into gold? But she 
explained that she seeks not so much a literal answer, but a more poetic one. 
</P>
<P>
 To shed some light on her process, Albuquerque has included an "alchemical 
workshop" in the center of the gallery. On display are artist's pages -- her 
writings about the ideas behind the pieces -- as well as journal writings that 
began Jan. 17, after the earthquake. Elements have been set on a scale, 
calibrated, measured. Gold and coal symbolize the equilibrium of light and 
dark. Numbers on paper suggest another kind of information in the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something representative of my studio at home, the inner works 
of how I get from here to there," she said. Through writing, meditation and 
artistic processing of elements, "I project myself to all known reaches of the 
outer universe." 
</P>
<P>
 Albuquerque said she "would love to be an astronaut, to go on one of those 
shuttles." However, she's able to travel through time, space and matter without 
the aid of a supersonic vehicle. Where and When

MUSIC; BLEND OF BLUES AND BE-BOP; TENOR SAXOPHONIST WILBUR BROWN CREATED HIS 
COLORFUL, EMOTIONAL STYLE FROM YEARS OF PLAYING WITH JAZZ LEGENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 His body erect yet relaxed, his tenor saxophone in front of him, Wilbur Brown 
stands in the patio of the Cat and Fiddle Pub and Restaurant in Hollywood, 
playing jazz that has an effervescent, appealing bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Brief, bluesy phrases, the kind that send a shiver right down to your heels, 
are followed by rocketing lines that carom around the verdant patio. This 
musical mixture almost always draws vigorous applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a blues guy, and I'm a be-bop guy," Brown said after a recent Sunday 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 He performs with pianist Frank Strazzeri's quartet Saturday at Chadney's. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is a superb yet unheralded musician who began his professional career at 
15 with blues and R&B hit-makers Joe Liggens and Roy Milton. A humble, 
soft-spoken sort who would never say he's in the same league as the giants of 
jazz -- some would argue he is -- Brown says the blues permeated the music of 
those legends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen to Milt Jackson," he says, referring to the acclaimed vibist with the 
Modern Jazz Quartet, "and you hear the blues. That's what makes him attractive. 
Miles (Davis), when he played 'My Funny Valentine,' played the blues." 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist, who has worked with Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, Hank 
Crawford, Lloyd Price and Kenny Dorham, says everybody can understand the 
blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blues is a nice feeling," he says. "It's a folk music that people take to. 
They can feel it. Even people who don't like be-bop or the blues are affected 
by it." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Los Angeles, Brown said he developed his colorful, emotional style 
from necessity as much as inspiration. "When I was a kid, you really didn't 
need to know anything but blues changes, because there were no gigs but blues 
gigs," he says. At a Westside home and wearing jeans, sneakers, and a pale blue 
polo shirt, he adds, "And I took any gig I could get." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown began to play saxophone when he was 8 or 9, and when he was in the 10th 
grade, be-bop caught his ear. He set out to master it. "I was an admirer of 
Charlie Parker," he says, referring to one of the fathers -- along with 
trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie -- of the complex, compelling art form of be-bop. 
"And as an admirer, I learned to play fast because he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is mostly self-taught -- not only as a saxophonist, but as an arranger 
and orchestrator. But he did take lessons from Lloyd Reese, a trombonist who 
also taught such L.A. legends as Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus and Buddy 
Collette. Brown as much as admits that Reese's direction and firm hand led him 
to his bountiful career in music. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me how to learn, how to teach myself. He gave me exercises, and if 
I didn't practice them, he'd say, 'Well, maybe you don't want to be a musician 
after all. Take a couple of weeks off and think it over,' " Brown recalls with 
a shudder. "That was like telling me he was going to take my left leg off at 
the ankle, something tantamount to that." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, after establishing himself as a jazzman in his hometown, Brown moved 
to New York, and stayed for 10 happy years. "If you want to find out about 
yourself, that's the place to do it," he says. He played with many of the best, 
and one cherished memory is of a weeklong engagement with pianist Red Garland, 
who was a central figure in Miles Davis' quintet of the mid '50s. "I couldn't 
play a wrong note," Brown says with an infectious smile. "No matter what I did, 
he made sense of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles, Brown played around town with many artists, including 
Strazzeri. "If he were a dancer, you'd say he had style and grace," Brown says 
of the pianist. "We just have fun together." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past eight years, Brown has co-led a quintet at the Cat and Fiddle 
with altoist Pat Britt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilbur is the ideal saxophonist for any blues or jazz job," Britt says. "He 
can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says a life in music has given him "happiness, I guess, and great peace 
of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very lucky to have played with great musicians whom I admired. And 
they haven't been mean to me, you know," he says, smiling. Where and When 
</P>

CLUB SCENE; COZY CAFE WITH EUROPEAN FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake affected many businesses in the Valley and some have 
yet to recover. Royal Grounds was shaken but refused to give up. Two days after 
opening, the Toluca Lake coffeehouse was devastated by the quake. Despite the 
damage, the owners stayed open and pitched in to help others. "We didn't know 
if it was an omen or some sign that we should carry on," said co-owner Ian 
Tyson. "It definitely took the wind out of our sails." 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: A quaint little coffee shop that pleases the eye as well as the 
palate. It is small but airy, with European styling, a mixture of Italian and 
Colonial, according to Tyson, transplanted from Britain, who designed the shop. 
The walls are beige, decorated with elaborate draperies and what Tyson called 
"100-year-old tapestries." To the rear is Portrait of A Bookstore, which 
although under separate ownership, complements the coffeehouse. The bookstore 
was thriving nearby but was forced to close after the quake. The shop relocated 
to its present site after Tyson and his wife, Wilma, offered the room in back. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Most in the audience were there to see the singer last Friday 
night. The ages varied greatly, from early 20s to sixtysomething, and the dress 
was casual. A large portion of the audience said it was the first time they had 
been to Royal Grounds, but all said they would be back. "It has a homey 
feeling," said 24-year-old Hilma Shahinian, of Glendale. "It's great for 
someone who likes books and likes coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Gina Livingston, a singer-songwriter who had just returned from 
living and touring in Germany, performed sets of original jazz, blues and funk 
material, accompanied by Gigi Gostas on bass. Livingston explained that her 
bluesy music makes her more readily accepted in America than in Europe. "They 
can relate faster," she said. "This is American music." 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Clean -- which is what Tyson had in mind in designing his 
coffeehouse. "I like the flavor better than the bric-a-brac type, with the old 
sofa and chairs," he said. "I don't like the uncleanliness of them. I'm always 
afraid I'm sitting on a muffin." Sonia Cardoso, 26, of Glendale said, "It's 
cozy, laid back and soothing. You can come the way you are and just be you." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: Unlike other coffeehouses or area nightspots, Royal Grounds closes 
early. This is not a place for night owls. After a nice evening of good 
conversation, nice atmosphere and fine music, the doors shut at 11 p.m. Well, 
it can't have everything.  
</P>
<P>
 THE READ: Portrait of A Bookstore packs a lot in a little space. Owners Julie 
and Frank Von Zerneck stock new releases, bestsellers and soon-to-be 
bestsellers, reference books, children's books, collectibles, English antiques 
and more. Whew! The best of the bunch are leather-bound journals and address 
books. In vibrant reds, purples and blues, these volumes are not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Grounds, 10144 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake. Hours: live music, 8 to 11 
p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; comedy, 8 to 11 p.m. Thursdays. (818) 505-0930.

 There's a bar here where last call is usually before 3 in the afternoon, even 
on Fridays. It's not even open weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why residents of the upscale neighborhoods surrounding the joint 
barely know it exists -- although it is the only bar with a 91330 ZIP. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pub, as it is called, is hidden inside the Cal State Northridge campus. 
Students are its main clientele, but manager Kevin Davenport says even the lure 
of beer -- an assortment at that -- is not enough to keep most of the over-21 
crowd from fleeing school right after class. 
</P>
<P>
 Some days, the place looks as deserted as the chem lab over vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who aren't students are intimidated about coming to campus," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 They shouldn't be. Besides its regular art, theater and music offerings, the 
school is not a bad place to eat, drink, do a little shopping, have some fun, 
even raise some Cain. There are sporting events, art exhibits and, if you know 
where to look, free movies twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal State Northridge has a well-deserved reputation for being a 
no-nonsense commuter school -- with most students juggling classes and jobs -- 
it offers a wide range of diversions for those who no longer worry about 
trading shifts at Burger Village during finals week. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus and even classes are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot going on behind these walls," says Peter Holmes, coordinator of 
the school's institutional and guest relations. "The public sometimes has a 
misconception about what really goes on here. And I think they would be amazed 
at the facilities. . . . These are your tax dollars at work." 
</P>
<P>
 For those seeking a formal introduction, Holmes and 27 student volunteers, 
acting as campus docents, conduct free weekday tours for groups or individuals, 
generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 visitors take the tour each year, Holmes says. They are mostly 
prospective students and staff, but anyone who calls (818) 885-2879 can arrange 
a tour. For the hearing-impaired, signers are available. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley residents worried about ridicule -- or worse -- from 
roving gangs of kids with pierced body parts and Frankenstein shoes ought to 
know that about a third of CSUN students are older than 30. In fact, ticket 
sales for school events on average are split roughly between 40% students and 
60% everybody else. Athletic events have a 50-50 split, campus officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers reluctant about going back to school, if only to ride their bikes or 
skateboards through the nicely landscaped grounds and cement pathways, should 
consider that the campus spends about $100 million a year in public money. 
Millions more will be spent to rebuild portions of the campus damaged by the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The more adventurous visitor can strike out without a guide, simply by 
plunking down $1.75 for a parking sticker at either the Prairie Street or 
Lindley Avenue entrances. Parking attendants sell the passes, which provide an 
opportunity to hunt for a parking space, and provide maps of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Street parking can be impossible. But for real-life drama, the payoff is 
watching the fleet of tow trucks haul cars off Nordhoff Street during morning 
and afternoon commute hours. Show times vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Once parked, pick up a campus shuttle bus that runs through the campus 
mornings and afternoons during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to kill a day hanging out at CSUN's Student Union. Students do it 
all the time. Join them dropping quarters into pinball and video games at The 
Game Room. It's open six days a week, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through 
Thursday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday and noon to 4 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Billiard tables there rent for $2.50 an hour for two players and $3 an hour 
for up to four players. Ping-Pong tables are $2 an hour, plus a 25-cent ball 
deposit. House rules require that patrons be 13 or older to play video games, 
18 or older to shoot pool. Any age for Ping-Pong, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door is the Spokeworks, the bike and wheelchair repair shop. It's open 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the breezeway is counseling services, which later this month will 
include The Relaxation Room. Inside will be a recliner with a built-in 
massager, a TV and videocassette player with specially designed videotapes on 
relaxation techniques and relationship problems. It is supposed to be just for 
students and staff, but it's worth asking for a tryout. They probably won't ask 
for student ID. 
</P>
<P>
 If stressed -- and turned away from the Relaxation Room -- there is always The 
Pub, which is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer-drinking there can start as early as 10 a.m. Monday through Friday, 
featuring 12-ounce draft beers for $1.49, 12-ounce bottles for $2.17 and 
22-ounce bottles for $3.25. The bar is open until 3 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and 
Friday. Thanks to its big-screen TV, the bar gets busier Mondays during Monday 
Night Football, and is open until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursdays, another happening night, is Jazz Night, where music and beer are 
served until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A weekly rock music night is being planned. The bartender's name is Johnny, 
and food also is served. For information, call (818) 885-3616.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pub has an outside balcony, with tables and chairs overlooking the Student 
Union Pool. The pool is open to the public from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Friday and noon to 4 p.m. Saturday. It costs $2.25 for adults, 50 cents 
for kids 17 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Real fitness buffs should consider joining CSUN Fitness Center, operated by 
the Kinesiology Department. For $70 a semester, members can use the school's 
weight room from 5 to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and join aerobics 
classes. Membership includes use of the P.E. Department pool from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Fridays. For Fitness Center membership, call (818) 885-3200. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, anyone can jog or walk through the campus, which is about two miles 
at its widest point, between Devonshire and Nordhoff streets. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're spending the day on campus because of a job loss or corporate 
downsizing -- or just undecided about what to do for work -- counseling 
services also offers a career evaluation. For $295, career counselors will 
match an individual's skills and interests with the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Or stop by the personnel office, located in one of the new temporary 
buildings, Administration Park 702. It is open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday 
through Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 For a diversion from everyday matters, the CSUN Art Gallery has an exhibit of 
Greek artifacts called the "Cypriote Antiquities in Southern California." 
Beginning Oct. 17 is "The Connective Thread: Textiles of Thailand and Laos," 
which is more interesting than it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Allen-Weiss, curator of the exhibit, says, "Life, death and politics 
provide the context of traditional textiles worn in Asia. A person's status, 
religious or clan affiliation or economic wealth were literally worn on the 
sleeve or other parts of clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Entrance is free to the gallery, open noon to 4 p.m. Monday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Tuesday through Friday. It is in temporary quarters at Art Annex 116, 18111 
Nordhoff St. Coming Dec. 4 is "The World of Puppets," featuring a display of 
puppets and live performances by puppeteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Music performances this fall range from the CSUN jazz band to the CSUN 
symphony to the campus wind ensemble's performance of "The Music for the 
Coronation, Marriage and Funeral of Napoleon" on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Four performances remain in the school's 1994-95 American Guitar Society 
Concert Series, which are $12 each. These are unplugged, classically oriented 
music events. 
</P>
<P>
 And at noon every Wednesday, bands perform in the Student Union. In the past 
they have included Red Hot Chili Peppers, Digable Planets, Mary's Danish, 
Leaving Trains and Bone Thugs N Harmony. Coming are The Rugburns on Oct. 12, 
and on Nov. 2, John Easedale of Dramarama.  
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has temporarily knocked out the school's largest theater, the 
400-seat Campus Theater, so music performances are being held in the Student 
Union, the Little Theater, as well as a pretty hip off-campus site, the nearby 
privately owned Mission Theater, which looks like a Spanish rancho. The annual 
May Music Festival will be May 5 to 7 and 12 to 14. For other music events, 
times and prices, call (818) 885-3180. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theater Department is staging several productions this fall, including a 
Mozart opera, "Cosi Fan Tutte," in the Little Theater, as well as "Microwave 
Drama: Theater in Five Minutes" -- short, original plays -- to be presented at 
The Pub later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater tickets usually range from $5 to $11. Call (818) 885-3091. 
</P>
<P>
 All tickets, for entertainment or sports, are sold through the CSUN ticket 
office in the Student Union. It's open 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through 
Friday and also sells discount movie theater tickets for $4.50 ($5 for Cineplex 
Odeon), as well as discount admissions to Magic Mountain, Sea World and 
Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales are strictly cash, and student ID's are not required. The ticket office 
phone number is (818) 885-2488. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's Oviatt Library is, by far, the largest library in the Valley, with more 
than 600,000 volumes. It has dumped the card catalogue -- the cards themselves 
are being used for scratch pads -- in favor of a computerized system. The 
instructions are fairly easy, and there is usually a student willing to explain 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending privileges for non-students can be purchased for a $40 annual 
membership in the Friends of the Library. Or patrons can read there for 
nothing. Unlike the billiard tables, there is almost never a line. 
</P>
<P>
 If you grow tired of the cloistered life, there is always the gridiron. 
Tickets to CSUN home football games cost $7.50. Homecoming is Oct. 22, against 
San Luis Obispo. The game starts at 7 p.m., and an on-campus carnival will 
precede it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fall sports -- men's soccer, and women's volleyball -- are $5 a ticket. 
Season tickets for basketball season -- which kicks off Oct. 15 with a midnight 
practice season and party at the gym -- cost $50 for 11 homes games. This 
season, home games will include University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UC Berkeley 
and University of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 The sports office number is (818) 885-3215. 
</P>
<P>
 You also can visit the campus without leaving home. CSUN's radio station, KCSN 
(88.5 FM), features classical music Monday through Friday. Weekends are an 
eclectic format of bluegrass, contemporary jazz and radio dramas. For a 
schedule, call (818) 885-3089. 
</P>
<P>
 Movies are Tuesday nights in the Student Union Theater for $3. In October, the 
lineup includes "This Is Spinal Tap" and "Clockwork Orange." Even better are 
the free, mildly current movies shown Thursdays and Sundays at the Satellite 
Student Union. Under an arrangement with local theaters, the school is 
prohibited from advertising titles, but call (818) 885-2491 to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN Women's Center has its own lending library of mostly hard-to-find 
volumes about and by women. It's in a 50-year-old converted house at 9520 
Etiwanda St. The center puts on lectures and exhibits, including on Oct. 17, 
"The Clothesline Project" -- a display of T-shirts with messages from abused 
women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if spending time on campus is not enough, go ahead and try a class or 
two. Under the CSUN Open University program, anyone can take a class for credit 
-- without formally enrolling -- by paying a $135 per unit fee, if there is 
room. The catch: You must sign up by the fourth week of class. It's too late 
for this semester but for next, call (818) 885-2644.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FROM CLASSICAL TO WHIMSICAL; PETER MARTIN'S SHOWROOM 
OFFERS WROUGHT-IRON SAMPLES AT NEARLY WHOLESALE PRICES. HE TAKES CUSTOM ORDERS 
AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever the consumer can deal directly with the maker of a product, a bargain 
often results. Such is the case with Peter Martin, an artisan whose designs in 
wrought-iron furniture and accessories are sold by retailers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples and custom pieces are sold at close to wholesale prices at Martin's 
studio and showroom in North Hollywood. Martin Iron Designs is a full line of 
wrought-iron pieces, ranging from the classical to the whimsical. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples of Martin's designs are on the showroom floor, a pebbled semi-outdoor 
area (wear flats). One of the most unusual pieces is a rectangular (or square, 
depending on your specifications) coffee table in his Branding Iron design. A 
three-inch band of iron is worked into brands of famous Western ranches, 
including Theodore Roosevelt's, and as many as a dozen brands can be worked 
around a table. If you have your own brand (or why not make one up?), it can be 
added to the table's design. This is $385 without the glass top; it would 
probably retail for at least $700. End tables that retail for about $500 run 
$285. 
</P>
<P>
 A catalogue of Martin's creations is available, and if you still don't see 
what you're looking for, Martin will work with you on a custom piece. 
</P>
<P>
 For custom work, bring in your measurements, sketch or photograph and plan on 
a four- to six-week turnaround to translate from one dimension to three 
dimensions. Many of these designs are exclusive, so you won't see them in other 
catalogues or stores. Fifteen finishes are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandeliers can be made in any size or style. A simple design would be around 
$300, although Martin prefers creating more detailed ones. An ornate lighting 
fixture could cost up to $1,000, but keep in mind that at an upscale home 
furnishings store or through a decorator you would pay 40% to 50% more. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has a fondness for chairs. "The back of a chair is like an artist's 
palette," he says. His cat chair reflects this penchant: The body and head of a 
cat form the back, the forepaws are the arms and a tail reaches down and twines 
around a leg. Expect to pay about $650 retail for this, but at the factory it's 
$325. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin practices the Old World art of hand-forged wrought iron, which means 
the metal is heated to red hot and formed into designs with an anvil and hammer 
while it is malleable. Many wrought-iron pieces in stores are hollow pieces of 
metal welded together. All the designs here are hand-forged by Martin on the 
premises, heralded on the outside corner by a huge metal sculpture of a 
dragon-like creature.

MAGIC OF THE MUSTANG; ABOUT 500 OF THE FORD SPORTS CARS WILL BE ON DISPLAY 
SUNDAY IN VALENCIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beatlemania rocked the United States in 1964. So did Mustang mania. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the unveiling that year of Ford's sporty new model at the New York 
World's Fair made automobile lovers twist and shout. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chicago showroom overwhelmed by would-be buyers was forced to summon police. 
In Garland, Tex., the winner among 15 customers who bid on the same Mustang 
insisted on spending the night in the car until he knew that his check had 
cleared. One restaurant owner advertised that his hot cakes were selling like 
Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Proof of the car's enduring popularity will be on display with about 500 
vintage Mustangs on Sunday at Six Flags Magic Mountain. "Mustang Magic," as the 
show is billed, is sponsored by the Pacific Mustang Club, one of two San 
Fernando Valley-based groups whose members share a passion for the Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
 Car owners from as far away as Bellevue, Wash., are expected to motor to the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 But, clearly, the star of this show is a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved Mustangs," said Terry Pottratz, vice president of the 
Pacific Mustang Club and the show's organizer. "The very first car I ever owned 
was a Mustang. Everyone has a theory about Mustangs and why they're drawn to 
them. For me, I think it's just that style and character that no other car 
could have." 
</P>
<P>
 Love your Mustang? Join the club. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 450 Mustang clubs in 16 countries. In the United 
States, there are 301 Mustang clubs and membership exceeds 100,000, the largest 
organized following of any car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Mustang Club and the Mustang Owners Club of California have a 
combined membership of about 800. Both meet monthly so that owners can share 
information and plan shows in which cars are judged on authenticity of 
restoration or their mechanical and aesthetic modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend rides are another popular club activity. On Oct. 28, members of the 
Mustang Owners Club plan to caravan to Hearst Castle in San Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows and sojourns aside, the clubs' common mission is the preservation and 
restoration of the Mustang, one of the most popular cars in automotive history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Mustang's appeal is that it is America's first affordable, true 
sports car," said Paul Croswhite of Lake View Terrace, president of Pacific 
Mustang Club and owner of 10 Mustangs, most in near-mint condition. "It is 
versatility and economy, a combination of raw power and luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 Automotive aficionados have long heralded Ford's creation for its ability to 
suit a variety of tastes and pocketbooks. During the 1960s, the Mustang 
triggered the so-called "pony-car" craze that led to the creation of the 
Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird -- sporty vehicles designed to provide 
more bang for the buck. 
</P>
<P>
 But none has equaled the Mustang's impact. Nearly 6.8 million Mustangs have 
rolled off assembly lines, and the car's popularity remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no denying that there is a mystique about the Mustang," Ford 
spokesman John Clinard said. "For all its flair, it is a very practical car." 
</P>
<P>
 Most club members own a Mustang at least 20 years old, Pottratz said. 
Nostalgia and a taste for older body styles are the reasons. Moreover, fully 
restored vintage Mustangs retain their value. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Cunningham of Van Nuys, chairman of the Mustang Owners Club of 
California, is an impassioned owner of two mint-condition models: a 1966 dark 
blue coupe and a 1966 candy-apple red convertible. Cunningham estimates the 
value of the convertible at $25,000. The car's sticker price was about $2,600. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mustang came along as a fresh, new, forward-looking, forward-thinking 
design," Cunningham said. "It just had a look to it, like it was raring to go. 
I love that sporty look of the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mustangs in less-than-pristine condition can have a hold on their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores Laing and her husband, Bob, of Van Nuys own three Mustangs and belong 
to both clubs. She learned on their 25th wedding anniversary just how much the 
family Mustangs mean to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the mistake of asking him, 'If you could do anything all over again, 
would you do anything differently?' " she said. "He said, 'Yes. I'd have bought 
a Mustang brand-new.' " Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Mustang Magic."

 For many people, mention the word school and they'll grimace. Everyone's had 
bad experiences with sadistic third-grade teachers, droning algebra lectures in 
high school or late-night cram sessions in college. 
</P>
<P>
 But learning doesn't have to invoke such painful memories. There are many 
courses in a range of subjects offered locally that can further our careers or 
simply keep the kids entertained. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 THE MYSTERY OF WRITING: You've always known you were destined to be the next 
John Grisham or Joseph Wambaugh, but the next big crime novel is gathering dust 
inside your head. The problem? How do you write about cops and robbers if the 
only brush you've had with the law is a parking ticket? 
</P>
<P>
 In Scene of the Crime, you'll learn the nitty-gritty of how police officers 
and detectives go about their work: an officer's typical day, the techniques 
and procedures for investigating murder, sex crimes and other mayhem, and how a 
policeman talks -- so you can fine-tune your dialogue.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CATERING TO DIFFERENT CROWDS; NANCY'S HEALTHY KITCHEN IS A 
DIETER'S DELIGHT. BUT IF YOU CRAVE CALORIES, TRY PASTAS AND PASTRIES AT L.A. 
GOURMET.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy's Healthy Kitchen is a cheery little cafe that fancies itself a 
high-style, low-fat restaurant. It's brightened up with ivy-colored wallpaper 
and dis plays of prettily wrapped specialty foods. The clientele is athletic, 
robust and heavily female, more often than not turned out in workout garb. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, fat-free cooking is an established feature of the '90s, and I like the 
idea. What I argue with is an irrational insistence to make indulgence conform 
to New Age standards. Here's an example: At Nancy's front counter, I heard a 
customer remark to one of the chefs, "I've got to find a way to make really 
decadent desserts low, low calorie." 
</P>
<P>
 There's the rub. Why not be content with fresh fruits or raw vegetables, 
leaving lasagna and glazed chocolate muffins to the Rabelaisians among us? That 
customer's mentality could be what leads a business such as this one to attempt 
the impossible -- credible vegetable lasagna and glazed chocolate doughnuts. 
The lasagna comes off dry and austere, and the doughnuts have a flavor that a 
friend compared to soap. My feeling is, you want a muffin? Eat a real muffin. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you want health food, eat some of the really tasty dishes here, such as 
delicious air-fried potatoes, which are not trying to mimic decadence. The air 
fries showcase the best in modern technology, cutting back on fat without 
sacrificing flavor. These ridged potato chunks char slightly on the outside 
edges, soften on the inside and retain a crisp skin. For a real treat, try a 
basket with a side of buttermilk-based ranch dressing. No wonder takeout 
customers practically line up to buy these potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The salads are good, too, low-fat as nature intended them to be. Chinese 
chicken salad is made with shredded lettuce, chicken breast, snow peas, 
scallions, sesame seeds, fat-free sesame chips and a low-fat sesame ginger 
dressing. The dilled potato salad is delightfully fragrant. 
</P>
<P>
 The turkey Reuben is made with low-fat cheese, good sauerkraut and spicy 
turkey pastrami, then grilled oil-free on a non-stick grill. Baked potatoes are 
another good bet, either plain or stuffed with turkey chili and low-fat 
dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll pass when it comes to Nancy's Styrofoam-textured muffins or any of 
the low-fat cookies or biscotti. They feel like straw in the mouth, and worse, 
make me yearn for a nice hot fudge sundae. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 You might have trouble spotting L.A. Gourmet Baking Co. & Restaurant. It sits 
in a strip mall near the corner of Nordhoff Street and Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard, but the overhead sign you see driving up reads "Pastries by Hormoz." 
The sign is not in error, but it is nonetheless confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd describe the restaurant as a neighborhood Italian joint with an attached 
bakery (Hormoz is the baker). But this place is also a nightclub, with live 
jazz and good vocalists such as David Whitfield performing on weekends for no 
cover, even if the candle-lit, plant-filled interior recalls a '60s cafe more 
than a sophisticated night spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's food is slightly more focused than its concept, if less 
unexpected. Chef Ricardo Reynoso has been around -- he worked at Malibu's Tra 
di Noi and Beverly Hills' Rangoon Racket Club -- but what he does here isn't 
particularly creative. Only the lead appetizer is a real eye-catcher, and 
that's because it's beluga caviar at $30 an ounce. Could it be on the menu 
because pastry chef Hormoz is a native of Iran, home to the beluga sturgeon? 
</P>
<P>
 Reynoso's menu is mostly pastas, entrees and a few salads. The garlic bread 
has a twist, having been baked with a topping of pesto and tomato sauce in 
addition to the usual garlic rub. Fusilli alla salmon is an uninspiring but 
reasonable bowlful of pasta spirals with smoked salmon in a dilled tomato 
sauce. Better is the penne alla melanzana , short pasta tubes with eggplant, 
mushrooms, spinach, garlic and a healthy dose of mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees include costolette di maiale (pork chops in a somewhat busy 
apple-walnut-mushroom sauce), a workmanlike breaded veal Milanese and a 
butterflied New York steak with aromatic herbs. Dinners come with salad, 
vegetable and potato, and the portions tend to be large. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way in you pass a giant dessert case, and you are bound to be seduced 
by something. The selections are too numerous to mention, but you can expect 
things like tiramisu, chocolate cake, tarte tatin and many others, all baked on 
the premises by Hormoz himself. The desserts are fine, though none impressed 
any of us particularly. I'd say they impress the locals, though, because L.A. 
Gourmet Baking Co. & Restaurant fills up with a vengeance on weekends.

FOR FORMER O.C. PREP STAR, BIBLE BEATS COLLEGE, FOOTBALL; RELIGION: THE CHURCH

COACHES ARE BAFFLED.

<P>
 Leon Vickers couldn't have been a better high school football player. As a 
linebacker at Rancho Alamitos in 1992, he was all-league, all-county, all-state 
and All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Vickers took his honors and his rock-solid, 6-foot, 210-pound frame 
to Stanford, where he started one game at outside linebacker as a freshman; by 
spring practice, he had moved himself into a full-time starting position. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Cardinal prepared this week for Saturday's game at Arizona State, 
trying to shake itself out of a 1-2-1 start, Vickers' body and mind were far 
removed from the Palo Alto campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers is back home, working at a factory that makes screws for helicopters 
and airplanes. He is not attending school, instead giving much of his time and 
energy to a Garden Grove church he says will prepare him properly for a life 
beyond this one. But his decision to give up a promising football career, not 
to mention a valuable scholarship to one of the nation's finest universities, 
has baffled family, friends and former coaches, teammates and educators, and 
they wonder if he's being unduly influenced by the church. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vickers, 19, says it's a decision he made on his own, guided by the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watch Stanford on TV, sometimes I wish that could be me," he said. 
"But I know I'm doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret it." 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually will, many tell him. Bill Walsh, the Stanford football coach who 
led the San Francisco 49ers to three National Football League titles in the 
1980s, tried over the summer to persuade Vickers to return, even asking some of 
his former 49er players to make a pitch. But phone calls, visits and letters 
from across the country only seem to have strengthened Vickers' commitment to 
the Church of Christ, whose followers believe in strict interpretation of the 
Bible and form what they say is part of a growing, nationwide network of 
autonomous congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at what's going to benefit me spiritually," Vickers said this 
week. "They're looking at what's going to benefit me materially." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Byrd, Vickers' best friend at Rancho Alamitos, left a starting running 
back spot at Columbia University and transferred to Stanford this year on 
advice from Vickers. Now, Byrd is a third-string back attempting to earn what 
Vickers gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a deal," Byrd said from Palo Alto. "It's definitely a precious thing 
to have a scholarship here. I told him, 'I would die to be in your shoes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers said Byrd, like the rest of his friends and family, doesn't 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thrown away what a lot of kids want," Vickers said. "But I think I'm 
walking into what a lot of kids need and don't realize it. The church is 
looking beyond this life." 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers' exasperated mother, Nancy, isn't looking beyond, however. She still 
has hopes of reaching Leon and getting him back into college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never willing to give up," she said. "I may take a break now and then 
because it's so strenuous. But I'll get him back. I know God will give me my 
son back." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers said she began to lose her son during his senior year of high 
school, when he began attending classes at the Church of Christ. At the time, 
her husband, James, was in the Persian Gulf War, and Leon was being heavily 
recruited by Stanford and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recruiters were all over him," she said. "There was a lot of pressure then, 
and that's when he went to his first Bible study." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon attended the class with a school friend and was hooked immediately. "I 
just went," he said, "and the things I heard, there was no denying them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers said her son has always been more religious than the rest of the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been seeking the Lord in some way," she said. "He's always gone 
to Bible study." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nancy Vickers said she realized this was more than that when Leon came 
home for the winter holidays during his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Christmas, he told me he wasn't celebrating Christmas or Easter or any 
of the (mainstream) holidays," she said. "It started to hit home then." 
</P>
<P>
 Once her son was away from home and the church, Nancy Vickers says, she 
figured he would be able to concentrate on football and school. But she didn't 
realize the Church of Christ also had a congregation in Vallejo, some 90 
minutes from Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really backfired on me," she said. "Once he got up there, they snatched 
him from me." 
</P>
<P>
 During spring practice, Vickers began asking Walsh if he could leave workouts 
early. The coach allowed Vickers to leave one practice per week 45 minutes 
ahead of schedule but wouldn't agree to three early days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started realizing how much of the Bible I do need," Vickers said. "It takes 
work to go to heaven. The more Scripture I can put into my mind, the more 
filthiness I can get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, Walsh and Vickers negotiated how much practice time Vickers 
would be able to miss this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Walsh was understanding," Nancy Vickers said. "He said he'd give Leon 
two nights a week. The man has bent over backward for Leon." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vickers didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "My priorities are learning about God," he said. "It was a shame, because I 
love to play football. In the church, once you add something on, you can't take 
it off. I didn't want to give half of myself to God." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vickers said he was playing better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be starting at strong safety this year," he said. "I had an awesome 
spring. It was going to be good. Just like in high school, it took me a year of 
adjustment. But in spring ball, it just clicked. I was a man out there. I know 
I could have played pro ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Vickers said his mind only occasionally wanders back to the football 
field. He quotes from the Bible, Ecclesiastes 12:13: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'To fear God and keep his commandments. This is the whole duty of man.' 
That's just what we're all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, say the Church of Christ is all about something else. Priscilla 
Coates, chairwoman of the Los Angeles affiliate of Cult Awareness, which 
describes itself as a national preventive education organization, says the 
Church of Christ is "not a safe group." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any group that teaches a program of manipulation or undue influence and makes 
you believe your past life is all evil is a dangerous group," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers, who said he spends about 20 hours a week involved in church-related 
activities with about 35 others, denies it is dangerous or that the Church of 
Christ could be called a cult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing like that," he said. "We're real big on book, chapter and verse. 
The things we're doing are supported by Scripture. None of our practices are 
bizarre or strange. We sing songs and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers attended one class with Leon and said, "I didn't care for what I 
heard." Since her son became involved, she has researched the Church of 
Christ's practices and hasn't liked what she found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same principles the Nazis used on the people of Germany," she said. 
"What Hitler did with his people, that's what they've done to my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Said James Vickers, who attended the same class: "They talked about the Bible 
and tore every other religion apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Smith, a Church of Christ member who teaches Bible classes to the Garden 
Grove congregation, said she can relate to the Vickers' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand, but this man did not make this decision coming to one Bible 
class," she said. "We're not averse to education, but he had to make a choice, 
and God is at the top of the list. To me, he's an awfully inspiring kid. 
Believe me, he'd probably still be at Stanford if there wasn't a conflict with 
what he wanted to do with his evenings." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who said she is a former Catholic, dismisses those who label her church 
a cult. She says the Church of Christ is not affiliated with the controversial 
Boston Church of Christ Movement, started in 1979 by Kip McKean (who reportedly 
lives in Manhattan Beach), a sect that uses "disciplining methods" in which 
each baptized member is subject to a "discipliner" who gives advice on 
spiritual problems and daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith says her church has no group leader or headquarters. She said each 
church is autonomous, with congregations across the country. (The Garden Grove 
church also is not connected to the more mainstream Churches of Christ or 
United Church of Christ.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers defines his church as "the only one that teaches baptism for remission 
of sins. That baptism is necessary for salvation. Where the Scripture speaks, 
we speak; where the Scripture's silent, we're silent." 
</P>
<P>
 But Coates sees a common thread in such movements. "The sad thing is the 
increasing isolation from family and friends and the increasing dependence on 
the group," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers said she rarely sees Leon anymore, but at least she sees him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got control, and there's not much we can do," she said. "The only 
good thing is he is in my home. Once he leaves, then I'll really worry." 
</P>
<P>
 And she says her husband already feels as if the oldest of his three children 
is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hurt him deeply," she said. "He says, 'I've got two more children to 
deal with, I can't worry about Leon anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 James Vickers, retired from the Air Force and working as a security guard, 
still attends every Stanford home game. Nancy hasn't made any of them. "My 
stomach can't handle it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has somewhat accepted his son's new life, James said he remains 
"bitter" toward the Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that any church that could come between a kid and his education has to 
be undermining," he said. "But who knows? This may be for him. I don't think 
so. I told him he's making a mistake and that he could have both (college and 
the church), but he doesn't see it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 James said he moved his family to Garden Grove from Florida specifically to 
enhance Leon's football and academic careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big shock to the whole family . . . a lot of hopes were on him," he 
said. "We did a lot of sacrificing getting him to Rancho Alamitos. We had heard 
they had a good football program and that it was a good school." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Vickers' sons is David, a Rancho Alamitos freshman who appears to 
be as athletically gifted as his older brother; he has already run for more 
than 500 yards and has returned three interceptions, a punt and a kickoff for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 David chose to wear No. 2 instead of the No. 20 Leon wore for the Vaqueros and 
James also wore during his high school days. 
</P>
<P>
 "David's dealt with this now, but he didn't want to be compared to his 
brother," said Nancy Vickers, whose daughter, Detra, is a Rancho Alamitos 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Case, the Rancho Alamitos head football coach who was the Vaqueros' 
defensive coordinator during Leon Vickers' career, said Vickers still comes by 
the school and lifts weights. Case said he is "still in great shape and cut 
like he always was." 
</P>
<P>
 After trying to persuade Vickers several times this summer to return to 
Stanford, Case said he has become too frustrated with the situation and now has 
a hard time talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion was he'd be more useful to the church if he led a productive life 
and graduated from Stanford," Case said. "He had a chance to get out of the 
middle class. Having a bachelor's degree from Stanford would be more valuable 
than your average state school." 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers said he intends to return to college next semester at Golden West 
College. After he earns his associate of arts degree there, Vickers said, he 
will go to Long Beach State and major in liberal arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't see it," she said. "When he first joined, they said he'd still 
be able to play pro football. He's supposed to be taking a class now. All that 
college talk is just a ploy to appease the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 And the talk about after college? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get just a job," Leon said. "My goals have changed from wanting to 
make millions to wanting to provide for myself. I'll take any job, as long as 
it doesn't conflict with my Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Miller, Vickers' head coach at Rancho Alamitos, believes Vickers is 
selling himself short. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every aspect of his life, he's been an overachiever," said Miller, who has 
also done extensive research on the Church of Christ. "I had him in algebra 
class, and he'd be camped at my door at 7 in the morning asking questions about 
the homework. I told him, 'God gave you a great hand, you have to play the hand 
you're dealt.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him for four hours one day. I just didn't want him to wake up one 
day and say to me, 'Coach, what the hell did I do? Why didn't somebody say 
something?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, like Vickers, said an NFL career was definitely realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't walk into the Pac-10 (Conference) as a true freshman and start," 
Miller said. "If Bill Walsh says he can play, what scout isn't going to listen 
to him? I'd bet Bill Walsh would still take him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Several attempts were made to reach Walsh, but he did not return phone calls. 
James Vickers said he spoke with Walsh three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walsh told me the door is still open for Leon," James Vickers said. "He said 
Leon is still welcome back if he can get himself together." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd said his teammates still ask about Vickers, but not as much as they used 
to. He said he has moved on with his life, even if his friend won't come with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my backbone," Byrd said. "He was always there for me. He told me I 
could play at this level, and he didn't lie. I tried to be there for him, and 
he wouldn't listen to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know why I'm feeling sorry for him. As long as it's something he 
wants to do, I guess it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers says she still hopes this will all prove to have been just a bad 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leon dated this girl through high school who we didn't think was really right 
for him," she said. "One day, he finally woke up and said, 'Wow, what was I 
doing?' I have a funny feeling the same thing will happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leon Vickers says the change is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to explain my beliefs to people, and I know it's not easy," he said. "I 
can understand where they're coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought like that a year ago."

CLINTON CALLS HAITI MISSION A SUCCESS, PRAISES U.S. TROOPS; CARIBBEAN: CONGRESS 
BACKS OFF IMPOSING DEADLINE ON THE OPERATION, BUT DECLINES TO GIVE FULL 
SUPPORT. PRESIDENT SAYS HAITIANS 'ARE MOVING FROM FEAR TO FREEDOM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and his top aides declared the U.S. intervention in Haiti a 
success Thursday, seeking to persuade Congress and the public that the effort 
is working -- and that it is worth continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both houses of Congress, bowing to the Administration's arguments, backed away 
from earlier attempts to impose a deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops from the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate and House, persuaded by the Pentagon that a deadline could endanger 
U.S. forces, approved a resolution merely urging the President to pull the 
troops out as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The House also early today rejected, by an overwhelming 398-27 vote, another 
measure authorizing the operation until March 1 that would have allowed the 
President to extend that date indefinitely. Republicans said the 
Democrat-backed authorization would have been an endorsement of Clinton's 
decision to commit troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of White House efforts to win public credit for a military action 
that has gone well, Clinton visited the aircraft carrier Eisenhower in port at 
Norfolk, Va., and told sailors and aviators: "Thanks to your efforts, the 
Haitian people are moving from fear to freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on one of the nuclear-powered ship's giant hangar decks, the 
President listed the accomplishments of the mission so far: U.S. forces have 
disarmed Haitian paramilitaries, removed heavy weapons from the Haitian army, 
restored electric power to two cities, seized control of the country's radio 
and television broadcasting facilities, allowed the Haitian Parliament to 
reopen and restored the mayor of Port-au-Prince to his office -- "in less than 
three weeks," Clinton noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You brought a new day to a people who thought they would never get it," he 
said. "Your country is proud of you." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, other officials reinforced the message in a White House 
briefing, saying that a planned handoff of the U.S. mission to the United 
Nations next year is "on track" and praising exiled Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide for his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have established basic security," a senior Clinton aide said. "The 
capacity for organized, centrally controlled resistance is over. The capacity 
for violence certainly is still present." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the decision to use U.S. troops to police Haiti's cities, he added, 
the Administration is trying to maintain limits on their role. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission of our troops in Haiti is not nation-building," he said. "Our 
mission is to assure a transfer of power, create a secure environment . . . and 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Another official repeated the Administration's strong opposition to a 
congressionally fixed deadline for the operation, saying it would only 
encourage Haitian forces that want to stop the United States from restoring 
Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Clinton plans a news conference at 11 a.m. PDT today, in part 
to repeat the message that the operation in Haiti should be recognized as a 
major foreign policy success. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate backed away from setting a firm deadline when it adopted, by a 91-8 
vote, a bipartisan resolution that called only for the troops to be pulled out 
"as soon as possible." The House later passed an identical resolution, 258-167. 
</P>
<P>
 Relieved that the Haiti operation has gone off without incident, House members 
who last week were clamoring for an early withdrawal also rejected, by a 
225-205 vote, a GOP resolution that would have called for an immediate pullout. 
They set up another vote in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting into the early hours, the House rejected the resolution authorizing 
the troops to remain in Haiti until March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it had passed, that resolution would have been largely symbolic 
because the Senate's refusal to embrace a withdrawal date would mean that it 
would not become law. But that still did not stop lawmakers on both sides of 
the Capitol from spending the waning hours of the 103rd Congress bitterly 
debating Clinton's Haiti policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County congressmen voted with the GOP minority on a series of 
amendments limiting the scope of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) said the fractious, late-night debate was 
indicative of "the level of distrust and fear everyone up here has about this 
operation. . . . The American people are in no mood to have the wool pulled 
over their eyes on this, not even a little bit. Neither the majority of the 
American people, nor the majority of members of Congress, approved of this 
operation beforehand, nor do they today." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), said: "Aristide is not worth one drop 
of American blood. I'm dedicated to supporting our troops, and the best way we 
can do that is through a quick and orderly withdrawal from Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) echoed Dornan's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case that Haiti represents the national security interest of the U.S. has 
not been made," he said. "Haiti is not worth one American life, and our troops 
should start coming home now, and none of them should miss Christmas with their 
families." 
</P>
<P>
 Warning that Clinton should not take comfort from the fact the Senate 
resolution was bipartisan, Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Republicans 
oppose setting a withdrawal date in part because they do not want to imply that 
they support the occupation until that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Although even many Democrats said privately that they share some of Dole's 
reservations about "mission creep," or expansion of the U.S. role in Haiti, the 
constant, almost vituperative GOP criticism of Clinton prompted Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to complain that the Republicans seemed to be 
"disappointed" by the fact that "things have gone so well in Haiti" over the 
last two weeks.

POLICE IGNORED OWN POLICIES IN O.C. ARSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police ignored their own missing-person policies that would have brought to 
light the alibi of a Laguna Beach arson suspect before he was wrongfully 
charged, a ranking police official acknowledged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Ken Head, who oversees all Fullerton police investigations, said that an 
internal "breakdown" left county prosecutors, fire officials and police 
investigators believing that Jose Soto Martinez was a transient with no 
relatives in the United States, when in fact family members had visited the 
department twice in three days to report him missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who was in a nearby cell both times his mother sought assistance at 
the police station's front desk, was being held in connection with three small 
fires he was accused of setting in Fullerton, and was also being questioned 
about the firestorm that had devastated parts of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just shouldn't have happened," Head said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being acted upon promptly, the missing-person report filed by 
Martinez's mother "got put on the back burner, and got put on the back burner, 
and then, several days later, it all came to light." 
</P>
<P>
 There are regular procedures that detectives are supposed to follow any time a 
missing-person report is filed, Head said. "You just have to go through the 
steps -- A, B, C, D -- and we just didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the family had identified the missing man as Jaime Saille, and he 
had identified himself to police investigators as Jose Soto Martinez, Head 
acknowledged that the Fullerton police knew from a criminal history check that 
Martinez had used both names in the past, and that the two names had been 
entered almost immediately in the department's computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the names entered in our system," Head said. "That was our breakdown. 
If we had run our missing-person report earlier, we could have tied the two 
names together instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to police, prosecutors and fire investigators, the mother who was 
pleading for help in finding her son could have spared them the embarrassment 
they endured when charges that he ignited the Laguna fire had to be dismissed 
-- charges based on a confession that turned out to be bogus. 
</P>
<P>
 After Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi announced at a news 
conference that Martinez had been formally charged with setting the blaze, the 
mother came forward with irrefutable evidence that her son was 1,200 miles away 
in a Mexican prison when the Oct. 27, 1993, fires roared into Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late Thursday, Fullerton Police Chief Patrick McKinley had insisted that 
the mix-up occurred because "we had one name for him, and he gave us an alias, 
and it just didn't click." 
</P>
<P>
 But both Head and Sgt. Mike Maynard told The Times that both names surfaced 
immediately after his Sept. 16 arrest, when police checked his identity through 
the state's Criminal Information Index. They said a clerk at the Fullerton jail 
entered both names -- Martinez and Saille -- into the department's computers 
that same day. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the investigator who was assigned the missing-persons report had made the 
normal inquiry (to the department's own computer system), the (alias) would 
have been a hit, and we would have known right away," Head said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to violating their own department procedures, officers may have 
run afoul of state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day that Martinez's mother, Teresa Campos, tried to file a 
missing-person report, she was told to come back in 72 hours if he had not 
shown up by then. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 state law, however, says that "it is the duty of all law enforcement 
agencies to immediately assist any person who is attempting to make a report of 
a missing person or runaway." 
</P>
<P>
 Head said the Fullerton department has a policy of declining to accept 
missing-person reports on adults for the first 72 hours, unless there are 
"extenuating circumstances." McKinley explained that those extenuating 
circumstances might include instances in which the missing person is someone 
who has a mental problem, is in need of medication or is believed to be the 
victim of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, officials with both the Anaheim and Santa Ana police departments 
say they accept missing-person reports on anyone immediately, regardless of the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 When Martinez's mother returned a second time, on Sept. 19, she told the 
Fullerton police that her son left her house at 7 a.m. three days before and 
did not show up for work at Terra Universal, an Anaheim business that 
manufactures semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos is quoted in the report as saying her son "has been depressed . . . for 
unknown reasons. He has never disappeared in the past and he pretty much stays 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 The detective who mishandled the case -- whom Head declined to name -- has not 
been disciplined but "counseled" by a supervisor below the rank of captain. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the missing-person report was added to his workload, Head 
explained, the detective was handling 30 to 35 other missing-persons reports, 
as well as homicide, rape, sexual assault and other cases handled by the 
six-member crimes against persons unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The detective was going through his files, and went through that case, and it 
didn't become a priority at the time," Head said. "It's a lesson to be learned 
for our department. We have a whole myriad of cases over here, but 
missing-persons cases are important. This was an oversight and an uncommon 
occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Fullerton police officials continue to suspect that Martinez was 
somehow involved in the Laguna fire, and McKinley is still willing to wager six 
months' salary on the theory, they acknowledge that charges probably never 
would have been brought if they had made the connection earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have had the family's input sooner, and have gone down to Mexico and 
found out about the prison," Head said. "If we had done that sooner, a case 
probably would not have been filed and then dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans agreed. "We all wish that there had 
been a connection, and we could have figured out he had a mama in Fullerton," 
Evans said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said he understood how such an oversight could have been made, but 
thought the police department may want review its procedures in light of this 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if I were the Fullerton police chief I would have to say that it's a 
scenario we're going to take a look at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the field of missing persons say that cases involving adults have a 
lower priority than those involving children. 
</P>
<P>
 "With adults there is a far greater likelihood to treat it less seriously and 
not investigate it immediately unless there is clear evidence of foul play," 
said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is scheduled to appear in Municipal Court in Fullerton today 
concerning the three Fullerton fires in which he still faces charges. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, his attorneys questioned the reliability of the district 
attorney's evidence in the Fullerton case, given the foul-up with the Laguna 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sure have to wonder about the prosecution's claims," said Deputy Public 
Defender Jim Egar. "I think a good healthy dose of skepticism is in order now." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Campos said her son was more relaxed when she visited him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He is "a little more tranquil" but remains saddened because of "his personal 
problems and his fears." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing he commented on was . . . this fear, a phobia I guess," Campos 
said. "I don't know from what, he's afraid to leave and go on the street. I 
think it's because of his personal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the pending Fullerton case, she said she avoided discussing it to avoid 
making him depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't talk about the case that much," she said. "I purposely kept it 
light, talked of his family here to remind him that we're supporting him. You 
know, gave him words of support."

REP. BEILENSON STRUGGLING IN REELECTION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he faces voters in November, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
is struggling against a mighty anti-incumbent riptide and a well-financed GOP 
foe in Richard Sybert, a former top aide in the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 These perils have thrust the 61-year-old Beilenson's bid for a 10th term into 
the national limelight. CNN has focused on Beilenson's plight, as have a slew 
of political pundits. All insist that they smell blood in the affluent 24th 
District, which takes in Sherman Oaks, Malibu and the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson, a senior member of the powerful House Rules Committee, is far 
from defenseless as he enters what is likely to be the toughest battle of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging outlines of Beilenson's strategy are classic. He is not your 
average politician, Beilenson maintains: not a Beltway insider, not a slavish 
poll watcher, not a special interest tool. In other words, not an incumbent bum 
who should be thrown out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is not new to Beilenson. The congressman, who served in the state 
Legislature before going to Washington in 1976, used it in 1992 to stymie 
another foe, former Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who is now 
running for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
 With potent effect, Beilenson boasted that he took no special interest 
campaign contributions from political action committees but that McClintock 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that wasn't enough to establish himself as a different kind of 
politician, Beilenson in April, 1992, also split dramatically with his liberal 
roots to support a constitutional amendment to prohibit children of illegal 
aliens from automatically becoming U. S. citizens just because they were born 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 When the votes were tallied, Beilenson scored a lopsided 56%-38% victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Analogies can be dangerous, however. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not 1992. In that year, the collapse of the Bush-Quayle campaign 
caused shock waves throughout the California GOP ticket. In 1994, after two 
years of Democratic hegemony in the White House and the Congress, the undertow 
pulling at incumbent Democrats is so powerful that it even appears to be vexing 
the reelection bids of such icons as House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) 
and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Sybert, who is president of a Santa Barbara-based toy design firm, 
another McClintock. Sybert, 42, is a moderate, while rightward-leaning 
McClintock had his flanks easily turned by Beilenson in the bid for the 
district's centrist vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very difficult for Tony Beilenson to paint me with the same 
brush he used on McClintock," Sybert said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can Beilenson credibly claim to be a new breed politician, Sybert has 
charged. The incumbent has used his franking privileges to flood his district 
with taxpayer-financed mailings that are simply an adjunct to his reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Roll Call Magazine, a Washington-based political tip sheet, 
Beilenson was the 23rd biggest spender on franked mailings during the first 
half of 1994. And as the third highest ranking Democratic member of the Rules 
Committee, Beilenson is top lieutenant in the ruling partisan gang, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Beilenson is a classic liberal," Sybert said the night he won the 
Republican nomination. "He's soft on crime, weak on defense and tough on 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters of the 24th District should be outraged, Sybert added, that Beilenson 
voted for Clinton's deficit reduction plan, which resulted in a hefty tax boost 
that hit the district's large upper-middle class hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson admits that Sybert is a formidable foe. "It's a competitive 
district," he said in an interview. "It's a district the Republicans are 
targeting, and it's different than it was in 1992. McClintock was very 
conservative, and 1992 was a very big year for Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Beilenson team is loading up on Sybert ammunition, pointing out the 
challenger's appetite for political action committee contributions and to the 
fact that he is a 24th District newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the governor's Office of Planning and Research, the Harvard Law 
School-educated Sybert was the top policy wonk in the Wilson Administration 
from 1991 to 1993 after spending 13 years as a lawyer in a major Downtown Los 
Angeles law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert jump-started his bid for the 24th District GOP nomination by loaning 
his campaign more than $420,000 of his own money. He swamped his four 
Republican foes and was quickly dubbed a rising star by the Republican national 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the 24th District has hosted a parade of GOP luminaries who 
have stopped by to laud Sybert and help him raise money. Last month, they 
included two Cabinet secretaries from the Reagan Administration, Jack Kemp and 
Edward Bennett. Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is scheduled soon, and last week's 
visitor was House GOP leader Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting that Beilenson was beatable, Gingrich pledged the maximum support 
possible for Sybert's campaign from the GOP national party even as he helped 
the candidate raise $30,000 from local sources at a brunch at the luxurious 
Lake Sherwood estate of a Ventura County car dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issues, Sybert backs Proposition 187, the statewide ballot initiative 
to deny key public services to illegal immigrants; has signed the GOP's 
so-called "Contract With America," a pledge to back a balanced budget amendment 
and congressional term limits, and has advocated tougher laws on crime. But 
while his rhetoric is often tough, Sybert is a moderate on the hot-button 
topics of gun control and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has clearly given the Beilenson team a workout, but the incumbent's 
crew is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Gingrich visit only further demonstrated how deeply the Sybert 
campaign is indebted to Republican outsiders and the money they can attract, 
said Craig Miller, Beilenson's campaign consultant. That this would be the 
case, Miller contended, is not surprising: After all, Sybert is a newcomer to 
the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich Sybert has no inherent support in the community," Miller said. "He's 
totally dependent on Republican powerbrokers and PACs for his support." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, records show that Sybert did not establish his residency in the 24th 
District until Oct. 4, 1993, and that he has assiduously courted business PAC 
funding. On Sept. 24, he held a fund-raiser in Washington just for PAC donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also accused Sybert of being an opportunist who originally planned to 
run for the 27th Congressional District seat that includes Burbank, Glendale 
and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) has also confirmed that Sybert, who owns 
a home in Pasadena, where he had resided prior to moving to Calabasas in the 
West Valley, had considered challenging him in this year's GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beilenson points with pride to his deep, longtime involvement with 
measures to protect the Santa Monica Mountains, his success in amending this 
year's federal crime bill to provide $1.8 billion to reimburse states hit 
hardest by the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants in their state prisons, 
and his vote to support Clinton's deficit reduction plan.

DANA PARSONS: COLUMNIST MUST CONFESS: HE STILL BELIEVES THE D.A.'S ALIBI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This just in: Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi has charged an itinerant Anaheim 
dishwasher with the murder of Jimmy Hoffa. The dishwasher came to Capizzi's 
office late one night this week and confessed to killing Hoffa in 1975 because 
"he looked at me funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Gleeful over cracking the caper, Capizzi called a news conference to declare 
the Hoffa case closed. He said the dishwasher, who would have been 14 at the 
time Hoffa disappeared, acted alone and used an "iron-plated spatula he ordered 
from Soldier of Fortune magazine" in the slaying. "You don't see many of 
those," Capizzi said. Although the man originally referred to his victim as 
"Johnny Hoffa" and won't say where he buried the body, Capizzi said he trusts 
the confession because "I've been around a long time and, believe me, I can 
smell a bad story a mile away." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, we kid! 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the D.A.'s office doesn't have Hoffa's killer any more than it has the 
Laguna Beach arsonist. After this week's events, they may never announce 
charges against anyone, ever. 
</P>
<P>
 You just know Capizzi wants to shoot somebody, maybe himself. We hardly ever 
see the guy, then he surfaces in front of the cameras at a news conference last 
Friday to announce that the county's biggest crime ever has been solved, and 
five days later he's back in court saying, " Uh, judge, about those arson 
charges. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Some have been eager to blast the D.A.'s office over the case, saying it 
should never have filed charges against Jose Soto Martinez. Nobody enjoys 
kicking politicians when they're down more than I, but this case doesn't 
warrant it. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being a cause celebre , this is a case that, had it involved a liquor 
store holdup on a Saturday night, wouldn't even make the papers. Stripped to 
its essentials, it's about a guy who confessed to starting the Laguna fire and 
who then allegedly gave authorities enough information to flesh out his story. 
When an unshakable alibi surfaced, the charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what's been reported, filing charges wasn't unreasonable. It can't be 
argued that charging the wrong man has made any difference in the investigation 
of the fires, because that came to a standstill long ago. Nor was Martinez 
unfairly detained because of the charges, because he's been jailed without bail 
since Sept. 16 in connection with allegedly setting other fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutorial misconduct? Nah, that's too much of a stretch. This borders on 
"no harm, no foul." The egg on Capizzi's face is enough punishment for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi probably didn't even say "I'm sorry" to Martinez for the mistake, even 
if it would be rather awkward to apologize for charging someone with a crime to 
which they confessed. Maybe the apology could go something like, "We're sorry 
you couldn't have been the one to start the fire. We know how important it was 
to you." 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say we should close the book on this case completely. A 
time-honored civics lesson lies within. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit: Just because the district attorney charges someone doesn't mean they 
did it. In this case, it didn't even mean they were in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it would streamline our justice system if district attorneys charged 
only guilty people. We wouldn't need defense attorneys, judges or juries. Many 
of our citizens believe that's how the system works, and those who do should be 
forced to read the stories about the Martinez case and write a theme paper on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, although my instinct in this case is to give Capizzi the benefit of the 
doubt, some niggling doubts linger in the recesses of my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 In no particular order, they are: 
</P>
<P>
 * To what extent was the mistake in charging Martinez driven by the desire to 
pin the fires on someone? 
</P>
<P>
 * To what extent was the decision to file charges against Martinez affected by 
his obviously muddled state of mind (he said he spoke to demons) and from his 
statements to authorities that he had no local relatives? In other words, did 
they think they had a patsy on their hands? 
</P>
<P>
 * In that regard -- and this gives me the most pause -- what if his mother 
hadn't lived in Fullerton and contacted police -- first to report him missing 
and then to break the news that he was in a Mexican jail when the fires broke 
out? What if he had been someone with no local ties at all? Just how far would 
this case have gone had Martinez stuck with his "confession"? Would a defense 
attorney necessarily have stumbled on the alibi without a relative's help? 
</P>
<P>
 In Martinez's case, those questions are academic and thank goodness. One can 
only wonder, though, how many other inmates have found themselves in his shoes 
but unable to prove an alibi somewhat less airtight than being in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, I'd rather not wonder about that. If nothing else, we've 
learned why we need those other lines of defense between the district attorney 
and state prison.

DOYLE, WOODS GIVE U.S. LEAD IN WORLD AMATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allen Doyle, Tiger Woods and John Harris gave the United States a two-stroke 
lead in the opening round of the World Amateur Team Championship Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-man squad finished five-under at 208. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle, 46, shot three-under-par 68 on the 6,562-yard Valley course near 
Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, of Cypress, and Harris each had 70. Todd Demsey shot a 72, which 
did not count. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden was second at 210. Fredric Jacobson's 67 for Sweden was the low round. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia was third, at 212, a shot ahead of the Great Britain and Ireland 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa was fifth at 214 and titleholder New Zealand shared sixth with 
Austria at 218. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who attracted the biggest gallery of the day, started poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at a two-way miss out there," Woods said. "I had no idea where 
the ball was going." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-over with two holes left, Woods hit a four-iron to 24 feet on the par-5 
eighth (his 17th hole) and made the putt for an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 He birdied his last hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly my swing clicked at the end," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford freshman said he was freezing when he started early in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so cold my hands felt they were going to fall off. I had no feel." he 
said.

PREP FOOTBALL; ESPERANZA QUARTERBACK GETS CHANCE TO AIR IT OUT; FOOTBALL: CHRIS 
STRETCH OFTEN HAS AS MANY AS FIVE RECEIVERS TO THROW TO, A MARKED CHANGE FROM 
PAST AZTEC STRATEGIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can almost see Chris Stretch beaming behind that facemask. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He backpedals, he looks and he sees not one, not two, but five receivers 
running pass routes -- all at the same time. What a selection. It's quarterback 
heaven, at least around Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs have shed that plow-boy image. A quarterback can limber up his 
throwing arm and do more than hand off these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Stretch said. "I feel like I'm in the pros. You go back there and 
there's a receiver open every time. We have five, six guys running routes." 
</P>
<P>
 That's five receivers, big guy. This isn't the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Stretch stretches things a bit. One can hardly blame the kid. He is, 
after all, getting to throw the football, something usually done out of 
desperation around Esperanza. Or it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Stretch was running the wing-T and, on many third downs, running 
for his life. There were nights he'd just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he can pick and choose receivers. Seven have caught at least four passes, 
and Brian Forth is third in the county with 24 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, long known for its mountain-like linemen and the running backs who 
scurried beneath them, has had success throwing the ball. The Aztecs, ranked 
third in Orange County, are 3-1, with the only blemish a 38-28 loss to 
second-ranked Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch, a senior, has thrown for 838 yards, seven touchdowns and only two of 
his passes have been intercepted. An improvement? He threw for only 612 yards 
and five touchdowns all of last season. He also had 10 passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes the new offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wing-T is predicated on the run," Stretch said. "We didn't run the ball 
too well at times last season. That put a lot of pressure on me." 
</P>
<P>
 How much pressure? 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Long Beach Poly game. Stretch was a clay pigeon and the Jackrabbits' 
immense front line didn't miss often. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch was six of 22 for 61 yards and had three passes picked off in the 10-3 
loss. He was sacked four times and took numerous other hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys came after him," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. "I think Chris 
was pretty shook up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stretch: "They were big and fast and they hit and hit real hard. Real 
hard. But that was no excuse for throwing three interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 It did leave a lasting impression. And Stretch hopes to return the favor 
tonight, when the Aztecs play Poly at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got some big-time redemption coming this week," Stretch said. "I want to 
come out and be a bulldog. I've really got to have a big game this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch thinks he can, armed with the new offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Meek had Stretch in mind when he shifted his philosophy. He had an experienced 
quarterback with a good arm. But the main priority was still the running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Dahrin Footman gained only 663 yards during the regular season a year 
ago. He had gained more than 1,000 as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dahrin would make the first guy miss, but there would be three others there 
to make the hit," Meek said. "There were nine defenders on the line. That's too 
many bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the field has opened things up. Footman has already gained 550 yards 
this season. "Dahrin needs to get the ball 25 times a game," Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just fine with Stretch, who was ready to embrace an offense no matter 
how many carries it got for Footman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like they say, the running game is a quarterback's best friend," Stretch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs had always run the ball well, in fact the wing-T was good enough to 
win one Southern Section title and share another. But the time had come to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 So committed was Meek to the new offense that he purchased a pitching machine 
-- one that hurled footballs -- to save his own arm during practice. Practices 
now begin with 30 minutes of pass patterns, supervised by Meek. 
</P>
<P>
 But by summer, about all Meek had was the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Aztecs' spring game, Stretch called a quarterback draw. The defense 
adjusted. Stretch didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 He was slammed to the ground and suffered a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gained six yards and then got drilled," Stretch said. "I guess I should 
have checked out of the play." 
</P>
<P>
 But the injury proved to be beneficial. Meek allowed Stretch to call plays for 
the freshman and junior varsity teams during summer passing leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 They would go over Stretch's strategy during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were two guys together the whole summer," Stretch said. "I was a student." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a quarterback again late in the summer, leading the Aztecs to a 
third-place finish in the Chino passing league tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch carried that success into the opener. He completed 11 of 15 passes for 
190 yards and three touchdowns in a 36-7 victory over Indio. 
</P>
<P>
 He rallied the Aztecs against Mater Dei the following week. The Monarchs had a 
31-14 lead in the second half, but Stretch threw two touchdown passes to make 
it 31-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this offense, if we get a couple touchdowns behind, no one really 
cares," Meek said. "We can come back. We can score points. If we got a couple 
down with the wing-T, it's a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need to remind Stretch of that. The Aztecs were down, 21-0, in the 
first quarter against Los Alamitos last season. They lost, 49-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch was four of 15 for 30 yards and had two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was a year ago. Stretch is winging it now instead of wing-T-ing it.

PREP FOOTBALL; SECODA LEADS VALENCIA PAST SUNNY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valencia quarterback Joe Secoda played a part in every point Thursday night, 
leading the Tigers to an 18-6 nonleague football victory over Sunny Hills at 
Valencia High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda threw for one score, ran for another, kicked a field goal and an extra 
point and ran in a two-point conversion.Secoda completed 12 of 17 passes for 
142 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia defense dominated the Lancers (1-4) throughout the final three 
quarters. Sunny Hills quarterback Greg Garand completed 13 of 32 passes for 157 
yards, but four of his passes were intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers got on the board first, on their second possession of the game. 
Garand hit Eric Hernandez for a 12-yard touchdown, capping an eight-play, 
84-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 6-0, the Tigers (3-1-1) scored on their second possession of the 
second quarter when Secoda ran in from two yards out. His kick gave the Tigers 
a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda increased the Tigers' lead just before halftime by making a 27-yard 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers' final score came with 2:13 left in the third quarter when Secoda 
hit Chris Roussin on a 14-yard score. Secoda then took the fumbled extra-point 
snap and ran in for the two-point conversion, giving the Tigers an 18-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia's Jermaine Gray had a game-high 103 yards in 21 carries. Chris 
Velotta had 54 yards in 12 carries for the Lancers. JON CLIFFORD

<P>
 Chris Young rushed for 154 yards and two touchdowns as Fullerton beat Norwalk 
Glenn, 41-7, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Young scored on runs of 31 and 14 yards, and had a touchdown run of 47 yards 
called back because of a clipping penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton built its big lead early. Glenn quarterback James Young fumbled on 
the fourth play of the game, and Fullerton's Joseph Emigh recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Fullerton quarterback Gabe Almanza, who was making his first 
start of the season, connected with Jayson Garcia on a 40-yard touchdown pass 
for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fullerton's first possession of the second quarter, Young capped a six-play 
drive with a 31-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Brickell gave Fullerton (3-2) a 20-0 halftime lead when he intercepted a 
pass by Young and returned it 27 yards for a touchdown with 1 minute 30 seconds 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton capped its scoring on a two-yard run by John Wilkie, Young's 14-yard 
run and a 61-yard punt return by Kyle Overby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' defense shut out Glenn (1-3-1) until the 2:40 mark of the fourth 
quarter, when Chris Harris caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Almanza completed nine of 12 passes for 131 yards and a touchdown. GABE

PREP FOOTBALL; UNIVERSITY BEATS SADDLEBACK WITH HIGHFIELD'S HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A seven-yard touchdown run by Tucker Highfield in the first quarter helped 
University defeat Saddleback, 24-6, in a nonleague game Thursday night at the 
Santa Ana Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Highfield led University (2-3) by rushing for 123 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Highfield's touchdown run, with seven minutes 11 seconds remaining in the 
first quarter, capped a 68-yard, seven-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
 University held Saddleback (1-4) to 98 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 University extended its lead to 14-0 on a nine-yard touchdown run by Stuart 
Meurer with 2:27 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, University's Stephen McKee sacked quarterback Brian 
Killingbeck, who fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepehr Sharifi recovered the ball and ran 54 yards for a touchdown to put 
University ahead, 21-0, with 28 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback got on the scoreboard when Danny Verino ran 75 yards for a 
touchdown with 7:25 left in the third quarter, to cut University's lead to 
21-6. The kick failed. 
</P>
<P>
 But University countered on its next drive. Charles Thompson kicked a 25-yard 
field goal with four minutes remaining in the third quarter to put the Trojans 
ahead, 24-6.

PREP FOOTBALL; GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE; ALLEN HURT IN RANCHO ALAMITOS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With his game of the year upcoming next week, Rancho Alamitos Coach Doug Case 
was simply looking to get through Thursday night's game against undermanned La 
Quinta unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Case's worst nightmare occurred on the next-to-last play of the first 
quarter when his star running back, Kevin Allen, went down with a sprained 
right ankle. Victory was never in doubt as Rancho Alamitos rolled over La 
Quinta, 49-13, at Bolsa Grande High, but Allen's status for next Friday's 
showdown with Los Amigos is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it's just a sprain," Case said. "We'll give it some therapy this week 
and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos led, 14-0, and Allen had already scored a touchdown when his 
ankle gave way on a sweep to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got hit on it right when I was planting," said Allen, who was unable to put 
any pressure on his ankle the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Allen wasn't needed much Thursday. Chris Young, the Vaqueros' 
other starting running back, took care of La Quinta almost by himself. He 
rushed for 138 yards and two touchdowns and scored on a punt that he blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros (3-2, 2-0 in league) also scored on interception returns by 
linebacker Bill Tevtilmez and sophomore Leo Kosi, who also rushed for 77 yards 
in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to get some polish to our offense and I thought we did that," Case 
said. "We started running on all cylinders. We would have liked to throw the 
ball more but it got out of hand early." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos starting quarterback John Frank completed three of three 
passes for 94 yards and a touchdown to Jeff Turbarg, who also intercepted two 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta starting quarterback Jason Gondringer (one for four, two 
interceptions) was injured on a rollout early in the second quarter. Junior 
James Nguyen did a credible job in Gondringer's absence, completing 11 of 22 
passes for 121 yards and two touchdowns.

HOOVER DEFENSE CLEANS UP, 17-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoover High held La Canada to just 88 yards total offense and turned two 
third-quarter turnovers into 10 points to claim a 17-12 victory in a nonleague 
game Thursday night at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our run defense has played well all year," Coach Dennis Hughes said."We felt 
if we could make them pass, it would be to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hoover (2-3) trailing, 12-7, early in the third quarter, Henrik Stepanyan 
intercepted a pass by James Wolstenholme and returned it 22 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 On La Canada's next play from scrimmage, Hoover recovered a Ray Lee fumble on 
the La Canada 22-yard-line and scored four plays later when Jack Vartanyan 
kicked a 33-yard field goal for a 17-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With La Canada (2-3) moving the ball late in the fourth quarter, defensive end 
Steve Staub recorded one of his two sacks of Wolstenholme. Two plays later, 
Staub sealed the victory when he trapped Lee for an eight-yard loss on fourth 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one's really sweet," Hughes said. "It's nice to beat those guys who are 
just over the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada scored the game's first points on a 12-yard run by Lee with five 
minutes to play in the first quarter. Lee finished with 24 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans scored again three minutes later when Hoover quarterback Juan 
Marin was hit and fumbled. Kyle McGregor recovered and raced 66 yards for a 
touchdown that gave La Canada a 12-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin completed five of 14 passes for 76 yards and one touchdown.

JACKSON'S RUNS RESCUE MONTCLAIR PREP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when it appeared that Montclair Prep was down and out Thursday night, 
Siggy Jackson came to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep's starting quarterback, Bobby Neumann, and its starting running 
back, Demetris Green, had been knocked out of the game with injuries.But 
Jackson responded with two fourth-quarter touchdown runs to rally the Mounties 
to a 20-7 nonleague victory over Gladstone at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep (4-1) trailed, 7-6, when Jackson, who rushed for 86 yards in 16 
carries, capped a 67-yard drive with a four-yard touchdown with six minutes to 
play. He added another four-yard touchdown in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Green had rushed for 158 yards in 15 carries until he injured his left knee 
late in the third quarter. Akil Anderson, the Mounties' other running back, did 
not play because of an injured knee. Neumann left with a concussion late in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Anderson, the four Montclair Prep players suspended last 
week in connection with a hazing incident were reinstated and played.

COSTA MESA KEEPS RUNNING, POUNDS SAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa rushed its point, actually 63 of them, across to Santa Ana in a 
63-20 victory in a nonleague football game Thursday at Newport Harbor High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (4-1) ran for 493 yards and had 532 yards in total offense in the 
final game before Pacific Coast League play starts next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Chatman, Orange County's leading rusher, had another standout night. 
He ran for 254 yards in 15 carries (16.9 yards per carry) and scored three 
touchdowns. He scored on a 45-yard touchdown run on his first carry. He also 
scored on runs of 29 and 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman, working behind an offensive line that moved Santa Ana off the ball on 
most plays, has 1,100 yards in 115 carries at the halfway point of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWayne Crenshaw added 132 yards in 21 carries for Costa Mesa, the 
fifth-ranked team in Division VIII. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw scored on a 20-yard touchdown run with 8 minutes 7 seconds left in 
the first quarter to put Costa Mesa ahead 14-0. It was the Mustangs' second 
touchdown in 34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Taylor, Costa Mesa's quarterback, scored on runs of six and two yards and 
Pat McBride, normally an offensive lineman, moved into the backfield to score 
twice as well. His runs were six and seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although overmatched, Santa Ana (0-5) showed life with its passing game. 
Quarterback Brian Schwalm threw for 185 yards and three touchdowns. He 
completed touchdown passes of 76 and 45 yards to Carlos Rodriguez. Schwalm also 
threw a three-yard scoring pass to Omar Gomez in the closing seconds.

SAILORS TAKE CARE OF SAVANNA STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Savanna Rebels had done many things to many teams the last 1 1/2 seasons, 
but one thing they've not had to do often is come from behind to win. 
</P>
<P>
 They were unsuccessful Thursday night. In front of about 500 at Glover 
Stadium, the previously unbeaten Rebels were stymied, stood up and ultimately 
stopped by still-unbeaten Newport Harbor, 22-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailors' fullback Brian Johnson took the opening kickoff 94 yards for a 
touchdown and after that, the Sailors (5-0) used the grind-it-out running of 
Jeremy Mason (93 yards) and spot passing from John Giordani (79 yards) to keep 
the ball away from Savanna. The Rebels (4-1) had only three second-half 
possessions, one in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor defense shut down the Rebels, who had scored 181 points in 
four games this season and had won their last 10 coming in (the county's 
second-longest streak behind Los Alamitos). Their vaunted veer-T rushing attack 
could muster only 67 yards. Quarterback Jeremy Klemp passed for 113 yards, but 
a fourth-quarter interception by Johnson -- the third Savanna turnover -- was 
the last time the Rebels had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made too many mistakes, but give Newport Harbor the credit tonight," 
Savanna Coach Fred DiPalma said. "They were able to keep the ball and pound us. 
I'm not happy we lost, but there's another game next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley worried about Savanna's speed -- "In Orange 
County, especially Division V, you don't see that much speed. You get out of 
position and they're gone," he said -- and figured a ball-control game was the 
way to beat the Sailors. But he had to do so a man short, because running back 
Edon Kagasoff was sidelined by a deep thigh bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson made sure he wasn't needed. He caught the kickoff at his six-yard 
line, broke through the wedge at the 35, and ran untouched the remaining 65 
yards for the touchdown. Savanna was shocked further when it fumbled while 
attempting to punt and the Sailors recovered on the Rebels' 16. Three plays 
later, Mason punched in from the one. Dan McDonough had a two-point run. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport seemed poised to deliver a quick knockout blow when they forced 
Savanna to punt again. But this time, the Sailors fumbled at their 35, and 
Savanna recovered. Klemp -- who was eight for 10 for 90 yards in the first half 
-- made the visitors pay with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Daven King. A 
two-point run failed.

CERRITOS BEATS BRETHREN CHRISTIAN WITH LAST-MINUTE PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MADDY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ryan Matthews connected with Dan Salazar on a 14-yard touchdown pass with 23 
seconds left, giving Cerritos a 21-15 victory over Brethren Christian Thursday 
at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian led, 15-13, at halftime and managed to hold that lead for 
most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos turned the ball over on four of its first five second-half 
possessions and had three gains of 20-plus yards nullified by penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian converted on fourth and one at its 42 with 2 minutes 18 
seconds remaining and needed only to run out the clock. However, John Dingman 
fumbled on the next play, and the ball was recovered by Cerritos linebacker 
Scott Biehn at the Warrior 35. Matthews led Cerritos downfield and capped the 
drive with a bizarre scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews overthrew Salazar at the goal line and the pass was batted down by 
Brethren Christian defender Ryan Babcock, but Salazar reached down and caught 
the deflected ball, falling into the end zone. Cerritos added a two-point 
conversion for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian held the lead at the half, thanks to a 10-play drive that 
ended in a Babcock-to-Kevin Cooper 15-yard touchdown pass with 9:50 remaining 
in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors were fortunate on the conversion. Kicker Dan Harney fielded a bad 
snap, rolled out, and passed to Dan Muilenberg for the two-point conversion and 
a 15-7 lead. ERIC MADDY

SIDELINES; CANDY MAN SWEETENS THE POT FOR CAL LUTHERAN FOOTBALL FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, Karsen Lundring brought candy left over from an office party 
to a Cal Lutheran football game. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan was to distribute the sweets among friends and fans. Then, in the 
excitement of a touchdown, he started tossing it. A tradition was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundring, a 52-year-old financial planner and Cal Lutheran graduate, brings 
$50 worth of assorted candy to football games, throwing handfuls after every 
Kingsmen touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And, since his son Erik started playing defensive end for Cal Lutheran, 
Lundring sometimes doesn't even wait for a score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when the defense makes a big play, I throw a little," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbal volleys: Fingers have been pointing and tongues wagging ever since 
Valley defeated Hancock, 36-25, Saturday in a Western State Conference football 
game in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Coach Jim Fenwick is miffed that Hancock Coach Barney Eames ordered his 
players not to shake hands after the game. Eames is ticked at Fenwick because 
he claims Valley players were "talking smack on every freaking play." 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick responded by saying that what Eames was really miffed about was that 
Valley had varied its snap count, drawing Hancock players offside seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 Eames gave Fenwick an earful after the game, but the Valley coach claims his 
adversary is blasting him without ammunition. "There was not one 
unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty called in the game," Fenwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Really? What about after the game? 
</P>
<P>
 Handyman: Making his first start at quarterback for Calabasas High last week, 
Zak Lovenson completed his first nine passes. Then, on the last play of the 
first half, Lovenson suffered a broken right thumb while making a handoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he can't throw with a fractured thumb, Lovenson will start at wide 
receiver tonight against St. Monica. He also will be the long snapper on 
special teams, hiking the ball with his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The long run: Moorpark High Coach Rob Dearborn is caught in a pleasant 
dilemma. Tyler Dritz, the quarterback who last season guided the Musketeers to 
a Frontier League title, has recovered from a shoulder injury. But Bryan Paul, 
who has completed 25 of 54 passes for 491 yards, has guided the team to a 4-0 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz, whose father is Moorpark's principal (and Dearborn's boss), has been 
playing wide receiver, where his contributions have been significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not totally happy," Dearborn said, "but he's making the big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he ever. Dritz has scored touchdowns on a 75-yard kick return, a 66-yard 
run and two fumble recoveries. On another play, Dritz stripped the ball from a 
runner and bolted 80 yards for a score that was called back. 
</P>
<P>
 Boldface: The Van Nuys High girls' volleyball team was sporting intimidating, 
new black uniforms for Wednesday's Valley Pac-8 Conference showdown against 
previously undefeated Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting for these for two years," senior Connie Chae said. "We've 
always wanted the black uniforms." Like Van Nuys needed help. The reigning 
two-time City Section 3-A Division champions won easily, 15-6, 15-1, 15-0. 
Stats 
</P>
<P>
 The Highland High football team has won consecutive games for the first time 
in 16 games, a run of success that prompted Coach Lin Parker to fully commit to 
a newly installed passing offense. "Now we're changing our junior varsity and 
freshman offenses from the I formation to the (pass-oriented) one-back offense 
in the middle of the season," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trendsetter: When Kennedy High's Waking Bailey intercepts more than one pass, 
the Golden Cougars win. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Bailey's six interceptions came in victories over Inglewood and North 
Hollywood. He had one interception in a loss to Sylmar and last week, against 
pass-happy Granada Hills, Bailey was shut out. Kennedy lost, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Knights: How good is the Notre Dame High defense? Ask Royal's Jerome Lee. 
In Royal's three victories, Lee rushed for, in order, 94, 185 and 116 yards. 
The Knights held him to 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Grounded: Since being called up from the junior varsity, replacing the injured 
Randy Iaccino, St. Genevieve quarterback Vince Pisano has completed 39 of 66 
for 418 yards and a touchdown. However, he also has thrown 10 interceptions -- 
including seven last week in a 21-6 loss to Daniel Murphy. That's one shy of 
the Southern Section record for most interceptions in a game by a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubling up: The Cal State Northridge football team rushed for 286 yards last 
week against Cal State Chico -- 12 more than it had in its first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Big foot: Cal Lutheran's Jeff Shea, second in the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with an average of 41.5 yards a kick, had 
punts of 60 and 62 yards last week against Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading places: Since switching positions two weeks ago, Burroughs quarterback 
Scott Boldvich has completed 22 of 41 for 282 yards and four touchdowns, and 
receiver Mike Barrett has seven receptions for 117 yards and two touchdowns. 
Things to Do 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 3:15 p.m., at the Agoura High swimming pool: Royal puts its 66-match 
Marmonte League water polo winning streak on the line against Agoura, which 
defeated the Highlanders, 16-7, last week in a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, 7, North Campus Stadium: Cal State Northridge (6-3) will play host to 
San Diego State (6-4) in a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation men's soccer 
opener. The Matadors are also home Sunday, at 6 p.m. against Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose both (games) and it's death," Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad said. 
"We lose one and it's not too good."

PENSKE TRIO SHOULD AGAIN DOMINATE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 PPG Indy Car season concludes this weekend with the Toyota Grand Prix 
of Monterey at Laguna Seca Raceway, but there is little reason to expect 
anything more than the usual parade of red and white Penskes out in front 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five times the Team Penske trio of Al Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul 
Tracy has finished 1-2-3 this season. They have qualified 1-2-3 on three 
occasions and in the standings, Unser and Fittipaldi have clinched first and 
second and Tracy is solidly in third. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Penske has won 11 of 15 races and its drivers have led 1,500 laps of the 
1,999 run this season. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tracy won last year's race here, leading 81 of the 84 laps around the 
picturesque 2.214-mile hillside circuit with its 11 turns. The three other laps 
were led by Fittipaldi, the pole sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 So the most exciting moment -- certainly the most emotional -- might occur 
after the race is over, when Mario Andretti takes a final tour of Laguna Seca 
in a pace car painted "Mario Andretti red" for a final salute to his fans after 
31 years of racing. He is retiring from Indy cars after Sunday's Bank of 
America 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "For sure, it will be emotional," Andretti said. "I just hope we can have a 
good day. It would be great to make the podium (for a top three finish), but I 
would love to be running at the finish. I want to be on the track for the 
checkered flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti has a record three poles in 11 Indy car races at Laguna Seca, but 
surprisingly, among his 52 victories none has been here. He has been second 
three times, once to his son Michael in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti returned to Indy cars this season and raced against his 
father, but not as his teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the track, the younger Andretti's bid to break up the Penske combine is 
about the only drama left. He has two victories -- at Australia and Toronto -- 
this season and is 12 points behind Tracy for third place and 14 ahead of Robby 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, the off-roader from Orange, is still looking for his first Indy car 
victory, although he has been on the pole twice this season, has led races and 
finished a strong second in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying will begin today and continue Saturday. The main event is Sunday at 
1 p.m.

SEE DICK, SEE JANE, SEE SPOT RUN AGAIN; FULLERTON LIBRARY EXHIBIT PROVIDES A 
RARE OPPORTUNITY TO GET REACQUAINTED WITH OUR CHILDHOOD FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure, there's Kukla, Fran and Ollie; Hopalong; Annette, and the Beav. If 
you're a baby boomer, those names are guaranteed to conjure up pleas ant 
childhood memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Dick and Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing quite evokes those simple, carefree days of youth as much as the young 
brother and sister who helped teach several generations of Americans to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown-haired Dick, the older brother, often wore short pants and a striped 
T-shirt. His sister Jane had golden brown hair and wore a little school dress 
that tied in the back with a bow. Then there was baby sister Sally, all blond 
curls and a button nose, who always had her teddy bear Tim in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 And let's don't forget the children's playful kitten Puff and their legendary 
dog Spot. 
</P>
<P>
 They all lived in a mystically happy town that was all white picket fences and 
friendly faces: Clean. Wholesome. Comfortably middle class. It was a 
traditional white America kind of place where Dad went to work, Mom stayed 
home, and the kids played. Oh, how they played. 
</P>
<P>
 See Dick. See Dick run. See Jane. See Jane run. See Puff play with the ball. 
See Spot jump. 
</P>
<P>
 If you learned to read with Dick and Jane, it's doubtful they've strayed too 
far from memory. But the Fullerton Public Library is providing a golden 
opportunity to get reacquainted with those kids with the penchant for 
one-syllable words. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday and running through Dec. 10, "The Story of Dick and Jane" 
will chronicle the publishing history and cultural impact of the classic 
learn-to-read series that came under attack in the '60s when minority groups 
complained that they were too ethnocentric and women's groups accused them of 
sex stereotyping.  
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit includes dozens of books and representative blowups of color 
illustrations spanning the 35 years "Dick and Jane" books were published. 
Because the books were updated every decade, the illustrations reflect the 
dramatic changes in American life -- from wringer washing machines and cars 
with running boards to TVs and tail fins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the display will be greeted by life-sized cutouts of Dick, Jane 
and Sally accompanied by -- natch -- a white picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, sponsored by the Friends of the Fullerton Public Library, is on 
loan from the Richmond, Va., Public Library, where it was a hit earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia, needless to say, will be running high at the library over the next 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just millions and millions of children -- now adults -- who learned 
to read with those books," said Carolyn Eckert, the library's manager of 
children's services and herself a 1940s Dick and Jane alum. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert said that when she announced the exhibit during a Fullerton School 
District principals' meeting, it touched off a round of reminiscences and 
laughter: "I was really amazed at what kind of a button that pushed for them, 
so it's a really intrinsic part of childhood for a lot of people out there, and 
I'm surprised how much of an emotional grab it has for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Created by reading consultant Zerna Sharp for Scott, Foresman and Co., a 
Glenview, Ill., textbook publisher, the "Dick and Jane" series was introduced 
nearly 65 years ago as an alternative to the phonics method of teaching 
children to read. It uses the "look-say" method, in which simple words are 
repeated over and over until they are learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick and Jane," the first title published in 1930, is a pre-primer: the 
simplest of introductory readers. "Fun with Dick and Jane" -- a primer offering 
basic story lines with longer sentences and more vocabulary -- arrived in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1930 and 1965, 56 different "Dick and Jane" readers were published, in 
addition to "Dick and Jane" health and personal development books, activity 
work books (the "Think and Do" books) and teachers editions. 
</P>
<P>
 There was even a Roman Catholic edition, which included religious references 
in the pictures such as a nun playing the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1960, an estimated 85% of American school systems were using the books. 
They also were used in Canada, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and on 
U.S. military bases around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would compare it in its time to the McGuffey Reader series of the 19th 
Century," said Carolyn Johnson, retired Fullerton Public Library director and 
an authority on children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who helped set up the exhibit, said the concept of reading was 
introduced in the pre-primer. The children would be shown "running, riding 
tricycles, doing something and they would say something like, 'Look, look. See 
Dick run.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adults may laugh at the simplicity of the introductory books, "but the 
children loved the stories," said Vi Johnson, a retired Fullerton first-grade 
teacher who began using "Dick and Jane" in her classroom in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 In one story, baby Sally holds her teddy bear up to a drinking fountain, and 
when the bear's nose gets too close to the fountain, she squirts her brother 
and sister. Such gentle humor was common. "It was things the children could 
identify with," Vi Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The characters epitomized an idealized vision of American middle-class family 
life and, to keep the characters as mainstream as possible, even their clothes 
were patterned after those found in Sears catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 When the books came under attack from women's and minority groups, the 
publisher countered with a multiethnic edition in 1965. But the new version did 
not catch on, and that marked the end of the line for Dick and Jane: There were 
no more new editions. Besides, they had outlived their usefulness, said Carolyn 
Johnson, "and the look-say method was no longer in favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the older "Dick and Jane" editions gradually disappeared from school 
curricula, they haven't vanished. Reprints of the 1956 edition are still used 
in several hundred Amish and Old Order Mennonite schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, however, the books have continued to loom large in the 
memories of those who were introduced to Dick and Jane in first grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for an exhibit originated with the Friends of the Richmond Public 
Library as a way to call attention to the library's rare children's book 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick and Jane became an obvious possibility," Elena Siddall, a board member 
of the Friends, explained by phone from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, however, didn't own a single Dick and Jane book, and when a call 
for the books went out on the Friends' newsletter, only a couple of copies 
turned up.  
</P>
<P>
 But word of mouth got more books trickling in from people throughout the 
community who raided their attics and basements. The library ended up with more 
than 100 "Dick and Jane" books spanning the decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't the end of it. Caught up in the nostalgia of it all, Richmond 
residents also donated vintage school pictures, report cards and toys for the 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opened in February, the exhibit was such a hit that its original 
one-month run was extended to three and 8,000 visitors turned out to renew 
their acquaintance with Dick and Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddall believes the characters were universally popular because they were the 
same age as the children reading them: "They were easy to identify with as far 
as their activities -- as far as middle-class America certainly." 
</P>
<P>
 But others view the characters in less rosy terms. The Virginia exhibit 
included a comment/memory book in which visitors could jot down their thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This comment book is just priceless," Siddall said. "It's the breadth of all 
the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sampler: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dick and Jane are old friends. What a delight to renew acquaintances." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Even at 6 or 7, I somehow felt Dick and Jane didn't live in the real 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 * "This exhibit has taken me back to a time when equality for not only the 
sexes but also the races was clearly not in the picture. . . . Praise God for 
the memories, thank God these books are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Look-Say method of teaching reading is a fraud. . . . Instead of having 
an exhibit on the poor whole-word method which is dishonest, you should show a 
little respect to the only method that can or ever did, or ever will work -- 
strictly phonics." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dick and Jane are the childhood of a few generations of Americans. Even if 
it was bad, insipid stuff, we love it because it was." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Our kids deserve better than the idealistic lily-white Eurocentricity of 
the past. Children of all genders and races deserve a more balanced reflection 
of today's society." 
</P>
<P>
 * "How white can you get?" 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit at the Fullerton Public Library will have a similar guest book to 
record visitor comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can give us some of their memories or castigate it. It's up to them," 
Carolyn Johnson said. "I think in reliving the mid-century, this is an 
important part of the educational picture and therefore of America. It's part 
of our cultural history."

FIRST PERSON: SHE GETS ALONG SWIMMINGLY DESPITE TRIATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If you can run, bike and swim, you can be a triathlete," the article 
promised. "Follow our 12-week training program and cross the finish line, 
guaranteed!" 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a good excuse to exercise, I was hooked before I finished reading 
about "mini" or sprint triathlons -- a half-mile swim, a 13-mile bike ride and 
a three-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, I can shuffle along for a few miles, I thought, even though I've never 
been much of a runner. And I love biking. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was the matter of The Swim. 
</P>
<P>
 I never learned to swim growing up in New Jersey because there was really no 
place to swim. Only one kid in my neighborhood had a pool, but it was the 
above-ground kind, maybe four feet deep -- I once skinned my forehead on a 
clothes line while leaping off the side. And my parents rarely braved the 
bumper-to-bumper traffic to get to the Jersey shore. 
</P>
<P>
 But I blame my swimming fears on Steven Spielberg. Ever since "Jaws," I 
couldn't go near the water without watching for fins accompanied by menacing 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I moved to Southern California that I realized what I was 
missing: snorkeling off Laguna Beach, bay kayaking in Long Beach or spending a 
Friday night aboard the Muckraker, a fellow journalist's rig. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured it was time to conquer my paralyzing fear. I began following my 
run-bike training program ( never call it exercise). That first weekend I went 
down to the Alamitos Bay, convinced I could teach myself to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised the water was so clear and warm. I looked down to see -- fish! 
</P>
<P>
 I sprinted back to the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 I willed myself back in, cringing, trying not to think about sharks as I 
attempted a freestyle stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, there came a voice: "You must be taking swimming lessons," said a 
girl in pigtails. I was astonished a little tyke could tread water so 
effortlessly. Then I realized I had drifted so close to shore I could kneel and 
still keep my head above water. I stood up and slinked away. 
</P>
<P>
 I signed up for private swim lessons with an instructor who stood slack-jawed 
when I explained I wanted to complete a triathlon, now just a few weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd better start with survival techniques," she said. My lessons were in 
four-foot-deep water. First came treading water and the backstroke. Freestyle 
swimming followed, but I had trouble alternating strokes with gulps for air. 
</P>
<P>
 My instructor would walk beside me, chanting: "You're swimming, you're 
swimming, BREATHE! You're swimming, you're swimming, BREATHE!" 
</P>
<P>
 I trained hard and was giddy at my improvements. I began enjoying my pool 
workouts, which were remarkably calming. Even in a crowded pool, the quiet 
afforded by my earplugs and my red swim cap made me feel alone. I learned to 
trust the buoyant water and overcame my dislike of goggles, which allowed me to 
follow the soothing blue lane lines at the bottom of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Within just a few weeks, I could swim a half-mile. At my last swim lesson, my 
instructor urged me to postpone my triathlon plans until I spent more time -- 
actually, any time -- in the ocean, because the swim would be disorienting. 
</P>
<P>
 But I had convinced myself I would be fine. I recklessly waited until the day 
of the event to take my first ocean swim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I entered a Danskin triathlon because it caters to first-timers and is just 
for women. The swim took place at the calm waters of the Newport Dunes, and the 
bike and run course covered flat land around scenic Back Bay Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 I had two goals. One: Don't drown. Two: Don't finish last. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 a.m. on Sept. 11, I felt calm as I stood at the edge of the water, 
surrounded by hundreds of women of all ages and sizes. The men stood behind the 
starting line, yelling words of support and waving hand-made signs. 
</P>
<P>
 A whistle blew and my "wave" -- swimmers grouped by age and ability -- went 
rushing forward. I was astonished by my reaction as warm water enveloped me. 
</P>
<P>
 I was shocked by the sting and taste of the salt, and when I forced my face 
into the water, all I could see was pea-soup green. 
</P>
<P>
 I started panting wildly, unable to breathe normally, feeling the seeming 
crush of the water about my chest. I felt strangled and began to cry. 
Panicking, I tried turning back but was overcome by a second wave of women who 
simply swam over me. I was battered by the swinging arms and kicking legs that 
kept forcing me under the water. 
</P>
<P>
 I found myself facing the ocean again. Inexplicably, I began a frantic doggie 
paddle forward. In my distress, I began gulping salt water. I kept bobbing 
downward, irrationally trying to somehow stand in the deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew I was near drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried swimming across the oncoming path of women to reach land on the other 
side of the small lagoon but was knocked back again and again. One blow ripped 
off my goggles. I was desperately looking for a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I remembered my first lesson and flipped on my back and started 
kicking. But I forgot to use my arms. I was nearing the end when I finally came 
up behind a lifeguard kneeling atop a paddleboard in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, please," I gasped for help. But he was yelling: "Come on, ladies! 
You're almost there! You're about to become triathletes!" 
</P>
<P>
 I struggled to keep going, alternating between scrambling like a dog and 
kicking furiously on my back. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few women remained in the water, one alongside me as I neared the 
shore. "Please tell me when I can stand," I begged her. 
</P>
<P>
 I emerged wobbly and began sobbing. Only a few people remained at the finish 
line. I headed for my car; I was quitting. Then I looked at my watch. Stunned, 
I saw it read just over 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 My best time ever, even though it was my first ocean swim. 
</P>
<P>
 I went into a portable bathroom and threw up my breakfast. I was still dazed 
as I yanked on my bike shorts and strapped on my helmet, the only woman 
remaining in the transition area. 
</P>
<P>
 I never really recovered. The bike should have taken 50 minutes, but took 75. 
I was still shaking when I set out for the run. About a mile from the finish, I 
fell and split open my right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 As I limped across the finish line, a volunteer strung a purple medal around 
my neck -- a souvenir for all finishers. I headed for the first-aid stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Wincing as the attendant cleaned my wound, I smiled feebly as the announcer 
read off the names of other women who managed to be slower. My time was about 
2:15. The winner finished in under an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 I swore afterward I'd hang up my goggles for good. But I enjoyed the training 
program regimen and kept reminding myself the swim was my best event. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I need some more swimming lessons -- ocean swimming lessons -- and a 
new goal. 
</P>
<P>
 I was reading an article about a popular "half" triathlon being held in Hawaii 
next fall. If I start training now, I could handle the 50-mile bike ride and 
the 13-mile run. And the one-mile swim.

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; DISNEYLAND IS TOO MICKEY MOUSE FOR 
FAMILY GUIDE

 "To different minds the same world is a hell, and a heaven."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Ralph Waldo Emerson 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every day this summer, thousands of tourists flooded into Disneyland as the 
gates opened. All too often, my relatives from Taiwan and I were among them. 
</P>
<P>
 My Taiwanese relatives have always thought that Disneyland was California's 
main attraction. When they go, they stare at everything, afraid that once they 
get home they will forget even a single popcorn stand. They savor every 
experience -- including the taste of their hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 What it means for me is that I know every ride, every restaurant, every tree. 
I have almost memorized the menus at the Lunching Pad. Disneyland bores me, and 
I would rather walk the street in a woman's dress than go again. 
</P>
<P>
 My relatives especially love the rides, and our first stop is always the 
Pirates of the Caribbean. The special effects with houses burning, cannons 
roaring, pirates singing and women-chasing pirates amuse and entertain them. I, 
on the other hand, think that the whole place has horrible props. A friend once 
used a fake claw toy to grab a pearl necklace; the pearls were cracked and felt 
as light as tiny Ping-Pong balls. And even my little brother knows that the 
"fire" is only light shinning on a special fabric and blown with a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sure stop is the infamous Space Mountain. After my relatives take 
their 30-second trip through the pitch-black "mountain," they talk for 30 
minutes about what a great ride it was. They say things like, "Those falls sure 
were fun," and "I didn't hold the bar for the whole ride." But compared to 
Magic Mountain's Viper and Free Fall, Space Mountain feels like a ride on a 
flat-tired bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 As if the rides weren't torture enough, I then have to take my aunts and 
cousins to the Lunching Pad for a bite to eat. Even a freshman knows that $2.89 
for a Jupiter Dog -- nothing more than a quarter-pound hot dog on a stale bun 
-- is a rip-off. Even though the Space Station -- an ordinary hamburger -- 
costs a fortune, it's still worse than junior high school cafeteria food. The 
lettuce is dry and brown, and the pickles are so flexible that after I roll 
them into little balls, they still return to their original shape. My 
relatives, of course, love it. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning to digest our food in a long line, we head toward Splash Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in line, we wait and wait. After an hour, we have finally reached the 
stand that sells apples and bottled water. After another arduous wait, we have 
the privilege of taking a seat in a plastic log. My 9-year-old cousin adores 
the animated robots designed to look like small animals. I love them, too. I 
love the thought of pouring water on them to short-circuit them. 
</P>
<P>
 After traveling through the disenchanting forest, we finally reach the high 
point. The fall ends before I realize that it has started. I never even get 
wet, which, judging from the name, is the intention of the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the afternoon comes the inevitable shopping. Nothing against my 
cousins, but I hate to shop with them. They are always buying T-shirts, towels 
and postcards. Worse yet, they are mostly girls. They crowd around the shelves 
that display the stuffed animals and say, "Look at that Mickey Mouse. He's so 
cute!" When the ordeal is over, I carry their bags. Since I am allergic to the 
fibers in the stuffed animals, I spend the next few hours sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as my nose is recovering, my cousins ask to see the Main Street 
Electrical Parade. In the dark of night, everything looks beautiful to them. 
When the butterfly or the caterpillar wiggles by, my cousins shriek and laugh. 
I, not wanting to be blinded by the lights, close my eyes. The dancers with 
light bulb necklaces shimmy by, and my cousins grab me and chatter about how 
exotic they look. I tell them that the only thing that will interest me is if 
someone gets electrocuted. 
</P>
<P>
 When my relatives have finally sucked the Disneyland experience dry, we head 
toward the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, my aunt asks, "Where did we park our car?" My smallest cousin 
says, "I think we parked in Sleepy. Or was it Donald? Maybe Goofy." So we sit 
on a bench until most of the people leave. Then we roam the rows, trudging on 
and on until finally we see the Honda. To me, it is a beautiful sight. 
</P>
<P>
 It is my escape vehicle from the happiest place on earth.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; A FRENCH CONNECTION; EDUCATION: LANGUAGE 
IMMERSION WAS THE GOAL, BUT SEVEN TEEN-AGERS ALSO GOT A TASTE OF INDEPENDENCE 
AND INTERNATIONAL LIVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE CARPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Laurie Carper is a senior at Sunny 
Hills High School in Fullerton.

<P>
 Learning to speak French was the goal, but spending a summer in France 
provided more than a language education for seven Orange County teen-agers who 
attended Lycee Paul Valery, a three-week summer school in Menton, France. 
</P>
<P>
 While tasting independence and negotiating the French language, we became 
locals in an international school atmosphere. Menton, a border town on the 
French Riviera, is only 10 minutes by train to Italy. The school's location 
makes it ideal for international exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Language immersion classes filled the mornings, leaving the afternoons free to 
explore the Matisse and Chagall museums in Nice, the Jacques Cousteau Aquarium 
in Monaco and the tiny medieval-looking town of St. Paul de Vence. We had time 
to sample hazelnut ice cream, to skip down Monaco's petunia-lined streets and 
relax on a pebble beach watching fireworks explode and float down into the 
Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Since curfew at the school was 2:30 a.m. on weekdays and 4:30 a.m. on 
weekends, the local discotheque beckoned. There was dancing -- the music 
alternated between techno and American tunes -- romance and a smoke-filled 
environment. "For us, the curfew seemed like it was really late, but it's not 
for French people. Things start at midnight," said Costa Mesa High School 
senior Susan Channels. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity for the Orange County students to attend the school and taste 
the culture came about after Sunny Hills High School French teacher Lynn 
Johnson met the French school's director, Gerard Poulet, while team-writing the 
new International Baccalaureate French exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew that I was looking for a French summer school to send students to and 
it was just kind of out of the blue that he offered his school," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-week tour of England and France with 23 other high school students 
who were part of the International Study Tours program, seven of us chose to 
further our studies at Lycee Paul Valery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We took the bullet train to the south of France and the school, where we were 
the only Americans enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really intimidated by the people at first," said Sunny Hills High 
School junior Katie Tucker. "I thought everyone knew more French than I did. I 
found that that wasn't the case. There were all levels and everyone was pretty 
friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1967, the school offers two summer sessions, each lasting three 
weeks. It is for students 16 and older. Most of those in attendance with us 
were in their 20s. Second-session enrollment totaled 70 students and 
represented 10 nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The originality of the school is that we combine a serious, intensive course 
in the morning with a definite holiday outlook in the evening," said Poulet, 
who teaches French during the year at the University of Exeter in England. 
"Because we're small, we know everybody and there is a relaxed spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 On campus, four students of different nationalities shared a two-room suite. 
Meals were served in a central cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes ran from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. The school day 
began when Poulet clapped his hands three times each morning and hollered, "La 
joie par le travail," meaning "Work brings joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Students were placed in one of four class levels: beginner, elementary, 
intermediate or advanced, according to written and oral tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most clientele are people who had French in school, but didn't learn how to 
communicate," said Etienne Andre, a professor and native of Menton. "Our goal 
is to develop the speaking ability by teaching grammar, vocabulary and idioms." 
</P>
<P>
 "Class wasn't what I expected," said Jessica Johnson, a junior from Sunny 
Hills High School. "We worked on verbs and played murder mystery games -- all 
in French. Everyone actively participated and learned lots of new vocabulary 
relating to how the victim died; not that we'll use those words, but it helped 
to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Time outside of class was "adventure time." One Friday afternoon, the group 
took the train to Vintimille, a border town in Italy. The open market buzzed 
with activity, resembling a swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of us, the true quest was food. The gelato tasted yummy, but pizza 
took a while to find. Restaurants close in the afternoon. We finally asked a 
waitress in French for pizza to go, but she had to round up an English 
translator to understand us. 
</P>
<P>
 After 35 minutes, it still had not arrived because the waitress had forgotten 
to pick up our order. We finally got our pizza, but missed the early train back 
to Menton. We sat outside the station and ate our mushroom and cheese pizza 
while waiting for the next train. 
</P>
<P>
 We took beach excursions, hiked to the Fragonard perfumery and went shopping 
in the old village. There were spirited volleyball and Ping-Pong tournaments, 
water-skiing on the Mediterranean and attempts at making giant crepes with a 
Belgian friend on the school's industrial-size kitchen stove. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff gave us a lot of freedom and I think we handled it really well," 
said Melissa Birkholz, also from Sunny Hills. "My parents trust me more now." 
</P>
<P>
 The weeks passed quickly. At the end of the session, the mayor of Menton 
hosted a formal diploma ceremony at the town hall to commend the students' 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The students who absorbed the most French during the session tended to have 
the highest comfort levels, both with the language and with being away from 
home in a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the experience, Sunny Hills student Ann Kim said she felt older 
students might fare better. "I'd recommend Menton to someone who's older, at 
least 18. You need someone who's willing to speak French and try new frontiers, 
the person who is the brave traveler," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the Sunny Hills teacher who set things in motion, said she is anxious 
to see how what the students learned translates into the classroom this year. 
"This experience melds everything they've learned. Learning a language is 
always a struggle in class, but when you're set in a real-life situation, it 
all comes together in a way that's phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 As for personal growth, Los Alamitos High School junior Michelle French said: 
"I learned a lot about myself and how I judge people. I learned how to take 
care of others and myself. I'd love to go back."

 An Ohio mother who says she was coping with a rebellious 16-year-old daughter 
decided to tape the girl's telephone calls, an action that landed her in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mother won't face trial.A felony wiretapping charge was dropped 
against Judy Weising, who said she shouldn't have been charged in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has always been a very good girl," the mom said of her daughter. "But 
then she changed her friends and skipped school. Her attitude also changed and 
her grades dropped a little bit. . . . I had to see what was happening in her 
life." So she tapped the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's father, who had recently filed for divorce, was the one who found 
the equipment and took it to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge at a pretrial hearing said he was opposed to government interference 
in family rearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother admits she invaded her daughter's privacy. "But I still feel your 
parental responsibilities supersede your child's rights in certain instances," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter said she had no bone to pick with her mother and understood what 
drove her mom to such action. Required Computers? 
</P>
<P>
 First-year students at three California state universities may have to own a 
personal computer, which one campus official says is as essential as the slide 
rule of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools -- Sonoma State, Humboldt State and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo -- 
have asked the chancellor of the 20-university state system for permission to 
adopt the requirement in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of a PC ranges from $1,300 to $2,700 for an updated laptop or desk 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cost, some private schools and a few public universities have 
already instituted the requirement.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW: BILL WALSH COLLEGE FOOTBALL, FOR GENESIS FROM ELECTRONIC 
ARTS, $65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM SCHIFFMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Are you ready for some football? 
</P>
<P>
 With both the pros and colleges back on the gridiron, it's time for gamers to 
check out the latest in 16-bit pigskin play. 
</P>
<P>
 If you favor the pro game, Williams Entertainment offers Troy Aikman NFL 
Football for Sega Genesis and other systems. College fans will want to check 
out Bill Walsh College Football '95 ($64.99 for Genesis from Electronic Arts). 
</P>
<P>
 I'll give each one a touchdown, but no extra point -- good try, needs fine 
tuning. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman is a great ballplayer, and it makes sense to star him in his own game, 
even if those of us who favor the San Francisco 49ers don't wish him well. But 
Aikman's talents don't guarantee a great game; there is some bad and some ugly 
to go with much good. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman is loaded with neat features -- adjustable difficulty, five play modes, 
battery storage of season stats, changeable field conditions and even the 
ability to "buy" a better team by paying your players more to motivate them to 
play better. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the usual zillion plays, although the little drawings are especially 
hard to see. You can also create your own plays, if you think you're smarter 
than Troy, and play the entire 1993-1994 season in your living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Controls in this one- or two-player game work well and plays seem to come off 
pretty much as they are diagramed. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawbacks? You're not playing with real players; nobody has a name. Sound 
effects and background voices are muddy and detract from the contest. And 
graphics are definitely not up to the best; they are fuzzy, and the colors are 
bland and uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aikman brings a real pro feel to your fingertips and, if you can live with 
the less-than-dazzling graphics, you, too, can go to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bill Walsh left my beloved 49ers, we fans thought the end had come. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we were right, but college fans now have Walsh -- and EA Sports -- to 
thank for this excellent football cart. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the game provides 36 real teams, from Air Force to Wisconsin, to choose 
from. Yes, Walsh's charges at Stanford are included; arch-rival Cal is also 
available if you want to play The Big Game from your easy chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh offers a four-player option; in one scenario, you can play quarterback 
and a buddy can handle your receivers on offense while two other folks can 
handle the two defensive players closest to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The game offers an exhibition option for practice. Then, start a new season; 
the game compiles season stats for all the players, lets you choose field 
conditions (snow is fun) and view the schedule and matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 You call plays in the now-standard fashion, from a collection of boxes you can 
cycle through. Be quick; the clock is running, and it will cost you five yards 
if you don't get the ball off in time. Audibles are also available at the line 
of scrimmage. You can call a no-huddle offense, running the same play as the 
previous down. And the quarterback can ground the ball to stop the clock in 
those last-second scoring situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound needs help, but control is good, and graphics are excellent, full of 
color and detail. Aikman, take note. 
</P>
<P>
 Either game will give you a good chance to take the field without actually 
worrying about a broken leg or your next contract negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Just win, baby.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: 'PREMIER' RISES TO TOP OF SLEAZE BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a reporter in the '90s means chasing tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the only good thing about this week's grisly cult massacre in Cheiry, 
Switzerland, is that at least it's a temporary diversion for some of the 
sensation-driven media riveted to even the trivia of the Simpson-Goldman 
homicide case. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is the notorious "Premier Story," a 4-month-old syndicated tabloid 
series aired locally on KCOP-TV Channel 13, the station now boasting that its 
scrawny half-hour newscast at 10 p.m. -- halved from a low-rated hour -- is 
"finally, a newscast to fit your schedule." As if a nightly hour of news (about 
44 minutes when the commercials are subtracted) puts you on information 
overload. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Premier Story," finally a tabloid series to fit your schedule -- if 
you think Lee is buried in Grant's tomb. On some nights, it makes "Hard Copy" 
and "A Current Affair" look like "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Who wouldn't be for yanking TV from the O.J. Simpson courtroom if that would 
result in the erasure of such pernicious skulkers as "Premier Story" and its 
obnoxiously smug British host, Alison Holloway? 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, it wouldn't. They and their commando colleagues do their 
damage outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first encountered "Premier Story" on Channel 13, some time ago, one of 
its operatives was in its Los Angeles studio confidently swearing on a stack of 
Bibles that Los Angeles police had recovered a ski mask outside the Brentwood 
townhouse of Nicole Brown Simpson. As we now know, the ski mask turned out to 
be a ski cap . 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, coverage of the Simpson-Goldman case has not been a golden moment for 
even the media who regard themselves as being holier than thou. Yet "Premier 
Story" plays at it like a game. During one recent week, the show recruited a 
young schnook named Joe -- a sort of tabloider in training -- to roam the 
exterior of the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building with a camera person and 
generally harass and bait anyone he could find in hopes of provoking a 
TV-worthy response. Presumably, that would include someone giving him the 
finger. Meanwhile, the smarmy Holloway popped in and out as his puppeteering 
mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe just crowed when he got O.J. Simpson's lead defense attorney, Robert 
Shapiro, to shake hands with him. But his biggest coup was pestering other 
reporters. That included relentlessly tagging after ABC's Jeff Greenfield and 
pushing a mike at his face while asking him questions so witlessly inane and 
banal as to make Howard Stern's resident party crasher, Stuttering John, look 
like Ted Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
 First ignoring his tormentor, then testily telling him to bug off, Greenfield 
ultimately acknowledged Joe by stonily muttering something to the effect that 
"this is very unpleasant business." 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, it was. "Premier Story's" business is unpleasant business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to creating mischief, the goal of "Premier Story," apparently, was 
to wittily do unto the media what the media have been doing unto others. And 
let's face it, the frenzied pack journalism practiced by the hordes outside the 
Criminal Courts Building hardly puts them on the side of the angels. (That ABC 
News would even dispatch to the scene a correspondent as high-ranking as the 
New York-based Greenfield reflected the extent to which it also had been sucked 
down into the same cesspool.) Thus, it wasn't that Joe's targets were so high 
that gave this entire exercise a kind of sad futility but that he and "Premier 
Story" had somehow found a way to descend even lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Premier Story" devoted its Wednesday night episode to the tragedy at Cheiry, 
with Holloway sitting at her antique desk while doing satellite interviews 
about "the most gruesome act of human self-destruction" since Jonestown. So 
many victims, so many surviving family members to harass, so many rumors to 
unearth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm off to Switzerland," Holloway announced at the end of the program. That's 
the good news. The bad news? She'll be back. 
</P>

<P>
 SELF-LOVE. Three cheers for the Hollywood Women's Press Club, which annually 
awards scholarships to college students in journalism, communications and 
related fields. This year's nine winners are an especially impressive group. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those attending Tuesday night's event in Beverly Hills honoring them may 
have wondered why a TV camera person there was interested in only one of the 
participants. The mystery was cleared up on that evening's KABC-TV Channel 7 
news at 11 p.m., when co-anchor Lisa McRee introduced a brief story on the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among the presenters, our very own 'Eyewitness News' anchor, Christine Lund," 
McRee reported over footage showing Lund at a podium in a filled room. After 
describing the nature of the awards, McRee added, "Congratulations to all!" 
</P>
<P>
 "You bet!" said co-anchor Harold Greene. 
</P>
<P>
 Just who they were congratulating -- Lund or the students -- is open to 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the self-glorifying chauvinism of TV news, you wouldn't have expected 
Channel 7 to have mentioned that other presenters that night included KCBS-TV 
Channel 2 anchor Linda Alvarez and KNBC-TV Channel 4 reporter Laurel Erickson. 
But much more inexcusable was omitting the name of the scholarship winner, John 
Christopher Hyke, whom Lund was seen praising on the videotape shot by her own 
station. Obviously, Lund, not the winners, was the star of this story, and her 
being there mattered more to Channel 7 than the reason for her presence. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't have hurt, either, for the station to have mentioned the other 
winners: Elaine Adolfo, Ryan John Bache, Robert Foster, Christine Ann Kelley, 
Karen E. Loeschner, Wendy Jo Maynard, Eva Sippel and Mary Gretchen Wentz. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the recipients are bright, dedicated people who, unlike the so-called 
pros at Channel 7, surely understand that the message of a news story should 
never be the messenger.

HOLLYWOOD CONSERVATIVES TAKING A STAND; SUMMIT: THIS WEEKEND'S MEETING IS AIMED 
AT CHANGING PERCEPTIONS AS WELL AS TACKLING SUCH ISSUES AS WHETHER CENSORSHIP 
IS NEEDED TO PRESERVE 'DECENT FAMILY SHOWS' AND THE ROLE OF POLITICS IN ART.

 Not everyone thinks of "Magnum, P.I." when they think of Tom Selleck. For some 
people, the key Selleck medium is the National Review, the conservative journal 
he touted for free in a commercial in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with the magazine when I was in college, and it kept me thinking 
three-dimensionally," Selleck said. "I also subscribe to the (centrist-liberal) 
New Republic. But when you do a movie and you see a review where the lead 
paragraph is 'This National Review pitchman . . ., ' you realize someone has 
confused things." 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Selleck said he has attended only three political events in 
the past dozen years, he said he's consistently described as conservative and 
even ultra-conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have I been persecuted? No. Has it affected hiring? I'm not sure. Probably 
with some people. I don't think it helps." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly to help change such perceptions, Hollywood's not-so-silent minority and 
their supporters are banding together this weekend for a conservative summit on 
the entertainment industry, "The Dream Factor and the American Dream: Hollywood 
and American Culture." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of hundred participants are expected to attend two days of seminars 
at the Century Plaza Hotel, co-sponsored by the National Review Institute and 
the L.A.-based Center for the Study of Popular Culture, both of which hold 
events advancing conservative thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers me when I meet conservatives (in Hollywood) who are afraid to use 
their names and be conservatives in this town," said David Horowitz, president 
of the study center, who originated the idea for the conference. "I remember 
(people) being marginalized as a leftist, and now you're marginalized as a 
conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Panels will include conservative activists Arianna Huffington and Bruce 
Herschensohn, performers Pat Sajak and Gerald McRaney ("Major Dad") and 
writer-director Lionel Chetwynd ("The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz" 
screenplay), as well as columnists, critics and academics. 
</P>
<P>
 They will ponder whether censorship is needed to preserve "decent family 
shows," the role of politics in art, Hollywood's impact on the world and "the 
difficulties in presenting goodness and decency to an audience that is cynical 
and sophisticated." Hollywood's conservative elder-statesman Charlton Heston 
will be feted at a tribute dinner Saturday evening hosted by Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 While the organizers say they were hoping for a spirited exchange of ideas 
with members of Hollywood's liberal community, they may find themselves mostly 
preaching to the converted. Several have turned down invitations to speak for 
various reasons, although a sprinkling are expected to attend, including 
producer and panelist Lynda Obst ("The Fisher King"). 
</P>
<P>
 Horowitz said some have declined to participate out of concern with being 
linked to conservatives who are stigmatized in Hollywood. "I tried to get a 
friend of mine and she was reluctant to be associated (with the conference), 
which is unfortunate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference is the latest salvo in the conservative tussle with Hollywood, 
along the lines of Dan Quayle's speech attacking TV's "Murphy Brown" for 
lacking "family values." Some organizers are hoping to send a message to 
Hollywood to make more films "honoring the family as the building block in 
society," as National Review Institute Chairman and former Delaware Gov. Pete 
DuPont put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to encourage some fresh thinking about America," he said. "I'd 
want to see a different culture portrayed on the screen of high moral values 
instead of no values at all. We'd obviously like to see less murders and less 
violence. We'd like to see some heroes that are ordinary people." 
</P>
<P>
 But organizers are also concerned about being perceived as self-righteous 
naysayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conference isn't intended to be an assault on Hollywood by people who are 
presenting themselves as virtuous," said National Review editor John 
O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forrest Gump" also surfaced in conference materials as the conservative 
mascot movie emblematic of "a new breeze in Hollywood" celebrating 
"conservative values of loyalty, decency, honor, duty." "Gump's girlfriend 
follows a countercultural path through radical politics, drugs and a generally 
disordered life until she dies of AIDS," the organizers' promotional letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan says, "Loyalty, honor, courage -- I would think people would see 
them as conservative virtues. What makes any virtue conservative or liberal is: 
Does a virtue imply hard decisions, self-reliance, the things you have to do 
for yourself and other people, rather than have state institutions do them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Gump" co-producer Steve Tisch, who is not attending the summit, said the film 
wasn't intended as a conservative statement. "These are more than political 
values, and they're more than American values. They're human values. . . . I 
don't want any political group to feel they have an ownership of 'Forrest 
Gump.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And not everyone involved with the conference deems such qualities as 
necessarily conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have worded it that way," said panelist Michael Medved, film 
critic and author of "Hollywood vs. America." " 'Forrest Gump' (has 
conservative elements) clearly with its sympathetic treatment of religious 
values and its fairly sympathetic treatment of the military. But I don't think 
(director) Bob Zemeckis started out to make a conservative testament. This 
isn't intended as an answer to Oliver Stone." 
</P>
<P>
 Zemeckis declined to comment through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Medved also detects a trend in the development of more conservative-friendly 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a real conscious attempt to reconnect with the segment of the 
movie audience that has been largely lost," he said. "There's an attempt to 
create more movies for families. The No. 1 movie is 'The Lion King' and the No. 
1 TV show is 'Home Improvement.' Both are about very decent fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it just seems to me that the sort of alienation of the audience I was 
writing about in my book still goes on in many films, but it's much less 
intense. There's a recognition that it's a good way to make money -- it's the 
best motivation in the world. It's also different kinds of people coming into 
the Hollywood community and being empowered."

IT TAKES ALL KINDS TO PAY A TV 'TRIBUTE' TO PRESLEY; POP MUSIC: FROM TONY 
BENNETT TO HEAVY METAL'S SCORPIONS, THE KING'S INFLUENCES WILL BE HONORED IN A 
PAY-PER-VIEW CONCERT SATURDAY FROM MEMPHIS.

 Tony Bennett on the same bill as heavy metal band Scorpions? Hard-rocking L7 
doing a show with Michael Bolton? Cher sharing time with Iggy Pop? 
</P>
<P>
 That's just some of the lineup for "Elvis: The Tribute," the concert being 
televised on pay-per-view from Memphis on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought the rumors about Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley 
singing together at the show sounded weird. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Jackson-Presleys will not be on the show, but all those others will, 
as will the likes of country star Travis Tritt and reggae act Chaka Demus & 
Pliers. 
</P>
<P>
 What do all of them have to do with the King of Rock 'n' Roll? 
</P>
<P>
 "Elvis absorbed what there was of music before him -- gospel, country, blues 
-- and hit on a synthesis that made all these streams accessible to the rest of 
the world," says Don Was, the musician-producer who is serving as music 
director for the show -- the first Elvis tribute ever officially sanctioned by 
the Presley estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to reflect how he had influenced everybody who came after, and how 
none of us who make a living out of music would be here today without that." 
</P>
<P>
 Artists who are more readily associated with the spirit of Elvis are on board 
-- U2 will be represented in a pre-taped performance of "Can't Help Falling in 
Love," and there are unconfirmed reports that Bruce Springsteen will make an 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Was says no one artist captures the vast range that Presley encompassed -- 
in fact he enlisted three different backing bands to cover all the musical 
bases. Presley's original partners, guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer D.J. 
Fontana, will back some acts, while the rock band NRBQ and a country-rock house 
band anchored by Was on bass will work with others. 
</P>
<P>
 Was -- who is also producing an album from the show -- had hoped to make the 
show even more "eclectic," but some acts just weren't available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reuniting the Clash just didn't seem possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Elvis: The Tribute" will be telecast pay-per-view on Saturday, 9 p.m., and 
is expected to run nearly three hours, with a repeat immediately afterward. 
(Check with your cable company for prices and availability.) A 90-minute 
special culled from the show will be aired by ABC-TV in December.

LOVE OF BEETHOVEN INSPIRES A SHARING OF CULTURES; MUSIC: ABOUT 1,000 JAPANESE 
AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS WILL UNITE TO PRESENT THE NINTH SYMPHONY AT THE 
HOLLYWOOD BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When he made his Hollywood Bowl choral debut in the '70s, singer Stephen 
Gothold was pretty impressed with the sound of 120 voices participating in 
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, however, no big deal compared with his Japanese choral debut in 
February singing the same piece at Tokyo's National Sports Arena. There, his 
was one of 5,200 voices for Beethoven's Ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes what many people are hoping will be Gothold's best Beethoven's Ninth 
experience yet: the sound of 950 voices, from Japan as well as Southern 
California, filling the Hollywood Bowl. Now director of choral activities at 
Whittier College and founding conductor of Chorale Bel Canto, Gothold will lead 
his choirs and others in the joyous symphony on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Western world, Beethoven's Ninth is the stuff of church services, 
weddings and symphony halls. (In the 1965 Beatles film "Help!," its "Ode to 
Joy" was also the only thing that could placate the man-eating Bengal tiger.) 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Asahi Homecast Corp., a Pasadena-based Japanese-language 
radio and TV programmer that is organizing and promoting the Bowl concert, in 
Japan, Beethoven's 1824 masterpiece is nothing short of "Jingle Bells" in terms 
of its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese contemporary culture is not limited to Kabuki theater, Asahi 
president Mayumi Shirai told a press conference here recently. "There are 
thousands and thousands of people in communities from Hokkaido (in northern 
Japan) to Okinawa (in southern Japan) singing Beethoven in German," she said. 
"This is the way they receive and welcome the new year." 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Hiroshi Ishimaru, who has led similar "Daiku" concerts in Sumida 
City outside Tokyo for a decade, will conduct the Japan America Symphony 
Orchestra and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra at the Bowl. In addition to 250 
Japanese singers, who are paying their own way here from Tokyo, several Los 
Angeles and Orange County choruses are participating. 
</P>
<P>
 The choruses include the Chorale Bel Canto, Cypress Masterworks Chorale, Gay 
Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, Saddleback Master Chorale, Saint Peter's by the 
Sea Presbyterian Church Sanctuary Choir, Whittier College Choir and Korean 
Master Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the choruses have performed the Beethoven elsewhere, Gothold says, but 
few in so major a venue as the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gothold began weekly rehearsals for about 140 people last month, the 
Japanese contingent didn't arrive until Tuesday, just a few days before the 
Bowl concert. Then again, the Sumida City singers couldn't be better rehearsed. 
Young or old, professionals or amateurs, many of them have been performing the 
work annually in Japan for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Japan America's music director Heiichiro Ohyama, conductor 
Ishimaru began annual concerts in Sumida City 10 years ago to expand the 
audience for classical music. "Hiroshi Ishimaru felt classical music should 
belong to everyone," says Ohyama, "not just the elite but the common man also." 
</P>
<P>
 Gothold had a chance to see that first-hand in February when he assembled an 
American contingent of 30 singers, including himself, for the Sumida City 
annual show. "I felt it would be slow and cumbersome," says Gothold, "and 
couldn't possibly be any good. But it was wonderful, very spirited Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what they're hoping for at the Hollywood Bowl, of course. The Bowl is a 
familiar Los Angeles landmark for the Japanese, and conductor Ishimaru is 
quoted in a press release saying that "as a child, I used to dream of the 
opportunity to conduct at the Hollywood Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 "Daiku" translates literally as "number nine," and conductor Ohyama says the 
fact that it refers to the popular Beethoven Ninth, "is understood." (In 
keeping with that theme, Ohyama will also lead the orchestras in Dvorak's Ninth 
Symphony in E Minor, "From the New World," also popular with and familiar to 
Japanese concert-goers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shirai hopes this will be the first of many annual "Daiku" concerts, she says, 
forecasting ever-increasing participation by more and more singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this 1,000 will be 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 in future years," says 
Shirai. "We'd like to see people from all over the world come to Los Angeles 
for this." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Daiku" concert tickets are available from $3 to $100 for Saturday's 
performance at 8 p.m. at the Hollywood Bowl. Tickets can be purchased by 
calling Ticketmaster at (213) 480-3232. Corporate box seats are $250 each, 
including dinner and parking, and may be purchased through Asahi directly at 
(818) 449-0018.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; NEW SATELLITE TV SYSTEM SET TO CHALLENGE CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Satellite TV systems have been around for years, but most people have never 
been interested because the dish is expensive and huge. A new system getting 
its local launch this week may cause them to think again, and could pose a 
serious challenge to cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The Digital Satellite System (DSS), manufactured by RCA/Thomson Consumer 
Electronics, consists of a satellite dish that is only 18 inches in diameter 
and attaches to the side of the house; a digital, VCR-sized receiver and an 
interactive remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still not cheap, selling for $700. An installation kit costs $70 and 
professional installation can cost about $200. 
</P>
<P>
 The 175-channel system offers programming from two networks, USSB and DIRECTV, 
that is comparable to what's on cable, including HBO, Showtime, ESPN, MTV, 
VH-1, the Comedy Channel, Lifetime and pay-per-view films and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly fees vary, and each network offers a different assortment of 
programming. The full package is $34 a month from USSB and $30 a month from 
DIRECTV -- and each offers cheaper deals by subscribing to fewer channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly Digital Satellite System's biggest selling point, though -- and where 
it leaves cable in the dust -- is audio-visual excellence. The DSS picture is 
laser-disc-quality, far sharper and brighter than what's on regular TV or 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a cleaner picture because it's digital -- versus analog in cable and 
in the regular satellite system," said USSB President Stanley E. Hubbard. "You 
could get much better quality from the standard analog system but you'd need a 
lot of special equipment. With digital, that quality is a given part of the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 DSS equipment is being sold at nearly 250 stores in the Los Angeles area alone 
-- including Sears, the Good Guys and Circuit City. Hubbard said DSS has 
debuted in 23 states since June -- with 100,000 units sold -- and will be 
available nationwide by the end of the month.  
</P>
<P>
 A major difference in cable and DSS is that you can't get local stations 
through DSS. That means no ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox. That's not a problem if you 
can get their signals over the air, by a conventional antenna. But for those 
who need cable to get decent reception, the cost of paying for that and DSS may 
be too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, cable systems around the country are likely to feel the effects of DSS 
during the next year. "About half of our customers come from cabled areas," 
Hubbard said. "Most of them are not continuing to subscribe to cable." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some points that Hubbard made about DSS: 
</P>
<P>
 * DSS is mainly for single-family homes, not apartments or condos, but next 
year there will probably be a way to market DSS to these complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 * RCA is the only company manufacturing DSS units now -- at a rate of 100,000 
per month. Sony will enter the market after 1 million units have been sold, 
which should be next spring, Hubbard predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 * DIRECTV is hoping to offer a package of National Football League games next 
season on its pay-per-view channels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Surround sound is being explored. 
</P>
<P>
 * There will be no hard-core adult channel. The Playboy Channel, on DIRECTV, 
is as risque as it gets on DSS. 
</P>
<P>
 * There's a soundtrack channel that allows consumers to get Spanish-language 
soundtracks on programs for which one is available. 
</P>
<P>
 * A major storm between the satellite dish and the satellite itself can cause 
a loss of signal, but he said that happens less than 2% of the time. More Tech

 Launched two years ago by Philips, the Digital Compact Cassette has been a 
horrible flop. The primary feature of the format is that the machines play both 
digital and conventional cassettes. According to industry sources, Philips is 
about to relaunch DCC with a new ad campaign, new products and, most important, 
cheaper prices. . . . To take advantage of the home theater boom, CurtCo 
Publishing has launched an informative new monthly magazine, Home Theater 
Technology. If you're looking to get into home theater -- or to improve your 
home theater components -- it's the best guide on the market. What's New On 
Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurassic Park" (MCA/Universal, $25). Main question: Are the dinosaur 
sequences just as breathtaking on a TV screen? Not really, but they're still 
pretty scary -- particularly that chase through the lab near the end. Directed 
by Steven Spielberg and starring Sam Neill and Laura Dern, the movie is about 
dinosaurs running amok in a theme park.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas" (Touchstone, $20). Inventive, often 
captivating musical comedy done in stop-motion animation, with the characters 
resembling herky-jerky puppets. The hero is skeletal Jack Skellington from 
Halloweentown, who's bored with Halloween. He stumbles onto the Christmas 
spirit and decides to give the holiday a ghoulish make-over. Caution: may be 
too scary for kids under 6 or 7.  
</P>
<P>
 "Above the Rim" (New Line). Gritty, fairly entertaining tale of a high school 
basketball player (Duane Martin) lured into a gang world. A host of cliches 
undercut its impact, but there are some first-rate basketball scenes and a 
strong hip-hop score. The best reason to see this is the mesmerizing 
performance by Tupac Shakur as a cold-blooded gangster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surviving the Game" (New Line). A homeless man (Ice-T) is the prey at a swank 
retreat where hunters pay big money to track and kill humans. A good, grisly 
action film with Rutger Hauer and Gary Busey, who proves once again that he 
plays villains as well as any actor in the business. It's the same plot as the 
Jean-Claude Van Damme movie "Hard Target." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign language movies: FoxVideo's "The Wedding Banquet" is just out. It's 
about a gay male couple, one American and one Taiwanese, living in Manhattan. 
When the parents of the Taiwanese, who don't know their son is gay, come to 
visit, he stages a fake wedding with a female artist. An engaging, clever 
farce. . . . Chinese director Chen Kaige's "Farewell My Concubine" (Miramax) is 
a colorful, often fascinating epic, covering a period from the '20s to the 
'70s, recounting the volatile relationship between two male performers in the 
Peking Opera. An enlightening glimpse into a seldom-seen world.

 Together, they make smiling sitcoms designed to entertain families at 8 p.m. 
Together, they write friendly characters who learn from their mistakes. And, 
together, they are ignored by critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I think we're sort of dismissed as being irrelevant a lot of times," 
Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not too concerned. For one thing, they practically rule ABC's highly 
promoted "Thank God It's Friday" lineup of sitcoms. Bickley and Warren are 
executive producers of "Family Matters" and "Step by Step," which they created, 
and of "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper," which they were asked to take over last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two producers may not get respect from the critics, they certainly 
get ratings from viewers. "Family Matters" and "Step by Step" easily won their 
time slots last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "These shows are speaking for an audience who craves this kind of 
entertainment," said Tony Jonas, executive vice president of creative affairs 
for Warner Bros. TV. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes Bickley and Warren can work their magic on his studio's "Hangin' With 
Mr. Cooper," starring Mark Curry, which has already gone through two sets of 
producers in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, while critics may say their stories and themes are lightweight, 
that's not the case," Jonas said. "Because these shows are striking a chord 
with millions of young people in America. When my kids are watching TGIF on 
Friday night, I'm sitting watching with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bickley, 47, and Warren, 51, have produced 400 episodes of sitcoms while at 
Warner Bros. in the last eight years, spending $60 million annually in 
production budgets. They learned under three of the most prolific TV producers 
in the industry's history. 
</P>
<P>
 They were first paired up as a team in 1976 by "Happy Days" creator Garry 
Marshall. In recent years, they have worked under or in association with two 
more "Happy Days" alumni, producers Tom Miller and Bob Boyett, whose shows 
include "Perfect Strangers," "Full House" and "Bosom Buddies." 
</P>
<P>
 "They know how to utilize characters and go through their growth and 
development -- not just in a single episode, but over the course of a season," 
said Boyett, who hired Bickley and Warren to take over producing chores on 
"Perfect Strangers" in 1986. "That distinguishes them from everyone else out 
there doing it. Because the theory some producers have is that once you get a 
prototype show, you just keep doing that show every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Bickley and Warren were not always so clear on who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, both were young and cynical. Warren was a USC cinema school dropout 
making documentary films for evangelist Billy Graham. Bickley was a recent 
graduate in English literature from Baylor University in Texas, who cashed in 
his dreams of becoming a novelist to pursue TV writing. He had just moved to 
Los Angeles, where he got his first assignment on "Love American Style," 
followed by episodes of "All in the Family" and "The Partridge Family." 
</P>
<P>
 By chance, the two separately sought refuge at a popular revivalist church off 
Sunset Strip called First Baptist Church of Beverly Hills. The youthful 
outreach program appealed to street kids, homeless people, struggling 
musicians, drug users and other "unusual Christians," as Bickley described 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a place that attracted people who were going through what I was going 
through at the time -- a real disillusionment of anything mainstream," Bickley 
said. "But it was a real safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Bickley and Warren met. "We'd get together and talk about 
television and films and found that we had common interests," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bickley added: "We made each other laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 The two eventually found their direction in mainstream television, where they 
could instill their sense of right and wrong into the TV scripts they wrote, 
without shoving it down people's throats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall recalled Bickley and Warren's spirituality fondly: "They seemed to be 
in the ministry at some point. They were lay ministers or something. Since most 
of the comedy writers on 'Happy Days' were fast-talking ethnic guys from New 
York, Ron Howard would get scared. So I said, 'Here are the ministers -- they 
write for you.' Finally, everyone got along real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the two did some evangelizing and public speaking, but they were 
hardly ministers, Bickley said with a laugh. "That's Garry. He had us write any 
episode with a nun or a priest, although neither of us were Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody brings a value system to their work," said Warren, whose unsold 
pilot series with Bickley include one called "Pastor Prine" in 1978. "I think 
everybody does that. They see the world and characters and interaction through 
the eyes of what their world view is. There's places we don't want to go in 
storytelling. There's behavior we don't want to endorse." 
</P>
<P>
 Two seasons ago, the two did an episode of "Step by Step" in which Cody, 
played by Sasha Mitchell, was seduced by a young girl. In his decision not to 
sleep with her, he explained that he didn't want to have sex before he was 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response we got off this show was huge," Warren said. "The whole network 
focus was to do an episode about safe sex," Warren said. "But to do an episode 
that basically said abstinence is an alternative was, like, why would you even 
do that? But the mail response was tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know who you're talking to. It's a powerful thing, television," 
Bickley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Bickley and Warren feel a great responsibility for what they 
put on the air. "As corny as it sounds, I don't want to make shows I couldn't 
sit and watch with my children if they were little," said Warren, whose two 
children are now in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to portray people who are real and conflicts in families that are 
real," said Bickley, who has two sons in college and a 14-year-old daughter. 
"We try to start out with characters who, whatever their flaws, deep inside 
want to do the right thing -- rather than starting with people who don't even 
have the desire." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Boyett have been referred to as a comedy factory for years, and 
Bickley and Warren hope to follow in their footsteps. They've parted ways and 
will produce any future projects independently.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most producers, Marshall said, "They didn't think every moment in their 
career was the end of their career. They took time. They enjoyed life and spent 
time with their kids. Winning your time slot is not the answer to life."

 Andrea Fuhrmann, 22, who holds the Miss Stanton title, will translate in sign 
language for a group of deaf children when they visit Disneyland for the first 
time today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann, who was 60% deaf before a successful operation two years ago, will 
help about 20 deaf children from Vancouver get to know the amusement park as 
guests of Air Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann's father, Robert, a customer services manager for the airline in Los 
Angeles, helped organize the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called "Dreams Take Flight," started five years ago when Air 
Canada delivered more than 100 disadvantaged children to Disney World in 
Florida, Robert Fuhrmann said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, another contingent came to Disneyland. That "trip was so popular 
and the company has had so much positive feedback, that this year there will be 
two trips," Fuhrmann said. Other chaperons will be members of the Stanton 
American Legion.  
</P>
<P>
 The second contingent will arrive Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Fuhrmann, who acted as a tour guide last year, said: "I'm very excited. 
. . . I think the kids like me to be there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann, who will be Miss Stanton until November, is a student at Cypress 
College. She has undergone two operations in her life, the first when she was 
10, and now has 95% normal hearing.TOM RAGAN

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: BOOM-BUST MENTALITY: LESSONS FROM THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe you can't be too rich or too thin, but the economy can be -- too rich, 
at least, for the stock and bond markets' tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 With each piece of economic data over the past month, it has become apparent 
that U.S. business activity isn't slowing appreciably. In fact, it isn't 
slowing at all in many sectors of industry, even though the Federal Reserve 
Board has raised interest rates five times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, in another bit of good news for working people -- and mostly bad 
news for stock and bond owners -- the latest four-week data on the number of 
Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to a five-year low. 
</P>
<P>
 That sets the stage for today's report on September employment, which, if also 
bullish for the economy, will be just the opposite for Wall Street. Interest 
rates could jump again and stocks could resume their latest selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, for anyone hunting for work or thinking of starting a business 
this year, the financial markets have become a great reverse-indicator: The 
worse they look, the better the economy, in general, must be. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider for example that while the bank prime lending rate has jumped from 6% 
to 7.75% since February, major loans outstanding at commercial banks have risen 
by nearly $100 billion, to $2.03 trillion -- hardly a sign that business 
borrowers find the higher rates a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 For the auto industry, sales of cars and trucks are robust and growing more 
so, if September trends are an indication. "It's just wall-to-wall strong," a 
senior General Motors executive boasted this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for GM investors, that is. Their stock price fell to a new 1994 low of 
$44 on Thursday and is now down 33% from its record high of $65.375 last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's business is up but its stock is down. Why? The simple answer is that many 
investors have become increasingly unable to enjoy the economy's good times, 
because they are already looking ahead to the bad times they expect will 
follow. And as the good times get better, investors assume that the bad times 
will be that much worse. In other words, that boom will lead to bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger for markets now is that the boom-bust mind-set will become the 
dominant mind-set. Greg Smith, investment strategist at Prudential Securities 
in New York and one of the stock market's premier "big thinkers," is warning 
clients to prepare for what he dubs "the new world economic order." The 
underlying assumption of the new order, he says, is that "the world economy is 
building up quite a head of steam" as capitalism's spread begets consumerist 
societies on every continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, says Smith, even if the Fed continues to slowly raise interest rates to 
hold down U.S. economic growth, rising demand for American goods and services 
in the rest of the world provides an offset. The U.S. economy, therefore, may 
continue to expand at a higher rate than the Fed thinks is prudent. So interest 
rates keep rising, while business nonetheless keeps getting better. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, such an environment would be bad for bonds. Stock prices, 
meanwhile, could continue to be tugged between the positive force of higher 
earnings and the negative force of rising interest rates, as they have been all 
year, with little net progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The big risk for stocks today is that as the economy rolls on and interest 
rates keep pushing higher, more investors will begin to treat most stocks the 
way they have come to treat the auto stocks: totally looking past the current 
boom to the inevitable bust somewhere in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts who are bullish on the downtrodden auto stocks contend 
that any bust is far off; they say the auto companies' earnings will be higher 
in 1995 and higher still in 1996 and that the stocks therefore deserve better. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument was also heard in 1984, when, like today, the Fed was raising 
interest rates and investors began to focus on prospects for an economic bust 
rather than bet on sustained growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The optimists turned out to be right in 1984. Higher rates did not precipitate 
recession. The economy grew in 1985, 1986 and 1987, and the auto stocks soared 
as their sales and earnings rose. 
</P>
<P>
 But before investors got over their fears in 1984, they did some severe damage 
in the stock market. Fretting about interest rates and an imagined economic 
bust, the market slashed Ford Motor's stock price by 30% between 1983 and '84, 
and at its '84 low it sold for a mere 2.1 times that year's earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, Ford is off 22% from its peak price and sells for 6.4 times 
estimated 1994 earnings. Maybe it's already cheap enough. But the 1984 lesson 
was that, once a boom-bust mentality takes control of investors, things can get 
very bad for stocks before they get better again. The Big 3, Then and Now 
</P>
<P>
 As in 1984, the Big Three auto stocks have tumbled this year even though sales 
have been booming. But while some analysts argue that the stocks are 
dirt-cheap, their price-to-earnings ratios remain far above the trough levels 
of 1984. 04,17,06,06,10 GM Ford Chrysler Stock price decline, '83-84 -24% -30%

SBA LOANS IN SOUTHLAND RISE 23% TO RECORD LEVEL; ECONOMY: HEAD OF AGENCY'S 
LOCAL OFFICE SAYS THE GROWTH IS ANOTHER SIGN OF THE REGION'S RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In another sign of Southern California's economic recovery, business loans 
made by the Small Business Administration bounced back sharply in the latest 
fiscal year, surpassing $700 million in the region's six-county area. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary figures for the 12 months ended Sept. 30 show that the SBA's 
district offices in Los Angeles and Santa Ana made business loans totaling 
about $708 million, an increase of 23% from the previous 12 months and slightly 
more than the record $700 million loaned in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 "This past year's figure indicates a strengthening economy," said Alberto G. 
Alvarado, the new head of the SBA's Los Angeles district office. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Schwarz, president of St. Clair Plastics Inc. in Santa Fe Springs, last 
month used a $500,000 SBA loan to buy and move into a bigger facility for his 
growing plastic-injection molding business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were renting in a ratty brick building," Schwarz said. Now, his company is 
in a newer structure with double the manufacturing space. "We can look outside 
and see pine trees and lawns." he said. "I feel like we've arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarz's company was one of 1,865 businesses in Southern California to 
receive SBA loans in the latest 12-month period -- up from 1,515 in the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency's regular business lending program in Southern California 
fell sharply in fiscal 1992-93 for the first time during the recession as the 
region's weak economy and widespread problems with fraudulent loan applications 
took a heavy toll. 
</P>
<P>
 (The loans are completely separate and apart from hundreds of millions of 
dollars lent after the riots, wildfires and earthquakes as part of the SBA's 
special disaster loan program.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, however, SBA officials have put a tighter check on fraud and 
introduced a new loan program that cuts down on both paperwork and processing 
time. Because of that and the strengthening economy, bankers in the region say, 
they are seeing greater demand and more businesses qualifying for the federally 
guaranteed loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy's improved -- that's been one of the driving forces," said David 
Scherer, senior vice president at Bank of Yorba Linda, whose SBA loan volume 
surged more than 50% in the past year to about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherer's bank is among many institutions that have aggressively built up 
their SBA loan portfolios during the recession years. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA guarantees 70% to 90% of the amount of loans up to $750,000, so banks 
deem them relatively risk-free.  
</P>
<P>
 "Banks are realizing that it is an excellent program for their small-business 
customer," said Bob Coleman, editor of the Coleman Report, a Pasadena-based 
newsletter for SBA lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman also attributed the higher SBA loan volume to the SBA's steps to weed 
out fraudulent loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
 False tax returns filed in support of SBA loans have contributed to a high 
rate of defaults and loan rejections in Southern California, but in the past 
year the agency has been cross-checking tax forms submitted by SBA applicants 
against filings with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The past year has seen a particular surge in SBA business loans made to 
acquire property, especially industrial buildings, which banks are reluctant to 
finance after the real estate slump of the past few years, during which 
commercial foreclosures soared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeing a lot of real estate purchases," said Kate McCloskey, an SBA loan 
consultant in Santa Ana. McCloskey, who makes money by helping clients put 
together SBA loan applications, says her business has more than doubled this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a tremendous upsurge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the SBA's Santa Ana office -- despite a big decline in fiscal 
1992-93 because of the recession -- has been the fastest-growing district in 
the nation and now ranks ahead of Chicago, New York and Seattle in total loan 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the businesses that received SBA loans in the past year was Zet-Tek 
Inc., a dental implant manufacturer in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 David Zettler, the firm's president, said he did not think he could get 
conventional financing to buy a 20,000-square-foot building in Anaheim that 
would allow him to get out of "sky-high rents" that he was paying. So Zettler 
turned to the SBA, which approved a loan for $720,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has tripled in the last year," he said, adding that his company's 
sales this year are projected to reach $2 million. The company has added 10 
employees, he said, for a total 26. "We feel very fortunate." Loan Boom An 
improving economy has created a dramatic increase in the number of loans issued 
by the Small Business Administration office in Santa Ana. For fiscal years,

RISING MORTGAGE RATES SHAKE BUT DON'T BREAK STATE HOUSING INDUSTRY; REAL 
ESTATE: ECONOMISTS SAY AFFORDABILITY OF HOMES REMAINS HIGH FOR NOW. BUT THE 
THREAT OF DOUBLE DIGITS IS CAUSING MORE THAN A FEW ULCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The jump in interest rates on home loans that began last October has caused 
plenty of heartburn and uncertainty in California's housing industry, but the 
increases have yet to imperil the state's modest real estate recovery that 
began in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, even if rates continue to rise as expected, real estate experts 
doubt that the damage will be severe -- provided the increases do not carry 
rates well into double digits. Economists say that's because housing 
affordability remains high and home prices remain low -- at least by California 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lieser, an economist at the Business Forecasting Project of UCLA's 
Anderson School of Management, said rates would have to rise to more than 12% 
to offset the decline in housing prices since the peak of 1990. And few 
economists see rates rising soon to the double-digit levels they last reached 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, rates have climbed more than two percentage points in the last 
year, causing considerable turmoil in the mortgage market statewide and 
nationally. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * People holding large adjustable-rate mortgages have seen their house 
payments soar by hundreds of dollars a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * The amount of new loans has plummeted. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 
or Freddie Mac, says national loan originations in 1994 will amount to $710 
billion, a sharp drop from 1993's $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refinancings, which reached record levels in 1993 as interest rates fell, 
have declined drastically. Freddie Mac projects that refinancings will 
constitute only 33% of the total loan market nationally, compared to 56% last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Borrowers are turning away from fixed-rate loans and moving toward 
adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustables will constitute 35% of loan originations 
nationally in the third quarter of 1994, up from only 17% in the same period 
last year, Freddie Mac reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lenders have tried to narrow the so-called spread between rates for 
fixed-rate mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages, making the fixed loans 
relatively more attractive. But loan brokers say adjustable-rate loans remain 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 The average rate in the Los Angeles area for a 30-year, fixed mortgage broke 
the important 9% psychological barrier this week, rising to 9.01%, compared to 
a low of 6.81% a year earlier, according to a survey by HSH Associates, 
financial publishers in Butler, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the average starting rate for a one-year, adjustable-ratemortgage 
in the Los Angeles area reached 5.84%, compared to a low of 3.93% a year ago, 
HSH reported. 
</P>
<P>
 And rates promise to rise further, given the bond market's recent unease and 
speculation that the Federal Reserve Board may raise short-term rates again 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond held firm at 7.94%, 
the highest level since June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people who have adjustable-rate mortgages . . . and who didn't refinance 
will see a two-percentage-point rise this year, there's no doubt about that," 
said Keith T. Gumbinger, an HSH analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the rate increases have not squelched the state's housing market. Sales 
of existing single-family homes statewide are still increasing on an annualized 
basis -- up 4.8% in August over a year earlier, according to the latest figures 
from the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 And there remains pent-up demand for housing, said Gary Schlossberg, senior 
economist with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. The state's incipient 
recovery and subsequent improvement in consumer confidence could help offset 
the effects of higher interest rates, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 For affluent homeowners such as Michael Walther, the rise in rates has meant 
higher monthly mortgage payments, though they haven't proven burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Walther, 41, president of a computer software company in Irvine, 
has seen the interest rate on his adjustable mortgage rise two percentage 
points, the maximum allowable under terms of the loan on his $400,000 Laguna 
Niguel home. 
</P>
<P>
 That has meant an increase of $600 in his monthly mortgage payment, he said. 
The increase was not unexpected: Walther recently refinanced his home and is in 
only the second year of a new mortgage whose starting rate was a discounted 
4.625%. Still, he says, "it made a little less of our money liquid." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Hedman, an interior designer who lives in South Pasadena, was facing a 
$400 increase in the monthly mortgage payment on her four-bedroom house. The 
rate was scheduled to go up to 8.75% from 6.75%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and her husband avoided the increase by refinancing their 
adjustable-rate mortgage this month, getting a new loan with a starting rate of 
6.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the increase in rates this year, housing in California remains 
relatively affordable, according to the Realtors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 39% of the state's households could afford a median-priced home, 
the group reported. That's only a slight decline from the 40% affordability 
figure of a year earlier and well above the low of 14% in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Girard, a manager with Kenneth Leventhal & Co., has seen the interest rate 
on his adjustable mortgage rise to about 7% from 5.5%, increasing the monthly 
mortgage payment on his Pacific Palisades townhouse to more than $2,300 from 
about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But his payments are still well below the $3,300 he was paying on the 10.25% 
fixed-rate mortgage he had in 1990, before he refinanced two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight, I'm glad I did it," he said. "It's always a crapshoot. But it 
paid off for us." Going Up 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates for both fixed and adjustable-rate mortgages are up from their 
near-record lows of October, 1993, and are likely to continue rising if, as 
expected, the Federal Reserve Board keeps raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 30-year, fixed-rate: 8.51% 
</P>
<P>
 Adjustable-rate: 5.47%

FOUR COMPANIES TO TACKLE NEW CHIP TECHNOLOGY; COMPUTERS: IBM, AT&T, LORAL CORP. 
AND MOTOROLA TO JOIN IN DEVELOPING X-RAY LITHOGRAPHY PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual collaboration that could help cement America's newly regained 
leadership in computer chip technology, AT&T, IBM, Motorola and Loral Corp. 
said Thursday that they would jointly develop a key manufacturing technology 
aimed at producing revolutionary advances in the power and sophistication of 
semiconductor chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The four companies said in a joint statement that they would pool their 
efforts in an arcane technology called X-ray lithography, which holds the 
promise of producing computer chips with circuits just one-tenth the width of 
the most advanced chips available today. The narrower the circuits, the more of 
them can be crammed onto a chip. Thus, microprocessor chips, which form the 
brain inside personal computers, could perform many more calculations per 
second, for example, or a memory chip could hold much more information. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, IBM and others, with substantial support from the Department of Defense, 
have spent hundreds of millions -- perhaps billions -- over the past two 
decades on X-ray lithography, but the process is still not commercially viable. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies did not say how much they would invest in the new joint effort, 
but it is expected to total tens of millions of dollars a year, and the federal 
government is expected to contribute comparable sums. Other companies, 
university research labs, and government labs are expected to join the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't develop this we (semiconductor makers) are going to hit a dead 
end, a road block," said John Kelly, general manager of IBM Microelectronics. 
"We have to do this or the industry will stop." Scientists expect the X-ray 
process will be vital to commercial production around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closely related development Thursday, Sematech, an industry-government 
consortium, pledged $30 million to help San Jose-based Silicon Valley Group, a 
major supplier of lithography equipment using the current technology, which 
employs ultraviolet light rather than X-rays to create circuit patterns. Canon 
of Japan has been negotiating with the company to either acquire it or license 
its technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the two announcements signal a major challenge to Japan's leadership 
in the critical semiconductor equipment sector. Canon and Nikon dominate the 
$2-billion business of supplying the lithography machines, known in the 
industry as "steppers". 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has also been considered the leader in developing X-ray lithography, 
with major investments being made by NTT, the nation's telephone monopoly, and 
by a consortium of chip companies and government laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Van Atta, special adviser to the Department of Defense on dual-use 
technology, said the technology is too important to allow America's dependence 
on Japan to continue. "Advanced lithography is necessary for advanced chips, 
and chips are the brains of our weapons system as well as of our computers," 
Van Atta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody agrees that X-ray lithography is the way to go. Intel Corp. 
scientists, for one, have publicly cast doubt on the efficacy of the technology 
and are conspicuously absent from the new consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 But a growing number of scientists agree that chip makers will have no 
alternative but to switch to X-ray technology around the turn of the century. 
And the Department of Defense has backed that view with money and clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Past efforts to counteract Japanese power in lithography, however, have been 
jinxed. GCA, a stepper manufacturer with advanced technology, went bankrupt 
last year when American chip makers were unwilling to take a chance on the 
financially unstable company. 
</P>
<P>
 The last American company seemed about to disappear early this year when Canon 
sought to acquire or license advanced technology from the Silicon Valley Group. 
SVG, as it is known, got its technology from another failed recipient of 
government aid, Perkin-Elmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by such poor results, the Defense Department this year cut back its 
budget request for lithography research to $10 million for 1995 from a total of 
$58 million this year. But Sematech's offer to support SVG appears to be an 
industry show of support for the company and a direct response to the 
government's displeasure at the lack of past support for American equipment 
manufacturers. And Sematech itself has raised its stature by agreeing to wean 
itself from government funds.

 Salomon Expects Big 3rd-Quarter Loss: Salomon Inc. projected that it will lose 
$100 million after taxes in the third quarter, largely as a result of continued 
weakness in trading and underwriting operations.It will mark the investment 
bank's second consecutive period of huge losses and offers one of the more 
conspicuous examples of the damage caused by the downturn in the financial 
markets this year. Salomon, like other major Wall Street brokerages, was hit 
hard by the bond market tumble that began in February. The company reported a 
$200-million deficit in the second quarter. Salomon also cited weakness in 
underwriting volume and trades on behalf of clients. Salomon earned $20 million 
in the year-ago quarter.

 GAO to Review Nasdaq Computer Operations: The General Accounting Office said 
it is reviewing the computer operations of the system, the nation's 
second-largest stock market, after a series of power outages halted trading 
twice this summer. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D.-Mass.), chairman of the House 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers' own investigation of the outages traced the problems to 
computer hardware and power systems malfunctions. It also offered 
recommendations to prevent future problems.

 Kmart Corp. Warns of 3rd-Quarter Earnings Decline: The giant discount 
retailer, the nation's second-largest, said it expects to post its seventh 
straight earnings decline.It said weak apparel sales and promotions on other 
goods are pressuring margins for the quarter ending in October. "This will 
result in a decline in earnings in the 1994 third quarter," Kmart Chairman and 
Chief Executive Joseph Antonini said. The size of the earnings decline depends 
on October business, "which should be more favorable than in September," he 
said. In last year's third quarter, Kmart earned $94 million, or 20 cents a 
share.

 Quake Loss Estimate Rises 25% to $9 Billion: Property damage from the Jan. 17 
Northridge temblor will cost insurers more than previously thought, the 
Property Claim Services industry group said.PCS said losses from paying claims 
are higher than anticipated because damages were more extensive than many 
homeowners had thought and because more repair costs exceeded policy 
deductibles. The group's previous loss estimate, released in August, put the 
figure at $7.2 billion; its original estimate had been $2.5 billion. PCS said 
about 350,000 claims have been filed so far, up from an original estimate of 
230,000. Homeowners' losses represent 76% of all reported claims; commercial 
losses, 12%; auto claims, 9%, and boat claims, 3%.

 State to Scrutinize Health Care Merger: The Florida attorney general's office 
said it will give close antitrust scrutiny to Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corp.'s 
agreement to acquire HealthTrust Inc. for $3.45 billion.Jerome Hoffman, the 
state's antitrust chief, said the attorney general's office will focus on 
Columbia 's influence over managed-care programs and physician hospital 
privileges in several geographic areas: Orlando, St. Petersburg, Ft. Myers, the 
Panhandle and south Florida. Columbia now owns 46 hospitals in Florida, or 
about 20% of hospital capacity in the state, said Dan Moen, president of 
Columbia's Florida Group. The acquisition might limit patients' choices should 
Columbia's bargaining power with managed-care plans and physicians be unduly 
expanded, Hoffman said.

 Triad Healthcare Inc. to Sell or Lease Hospital: The Encino firm, whose 
bankruptcy earlier this year cast a cloud of uncertainty over two San Fernando 
Valley hospitals it owns, said it will sell or lease one of the facilities to 
raise money to repay its debts, among them a defaulted loan insured by the 
state.The company said it is seeking a buyer for its money-losing West Valley 
Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park, a 139-bed facility known locally for 
its programs for expectant mothers and the elderly. Triad acquired the 
hospitals in 1991 with the help of a $167-million loan guaranteed by the state. 
The firm defaulted in July, 1993.

 Corporate Heads See Growth Slowing to Moderate Pace: The economy is headed for 
a "soft landing," with growth slowing to a moderate pace next year as interest 
rates continue to rise, leaders of the nation's largest corporations 
predicted.Nearly 100 active and retired chief executives, members of the elite 
Business Council, gathered for a semiannual conference in Williamsburg, Va., to 
compare notes on the economy. The corporate heads also said they expect 
inflation to increase but that it will peak at low single-digit levels, well 
below the price spirals that plagued earlier periods of growth. Only a few 
predicted the inflation rate would rise as high as 4%.

 Help-Wanted Ads Decline: U.S. newspapers ran fewer help-wanted ads during 
August than July, indicating a slowdown in the labor market, the Conference 
Board reported.The business research group said its widely watched help-wanted 
advertising index sagged to 118 in August from 122 in July. A year ago the 
index stood at 103. "The labor market is clearly cooling," said Ken Goldstein, 
a Conference Board economist. "New hiring is less intense than during the 
summer months, when the economy generated 300,000 new jobs a month." The survey 
covered 51 major newspapers nationwide.

 Continued fears that the Federal Reserve Board will raise short-term interest 
rates pushed stocks lower for the fourth consecutive session Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average fell 11.78 points to 3,775.56. Broader indexes also 
dropped for the fourth straight day, as losers edged winners by 11 to 10 on the 
Big Board in moderate trading.

 In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond yield inched up to a new

mostly flat.

<P>
 Thin trading in stocks and bonds indicated that many investors were sidelined 
ahead of today's release of payroll and unemployment data for September. 
Analysts expect government reports to show that non-farm payrolls increased by 
about 250,000 last month and that the nation's unemployment rate stayed steady 
at 6.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger payroll number or big drop in unemployment could send another signal 
to the Fed that the economy is growing too fast, offering more incentive to the 
central bank to increase short-term interest rates for the sixth time this 
year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow has dropped 4.3% since mid-September as bond yields have rocketed, 
responding to healthy economic reports that suggest the Fed's hikes in 
short-term rates so far this year have done little to cool business activity. 
Worse, inflationary pressures appear to be building in the economy, as demand 
for goods and services remains robust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is pointing to strong retail demand and certainly strong 
production," said John Shaughnessy, research director at Advest Inc. "Stocks 
are going to labor within the context of fears of rising short-term interest 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks were mixed following the release of generally soft September 
sales figures. Analysts believe sales were skewed by unusual weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Among major retailers, K mart dropped 1/2 to 16 3/4, Sears lost 1/2 to 46 1/2 
and TJX tumbled 2 3/8 to 17 7/8. But May Department Stores rose 1/2 to 38 and 
Penney gained 5/8 to 52 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks sank anew. They have been among the biggest victims of higher 
interest rates this year, even though auto sales remain robust. GM plunged 1 
5/8 to 44, Chrysler was off 7/8 to 44 1/4 and Ford slipped 3/8 to 27 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial issues were hit by continued profit-taking. Georgia-Pacific 
dropped 1 3/4 to 73, USX-U.S. Steel lost 1 to 38 3/4 and Union Carbide gave up 
3/4 to 31 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the high tech sector, Apple Computer slid 1 5/8 to 36 1/4 after surging 
on Wednesday on takeover rumors. Elsewhere, Adobe Systems fell 2 to 33 3/4, 
Lotus sank 1 1/8 to 35 1/8 and Oracle Systems dropped 1 1/4 to 41 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But Broderbund jumped 1 3/8 to 52 3/8 on a strong earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei average slid 96.32 points to 19.655.23. In Frankfurt, 
the DAX average closed at 1,955.69, down 13.03 points. London's FTSE 100 index 
rebounded 28.1 points to 2,984.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index eased 4.48 points to 2,636.91.

 Kidder Slashes Work Force: Kidder, Peabody Group Inc., reeling from steep 
losses and an embarrassing financial scandal, cut its staff by 10% and took 
dramatic steps to cleanse its balance sheet. The layoffs of 550 employees, 
effectively immediately, are part of a companywide restructuring that Kidder 
said will pare costs by more than $100 million. Kidder is struggling with sharp 
losses amid a bond trading scandal, rising interest rates that have hammered 
the firm's mortgage bond business, and widespread departures among top 
managers.

CARS: BIGGER IS SAFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety of driver death rates in 
accidents involving 1988-93 passenger cars, vans and trucks found lower 
fatality rates in larger vehicles. The numbers affirm the maxim that bigger is 
better, at least when it comes to crash safety.A separate study of injury rates 
also favored vans and larger cars. Ten of the 12 vehicles with the lowest death 
rates were also equipped with passenger air bags. Rates are indexed to the 
average for all vehicles, with 100 as the average, so a rate of 300 would 
represent a death rate three times the average. Lowest Death Rates

INSURERS END ANTITRUST SUIT FOR $36 MILLION; COURTS: CASE BROUGHT BY 20 STATES 
ACCUSED THE DEFENDANTS, WHO ADMIT NO GUILT, OF RATE CONSPIRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the nation's largest insurance firms agreed Thursday to pay $36 
million to settle a lawsuit by California and 19 other states that charged 
insurers had conspired to raise rates and triggered a liability insurance 
crisis in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for the companies to give up control of a trade 
organization that helps set rates and standards for commercial general 
liability insurance, which covers governments, businesses and nonprofit 
organizations against claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement will address our concerns in a creative fashion by going 
beyond our primary goal of stopping the practices in question," California 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement, which is subject to federal court approval, disappointed 
many insurance industry critics and consumer advocates. They claim the 
settlement won't force the industry to change practices that they allege limit 
competition and drive up rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who thinks that this is reform is deluding themselves," said Los 
Angeles attorney Michael J. Strumwasser, who was an aide to former California 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp when the suit was filed in a San Francisco 
federal court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The antitrust suit claimed that Cigna Corp., Aetna Casualty & Surety, 
Allstate, ITT Hartford Insurance Group and other insurers conspired in 1983 to 
limit the sale of general liability insurance. Other defendants were 28 brokers 
and reinsurers, including several syndicates of Lloyd's of London. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also named New York-based Insurance Services Organization, a 
nationwide trade organization that compiles loss information to help insurance 
companies set rates. Insurance companies allegedly pressured the ISO to change 
insurance forms to limit coverage, the states said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit claims the insurers' actions created an insurance liability crisis 
that saw rates skyrocket and left governments and business without affordable 
coverage. Many small local governments were forced to self-insure or drop and 
curtail operations because coverage became too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance companies denied the charges, saying the rising rates were in 
response to an increased number of lawsuits and costly court judgments.  
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting guilt, the insurers said Thursday that they agreed to settle 
the suit to avoid more costly litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the 32 defendants agreed to contribute a total of $36 
million to provide local governments advice and training on risk management, to 
create a national risk management data base and to reimburse the states' legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance firms also agreed to reorganize the ISO's board to give 
outsiders control. The proposed new board would consist of 11 members, seven of 
whom would be non-insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Control of the ISO by non-insurers will reassure the public, regulators and 
legislators of the organization's independence, the objectivity of the ISO's 
data and analysts and its continued operation in the public interest," the 
board's current chairman, William H. Bolinder, said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, industry critics say such a new ISO board would be far from 
independent. All its proposed members have been selected by current officials 
and are subject to a membership vote. In addition, some of the non-insurer 
directors who would serve on the board have ties to the industry as agents and 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What's independent about a board selected by the insurers?" asked Texas 
Insurance Commissioner J. Robert Hunter.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates and insurance industry critics said the states' lawsuit and 
other reform efforts have been hampered by a federal law that exempts insurers 
from the antitrust laws that apply to most businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the ISO board is controlled by directors with no insurance industry 
ties, the antitrust exemption would have permitted the insurance companies to 
form another group under industry control, insurance observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to prevent illegal insurance practices is to remove the industry 
from the immunity of federal antitrust laws," said Harvey Rosenfield, a 
consumer advocate and one of the industry's most vocal critics.

SANTA FE SAYS NO TO BID FROM UNION PACIFIC; TRANSPORTATION: IN SPURNING ITS 
RIVAL'S $3.2-BILLION OFFER, THE RAILROAD REAFFIRMS PLAN TO MERGE WITH 
BURLINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Fe Pacific Corp. late Thursday spurned a $3.2-billion takeover bid from 
rival Union Pacific Corp. and reaffirmed plans to merge with Burlington 
Northern Inc. in a $2.5-billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The terse rejection announcement by Santa Fe's board says they believe the 
merger with Burlington Northern is better for shareholders despite the lower 
price and that that merger would be far more likely to receive federal 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Union Pacific has now decided to interject a proposal which has little chance 
of being consummated because Union Pacific does not want to compete with a 
merged Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway," the Santa Fe board said in the 
statement issued from its Schaumburg, Ill., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, which made the surprise offer barely 24 hours earlier, said in 
a statement that it is disappointed with the Santa Fe board's response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without ever talking to us, and without due consideration, we think the Santa 
Fe Pacific board has given short shrift to our proposal," said Drew Lewis, 
chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem, Pa.-based Union Pacific.  
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern's board said earlier in the day that it would proceed with 
its lower offer for Santa Fe rather than try to outbid Union Pacific in what it 
foresaw as an expensive railroad takeover brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Santa Fe and Burlington Northern said they believed Union Pacific's high 
bid would be rejected by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates 
the U.S. rail industry and ensures competition in all areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern, which is based in Ft. Worth, said it plans to proceed 
with its merger application with the ICC next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The elbowing between Burlington Northern and Union Pacific marks the latest in 
a merger frenzy aimed at stitching together ever larger and more efficient 
networks to take advantage of a resurgence of the rail industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific operates a 19,000-mile network spanning the West, Midwest and 
Gulf Coast regions. Santa Fe operates an 8,750-mile system that links Chicago, 
the West Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination would create a rail behemoth bigger than Burlington Northern, 
which already operates the longest rail system in North America, a 25,000-mile 
network spanning 25 states and two Canadian provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific has acknowledged that the deal could give it a monopoly on 
traffic between California and the Midwest and wheat shipped by farmers in 
Kansas and Oklahoma. But Union Pacific has offered to work out special deals 
with Burlington and Southern Pacific to preserve competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific "wrongly believes that negotiating with other carriers will 
eliminate the substantial anticompetitive impacts of the merger," Burlington 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific filed suit Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court to try to force 
Santa Fe to open negotiations over the bid. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, Santa Fe closed up 87.5 cents per share at 
$13.50. Union Pacific fell $1.875 to $50, and Burlington Northern fell 50 cents 
to $48.875.

U.S. RETAILERS' HOLIDAY SPIRIT INTACT AFTER SLOW SEPTEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lingering warm weather in September weakened sales for many of the nation's 
biggest store owners reporting results Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry analysts said consumer demand remains strong and the outlook for 
the Christmas season good. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and analysts noted that business recovered this week as temperatures 
fell and consumers began shopping for warmer clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as it got cold in October, sales picked up," said Karen Sack, an 
analyst with Standard & Poor's Corp. "We'll see a lot of September sales were 
deferred until October." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the recession, consumers have bought clothing or household goods only 
when needed. The days of stocking up on winter clothes months before the 
weather turns cold are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said women's apparel sales, which have suffered for more than a year, 
continued to improve September. But the increase wasn't dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Department store companies, which have been taking business away from 
mall-based specialty stores and discount stores, continued to gain market share 
last month, Sack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said sales from stores open at 
least a year rose 6.5% from last September, and total sales were up 22%. The 
figures were off from Wal-Mart's strong pace earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Broadway Stores Inc. said same-store sales increased 4.4% in 
September, and total 1994 same-store sales for the 35 weeks ended Oct. 1 
increased 3.2% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart Corp. said same-store sales rose 2.8%, while overall business was up 
7.9%. Sears, Roebuck & Co. said same-store sales advanced 4.8% and overall 
sales rose 5.4%.

NYSE PRESIDENT WILL BECOME CHAIRMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange named its current president, Richard Grasso, as 
chairman Thursday. He will succeed William Donaldson, who said in July that he 
would not seek a second four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Grasso, 48, was passed over for the top spot in 1991, when Donaldson, now 63, 
was selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion of Grasso is seen as a radical departure for the exchange. 
Grasso has spent his entire 27-year career at the exchange and never graduated 
from college. According to the New York Times, critics did not see him as 
polished enough for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Grasso has been executive vice chairman of the exchange since January, 1991, 
and president and chief operating officer since June, 1988. He becomes the 
first career employee to be named chairman and chief executive in the 200-year 
history of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Grasso is said to have an impressive knowledge of the exchange and to be very 
popular among traders and staff members, and he was widely thought to be the 
leading candidate to succeed Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson formally announced Grasso's promotion when he took the floor of the 
exchange a few minutes before the end of the trading session Thursday. Grasso 
will take over June 1, when Donaldson's term expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking over the cheers of traders, Grasso thanked them in a two-minute 
greeting.

 Window Cord Safety: At least one child a month is accidentally strangled in 
window blind and drapery pull cords, the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
said this week as it announced a program to prevent such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution involves cutting the loop in most window blind cords and affixing 
safety pulls at the two ends.The new design, co-developed with the Window 
Covering Safety Council, replaces the loop with safety tassels. The council 
will provide the tassels free to households, along with installation 
instructions. For more information, call (800) 506-4636. Two-corded window 
coverings sold in stores after Jan. 1 will be manufactured with a safer design. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said window coverings, such as vertical blinds, with 
continuous-loop systems cannot be fixed with tassels but can be fixed with 
tie-down devices.

 Marketing to Latinos: Sears, Roebuck & Co. is stepping up its advertising to 
Latinos this week with a new campaign on the two major U.S. Spanish-language 
television networks.It is Sears' first U.S. ad campaign in Spanish that is not 
tied to specific promotions, the Chicago-based retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new commercials will premiere today on the two leading networks: 
Univision, a unit of Univision Holdings Inc., and Telemundo, part of the 
Telemundo Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign, which runs through late December, will include radio advertising 
in 23 markets, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Martinez, chairman of the Sears Merchandise Group, said Sears plans to

 Child-Resistant Packaging: The Consumer Product Safety Commission has voted to 
require child-resistant packaging of non-prescription anesthetics with certain 
amounts of the drugs dibucaine and lidocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Anesthetics containing the drugs are used to treat sunburn and hemorrhoids and 
are sold as ointments, creams, liquids and sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said the medicines have been blamed for 16 deaths over the past 43 
years. Poison control centers also reported more than 750 cases of children 
swallowing them in 1992, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared with the relatively small number of products containing these 
substances, the number of yearly ingestions of the medicine make the case for 
special packaging more compelling," commission Chairman Ann Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-resistant packaging will be required beginning in April, 1996, for 
anesthetics containing more than half a milligram of dibucaine and more than 5 
milligrams of lidocaine.

FCC PROPOSES PRICE DEREGULATION FOR CABLE; TELEVISION: POLICY WOULD LET FIRMS 
ADD NEW CHANNELS AND CHARGE CUSTOMERS WHATEVER THE MARKET WILL BEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FARHI, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending nearly two years hammering out rules regulating cable 
television prices, federal officials are proposing some price deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission is considering a new policy that would 
enable cable companies to add new channels to their lineups and charge 
customers whatever the market will bear. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which has the backing of FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, would 
mandate that programming that now appears on a cable system continue to be 
price-regulated but that anything new be free of price controls. Consumers 
would have the option of choosing the new package, or "tier," or sticking with 
what they have now. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt's proposal is an attempt to create financial incentives for cable 
operators to add programming. Cable companies have generally not expanded their 
lineups in the past 18 months, a period in which the FCC has passed two 
successive sets of rate rules ordering the industry to cut its prices as much 
as 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable companies say the price rules froze the development of new channels 
because operators could not be assured of profits should they add a channel and 
be restricted in what they could charge for it. They have lobbied Hundt and the 
FCC for months to create a formula that would allow them to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "So long as we protect the existing product, we think this facilitates the 
consumers' and the cable industry's interests," one commission source said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was circulated among the five FCC commissioners Wednesday, and it 
will be voted on within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not entirely clear, however, whether the FCC is permitted to exempt any 
tier of cable programming from price regulation. The 1992 Cable Act passed by 
Congress specifies that the FCC is responsible for ensuring that prices on all 
tiers of programming are "reasonable"; it does not make distinctions between 
existing and new programming. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several people who support the proposal asserted Thursday that the 
FCC was within its authority, given that Congress has provided the FCC wide 
latitude to interpret the cable law. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also unclear how many of the nation's more than 11,000 cable systems 
will be able to expand their lineups even if this proposal gets the FCC's 
blessing. Many operators have filled their systems to capacity and can't add 
channels without taking existing ones off or investing in new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several cable program companies welcomed the proposal Thursday, 
saying it would end some of the uncertainty hanging over the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a far better approach for the FCC than trying to micro-manage every 
decision the (cable) operator makes about programming," said Ed Burakowski, an 
executive with Ovation Inc., an Alexandria, Va.-based company that has been 
trying to gain distribution for a new arts channel. "A lot of us have been 
sitting in the wings waiting for some certainty on these rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Judith McHale, general counsel of Discovery Communications Inc., owner of the 
Discovery and Learning channels, said, "We think something like this would open 
the market up and give operators and consumers more flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed creation of an unregulated "new service tier" is likely to be the 
first in a series of FCC rulings designed to give cable operators financial 
incentives to upgrade their systems. The agency is also considering new pricing 
formulas that would permit cable operators to add channels to their regulated 
tiers, and new accounting rules that would give them the ability to pass on 
some of the costs of rebuilding their systems to subscribers.

 * Music: The Jefferson Airplane has been unable to pull a white rabbit out of 
its hat in federal court in its effort to stop a software company from using a 
"flying toasters" design in a computer screen-saver program. The design is 
similar to one that appeared on the cover of a 1973 album by the group.The 
band, defunct musically since the early 1970s but still in existence as a 
business, did not obtain copyright protection for the album art for "Thirty 
Seconds Over Winterland" and therefore cannot sue for infringement, U.S. 
District Judge Fern Smith ruled in San Francisco. The group sued Berkeley 
Systems over the design of the popular screen-saver program. Berkeley Systems 
argued that it was unaware of the album cover when employees created the 
program. The Jefferson Airplane, one of the most popular rock groups of the 
late 1960s, is known for such songs as "Somebody to Love," "White Rabbit" and 
"Volunteers."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SONY'S SCHULHOF IS JOHNNY ON SPOT -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Sony Pictures Entertainment, the latest rumors have its Japanese parent 
planning a lavish party for the studio's new management team, complete with 
guest appearances by Sony Corp. President Norio Ohga and Sony Corp. of America 
President Michael P. Schulhof. 
</P>
<P>
 One source calls the event, which would take place on the studio's recently 
restored Culver City lot, "a positive experience" and a chance to boost 
executive morale. "There's going to be live music, lots of talent, some 
announcements," the source added. "It's a way of starting over." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at the starting gate are Sony Pictures President Alan Levine and 
Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Cos. Chairman Mark Canton, the team that has 
respectively taken up the business and creative duties of outgoing Chairman 
Peter Guber. Hollywood, which loves the dramatic implications of new 
beginnings, has mostly focused on the challenges they face in reviving the 
studio in short order. But there's also more than a little pressure on 
Schulhof, who was responsible for getting the electronics giant into its 
Hollywood quagmire in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof engineered the purchase of Columbia Pictures (later renamed Sony 
Pictures) five years ago, and it was he who brought in the mismatched 
management team of Guber and his then-partner Jon Peters -- at a cost that will 
ultimately pencil out at more than $1 billion, sources say. Analysts estimate 
that Sony now has more than $7 billion tied up in the studio, meaning a 
dramatic turnaround is required to make it a financial success. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof also faces challenges in his other business. Sony is still searching 
for the next big thing in consumer electronics. Like all entertainment 
companies, it is positioning itself for a place in the new-media world. And 
Sony Music, his most successful unit, is struggling to hold on to its market 
share achieved with acts such as Pearl Jam and Mariah Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof, a former physicist, is supposed to be most comfortable in the realm 
of science. But he doesn't do much to inspire confidence when he provides 
confusing accounts of his own revenue. In an interview last week, he was quoted 
as saying that Sony of America has grown into a $14.5-billion company. The U.S. 
division actually took a $42-million loss on sales of $11.2 billion last fiscal 
year, according to Sony's annual report. When the discrepancy was raised with 
the company, a spokesman said Schulhof was alluding to expected sales for the 
next fiscal year -- which indicates that he has more faith in tomorrow than the 
character "Annie." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he has any clue about entertainment. His background is in 
hardware," said one highly placed critic who asked to remain anonymous." Asked 
how much responsibility Schulhof bears, another remarked, "There's more than 
enough blame there to go around." 
</P>
<P>
 In Schulhof's defense, Sony's American earnings have been battered by the 
Japanese yen's rise against the dollar. Friends also portray him as a newcomer 
to the entertainment world who was taken in and eaten by the Hollywood sharks. 
"He's a sweet guy," said one. "But he's been screwed." 
</P>
<P>
 If that has shaken Tokyo's confidence in their man in America, they aren't 
letting on publicly. Analyst David M. Benda of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo 
says Sony continues to profess support for Schulhof, even though the "U.S. 
operation is regarded as a source of weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof seems to have tacitly acknowledged that weakness by bringing in 
Jeffrey Sagansky, the highly regarded former CBS Entertainment chief, as his 
second in command last month. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sagansky in place, sources expect Schulhof to back off from entertainment 
and focus on broader issues. Sagansky is expected to take up the continuing 
search for a 25% investor in Sony Pictures, and may also try to link Sony with 
a cable, telephone or satellite company. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see promising signs for the U.S. division if Sony Pictures gets its act 
together. Sony Corp.'s annual report points out that sales of electronics rose 
approximately 13% and music sales approximately 22% for the fiscal year ended 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof is also working to smooth out a rocky relationship with Sony Music 
President Thomas D. Mottola. Analysts are watching to see if the division can 
maintain its strength, with market share off from last year and reports this 
week that Michael Jackson's highly touted greatest-hits collection may not be 
ready in time for the crucial holiday sales season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, most of the attention inevitably focuses on Sony 
Pictures. Levine and Canton are said to be promising a quick turnaround in both 
attitude and productivity at the studio in conversations with lawyers, agents 
and other people they do business with. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are still skeptical that they can succeed, given Sony's recent track 
record. But the worst scenario for Schulhof is the failure of another regime, 
since that would bring about even more financial pain and force the company 
into yet another new beginning. "The future is now," said one source. "They 
can't screw it up again."

capture holiday shopping dollars. Jackson is supposed to have already delivered 
the project to Epic Records, but frustrated insiders say he is not fully 
satisfied with every aspect of the package. There is speculation about whether 
Epic will release the project in the first quarter of 1995 or reschedule it for 
later in the year.

COMPANY TOWN; PROFILE; BIG PLANS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it were up to Alberto Alvarado, the Los Angeles office of the Small 
Business Administration would be adequately staffed, efficient and able to 
quickly respond to every loan application it receives, including those from 
minority and female applicants who have historically had problems qualifying 
for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, concedes Alvarado, who was recently named director of the 
federal agency's local office, his operation is not yet able to meet such 
goals. For one thing, he said in a recent interview, the office has not done a 
good job of helping minority and female business owners.  
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are the facts. We have not reached out to those communities, and we 
have to. Under my leadership, that's going to occur," said Alvarado, a 
42-year-old native of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems in the local office, he added, are understaffing and cumbersome 
procedures imposed by the national office. The unwieldy process has long been a 
criticism applied generally to the agency designed to help small businesses 
start up or expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm open to criticism, but I'm also proud of the work this office has done 
and can do," said Alvarado, who managed the Los Angeles office's legal division 
for 13 years before his appointment to the top job in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his priorities, he said, is establishing a more comprehensive plan to 
deal with the SBA's poor track record of helping minority- and female-owned 
businesses. Included in his plan, he said, are increased contacts with business 
owners to seek their ideas on improving service. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Alvarado hosted a minority enterprise development breakfast 
for more than 300 minority entrepreneurs, corporate executives and lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a national level, the SBA wants to double by mid-1995 the amount in loans 
it provides to women and minorities. Last year, both groups combined received 
less than 25% of the $6.4 billion in loans made by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA officials say they believe the agency will reach more eligible minorities 
and women by increasing the availability of loans of less than $25,000, because 
those groups tend to have businesses that qualify for smaller loan amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alberto's broad management skills, experience in complex business and legal 
matters and familiarity with local issues make him uniquely qualified to deal 
with our constituency throughout the Los Angeles community," SBA Administrator 
Erskine B. Bowles said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado, who grew up in Boyle Heights, is a graduate of Yale University and 
Stanford Law School. Before joining the SBA as a staff attorney in 1978, he was 
a clerk for the California Court of Appeals and served as a congressional aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Local business people who have dealt with Alvarado generally give him good 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado's experience will help significantly in resolving some of the Los 
Angeles office's problems, said James Whitney, a senior vice president of 
American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks who has worked with the local SBA 
office since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney said Alvarado improved the office's legal affairs department despite a 
reduction in staff, and he expects the entire local operation to improve under 
his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alberto Alvarado is a star among his peers," Whitney said. "He's lived 
through the problems and knows the things that are needed." 
</P>
<P>
 In his new job, Alvarado heads an office with 56 permanent employees. He will 
oversee the administration of a business loan portfolio of more than $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado said he has requested staff additions. Although the response from his 
superiors has been positive, he said, the SBA may not have the money to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, to ease the burden on his overworked staff, Alvarado said, he is 
looking for ways to further streamline SBA procedures to provide better 
service.

 Visiting Artists to Be Welcomed Back

<P>
 A summer program that allowed out-of-town teen-age artists to stay with local 
families and participate in art-related activities will likely be replayed next 
year, school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more successful than we ever dreamed," district administrative 
secretary Nancy Vaughan said. "I would imagine that once the word gets out, 
this (program) will be very popular next year." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the CREATE program, 14 high school students from Santa Ana, Los

families, taking part in a variety of activities, from pool parties and picnics 
to visiting the summer festivals and holding their own art exhibit at a city 
gallery. 
</P>

 "They're families were very apprehensive to send them down here, which really

ORANGE COUNTY ALMANAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Beach is one of Orange County's oldest cities. Founded in 1901 as 
"Pacific City," the community's name was changed three years later to honor 
Henry Huntington, the famed Pasadena developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington's Pacific Electric "Red Car" Railway had a stop at the base of the 
pier, at Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1920, Standard Oil Co. began extensive drilling along the beaches. The 
result was a forest of derricks and the nickname, Oil City. 
</P>
<P>
 As oil drilling decreased, land values went up and there was more land for 
housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, this little boom town is once again in the state of economic expansion 
and growth as city officials redevelop Main Street. Today

U.S. RETAILERS' HOLIDAY SPIRIT INTACT AFTER SLOW SEPTEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lingering warm weather in September weakened sales for many of the nation's 
biggest store owners reporting results Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry analysts said consumer demand remains strong and the outlook for 
the Christmas season good. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and analysts noted that business recovered this week as temperatures 
fell and consumers began shopping for warmer clothes. "As soon as it got cold 
in October, sales picked up," said Karen Sack, an analyst with Standard & 
Poor's Corp. "We'll see a lot of September sales were deferred until October." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the recession, consumers have bought clothing or household goods only 
when needed. The days of stocking up on winter clothes months before the 
weather turns cold are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said women's apparel sales, which have suffered for more than a year, 
continued to improvein September. But the increase wasn't dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Department store companies, which have been taking business away from 
mall-based specialty stores and discount stores, continued to gain market share 
last month, Sack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said sales from stores open at 
least a year rose 6.5% from last September, and total sales were up 22%. The 
figures were off from Wal-Mart's strong pace earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, are 
considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's strength. They exclude the 
results of newer stores, where sales tend to be unusually high. Same-store 
sales also exclude results from stores closed over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Broadway Stores Inc. said same-store sales increased 4.4% in 
September. Kmart Corp. said same-store sales rose 2.8%, while overall business 
was up 7.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. said same-store sales advanced 4.8% and overall sales 
rose 5.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson Corp. said same-store sales rose 3.3% and overall business was 
up 9.6%. The company's Target discount store division was again its strongest 
performer, while sales at its Mervyn's clothing chain were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 JC Penney Co. said same-store sales at its flagship stores rose 9.3% and that 
total sales, including its drugstore and catalogue operations, rose 8.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 May Department Stores Co. reported a 1.7% same-store sales gain and a 5% 
overall increase.

ORANGE S&L BECOMING PRIVATELY OWNED MORTGAGE FIRM; THRIFTS: LONG BEACH BANK 
TODAY WILL COMPLETE SALE OF DEPOSITS TO HOME SAVINGS. IT PLANS TO GIVE UP S&L 
CHARTER. 
</P>

<P>
 Long Beach Bank, which is actually a savings and loan based in Orange, is 
expected to take a big step today toward its goal of turning in its S&L charter 
and converting to a privately owned mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift is scheduled to complete the sale of its $546 million in deposits 
today to Home Savings of America, the nation's largest S&L.Home Savings is 
paying $12.5 million for the deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings will merge accounts from four branches -- Tustin, Thousand Oaks, 
Pasadena and Beverly Hills -- into nearby Home Savings offices tonight. It will 
continue to operate the two remaining offices in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings will hire 39 Long Beach Bank employees, and 10 others will be 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller thrift will become Long Beach Mortgage Co. and will continue to 
operate 80 loan offices in 14 states, changing the four branches Home Savings 
is abandoning into loan offices as well.  
</P>
<P>
 It also will maintain two other Long Beach loan offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will have 849 employees, including 461 at its headquarters in 
Orange, said Jon Daurio, Long Beach Bank's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The S&L has said previously that it is getting out of the thrift industry 
because federal regulations make the business too expensive and burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the thrift can turn in its charter, though, outside auditors must 
verify that it no longer has any deposits and, therefore, no liabilities that 
the federal government must insure, Daurio said.  
</P>
<P>
 That process should be completed by the end of the year, he said.

 September usually means a boost for clothing retailers as parents buy 
children's back-to-school outfits, adults update their fall wardrobes and 
consumers start making early purchases for the upcoming holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 But that usual seasonal gain never materialized this year for two Orange 
County companies that sell junior women's wear aimed at teen-agers through 
"40-somethings." 
</P>
<P>
 Clothestime Inc., the Anaheim-based off-price retailer, reported Thursday that 
its sales fell by 6% to $27.6 million for the five weeks ended Oct. 1, down 
from $29.5 million for the same period last year. Sales at stores open more 
than a year -- an important retail gauge -- fell by 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wet Seal, which promotes its clothing as fashionable but still affordable, 
hasn't released sales figures for the third quarter. For the second quarter, 
the Irvine-based chain posted a loss of $1.2 million on revenue that fell 13% 
to $31.1 million. Its stock price has stalled since then, languishing at about 
$3.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither company would comment Thursday. Retail industry analysts, however, 
said that both retailers, like other specialty chains catering to younger 
women, are being hurt by the absence of any exciting fashion development, the 
last big wave having been the grunge look. Nothing is trendy enough right now, 
analysts say, to draw customers into stores. 
</P>
<P>
 For many junior shoppers, fashion today means "jeans and beige jackets," said 
Don Murray, an Orange County-based partner with the national accounting firm 
Deloitte & Touche. "Once you buy a pair of jeans and a jacket, how many do you 
need?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stalled sales aren't necessarily an indication of a slow economy, Murray said. 
Younger men are spending relatively freely, he said, for surf wear and other 
casual attire. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Johnson, an analyst with the brokerage Johnson Redbook Service in New 
York, said that Clothestime, Wet Seal and other specialty clothing sellers are 
also being hurt by increased competition from major retailers, such as JC 
Penney. 
</P>
<P>
 "An executive at one (discount) chain told me today that it's a 'perceived 
perception' that you can get better deals at the big chains," Johnson said 
Thursday. "If you go price it out, it isn't necessarily true. But shoppers 
believe it, and that's hurting the (discount) chains." 
</P>
<P>
 But economics also is playing a role, said Kurt Barnard, editor of Barnard's 
Retail Marketing Report, a New Jersey publication that tracks retail sales. 
"Kids today just can't find good, well-paying jobs," Barnard said. "So today 
they're happy if they can (afford to) buy a pair of jeans." A Snag in Clothing 
Clothestime and Wet Seal have seen their stock prices drop amid declining sales 
at young women's clothing shops nationwide. Since October, 1993, Clothestime's 
stock has lost nearly half its value, while Wet Seal's has declined about a 
third. Monthly closing prices:

ARK ENERGY GIVES INITIAL APPROVAL TO BUYOUT BY TENNECO SUBSIDIARY; DEAL: 
HOUSTON-BASED FIRM PLANS TO KEEP THE LAGUNA HILLS COMPANY'S 35 EMPLOYEES AND 
EXPAND ITS OPERATIONS.

 Ark Energy Inc., a 5-year-old developer of cogeneration plants, said Thursday 
that it has tentatively agreed to be acquired by a subsidiary of giant Tenneco 
Inc. for stock worth $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston company's Tenneco Gas unit plans to keep Ark's 35 employees and 
expand Ark's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cogeneration plants create both steam and electrical energy. Plants use 
natural gas to make steam that runs generators, which in turn create 
electricity. Ark sells the electricity to public utilities and the excess steam 
to industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition will give Tenneco Gas, which transports and sells natural gas, 
a 50% interest in two Florida cogeneration projects with a total of 224 
megawatts of generating capacity and an interest in eight other projects in 
various stages of development with a total of more than 950 megawatts of 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ark, named for Noah's Ark, is co-owned by Arnold R. Klann, its president, and 
Leslie C. Confair, its chief operating officer. Each holds the positions of 
co-chairman and co-chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenneco also will form a joint venture with an Ark affiliate, Arkenol Inc., to 
develop environmentally safe methods for disposing of organic waste. Arkenol, 
for instance, is processing the straw from rice harvests in the Sacramento area 
into ethanol for fuel and into sodium silicate for use in a variety of products 
from rubber to soap. 
</P>
<P>
 At other locations, Arkenol combines the steam byproduct of cogeneration with 
its proprietary technology to convert other cellulose refuse, such as paper and 
grass clippings, into ethanol and other specialty chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arkenol is a green company that develops what I like to call biorefineries," 
said Klann, the affiliate's sole owner. "We produce mainly ethanol." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Confair will join the staff of 15 at Arkenol once the sale of Ark 
Energy is completed in about 45 days.

O.C. BRIEFLY: BALDWIN CO. REPORTS 42% INCREASE IN THIRD-QUARTER HOME SALES 
REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home builder Baldwin Co. said Thursday that its revenue from home sales jumped 
42% for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company, based in Newport Beach, said unaudited results 
indicate that it sold 153 homes during the three months ended Sept. 30, 
bringing in revenue of $31.9 million.That compared to $18.5 million in revenue 
from the sale of 82 homes for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The average selling price, however, declined to $208,000 from $226,000, mostly 
because a larger proportion of the sales for the latest quarter were of more 
modestly priced townhomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Co. also had revenue of $29.2 million from land and model-home sales 
for the latest quarter, boosting its total to $61.1 million. That compared to 
total revenue of $21.1 million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of 1994, the company said, it has sold 389 homes for 
revenue of $94.9 million. That compares to 316 homes sold for revenue of $65 
million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin, which sold $155 million in bonds to investors last year, now owns 
about 2,700 lots on which it can build houses and an additional 3,200 lots for 
which it has not yet acquired permits to begin construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1956, Baldwin Co. has built more than 15,000 homes in Southern 
California.

PIONEER FEMALE SURGEON STILL ON CUTTING EDGE; MEDICINE: AT 70 SHE MAINTAINS A 
THRIVING PRACTICE. SHE HAS DEVELOPED ANTI-CANCER SKIN PRODUCTS AND VOLUNTEERED 
HER HELP IN THIRD WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the 1940s, when many people believed women shouldn't become surgeons, 
Martha MacGuffie still wanted to be one. Her dean at Columbia University 
College of Physicians and Surgeons told her no one would train a female 
surgeon, but agreed to write a recommendation for her. 
</P>
<P>
 At each of her job interviews, surgeons chuckled after reading the short note, 
baffling MacGuffie until the fourth interviewer, who had burst out laughing, 
read it to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "To whom it may concern," it read, "this woman is large, powerful and 
tireless." 
</P>
<P>
 MacGuffie got all four jobs. Since then, her admirers say, she has more than 
lived up to those words. 
</P>
<P>
 During her 70 years, she has established a volunteer group to help fight 
disease and death in Africa, run a research laboratory and traveled the Third 
World with relief organizations, all the while maintaining a thriving medical 
practice in which a patient's ability to pay was never an object. Recently, she 
developed a line of skin care products to help prevent skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In her practice of reconstructive and plastic surgery, she cares for the 
terribly injured and burned, the most difficult cases, working in the northern 
New York suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has been the ultimate working mother, raising eight children. She also 
has nine grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no one like her," said Robert C. Macauley, founder and chairman of 
AmeriCares, a New Canaan, Conn.-based nonprofit relief organization with which 
MacGuffie works periodically. "She is a most unusual woman; dauntless and 
fearless, an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Accomplished, compassionate, humble, dedicated, selfless and unstoppable are 
other words used to describe MacGuffie, who has also endured a large measure of 
tragedy: the deaths of two teen-age sons born with a fatal blood disease. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGuffie was the middle daughter of a Passaic, N.J., doctor, surgeon and 
sculptor. Her mother was trained as an opera singer but never practiced her 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGuffie describes her father as the sort of physician "who just took care of 
people whether or not they had money." She frequently accompanied him on rounds 
and watched him during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on she decided on medicine. Her father, she said, acted as if her 
decision was a normal one for the time. For that reason she never had doubts 
about her abilities or felt discrimination in the profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right in the beginning I was an oddity," MacGuffie said. "I think it was 
easier for me then than it is for women today. I wasn't competition to the male 
doctors. I was someone doing something out of my sphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Animals were her first love. As a child, she spent summers in Maine living in 
a tent in the woods with at least a couple of dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a terrible child, socially at least," MacGuffie said. "All I cared 
about was animals." 
</P>
<P>
 A small school for girls in New Jersey turned MacGuffie from a wild 
wood-dweller into a student and cleared the path for her entrance into Cornell 
University. But she still attended class with two beagle puppies in a knapsack 
and a crow on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 During medical school she married a fellow student and had two daughters 
before becoming the first female surgeon to graduate from the college. Later, 
she was as tireless in pursuit of her specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to get her to talk about her career and how it developed is difficult. 
MacGuffie is reluctant to address her achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 But at times, she does allude to how hard it was to balance work and a large 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 With her second husband, also a doctor, MacGuffie had five more children. She 
also adopted her second husband's child from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those years were a blur," MacGuffie said. "There doesn't seem anything that 
was as much work as those kids." 
</P>
<P>
 How was it growing up the child of a whirlwind who was up at 5 a.m., worked 
all day and was in bed reading at 1 a.m.? While her daughters have divergent 
views, it is clear that sometimes MacGuffie's work was hard for them too. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was normal for us was watching her in action," said Dr. Jane Hudson, an 
oncologist. "She tried not to separate her work from her children. The 
tragedies of others became our dinner conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 MacGuffie's adopted daughter, Dr. Harriet Hudson, is more critical. As the 
oldest, much of the burden of raising the younger children fell to her, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was never home," Harriet Hudson said. "To put her in the role of mother 
is stretching it. She didn't have time for us. She was very driven to do her 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 The standing joke in the family, she said, was that when her mother wasn't 
home, the children would always say she was out saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But another daughter, Chris Abrams, speaks of MacGuffie's sense of fun. When 
she could, she would show up at soccer games with a megaphone and pompons or 
surprise her children by appearing on a firetruck in a local parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of MacGuffie's three boys were born with a congenital blood disease, 
Fanconi's anemia, which required frequent blood transfusions. Both contracted 
AIDS through transfusions before anyone really knew what AIDS was, MacGuffie 
said. They died just a year apart, one in 1978 and the other in 1979. One was 
13 and the other 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The night her second son died, her husband left. And about the same time, her 
youngest girl went to college. Despite her busy practice, suddenly there was a 
void in her life she had to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything sort of fell apart. I went from a full house to nothing and I 
headed to Africa," MacGuffie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa had intrigued her as a child, but she had never visited. MacGuffie's 
first trip to Kenya was to study animal problems. Then she visited the region's 
hospitals, which have infant mortality rates and instances of AIDS among the 
world's highest. 
</P>
<P>
 That visit opened up another door for MacGuffie. Upon her return she 
established SHARE, a nonprofit group set up to help bring medical equipment, 
treatment and medical training to eastern Kenya. She also takes young doctors 
there to study AIDS and the diseases it brings. 
</P>
<P>
 Her time is now divided among her medical practice, making presentations about 
SHARE in schools and raising money. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she's not in Kenya or on the road with AmeriCares. Most recently, 
she spent 2 1/2 weeks in Rwanda, where she helped convert an orphanage into a 
hospital for UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 On her most recent trip to Kenya, she and a medical student were pulled out of 
their car and beaten by bandits. AmeriCares chairman Macauley said he offered 
to have MacGuffie evacuated by plane from the local hospital. But she refused.

O.C. THEATER; SHAKESPEARE O.C. LOSES A KEY PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of Shakespeare Orange County's most successful season, which 
artistic director Thomas F. Bradac characterized as "a turning point for us," 
the troupe has lost a key founding member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've left the company, both as a producer and as an actor," Kamella Tate said 
Thursday. "I'm burned out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, 33, said her departure was also prompted by a desire to be "more of a 
maverick," that she wants to break out of the middle-of-the-road orthodoxy that 
tends to dominate regional theaters here and elsewhere. "My own interests are 
getting less and less conventional," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradac and Tate both said the parting was amicable. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did great work for us," he noted. "She's an extremely talented actress, 
plus she's moving into producing and directing. She brings enormous tenacity, 
energy and lots of ideas to everything she does." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate's versatility on stage and off made her a mainstay of SOC, the county's 
only professional classical troupe. During the past three seasons she played 
Regan in "King Lear," Viola in "Twelfth Night," Hermione in "The Winter's Tale" 
and Casca in "Julius Caesar." Perhaps her most memorable SOC role, however, was 
Boracchio in "Much Ado About Nothing," portrayed with deft comic skill as a 
gender-crossed villain. 
</P>
<P>
 The slim, red-haired actress also has played on the Mainstage at South Coast 
Repertory in Costa Mesa where she was Bridget, the crazy stage manager in Alan 
Ayckbourn's "A Chorus of Disapproval," and Karen, the powerful Hollywood 
secretary in David Mamet's "Speed-the-Plow." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see from looking at my resume that I've done a lot of good, 
conventional regional theater," said Tate, who trained at the American 
Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco and made her professional debut at the 
Oregon Shakespeare Festival. "But there are a lot of people doing that out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 While not dismissing her stage work, she said she wants to "craft a life in 
the theater" that goes beyond performance. One of her "immense satisfactions" 
at SOC, she said, came from organizing and implementing two educational 
programs with student interns from Chapman University. (SOC productions run at 
the Waltmar Theatre on the Chapman campus in Orange.) 
</P>
<P>
 One program was designed to give the interns practical experience in the 
theater, largely in technical capacities but also as performers. "Tom (Bradac) 
has always used interns," Tate said. "But this summer they were actually paid. 
They really dug in and amazed me." 
</P>
<P>
 The other program, conducted last spring, reached out to the surrounding 
community as a teaching tool in local high schools. "I created an SOC touring 
program with 10 advanced Chapman students. We hoped to get to 400 kids in the 
schools and we ended up getting 1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 The touring program involved an hourlong presentation using short stories and 
plays (Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," Elmer Rice's "Street Scene"). Excerpts 
were arranged "around themes high-schoolers could relate to," Tate said, "like 
falling in love or falling out of love." 
</P>
<P>
 Her departure from SOC marks the second time a founding member has left the 
3-year-old company. Elizabeth Norment left quietly after the inaugural season. 
The other founding artists -- Carl Reggiardo, Daniel Bryan Cartmell, Michael 
Nehring and Bradac -- have worked consistently as actors and/or directors in 
SOC productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradac said he would hire a production coordinator this winter to fill the 
large vacuum left by Tate.  
</P>
<P>
 He takes her departure philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things usually go in cycles, often in three-year cycles," he said. 
"It's not just burnout. The thinking is, 'I've done this. Now I have to get on 
with my life.' When I worked with Lee Shallat and Kristoffer Tabori at the 
Grove (Shakespeare Festival in Garden Grove), it was about three years for 
each. It was the same thing with Wayne Alexander." 
</P>
<P>
 Shallat and Tabori both went on to lucrative careers in television. Alexander 
since has resumed working for Bradac at SOC where he has been an active leading 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, who also starred at the Grove as Roxanne in "Cyrano de Bergerac" and 
Isabella in "Measure for Measure," said she hopes to continue developing 
educational programs under other sponsors, and that she recently began a pilot 
presentation, called "Teaching Theater," for the Garden Grove Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, despite her maverick intentions, she still has to make a living as 
an actor in middle-of-the-road productions. At the end of the month she leaves 
for Colorado to begin rehearsals for her latest role: Mrs. Cratchit, Tiny Tim's 
mother, in an adaptation of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" at the Denver 
Center Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 But she'll be back in January, she said, to teach an "unconventional 
conservatory-style course" at Chapman University in speech and text analysis.

 It is a voice of unconstrained power and authority, a rampaging storm so 
forceful, so full of raw emotion and energy that it charges a room with 
unshakable electricity. It is a voice possessed of such muscle and abandon that 
it can actually frighten with its intensity, as if the sounds being produced 
were something a bit more than merely human. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ligon is not a name that frequently comes up when discussing the great 
vocalists of the 20th Century, and this is an injustice. But Ligon, lead singer 
with the Mighty Clouds of Joy, has devoted his life to performing the 
sanctified rather than the secular, and so has limited his recognition to fans 
of gospel music and scattered, lucky pop fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the general public largely remains ignorant of Ligon's gift, many pop 
artists have been hip to him for years. The Mighty Clouds of Joy, who sing 
tonight at Orange Coast College, have played and/or toured with the the Rolling 
Stones, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Al Green and Jimmy Buffett.  
</P>
<P>
 Ligon's influence is particularly pervading in the work of Four Tops lead 
singer Levi Stubbs -- who, for all his excellence and reputation for vocal 
sinew, sounds meek when compared to Ligon's fire and brimstone ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Mighty Clouds of Joy started out, we came along with the Four Tops 
and the Temptations," Ligon said in a recent phone interview. "We'd be in a 
town at the same time. They'd come to hear us, and we'd go to hear them. I 
think all the Motown groups liked the Mighty Clouds of Joy, and I think they'd 
borrow things they heard in gospel music, and vice-versa." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clouds were formed in Los Angeles in 1957, began recording for Peacock 
Records in 1962 and hit the road (where they've spent most of their time) in 
1963. Original members Ligon, Elmo Franklin and Richard Wallace remain, with 
Michael McCowan and Wilbert Williams having replaced the deceased Johnny Martin 
and Jimmy Jones in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's style was always frenetic, even by gospel standards; a 
sweat-soaked cyclone of sound so fierce that if the subject matter weren't 
Christianity, they surely would have been accused of being profane by morality 
watchdogs of the '60s. Ligon, in particular, seems to get absolutely lost in 
the passion of the moment, as he shrieks, wails and testifies with a 
heaven-sent zeal.  
</P>
<P>
 "I sum it up the way Mahalia Jackson does," he explained. "She said that 
there's a feeling you can only get from gospel music. Gospel is described as 
spreading good news; you're singing about a feeling you can't get in any other 
kind of music. There's a certain spirit that overtakes you, especially if you 
came up in a religious family, like I did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I compare myself to how Mahalia felt when I sing 'Amazing Grace,' 'Precious 
Lord Take My Hand' -- those great hymns. I couldn't get that feeling singing 
'My baby left me' or 'I got the blues today.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ligon, 58, grew up in Troy, Ala., the product of a gospel-singing father and a 
preacher grandfather.  
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with gospel music in my blood and on my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ligon is also a fan of early hillbilly music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to listen to WLAC all the time when I was a child," he said, referring 
to the radio station out of nearby Montgomery. "Growing up, I heard people like 
Roy Acuff, Little Jimmy Dickens, Red Foley and lots of bluegrass music. On 
WLAC, they played country for a while, then gospel music -- the Soul Stirrers, 
the Fairfield Four, the Golden Gate Quartet, the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Swan 
Silverstones, the Five Blind Boys, the Sensational Nightingales." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Clouds of Joy used the traditional styles of the old-time gospel 
groups as a base but took their sound way beyond anything heard before in 
gospel, with added energy and fervor. The group's funky, unrestrained style is 
designed to appeal to pop and soul fans as well as the gospel faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we do an album, we think of people who like secular music as well as 
gospel and who might buy Mighty Clouds of Joy albums," Ligon said. "When we do 
an album, we try to reach the majority of the people, not just gospel fans. We 
were one of the first groups to record what you call 'contemporary gospel,' but 
we didn't get credit for it, although we really started it. We were doing it 
before Andrae Crouch did it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Crouch remains perhaps the most high-profile, financially successful 
proponent of contemporary gospel, Ligon does himself a disservice in comparing 
their styles. The Clouds remain a raw and exciting attraction, while Crouch 
often leans to popular style. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clouds worked for a month last year with Paul Simon at New York's Felt 
Forum, and, according to Ligon, the musical relationship will continue.  
</P>
<P>
 "He and I are working on a record together; it'll be out on Intersound Records 
in March of 1995, and I'm very excited about it," Ligon said. "He's writing a 
special version of 'Bridge Over Troubled Waters' for me to sing. When we played 
the Felt Forum with him last year, it was packed every day for 28 or 29 days. 
Fantastic!" 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation to perform secular material has always been a carrot in front 
of his nose. But Ligon has stuck to his belief in his own music and succeeded 
on his own terms -- even if he's not the household name he deserves to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll say this: We are die-hard gospel singers," he stated matter-of-factly. 
"Sam Cooke (who began his career with the Soul Stirrers) was a personal friend 
of mine. He rode me around one day in L.A. during his most successful period, 
and said, 'Joe, you have a great voice, man. Why don't you do a secular album?' 
He said, 'Man, look at my career -- I went as far as I could in gospel, and 
look at me now. You could be phenomenal.' He said, 'I love your voice! I have 
my own label; I'll produce you; I'll write songs for you, I'll do everything 
for you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I have to say, that sounded good. But I come from the church -- I'm not 
a perfect person, but I'm a religious-minded, gospel-singing person. So I 
turned it down. I get a feeling singing gospel music that is indescribable. I'm 
devoted, and I'm dedicated. What I get from singing music, you couldn't buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mighty Clouds of Joy sing at 8 p.m. today in the Robert B. Moore Theatre 
at Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. $19. (714) 432-5880.

DAMIAN WOETZEL GIVES BOYS A LEG UP IN SCHOOL 
</P>

<TEXT>

 Damian Woetzel remembers that when he growing up, he was "the only boy in 
ballet classes." 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, in the New York City Ballet's summer school program at Saratoga 
Springs in New York, there were 15 boys.Woetzel, one of NYCB's principal 
dancers and emerging choreographers, had taken over directorship of the program 
from Heather Watts and his first "pet project," he said, had been to increase 
the number of male students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peer pressure being what it is in this country, (boys) have enough 
obstacles," Woetzel said. "Psychologically, (my task was) to make them feel 
ballet is a comfortable thing to do. It shouldn't be odd if you're the only boy 
in a class of 30, but if you can get 15 boys together, it's a lot easier for 
them to feel good about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them look at it artistically; some look at it as a sport, some just 
like to be around the girls. We had them all." BENJAMIN EPSTEIN

MIKE PENNER: SOCCER DETRACTORS DESERVE A GOOD, SWIFT KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I thought the World Cup had succeeded, without the use of electro-shock 
therapy, in helping us get over this irrational fear of any game played without 
using one's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought we learned that soccer was not a threat to the republic, was not 
carcinogenic, was not played only by beady-eyed Communist atheists with hairy 
legs and could be appreciated by the average American sports fan as at least an 
occasional diversion, the way hockey used to be, back when we had hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is our friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer can be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer Can't Make It Here" brayed the headline atop a 50-odd-inch screed that 
appeared in these pages recently, which attempted to shoot down the embryonic 
MLS before it drafted its first player, dusting off the age-old charges and 
inventing a few new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 You know: Soccer is a cute kids game but it bores us sophisticated grown-ups. 
. . . Not enough scoring. . . . What's the deal with the feet? . . . We didn't 
invent it, so it can't be any good, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Essayist's solution, short of banning the sport altogether: Eliminate the 
goalkeeper, since "you don't reach out to America with a defensive game that 
stars goalkeepers," and maybe install a small box on a post that would ring a 
chime whenever the ball is kicked into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans can't relate to games played with goalies? Someone needs to alert 
the ticket takers at Mighty Duck and New York Ranger home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoot the ball into a box hanging from a post? This has been tried before. It 
is called "basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Chimes? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's all the time we have now, thank you, good night. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer fans are the most passionate on the planet, and, as the laws of physics 
might suggest, so are its detractors. How is it that the mainstream American 
media tolerate rhythmic gymnastics and the biathlon every four years -- warm up 
to the luge, even -- yet 90 minutes of soccer can send a sportswriter itching 
and scratching and steaming toward the keyboard, diatribe ready to upload? 
</P>
<P>
 Hell hath no fury like a baseball beat writer assigned to a USA-England 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 I admit, I used to be a skeptic. My interest in soccer was Olympic-sized -- 
once every quadrennial was fine. I'd pay loose attention to World Cup results, 
watch the highlights, try not to sneeze before the United States was 
eliminated, read up on English hooligan developments and that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been to see the Surf and the Salsa and it didn't translate. Everything 
about those games seemed minor league and we are, after all, living in Big Time 
Sports Land. Last year, I described a APSL championship match between the Salsa 
and the Colorado Foxes as "trash sports." I received letters, labeling me as 
just one more arrogant American soccer basher. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything changed with the 1994 World Cup, as friends keep reminding me when 
I ask if they caught that tape-delay of Liverpool-Newcastle on Prime Ticket. I 
spent two full months with the sport this summer, covered 11 games, watched 
dozens more on television and am now seriously afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gheorghe Hagi hooked me. This is more than I'd prefer to announce in public, 
but what can I say? Hagi, a stocky, rather swarthy, midfielder from Romania, 
did things with a soccer ball I never imagined possible. Whipping it to his 
teammates like some no-hands Magic Johnson, booming 35-yard sliders that bend 
left, swerve right and then tuck themselves into the top far corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Where had this game been all my life, and where could I get more? 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with (soccer) as I was later to fall in love with women: 
suddenly, inexplicably, uncritically, giving no thought to the pain or 
disruption it would bring with it," Nick Hornby writes in "Fever Pitch," an 
hilarious account of life as a fan of the English club team Arsenal, and one of 
the best sports books I have ever read. 
</P>
<P>
 I laughed when I first read that passage. Now, as the soccer magazines jam our 
mail slot and the videocassettes of English and Dutch league games pile up next 
to the TV, I can commiserate. Played at its highest level, the game is as 
addictive as caffeine. Corner kicks that land on a dime, flying headers, 
scrambles in front of the goalmouth, Baggio dribbling through a picket line of 
startled defenders -- sure beats watching Gary Bettman's and Bob Goodenow's 
talking heads on the 11 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MLS has blown it anywhere, it's here, in the no-baseball, no-hockey 
zone of early October. America's new professional soccer league should have 
been ready to go when the European leagues kick off -- late August -- ready to 
climb into the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Alan Rothenberg spends his time sweating out an April start-up date 
with only seven unnamed franchises on the docket, begging the rival APSL to 
bail him out and make it an even dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer can make it here if it gets the right players (some marquee 
internationals, the best Americans), promotes them as major league (no 
handbills, please), opens with reasonable expectations (play the games at Titan 
Stadium, not the Coliseum) and sells the sport instead of the agenda of a few 
attention-hungry stuffed shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the not-enough-scoring charge, how about that Ram game last Sunday? 
Two-nothing at halftime, 5-0 in the fourth quarter, 8-5 on the final scoreboard 
-- and not a goalkeeper in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, if they just eliminated the defenses, pro football might make it 
here.

IT'S A REAL SHOOTOUT AT SHOOTING GUARD; LAKERS: THERE CAN'T BE ROOM FOR 
CHRISTIE, PEELER, JONES, THREATT AND SMITH, CAN THERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers arrived a few days ago, preparing for another training camp at the 
University of Hawaii and making sure to reset their watches. They're now on 
decision time. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue that was in the forefront the second half of last season, that was 
compounded on draft day, that was lingering the entire summer, must now be 
confronted. The shootout at shooting guard starts this morning amid the 
two-a-day workouts, a battle involving five of the 16 players, among them 
injured Doug Christie. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are more significant than who gets the only spot in the opening 
lineup still up for grabs. In this case, losers might well be leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Peeler? The pseudo incumbent after having started all 30 of his 
appearances during an injury-riddled second season will challenge for No. 1 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Jones? First-year Coach Del Harris likes that he can play some small 
forward, but the rookie may be busy in the starting lineup in the backcourt if 
he is as advertised -- an exciting slasher on offense and a factor on defense. 
Look at it this way: The Lakers took him with their first lottery pick, even 
though they already had four shooting guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedale Threatt? Streaky or not, he might still be the club's best perimeter 
shooter, a bigger factor than ever with the three-point line coming in. That he 
is a dependable backup point guard at a time when the only other person behind 
Nick Van Exel is undrafted rookie Trevor Ruffin makes the veteran even more 
valuable. Then again, he might be more valuable still to a championship 
contender looking for a third guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Smith? Someone has to play defense on a team that finished 21st in the 
league in shooting percentage allowed. No Laker guard does it better, at least 
until Jones proves otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie? He has been braced to pull the short straw since late April. Reports 
from New York are that the Lakers and Knicks have had trade talks, but other 
teams are probably interested in someone who is 24, athletic and versatile 
enough to play shooting guard and small forward and, in some situations, point 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aug. 24 surgery to remove calcium deposits on his left ankle will probably 
sideline him through all of camp and move him onto the injured list for the 
start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of competition," Executive Vice President Jerry West said. "We 
like the rookie a lot. Anthony Peeler is healthy again. I think Tony Smith 
played well when he got the minutes. There are a lot of possibilities, but we 
think someone will make the decision for us by the way they play in camp." 
</P>
<P>
 And someone might get traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that, obviously, we have to look at that situation very 
closely," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Threatt, the 33-year-old who joined first- and second-year players at a 
mini-camp last week to get a jump on learning Harris' offensive sets: "It's 
just preseason, so something can still definitely be done. Some guards on this 
team can start in other systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond shooting guard, with Elden Campbell, Vlade Divac, Cedric Ceballos and 
Van Exel mortal locks at the other positions, the lesser showdowns remain: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Antonio Harvey, the find of last year's camp, versus rookie Anthony Miller, 
a second-round pick by Golden State who was traded to the Lakers a few days 
after the draft, for end-of-the-bench power forward. Both don't figure to 
stick. Best rebounder wins? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Van Exel, the quick point guard, versus super-quick Ruffin. Van Exel will 
start and Ruffin, a good ballhandler despite playing mostly shooting guard at 
Hawaii, has a good chance to make the team as his backup. Watching them burn 
rubber during scrimmages could become the most exciting matchup of camp. Laker 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have only 16 players -- 15 considering that Doug Christie will only 
be watching -- in what Del Harris said is the smallest NBA camp he has ever 
had. "We need to start right in coaching the players that are going to be 
playing in the games," he said. "We're not developing a farm team and we're not 
trying to develop players for the CBA. We've got a new coach, we've got a team 
that I think is ready to put a bad year behind them, and the best way to do 
that is to get right with the program from Day 1." . . . The only sure-fire 
goner among the 16 is Kendrick Warren, a rookie small forward from Virginia 
Commonwealth. . . . George Lynch has switched from uniform No. 24 to No. 30.

ONCE AGAIN, ROBERTS IS PLAYING FOR SCALE; CLIPPERS: CENTER IS WELL OVER 300 
POUNDS AFTER TENDON SURGERY, AND BAYLOR ISN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanley Roberts, the Clippers' big man, might be the team's biggest 
disappointment when training camp opens today at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-foot center, who has battled a weight problem throughout his career, 
ballooned to more than 300 pounds while recuperating from Achilles' tendon 
surgery last December. 
</P>
<P>
 How much does Roberts weigh now? 
</P>
<P>
 "He weighs too much, that's what he weighs," said General Manager Elgin 
Baylor, who declined to reveal Roberts' exact weight. "You can quote that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers sent Roberts to the Duke weight-loss clinic this summer, 
he's overweight and out of shape and won't be able to participate in the 
rigorous workouts that new Coach Bill Fitch has planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are frustrated because, they say, they have done everything 
except wire Roberts' jaw. They have sent Roberts, who is due to earn $3 million 
this season, several letters threatening to suspend him without pay if he is 
not fit to play by their season-opener Nov. 4 against the Portland Trail 
Blazers in Yokohama, Japan. Under the collective bargaining agreement, they can 
take no disciplinary action against him until the start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed in Stanley," Baylor said. "We've done everything that 
we can possibly do to help Stanley and try to get him ready for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to Stanley. Stanley has to make the commitment. There's no reason 
Stanley should be as overweight and as out of shape as he is. There's no 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are upset that Roberts didn't begin playing basketball until a 
few weeks ago. Although the tendon has healed, Roberts now has bursitis in his 
right heel, which has slowed his progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers maintain that Roberts hurt his heel because he tried too rush 
himself into shape instead of easing back into basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say he couldn't do anything all summer because of his Achilles' . . . he 
could eat," Baylor said. "There are a lot of things he could have done to keep 
his body in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 A junk-food junkie, Roberts was put on a fat-free diet of 1,800 calories a day 
after entering the Duke clinic on July 10. He left after a week because he was 
bored, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't adapt very well," he said. "When I was first there I didn't lose 
any weight because I wasn't into the program." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Duke, then left again because of personal problems. Roberts 
said he couldn't go to physical therapy because his driver's license had been 
suspended. Baylor said that Roberts' therapist was located across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 After Roberts returned to Duke, he said he had an easier time because former 
Clipper forward John Williams and Washington Bullet center Kevin Duckworth were 
also there, undergoing treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the Duke program, it was real good," Roberts said. "I wish I could go 
back a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who would not say what he weighs, hopes to be fit by the start of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to be ready by the start of the season, if they don't strike," 
Roberts said. "And the Achilles' should be able to take some pressure to where 
I could play at least half of a game. If I'm not ready to go, I'll be out there 
trying, at least." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts has been working out with Clipper trainer Keith Jones, who plans to 
have Roberts run in a pool to lessen the impact on his heel. 
</P>
<P>
 "His condition isn't what we expect and certainly not what we want, but it's 
not a lost cause by any means," Jones said. "He knows what he's got to eat, now 
we've just got to get him on some heavy, heavy exercise, so he can help us when 
we get started." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said he has been frustrated by the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how frustrating this is," he said. "With the weight problem 
and then with the Achilles' going out on me, it seems like one thing is always 
the reason that I can't get to the point where I want to be. I wish I could 
have come in in a lot better condition. I wish I was ready to go. I know Fitch 
is going to be on me and Elgin's going to be on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream last season was going to the All-Star game, and 14 games into the 
season, snap (he was injured). My dream this season was making up for it, but 
unfortunately, I'm not ready to get back out there and bang yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to start living up to my potential and living up to my expectations. 
I'm tired of everybody talking about the weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be the man in L.A. I want to be the next Magic or the next Kareem. 
I want to be the foundation for L.A. When everybody thinks L.A, I want them to 
think Stanley Roberts." Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Tony Massenberg, signed as a free agent in June, tore his groin muscle 
while working out at UCLA on Tuesday and isn't expected to participate in 
drills. He is listed as day to day. . . . New Coach Bill Fitch plans to close 
workouts to the media for the first weekend of training camp.

TOP OF THE WORLD; GABRIEL AND RAFAEL RUELAS TOOK DIFFERENT ROUTES TO THEIR 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a piece of mountaintop peeking over the clouds below, the Ruelas brothers 
-- bound by blood, sport and now, by championships -- are together again. 
</P>
<P>
 In a gym, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael, the lanky International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, is in 
the ring stalking a sparring partner as he prepares for his title defense 
against Billy Schwer in Hong Kong on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel, the newly crowned World Boxing Council junior-lightweight champion, 
has just driven up from Sylmar and is watching his younger brother's dark eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Rafa likes to prove," Gabriel says with a smile. "He feels that he 
has to prove more to people because of the way he is, because of his physical 
look. Like when we started boxing, my 
</P>
<P>
 sisters, my family, they didn't want him to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same with selling candy. I think I was the first one that started selling 
candy, and I told him, 'I'll give you the money and you do the homework.' But 
it was a challenge for him, and he went and he was the best candy seller. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be a challenge for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me, I think I have more natural talent. I think he works harder than I do. I 
work hard, but I do things in the ring that it's like I'm not even trying to 
do, but I anticipate something and I do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers -- separated by only 10 months -- have been packaged as a team 
from the beginning. They came to the United States from a small ranch in the 
Mexican state of Jalisco together to live with a sister, and, this year, in 
spectacular action bouts, have won world titles together. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gabriel was training for his title bout against Jesse James Leija, Rafael 
joined him here. Now, with Rafael at work, Gabriel has left his girlfriend and 
son behind to join Rafael, at least for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 As they pose for a camera on a sofa with trainer Joe Goossen, Gabriel cannot 
help but tease Rafael about people thinking that Rafael is the older of the 
two. Rafael shrugs, like somebody who has heard this line of humor before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 13 other brothers and sisters, and I love them, but I could be without 
them," Gabriel says. "Rafa, I don't know what it would feel like if he wasn't 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I am older (24 to 23), I have never thought about me being older 
than him. Because we're so close in age. I'm sure he doesn't look at me as the 
older brother. We're like the same age, and in a way, the same person." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story has been told often of how the brothers appeared on the boxing scene 
seven years ago: One day in 1984, 13-year-old Gabriel showed up at the North 
Hollywood gym his brother Juan trained at, trying to sell candy. Gabe liked 
what he saw, and asked Goossen if he could stay and be a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen agreed, and Rafael, though much skinnier and far more successful at 
school, decided he wanted to be a fighter too. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, it was clear that although they came as a pair, they were hardly a 
matched set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gabriel is such a free spirit that you have to keep directing him and 
redirecting him, and once you get him pointed in the right direction, he goes 
out and does it," Goossen says. "Rafael is almost like, wind him up and go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafael is much more conservative. Gabriel will go to the gym and he'll leave 
sweat shirt after sweat shirt behind, his shoes, jackets, and he could care 
less, he'll just go out and buy a new one. But that borders on insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafael, he wouldn't misplace a shoelace. He's much more meticulous and 
conservative with what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a decade later, Rafael is still skinnier, Gabriel is still 
more carefree, they are still with Joe and his brother, Dan, the promoter, and 
they are quickly becoming two of the most marketable fighters in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may still be the fight of the year, Rafael won his title in February 
in a war of attrition with then-champion Freddie Pendleton. Ruelas was knocked 
down twice in the first round but never wavered from his swarming attack style, 
beat down Pendleton and came back to win a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sept. 17, a sneering, scowling Gabriel overpowered the highly regarded 
Leija from the opening bell, flying around the ring and eluding Leija's better 
shots on his way to an easy, flashy decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both appeal to all kinds of fans," Goossen says. "Some like the 
brutalizing attack of Rafael's. Some like this kind of left-field style of 
Gabriel's, where he kind of wings it as he goes along." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers have fought on more than 20 fight cards together, and, although 
Gabriel has said he'd prefer not to fight on the same night as his brother, the 
plans are to join them in twin title defenses sometime in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers recognize that their fighting styles mirror their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Differences between us? It's night and day," Gabriel says. "He likes to 
study. He reads books. Me, I never liked any of that stuff. In school, he 
always hung out with the ones that got A's, and me, the ones that got F's. I 
didn't graduate. He graduated a year earlier than he was supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rafael: "I guess it was evident in the fight against Azumah Nelson, where 
Gabriel sort of slowed down a little bit (and lost a decision in 1993). He had 
it in him to keep going, but I don't know what it was, maybe he just felt 
content. He fell into a comfort zone instead of pushing to go above and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always pushing to go beyond where I'm at right now. Even though I feel 
great that I've gotten to where I am, I don't want to stay where I'm at. I want 
to keep going up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like that at school. And when we were both aiming to learn English, I 
was always the one who pushed myself more. And I'm thankful I've been very 
successful at everything I've pursued so far." 
</P>
<P>
 For Rafael, the future beyond Hong Kong almost certainly includes a showdown 
with Oscar De La Hoya sometime in 1995, and if he wins that, his style and 
growth potential could bring him into Julio Cesar Chavez financial territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm the best there is at 135 (pounds)," Rafael says. "I'm here, 
sitting on the throne, and I'll wait for whoever comes up to me. And then we'll 
get it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel, so fresh from winning his belt, is much more comfortable talking 
about the past, about all the sacrifices made, the broken right elbow he 
overcame in 1990, the pitfalls avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't just wait for destiny to happen, we made it happen," Gabriel says. 
"And it cost us a lot. A lot of things, if I had to do it over again, hmmm, I'd 
think about it. Because I missed out on a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised how seriously we took it when we were amateurs. It's hard to 
take it so seriously when you're a kid, but we did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a lot of friends. I lost most of my friends when I started 
boxing, because they get tired of asking you to go to eat or to a party and 
they know the answer's going to be, 'No, I'm training, I'm fighting.' And they 
get tired of even asking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we missed out on being kids because we always trained. Even though we 
were 12 and 13, we trained like professionals. We never celebrated Christmas 
until, like, two years ago. We didn't know what to do. We were, like, I know 
you put up a tree, but what else? 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't be complaining, I'm a world champion now. But again, I know it 
only gets harder. At least I know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael sees it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think about it," he says of the sacrifices. "But you have to look 
at the other side. We're experiencing things that very few people in the world 
get to experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are, we come from a very small ranch, and we're now world champions 
and thousands and thousands of people watch us fight and they look up to us. 
It's just a great feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at that side of it. We're still young. And if we continue to 
succeed, we'll earn a lot of money. . . ." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Heavyweight prospect Jeremy Williams is the latest to join the Ruelas camp, 
and although his cockiness wouldn't seem a quick fit with the brothers and Joe 
Goossen, he strolls around the Big Bear house comfortably and in obvious 
respect of what the Ruelases have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're at a point in their lives where I want to be," Williams says. "These 
two guys are some of the coolest guys I ever met in boxing. Joe's instilled a 
lot of principles and morals in those two guys, and they just exude it." 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen says that by the time he got them, both boys already had all the heart 
and courage they needed, instilled by early mornings on the ranch working with 
their father. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were 7 years old, and we first got here, we didn't really have 
parents," Gabe says. "We didn't see our parents for seven-eight years after we 
left them. It was really hard to come up here to the States. So I kind of 
forgot about them. We didn't have pictures. I would cry at night because I 
wouldn't remember (his mother's) face. And our sister, the one who was taking 
care of us, she had to work all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Once they started boxing, Goossen acted as a surrogate parent and guardian, 
going to school when Gabe got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always took our side," Gabe says happily now. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they started boxing, everything else came naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing is our life," Gabe says. "We put our whole body and soul into boxing, 
and look what happened."

REARMING THE PATRIOTS; QUARTERBACK DREW BLEDSOE HAS IMPRESSED EVERYONE EXCEPT 
NEW ENGLAND'S COACH, BUT HE IS ALSO COMING AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was a phenom at Washington's Walla Walla High, where he threw 25 touchdown 
passes as a senior. He was a star at Washington State, where he threw for 476 
yards in a single game. He was the NFL's No. 1 draft choice in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He has size. He has poise. He has a great arm. He has a $14.5-million 
contract. And, in only his second year with the New England Patriots, Drew 
Bledsoe is putting up some impressive statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 What more could a 22-year-old guy like Bledsoe want? A little praise from his 
coach would be nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't hold your breath, Drew. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody ever envisioned Bill Parcells as a teacher in a charm school. Least of 
all Bill Parcells. As coach of the Patriots, just as was the case when he was 
coach of the New York Giants, Parcells is tough, gruff and demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 His style won him two Super Bowls in New York and he's not about to change 
now. Not when he can see the potential in a Patriot team that is rising again 
eight years after reaching the Super Bowl and six years after posting its last 
winning record. Not when Parcells can see the potential in a quarterback who 
suddenly has heads all over the NFL turning in the direction of Foxboro, Mass., 
for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into Sunday's game at Foxboro against the Raiders, Bledsoe has thrown 
11 touchdown passes in five games, second in the NFL to Dan Marino's 14; has 
league-leading totals in passes with 229, completions with 138 and yardage with 
1,751, and has connected on 60.3% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty good, eh Bill? 
</P>
<P>
 "The main difference between this year and last year is at least now, he knows 
he doesn't know," Parcells said. "Last year, he didn't even know he didn't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Parcells took a look at his 6-foot-5, 233-pounder and told the 
Boston Globe, "How far is he from where he should be? Well, he's in Rhode 
Island and he should be in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bledsoe had the inevitable bad day that all rookies have, throwing five 
interceptions against the Pittsburgh Steelers and failing on a quarterback 
sneak from the one-foot line as time ran out in a game New England lost, 17-14, 
Parcells asked reporters afterward, "How can a guy 6-5 not gain a yard?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the privacy of the locker room, he told Bledsoe, "You'd better get your 
butt going because Heath Shuler's coming out in the draft. If you don't, you're 
just going to be another guy who got picked high who wasn't doing very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it hasn't worked out quite that way. Bledsoe has: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Passed for 421 yards in a single game, the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Already produced four 300-yard games, tying the club record set by Steve 
Grogan in 1976, and the season isn't even one-third over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A passing yardage total that is more than double the total of eight other 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A sixth-place standing on the Patriots' all-time passing list after only 18 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all that has to impress Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's matured," the coach said. "He's making better decisions. He's more 
confident. He's managing the game a little bit better and he has a little more 
firepower around him to work with than he did last year. All of those things 
contribute. But he's only played (18) games, so there's a lot of room for 
improvement. But he's working at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let Parcells fool you. Underneath the stern-taskmaster exterior is a man 
filled with pride at what Bledsoe has accomplished in such a short time. Proof 
of that can be found in the mere fact that the Patriots spend so much time in 
the air these days. They are averaging 342.2 yards passing a game, highest in 
the NFL. This under Parcells, a man known to favor ball control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been kind of funny," Bledsoe said. "When I was drafted last year, one of 
the questions I was asked most often was, 'How do you feel? You're going to 
come in here and hand the ball off 35-40 times a game and not be able to throw 
it anymore.' Ever since I've been here, we've been throwing the ball a bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 What a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I look for in a quarterback is that he can't be sensitive," 
Parcells said. "If they're thin-skinned, then they can't play here." 
</P>
<P>
 And how has Bledsoe's skin held up under Parcells? 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely wasn't comfortable when I first came in," Bledsoe said. "He's 
an intimidating type of guy. He has a very strong personality. He's loud and 
all that. When you first come in, he can be pretty intimidating, but I think 
we're starting to develop a good working relationship. We're able to 
communicate pretty well now. I think the reason is because my level of play has 
stepped up. I've been able to work and play at a level closer to what he 
expects from me. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me a couple of times I looked like a high school quarterback. It's 
one of the ways he tries to motivate you. He'll get down on you and say all 
kinds of things to see how you come back, to see if you come back fighting. I 
take his comments seriously, but I also try to focus on the message and not the 
delivery. I try to take everything positively." 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe has even been spotted answering his coach back on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think he's wrong, I say something," Bledsoe said. "The problem is, 
he's not wrong very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Bledsoe gave one of the most dramatic demonstrations of his 
growth as a quarterback. Against the Green Bay Packers, he drove his team 45 
yards in 11 plays, enabling Matt Bahr to kick the game-winning 33-yard field 
goal with four seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drew told us what was going to happen when we were in the huddle," offensive 
lineman Bob Kratch said. "He said, 'OK, let's play ball. We move the ball down 
the field and then we kick the field goal.' And we did it just like that. For a 
young kid like that to take charge, you have to take your hat off to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you're Bill Parcells.

MIKE DOWNEY: THE WAY THE GAME SHOULD BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We would like to encourage those adversely affected by the cancellation of the 
Major League Baseball season -- from concessionaires to administrative staff -- 
to send their resumes in, and we will try in any way we can to put them to 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 When I saw this written offer from the general manager of the minor league 
Long Beach Barracuda, it made my heart glow. Somewhere out there, men were 
still playing baseball. Somewhere out there, somebody was worrying over the 
welfare of all those laid-off or fired baseball employees not rich enough to go 
golfing all day. And guess what? Somewhere out there, somebody was actually 
doing something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I gave the general manager a call to pay my respects to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, her. 
</P>
<P>
 How it came to pass that Paula Pyers became the top front-office exec of a 
double-A ballclub is a pretty interesting story in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyers, 28, is a former basketball player and teammate of Cheryl Miller from 
USC. Later she went to law school and worked with football and hockey clientele 
for a while, doing intern legal work with the Raiders and working with IMG 
super-agent Michael Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she's the chief Barracuda -- do your own lawyer jokes here -- for one of 
the eight new franchises in the wholly independent Western League, which will 
begin play next May, up the coastline from Long Beach all the way to British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball the Way It Was Meant to Be," is the Barracuda's ad campaign. (Right, 
and thank you.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices $7, $5 and $3, for example. In some baseball leagues, three 
bucks won't buy you an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Player tryouts will begin in January, throughout the circuit. Ticket requests 
-- and job applications -- should go to 643 Sports, Inc., at 249 East Ocean 
Blvd., Suite 1020, Long Beach 90802, with, naturally, only so many available. 
Even so, this is not all that Pyers and associates are offering. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're offering," she said, "is low prices, family entertainment and good 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good ball sounds good," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any ball," Pyers reminded me. 
</P>
<P>
 Point taken, counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "We're not looking to take business away from the Dodgers or 
Angels. Far from it. We're just a nice alternative for people who don't care to 
go that far." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that roughly 380,000 people reside within Long Beach's city 
limits, or only around 80,000 fewer than in Kansas City and 50,000 fewer than 
Pittsburgh, hey, the town is right and the time is right. Long Beach is already 
the Little League capital, remember. It is ready now to go bigger league. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like the new Northern League, which got going in 1993 and drew more than 
700,000 fans in its first year, the Western League will have a 90-game schedule 
through Labor Day, followed by a championship series between division leaders. 
No team is affiliated with any single major league organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Wolff, who once owned the Durham Bulls, helped organize the Northern 
League. So did Bruce Engel, who snapped up the franchise in Duluth, Minn., for 
himself. Engel had helped save baseball in Erie, Pa., after its long tenure as 
a big league farm club had been severed. He saw firsthand how much fun life in 
the minors could be. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Veeck, son of Bill, made it more fun. At home games in St. Paul, where 
he's in charge, customers could get their shoulders rubbed by Sister Rosalind, 
a Roman Catholic nun and licensed masseuse. Pedro Guerrero, the former Dodger 
slugger, played in the Northern League last summer at 38. So did old Bull 
Durham himself -- Leon, the ex-Cub. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miles and Bruce and Mike Veeck, they made baseball fun again, the way it's 
supposed to be," said Pyers, who became intrigued when she heard about the new 
league forming out West. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't the only woman so inclined. One of the Western League franchises 
based in Washington state also is being run by one, Suzan Bond. There will be 
three teams up there, plus one in Surrey, B.C., along with a Southern Division 
made up of California clubs in Long Beach, Palm Springs, Salinas and Sonoma 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't what Pyers pictured herself doing when she was playing pro 
basketball in Switzerland or after she had graduated magna cum laude from law 
school. She was captain of USC's 1988 team, then went to Zurich as a 
player-coach and averaged 30 points and nine assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she's general manager of a pro baseball club, same as her Palm Springs 
counterpart, Al Campanis of Dodger lore. 
</P>
<P>
 As executive vice president of 643 Sports, Inc., she and fellow 
owner-directors Jim Agate, Dr. Robert Bedrossian, Chris Gibbs, Howard Homan and 
William Scripps are already making an impact, beginning with their recent 
successful "Name the Team" contest. Everybody at 643 Sports wants baseball back 
on the field where it belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-four-three? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right," Pyers said. "As in double play."

UNION WORKS UP COUNTEROFFER; HOCKEY: NO TALKS SET TODAY, BUT SALARY 
RESTRICTIONS STILL TROUBLE PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., packed his 
calculator and returned to Toronto, where he was preparing a counterproposal to 
the two plans he had rejected Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No negotiations were held Thursday, Day 6 of the delay ordered by NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman, and no talks were scheduled for today. Negotiators 
instead added up numbers to promote the merits of their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed the NHLPA's new proposal would impose levies of 6% on the gate 
receipts of the top 16 revenue-earning clubs and 6% on every payroll dollar 
paid by clubs. That's an increase of half a percent in each rate from its 
previous proposal, which it said would generate $40 million. NHL officials have 
said the proceeds would not be near that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The last plan presented by the NHL included a 3% levy on the gate receipts of 
the top 16 revenue-earning clubs, the first time it had offered to put a levy 
on gate receipts. In addition, a levy of half a percent would be imposed per 
million dollars of payroll, up to $14 million. After that, the levy would be 5% 
per $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically the levy could reach 125%, but Jeff Pash, the NHL's vice 
president and general counsel, said no payroll last season was high enough to 
trigger that penalty. He said the plan would generate $20 million-$25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pash, the Kings -- whose payroll last season was $16.208 million 
according to the Hockey News -- would have been assessed $2 million under this 
plan. Under the union's last proposal, they would have paid $2.237 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about possible restrictions on salaries still troubled players after 
seeing the last two NHL proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've reshuffled it a bit, but I still see it as a salary cap," said Kelly 
Miller of the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Pash said a union proposal of two 6% levies wouldn't be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not think it was designed to move things forward," he said. "We've 
worked very hard to try and address their objections. They said it was critical 
that there be sharing of revenue and gate receipts, and we have. That's 
revolutionary for this league. It's never been done before." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the NHL still has room for compromise, he said, "Yes, there's 
flexibility. Yes, we're willing to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 King General Manager Sam McMaster said, "The players' association has in mind 
they just want to continue the status quo and they don't want to do anything 
about the issues surrounding the league. I want to play hockey, but I want 
owners to be able to pay the bills."

FEHR'S BACK-CHANNEL TALKS YIELD NOTHING; BASEBALL: MEETING WITH OWNER OF THE 
ROCKIES PRECEDES THOSE NEXT WEEK THAT MAY BE LAST BEFORE SALARY CAP IS 
IMPLEMENTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With baseball's collective bargaining negotiations expected to resume next 
week, union leader Donald Fehr and owner Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies 
continued their back-channel search for a middle ground during private meetings 
in Denver on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, returning to New York from a Wednesday speaking engagement in Los 
Angeles and accompanied by his brother, Steve, a Kansas City lawyer, said, "It 
was strictly a preliminary assessment of where we are," adding that nothing 
substantive had developed. 
</P>
<P>
 McMorris, who had been among the most active owners in trying to keep 
communications alive through behind-the-scenes meetings with the union before 
the season was canceled on Sept. 14, was more enthusiastic but acknowledged, 
"No credible plan emerged that can be laid on the table next week." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, "We had a positive and thorough exchange of ideas on how 
best to get the talks started again, and hopefully that will happen by the end 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still hopeful that we can find something both sides can live with." 
</P>
<P>
 McMorris said his was probably a last-ditch attempt before the owners 
unilaterally implement the salary-cap proposal, a move expected before the end 
of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that among the concepts discussed briefly was a plan that owner Peter 
Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles presented to Fehr on Sept. 24 and to acting 
Commissioner Bud Selig in Milwaukee on Wednesday. Under the Angelos plan, the 
union would apply a 3% tax to player salaries, generating about $30 million in 
addition to the $70 million that the big-market clubs are prepared to share 
with the small-revenue teams through the proposal now on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angelos plan would also eliminate salary arbitration in return for earlier 
free agency. It does not include a cap, but Angelos has theorized that the $100 
million available to the small markets would help put them on even footing with 
the successful teams and could best be used to finance new stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos is something of a maverick among the owners and it is doubtful whether 
the majority would be enthusiastic about an agreement that does not include a 
cap, but Selig said he is receptive to any ideas, that the owners are not 
committed, as the union insists, to implementation, and that the Angelos plan 
would be run through the computers and presented to the full ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he would meet with his staff in New York today to weigh the owners' 
request for a 45-day freeze on contract signings and a delay in the start of 
free-agent filing from Oct. 15 to Nov. 30. Management attorneys, in a letter to 
the union Thursday, also asked the players to waive the anti-collusion 
provisions of the current agreement during the proposed freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fehr and McMorris were meeting in Denver, baseball's antitrust exemption 
was under attack again, this time in Florida, where that state's Supreme Court, 
in a 5-1 decision, ruled that the exemption applies only to the reserve system, 
not the overall business of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling permits Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth to continue to 
investigate whether National League owners conspired in 1992 to keep the San 
Francisco Giants from moving to St. Petersburg.

BOONE EXPECTED TO SUCCEED MCRAE AS ROYALS' MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Angel catcher Bob Boone is expected to be named manager of the Kansas 
City Royals today or Saturday, succeeding the recently fired Hal McRae. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone would not comment when reached at his Orange County home on Thursday, 
but sources said he had won an organizational tug of war over Chicago Cub coach 
Tony Muser, and that the Royals expected to hold a news conference before the 
end of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, 46, spent the 1994 season as a bench coach with the Cincinnati Reds, 
for whom his son, Bret, played second base. He managed the Oakland Athletics' 
triple-A Tacoma affiliate in 1992 and '93 after a 19-year playing career in 
which he established a record of 2,225 games caught before Carlton Fisk broke 
it by one in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone spent 10 seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, seven with the Angels, 
including the 1982 and '86 American League West champions, and was with the 
Royals for his final two seasons. ROSS NEWHAN

CLIPPERS' TOP PICKS WILL WAIT UNTIL THEY FIND THE RIGHT SLOT

<P>
 California forward Lamond Murray and Nebraska swingman Eric Piatkowski, the 
Clippers' top draft picks, are expected to sit out the opening of training camp 
because of salary disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have available salary slots of $3.5 million, $2.4 million, 
$1.1 million and $650,000, have offered their two lowest salary slots to the 
rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the seventh player selected in the draft, is seeking a multiyear 
contract that will pay him $2.4 million this season. The Clippers have offered 
$1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in two different neighborhoods," said Fred Slaughter, Murray's agent. 
"To me, the $2.4-(million) slot gets him comparably paid as I look at what's 
going on with everyone around him. The $1.1-(million) slot . . . is wholly 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski, the 15th player selected in the draft, is seeking a multiyear deal 
that will pay him $1.1 million this season. However, the Clippers have offered 
him a multiyear deal that will pay him $650,000 a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Austin, Piatkowski's agent, said Piatkowski, who has been working out in 
Los Angeles, may return to Nebraska unless a deal is worked out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want these guys signed and in camp, but we're not going to simply overpay 
them to do it," Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said. "They have to want to be 
here too." CHRIS BAKER

WISHBONE HAS BEEN A SNAP FOR YOUNG; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: OREGON STATE BACK HAS A 
GOOD AVERAGE, BUT HE'S LOOKING FOR MORE CARRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the football recruiting season of 1989, J.J. Young of South Pasadena High 
could look back on his high school career with some regret. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, he believed, one of the most explosive offensive high school football 
players in Southern California. He was certainly one of the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, not many knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been used primarily as a defensive back and wasn't being widely 
recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the schools that came calling: The U.S. Military Academy and the U.S. 
Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those that didn't: USC and UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 Now a 5-foot-10, 192-pound senior halfback at Oregon State and headed for a 
1,000-yard rushing season, Young and his teammates will play USC Saturday 
afternoon at Corvallis, Ore., in a game in which Young says he has a point to 
prove. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his point a year ago, in a way. In a 34-9 loss to USC at the Coliseum, 
he gained 101 yards in 13 carries, with a long run of 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really wanted to go to USC or UCLA, I just wanted to beat them," he 
said. "But it upset me that neither school recruited me. I felt then I was good 
enough to play for either one, and, of course, I think I've shown that." 
</P>
<P>
 His old South Pasadena High coach, Fred Cuccia, takes it a bit further. 
</P>
<P>
 "If USC or UCLA had taken J.J., given him the ball 30 times a game, he'd be on 
his way to a 1,000-yard, All-American season for them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a better running back than either school has now. The problem was, he 
was a tremendous defensive back in high school and that's how he was recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he went to Oregon State, he went as a DB. But when I saw that Jerry 
Pettibone came in (in 1990) and was installing the wishbone, I knew Pettibone 
would switch him to offense the first time he saw J.J. run." 
</P>
<P>
 He did. Four seasons later, here's what Pettibone has to say about Young: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my 29th year in coaching and I've seen some of the great running 
backs who've played college football -- Joe Washington, Greg Pruitt, Billy 
Sims. . . . I think J.J. is in that category. He has the kind of explosiveness 
to hit the home run every time he handles the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can also catch the football and he's an outstanding blocker." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, with 28 yards, Young will tie Terry Baker for ninth place on 
OSU's all-time rushing list. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he can move to seventh with a 60-yard game. 
</P>
<P>
 Also from the file: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Young has six 100-yard games, despite never having had more than 22 carries 
in any game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Young had 68- and 57-yard runs against Arizona State and Wyoming this 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 -- As a junior last year, he ranked third in the nation with a 7.0-yard 
average. He's at 5.6 yards a carry this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His 955-yard 1993 season is the fourth highest in Oregon State history. 
</P>
<P>
 Young can only envy those who are given more carries.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10's leading rusher, Napoleon Kaufman of Washington, has 118 carries 
and 670 yards. UCLA's Sharmon Shah has 95 for 482. USC's Shawn Walters has 87 
for 410. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's 51 for 283 ranks him ninth in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'd like to get the ball more, but you play the card you've been 
dealt," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We run the wishbone here, and that's the way it is. Everyone would probably 
like to change some things in their life. But the bottom line is winning, and 
that's basically what I'm trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Young was clocked in 4.37 for 40 yards both in high school and at Oregon 
State. In a high school track meet once, he beat Russell White in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's not a phony 40 time, either," he said. "That's in football shoes 
and on the turf, not on a track." 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think such a guy, with speed, sufficient size and grades -- Young earned 
his economics degree last June and is now in Oregon State's graduate school, 
working for a master's in interdisciplinary studies -- would have been sought 
from here to Notre Dame in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cuccia: "The first time J.J. ever handled the ball for me on offense, he 
went 63 yards for a touchdown. He was special. He was the most dangerous 
offensive player in the San Gabriel Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 "My last year coaching was J.J.'s junior year. The coach who succeeded me 
didn't use him right, and at midseason his senior year J.J. called me. He was 
terribly disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to stick it out, that I'd make some calls for him during 
recruiting season." 
</P>
<P>
 Young was recruited by an odd mix of schools: Syracuse, Iowa State, Oregon 
State, Hawaii, Arizona State and Cal.  
</P>
<P>
 "Cal signed Russell White and Arizona State got Mario Bates, so I scratched 
those two," Young said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Syracuse and Hawaii were too far. I wanted to go somewhere where my mom 
wouldn't be on my doorstep every night, yet close enough where she could see me 
play some games." 
</P>
<P>
 It came down to Oregon State. Young signed without a visit. At the time, in 
Oregon State's pre-wishbone years, under then-Coach Dave Kragthorpe, Young 
figured he'd have a chance to be the main man at running back.  
</P>
<P>
 Then came Pettibone, and the wishbone -- an offense that emphasizes running 
but also one that spreads around the carries.  
</P>
<P>
 After playing most of his freshman season with a knee brace that restricted 
his cutting ability, Young then lost almost all of his sophomore season because 
of an early-season stress fracture of his right leg.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the real J.J. Young emerged.  
</P>
<P>
 "I started and finished the season healthy," he said. "My attitude was, 'Now 
show 'em who you are. Show 'em you could play anywhere in the Pac-10.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Young hopes that the guys who make draft day decisions for NFL clubs will look 
at Oregon State films.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope someone notices that my yardage has come on a lot of different kinds 
of runs, and I hope that someone sees I can block, too," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "At Arizona (where the Beavers lost last Saturday, 30-10) my blocking 
assignment was Tedy Bruschi, and I did pretty good, for a 192-pound guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi is a 6-1, 255-pound All-American defensive end who led the conference 
in sacks last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruschi was my assignment, on five plays," Young said. "I slowed him down on 
every play and twice I cut him and got him on the ground."

<P>
 Tommie Frazier underwent surgery Thursday for recurring blood clots in his 
right leg, but the star Nebraska quarterback is still almost certain to sit out 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Bryan Memorial Hospital in Lincoln tied off a vein believed to be 
contributing to the clots.Deepak Gangahar, a cardiovascular surgeon, said the 
operation went well. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, 20, a junior from Bradenton, Fla., should remain in the hospital for 
a week to 10 days and avoid physical contact for three to six months, Gangahar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing contact sports while on blood thinners would be dangerous because of 
the risk of internal bleeding if there is an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, doctors continued to monitor backup quarterback Brook Berringer, 
who sustained a partially collapsed lung last week but is scheduled to start 
for No. 2 Nebraska against Oklahoma State on Saturday. He will wear a 
protective pad for extra protection.

ANGELOS WANTS QUICK ANSWER ON MOVE; FOOTBALL: ORIOLE OFFICIAL WANTS 'YES OR NO' 
FROM RAM OWNER FRONTIERE ON BRINGING TEAM TO BALTIMORE. 
</P>

<P>
 Peter Angelos, managing general partner of the Baltimore Orioles who is trying 
to bring an NFL team to Maryland, said Thursday he is looking for a "yes or no" 
from Ram owner Georgia Frontiere and team President John Shaw in the very near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for John Shaw to get in touch with us," said Angelos, who is in 
Los Angeles. "With respect to John Shaw and the Rams, it would be far better 
for all concerned to have a yes or no very soon. I believe we could do a deal 
very quickly; we have covered the most important details." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, however, said there remains one major disagreement with Ram 
ownership: The eventual sale of a majority interest in the team. There had been 
published reports that Angelos had softened his position and had indicated he 
might be willing to give up his demand for a majority share of the team if 
that's what it took to get a franchise for Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos discounted those reports and said his position has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's critical to the deal," Angelos said. "I don't want to concede 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an experience in Baltimore (departure of the Colts) that we don't want 
repeated. We're looking for an NFL team to remain in Baltimore for perpetuity, 
and that's not a reflection on Mrs. Frontiere or John Shaw, but we want to make 
sure a football team stays in Baltimore. It just works better when the investor 
group is indigenous to the local community." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he had no meeting planned with Angelos this week, but Angelos said 
there was a possibility the two could get together while he is here. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a possibility," Angelos said. "Obviously I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, who has also expressed interest in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said his 
plans do not include a discussion with the Raiders about a move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "You persist, that's what you do," Angelos said. "Eventually there will be a 
franchise not adequately supported on the local level and one will become 
available for Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, which is also trying to get the Rams, has tentative plans to 
present its offer Wednesday to Shaw.

 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson, who decided to continue playing football

he risked no neurological damage by remaining on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to hand it to him," said Dr. Neal ElAttrache. "When it was explained 
to him that he wouldn't cause himself any damage, but might have some pain, he 
was able to overcome the discomfort and play. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he was asking us was, 'Am I going to risk paralysis by playing?' We told 
him he was not going to risk any neurological damage, but it might prolong how 
long he has some back pain and spasm. It was his decision to play or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson injured his transverse process, which are finger-like bones that come 
off the vertebrae that provide attachments for muscles that allow the torso to 
bend and rotate. The transverse process, ElAttrache said, has nothing to do 
with the support of the nerves that run down the legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens with violent twisting and torqueing, like a receiver would get 
when hit in midair, is an instantaneous tugging on the processes," ElAttrache 
said. "The pelvic rim can also come down on those finger-like bones and snap 
them off. That's what happened to Flipper in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson sat out four games in 1991 after breaking three bones in his back. 
ElAttrache said the injury Anderson suffered against Kansas City two weeks ago 
was not as serious and might have more to do with the scar tissue from the 
first injury than presenting a new fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the same injury but on a much more minor scale," he said. "I don't 
want to downplay this in any way because it's a painful thing, but luckily he 
didn't crack it off or there would have been more disability. Given the 
geographical region that this thing is in, it doesn't pose any danger to 
Flipper." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams did not include Anderson's name on the injury report last week for 
fear the opposition might direct its attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson sat out practice a week ago Wednesday and it was believed that the 
team announced he had flu to cover up his injury. But Coach Chuck Knox insisted 
Thursday that Anderson had indeed been sick with flu. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chandler took snaps in practice, but Knox said the team will probably 
still start Chris Miller at quarterback Sunday against Green Bay and will use 
Tommy Maddox as the backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler injured his ankle in last week's 8-5 loss to Atlanta, but in the last 
few days, Knox said, "his recovery has been miraculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert sat out practice again to rest a sore shoulder 
and ankle. Running back Jerome Bettis, who has been bothered by a thigh bruise, 
also did not practice. T.J. SIMERS

STUNOVA TURNS MATCH POINT INTO CZECHMATE; TENNIS: RIO MESA'S TRANSFER WITH A 
PEDIGREE TAKES LITTLE TIME TO MAKE HER PRESENCE FELT IN THE CHANNEL LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, Zuzana! Won't you play for me? 
</P>
<P>
 Any high school tennis coach would like -- Czech that, love -- to have Zuzana 
Stunova on the team, for her pedigree if nothing else. Seems her mother used to 
be a friend and hitting partner of Martina Navratilova when they were teen-age 
hotshots in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 But her mother -- also named Zuzana -- passed on more to her daughter than 
just her name and a trivia-question link to Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunova, a 15-year old exchange student from the Czech Republic, inherited a 
bundle of talent as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Her sledgehammer ground strokes and shot-making abilities earned her a top 10 
age-group ranking in her home country. 
</P>
<P>
 So when she decided to stay in the United States after visiting this summer 
and enrolled at Rio Mesa High, the Spartans' coach was ecstatic.  
</P>
<P>
 "It proves that God's a tennis player, right?" Steve Worthington quipped. "I 
think Zuzana is the best player in the Channel League. She's just a pleasure to 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore got here two months ago, but last week, she arrived, defeating 
senior Monique Allegre of Camarillo, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad, considering Allegre is ranked No. 10 among 18-and-under singles 
players by the Southern California Tennis Assn. and is being recruited by 
Arizona, Arizona State and Michigan, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very exciting," Stunova said. "I played very carefully because I knew 
she was a very good player." 
</P>
<P>
 Stunova has a 14-1 record, including a 6-0 defeat of Santa Barbara's Pilar 
Montgomery, the No. 1 singles player for the league leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 Stunova's only loss came Wednesday when she fell to defending league singles 
champion Kara Warkentin of San Marcos, 6-4. Her talent and work ethic have 
impressed local tennis cognoscenti. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could be an NCAA Division I player," said Wayne Brian, owner and club pro 
at the Cabrillo Racquet Club, where Stunova and Allegre train. "And depending 
on her size and improvement, she could be a (professional) tour player." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allegre, her practice partner at the club: "She has great ground strokes 
and she's pretty quick and athletic, too. She competes really well. In 
practice, she's always giving it 100%. The same in matches. She's improved 
since she came to the club." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two years ago, Stunova's native Czechoslovakia underwent "The Velvet 
Divorce," peacefully and amicably splitting into the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally smooth, velvety if you will, has been Stunova's move to Rio Mesa. 
"She's fit in beautifully," Worthington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allegre: "Ever since she got to the club, she's been everyone's friend." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like America," she said. "The people here are very friendly. They are very 
helpful for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stunova's English is heavily accented but improving, and her personality is 
bright and engaging. Sitting on the couch at the Cabrillo club with her father, 
Jaroslav, her sprightly smiles contrast the storm clouds outside. She waves to 
friends often during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it belongs to the age, that younger people can adapt easier," her 
father said. "And also probably a little from her nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Stunova's father, who three years ago started his own engineering company 
specializing in industrial automation, has been in his firm's Los Angeles 
office since coming to the United States with his daughter in July. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jaroslav Stuna (in Czech, only females use an extended family 
surname) is departing for the Czech Republic today. 
</P>
<P>
 He returns to the family's home in Pilsen, brewer of famous Pilsner beer since 
the Middle Ages, and where Zuzana first took a sip of the tennis life. 
</P>
<P>
 She began playing for fun at 5 and in tournaments at 10, the youngest age 
possible in Czech. She was trained by her mother, the former Zuzana Korakova, 
who played professionally in Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands and twice 
played the great Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lost both," Stunova said with a giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, Stunova won a tournament in Ingolstadt, Germany, home of the 
Audi.  
</P>
<P>
 Stunova proved to be a sports car among sedans after joining a women's team 
there at the club's invitation.  
</P>
<P>
 She never lost, playing there for months.  
</P>
<P>
 Her life in the tennis autobahn continued when, thanks to the new openness in 
her home country, she left with her father to explore the sunnier tennis 
opportunities in California. 
</P>
<P>
 She enjoyed immediate success, winning the SCTA-sanctioned Reebok tournament 
in Whittier and another junior tournament in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by those victories, she decided to stay in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 She was sponsored by the Camarillo Rotary club's international exchange 
program, and found an ideal host family, the Distads -- who have two daughters, 
Sally and Sarah, on Rio Mesa's tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 And she maintains that despite missing her family and friends at home, she is 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for me; I have more opportunities (here)," Stunova said. "In Czech, 
I play (only) one or two hours a day because we have such long school." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, she plays up to four hours a day in weather that will permit her to play 
outdoors year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaroslav makes a point to list everyone who has helped Zuzana's transition to 
the United States, even calling a newspaper at 10 p.m. to make sure his 
gratitude to Rio Mesa was on the record. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than gush about his daughter, he is quite humble. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has only won two tournaments," Jaroslav said. "She has done nothing yet."

HE'S BEEN ON THE RUN SINCE HIS DAYS AT L.A. BAPTIST AND NOW . . . ; MARKHAM IS 
BACK MAKING HIS PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take a look at Don Markham's bare-bones playbook at Bloomington Highand you 
figure he played too many games wearing a leather helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven plays. Drawn on a yellow legal pad. Four of them runs, two of which are 
called 90% of the time. Two tight ends. Double-wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Running isn't everything, it's darned near the only thing with Markham. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the very beginning, I found that if you're going to throw the ball, you 
can't always count on the guy throwing it or the guy catching it," Markham 
said. "So, we ended up running the ball all the time because of the high 
percentages in it. We keep it simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's extraordinary how overpowering and widely emulated Markham's 
meat-and-potatoes approach has become. Since conceiving the so-called "pitch 
offense" as a confident first-year coach at L.A. Baptist in 1970, Markham has 
dominated in coaching stints at Colton, Bishop Amat, Ramona and Bandon High in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an increasing number of coaches have modeled Markham's offense, 
which relies on a sturdy tailback, double- and triple-team blocking and linemen 
pulling on nearly every play. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are running it all over California," said Bob Francola, who has never 
met Markham but employs the pitch as coach at Kennedy High. "Anyone who has 
been exposed to it realizes how simple it is and what a good high school 
offense it is. We finally got with it in '91." 
</P>
<P>
 Markham will return to the region where his scheme began and is still running 
strong when he brings his undefeated team to Chaminade tonight for a 7:30 
nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first season, Markham has transformed Bloomington from a 1-9 team that 
finished fifth in the Division VIII Sunkist League into a streamlined machine 
that has run over four opponents by a combined score of 280-31. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories have been so lopsided that opposing coaches have charged Markham 
with, well, running up the score. That's exactly what the Bruins have done, 
throwing only 11 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations are nothing new. Markham faced them at L.A. Baptist, which he 
led to a Southern Section championship in 1971, and again at Colton, which he 
built into a power during an 11-year reign that ended in 1983. In Oregon, where 
his team played for the state championship in 1992, Markham was largely 
responsible for the creation of a 45-point mercy rule, often referred to as the 
"Bandon Rule." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't say anything to all of that," Markham said of the complaints. "We're 
not trying to pile it on. We're just trying to do our best." 
</P>
<P>
 For Markham, 55, who was a wide receiver at Birmingham High and Cal State 
Northridge, tonight's visit will be a reunion of sorts. In 1984, he served with 
Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson at Pierce College. He was offensive coordinator as 
the Brahmas compiled a 10-1 record. Lawson, then a 29-year-old line coach, 
considered Markham a mentor. He adopted his system when he became coach at 
Chaminade in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember sitting beside him on all the bus rides, watching him draw plays 
on a pad," Lawson said. "He'd draw lots of circles with the linemen real tight, 
real close together, saying 'Believe in me. This will work.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the offense of choice here. I would have to say that I developed a lot 
of my philosophies from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for George Giannini, who put the pitch in place at Montclair Prep in 
1988 and has watched his backs run wild ever since. In 1989, Michael Jones and 
Derek Sparks both rushed for more than 1,700 yards. In 1992, Eliel Swinton ran 
for 2,384 yards. Last season, Wilbert Smith gained 2,512 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run the pitch over and over again in practice in 15-minute segments," 
Giannini said. "Basically, it's very simple. Once you know it and have the 
fortitude to stick with it, it runs very well. But Markham runs it better than 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Grimes, a Pierce assistant in 1984, installed the pitch as coach at North 
Hollywood. In 1988, Chip Grant rushed for more than 2,000 yards. Today, Grimes 
is offensive coordinator at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret to the pitch? "It puts as many people as possible at the 
point of attack," Francola said. "Fullbacks, quarterbacks, anyone else you can 
find." 
</P>
<P>
 Linemen stand inches apart, providing a shorter route to the point of attack 
on pulling assignments. The idea is to overwhelm defenders with many blockers 
from many angles. The tailback receives the toss from the quarterback several 
yards behind the line of scrimmage and follows a wave of blockers -- which 
often includes the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bloomington, that's senior Jason Buell, who isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of like it," Buell said. "As long as we're winning. Last year, I was 
getting sacked all the time. Coach Markham came in and we all heard his system 
worked. We were willing to try anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington has only 19 players and Markham doesn't like to carry more than 
about 25 on the roster. He has only one assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "With small numbers, it's easier to coach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section administrator Bill Clark spoke with Principal James Downs 
after Bloomington won by scores of 86-8, 84-0 and 62-9. "I offered them some 
options about playing more kids and the running clock," Clark said. "No matter 
how tough it is, it's not good sportsmanship to beat someone 84-0." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark backed off after Bloomington defeated Valley View by a more reasonable 
score of 48-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don's been around a long time and he has a lot of friends and he has a lot of 
enemies," Downs said. "Some of them are going to try to get him. The No. 1 
thing is, our students now have a little more pride. We've had more people at 
our first two home games than we had all last season." 
</P>
<P>
 Markham, who quit his job as a Los Angeles police officer after landing the 
job at L.A. Baptist, exudes a quiet confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew I could coach," Markham said. "As a player, I just shut up and 
listened, but I always thought I knew more than my coaches. I was always saying 
to myself, 'If I was coaching, I could do this better.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly think I could take a bad pro team and win in the NFL with this 
kind of approach. Football is not complex; that's all a hoax. They make it that 
way. They have one coach who coaches pass-rushers and one for special teams. 
It's a joke. One guy could coach the whole thing."

PRO BOXING RETURNING TO VALLEY; FIGHTS: WARNER CENTER MARRIOTT WILL STAGE 
SIX-BOUT CARD ON NOV. 2. IF SUCCESSFUL, MONTHLY SHOWS COULD FOLLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Professional boxing will return to the San Fernando Valley next month by terms 
of an agreement announced Thursday between promoter Peter Broudy and the Warner 
Center Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Welterweights P.J. Goossen and former contender Irish Pat Lawler headline a 
six-bout card scheduled for Nov. 2 in the hotel's 1,000-seat Grand Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen, who is 13-0 with 12 knockouts, is a nephew of Dan Goossen, one of the 
founders of the now-defunct Ten Goose Boxing Club of Van Nuys, which staged 
monthly professional fights at the Country Club in Reseda for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Those shows became less frequent in the spring of 1993, and were halted in 
April when Dan Goossen was hired as executive vice president of Top Rank 
Boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of people have asked me about bringing boxing back to the 
Valley," Broudy said. "I'm happy to say that's exactly what we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Broudy, the president of Celebrity Boxing, regularly promotes cards at the 
Hollywood Palladium, Huntington Park Casino and several Indian reservations. He 
also has staged bouts at the Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month's card will mark the Warner Center Marriott's initial foray into 
boxing. The Irvine Marriott, near John Wayne Airport in Orange County, has 
profitably hosted monthly cards for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Nadley, a hotel administrator, said Warner Center officials talked to 
their counterparts in Irvine extensively and also checked Broudy's other 
references before signing an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all have good things to say about Peter and, the bottom line, it's made 
money, and from the hotel's standpoint, that's what we're looking for," Nadley 
said. "We're hoping this is a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel can exercise an option to host boxing events on a monthly basis if 
the first show goes well, Broudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ten Goose's tenure at the Country Club, boxing fans were treated to the 
likes of former bantamweight title contender Frankie Duarte, International 
Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn, and the Ruelas brothers 
-- Gabriel, the top contender in the World Boxing Council's junior lightweight 
division, and Rafael, the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also more than a fair share of under-card slugs, several of whom 
inadvertently entertained by comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the shows packed the 900-seat facility with a odd mixture of crusty 
beer-guzzlers, young businessmen, women and television and film stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have boxing around, who knows who might show up," Nadley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Broudy said he has a matchmaker working to fill out the five-bout undercard 
for Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavyweight Jimmy Mullins (6-0), a former kick-boxing champion from Simi 
Valley, is expected to be included.

ANDRETTI GOES FOR BIG FINISH; INDY CARS: MARIO ENDS CAREER AT LAGUNA SECA, 
WHERE PENSKE TRIO IS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 PPG Indy Car season concludes this weekend with the Toyota Grand Prix 
of Monterey at Laguna Seca Raceway, but there is little reason to expect 
anything more than the usual parade of red and white Penskes out in front 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five times the Team Penske trio of Al Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul 
Tracy has finished 1-2-3 this season. They have qualified 1-2-3 on three 
occasions and in the standings, Unser and Fittipaldi have clinched first and 
second and Tracy is solidly in third. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Penske has won 11 of 15 races and its drivers have led 1,500 laps of the 
1,999 run this season. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tracy won last year's race here, leading 81 of the 84 laps around the 
picturesque 2.214-mile hillside circuit with its 11 turns. The three other laps 
were led by Fittipaldi, the pole sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 So the most exciting moment -- certainly the most emotional -- might occur 
after the race is over, when Mario Andretti takes a final tour of Laguna Seca 
in a pace car painted "Mario Andretti red" for a final salute to his fans after 
31 years of racing. He is retiring from Indy cars after Sunday's Bank of 
America 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "For sure, it will be emotional," Andretti said. "I just hope we can have a 
good day. It would be great to make the podium (for a top three finish), but I 
would love to be running at the finish. I want to be on the track for the 
checkered flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti has a record three poles in 11 Indy car races at Laguna Seca, but 
surprisingly, among his 52 victories none has been here. He has been second 
three times, once to his son Michael in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "That race in 1992 was most special, my most memorable day at Laguna Seca," 
Mario said. "Mike and I finished 1-2 in the race that was thought to be the 
last time we would be on the track together as competitors, and certainly as 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike was leaving for Formula One, and while things turned out differently 
over there, we didn't know that at the time. I tell you, to share the podium 
with him that day, it was more than I could have hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti returned to Indy cars this season and raced against his 
father, but not as his teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the track, the younger Andretti's bid to break up the Penske combine is 
about the only drama left. He has two victories -- at Australia and Toronto -- 
this season and is 12 points behind Tracy for third place and 14 ahead of Robby 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be tough to beat the Penskes, obviously, but we'll be giving it all 
we've got," Michael Andretti said. "If nothing else, at least we've got a shot 
at finishing ahead of everyone else in points." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, the off-roader from Orange, is still looking for his first Indy car 
triumph, although he has been on the pole twice this season, has led races and 
finished a strong second in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our goals was to win a race this season, and now we're down to our 
last chance," Gordon said. "If nothing else works, we're going into Penske's 
trash cans and find a good setup." 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying will begin today and continue Saturday. The main event is Sunday at 
1 p.m.

 Doris Clark glides easily around the tennis court, showing the 
grace-with-stamina of a natural athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She looks in perfect physical condition for someone 68, even though she eats 
ice cream a couple times a day and still smokes a cigarette when she comes off 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I have a cocktail every evening," she says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 But she knows she is fortunate. She insists it is tennis that helps keep her 
fit. That, she said, and a metabolism that allows her to eat "just about 
anything" without gaining weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is ranked No. 2 in the nation in the women's 65 singles, and is the 
top-seeded player in her division in the United States Tennis Assn. National 
Hardcourts being played this week at Newport Beach Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who has lived in Laguna Beach for seven years, has advanced to today's 
semifinals and is likely to be in Saturday's 9:30 a.m. championship match 
unless her backhand deserts her. At this stage, she has lost only four games in 
three matches against good competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her success, she doesn't regard herself as "a serious player," since 
she competes in relatively few tournaments each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm serious when I'm on the court, but I don't play that many tournaments," 
she said. "I'm just playing in four this year, and I'm not sure I'll play in 
any next season. I don't go from tournament to tournament the way Dodo Chaney 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark was referring to the almost legendary Chaney, 78, her counterpart in the 
tournament's 75 division who says she still plays an average of two tournaments 
a month, including eight national championship events each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy just playing tennis with my friends most of the time," Clark 
said. "But it's nice to do this once in a while just to be able to see where I 
stand against the top players." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark won the national hardcourts in the 65s last year, even though it was one 
of only three tournaments she played. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing a lot of tournaments is really hard work," she said. "I don't know 
how the people who play the pro tours today can do it, as demanding as that 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. The other nationally prominent players in the senior division have 
high praise for her game, regardless of how often she plays. 
</P>
<P>
 They say her speed and quickness is what makes her such a force. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's like a little jack rabbit out there," said Chaney, who lives in Santa 
Monica. "Her speed is her strength. Anyone who moves the way she does has a big 
advantage in senior tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 Another player, Grace Bassett of Washington, agrees. "She's very distinctive 
because she's very fast, very graceful and very intelligent as a player," 
Bassett said. "It's unique in senior tennis for someone to have all three of 
those qualities in their game. And she plays hard all the time with total 
integrity, and that helps her opponents raise the level of their game, too. I 
wish I had a chance to play her more often, but I've never been able to get 
more than a couple games in a match against her." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tournament doubles partner for more than 10 years, Piyachart Hussey of 
Laguna Hills, appreciates the way she's "tough-minded and competitive, but so 
pleasant at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussey added: "And everyone knows about how fair she is with her line calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has enjoyed the opportunities the game has given her. She has played in 
several International Tennis Federation events, and traveled extensively 
playing the game. She has played in China and in several European countries, 
and is planning a trip to Africa next year. 
</P>
<P>
 She began playing at 12, and was No. 1 ranked in Southern California in the 
15s, and in the top five in the 18s. But she didn't play much competitively 
after she married and started a family. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was busy with her children when they were growing up, but then 
started playing in tournaments again in her mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her two sisters also played tennis when they were growing up in Venice and 
Santa Monica. One of her sisters, Marchetta Steiskal, still plays tennis 
although she is not on the same level with Doris now. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other sister, Elaine Kennedy, has multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to spend at least one day each week with her," Clark said. "I know how 
much she would like to be playing tennis or golf now, but she's been very 
supportive of me. She's more of a hero than I am . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pause and then she said: "I know how very, very lucky I am to be 
out there playing tennis, and being able to move the way I do."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; A FRENCH CONNECTION; CUSTOMS: GROUP FINDS 
ATTITUDES TOWARD AMERICANS GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND FINDS ITS ADMIRATION FOR THE 
HOST NATION GROWING AS WELL.

<P>
 So what's it like in France? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides wanting to learn the language, our group focused on French life -- the 
social attitudes, business attitudes and attitudes toward Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The French supposedly have a reputation for showing not-so-good manners toward 
Americans. Yet after interacting and people-watching for five weeks in various 
parts of France, the seven in our group encountered mostly polite gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found the people to be a lot nicer than the stereotype about them being 
rude," Costa Mesa High School senior Susan Channels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills High School junior Jessica Johnson agreed. "If they see someone 
who looks lost, they help. I was never looked down upon as an American." 
</P>
<P>
 The 50th anniversary of D-Day enhanced the warm reception for Americans. Pride 
in our American heritage swelled when we saw flags and banners strung between 
buildings, across streets and in shop windows reading "Welcome to our 
liberators."  
</P>
<P>
 The French appeared to be very generous with charities. Many French citizens 
budget a set amount of money for monthly donations to a variety of causes. An 
advertisement in the metro station asked: "What will you tell your children 
when they ask what you did for Rwanda?" Listed below the question were social 
organizations -- les O.N.G (or Organizations Non Gouvernmentales) -- to 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, public awareness of contemporary issues seems to take a high 
priority. For example, while the issues of sex and AIDS are cautiously 
discussed in the United States, in France there are billboards openly advising 
protection and the use of preservatifs . 
</P>
<P>
 "I really noticed the AIDS posters," said Michelle French, a junior at Los 
Alamitos High School. "Here, things dealing with the body are much more 
censored. In France, art with nudity is seen as beautiful art; here it (can be) 
pornography. It's a different sense of propriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all health issues are addressed so strongly. Very few French adolescents 
view smoking as a risk. For Americans who are used to walking into restaurants 
that prohibit smoking, the contrast is startling. Oxygen becomes precious at a 
discotheque. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking seems to be a smaller problem. The drinking age in France is 16, and 
drinking is considered part of the culture rather than a rite of passage. Great 
pride in food and wine teaches French teens to consume responsibly. As a group, 
we avoided alcohol at summer school meals and parties -- and were seen as 
prudish. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans fascinated the staff and other students at the language school we 
attended. They wanted to know what we ate for breakfast at home and if we 
constantly went to concerts and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students at the school spoke some English. We wanted to practice 
our French; they wanted to practice their English. As a result, an alternative 
"Franglais" was often spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 An American pastime that seems to be just catching on in French stores is 
browsing. The French expect customers entering a shop to buy a specific item. 
Browsing with no intent to buy is often looked upon with suspicion. Some stores 
give permission to browse by posting a sign, entree libre -- free entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Culturally, I was surprised by the non-browsing thing," said Katie Tucker, a 
junior at Sunny Hills. "I'm used to walking in and looking and then walking 
out. Instead, I was getting the 'evil eye.' " 
</P>
<P>
 We noticed a large divergence between the retail and food shops when it came 
to politeness. Clothing stores, especially, had curt employees. Specialty food 
shop owners had the most patience and courtesy -- and probably not surprisingly 
for teens, we spent most of our francs on food. 
</P>
<P>
 In French restaurants and cafes, there is a "self-serve" flavor. Instead of 
waiting to be seated, customers find their own cafe table and wait for service. 
There is no rush when eating. In fact, the customer must ask for the l'addition 
-- or bill -- because it is considered rude for the waiter to bring it without 
being summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiating the French language at school and in town attuned our ears to 
French rhythms. As comprehension increased, so did our confidence. We 
participated in everyday activities and grew accustomed to them starting a 
l'heure -- on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Our admiration of French customs grew as we better understood the society.

SHE'S GETTING PAST THE BRADYS, SORT OF; MOVIES: BUT WITH EVE PLUMB'S ROLES IN 
'GOD SPOKE' AND A SERIES, SHE'LL BE RECOGNIZED AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Eve Plumb dyed her hair red and became a much nicer person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can have regular conversations!" says the actress famous for playing 
Jan on television's infinite rerun "The Brady Bunch." As a blonde, Plumb found 
herself instantly recognized and equally tormented. It seems everyone wants to 
know what it was like to be a Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most working actresses, Plumb was never worried about being noticed. 
"When it doesn't happen, I'm relieved," she says from the Beverly Hills office 
of her publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 But now with the film ". . . And God Spoke," a TV movie and Saturday morning 
series based on Judy Blume's children's book "Superfudge" set to air in January 
on ABC, and the upcoming "Brady Bunch" movie, the 36-year-old actress finds 
herself once again being noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time she doesn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In ". . . And God Spoke," a spoof on "Making Of" documentaries that offers a 
comic glimpse of the production of a biblical epic, Plumb plays herself, 
nonplussed at being cast as Noah's wife. The camera follows her as soon as she 
hits the set, where, besieged by questions from the crew about "The Brady 
Bunch," she only seems uncomfortable once, when someone accidentally calls her 
Jan instead of Eve . 
</P>
<P>
 Director Arthur Borman says Plumb's appearance was "kind of a fluke," 
resulting from one of her friends being an actor in the film. "It was all 
improvised," Plumb says offhandedly, "so it was easy to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But, for Borman, the opportunity to work with Plumb was a coup envied by every 
Generation X'er. "Out of all the actors on the set," the 26-year-old director 
said in a telephone interview, "I was more star-struck by her than by anyone. 
The Brady heritage is just so ingrained." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Bradys, Plumb has appeared with the improvisational group the 
Groundlings and most recently on "Lois & Clark" as the "nice mom." "I'm in that 
weirdo category," she says. "It's different from being a cute young thing to 
being a nice mom, but getting to change categories is a nice thing about being 
an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting since she was 6, Plumb sees the profession, as just that . . . a 
profession. "That doesn't mean I'm completely unemotional about it," she says, 
"it's just that I've gone back and forth over the years wondering what's the 
magic formula. What gets you the work?" 
</P>
<P>
 Plumb had plenty of time to contemplate this mythical formula in her late 20s 
when the work began to slow, the parts stopped flowing her way. "That's when it 
became difficult. I didn't realize how much I worked as a kid because I would 
just get the jobs all the time," she says. Fortunately, her father managed her 
"Brady" money well enough that she didn't have to look for other jobs between 
acting gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Plumb admits that it has been a struggle to "get people to delineate 
between who's Eve and who's Jan, because actually I don't consider Jan this 
fully fleshed-out character. It's not like I was one way when the cameras were 
rolling and another when they stopped. It wasn't a Meryl Streep thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that why she refused to appear in the "Brady Bunch" movie, to further 
distance herself from Jan Brady? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be in it," Plumb said, "but, unlike other Brady projects, 
this time I just didn't have the time because I was shooting 'Fudge.' It gave 
me a good excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Florence Henderson (who has also refused to appear in the "Brady" 
movie) will play the grandmother in the "Fudge" series. While Plumb says that 
it seemed "natural" to have Henderson around on the set, she adds that she 
really doesn't keep in touch with other members of the "Brady" cast. But 
playing a mother to two kids in "Fudge" has given her a chance to contrast how 
she and her fellow child actors were treated on the "Brady" set to how those of 
today are treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could just be the way I remember it," Plumb says, mimicking an old woman's 
voice recalling her childhood hardships, "but it seems like they get a lot of 
attention, much more than we did. They have these people getting them water, 
while in my mind we had it a lot tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a mom in real life, Plumb seems content with her on-screen duties. "Right 
now I have what I've been asking for, a series. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll know when I've really made it when my name is in the L.A. Times 
crossword puzzle," she says. "I've been doing it for years, hoping I'll turn 
up. After all, I have this great palindromic name." 
</P>
<P>
 And a legacy that, thanks to reruns, will be hard to shake.

LABOR DISPUTES PUT BUSINESSES IN A BIG SLUMP; BUSINESS: BASEBALL STRIKE AND 
HOCKEY DISPUTE HAVE HURT RESTAURANTS AND MOTELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Instead of advertising drink or dinner specials this week, the marquee outside 
The Catch Seafood Grill and Sports Bar reads: "No Angels, No Ducks, No Bueno." 
</P>
<P>
 The popular eatery, which opened its doors across the street from Anaheim 
Stadium 16 years ago, has been hit hard by the cancellation of the Major League 
Baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 And things don't look to get much better now that the Mighty Ducks' home 
opener, originally scheduled for Sunday at the nearby Pond of Anaheim, has been 
postponed until at least Oct. 17, and possibly later, because of the National 
Hockey League's labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at wits' end," said restaurant manager Scott Gerbasi. "What can you do? 
You get frustrated and you experience a little bitterness. We rely on a lot of 
fans coming in here before and after games." 
</P>
<P>
 Other restaurants, bars, hotels and motels near the stadium and arena also are 
feeling the pinch. In addition to a loss in profits, the dwindling crowds also 
have resulted in fewer hours and tips for bartenders, servers, maids and other 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is crying in their beer," said Ben Harris, managing partner of the 
Angels Inn, a 72-room motel within walking distance of the stadium. "A 
significant portion of our business comes from activities at the arena and 
stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Maresca, manager of Charley Brown's restaurant, agreed that "it's major, 
major dollars lost. Our business is very much influenced by those sporting 
events. From baseball season alone, we've lost so much bar business. People 
like to come in an hour or so before the game and have a beer because it's a 
lot cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Charley Brown's and El Torito, which are next door to each other, offer their 
patrons free shuttle service to and from arena events, an arrangement that 
proved lucrative for both restaurants last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Having the Ducks here last season was a godsend," Maresca said. "Every night 
they had a home game, our restaurant and bar were filled." 
</P>
<P>
 Maresca is further disturbed about talk that the National Basketball Assn. 
could strike, jeopardizing the seven Los Angeles Clippers games scheduled for 
the arena this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they trying to put us under?" Maresca asked incredulously. "Thank God the 
Rams aren't on strike, even though they want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The Catch, which continues to do booming business during Rams games, will lose 
an estimated $8,000 in business for each hockey game that is canceled. The 
restaurant also lost between $2,000 and $7,000 for each canceled baseball game, 
Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, which is popular with both hockey and baseball players, 
installed a new $120,000 kitchen in its bar area to serve appetizers because 
business was so swift last hockey season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't keep up with the demand, so during the off-season we built 
this kitchen," Myers said. "Now, there might not even be a season. I don't 
think we'll see hockey at least until January." 
</P>
<P>
 El Torito's associate general manager, Ruben Preciado, said the postponement 
of the hockey season has him downright nervous. "Right now, we're discussing 
what's going to happen with the Mighty Ducks," he said. "We're afraid because 
we're losing sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a poster-size California Angels schedule posted on the wall of the 
restaurant's bar, Preciado said: "For every baseball game canceled, we lose 
about $1,400 in liquor sales. The cocktail servers and bartenders (each) have 
lost about 10 hours a week of work." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the restaurants said they hired and trained extra staff in anticipation 
of the upcoming hockey season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, this has been a last-minute deal," Don Myers, managing 
partner of The Catch, said of the hockey dispute. "If they decide on Oct. 15 
that there's no hockey, we have to adjust. Instead of needing 60 employees, 
we'll only need 40." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has forced businesses to seek more business from tourists, 
convention-goers and locals. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said his motel still manages to fill almost to capacity on most days, 
but he has been forced to lower his prices. During baseball season, he said, he 
charges as much as $69 for a room with two beds. This week, his marquee offered 
a $29 room special. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms are also cheaper at the Anaheim Stadium Travelodge, next to Harris' 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are slow," said Ron Robles, the Travelodge's front office manager. 
"Business has dropped about 15%, so rooms are about $6 cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 The Doubletree Hotel Orange County, which is down the street from the stadium, 
was also hit hard by the baseball strike. The hotel houses nearly all the 
visiting teams and many of their fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The abrupt end of the baseball season meant a $75,000 loss in revenue, said 
Mike Kelleher, the hotel's director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's had a pretty big impact on us," Kelleher said. "Right now, we're just 
happy we're not in the hockey business, because we would have continued to lose 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramada Inn Anaheim-Disneyland, on Katella Avenue, depends largely on 
tourists for business and has not been hit too hard by the strike. But the 
hotel's sports bar has experienced a big dip in the number of customers who 
come by. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's next to go? The NBA?" asked Mike Von Flatern, a bartender at CC's 
Sportsbar, which is run by the hotel. "Pretty soon, all that's going to be left 
is roller hockey."

A FAMILY FOREVER; MEMORIAL: FRIENDS PRAISE HARRIET NELSON, A MOM FOR ALL 
SEASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Harriet Nelson, television's model sitcom mom, was remembered by family 
members and friends Thursday as the perfect real-life mother too. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 attended a private memorial service for Mrs. Nelson, who was 85 when 
she died Sunday at her Laguna Beach home of congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills said her cremated remains will be 
interred on a hillside next to her husband, Ozzie, who died of cancer in 1975, 
and son Rick, killed in a 1985 plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to be laid to rest with my father and my brother," said surviving 
son David Nelson, who was holding her hand when she died. "I know she's happy 
with dad." 
</P>
<P>
 To a generation of television viewers, Harriet Nelson was America's favorite 
housewife. From 1952 to 1966 she and her real-life family starred in "The 
Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers watched sons Rick and David grow up on the show. On the series, 
Harriet Nelson was the forbearing spouse who never argued but always managed to 
prove her stubborn husband wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends remembered her for maintaining the same good-hearted nature 
off-camera too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You could always tell where she was on the set. There was always laughter 
coming from there," recalled actor Parley Baer, who for seven years portrayed 
Darby on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joe Sutton, a family friend since 1947: "She was the sweetest lady, next 
to my mom, I ever met. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they were on television was what they were -- just a nice, warm family." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Nelson had lived in Laguna Beach full time since 1977, two years after 
Ozzie's death. The couple had built the house in 1955 in the private community 
of Lagunita as a weekend retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Recordings of Ozzie Nelson's dance band music were played as mourners packed 
the 150-seat Church of the Hills. Several 1930s-era tunes sung by Harriet 
Nelson after she joined the band were played as the service ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iowa-born Mrs. Nelson was eulogized as an embodiment of the "great 
strengths of the Midwest" and a symbol of "a simpler, gentler, kinder time in 
America" during the 1 1/2-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin grandsons Gunnar and Matthew of the rock group Nelson performed an 
unreleased song called "Love Me Today -- Tomorrow I'll Be Gone." Gunnar Nelson 
said it was written after the death their father, Rick. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Nelson drew laughter when he told the crowd that his mother had told 
him, "Whatever you do, don't have a memorial service" for her. "So I'm in a lot 
of trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is certain his parents and brother have been reunited in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing my father, I know something's going on" up there with the trio, he 
added. "I just wonder who's playing David." 
</P>
<P>
 Others speakers included granddaughter Tracy Nelson, who has had a successful 
television acting career, and actress and former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley. 
</P>
<P>
 The service was played on a public address system outside the church for 
reporters.

SEASON'S FIRST SANTA ANAS TO BLOW IN THIS WEEKEND; WEATHER: TEMPERATURES WILL 
RISE, BUT THE WINDS WILL BE MUCH WEAKER THAN THOSE THAT DROVE LAST YEAR'S 
WILDFIRES. AUTHORITIES PLAN TO MONITOR TINDER-DRY AREAS AND TAKE SPECIAL 
PRECAUTIONS NONETHELESS.

 The first Santa Ana winds of the fall are expected today, promising the return 
of summer-like heat and prompting county fire officials to take extra 
precautions against brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists said the dry, desert winds could push Orange County 
temperatures into the 90s, but will be much weaker than Santa Ana winds that 
drove last year's wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly will be a return to some of the warm temperatures after the cool 
weather," said Harry Woolford, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which 
provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predicted winds of about 25 m.p.h. -- half the speed of strong 
Santa Anas -- lasting through the weekend. Forecasts called for inland 
temperatures to reach the upper 80s today and low 90s Saturday and the 70s and 
low 80s along the coast. Santa Ana winds -- compressed by high pressure over 
the desert and shot through mountain passes toward the sea -- bring arid, 
fast-moving air and the greatest danger of brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, officials planned to dispatch added fire engines to even 
routine fire calls and to monitor three weather stations that track wind, 
humidity and temperatures in tinder-dry hills and wilderness areas. If 
conditions warrant, officials will position strike teams in sensitive areas and 
dispatch patrolling fire engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's sensitivity to these conditions was heightened by the Laguna 
Beach fire being less than a year ago," said Emmy Day, a spokeswoman for the 
Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lifeguards braced for a return of summer-like crowds with reduced 
off-season staffing. Lt. Eric Bauer, a Newport Beach lifeguard supervisor, 
advised swimmers to stay near staffed lifeguard towers.

SANTA ANA SETS STRATEGY FOR 3RD STREET; RENEWAL: PLANS INCLUDE STREET REPAIRS, 
POLICE FOOT PATROLS AND A VAN TOTING GAMES FOR CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A month after Operation Roundup swept through 3rd Street in an effort to 
cripple the gang that dominates it, staff from six city departments met 
Thursday to devise a strategy that could keep the neighborhood from spiraling 
back into crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone was very up. There has been a major commitment of time and 
energy on the part of our Police Department and other agencies. The 
neighborhood has realized an immediate relief, but we all need to do more," 
said city housing director Patricia Whittaker, who attended the meeting. "I 
think we're all looking forward to some of these partnerships." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's task force also includes officials from the police, fire, code 
enforcement and public works departments, and a representative of the city's 
anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has pledged to repair sidewalks and streets, put in 
bulletproof street lights and restrict parking to keep out strangers. There 
also are pledges to bring a mobile van of games and sporting equipment to 
Flower Park as part of Santa Ana's anti-gang effort, and plans for meetings to 
educate residents about city money available to fix up their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will participate in an Oct. 29 fair at the neighborhood park, which 
has frightened off families for years because of crime and drug-dealing. The 
fair is being held by a group of parents who have bonded together to walk their 
children to Carver Elementary School in groups. 
</P>
<P>
 And police say they plan to replace the handball court in the park with a 
basketball court so gang members cannot use the wall for cover, work with 
neighbors to train a block captain for a Neighborhood Watch, and direct 
officers to patrol the street on foot more often and get to know the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the officers to get out of the cars as much as possible," Lt. William 
Tegeler said earlier this week. "Once we get the confidence up, we want to have 
a block party." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will meet again in three weeks to talk about exactly what each 
department can do to help the neighborhood, plagued by drug dealing and violent 
crime before the efforts of an anti-gang task force -- along with the Sept. 7 
police sweep that culminated Operation Roundup -- put many suspected gang 
members in jail, officials said. The efforts targeted the West 3rd Street 
neighborhood between Bristol and Olive streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say the street has been quiet in recent weeks, but many are 
skeptical that the city will be able to make a lasting change. The city task 
force is designed to prove them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer George Alvarez said the last time the city worked in a team like 
this was about two years ago, in the Willard neighborhood. "It's very effective 
because you really have to do it as a team effort. You can't just address one 
single area," Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation department officials also expressed enthusiasm for making changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to do anything in our power to make sure that there's as much 
activity as possible for these kids. We're looking forward to it. It's a real 
challenge," said Larry Chavez, supervisor of the city's PRIDE program, an 
anti-gang effort run by the Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to commit ourselves to put recreation personnel out there, and 
probably our PRIDE program. We would like to do it as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said staff members are putting together a recreation van stocked with 
arts and crafts materials, board games, and softball, volleyball and basketball 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the van, or a more permanent trailer, is stationed in Flower Park, 
staff members will start talking to families to let them know about the 
programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Project SABADO, a county-funded project that has helped parents of Carver 
Elementary School children in their efforts, is also planning a neighborhood 
trash cleanup for Oct. 22, a week before the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization also hopes to start up a community garden, and is eyeing a 
vacant lot on 3rd Street as a possible location, said Zelenne Cardenas, Project 
SABADO's director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still going ahead with everything and everyone's really looking forward 
to cleaning up that area. The park has been off-limits for about four years," 
Cardenas said. "Hopefully, this gives us a chance to reclaim a community park 
and raise some funds for the parents."

MAN'S JAIL RELEASE ECHOES THAT OF ARSON CASE; ARREST: HANDYMAN INDICTED IN DRUG 
SWEEP WAS IN TEXAS JAIL AT TIME, ATTORNEY SAYS. HE WAS LET OUT ON SAME DAY 
CHARGES WERE DROPPED AGAINST LAGUNA FIRE SUSPECT, WHO WAS IN MEXICAN PRISON 
WHEN BLAZE WAS SET.

 On the same day prosecutors admitted charging the wrong man in the Laguna 
Beach fire, the district attorney's office agreed to release another man 
indicted in a massive gang sweep after an attorney said his client already was 
in a Texas jail at the time, officials confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Fernando Lopez, a Santa Ana handyman, was arrested Sept. 8 as part of 
Operation Roundup after authorities said they videotaped him selling cocaine to 
a police informant on a Santa Ana street. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Hector Chaparro contends that Lopez has a perfect 
alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very fortunate in this case, because, fortunately, he was locked up at 
the time," Chaparro said. "He always maintained his innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaparro blamed the mix-up on poor-quality videotape, a look-alike drug dealer 
and an unreliable informant. But he said prosecutors acted "quickly and 
professionally" when he presented them with his client's fingerprints and jail 
records on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mel Jensen said prosecutors agreed to release Lopez from 
jail while they investigate further. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we are still checking into it and we have some information 
coming from Texas, Federal Express," Jensen said, declining to discuss the case 
in detail. "We had some information that sounded pretty good so we decided that 
while we were checking on it, (Lopez) should be released on his own 
recognizance." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said he may decide as early as today whether charges should be 
dismissed against Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's sister-in-law said Thursday that he had been telling his family since 
the day of his arrest that the police had the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called us and he said it wasn't him," said Amelia Lopez, 20, who lives 
with her husband and Lopez in a Bristol Street apartment. "He said he saw the 
video and it did look like him, but they were confusing him with someone else.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I want to get out. This ain't me.' He was mad because they had him 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia Lopez said the family didn't do anything to prove Lopez's innocence 
until his court date on Sept. 27, because "at first, he didn't have a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, she said, she went to court with documents from the Texas jail 
that included her brother-in-law's fingerprints, and two small pictures of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that they do good," Amelia Lopez said of the police, "but they 
shouldn't put people in jail before they know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say it is not unusual for defendants with common 
names and similar birth dates to be mixed up within the legal system, or 
briefly taken into custody.  
</P>
<P>
 But Jensen said Thursday it's rare for defendants to spend several weeks in 
jail before such a mix-up is unraveled. Lopez served nearly a month in the 
Orange County Jail. "This does not happen often, it's very rare," Jensen said. 
"We are committed to moving on this type of information as quickly as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez' release came Wednesday, the same day prosecutors made the stunning 
announcement that they had been duped by a false confession and filed felony 
charges against the wrong man in the devastating Laguna Beach arson fires that 
destroyed or damaged more than 400 homes. The suspect, Jose Soto Martinez, 26, 
was in a Mexican prison when the fire was set last Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was arrested along with scores of other men and women in September when 
local authorities joined the FBI in a months-long undercover investigation that 
involved impaneling a second grand jury -- a county first -- and hundreds of 
secretly videotaped drug buys. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lopez was indeed in a Texas jail on April 23 and May 14 -- the days 
authorities have alleged he was seen on videotape selling cocaine to an 
undercover informant -- it remains unclear why it took nearly a month before 
Lopez was released. 
</P>
<P>
 According to grand jury transcripts, a police informant testified that he 
twice purchased powder cocaine from a man later identified as Luis Lopez during 
transactions captured on videotape.  
</P>
<P>
 The informant, Henry Gomez -- recruited by the FBI to be part of the sting 
operation -- has a history of criminal convictions and admitted stealing $115 
from law enforcement officials during the transactions, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's attorney called Gomez's testimony "wholly unreliable" and said he is 
concerned such a mix-up could happen again.  
</P>
<P>
 "The risk of confusion and misidentification is rampant in these (Operation 
Roundup) cases," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor John Anderson, who is handling gang members arrested during 
Operation Roundup, said Gomez's criminal history is "not an issue that's 
important. You can make an issue out of anything."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters and a department spokeswoman did not 
return phone calls Thursday seeking comment about how Lopez was identified for 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among the more than 100 people arrested in Operation Roundup, a sweep 
of Santa Ana's gang-troubled 3rd Street. The busts have been hailed as a tough 
crime-fighting tool used to crack down on Santa Ana's worst gangs and drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez could have been imprisoned for up to six years if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia Lopez said her brother-in-law has been living with her and her husband 
in Santa Ana for two years, since leaving his native Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 She described him as a hard-working man who was trying to stay out of trouble. 
Earlier this year -- Amelia couldn't remember when -- Lopez decided to move 
back to Guatemala to be with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband wanted him to go back too, because there's too many gangs and 
everything here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way through Texas, she said, Lopez was arrested for possessing a stolen 
VCR. But before that arrest, she said Lopez had never done time and worked 
steadily doing construction work, lifting weights and working out in the 
family's cramped living room on his free time. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records, however, list several aliases and birth dates for Luis Fernando 
Lopez and show a conviction for robbery in Los Angeles County last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia Lopez said her brother-in-law only uses one name and that he is 20 -- 
not 22 as identified in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Lopez came home from jail tired and relieved, and sat down to 
a 10:30 p.m. meal with Amelia, his brother, and their 2-year-old toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed happy. Everything was different to him. The place, the baby," 
Amelia Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said he went to work early Thursday with her husband, and that the 
brothers spent the day painting houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said his office is not interested in pinning crimes on innocent people. 
He said prosecutors agreed Wednesday to release Lopez on his own recognizance 
from the County Jail, where he was held in lieu of $50,000 bail on two felony 
counts of drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's true, I assume there may have been a misidentification, but that's 
what we are trying to figure out," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in the business of just convicting people," Jensen said. "We have 
to protect the rights of all."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY WATER WELL OKD OVER PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To satisfy disgruntled neighbors, Recreation and Community Services Department 
officials agreed to add $5,000 worth of lights and motion detectors to a 
structure that will surround a new city water well being dug in Boisseranc 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had told officials in meetings that the well and its eight-foot-tall 
housing would sully the park and attract transients and teen-agers who would 
use it as a refuge from police. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Monday session in which the City Council approved the well plans, 
Mayor Donald L. Bone said he is "taken aback" by residents' continuing protest 
concerning the well project.  
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to putting it where it's proposed or abandoning the project," 
Bone said. He could not support junking the plans, he said, because the city 
hopes to save residents $1 million in rising water rates by reducing dependence 
on outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had moved the well location within Boisseranc Park so it would not 
obstruct the views of the park from nearby homes. Neighbors were mollified, but 
said they would be happier if the well were somewhere else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate them working with us, but is there any place else to put this?" 
asked Sharon McCambridge, whose home adjoins the park. "It's a community park." 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director Donald K. Jensen said his department had not considered 
other sites because Boisseranc "is where the water aquifer is." LESLEY WRIGHT

 The city has moved closer to its goal of building 120 units of housing for 
low-income families next year by buying seven old buildings along Denni Street, 
a city staffer told the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismile H. Noorbaksh, director of public works, told the council that the city 
will raze the buildings, near La Palma Avenue, and use the lots as part of the 
city's Affordable Housing Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved putting the demolition project to bids. Noorbaksh 
estimated the contract would be awarded and the work completed within the next 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Noorbaksh said about 350 people will be able to live in the 
Affordable Housing Project when it is completed in late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will consist of 65 townhouses, 35 senior-citizen apartments, and 
20 single-family dwellings.BILL BILLITER

 Brian Garland is dedicated to the education of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that could be my epitaph, I'd be happy," said Garland, principal of Edison 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is only apropos for Garland, 54, to be recognized this week as 
California Principal of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's humbling, but it also makes one feel good that after 32 years in the 
business, some people have taken notice that you've made a commitment to 
children -- and that's what it's all about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland was among 51 principals from all the states and Washington, D.C., who 
were honored by the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals. He is also a 
contender for National Principal of the Year, to be announced in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Secondary School Principals is a nationwide organization 
of about 45,000 educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland was selected as the state representative by the California Assn. of 
School Administrators, an organization that represents about 16,000 elementary, 
middle school and high school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland, who lives two blocks from the high school and whose two children 
graduated from Edison, started teaching in 1963 in Chicago. He has been at 
Edison since 1970, where he taught and served as vice principal and assistant 
principal before landing the top post seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 English teacher Bob Stolte, who has taught at the school since 1969, praised 
Garland for his leadership, support of teachers and willingness to listen to 
teachers' ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a person who understands and respects teachers," he said.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; BOARD EXPECTED TO OK GRADE-CHANGING RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea Olinda Unified School District board members this month are expected to 
approve a policy prohibiting any district employee or trustee from changing a 
student's grade without a written or verbal explanation from a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule already is part of the state education code, but district officials 
said it needs to be specifically stated as school board policy in light of the 
grade-changing scandal in the district.The controversy involved the changing of 
hundreds of student transcripts without teacher approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The new school board policy would become "an official document of the board," 
Assistant Supt. Peter J. Boothroyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will ensure that "nobody will change grades," school board President Susie 
D. Sokol said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the strict grade-changing rule, the policy also lays out in 
general the district's philosophy behind grading. Teachers, counselors and 
administrators must communicate with parents, both verbally and in writing, 
their expectations for their pupils. And when a student is in danger of failing 
a course, the school staff must document all attempts to contact parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, grades will be determined only by teachers, and those grades will 
be final. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcript tampering came to light when a former math teacher filed a 
grievance with the teachers' union in May upon discovering that one of her 
students' grades had been altered without her permission. 
</P>
<P>
 An auditor hired by the district revealed in August that hundreds of students 
had letter grades illegally changed to "pass" notations or had received double 
credit when they repeated a course to improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate investigation to determine who is responsible for the grade changes 
is being conducted by an attorney for the Orange County Department of Education 
and is expected to be completed next week.MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; HIGH-RISE GARAGE WILL BOW TO CITY

<P>
 A Capistrano Beach man will remove a half-completed third-story addition to 
his garage as part of an agreement with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In late June, the city mistakenly gave Gary Geisel building permits for his 
project, which added second and third floors to his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a neighbor complained after work began, city officials took another 
look, discovered their zoning blunder and halted construction. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a compromise worked out between Geisel and the city, the Planning 
Commission on Wednesday approved a zoning variance that allows a second-story 
addition to the garage. Such a project would normally be prohibited because of 
setback requirements for that structure. Many of the homes in the neighborhood, 
however, have two-story structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Geisel said Thursday that he was unsure how much time and material had gone 
into the third story. He did the job himself and said he cannot reuse the 
lumber that he must tear down. 
</P>
<P>
 Geisel said he is negotiating a compensation settlement with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "As hard as it's been, I've got to give the city credit for working with me," 
Geisel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geisel's wife, Donna, said she is anxious to put the incident behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple plan to build a second story to their house that will connect with 
the addition on the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what we originally planned, but it will turn out better," Donna 
Geisel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors are certain to be pleased. Two months ago, one neighbor likened 
the original three-story structure to putting a skyscraper in downtown Dana 
Point.JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COURT RULES EMBEZZLED FUNDS CAN'T BE 
RECOVERED FROM BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city of Newport Beach cannot recover money from the troubled Bank of 
Newport for checks that former city Utilities Director Robert J. Dixon wrote 
and the bank honored, a state appellate court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled that the district was "better able to prevent the success of 
such frauds than the bank" and that the fraudulent checks might have been 
difficult if not practically impossible to detect for the banking institution, 
Justice Edward J. Wallin wrote in a unanimous opinion issued Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The city sued the bank for negligence in July, 1992, contending bank employees 
should have discovered that something was wrong sometime between 1982, when the 
fraud began, and January, 1992, when it was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon was released earlier this year after serving part of a four-year prison 
term on a 1992 embezzlement conviction. He siphoned more than $1.8 million from 
city accounts at other banks, depositing the checks in his personal account at 
the Bank of Newport. He also used some of the checks to pay off his credit card 
debts, which ultimately exposed the scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the city contended in court that the Bank of Newport was negligent 
for not noticing the volume and size of the checks that Dixon was depositing 
into his account. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the bank, now in a receivership under the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., contended bank employees were not liable to the city because 
it had no Bank of Newport account and there was no reason to suspect anything 
was amiss with the checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard Frazee sided with the bank and 
threw the case out, prompting the city's appeal to the 4th District Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's allegations against Dixon's credit card companies, contending the 
civil equivalent of theft, are still pending. HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 The school board Tuesday night narrowed to three the number of executive 
recruiting firms bidding to assist in the search for an Irvine Unified School 
District superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will review proposals from three educational consulting firms 
to conduct an assessment of the 21,500-student school district. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members want to survey district employees and community members 
before deciding whether to conduct a nationwide search to replace Supt. David 
E. Brown, who is leaving in November to become superintendent of the Napa 
Valley Unified School District. Two of the district's deputy superintendents 
have expressed a preliminary interest in replacing Brown, according to school 
board member Tom Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
 The three firms are Educational Management Services of Thousand Palms, 
Management Analysis and Planning Associates of Berkeley and Witt/Kieffer Ford 
Hadelman & Lloyd of Irvine. They will make half-hour presentations at a public 
meeting at 5 p.m. Tuesday in the school board meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
 The selected firm will conduct community forums to identify the top 
educational issues for the district and determine what "personal attributes" 
community members want in a new superintendent, according to Burnham. Only 
after results from the community surveys are compiled will school board members 
decide whether to seek candidates outside the school district. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; HOMEOWNERS RESIST WATER PLANT EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moulton Niguel Water District's plan to expand a water treatment plant 
here has received a clear "thumbs down" from neighboring homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the plant at La Paz and Kings roads say they want the district 
to eliminate the plant's nasty odor before embarking on the $7.5-million 
project in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a state-of-the-art facility that stinks to high heaven," Crown Royale 
Homeowners Assn. secretary James Brown said. He said property values around the 
plant are declining because of the plant's stench. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district said the expansion plan will not increase odors from the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The district wants to equip the plant to reclaim more waste water for 
irrigation, said Larry Dees, who is heading the project for the water district. 
The state requires that water districts recycle water. That step in the 
treatment process doesn't cause odors, Dees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel plant treats 12 million gallons of commercial and 
residential waste water a day, with 9.6 million gallons being treated twice, 
making it clean enough to be released into the ocean, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest is cleaned three times, which makes it suitable for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the expansion, 11.4 million gallons of the water treated there will be 
cleaned three times, Dees said. The expansion, which includes bringing in a new 
tank and new filters, is expected to take more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dees said the plant's occasional foul odor comes from the pond in front of the 
treatment plant, where the water that has been treated twice is stored for a 
short time before being washed out to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the plant's odor has increased in recent years, making life 
unpleasant for nearby residents. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; BINGO BOOSTERS TRY TO LIFT SMOKING BAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High school bingo boosters, fearful of losing Irvine Unified School District's 
most profitable fund-raiser for their music programs, are pushing to lift an 
impending ban on after-hours smoking at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Stalter, vice president of the Irvine High School Instrumental Music 
Boosters, said U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has shown interest in amending the 
federal law that goes into effect Dec. 26.The law will ban smoking at all 
public schools, public libraries and child-care facilities. Feinstein's 
representatives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine High School raised $33,000 from bingo last year for music programs. The 
district's three high schools earned a total of $60,000 from the games held 
Wednesday and Saturday nights at Rancho San Joaquin Middle School in Irvine. 
Surveys have indicated that most players will not attend nonsmoking games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will put an end to our valuable fund-raiser," Stalter said. "It would 
take a lot of carwashes and bake sales to make $60,000." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, public schools earn $2.5 million a year from bingo, 
according to Stalter, who has met with booster groups from other districts. 
Because of the high cost of leasing alternate space, Stalter said most bingo 
operators are hoping to amend the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Music boosters asked the school board this week to pass a resolution in 
support of amending the no-smoking law. But school board President Mike Regele 
said it is unlikely that the law will be changed. The district is committed to 
becoming smoke-free by 1995, Regele said. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CHURCH IN OFFICE PARK HAS 6 MONTHS TO MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given a local congregation six months to move from an 
office building where it has held services for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The church was supposed to move from an office park near Harper Street and 
Westminster Avenue by the end of this week.The extension will give the church 
more time to look for a different location. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not what we want, but I'm grateful," said the Rev. Randolph Vasquez, 
pastor of the 25-member Fellowship of Praise Church, following the council's 
unanimous vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With support from nearby residents, the congregation had sought to remain at 
the same location, but city officials said churches are not allowed in 
commercial areas under the city's zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, this council considers that churches are not good in 
shopping centers," Mayor Frank Kessler said. "Commercial areas are for 
generating revenue, not holding religious services." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council also rejected a request by another congregation to 
convert parts of an office building near Lewis Street to a church. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said that he received a letter dated Sept. 23 from the city ordering 
his congregation to move out in 15 days, which would have been today. It was a 
shock to the church members, he said, because they thought they had helped 
improve a neighborhood that was once plagued by gangs and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a radical group," said Richard Flores, director of the church's 
children services. "We don't sit there and cut chickens. The neighbors said 
they were happy with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said more than 60 residents signed a petition supporting the 
church.BERT ELJERA

GROUP OF OCC STUDENTS, INSTRUCTORS TO BE TESTED FOR TB; HEALTH: THOSE WHO 
ATTENDED SUMMER COURSES WITH A LOS ANGELES WOMAN LATER FOUND TO HAVE 
COMMUNICABLE TUBERCULOSIS WILL BE SCREENED TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as sixty Orange Coast College students and three instructors who 
attended classes with a woman later found to have communicable tuberculosis 
will be screened for exposure to TB on Tuesday by county health officials, a 
college spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students and instructors attended classes this summer with the Los Angeles 
woman, who dropped out in August to go on a dance tour, college spokesman Jim 
Carnett said. She then began to experience symptoms and the TB was diagnosed in 
a Miami hospital in early September, he said. She notified the college later in 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Weismuller, disease control manager at the Orange County Health Care 
Agency, said health officials are most concerned about 20 to 25 students and an 
instructor who attended two sessions of a drama class with the woman in August. 
Others were notified of the screening as a precaution, but the woman was not 
believed to have the communicable disease when she attended any other classes, 
Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnett said the students and instructors have been informed by mail of the TB 
skin-test screening. The tests, which involve pricks to the skin of the 
forearm, will be administered Tuesday in the college. On Thursday, their 
forearms will be checked for a reaction indicating exposure to TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who test positive will need a chest X-ray to see if the disease can be 
detected in the lungs, Weismuller said. A sputum test would be needed to 
determine whether the disease is communicable. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who have positive skin tests never develop active tuberculosis. 
The disease, which usually affects the lungs, is transmitted by air from person 
to person, often through coughing, sneezing, laughing or singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnett said the current screening is not related to the last round of tests 
in the spring, organized after another student with active tuberculosis 
attended classes with 146 students, three faculty members and two course 
assistants. No one tested was found to have developed active disease.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / VILLA PARK; FIRE PROTECTION DOMINATES COUNCIL RACE; THE 
CITY'S REFUSAL TO JOIN A COUNTYWIDE COALITION FOR FIREFIGHTING SERVICES HAS 
DRAWN CRITICISM. PROPOSAL TO INSTEAD CONTRACT WITH ORANGE STIRS AN UPROAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Debate over fire protection in the city is heating up the race for the Nov. 8 
City Council elections.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Loritz, the lone opposition candidate who hopes to oust one of the three 
incumbents, says the controversy over fire protection is definitely a concern 
of residents of this wealthy little city with a population of 6,400. Loritz 
accuses the council of having an "upside-down" fire-protection plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute involves the City Council's refusal, so far, to join a new 
countywide coalition of cities served by the Orange County Fire Department. 
That coalition, called the Joint Powers Authority, would be the new governing 
authority for the county Fire Department, along with county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park is the only city now served by the county Fire Department that has 
refused to join the authority. A majority on the council, including two of the 
three incumbents seeking reelection, has accused the authority of being poorly 
conceived and possibly leading to fire-protection tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joseph S. Barsa and Mayor Barry L. Denes repeatedly have criticized 
the authority. The third councilman seeking reelection, Bob Bell, has spoken in 
favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special council meeting in August, Barsa proposed that Villa Park try to 
get its share of county fire-protection money from the county Board of 
Supervisors. If that happened, Barsa said, the city could explore contracting 
with the city of Orange for fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal produced political turmoil. Villa Park organized as a separate 
city 32 years ago, mainly to escape from Orange. The two cities over the years 
have had many political spats. Joining with Orange, in anything, is unthinkable 
to some long-time residents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 27, a letter signed by 12 former Villa Park mayors and council 
members warned the City Council not to contract and urged it to join the Joint 
Powers Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Wayne Silzel, who read the letter to the council, also warned of 
possible political retribution from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to say you're not listening to the community," Silzel told the 
council. He added, "If you want to fight, I'll see you at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 Loritz, 26, a businessman and volunteer fire captain, is hoping that the 
uproar will lead to his election on Nov. 8. Loritz supports the authority and 
says the Orange idea is neither feasible nor economical. 
</P>
<P>
 While Loritz sees that as the main campaign issue, incumbents Denes, Barsa and 
Bell all said they view the city's budget and financial planning as the 
dominant concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Denes, 49, a business executive and former Marine officer in Vietnam, said he 
supports much of the Joint Powers Authority proposal but that it puts no cap on 
possible taxes three years hence. Denes said he is thus opposing Villa Park's 
joining until the authority adopts a limit on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Barsa, 61, a small-business owner and former chairman of the St. Joseph 
Hospital Foundation, said he thinks the authority will not be a campaign issue 
and predicted that the fire matter will be settled, one way or another, by 
election time.

 Bell, 60, a real estate broker and youth soccer and baseball coach, said he 
supports the authority because he believes regional public safety agencies are 
more efficient and less expensive than smaller departments.

NEW ANTI-GANG GROUP PLANS PUBLIC MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new committee has formed to combat gang problems in Orange County and is 
inviting the public to attend its first meeting Tuesday at Koo's Cafe in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- called the Orange County Community Leadership Gang Task Force -- 
will work as a watchdog organization and plans to monitor other nonprofit, 
police- and city-sponsored gang prevention programs.Members also will try to 
recruit employers to offer jobs to local youths to provide an alternative to 
gang involvement, said Javier A. Cortez, a teacher and community activist who 
will serve as the group's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be a proactive group with the purpose of coming up with solutions to 
the gang problem in Orange County," Cortez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was created this week by members of Los Amigos de Orange 
County, a Latino activist group. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most serious preoccupations that we have is that of the gang 
issue," Los Amigos Chairman Amin David said. "We have felt somewhat ineffective 
in our work toward doing something about the tremendous issue of gangs in our 
community, and we want to do something serious with this new committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Chavez, a community activist, and the Rev. John Sebrero will serve as the 
task force's first and second vice chairmen, respectively. Other board members 
include: Gail Byrne, who helps find jobs for at-risk youths in Irvine; doctors 
Carlos Guardiola and Manny Trujillo; Alfredo Lugo, a free-lance television and 
radio producer; and Alex Moreno, a parent counselor for the city of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, city employees, community activists, former and current gang members 
and anyone interested in joining the task force can attend Tuesday's meeting, 
which will be at 7 p.m. at the coffeehouse, 1505 N. Main St.

JOGGER STRUCK BY CAR, CRITICALLY HURT IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are investigating a traffic accident in which an unidentified jogger 
was struck and critically injured Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a woman, was hit just before 7:30 p.m. near Magnolia Street and 
Martin Avenue, Sgt. Keith Levin said.Several passersby, who had emergency 
medical training, provided assistance until the woman could be transported to 
UCI Medical Center in Orange with severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said the woman was struck by a Nissan pickup truck driven by Jung Kim, 
of Garden Grove, who was traveling north on Magnolia. However, it was not 
certain how the accident occurred, he said, adding that it was not alcohol or 
drug related.

LAPD CHIEF, PARKS REPORTEDLY SETTLE FEUD; LAW ENFORCEMENT: WILLIAMS' TOP 
ASSISTANT WILL STEP DOWN BUT KEEP CURRENT PAY. COUNCIL MEMBERS HAD URGED 
SIMILAR COMPROMISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams and his former top assistant, 
Bernard C. Parks, have agreed to settle their politically charged feud with a 
compromise that allows Parks to keep his current pay while accepting a 
demotion, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between the Police Department's two most powerful figures might 
be cemented as early as this morning, when the City Council could vote to keep 
Parks' pay at $128,388, even as he drops from an assistant chief to deputy 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams reportedly initiated the settlement with the man he beat out for the 
chief's job, even though he had said just a week ago that he would not allow 
"political tampering" by council members who had proposed a similar agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chief made the overture to bury the hatchet in the best interest of the 
city and the department so we can put this all behind us," said a source 
familiar with the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks is not expected to return to work for a week or two after an agreement 
is finalized. Meanwhile, he would be given an assignment by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 With completion of the agreement, the most serious political controversy of 
Williams' administration would be settled. The chief enjoys enormous public 
popularity, but has been under increasing pressure from Mayor Richard Riordan 
to move ahead with plans to increase the size of the department and implement 
reforms recommended by the Christopher Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The demotion of Parks and several other staff changes announced last month 
were widely viewed as Williams' response to the increasing political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 With the understanding reached Thursday, Williams would not force Parks to 
take a $6,500-a-year pay cut that normally would come with his demotion, while 
Parks would agree to drop one rank from assistant chief to deputy chief. Parks 
would agree to waive any legal claim against the city for unfair treatment or 
improper notice of the demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The understanding between the two men is virtually the same as proposed by 
several City Council members last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The political leaders had said that Parks, a popular 29-year veteran, had been 
demoted without proper notice and treated shabbily by Williams. Councilmen 
Richard Alatorre, John Ferraro, Nate Holden and Zev Yaroslavsky proposed that 
Parks take the demotion without a loss of pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and the Police Commission came to Williams' defense, saying that the 
chief should be allowed to run the department without interference by council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his most demonstrative proclamations since he became chief, Williams 
insisted just a week ago that he would not bow to the council's demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make the decisions," Williams told reporters at the time.

FIRM SAYS IT IS NOT TO BLAME ON SUBWAY JOB; TUNNELS: PARSONS-DILLINGHAM CLAIMS 
THAT IT IS BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT AND THAT SHEA-KIEWIT-KENNY INTENTIONALLY 
CONCEALED CONSTRUCTION FLAWS FROM THE INSPECTION FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The assigning of blame for construction problems that have shut down subway 
excavation in Hollywood intensified Thursday, as the firm paid to inspect the 
work accused the tunneling contractor of deliberately hiding defective work. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegation was leveled by an official representing the inspection firm 
Parsons-Dillingham, which itself is under fire for its role in not catching 
substandard construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the chief executive officer of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority said he will immediately refer the allegation against 
the tunnel contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, to the MTA's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray W. Judson, assistant to the chairman of Pasadena-based Parsons Corp., 
parent of Parsons-Dillingham, said in a statement that the inspection firm is 
unfairly being made a "scapegoat" for the subway project's problems. 
Parsons-Dillingham and its earlier affiliated inspection firms have received 
about $260 million for inspecting work on the subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunneling has been shut down along Hollywood Boulevard since Aug. 18. 
Engineers have said the failure of wood bracing helped cause surface sinkages.  
</P>
<P>
 Judson accused Shea-Kiewit-Kenny of hiding improper installation of filler 
material surrounding the wood wedge braces, which project engineers approved as 
substitutes for metal struts. The wedges, placed in expansion gaps of the outer 
tunnel shell, are supposed to be surrounded by high-strength concrete or grout. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson said: "As a result of the sinking along Hollywood Boulevard, which 
exposed the wedges and dry packing, P-D now believes that (Shea-Kiewit-Kenny) 
deliberately and willfully covered up nonconforming work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The improper filling of the expansion gaps on the Hollywood tunnel project 
was not identified by P-D because the filling material was covered over by 
(Shea-Kiewit-Kenny)," Judson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny did not return calls seeking comment. 
They have said in the past that the company's contract requires it to refer all 
media inquiries to Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, MTA chief executive officer, said further investigation 
would be required to determine the merit of Parsons-Dillingham's allegation. 
For now, White said, he will ask his agency's inspector general to review the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 White also said that he wants the allegation assessed by a separate 
engineering firm that the MTA hired last week to investigate the construction 
of the tunnels being built by Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 If warranted, White said, "we will take all appropriate action, including 
making criminal (investigation) referrals. . . . The inspector general is the 
intermediary point between our management and law enforcement agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities, including the FBI and the inspector general of the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, have been investigating various aspects of Metro 
Rail construction over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham said Thursday that it has provided the level of inspection 
paid for by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the MTA budget restrictions under which (Parsons-Dillingham) operates, 
P-D has consistently employed the maximum number of (qualified) inspection 
personnel," Judson said. "The MTA budget does not provide for continuous and 
simultaneous inspection of all tunnel construction activities." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who said earlier this week that he is considering whether to terminate 
the contracts of Parsons-Dillingham and Shea-Kiewit, disputed the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing in the (Parsons-Dillingham) statement comes close to justifying P-D's 
failure to thoroughly inspect critical tunnel support elements," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons made a similar comment one year ago when questioned 
about inspectors' failure to identify thin concrete poured in tunnels Downtown. 
An independent review launched by White of that earlier work concluded that 
Parsons-Dillingham fell short of "acceptable industry practice" in its 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson said that Parsons-Dillingham has been unjustly vilified. "We can no 
longer remain quiet about the outrageous allegations that have been made 
regarding our performance," he said.

STAR-STUDDED SHOW'S PROMOTER HAS RECORD OF BOGUS SCHEMES; ENTERTAINMENT: KEVIN 
VON FELDT SAYS HE HAS SIGNED COMMITMENTS AND 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' WILL OPEN NOV. 
15 AS ADVERTISED. BUT KEY CONTRACT IS LACKING, AND ACTORS' EQUITY OFFICIALS ARE 
SKEPTICAL. 
</P>

<P>
 A man convicted of promoting a bogus theatrical production in the San Fernando 
Valley and bilking ticket buyers is again advertising an elaborate show, "A 
Christmas Carol," featuring such stage giants as Sir John Gielgud and Shirley 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 But producer Kevin Von Feldt has yet to secure a crucial contract with the 
Actors' Equity Assn., the union that controls members' work in live 
productions, and Equity officials said this week they were extremely skeptical 
that the Nov. 15-20 show at Pasadena's Raymond Theater will materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't expect it to ever happen," said George Ives, Equity's 
executive director, citing Von Feldt's record of aborted efforts and 
misdemeanor convictions for consumer fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 A defiant Von Feldt, once termed "a career con artist" by Los Angeles City 
Atty. James K. Hahn, maintained that the show will go on -- that he has signed 
contracts with all five stars, completed sets and costumes, and has backers who 
can post the necessary bond with Actors' Equity to ensure that the cast will be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehearsals for the eight-city tour, to be launched at the rarely used, 
1,980-seat Raymond, are set to begin Oct. 24, Von Feldt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past is past," he said. "This is this year and I've spent eight months 
working on this show." 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old Von Feldt, who said he lives in Pasadena and Wisconsin, 
recently completed a three-year probation for a 1991 conviction for "untrue and 
misleading advertising." He was also fined $1,762.50 in that case and ordered 
to pay restitution to ticket buyers who responded to his promotion of four 
Broadway classics -- "The Music Man," "Born Yesterday," "My Fair Lady" and 
"Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 The hit shows were purportedly being staged at North Hollywood's dilapidated 
El Portal Theatre and featured such big-draw actors as Noel Harrison, John 
Davidson, Gary Sandy, Claude Akins and comedian Don Rickles -- curiously cast 
in the somber "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 Season tickets for the renamed Renaissance Theatre series were advertised at 
$78 and $85. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles police detectives found that Von Feldt had begun promoting the 
1991 event before he had signed agreements with Actors' Equity or all of his 
stars, some of whom complained about the use of their names. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week at the Raymond -- where he showed off backdrops, 
props and what seemed to be a new set of contracts -- Von Feldt blamed the 1991 
affair on a sublease agreement with the old theater's tenants, saying they did 
not tell him about the amount of cleaning the fading theater needed and how 
much back rent was owed to the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he simply ran out of money before he could get the shows on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 He similarly blamed a failed 1992 production of "A Christmas Carol" on the 
owners of the planned venue, the Scottish Rite Temple in West Los Angeles, 
saying the fraternal order never told him the building lacked a permit for use 
as a commercial theater. 
</P>
<P>
 A Scottish Rite member who used to manage its temple and auditorium, Gaylord 
Roten, said Thursday that Von Feldt was repeatedly told of the zoning problem 
but "he just wouldn't take no for an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Feldt also began building sets, printing tickets and promoting the event 
before securing a written rental agreement for the auditorium, said Roten and 
lodge secretary Ralph Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roten also said he had been impressed by what he saw of Von Feldt's work 
and enthusiasm, and believed that his efforts suffered because of the stigma of 
his 1991 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for Kevin," Roten said. "He's really got a great play. He just 
needs to get it on stage once and it will be off and running." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Feldt has filed a lawsuit against the fraternal order over the zoning 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 In both failed productions, Von Feldt insisted, he repaid ticket buyers. "I 
have never allowed a situation where I can't afford to offer refunds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another "Christmas Carol" production, at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in 1989, 
was canceled after actor George C. Scott, who was cast as Scrooge, quit a few 
weeks before opening night, saying "payment had not been made in a timely 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Feldt's history of run-ins with Los Angeles authorities also includes 
convictions for operating what they called a phony airline and a bogus movie 
promotion in the mid-1980s. After pleading no contest to a total of 10 counts 
of untrue and misleading advertising in a case prosecuted by the city 
attorney's office, he was sentenced to a year in the jail, ordered to perform 
200 hours of community service and placed on three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hawaiian Pacific Airlines case, Von Feldt was accused of charging 
aspiring pilots, stewards and other personnel for training so they could work 
for a nonexistent fleet of planes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie promotion case, he was charged with advertising books of tickets 
to 52 movie classics without having rights to use the films or the theaters 
where he said he would show them. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Von Feldt said he has learned his lesson and pledged that the 
curtain will finally rise on his adaptation of "A Christmas Carol," part of 
which he wrote while serving his jail sentence. A former movie projectionist, 
he said he has always dreamed of a career as a stage impresario. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed signed agreements with stars Brian Keith, Louis Anderson, Patrick 
McGoohan, Michael Tucker and Jones, and said they and the rest of his 40-member 
cast will tour Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore and 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents for each of the stars, or their representatives, would not comment in 
detail. Each said they had spoken to Von Feldt, but declined to elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Gielgud, Von Feldt said he has a "taped narration" of the play 
recorded in 1992, which he said he has permission to use. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, the musty but still stately Raymond just needs new carpeting and 
a good cleaning "to get rid of the pigeon smell," Von Feldt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's owner, Marc Perkins, said Von Feldt only has a one-month lease 
for its use, which runs out Oct. 31 -- two weeks before opening night. "He 
needs to come up with more money," Perkins said, noting that newspaper ads for 
the play appeared before the agreement was signed. "If not, the play won't 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins said that he regretted accepting a deposit from Von Feldt without 
checking into his background. "It disturbs me that I haven't done my homework 
as I usually do," he said. Ives of Actors' Equity said that because the 
agreements proferred by Von Feldt lacked Actors' Equity letterheads, they could 
only be preliminary agreements and not valid contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been going through this for several years now," Ives said. "I can only 
say that in the past, all of this has never resulted in his being able to do 
what he is talking about."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; SPANISH-LANGUAGE MEDIA FIGHT 
INITIATIVE; GROUP THAT OWNS KMEX-TV GIVES $100,000 TO THE FIGHT AGAINST THE 
PLAN, WHICH TARGETS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. OTHER HELP FROM TV, RADIO STATIONS AND 
A NEWSPAPER INCLUDES FREE OR REDUCED-RATE ADS.

<P>
 Led by a $100,000 contribution from the television giant Univision, 
Spanish-language media in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California have joined 
funding efforts aimed at vanquishing the hotly contested ballot initiative 
known as Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ezell, a co-author of Proposition 187, called the Spanish-language 
media involvement outrageous and said it indicated a bias in coverage -- a 
charge disputed by Spanish-language media representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Univision Television Group, parent body of KMEX-TV, Channel 34 -- the 
leading Spanish-language channel for news in Los Angeles -- has donated 
$100,000 to Taxpayers Against 187, the chief anti-proposition coalition, 
reports show. That contribution is one of the largest so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Univision group, based in New Jersey, owns and operates 11 stations 
nationwide, including other California outlets in San Francisco and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Univision's donation, Spanish-language television and radio stations 
have been airing free ads soliciting donations for the campaign against 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Lozano, editor of La Opinion, the influential Spanish-language daily 
based in Los Angeles, personally contributed $5,000 to the anti-187 effort. In 
addition, La Opinion also has agreed to run reduced-rate advertisements 
soliciting money for the effort against Proposition 187. Times Mirror Co., 
parent of the Los Angeles Times, owns 50% of Lozano Enterprises, a California 
Limited Partnership, which does business as La Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition opponents, fighting an uphill battle against strong voter support 
for the initiative, are struggling to raise money for a planned advertising 
push before Nov. 8, Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 La Opinion, along with Glendale-based KVEA-TV, Channel 52, is also hosting a 
fund-raiser for Latino business leaders next week to benefit Taxpayers Against 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 is a direct attack on the Latino community," said a strongly 
worded invitation -- signed by Jose L. Lozano, publisher of La Opinion, and 
Michael G. Martinez, vice president and general manager of KVEA -- sent to 
prospective donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latino children, like our own children, may be detained, questioned and 
reported to INS (the Immigration and Naturalization Service) because of their 
surname and the color of their skin," the invitation said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 advocates deny that the measure is aimed at any single 
community and say that no one will be targeted because of name, color, 
nationality or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, the initiative's co-author, said it was "not fair" that 
Spanish-language media outlets have shed the usual press reluctance to 
associate directly with campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be the way they do it in Mexico, but that's not the way we do it in 
America," said Ezell, former INS regional commissioner, who has been a 
lightning rod for criticism by anti-Proposition 187 activists. "I wish I knew 
what they were saying about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Univision Television Group is a United States corporation. Its minority 
shareholders include Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media conglomerate headed by 
Emilio Azcarraga, Mexico's preeminent press baron. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the media said their current level of political involvement 
was a first, reflecting the gravity with which many Latinos view the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to educate the people, because we believe (Proposition 187) can 
be defeated if people know what this really stands for," said Maria Gutierrez, 
director of public affairs and labor relations at KMEX. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the supercharged debate has forced Spanish-language news executives to 
wrestle with a wrenching ethical dilemma: Are they crossing the line into the 
advocacy camp? Most general interest newspapers and broadcast outlets generally 
avoid strong positions outside of clearly marked editorials or commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We normally do not take sides, but this is a very unusual time, and a very 
unusual proposition," said Claudia Camarena, spokeswoman for KVEA.  
</P>
<P>
 An exception was made, Camarena and others said, because of perceptions that 
the proposition would engender discrimination against all Latinos, even legal 
residents and U.S. citizens. "This would make all Latinos suspect," Camarena 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, say initiative supporters, who note that the measure targets all 
people in the United States illegally, regardless of nationality. Polls have 
shown considerable support for the proposition among Latino voters. Among other 
things, Proposition 187 would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public 
school educations and most tax-supported health care and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal aliens are an equal opportunity problem," said Ron Prince, initiative 
co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their clear anti-187 orientation, Spanish-language media executives 
said their activities had not compromised news content. The Spanish-language 
press has generally devoted much more coverage to Proposition 187 than its 
English-language counterparts, reflecting the intense immigrant interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say (coverage) has been fair, but we've certainly become more 
actively involved as a newspaper in an electoral issue than we ever have 
before," said Monica Lozano of La Opinion, who said her $5,000 contribution 
reflected a personal commitment.  
</P>
<P>
 Media organizations regularly run paid political advertising, but it is 
unusual, albeit not unheard of, for mainstream outlets to donate time or space 
to campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Times Mirror Co. donated advertising space for sponsors of Charter 
Amendment F, a police reform measure later approved by the voters. At the time, 
critics said the donation lent credibility to accusations that The Times 
coverage was skewed. Times executives denied any bias. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission, which licenses broadcast outlets, also 
places no limits on partisan activity by stations, so long as the sponsors are 
clearly identified, said Milton Gross, chief of the commission's political 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Ezell said he would seek a commission investigation into the 
contribution by Univision and other anti-187 activities by Spanish-language 
broadcasters.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SUPERVISORS TENTATIVELY OK LIMIT ON GARAGE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors moved Thursday to tighten restrictions on what for 
some Southern Californians has become a weekend habit, tentatively approving an 
ordinance to limit garage and yard sales in unincorporated areas to twice a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was spurred by a number of complaints about people conducting these 
sales on a weekend basis, some of them even selling new merchandise and 
essentially doing business in a residential area," said Robert Alaniz, a 
spokesman for Supervisor Gloria Molina, who sponsored the measure."These are 
not the typical 'let's clean out the garage and closet' types." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance allows residents to have two garage sales a year, with each sale 
not to exceed three consecutive days. Sale hours would be limited from 7 a.m. 
till 6 p.m. and signs advertising the sale would be limited to one for each 
street surrounding a residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was tentatively approved on a 3-1 vote, with Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 A vote on final approval of the ordinance is scheduled in two weeks.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FOOD FROM 
THE 'HOOD SEEKS HELP ON MISSING EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw High School students who run a campus-based, food-growing company 
asked for the public's help Thursday after more than $8,000 worth of business 
equipment was discovered missing from their office. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment, belonging to Food From the 'Hood, an innovative enterprise 
started three years ago at Crenshaw High, included two complete computer 
systems, a camcorder, a fax machine and a laser printer, student-owner Charo 
Darwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment had the etched initials F.F.T.H. along with the company phone 
number, she said. Most crucial were the computers, which held a program to help 
students prepare for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which is being administered 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to call the Los Angeles Police Department's 
77th Street Division, (213) 485-4162.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; REWARD 
OFFERED FOR LEADS IN PRICE CLUB WORKER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $50,000 reward has been offered in the murder of an Inglewood Price Club 
store assistant manager who was slain in a holdup that netted the robbers about 
$15 in change. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the victim's family vowed at a news conference Thursday to continue 
their efforts to help find the two men who killed Randy Terrian, 37. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to catch these people," said Archie Terrian, 60, of northern San 
Diego County, his voice breaking as he spoke of the murder of his son Sept. 24. 
"We watch the TV news every night and all it is is murders and robberies up 
here. . . . Something's got to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Terrian of Agoura Hills was killed by a gunshot wound to the head after 
he and another store employee were confronted by two men, one armed with an ice 
pick and the other with a handgun, outside the store after closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killers 
was posted by the Washington-based Price-Costco corporation, owners of the 
Price Club. Anyone with information on the crime can call Inglewood detectives 
at (310) 412-5246 or an anonymous 24-hour crime hot line at (310) 412-8825.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA; SCHOOL'S 
UNIFORMS ARRIVE AFTER MONTH OF DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The uniforms have finally arrived at La Mesa Junior High School in Santa 
Clarita after a month's worth of delays that angered parents and school 
officials, but delighted students who viewed the uniform policy as too 
restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 A bizarre assortment of problems, including a truck hijacking and computer 
malfunctions, delayed delivery of the clothing that was supposed to reach 
students by Sept. 8, the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is the first in the Santa Clarita Valley and one of the first in 
the state to mandate uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were especially concerned because they prepaid the uniform supplier, 
Cherokee Inc. of Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every piece of clothing has been delivered, but because most items -- 
ranging from T-shirts and shorts to more dressy attire -- are now in the hands 
of students, the school has declared Monday its first official mandatory 
uniform day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the students have them," Principal Rochelle Neal said. "If 
they can't wear the uniforms, they need to come with a note from their parents 
and we will look into their problem with the company."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FPPC FINES 
MARATHON FIRM $236,000 FOR DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Fair Political Practices Commission approved a $236,250 fine 
Thursday against the operators of the Los Angeles Marathon for laundering 
campaign donations to 14 political candidates, most of whom were running for 
the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The action follows the city Ethics Commission's approval Tuesday of a similar 
settlement that included a $200,000 fine.Together, the penalties represent the 
third-largest political ethics fine in U.S. history, FPPC Chairman Ben Davidian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several city ethics commissioners had criticized marathon President 
William Burke and said they believed he knew about the money laundering scheme, 
the state commissioners were silent on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon has already paid the Ethics Commission fine in cash, but it will 
pay the FPPC in installments over several years. "They were able to prove they 
are not financially able at this time to meet the total fine," FPPC spokeswoman 
Jeanette Turvill said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: THE TRAIL OF TEARS; 
TRAGEDY: GRIEVING FATHER TRAVELS 2,000 MILES ON HORSEBACK TO DRAW ATTENTION TO 
HIS SON'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHING-CHING NI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ranch hand and bull rider Johnny Martin always wanted to ride on horseback 
down the Pacific Crest Trail with his son. He finally began his trip on 
Memorial Day alone, carrying his 23-year-old son's ashes on the more than 
2,000-mile journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, from the town of Springville near Visalia, began his journey in 
Vancouver, British Columbia, and ended it this week on the steps of Los Angeles 
City Hall to demand that the Sheriff's Department reopen the investigation into 
how his son died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I was with two horses in Downtown L.A.," Martin said Wednesday, in his 
white cowboy hat, blue jeans, lace-up boots and gold-rimmed glasses. "They 
didn't arrest me. They acted like I wasn't even there." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin says his son, Tim, died Oct. 3, 1993, in a traffic accident after he 
was beaten by several men who broke his arm and ribs in the parking lot of a 
Santa Clarita rodeo ground. Martin's daughter, Tina, who held her brother in 
her arms when he died, witnessed the incident and said her brother lost control 
of his truck and crashed while trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have ruled that the death was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circumstances determined by the California Highway Patrol and the coroner's 
office didn't dictate that a homicide investigation be done," Deputy Benita 
Hinojos of the Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Martin, 43, says his only hope of getting the case reviewed is if he can 
get enough publicity to attract witnesses who saw what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office says the case can be reopened only if the family can come 
up with new information. So far, they do not have any reports about the alleged 
fight before the traffic accident, said Scott Carrier, spokesman for the 
coroner's office. The coroner's report showed a 0.09% blood-alcohol content, 
slightly over the legal driving limit of 0.08%, Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, Tim Martin was a bull rider. The two often worked together on 
various ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up in a very farm-like family," says Tina Martin, 22. "Dad came (to 
Newhall) for work and was staying with Timmy a couple of months before (the 
accident)." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin plans to scatter his son's ashes at a bull-riding school in Santa 
Maria, where he learned to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timmy told his brother and sister, 'I want to be cremated and spread where I 
rode the best,' " the elder Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said his long journey gave him the peace of mind he was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if it was good for Jesus and the religious people to go to the 
mountains and clear their heads, I thought I should too, instead of doing 
something bad and be a vigilante."  
</P>
<P>
 For four months, all Martin had for company were his horses, the cowboy poetry 
he often read and a small dog who started following him in Dufur, Ore. Martin 
survived a number of forest fires, the Lake Tahoe earthquake, lots of rainy 
days and sometimes no drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 When he read his own poetry, Martin said he "drove every squirrel, bear, 
cougar mad with my mistakes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Logging 10 to 30 miles daily, Martin knew nothing but what was happening on 
the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Did you hear O.J. (Simpson) killed his wife?' " Martin said one backpacker 
asked him in Oregon about the allegations against the former football star. "I 
said, 'Really? What else happened?' You don't know if you're at war or 
nothing!" 
</P>
<P>
 After a rest in Canyon Country with his older son, Martin headed Thursday to 
Scottsdale, Ariz., for the International Cowboy and Indian Congress. The 
congress helped make his trip possible with a $3,000 donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin also helped raise money for charity organizations such as Cowboys 
Against Cancer, American Indian College Fund and the Special Olympics. Martin 
says he doesn't know how much money he brought in yet, but people pledged about 
$20 for every mile he rode. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected to outlive my son," Martin said. "I just hope anyone with 
news on this would please come forward so we can bring this to justice."

WAVE OF VIOLENCE; SURFER SAYS HE WAS ASSAULTED DURING WORLD-CLASS COMPETITION 
AT MALIBU BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It had all the makings of a world-class event. Surfing legends Mickey Dora 
flew in from South Africa, Buffalo Ke'aulana from Hawaii and Greg Noll from 
Crescent City were there. Chumash Native Americans gathered around a fire to 
bless the competition, tossing sage into the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of showcasing the glory of longboard surfing, the competition held 
last week at Malibu's Surfrider Beach offered an unexpected look at the sport's 
sometimes violent underside. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after organizers of the Oxbow World Longboard Championships asked 
non-competitors to leave the water, a surfer who failed to do so was allegedly 
beaten by a world-ranked competitor and another competitor's father. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident left 43-year-old Richard Ernsdorf with head trauma, bleeding 
about the eyes, a separated shoulder and facial cuts that required 15 stitches. 
 
</P>
<P>
 It has also left the surfing world abuzz. This week everyone from local surf 
rats to the editor of one of the sport's preeminent magazines were talking 
about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it excruciatingly embarrassing," said Nick Carroll, editor of Surfing 
magazine, adding that surfers are usually on their best behavior at events. "I 
guarantee you that quite a few surfers are hanging their heads in shame. I 
don't know of a world-class surfer that would have behaved that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernsdorf, a resident of the San Fernando Valley community of Sun Valley, is 
pressing assault charges against his alleged attackers -- Joseph Tudor, the 
father of world-ranked longboard surfer Joel Tudor, and Lance Hookano, a 
renowned longboarder from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty well tumbled," said Ernsdorf, who had been surfing since 5:30 
a.m. "I was almost drowned. . . . What I worry about is, will my kids get beat 
up by other surfers because of this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of the incident vary. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department and county lifeguards, it occurred sometime after 8 a.m. Sept. 27, 
the final day of the weeklong event, when Ernsdorf was sitting in the water on 
his kneeboard, a very short surfboard designed for riding while kneeling. 
</P>
<P>
 After a contest announcer asked non-participants to leave the water, Tudor, 
43, stroked out on a paddleboard and told Ernsdorf to return to shore. A splash 
fight ensued, and Tudor hit Ernsdorf in the face, authorities say. Tudor 
disputes this, contending that Ernsdorf threw the first punch. But he admits 
that he held Ernsdorf under water for "what seemed like 20 to 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Hookano, 34, arrived on a paddleboard and began hitting Ernsdorf repeatedly in 
the head and face, according to police reports. Hookano could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hubbell, the organizer of the event and a part-time lifeguard, pulled 
Ernsdorf to shore with the help of a lifeguard who was on duty. Ernsdorf was 
treated at the Santa Monica Hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition, sanctioned by the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, drew 87 
surfers from as far as Japan and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Hookano, who is from Oahu, won fourth place and $1,500. Graham Stapelberg, 
chief financial officer of the association, said no rules exist that would have 
allowed immediate disqualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Tudor's son, Joel, won third place and $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernsdorf filed assault charges with the Sheriff's Department later that day. 
The case will be sent to the district attorney's office to determine whether 
charges will be filed, said Sheriff's Lt. Jim Glazar. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hubbell, whose company organized the event, and representatives of the 
Assn. of Surfing Professionals, the organization that sanctioned it, the fight 
besmirched the competition, which helps determine the world champion of 
longboarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is probably one of the ugliest scenes I've seen at an event between a 
non-competitor and a competitor," said Stapelberg. "This one was of an 
extraordinary nature. Maximum fines ($1,000) will be levied and because the 
incident falls under the category of bringing the sport into disrepute, it will 
go before a review board." 
</P>
<P>
 Stapelberg said Hookano could be suspended from competition for six months to 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, who has produced more than 200 surfing competitions, said that 
tensions were high before the Surfrider Beach incident. Organized surf events 
had monopolized the beach for the previous three weeks, and the waves were 
head-high due to a south swell -- as good as they had been all summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, frustration did not excuse last week's violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was disgusting," said Tom Nefcy, 40, a surfer who had just gotten out of 
the water when the incident occurred. "These guys are supposed to be the 
Michael Jordans of our sport. . . ."

BLACK CHURCH GROUP LEADS VOTER DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than two dozen of Los Angeles' most prominent African American ministers, 
politicians and activists gathered at the city's oldest black church Thursday 
to announce an interfaith coalition of about 400 churches statewide to combat 
what they called an emergency situation in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-September, the coalition has registered 17,000 new Southern 
California voters in what it said is their campaign's first step, organizers 
said at First African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a one-shot deal," said the Rev. Joe B. Hardwicke, president of 
the voter registration project, adding that church leaders are negotiating with 
corporations to open factories in South-Central Los Angeles. "We will fight 
together, we will stand together, we will grow together and demand our 
God-given rights," Hardwicke said. "This is a new day. There will be no more 
business as usual in this community!" 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition hopes to sign up 8,000 more African American voters in the 
Southland by Sunday, and increase turnout at the polls in November by getting 
100,000 registered African American voters to vote by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to turn around the plight of our community, the imprisonment 
of young men, the poverty, the crime, the only way we're going to do that is 
with the ballot box," Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second step is to follow up after the election to make sure that elected 
representatives are held accountable and bring jobs to the inner city, 
coalition members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who vote must follow through, said state Sen. Teresa Hughes 
(D-Inglewood). "It's not just passing one bill, it's not just getting one 
person elected," she said. "It's staying on their case and making sure they are 
accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is part of a statewide voting effort organized by the California 
Legislative Black Caucus. Registration materials are available at First A.M.E. 
and other black churches in Carson, Pasadena, South-Central Los Angeles and 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort will climax this weekend as Jesse Jackson, Rosey Grier and 
Washington mayoral candidate Marion Barry come to Los Angeles to sign up 
voters. From tonight through Sunday, statewide radio broadcasts will encourage 
African Americans to register and vote. The deadline for registering to vote in 
the November elections is Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks have been hypnotized before and on Election Day to say, 'I don't have 
to vote,' only to wake up after the election and say, 'What happened?' " said 
Barbara Boudreaux, a Los Angeles Unified School District board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said education was also desperately needed, noting that people still 
volunteer to help her campaign for California secretary of state even though 
she lost the June Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders said they hope that churches -- which Moore called "the 
salvation of the black community" -- can help combat the social problems they 
say plague their community. To that end, the churches will help organize a 
statewide conference of black leaders in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not give up in spite of the rather overwhelming odds against which we 
struggle," said Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. "The city of Los 
Angeles cannot be what it ought to be unless the quality of life of the African 
American community is improved."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; BEILENSON'S TOUGHEST

 As he faces voters this November, veteran U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) is struggling against a mighty anti-incumbent riptide and a 
well-financed GOP foe in Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 These perils have thrust the 61-year-old Beilenson's bid for a 10th term into 
the national limelight. National media have focused on Beilenson's plight, as 
have a slew of political pundits. All insist they smell blood in the 24th 
District, which takes in Sherman Oaks, Malibu and the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson, a senior member of the House Rules Committee, is far from 
defenseless as he enters what is likely to be the toughest battle of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging outlines of Beilenson's strategy are classic: He is not your 
average politician, Beilenson maintains, not a Beltway insider, not a slavish 
poll-watcher, not a special-interest tool. In other words, not an incumbent bum 
who should be thrown out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is not new to Beilenson. The congressman, who served in the 
Legislature before going to Washington in 1976, used it in 1992 to stymie 
another foe, former GOP Assemblyman Tom McClintock (who is now running for 
state controller). 
</P>
<P>
 With potent effect, Beilenson boasted that he took no special interest 
campaign contributions from political action committees, but that McClintock 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that wasn't enough to establish himself as a different kind of 
politician, Beilenson in April, 1992, also split dramatically with his liberal 
roots to support a constitutional amendment to prohibit children of illegal 
aliens from automatically becoming U.S. citizens just because they were born in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 When the election votes were tallied, Beilenson scored a lopsided 56%-38% 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But analogies can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not 1992. In 1992, the collapse of the Bush-Quayle campaign caused 
shock waves throughout the California GOP ticket. In 1994, after two years of 
Democratic hegemony in the White House and Congress, the undertow pulling at 
incumbent Democrats is powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Sybert, who is president of a Santa Barbara-based toy design firm, 
another McClintock. Sybert, 42, is a moderate while the rightward-leaning 
McClintock had his flanks easily turned by Beilenson in the bid for the 
district's centrist vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very difficult for Tony Beilenson to paint me with the same 
brush he used on McClintock," Sybert said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Beilenson is a classic liberal," Sybert said the night he won the 
Republican nomination. "He's soft on crime, weak on defense and tough on 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters of the 24th District should be outraged, Sybert said, that Beilenson 
voted for Clinton's deficit reduction plan, which resulted in a hefty tax boost 
that hit the district's large upper-middle class hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson admits Sybert is a formidable foe. "It's a competitive district," he 
said in an interview. "It's a district the Republicans are targeting, and it's 
different than it was in 1992. McClintock was very conservative, and 1992 was a 
very big year for Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Beilenson team is loading up on Sybert ammunition, pointing out the 
challenger's appetite for political action committee contributions and noting 
that he is a 24th District newcomer. "Raw ambition is what Richard Sybert is 
all about," said Craig Miller, Beilenson's campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the governor's Office of Planning and Research, the Harvard Law 
School-educated Sybert was a top policy wonk in the Wilson Administration from 
1991 to 1993 after spending 13 years as a lawyer in a major Downtown Los 
Angeles law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert jump-started his bid for the 24th District GOP nomination by loaning 
his campaign more than $420,000 of his own money. He swamped his four 
Republican opponents and was quickly dubbed a rising star by the Republican 
national party. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the 24th District has hosted a parade of GOP luminaries who 
have stopped by to laud Sybert and help him raise money, the latest being House 
GOP leader Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia). 
</P>
<P>
 On the issues, Sybert backs Proposition 187, the statewide ballot initiative 
to deny key public services to illegal immigrants; has signed the GOP's 
so-called "contract with America," a pledge to back a balanced budget amendment 
and congressional term limits, and has advocated tougher criminal laws. But 
although his rhetoric is often hot, Sybert is a moderate on the hot-button 
topics of gun control and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Gingrich visit only further demonstrated how deeply the Sybert 
campaign is indebted to Republican outsiders and the money they can attract, 
said Miller, Beilenson's campaign aide. That this would be the case, Miller 
contended, is not surprising: After all, Sybert is a newcomer to the west San 
Fernando Valley. "Rich Sybert has no inherent support in the community," Miller 
said. "He's totally dependent on Republican powerbrokers and PACs for his 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, records show that Sybert did not establish his residency in the 24th 
District until Oct. 4, 1993, and that he has assiduously courted business PAC 
funding. On Sept. 24, he held a fund-raiser in Washington just for PAC donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beilenson points with pride to his deep, longtime involvement with 
measures to protect the Santa Monica Mountains; his success in amending this 
year's federal crime bill to provide $1.8 billion to reimburse states hit 
hardest by the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants in state prisons, and 
his vote to support Clinton's deficit reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Beilenson also decided to oppose Proposition 187, perhaps the 
most controversial measure on the November ballot.

CONTROVERSIAL BLACK PANTHER MURAL OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The walls of Los Angeles are accustomed to controversy in the form of murals, 
but few proposed pieces of art have gone through the gantlet of scrutiny that 
Noni Olabisi's tribute to the Black Panthers -- titled "To Protect and Serve" 
-- has endured. 
</P>
<P>
 After three rejections by the Cultural Affairs Commission and nine months of 
effort on the part of a city-funded mural program, the work featuring a 
gun-toting Huey Newton was approved Thursday by all six of the seven 
commissioners present. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're new commissioners and this was a learning process," commission Vice 
President Jayne Levant said after the vote. "It was a joy to be able to vote 
for this." 
</P>
<P>
 The approval apparently closes the first sticky controversy faced by this 
panel, appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan. But not everyone at the meeting was 
happy with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Rik Violano, a director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, strongly 
objected to the mural, saying it glamorizes a group that had a history of 
violently resisting the police. "Here we are subsidizing a mural of a group 
that has been known to assault the police," he said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the mural had come to Thursday's meeting prepared for 
opposition. Officials of the nonprofit Social and Public Art Resource Center 
(SPARC), which commissioned the work, an ACLU official, a minister from the 
First African Methodist Episcopal Church and other backers filled the 
commission's small Downtown domain. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue was whether the panel had overstepped its bounds in turning down 
plans for the mural to be painted at 11th Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard on the 
west-facing wall of a beauty shop. Because the commission regulates signs, any 
such artwork funded by a city contract must get the commission's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, supporters had accused commissioners of judging the work on its 
content, which a city ordinance expressly forbids them from doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Newton is a primary figure in the 40-foot-long mural, there are also 
scenes depicting the Panthers' free breakfast program and other social projects 
the militant group undertook. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a historical piece painted by a young African American woman," said the 
group's Judith Baca. 
</P>
<P>
 Group staffers said commissioners were reacting to the art's content during 
their first meeting in February when they turned down the project. "As soon as 
we opened up the rendering, they were aghast," said one staffer. "All the 
discussion centered around the Black Panthers and why we were glorifying them." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Parachini of the ACLU called the commission's initial rejection "a case 
of classic censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 But Levant said Thursday that the work was troubling only in that it might 
have stoked tensions already existing in the neighborhood between residents and 
the police. "I was never opposed to the mural," she said. "I think all of us 
had concerns that the mural might -- might, I say -- be a public safety issue." 
"I think the work is very high quality," said Cultural Affairs Department 
general manager Al Nodal. "We're making a big mountain out of a molehill. We 
already have a mural very similar to this on 54th and Western which hasn't 
caused any riots." 
</P>
<P>
 That mural, which depicts sorrowful faces reacting to the first King beating 
trial verdict -- and includes the figure of an anonymous man being beaten by 
the police -- was also done by Olabisi. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, supporters of the Panther mural came armed Thursday with a 
petition listing900 neighborhood residents, as well as a map of the area they 
had scoured for the names. The commission had wondered if the neighborhood had 
truly been consulted about the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baca was only five minutes into her impassioned speech supporting the 
project before the commission president interrupted her and the panel voted to 
approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it as a good mural and an expression of what the community wanted," 
said commissioner Lee Ramer. 
</P>
<P>
 Olabisi, weary of the battle, is reluctant to talk about her beleaguered 
project, much less explain her reasons for including, among the myriad images, 
a familiar rendering of Newton with a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you know our history," she said referring to the Panthers' rise to 
prominence in the 1960s, "you know it was when we started fighting for our 
rights."

UCLA STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 boisterous UCLA students and civil rights activists marched 
through the Westwood campus Thursday, some saying that Proposition 187 would 
subject them to unwarranted racial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a rally after the march, Miya Iwataki of Californians United Against 
Proposition 187 decried what she saw as the creation of "an environment ripe 
for racism" by "save our state" proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the October Student Movement and Californians United Against 
Proposition 187, the demonstration was intended to inspire students to "take 
ownership of the issues . . . and understand the politics and coalitions 
working against us," student organizer Alyssa Kang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Cervantes, local student representative of Californians against the 
measure, said the day's events at UCLA were part of a coordinated statewide 
protest and voter registration drive also taking place at 20 other campuses.

CASH-STRAPPED OWNER SEEKS BUYER FOR WEST VALLEY HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Triad Healthcare Inc., the Encino firm whose bankruptcy earlier this year cast 
a cloud of uncertainty over two San Fernando Valley hospitals it owns, said 
Thursday it will sell or lease one of the facilities to raise money to repay 
its debts, including a defaulted $167-million loan insured by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is seeking a buyer for its money-losing West Valley 
Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park, a 139-bed facility known locally for 
its programs for expectant parents and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad executives said losses at West Valley Hospital have been subsidized by 
Triad's profitable Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center, which houses the 
renowned Sherman Oaks Burn Center and an AIDS ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad acquired the hospitals in 1991 with the help of a $167-million loan 
guaranteed by Cal-Mortgage, a state program that has helped many health care 
institutions qualify for low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the firm defaulted in July, 1993, forcing state officials to suspend the 
Cal-Mortgage program, potentially leaving taxpayers on the hook for the loan. 
The default damaged the hospitals' reputations and triggered investigations by 
the state Legislature and the state Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Triad filed in federal bankruptcy court to reorganize its finances 
and begin paying off creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law. Dennis 
Simon, Triad's bankruptcy trustee, declined Thursday to say how much the firm 
hopes to make by selling or leasing West Valley Hospital, but said the proceeds 
would be used to pay off suppliers and similar creditors first. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said under the plan, payments to the state of California -- the firm's 
biggest creditor -- would not begin until 1997, with an expected payment of 
more than $5 million. He said the state would receive all its money over 25 
years under the plan, which is still subject to approval by a federal 
bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state can be a relatively longer-term player in this. The state has an 
interest in supporting health care for the very long haul. . . . Everyone sees 
the benefits of seeing the hospitals come out of bankruptcy soon," said Simon, 
who hopes to bring the firm out of bankruptcy by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Fenwick, deputy director of Cal-Mortgage, said his agency has agreed to 
wait longer for the sake of smaller creditors. But he said it is too early to 
tell if the state will be stuck for any of the defaulted loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is drawn so that if the facility is successful, that's a potential. 
Whether that's the way the plan comes out is too early to tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad executives said the company has taken several steps to reinvigorate 
itself financially, including cutting salaries and signing new contracts with 
several health maintenance organizations such as Blue Cross and Aetna. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it declared bankruptcy, Triad had few contracts with HMOs, which now 
supply the bulk of patients to Southern California hospitals. Occupancy rates 
recently were anemic at both Triad hospitals, with Sherman Oaks hovering at 31% 
and West Valley barely managing to fill 22% of its beds. The Los Angeles County 
average last year was 48%. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad said it also is paying top executives far less. In the past, eight top 
officials and four secretaries drew $1.4 million annually, but a Simon-led team 
of five executives and one secretary now gets $720,000 a year.

'WHEELCHAIR VIGILANTE' GETS 6-MONTH TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man described by a prosecutor as "a gun-toting wheelchair 
vigilante" was sentenced Thursday to six months in jail for pulling a loaded 
pistol on two construction workers who had parked their pickup truck in a zone 
reserved for the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
 A Municipal Court jury last month found Brent L. Newsome, 36, guilty of seven 
counts of assault and weapons offenses after a trial in which Newsome's version 
of events, as given on the witness stand, conflicted with his words, picked up 
by a police tape of the construction workers' 911 emergency call. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what hung him," said Deputy City Atty. Elijah Richardson. "The jury 
didn't believe him. They didn't like him. He came across as very arrogant and 
acted as if he was a privileged person." 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision, Newsome objected to the "vigilante" description, 
describing himself instead as "the epitome of a crime victim," saying he was 
left unable to walk when he was shot by a robber nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsome described himself as an active member of Project Support for Spinal 
Cord Injuries, which he said helps the disabled poor obtain care and equipment. 
He is a volunteer at the Wheelchair Olympics, he said, and competes in 
wheelchair hockey and wheelchair rugby, and is a certified ski instructor for 
the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Alice Altoon ordered Newsome to begin serving the sentence later this 
month and also placed him on three years probation. Newsome said he would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Richardson, the two victims, partners in a construction company, 
were returning home on the Ventura Freeway after working late. The older man 
pulled over in a shopping center at Ventura and Topanga Canyon boulevards in 
Woodland Hills to respond to a page. Richardson declined to name the two 
construction workers because they are crime victims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the parking lot was virtually deserted, the man parked his pickup 
truck in the reserved handicapped space closest to a pay phone. While he was on 
the phone, Newsome wheeled up and began shouting, according to the prosecutor's 
summary of trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was angry and out looking for trouble," Richardson said, adding that 
Newsome brandished a .380-caliber pistol and shouted that he would not tolerate 
their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Richardson said, Newsome hid his gun in a nearby bar, and the second 
construction worker dialed 911. When Newsome emerged from the bar, witnesses 
testified, he clapped his hands gleefully and said, "This is going to be a lot 
of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He then wrestled the phone from the other construction worker's grip, and 
asked: "Hello? Is this 911? . . . This is the (disabled) guy who's kicking the 
guys out of the parking space." Richardson added that Newsome told police the 
men had thrown him from his wheelchair and refused to help him back in. 
</P>
<P>
 But his statement was disputed by the construction workers and a bartender who 
witnessed the fracas. They said Newsome fell from the chair while wrestling the 
construction worker for the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The 911 tape portrayed Newsome -- who had no vehicle with him that night and 
thus did not need a parking space -- as more of a vigilante than a victim, 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just get really frustrated," Newsome told police. "I've been in a 
wheelchair nine years and these guys just stand around and lah-dee-dah. I just 
don't appreciate people parking in handicapped zones." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not in a vehicle at the time," Newsome agreed Thursday, but another 
disabled person "could have been."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; DETECTIVE TELLS HOW TO PREVENT ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Avoiding confrontations with shoplifters, remembering what a criminal touched 
and trusting employees to make deposits can prevent robberies, police told a 
group of Van Nuys merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch on Wednesday, Detective 
Greg Demirjian of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Division told 
area merchants that commercial robberies in Van Nuys were down about 10% during 
the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the most frequent robberies -- of 7-Eleven stores -- could have been 
prevented. Of the 348 robberies reported to the Van Nuys station this year 
through September, 7-Elevens have been robbed 22 times, Demirjian said.  
</P>
<P>
 "More than half of those 7-Eleven incidents were beer shoplifts when an 
employee tries to stop them and gets assaulted, making it into a robbery," 
Demirjian said. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent such incidents, Demirjian suggested closing mini-market doors late 
at night and installing a cashier's window that customers must push money 
through when making purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Unpredictability is another key to preventing robberies, particularly during 
daily bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people do get robbed, they say, 'Gee, I take it to the same bank every 
day, to the same teller at the same time,' " Demirjian said. "That's a real 
problem. You become predictable to a criminal. If you have somebody on payroll 
you can trust to make the deposit, have them do it some of the time." JEFF

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 500 STUDENTS GET LESSON IN RAILWAY SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just three weeks after Glendale and Burbank police officers boarded Metrolink 
trains and cited seven adult drivers and pedestrians as a public warning to 
heed railroad crossings, transit officials brought the same message to a 
younger crowd Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 students at Incarnation School in Glendale spent an hour watching 
cartoons or films -- depending on their age group -- showing the dangers of 
walking on railroad tracks or playing near them. They also got an earful from 
Ray Jackson, a safety engineer with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
who spelled out the risks in terms that kids understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trains can come from any direction, at any time," Jackson told a group of 
third-, fifth- and sixth-graders. "After the train crosses, you may think it's 
safe to run across the tracks, but another train could come out of nowhere, 
from another direction, and hit you." 
</P>
<P>
 As a volunteer with Operation Lifesaver, a nationwide safety campaign that 
started more than two years ago, Jackson said he lectures on railroad safety 
not only to youngsters, but also to business and civic groups. He teaches 
everything from the basics of knowing what railroad signs mean to how to safely 
evacuate a car or bus that is stuck on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Incarnation Principal Mary Krazkowski said the school requested the 
presentation after an Aug. 15 accident in which a young girl, her mother and 
grandfather were killed while taking an illegal shortcut across the tracks near 
Western Avenue in Glendale, just a few miles from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in kindergarten through eighth grade attended Jackson's program, and 
despite a few laughs provided by the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote, they seemed 
to get the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it very seriously," said sixth-grade student Janette Wilke. "You could 
really get hurt if you're not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he has been giving talks about railroad safety for two years, and 
some parents have told him they now get lectures from their children when they 
drive near railroad crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are telling mom and dad to obey the signals," he said. "They're 
educating their parents for us." STEVE RYFLE

 A formation of six vintage World War II AT-6 trainer planes flew above the 
playground at Gault Street Elementary School in Van Nuys on Thursday to the 
delight of more than 400 students who waved and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyover began a ceremony celebrating Van Nuys Airport's adoption of the 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the city's Adopt-A-School program, the airport, located just 
minutes from the campus, will provide the school with learning materials about 
aviation, field trips to the airport and a holiday program that may involve 
Santa Claus being airlifted via helicopter to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Manager Ron Kochevar said one of the goals of the adoption is to 
expose children to the different kinds of aviation careers besides that of 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the main goal is to help keep them interested in staying in school," 
Kochevar said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said officials hope that exciting books and tools about aviation will be an 
added incentive for students to continue their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Personifying the airport's hopes for Gault Street Elementary School was 
"Captain Aero" who, decked out in goggles and a scarf, made a visit during the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The super-hero told youngsters to "dare to dream" and gave out 
aviation-related toys such as milk caps with the Van Nuys Airport logo printed 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in one fifth-grade class attached notes with their names and the 
school's address to balloons, which they let go at the end of the adoption 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Walker, 10, said the students hope that someone will find the notes and 
write back to them. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GOLF TOURNEY AIDS DRUG, TEEN PROGRAMS 
</P>

<P>
 Golfers on the green Monday in Glendale will not only raise money for an 
alcohol and drug recovery program, but may also provide the funds to start up a 
program for help teen-agers in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament at the Oakmount Country Club is expected to raise at least 
$40,000 for the Glendale Adventist Alcohol and Drug Services, a recovery 
program. But the money also will help start up the Teen On Call program, which 
will be run by the Glendale Adventist Medical Center's community services 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is hoped to be a support group for teens," said Debby Evans, the 
hospital foundation's associate director. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will train teen-agers to be on call, by pager, 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week, to help their peers in crisis. Evans said that the program 
will have teen-agers trained as "active listeners" to find out what help their 
peers need and to make referrals.  
</P>
<P>
 "They will not counsel them," Evans said. "They will listen and help teens get 
the services they need." 
</P>
<P>
 The peer counselors will direct troubled teen-agers to local youth centers, 
family service and mental health organizations, as well as to Glendale police, 
for help. Problems anticipated are suicidal tendencies, drug addiction or 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it isn't as comfortable for them to go to an adult for help, but if 
they can get another teen-ager via a pager, they would be more willing," Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said hospital officials hope the Teen On Call program will be as 
successful as another community services program called PhoneFriend, which 
assists elementary school-age latchkey kids with school work and other 
problems. That program is getting ready to expand into other communities, 
including Burbank, Pasadena and Eagle Rock, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 160 golfers are expected to participate in Monday's 11th annual 
tournament to benefit the hospital foundation. Each golfer pays $250 to enter 
and three golfers who come closest to the pin on a designated hole will have a 
chance to win $1 million by getting a hole-in-one on the course's 165-yard 18th 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the foundation at (818) 409-8055. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; HOMEOWNERS APPEAL APPROVAL OF ANTENNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Encino homeowners has appealed the Los Angeles City Planning 
Commission's decision to allow a cellular phone antenna to exceed height limits 
atop a Ventura Boulevard office building. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second community action since August against Airtouch Cellular's 
project, Homeowners of Encino has filed a letter with the Los Angeles City 
Council that refutes justifications made by the Planning Commission to give the 
go-ahead to the project at 17547 Ventura Blvd. in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Airtouch Cellular wants to build a 10-foot antenna on top of the 42-foot-high 
office building. The Ventura-Cahuenga Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan has 
imposed 30-foot height requirements for all "new structures or additions or 
alterations to existing structures" within the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Stating that the plan, adopted in 1991, was conceived to help beautify Encino, 
homeowner Gary Davis disputed the Planning Commission's finding that the 
antenna project will maintain "a compatible and harmonious relationship between 
commercial uses and adjacent residential neighborhoods" in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The antennas and the dishes are the ugliest thing around," Davis said. "That 
building is already an eyesore. . . . They tried to justify the project by 
saying it is not that far off the old (municipal) code, which had height 
requirements of 42 feet. We're not interested in the old code; everyone should 
abide by the new requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a building is already over a new height limit," Davis added, "why have the 
audacity to go even higher?" 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a suggestion by Davis that the project simply be relocated to a 
nearby area that is zoned for multi-residential structures, Airtouch Cellular 
spokeswoman Melissa May said that the homeowners' protest appeared to be rooted 
in "NIMBYism" (Not In My Back Yard). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that a few individuals can attack a level of service in this 
way," May said. "This is an important area for us and our service is important 
to many people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the (Jan. 17 Northridge) earthquake, many people approached me and 
said, 'you were our only means of communication during that time.' Especially 
in this part of the world, people realize the value of cellular service." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the appeal, the City Council's Planning and Land Use Committee 
will conduct a public hearing on the project and make a final recommendation to 
the full City Council. No hearing date has been set. ANTONIO OLIVO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COMPUTERS HELP MOVE COMMUTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The information superhighway and the Los Angeles transportation system have 
merged in the form of a high-tech kiosk that offers up-to-the-minute tips on 
traffic conditions, car-pooling and bus-train scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Department, in conjunction with the Federal 
Highway Administration and other private and public organizations, has set up 
77 computers in supermarkets and shopping centers throughout Los Angeles in a 
yearlong test project costing $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 of the computers are in kiosks in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer stations are the first of their kind in the nation, Caltrans 
spokeswoman Patricia Reid said. The stations have also been distributed to 
locations in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the "Smart Traveler," the system takes the viewer through a 
step-by-step guide on how to use the information. By touching the screen, a map 
of the freeway system appears with color-coded dots indicating heavy traffic 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Another touch links the commuter with the names and numbers of people 
interested in car-pooling, based on where they live and where they work. The 
"Smart Traveler" also makes instant printouts of personalized bus and train 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said if the project is a success, other transportation information, such 
as park and ride listings and bike routes, will be included in later units.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; ANTI-SEMITISM FORUM STUCK FOR DEFINITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a workshop intended to bring more awareness about anti-Semitism to 
students of different ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But many students attending the event Thursday at Cal State Northridge were 
unable to get a clear definition of anti-Semitism from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 students showed up for "Responding to Anti-Semitism On Campus," the 
first meeting of its kind on the campus led by CSUN Jewish studies faculty 
members and representatives from the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights 
organization that combats anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry and 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of CSUN's Black Students Union, which represented nearly 25% 
of the entire group, questioned the purpose of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Price, president of the BSU, said she thought the meeting was 
"ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
 "They (moderators) failed to define anti-Semitism. They failed to address what 
we came to hear and understand." 
</P>
<P>
 "What racism is to blacks is what anti-Semitism is to Jews," said Jerry 
Goldstein, full-time rabbi on the CSUN campus. "Our hope is to develop a system 
for dealing with multicultural disagreements. This campus has no minority, just 
like the city of Los Angeles. We want this university to be a laboratory for 
working out multicultural differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Myers, director of CSUN's Jewish Studies Program, said the workshop was 
intended to help students explore their feelings, problems and strategies 
regarding anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoshanna Gershenzon, Jewish studies instructor, said that she expected 
certain groups who attended the meeting to feel uncomfortable, but that she 
believes it was a good way for students to begin understanding their own ethnic 
differences and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to focus on dealing with issues around bigotry by taking students 
to a more emotional rather than intellectual level," said Debra Stogel, ADL 
assistant director of training for the western states. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,730 anti-Semitic incidents in the United States were reported in 
1992, according to a nationwide survey released by the ADL. This figure, the 
second highest in the 14-year history of the survey, includes a 12% increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents on 60 college campuses throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Avi Burkwitz, a senior and history major, said the meeting was a "rehashing" 
of information he already knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be differences everywhere, and hostility wherever you go, no 
matter what race you are. The students in the BSU had every right to question 
the definition of anti-Semitism. . . . we (Jews) know what it means because 
we're Jewish. But others think it has a different meaning." ALICIA DOYLE

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: EARTHQUAKE DEBRIS REMOVAL EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With refuse from the Northridge earthquake still piling up after nine months, 
the city has extended its Earthquake Debris Removal Program to Jan. 17, 1995, 
the one-year anniversary of the devastating temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 While crews will be collecting the trash until mid-January, calls requesting 
pickups must be made to the program's hot line -- (800) 498-CITY -- by Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The free collection program was slated to end Sept. 30, but many whose homes 
were damaged are just now receiving insurance payments and hiring contractors 
to perform the cleanup, program spokeswoman Janet Ervin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, overloaded contractors are just now beginning jobs requested 
months ago. Just as much debris is being left curbside now as in the weeks 
after the quake -- more in some San Fernando Valley communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still getting about 500 calls a day," Ervin said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rainy season approaches, the city is asking that piles of debris be 
placed one foot from the curb so as not to impede storm runoff. That debris, 
though, must be related to the quake or it won't be picked up. "Some people get 
carried away in cleaning out their garages," Ervin said. "They see this as free 
garbage removal." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are asked to separate the refuse into piles of wood, concrete, 
stucco and other materials to simplify recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has spent $48 million to pick up over 1 million tons of 
curbside debris and another $21 million to dispose of it, Ervin said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that it takes an average of seven working days after a pickup call is 
placed before crews arrive to perform the work. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; LONG VACANT OFFICE BUILDING GETS TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warner Center Plaza III, a 25-story office building, has its first tenant 
after nearly three years of standing empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, PaineWebber stock brokerage moved into the ground floor of the 
585,000-square-foot tower at Oxnard Street and Owensmouth Avenue in Woodland 
Hills. PaineWebber is occupying 11,550 square feet of the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have the building open, to show brokerage and tenant companies 
there are opportunities . . . in the West Valley market," said John Gebhardt, 
senior vice president of the building's developer, Voit Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate broker Seth Dudley said that a number of factors made it difficult 
for Warner Center Plaza III to get tenants since it opened in November, 1991. 
In 1992, it competed for tenants with another Warner Center office building, 
also built by Voit, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The following year, according to Dudley, the building's owner was not actively 
seeking tenants because it was trying to sell the tower. The building was 
eventually sold to The New England life insurance company.  
</P>
<P>
 During the first half of this year, New England didn't lease the building 
because it was tied up in unsuccessful negotiations to lease it to 20th Century 
Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter of this year, Warner Center Plaza III accounted for 30.2% 
of the vacancy rate in West Valley office buildings, which was 20.1%, according 
to Stewart Day, head of research for brokerage Cushman & Wakefield of 
California Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Broker Mike Zugsmith said that New England appeared to be softening its 
initial stance that it only wanted to lease the building to a company that 
would occupy all of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that financial considerations, and their inability to obtain a tenant 
of the size they wanted have forced the ownership to adjust to the market," 
Zugsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zugsmith and Dudley said that New England's prospects of finding more tenants 
are good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect the building to be half leased in the next six months," Dudley said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; FRAN PAVLEY NAMED TO STATE LEAGUE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura Hills Councilwoman Fran Pavley has been named president-elect of the 
Los Angeles County Division of the League of California Cities, an organization 
dedicated to promoting the interests of the state's cities. 
</P>
<P>
 She will serve as president-elect until next September, when she will replace 
the organization's president, Paul Richards of Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley, 45, a teacher at Chaparral Middle School in Moorpark, was elected 
treasurer of the Los Angeles County division two years ago. A year later she 
was installed vice president of the organization, which has 470 member cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The division, which represents 86 cities, is considered to be the most 
influential branch of the organization, said Kim Chudoba, the division's 
executive director. It's also the most diverse because the cities vary 
significantly in terms of ethnic makeup and residents' incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, with Pavley's help, has been working to build consensus 
among those diverse groups, Chudoba said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fran is highly respected," she said. "I think she is perceived as being very 
thoughtful and deliberative. She's someone that people have a lot of confidence 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a challenge," Pavley said. "But I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the priorities of the League of California Cities is to limit the 
amount of funds that the state takes away from cities to pay its own bills, 
Pavley said. Over the last three years, Agoura Hills has lost $1.4 million, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league is very effective in providing a strong united force to minimize 
those kinds of raids on city funds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to ease the financial burden on fiscally strapped cities, the 
league is lobbying the state to provide more money to cities to operate 
state-mandated programs, Pavley said.  
</P>
<P>
 The league also is seeking ways to provide long-term funding for the county's 
libraries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley was first elected to the City Council in 1982. She recently announced 
that she will not seek that office again when her term expires in three years.

U.S., STATE EXTEND DEADLINE TO SEEK EARTHQUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal and state officials Thursday extended the deadline to apply for 
earthquake aid from Oct. 17 to Nov. 17, despite appeals from Los Angeles city 
officials to push the deadline all the way to the first anniversary of the 
temblor in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension was granted, state and federal officials said, because many 
victims are only now learning the extent of damage and finding out how much of 
the repairs their insurance will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline applies to aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the 
Small Business Administration and the state's Individual and Family Grant 
Program. It had previously been extended from Sept. 17 to Oct. 17, the most 
recent of several extensions. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who last week asked for an extension to Jan. 17, said the 
one-month delay will help many victims apply for aid. But some officials said 
they plan on pressing for yet more time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than nothing, but I don't think it's sufficient time and I will 
continue to keep pressing for the Jan. 17 deadline," City Controller Rick 
Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan, who wrote to state officials Sept. 30 
asking for the Jan. 17 extension, was more diplomatic, saying the mayor would 
ask for another extension only if it is clear that quake victims need more 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to work with the federal government to make sure that 
together we can do what we can to get benefits to the people who need them," 
Riordan spokeswoman Noelia Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials would not rule out another extension but said they would grant 
additional delays only if the number of applications filed with federal 
disaster centers remains high. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the deadline approaches, we will continue to analyze the need for an 
extension as we go along," FEMA spokesman Russ Edmonston said. "We felt at this 
point that a month is sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, federal disaster officials have received more than 637,000 requests 
for aid. During the past few weeks, 700 to 800 quake victims have applied for 
federal aid each day, Edmonston said. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal and local officials urged quake victims not to delay in filing, 
warning that another extension may not be granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage those applicants who still have not filed their SBA disaster 
loan applications to use this extension to quickly complete and submit their 
applications," SBA branch manager John Brenner said. "If you don't apply, we 
can't help you."

 America's oldest teen-ager is taking the world's biggest electric guitar home 
to a rock 'n' roll hangout in the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitar, all 38 feet and 1,865 pounds of it, was hoisted onto a flatbed 
truck Thursday for transportation to Indianapolis for rock-biz godfather Dick 
Clark, who plans to hang it from the ceiling in a restaurant he owns there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging it from the ceiling is a lot easier than playing it. 
</P>
<P>
 It does work, but coaxing a tune out of the behemoth box involves six players 
-- three to depress the strings and three more to pluck or strum them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who bought the guitar last year from the Jasonville, Ind., high school 
students who built it as a class project that got them into the Guinness Book 
of World Records, took it out of storage recently to display it in his new 
Indianapolis restaurant, Dick Clark's American Bandstand Grill. It will join a 
collection of rock memorabilia there that includes John Lennon's shoes, James 
Brown's cape and one of the beaded gloves worn by Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've saved everything in the world," said Clark, 64, the longtime host of 
television's "American Bandstand," cradle of much of the rock music of the 
1950s and '60s and foundation stone of Clark's entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a collector. I value these things, (even) the doors of dressing rooms. 
It's the world's largest guitar and the double whammy is we're sending it back 
whence it came," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was built in Indiana and it's going back to Indiana to a place that 
commemorates American music." 
</P>
<P>
 The red-and-white "Flying V" guitar, similar to those played by the late Jimi 
Hendrix, was built for $400 in 1991 as a class project by about 50 students at 
Shakamak High School. The body is pine, and the strings were custom-made. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark bought the guitar for thousands of dollars -- he won't say how much -- 
after reading about the student project in a newspaper. "I got hold of the 
teacher and said I'd find a good home for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has used it only once, as a backdrop for the 40th anniversary 
show of "American Bandstand." 
</P>
<P>
 It took three days and five people to load the electric guitar onto the 
truck's trailer at Clark's Burbank production offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Truck driver Ted Rea and his wife, Shari, are making the cross-country journey 
for Clark, and will haul back the guitar's protective green tarp to show it off 
only at the other Dick Clark American Bandstand grills in Overland Park, Kan., 
and Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last minute Thursday, Rea and others were forced to dismantle part of 
the guitar in order to drive safely under overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing I'm worried about is the wind," said Rea, sweating 
profusely from the labor of lashing down the two-story guitar. When it comes to 
catching the wind, "It's like a billboard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitar is expected to arrive in Indianapolis Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark will be on hand to greet it, as will its builders, said a spokeswoman 
for Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, they will pluck its giant strings, playing it through six 
amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The song? Most likely "Peter Gunn" and "Smoke on the Water," the tunes they 
played to get into the Guinness Book of World Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate in pulling strings to get into show business.

PATIENT SAYS PHYSICIAN SEXUALLY ABUSED HER; INVESTIGATION: HIDDEN HILLS DOCTOR 
DENIES THE ALLEGATION. HE SAYS SHE MADE IT UP AFTER READING AN ARTICLE ON 
MISCONDUCT.

<P>
 A family-practice doctor who is also a Hidden Hills city councilman has been 
accused of sexually abusing a female patient during a gynecological exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. H. Brian Herdeg, 64, was charged with having intercourse and fondling the 
breasts of a patient who came to his Woodland Hills office for a Pap smear in 
1992, according to the Medical Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Herdeg denied the accusation, saying the woman was not in his 
office at the time she claims and that she fabricated the charges after reading 
a magazine article about physicians who engage in sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be a hallucination," said Herdeg. "If she in her mind believes it 
happened, it may be awfully hard to un-hallucinate her." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified in a medical board complaint only as S.M., arrived at 
Herdeg's office about 5 p.m. on Nov. 13, 1992, for a Pap smear, according to 
state investigators. Shortly after she got there, Herdeg's receptionist left 
the office, the state accusation said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herdeg took the patient into an examination room, asked her to lie on a table 
and proceeded to conduct a breast exam. During the exam, he fondled both of the 
woman's breasts, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the doctor asked the woman to place her feet in the exam table's 
stirrups and had intercourse with her, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman tried to sit up, but the doctor yelled, "Don't move! If you just 
close your eyes you'll be able to relax." Afraid for her safety, the patient 
laid back down, the state complaint contends. 
</P>
<P>
 About two minutes later, Herdeg withdrew from the woman, picked up a chart 
from a counter, smiled at her and left his office, according to the complaint. 
The patient put on her clothes and left too. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon Arnett, the medical board's executive director, said in the complaint 
that Herdeg's alleged actions constitute sexual abuse and misconduct and should 
result in his medical license being revoked or suspended. Herdeg is also 
charged with incompetence, dishonesty and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Herdeg, a 1962 graduate of UC Irvine medical school, has served since 1984 on 
the City Council of Hidden Hills, a wealthy, gated enclave just west of 
Woodland Hills. From 1990 to 1992, he was the city's mayor. He has also has 
been president of the Hidden Hills Homeowners Assn. and a member of the city 
Public Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Herdeg acknowledged that the woman has been a patient of his for 14 years but 
denied that the alleged abuse took place. He said he plans to sue her for 
defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient was not in my office on the day in question, or for that matter 
at any time in November, 1992," he said, reading from a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both my wife, who is my office manager, and my back-office medical assistant 
were in the office on the date and time in question and confirm that the 
allegations are completely fraudulent." 
</P>
<P>
 Herdeg said he did see the patient on "subsequent occasions" between the 
beginning of December, 1992, and May, 1993. But he said he has "never performed 
a gynecological exam on any patient without a chaperone present." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 35-year record that has been clean up to this moment," he said, 
adding that the state has never targeted him for disciplinary action before. A 
medical board spokeswoman confirmed that no other charges have been filed 
against him since he received his doctor's license in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Herdeg said that the woman contacted the medical board after reading a 1993 
article in Redbook magazine about an Alaska doctor who raped several patients 
before he finally confessed to the crimes during a taped telephone conversation 
with one victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The article said that in 1992, 120 U.S. doctors had their licenses revoked or 
restricted because of sexual misconduct with patients, double the number in 
1991.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 87 TRUANTS PICKED UP IN A SWEEP; EDUCATION: 
PARENTS ARE DISMAYED OVER CHILDREN'S CONDUCT, BUT SOME OF THOSE TAKEN IN HAD 
LEGITIMATE EXCUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eighty-seven truant high school students were picked up Thursday morning in a 
sweep by sheriff's deputies and probation officers across the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said some of them were found at fast-food restaurants, convenience 
markets and doughnut shops, while others were seen simply strolling near their 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters were taken to the Palmdale offices of United Community Action 
Network, where staff members and volunteers summoned parents or other adults to 
pick them up. While waiting, the young people sat through motivational lectures 
about the importance of education and the dangers of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 UCAN, a nonprofit organization that offers counseling for troubled teen-agers, 
is run by retired sheriff's deputy Billy Pricer, who is also president of the 
Antelope Valley Union High School District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies and probation officers used metal detectors to check the youngsters 
but found no weapons. Several admitted they had been smoking marijuana, but 
none possessed illegal drugs when they were picked up, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents arriving at the UCAN center appeared to be dismayed over their 
children's conduct, but several said they were glad that deputies had conducted 
the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry at my daughter, but I think it's a great idea," said Linda Krumlish 
of Palmdale, who was called because her child had skipped classes at Highland 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer said Thursday's truancy sweep was the first conducted during this 
school year. Three were done last year, and one the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school district, which receives state funding according to its 
daily attendance, loses money when youngsters skip classes. What's more, he 
said, truancy contributes to crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest cause of daytime burglaries is kids out of school," Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Rich, director of pupil personnel services for the school district, said 
a preliminary review showed that 87 of the youngsters picked up Thursday were 
truants. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a few others rounded up in the four-hour sweep had legitimate excuses 
to be off campus, including outside jobs and sports commitments or were 
non-students who were not carrying sufficient identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich said Thursday's roundup indicated that truancy may be declining. A 
similar sweep lasting only two hours last year netted 101 youngsters, he said. 
The decline may be the result of a new policy that says students may be forced 
to repeat a grade if they miss more than 15 days a year for any reason, Richard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truants picked up on Thursday were about evenly divided between boys and 
girls. Most were supposed to be attending classes in four high schools: 
Antelope Valley, Highland, Quartz Hill and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the truants was Aymin McGhee, who said he was picked up outside Antelope 
Valley High while walking home to change his shoelaces, which he said did not 
comply with the school's dress regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unfair," he said. But he added: "It taught me a lesson -- not to leave 
school again." 
</P>
<P>
 At the UCAN office, he was picked up by his brother, Samuel Mears, 20, who 
said he did not object to the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's cool," Mears said. "I like this. When I was at Antelope Valley High, 
they just used to let us go." 
</P>
<P>
 The truants picked up on Thursday also included 10 students who were on 
probation for past criminal violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Laich, a county probation supervisor who took part in the sweep, said 
these students may receive a warning or could be placed in a detention center 
if they have recorded other probation violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of them understand that they should have been in school," Laich 
said. "They got caught, and these are the consequences."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; OVERPASS NAMED FOR QUAKE VICTIM; MEMORIAL: 
FAMILY, FRIENDS AND OFFICIALS REMEMBER THE LAPD OFFICER WHO DIED AT FREEWAY 
INTERCHANGE. 
</P>

 Calling him a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice in his effort to serve the 
public, officials Thursday honored the LAPD motorcycle officer who fell to his 
death from the collapsed Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange 
during the Northridge earthquake by giving the rebuilt overpass his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Wayne Dean, a 26-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, 
was rushing on his police motorcycle from his home in Lancaster to report for 
emergency duty when he drove off the severed freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 With the interchange in the background, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
and Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams unveiled the first of three 
signs that are being erected this month to mark the "Clarence Wayne Dean 
Memorial Interchange." 
</P>
<P>
 "While many of us were literally shaking in our homes, wondering what was 
going to come next, Officer Dean's first thoughts were of his job and serving 
the people of Los Angeles," Katz said, speaking to an audience of about 100 
LAPD officers gathered near the sign on the shoulder of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry I never got a chance to meet Officer Dean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz sponsored the resolution to rename the interchange after he was 
approached by the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which is paying for the 
three markers. State lawmakers approved the measure in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Williams praised Dean as demonstrating the best qualities of an LAPD 
officer, and admonished critics of the department to remember that officers 
sometimes perform the "ultimate sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 "As we travel these roads," Williams said, "let us always remember Clarence 
Wayne Dean." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, attended by the officer's family and friends, included a 
processional led by 46 motorcycle officers, many of whom briefly sounded their 
sirens as they passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several motorists, noticing the sign and large group of police officers, 
honked and waved as they drove by. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Dean, the officer's mother, was presented with the Assembly resolution. 
She spoke briefly, fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a wonderful son, officer, friend, to so many people," she said. "He 
will be missed. He has been missed for several months." 
</P>
<P>
 The two other signs are to be installed along the Golden State Freeway this 
week by the California Department of Transportation.
