 DRYING OFF: Families are taking back Orange County beaches. . . . During the 
summer of 1992, the Department of Parks and Recreation responded to growing 
violence at Huntington and Bolsa Chica state beaches by banning alcohol and 
closing beach-front parking lots at 10 p.m. Results of a just-completed survey 
show that the crime rate is down and fewer beach-goers are being hurt in 
accidents. . . . "The parks' personality has changed from a place to party to a 
family beach," said lifeguard Herb White. Last year, 7.1 million people visited 
Orange County's state beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 SHIFTING SANDS: Mother Nature doesn't get all the credit for Orange County's 
42 miles of picture-perfect beaches. Every five to seven years, crews must 
replace sand that gets swept away during winter storms. . . . This past winter 
was mild so little sand was lost. During restoration, crews dredge 1.8 million 
cubic yards of sand from offshore and drop it on Sunset Beach. Summer tides 
carry the sand to replenish southward beaches. The next major refurbishing: 
spring of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 THE AD END: Ever wondered how to get that message across to your special 
person? Take him or her to the beach this summer and hire a banner-towing plane 
to make your statement. . . . Doug Stavoe, owner of Newport Beach-based Pacific 
Drifters Corp., has some advice for first-time advertisers: "Keep it clean and 
straight-forward. You don't want to put a book up there." 
</P>
<P>
 PICK IT UP: Cub Scout Pack 284 in Huntington Beach knows how to have a good 
time and earn a merit badge in the process. Saturday mornings, the pack's 65 
members police their adopted stretch of beach in downtown Huntington Beach. . . 
. "On a typical day we'll fill five or six bags of trash," said pack mom Janet 
Jackson. "The boys love the excuse to go to the beach and it's a real community 
service." . . . For the name of the nearest adoptable beach, call (800)

 Crime and injuries have dropped since June, 1992, when alcohol was prohibited 
and a 10 p.m. curfew was set for Huntington and Bolsa Chica state beaches.

AMERICA'S D-DAY ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How dare The Times print such un-American hogwash as that written by Alexander 
Cockburn, "A Smidgen of Perspective on D-Day" (Column Left, June 3). 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sad fact that many Americans with 70-pound packs were dumped in deep 
water and drowned at Omaha Beach. But this had nothing to do with them carrying 
cartons of cigarettes. The fact is, many of the coxswains on the landing crafts 
lost their nerve and, rather than go onto the beach, which was being sprayed 
with heavy cross-fire from the German defenders, lowered their ramps more than 
300 yards out in deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cockburn to refer to D-day as "a sideshow" and "a skirmish" is a slap in 
the face to every American who ever wore the uniform of the United States of 
America, not to mention the hundreds of brave, young men who lost their lives 
on the beaches of Normandy 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT L. WEST 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cockburn's sneering references to the deaths of U.S. soldiers at Omaha Beach 
are incredibly mean-spirited, and his glowing accolades for the prowess of the 
Red Army are the pathetic utterances of an apologist for the Soviet Union's 
amoral conduct prior to its becoming a fervent member of the war against 
fascism.  
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union became the victim of Nazi aggression in June, 1941, which 
caused it to insistently ask the British and then the Americans to open a 
second front, precisely because it had collaborated in Hitler's aggression in 
1939. Has Cockburn forgotten the Soviet-German nonaggression pact, under which 
the same Red Army that later "liberated" Eastern Europe from the Nazis had 
invaded Poland from the east shortly after the Germans stormed in from the 
west? If Stalin had instead joined with Britain and France (which belatedly but 
genuinely sought an alliance with him), Germany would not have been able to 
quickly overrun Poland, vanquish France and isolate Britain, leaving Hitler 
free to pursue his genocidal plans for the inhabitants of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler cleverly avoided direct provocation of the U.S. and did not declare war 
against the U.S. until Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. It was not a foregone 
conclusion that the U.S. would follow a "Germany first" approach; it could have 
become U.S. policy to let the Nazis and the Soviets destroy each other while 
Pearl Harbor and Bataan were avenged. While it may have been Churchill's fear 
of Soviet domination of Europe that finally caused him to agree to the opening 
of the second front, it should also be remembered that he was so wary of large 
casualties that he desired to attack through Europe's "soft underbelly," while 
it was the Americans who insisted upon a head-on attack on Fortress Europe. 
Furthermore, even if the invasion of France might itself have been insufficient 
to win the war, it kept enough German divisions tied down to enable the Red 
Army to overwhelm the Germans. As late as December, 1944, Hitler still 
squandered his troops in the Battle of the Bulge at the same time that the 
Russians were relentlessly closing on Berlin.

The only fight we had was to survive the horrors of Hitler. But to the 
surviving heroes, I and the free nations thank you for helping us breathe free.

 In response to Michael Kinsley's apologistic Column Left regarding President 
Clinton's avoidance of military service in Vietnam (June 2), the fact remains 
that many Americans, from the inner-city youth to the rural farmer, the sons 
and daughters of working-class America, fought and died in that conflict, and, 
whether too naive or too proud, they did not seek out exemptions from military 
service. For these individuals, Woodstock and protest marches were not a 
high-water mark for their generation. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of a century later, a hypothetical justification that the war was 
"morally wrong" and "the country ultimately decided that Bill Clinton was 
right" stated as some type of moral high ground for Bill Clinton's evasion of 
the draft is fallacy. 
</P>
<P>
 A reading of names engraved on the Vietnam Memorial reflects the regional and 
ethnic diversity of Americans who died in that conflict. Having known and 
served in Vietnam with some of these individuals, I know that their military 
service came from a sense of duty and a personal code that would not permit 
another of their generation to stand in harm's way in their stead. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take more than rhetorical courage during a D-day speech for Bill 
Clinton to show that his avoidance of military service was more than 
self-serving elitism. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The main issue is not being addressed -- either by President Clinton or the 
media. There is no comparison between the Vietnam War and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was not alone in protesting against the Vietnam War. But he needs to 
"stand and deliver" now and stop feeling ashamed of those beliefs, which makes 
us feel ashamed. I, too, was against U.S. involvement in Vietnam but I have 
great compassion for those who served there and for those who lost their loved 
ones.

TAX INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to what Lenny Goldberg's commentary in The Times ("Bamboozled by 
Business Tax Breaks," June 2,) implied, tax incentives designed to attract new 
businesses and to retain existing businesses are an integral part of a state's 
overall economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys or studies cited by Goldberg are misleading and manipulated to 
understate California's tax burden. For example, they do not see total costs of 
doing business in California (such as the explosion of local taxes and fees), 
and therefore are not an accurate reflection of tax burden compared to other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 When deciding where to locate, companies give considerable weight to 
incentives offered by competing states. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the growing problem of California-headquartered companies being 
wooed by other states, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has introduced a 6% 
investment tax credit for business location or expansion of headquarters in 
California. The Speaker's office has provided testimony that this investment 
tax credit will generate more than $150 million in state revenues over four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson, the California Chamber of Commerce, the Los Angeles Economic 
Development Corp. and a host of economists support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, California has lagged behind competitor states in providing the kind 
of tax environment that is warranted in today's economy. In the spirit of 
improving the state's economy, incentives to create and maintain jobs are 
absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 President, Cal-Tax 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 
</P>
<P>
 It is no wonder that Goldberg is under the impression that businesses are 
happy as clams in Southern California and need no assistance -- he lives in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if Goldberg visited us once in awhile, he would realize that 
California's high-tax, highly regulated business climate offers all too many 
disincentives for businesses to stay in the state. The better the incentive 
package, the more likely a business is to choose that state when relocating or 
expanding. By way of specific example in Orange County, since 1989, 81 
companies or divisions of companies have moved out of the state, costing a job 
loss to the county of 13,700 direct employment positions. Countless other 
workers in support industries were also impacted by the loss of those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 When strong businesses leave the state for better opportunities elsewhere, who 
is left to pay the costs of government but the overburdened individual 
taxpayer. Let's not be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We need to keep our jobs 
here in California.

IMMIGRATION LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is suing the federal government regarding illegal 
immigration, blaming them for not enforcing the immigration laws. I'm an 
American citizen living in Redondo beach married to an Indonesian living in 
Indonesia.I'm being put in a situation by the federal government to leave this 
country in order to be with my wife because of strict immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 With the current immigration laws regarding marriage, it is impossible to 
obtain a visitor visa for my wife while we are applying for residency. After 
three months of haggling with the INS over proper pictures my wife must submit 
with her application, we are still nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to be with my wife, I must travel to Indonesia and live with her 
there until this situation straightens out. I am being forced to quit my job 
and give up my immediate future in the U.S.A. Eventually we will be together in 
America, but by then all the money saved for my future will be spent waiting on 
a flawed bureaucratic system. Maybe when we get back here, we'll be forced to 
go on welfare, one of the things the government is trying to prevent with 
strict immigration laws.

HOW TO MAKE CURFEWS WORK; CAREFULLY DRAWN LAWS WILL STAND UP, U.S. SUPREME 
COURT RULING INDICATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to let stand a Dallas curfew law 
should energize law enforcement agencies in other cities trying to get a handle 
on escalating teen-age crime. In particular, it should encourage a promising 
effort in East Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Three Texas youths and their parents had challenged the Dallas curfew, 
generally requiring those under 17 to be off the streets after 11 p.m. on 
weekdays and after midnight on weekends. They contended that the city law 
"convicts the innocent . . . and broadly stifles fundamental liberties." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal appeals court and now the Supreme Court have disagreed. In 
November, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Dallas law is 
justified by the city's "compelling interest" in reducing juvenile crime and in 
"promoting juvenile safety and well-being." It cited statistics showing that 
murders and assaults occur most often between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. The high court 
dismissed without comment the plaintiffs' appeal from the 5th Circuit.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas law withstood legal challenge in part because it was so carefully 
drawn. It exempts minors accompanied by a parent or guardian, and those out 
after hours because of an emergency or to attend work or school. Children can 
also be outside after curfew if they remain in front of their home or a 
neighbor's.  
</P>
<P>
 Similar curfew laws now exist in Los Angeles, Norwalk, Inglewood, Huntington 
Beach, Thousand Oaks, Walnut Park, Santa Monica and Long Beach. The Supreme 
Court's decision is not binding on them but it does strongly signal that the 
justices will not strike down curfews as broadly unconstitutional. That's good. 
But a law alone is not enough.  
</P>
<P>
 To be effective in keeping teen-agers from becoming the victims or the 
perpetrators of crime, curfews demand a major commitment of time and resources 
by law enforcement officials, parents and community leaders. Yet that 
commitment can -- and sadly, does -- waver in the face of more pressing police 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 In East Los Angeles, a somewhat different approach seems to be helping. A 10 
p.m.-to-dawn curfew for juveniles has been on the books for many years in 
unincorporated parts of the county. Since January, the Sheriff's Department has 
begun to ticket violators -- rather than arrest and jail them, which is far 
more labor-intensive. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of fining them a hefty $675, the county gives parents of curfew 
violators a tool to intervene constructively in their kids' lives by requiring 
them to attend a one-month class on peaceful ways to resolve conflict. So far, 
about 40 families have enrolled. The Sheriff's Department reports that crime in 
the area has dipped under the new approach and that the number of minors 
loitering after dark has dramatically declined.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of innovative effort that can really pay off.

INVADING HAITI: BUT JUST HOW LONG DO WE WANT TO STAY?; SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT -- 
THE LAST U.S. INTERVENTION THERE LASTED 19 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Clinton Administration seriously thinking of using U.S. military 
power to end the political crisis in Haiti, some critics are pointing out that 
a similar U.S. military intervention there -- from 1915 to 1934 -- did little 
good and even may have contributed to the problems that nation faces today. 
Although too glib, that argument does have some merit. Clearly Washington needs 
to ponder Haiti's history before intervening there again -- if only to keep 
U.S. policy-makers sharply aware of the towering amount of work that would 
remain even after the Marines ousted the junta in Port-au-Prince. The Elites 
That Have Always Ruled the Troubled Nation: 
</P>
<P>
 Today's divided Haitian society, with its small urban elite reluctant to cede 
power to a poor peasant majority, dates to 1804 when the former French colony 
won independence after a long slave revolt. The majority of former slaves chose 
to settle as independent farmers in rural areas. A few wealthy families tried 
to re-create the French plantation system but failed. Other members of the 
elite managed to take control of the foreign trade centered in the capital and 
used their financial clout to control the government, which included two new 
sources of wealth and power -- the military and the tax system. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations political turmoil was largely limited to infighting among the 
elite over the spoils of government power. That turmoil generated the crisis 
that led President Woodrow Wilson to order in the Marines. The 19-year U.S. 
administration in Haiti helped further consolidate political power in 
Port-au-Prince. Marine trainers improved the Haitian army. U.S. military 
engineers built new roads that allowed the government -- usually through the 
army -- to reach all parts of the nation for the first time. Centralized power 
was well-established when in 1956 the government came under the control of the 
brutal dictator Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, whose family would rule the small 
nation as a corrupt fiefdom for the next 30 years. The Duvaliers co-opted the 
members of the elite whom they could not terrorize as they did the poor masses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duvalier regime collapsed in 1986 when the dictator's heirs fled to a 
prosperous exile. The current standoff in Haiti -- between the exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and a clique of military and police officers who ousted 
him in 1991 -- is arguably only the latest painful twist in the aftermath of 
the Duvalier regime. And a Novel Political Fact -- the Democratically Conducted 
Aristide Election: 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a difference this time, and it is a vitally important one to 
anyone who truly believes in the necessity of democracy for trouble-plagued 
Haiti. Aristide was overwhelmingly elected in the most open and honest election 
ever held there. More than 67% of voters cast ballots for the controversial 
former Roman Catholic priest. Perhaps as important for the United States, the 
nine months of Aristide's presidency were the only time in the last few years 
when illegal immigration from Haiti to this country declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, no solution to Haiti's woes can exclude Aristide. The challenge is to 
convince Haiti's military -- and the elite that supports it, precisely because 
it mistrusts Aristide -- of this fact. The military has refused every effort to 
work out an arrangement for Aristide's return, even a carefully crafted 
diplomatic formula signed under U.N. auspices in 1993. That is why some in the 
White House and Congress now want Marines in Haiti -- only this time just long 
enough to oust the junta that is keeping out the legitimately elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, a great power like the United States can never rule out the 
military option. But before such a heavy-handed approach is used, every effort 
must be made to oust the junta through non-military pressure, like the economic 
sanctions imposed recently by the United Nations and the Organization of 
American States. Perhaps when they are hit hard enough in the pocketbook the 
Haitian economic elite will withdraw their support from a leadership composed 
of military thugs and shift it, however grudgingly, to the most popular 
president in Haiti's modern history. An awesome challenge of nation building 
would still remain for President Aristide, but at least he would be able to 
face it without the inevitable complications, and bitter aftertaste, of a U.S. 
military intervention.

AN END TO DITHERING THAT COSTS LIVES; TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY ORDERS PROBE OF 
FAA ON 757 WAKE-DANGER DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena has come down decisively on the side of 
air safety over the needs of commerce by ordering a review of the Federal 
Aviation Administration's delay in issuing pilot warnings and rules about 
severe turbulence kicked up in the wake of Boeing 757 airliners. That 
turbulence was listed as a factor in a small-plane crash last December at 
Orange County's John Wayne airport that killed five people and a similar 1992 
crash in Montana that killed eight people. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena's welcome action follows a Times investigation that found the agency had 
been credibly warned about the 757 turbulence by 1990. But the logical action 
-- increasing the distance between the 757 and other planes on takeoff and 
landing -- would have reduced the number of flights at busy airports, costing 
the industry money. 
</P>
<P>
 True, all regulatory agencies face tension between the health of the regulated 
industry and the good of the consumer, but the margin for error in commercial 
air travel is a lot smaller than in rail travel or manufacturing. Safety issues 
absolutely cannot be put aside. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unusual for a transportation secretary to order this sort of review at 
the FAA, but the agency -- which increased separations between the 757 and 
other craft only two weeks ago -- clearly mishandled the turbulence issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Much good can come of this review, including discipline against officials 
responsible for ignoring the evidence about 757s, and a search for other 
possibly buried safety issues before they kill people.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching and reading the D-day accounts has had the effect that reading "The 
Diary of Anne Frank" had on me. Thanks to the media, I care deeply about these 
former soldiers who until now have been a part of a mysterious mass of older 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who fought in World War II are the strong, silent ones; the ones who 
are my father's age; the ones who would never let on what they were feeling.  
</P>
<P>
 Seeing those guys revisit Omaha Beach, stare across vast fields of crosses and 
stars of David and walk along hedgerows has changed me. I've seen more feeling 
and expression from older and mostly white men in the last few weeks than I had 
in my entire life up to this point. I understand that generation more now, and 
I'm better for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Ambrose, the D-day historian, related on a PBS special that the most 
common GI prayer was, "Dear Lord, please don't let me let my buddies down." 
It's a prayer that should be prayed by more of us now.

PERSPECTIVE ON HOMELESSNESS; REALLY CHEAP HOUSING ON THE BOTTOM RUNG; A CUBICLE 
WITH A LOCK BEATS THE STREET OR THE PREDATORY OPEN SPACES OF MANY SHELTERS. AND 
EXCHANGING WORK FOR A ROOM IS BETTER THAN PANHANDLING.

Northwestern University, is the author of The Homeless (Harvard University

<TEXT>
<P>
 Homelessness in the United States has at least tripled since 1980. Yet 
reversing this trend would not be as hard as most politicians pretend, so long 
as we concentrate on getting the homeless off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The causes of increased homelessness are many. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s, we stopped putting the homeless mentally ill in hospitals; 
that alone put about 100,000 people with serious mental problems on the streets 
by the end of the 1980s. We also tried to curb out-of-wedlock births by letting 
welfare benefits lag behind inflation, with a predictable result: By the end of 
the 1980s, roughly 50,000 single mothers and their children were living in 
shelters on an average night. But the biggest reason for increased homelessness 
is declining demand for unskilled workers. Their situation has deteriorated 
since the 1960s. It got much worse in the early 1980s and did not improve when 
the economy recovered. Millions of unskilled adults can no longer find a steady 
job that pays enough to support a family. Whenever that happens, some of the 
losers reject the work ethic and take to drink or drugs. Some also begin to 
support themselves by theft rather than work. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies in New York and Philadelphia found that 3% of the population 
used shelters at some time between 1988 and 1992. The Clinton Administration 
recently concluded that about 7 million Americans had been homeless at some 
time between 1985 and 1990. Most were homeless for short periods, so the 
nightly count averaged "only" 350,000 to 600,000. But homelessness is now an 
integral part of American poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The only known long-term cure for these problems is to make the rewards of 
work more equal. But America is not moving in that direction. Union protection 
for unskilled workers has all but disappeared, Congress has let the purchasing 
power of the minimum wage fall and free trade is forcing many manufacturers to 
cut real wages or move overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 So how can we help the homeless? The Clinton Administration plans to ask 
Congress for another $900 million to help cities like Los Angeles rehouse the 
homeless. That should help. But the Administration wants cities to spend a lot 
of this money on therapeutic programs for the mentally ill and the chemically 
addicted homeless. This would make sense if successful treatment usually led to 
economic self-sufficiency. But unskilled workers now have trouble earning 
enough to live on even when they are sane and sober. As a result, relapse rates 
are high. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's economy, we need more modest goals. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Americans, the top priority is to clear the streets. The police 
cannot do this alone, because they have nowhere else to send the homeless. So 
we have to give the homeless alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1950s, the poorest of the poor often lived in skid-row flophouses, 
where they could rent a windowless 5-by-6-foot cubicle for as little as 50 
cents a night (about $2 in today's money). These were awful places, but almost 
everyone preferred them to the free shelters run by evangelists. A cubicle of 
one's own was a refuge from strangers, a place to leave one's possessions and 
was accessible 24 hours a day. Nor did flophouses try to improve their 
residents' character. 
</P>
<P>
 As incomes rose, the old flophouses lost patrons and were torn down. Most 
cities also adopted building codes barring new ones. At the time, no one asked 
what would happen if extreme poverty began to spread again. When that happened, 
cities had nowhere to send the destitute. So they hoped the problem would prove 
temporary and tried to herd the homeless into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters have two big defects. To begin with, big shelters where lots of 
people share a single room can never take everyone off the street at night. If 
shelters admit all comers, as they do in New York, predatory criminals will 
target the weak and the mentally deranged will often make sleeping impossible. 
As a result, a large fraction of the homeless will stay on the streets. 
Recognizing this, most private shelters exclude people who have caused trouble 
in the past or who are hallucinating, drunk or high on drugs. But that policy 
also leaves nearly half the homeless on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem with shelters is that they seldom reduce daytime 
homelessness, which is what most worries the public. Almost all shelters evict 
residents during the day, hoping they will look for jobs. Lacking work, most 
have to spend the day in public places, where their presence upsets everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 If we want to clear the streets, we have to offer everyone some private space 
of their own, like the old cubicle hotels. And if we want public support, we 
also have to ask the able-bodied homeless to do some work in return. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest and cheapest solution would be to organize a day-labor market 
under public auspices. Anyone could show up early in the morning. If no private 
employer wanted to hire them, they would be entitled to four hours of public 
employment. In return, they would get vouchers for a cubicle and three cheap 
meals, plus a few dollars in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying mainly with vouchers rather than with cash would keep jobless adults in 
conventional housing from swamping the system. Vouchers would also assure 
skeptical taxpayers that their money was not going for drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a system is no substitute for good jobs at decent pay, but it is 
something we could afford to do right now. Because we can, we should.

A RICH MEDITATION ON OLD AGE, FIRST LOVE AND TRAGIC LOSS; THE PRINCE OF WEST

 The year is 1978, and the residents of the Emma Lazarus retirement home are 
planning an ambitious in-house production of "Hamlet."  
</P>
<P>
 They're a spirited crew despite advancing age and encroaching infirmity, and 
although their theatrical backgrounds run a short gamut from nonexistent to 
sketchy, the drama society performs only the classics. Last year's "Romeo and 
Juliet" was a triumph, even after Romeo fell after killing Tybalt and had to be 
carried off-stage on a stretcher. But as our narrator Otto Korner tells us, you 
have to make allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, making allowances may not be quite enough. The man who was 
to have played Hamlet has just died and a substitute must be found at once. 
Still, the people who live at Emma Lazarus are experienced at dealing with 
adversity.  
</P>
<P>
 Several of the cast members fled Europe just before the war, while others were 
not so fortunate and barely escaped with their lives. To them, a dead Hamlet is 
merely a challenge. They've overcome far worse. Their star has departed for 
another stage, but the show will go on. 
</P>
<P>
 While the situation seems designed for comedy, resident Otto Korner is not 
only an extremely articulate observer but a man with an acute sense of irony. 
The result is a rich and complex novel; a meditation on age, love, loss and the 
enduring guilt felt by those who survived the European catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the war, Korner was a promising poet and literary journalist, happily 
married and the father of a son. Like many others with powerful ties to their 
homeland, he was reluctant to leave, ignoring the pleadings of his wife until 
flight was no longer possible. 
</P>
<P>
 His tragic personal story is revealed only gradually, when long-suppressed 
memories are aroused by a new young physical therapist at the Emma Lazarus 
house, a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to his first, lost love. Each 
encounter with Mandy Dattner opens another locked door into Korner's past, 
reminding him of the dazzling Magda Damrosch and then, inevitably, of the 
family who perished in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 The fragments accumulate and slip into place, putting Korner in the foreground 
of the European artistic ferment between the wars. Introduced by the 
free-spirited Damrosch to the vibrant cafe life of Zurich before the First 
World War, Korner meets the avant-garde writers, artists and political figures 
of the era, encounters that continue to shape his view of the world. He 
treasures only one relic of his past -- a letter from the great German poet 
Rilke praising Korner's youthful efforts in verse. 
</P>
<P>
 The mysterious disappearance and subsequent recovery of that letter will 
thrust Korner still further into the present, making it possible for him to 
relinquish his chosen role of Ghost and take the part of Hamlet. As the reader 
discovers, the parallels between the cynical 83-year-old refugee and the young 
Prince of Denmark are inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the subtext of "The Prince of West End Avenue" is profound, the tone 
is kept buoyant by the interaction among the Emma Lazarus residents, whose 
intrigues, passions and arguments provide a counterpoint of levity. 
</P>
<P>
 You may forget you're reading a serious novel after encountering the lusty and 
sardonic Benno Hamburger and the unregenerate Bolshevik nicknamed "the Red 
Dwarf." After you've attended one of the impromptu philosophical seminars led 
by the relentlessly cerebral Hermione Perlmutter and watched as Tosca 
Dawidowicz transforms herself from a pudgy virago into a superb Ophelia, you'll 
think for a moment that the author has intended only to entertain you with a 
cast of gifted, if inadvertent, comedians. The coffee hours in Goldstein's 
Dairy Restaurant are hilarious; the rivalries and romances among the actors 
continuously diverting. Otto Korner's thoughtful commentary, still cadenced 
with European formality, keeps the humor firmly under control. 
</P>
<P>
 As Korner tells us at the beginning of this supremely original book, his 
subject "is not amateur theatricals, it is art -- or, more accurately, 
anti-art: in brief, dada." An ideal metaphor for the insoluble riddles of the 
20th Century.

'WEENIE ROAST' SIZZLES AT IRVINE MEADOWS; KROQ'S CROSS-GENERATIONAL AGENDA IS 
SHOWCASED AT FESTIVAL IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the idea of KROQ's "Weenie Roast" rock festival at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre on Saturday was to show the cross-generational appeal of the radio 
station's programming, it did a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 The baker's dozen of acts on the all-day bill covered a vast range from old 
faves (the Pretenders, Boingo) to new sensations (Beck, the Offspring) young 
enough to be their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ed McMahon? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there was Mr. Hi-ooooh, Mr. You-May-Have-Already-Won-$10-Million, decked 
out in grunge drag -- from backward cap to baggie shorts to storm-trooper boots 
-- on stage to make a typically affable introduction of the typically intense 
Rollins Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, on a day marked by such incongruities as having Green Day's snotty 
punk antics followed by Counting Crows' somber earnestness, it worked.  
</P>
<P>
 McMahon's brief appearance provided a grandfatherly presence, rounding out a 
family unit of a show in which lead Pretender Chrissie Hynde and head Boingo 
Danny Elfman served as fine parental figures for the generally young crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hynde and Elfman, each making solid comebacks after absences from the 
rock scene of a few years, invested their "Weenie Roast" sets with the wisdom 
of their experience. Playing mostly old hits for this young crowd, the 
tart-tongued Hynde seems to have grown comfortably into the role of a strong, 
independent woman that was thrust upon her when she first made an impact some 
15 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Boingo (the Oingo has been jettisoned, in case you were wondering) 
concentrated on new material, songs that have a sympathetically paternal tone 
that strikes a delicate balance. Even as Elfman in one song mocks the blind 
Angst of the younger generation, he -- without condescension -- makes it clear 
that he has walked in their Doc Martens and has survived the doubts and fears 
of that troubled age without losing his edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, a few of the younger performers could have used a little parental 
guidance, notably orange-haired Green Day singer Billie Joe, who dropped his 
drawers during the band's set. On the other hand, Hynde too (though 
accidentally) lost her skirt early in her set and blithely shrugged and carried 
on -- but of course, she, unlike Billy Joe, was wearing tights underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other young acts also, artistically speaking, dropped their pants. 
Pavement began its short set with a lengthy percussion jam that sounded a 
little like the Who's "Magic Bus" intro, and then climaxed with bursts of 
chaotic noise.  
</P>
<P>
 Beck followed Pavement with his own round of random Moog synthesizer noise and 
feedback from his band. That's the beauty of his rap-folk jewel "Loser" being a 
KROQ mega-hit. An unknown would probably have been booed off the stage for such 
artistic antics, but the 15,000 fans cheered his every oddball move, including 
when he impetuously changed the "Loser" chorus to "I'm a goldfish baby, so why 
don't you feed me." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there was a veteran model for this attitude as well: the 
show-closing Violent Femmes, whose Gordon Gano is the Peter Pan of alternative 
rock. Fortunately, not every young act chooses sarcasm as its emotion of 
choice. In fact, the bill jumped haphazardly around the map, from the intensity 
of opening Candlebox to the winsome, wispy folksiness of new Australian band 
Frente, from the precocious punk command of the Offspring to the premature 
poetics of Counting Crows.  
</P>
<P>
 Most impressive may have been Afghan Whigs, with the controlled intensity of 
singer Greg Dulli balancing the tightly wound quality of Rollins with the rock 
focus of the Pretenders. The English band James, as well, showed a true 
confidence and maturity, mixing folksy shambling with arty posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 What tied it all together, besides the fact that each act has at least one 
KROQ hit, was a spirited, joyful innocence found in even the snottiest and most 
sarcastic stances -- the kind of innocence that matures well. It's not hard to 
imagine some 15 years from now Frente's sweetly shy singer Angie Hart or the 
Offspring's confident front man Dexter Holland standing on this same stage as 
surrogate parental figures for a new generation of KROQers. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope that future show is as well-run as this one. A rotating double 
stage, with one act setting up on the back while another was playing in front, 
kept things moving -- they only fell behind about 15 minutes.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; DOE SHOWS THAT X STILL MARKS THE SPOT FOR PUNK FANS 
</P>

<P>
 As a member of X, John Doe made some of the most affecting music of the early 
'80s, chronicling urban alienation with a rootsy punk sound. Friday night, 
headlining at Our House, he delivered more than an hour's worth of X songs, 
more recent originals and covers, and made it plain that he remains as 
important an artist as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric guitarist Smokey Hormel added texture to Doe's stark acoustic work as 
they played a lean hybrid of folk and country. Doe's roots were evident through 
such folk tunes as "Rank Strangers to Me" that explore the same kinds of themes 
X used to deal with. And though his songs about alienation seemed deeply felt, 
his set was casual and fun as he joked a little with the audience and, at one 
point, encouraged people to sing along. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight was the encore: Doe handed a guitar to his "best friend in the 
world," fellow X alum Exene Cervenka, who was cheered wildly by a crowd too 
young to have seen X in its prime. She and Doe sang a number that had more to 
do with the fun they were having onstage together than with the dark themes 
that forged their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-songwriter Cindy Lee Berryhill is known for writing clever, quirky folk 
songs; recently she has been playing more complex material with her so-called 
"garage orchestra," a group that includes a cello, vibraphone and mandolin. 
Friday night, she sang many of those newer songs using only an electric guitar 
and occasionally a harmonica. It made for an interesting set, somewhat 
reminiscent of Joni Mitchell's work. 
</P>
<P>
 O (Otis Barthoulameu), frontman of the punk band Fluf from San Diego, opened 
the show with a set of simple but melodic songs on acoustic guitar. He lent 
them the same kind of catchy charm he gives Fluf's harder-edged material, and 
the acoustic accompaniment enabled him to showcase a good voice sometimes 
overwhelmed by his band. But he seemed to bring little meaning or purpose to 
the set, and some of it came across as the very kind of lightweight material 
his band's name seems to mock.

 Stern Unplugged: Radio shock jock Howard Stern was unusually quiet for a few 
moments on Friday, but it was because somebody pulled the plug. Stern, whose 
syndicated program is based in New York, was broadcasting live from Cleveland 
when the show was briefly interrupted by a cut cable. Police arrested an 
employee of a rival Cleveland station, WMMS-FM, who allegedly did the cutting. 
Stern was in the city to promote his recent ratings victory on WNCX-FM over 
morning programs on WMMS-FM and WMJI-FM. John Gorman, operations manager at 
WMMS, said the station didn't condone the broadcast interruption. LEGAL FILE

 Stars and Bars: Tom Cruise isn't on trial, just the bartender image he 
captured in the 1988 film "Cocktail." The actor gave a sworn statement last 
week in Los Angeles about how he learned flashy bartender moves from TGI 
Friday's restaurant employees to prepare for his role. "He showed up and 
testified like any other citizen," said Bertram Fields, Cruise's lawyer. Four 
former Friday's waitresses are suing two of the chain's eateries in San Diego, 
claiming one male manager and one female manager harassed female employees. 
Attorney William Ward plans to use Cruise's testimony to show the attitudes in 
"Cocktail" accurately portrayed the restaurant environment. Friday's management

 Storm Over Redgrave: A plan by Vanessa Redgrave, known in the past for her 
anti-Zionist views, to perform in Israel for the first time next month has 
provoked a storm of protest and a bid to have the production at the 
state-subsidized theater in Haifa canceled. A meeting of the theater's 
17-member board has been called for today when the Jewish artistic director, 
Oded Kutler, will defend his decision to invite Redgrave to perform in a 
production of "Brecht in Exile," a collection of works written by the 
playwright Bertolt Brecht, whose son-in-law, Ekkehart Chall, will also take 
part. "I believe that Miss Redgrave changed her mind about performing here 
because of the peace accord with the PLO," Kutler said. QUICK TAKES

JAZZ; VOCALS OUTSHINE THE HEADLINERS AT GREEK THEATRE 
</P>

 Though pianist David Benoit and guitarist Russ Freeman were the headliners 
Friday night at the Greek Theatre, the show was stolen by the purposefully 
stirring vocals of Phil Perry, who guested with Benoit-Freeman, and Diane 
Schuur, who was second on the bill -- following opener Tom Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 On such heavily back-beat vehicles as "After the Love Has Gone," Perry applied 
his pale-as-Budweiser tenor, closing his eyes, wincing, then sliding seamlessly 
from soft, mid-range tones to vibrant notes that were as thin and shiny as 
Freeman's electric guitar strings. 
</P>
<P>
 In her set, Schuur walloped the piano as she lit into "Spirit in the Dark," a 
demoness determined to get through to the crowd. Her enthusiasm, her muscular 
alto and throbbing piano backing all combined to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benoit-Freeman set consisted of easily-digested instrumental pop/jazz 
vehicles. The leaders performed these tunes sure-footedly, and, sporting 
appealing tones, offered improvisations that contained rows of pretty notes 
that lacked aesthetic grit. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, in an R&B mood, romped through "Pick Up the Pieces," "Rock Island 
Rocket" and others, displaying his ability to craft persuasive if derivative 
bluesy solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Each band's rhythm section provided the kind of dynamic whammy that kept the 
sets on track. ZAN STEWART

POP; STIRRING LOBOS DON'T NEED A HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last summer at the Greek Theatre, Los Lobos put on a 20th anniversary show, 
replete with guest stars and sense of occasion. This summer, with neither a 
significant anniversary nor new product to celebrate, it's just another year in 
the long life of just another band from you-know-where, commemorated with just 
another spectacularly good Greek show for another delirious near-capacity 
house.If anything, this premier live band fares even better with no theme to 
its party. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has been restructured for the new annum, no longer commencing with a 
batch of traditional acoustic Mexican material. The Spanish-language tunes came 
fully electric and in small doses, mid-set and at the first encore call. It may 
be the function of playing to a hometown crowd that it was always these that 
immediately galvanized the 6,000 upright. 
</P>
<P>
 In any city less inclined to sing along en Espan ol , the group's expert 
blues-rock excursions and David Hidalgo's guitar fireworks would function as 
fully climactic arena-pleasers. Little improvs kept much of the familiar 
material fresh. As Pete Townshend said: Got a feeling 21 is gonna be a good 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentle-spirited Texas troubadour Jimmie Dale Gilmore opened with an engaging, 
well-received performance, mostly recent material. CHRIS WILLMAN

DANCE; 'TANGO' REVUE AT WILSHIRE PLIES EMOTION OF FATALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Born a century ago in the lower depths of an immigrant subculture, the tango 
still embodies a sense of hopeless desire and estrangement. This fatalism alone 
makes it superbly theatrical -- a quality demonstrated anew in "Forever Tango: 
The Eternal Dance," which opened a five-week run on Friday at the Wilshire 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen in a preliminary version at UCLA four years ago, Luis Bravo's mostly 
Argentine revue envisions the tango as the love-child of the bandoneon (a 
German relative of the accordion) and the Buenos Aires night. The bandoneon is 
male, earthy and mournful. The night is female, alluring and mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forever Tango" insists on the primacy of music in this relationship, with Act 
I, in particular, structured as a tango concert punctuated by brief dances. 
Augmented by strings and keyboards, the bandoneon is definitely master here. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, however, the tango belongs to the night: No matter how fine 
Lisandro Adrover's 11-member, all-male band may be, no matter how generous the 
time allotted to its artistry, the dancing women will not be denied. Billed 
only by their first names, they make each duet a heightened emotional 
experience by confronting their stoic or brooding partners with passionate, 
unpredictable forays into self-realization. 
</P>
<P>
 There's young Norma, who dances with suave Luis Pereyra -- so elegant, so 
unattainable, wearing dresses slit or pulled back to fully expose her showgirl 
legs. A woman of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the spectacularly pliant Ines who dances with volatile Carlos Borquez 
and seems wildly, eternally hungry for his love. A woman of extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sandor and Miriam dance, you see -- as in bravura ballet and ice-skating 
partnerships -- the physical daring of their choreography become a metaphor for 
other kinds of risk in a relationship. And when Carlos and Alicia dance, the 
tango becomes a private language, with the woman rocking gently in her 
partner's arms, drawing from him a tenderness that, in turn, inspires her to 
bolder statements of devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, perhaps: veterans Gloria and Eduardo -- both short, thick, 
weathered and fast on their feet. After a lifetime together, the patrician 
Gloria treats Eduardo not as her partner but her fate: She furiously kicks at 
him, twists and dodges as he tries to manipulate her but ultimately melds with 
him in a deep backbend -- or throws herself onto his hip as if tossing a rose 
from a balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forever Tango" also boasts two capable singers -- Carlos Morel and Sandra 
Cabal -- along with an atmospheric black-on-black bandstand milieu, varied as 
much as possible by lighting designer Ernesto Diz. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lighter, more diluted showcase of Argentine traditions than "Tango 
Argentino" (seen locally in 1986 and '87). But it's got the moves, the mood, 
the sound of tango in its blood, plus the heart-stopping illusion that all five 
couples are pursuing the deepest fantasy of their lives on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Forever Tango: The Eternal Dance" continues through July 17 at the Wilshire 
Theatre, 8440 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. Performances are scheduled on 
Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m., Sundays at 3 and 
7:30 p.m. Tickets: $17-$40. Information: (213) 480-3232.

MUSIC; JERRY HADLEY: A TENOR WITH 2 FACES FOR THE OCCASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the real Jerry Hadley please stand up? 
</P>
<P>
 Two tenors, both personable, appeared under the same name Saturday night amid 
the glitzy neo-Deco splendors of the Alex 
quasi-movie-palace/would-be-concert-hall in Glendale. The first Hadley was a 
bright and brash opera star with a penchant for easy effects. The second turned 
out to be a hard-sell show-biz idol who often sang artfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, paradoxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A large audience -- the sort that breaks into applause when it recognizes the 
introduction to "La donna e mobile" and hums along with Cilea -- loved both 
guys. It also seemed to love Gualtiero Negrini, the dauntlessly idealistic 
resident maestro-cum-impresario who tends to confuse time-beating with 
conducting. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not all, folks. The assembled fans also registered emphatic 
approval for a dutiful if not beautiful student band labeled the Opera 
Orchestra of Los Angeles, and for an amateurish men's chorus that occasionally 
raised its 16 voices in a reasonable facsimile of song. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't a very good night for pursuit of the loftiest lyric muse. But it 
was quite a good night for star-gazing and tune-basking. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadley, fresh from Tom-and-Jerry shows in San Francisco (joint concerts with 
the baritone Thomas Hampson), began the relatively serious half of the program 
with a single flight of esoterica: "Alma soave" from Donizetti's "Maria di 
Rohan." He sounded engaging in the bel-canto challenge, poised and ardent, 
despite an ongoing tendency to push the tone sharp in climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Great Hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor, who frequently reached the last cutoff before the tenor, 
confused "La donna e mobile" with a slow waltz. For his part, the tenor 
disfigured the Verdian structure with odd pauses, most notably an endless break 
just before the ultimate two-note cadence. Still the sound was always pretty, 
the manner always urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly and disappointingly, Hadley mustered more passion than finesse 
for the famous laments from "L'Arlesiana" and "Werther." He spun out the legato 
lines of "Je crois entendre encore" from "Les Pecheurs de Perles" sensitively, 
but valor turned to pallor when he resorted to wide-open falsetto in the 
ultimate climax. Bidding his operatic adieu, he reveled in the bravado of the 
Kleinzach narrative from "Les Contes d'Hoffmann." 
</P>
<P>
 Hadley's gifts are obvious. His top tones gleamed (though some of the bottom 
ones tended to evaporate). His sound was always fresh, his interpretive manner 
always forthright. He phrases cleanly and points the texts knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, given his extraordinary resources and obvious intelligence, one wished 
for more: greater attention to distinctions of style, greater concern for 
dynamic subtlety, a heightened sense of individuality, a touch of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To give his illustrious guest some breathing space, Negrini interspersed a 
rather raucous "Figaro" overture (what's a man like Mozart doing in a place 
like this?) and a literally racy "Carmen" entr'acte. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came the light stuff. Hadley marched bravely through 
"Stouthearted Men" in a key palpably too low for him. He offered a mushy ode to 
Mario Lanza via the Serenade from "The Student Prince" and crooned "What'll I 
Do?" sweetly. He waded elegantly through the slush of "All I Ask of You" from 
"Phantom of the Opera," and found the high-pianissimo ending of "Bring Him 
Home" from "Les Miserables" more congenial than the comparable reflection of 
Bizet's pearl fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 To end the official portion of the program, Hadley belted out "Almost Like 
Being in Love" in a particularly tasteless arrangement (disfigurement?) by 
Michael Starobin. Lerner and Loewe should sue. 
</P>
<P>
 For their contribution to the fun, Negrini and the kids plodded through 
Bernstein's "Candide" overture. 
</P>
<P>
 At encore time, Hadley made a lovely, wistful thing of "Lonely Town" from 
Bernstein's "On The Town," followed by a soggy Neapolitan song and, finally, 
"Funiculi, Funicula." Where are those accordions when we need them? 
</P>
<P>
 The fans bestowed cheers and flowers. Lots of both. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seated downstairs at an orchestra concert a few weeks ago, I found the 
acoustics of the all-purpose Alex disastrously dull and dry. Seated at the 
front of the balcony this time, I found the sound drastically over-resonant, 
the instrumental choirs dominated by bass and brass. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The program booklet could have benefited from the services of a good 
proofreader. In the end, however, the typographical errors didn't matter 
because no one could see the program. A jittery genius at the lighting console 
kept the hall pitch dark. He also kept turning the tenoral spotlight on and 
off, and, whenever sentiment loomed, bathed the stage in lurid red. Very 
classy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negrini's program biography omitted his most salient credit: a long, 
successful run as the Pavarotti look-and-sound-alike in "Phantom." Surely he 
isn't ashamed of his mock-operatic past. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Hadley first burst upon the scene, one enthusiastic critic -- this 
one, actually -- called the young singer a "great tenor hope of the 
post-Pavarotti generation." Now, Hadley is 42, and hope seems to have evolved 
into something else. The critical quote is still in use, however, now 
conveniently altered for a prominent poster. "Jerry Hadley," it claims, "is one 
of the great lyric tenors among the post-Pavarotti generation." The attribution 
is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for literary license. So much for truth in advertising.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; THE SOUNDS AND SIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS AMERICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every Huayucaltia appearance is a learning experience, and Saturday's show at 
Randell's was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the trendy jazz-fusion nightspot might seem an unlikely venue for a 
mostly acoustic quintet that plays the indigenous music of the Americas, 
Huayucaltia won over the assembled with its rhythmic mixture of guitars, 
percussion and wind instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 The group doesn't present faithful re-creations of various styles from South 
and Central America. Instead, it brings them together ( huayucaltia is the 
Aztec word for unity), blending rhythms and instrumentation into a sound that 
mirrors the cultures yet is entirely the band's own. 
</P>
<P>
 "America Negra" is a perfect example. While singer/wind player Cindy Harding 
explained that the tune is a celebration of black culture in the Americas, it 
also involved Peruvian and Mexican rhythms in a strongly percussive mix, 
decorated with the rattling sound of teeth set in a donkey's jaw. Julio 
Ledezman earned a large ovation with a demanding conga-like solo on cajon , a 
large box from which he coaxed a variety of timbres. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening "Cuzco" blended wooden flutes, guitar and percussion into a 
danceable mix in which rhythm and atmosphere varied as the tune climbed to its 
simple theme. "The Message" featured bird calls and rattling percussion by 
Hernan Pinilla before dissolving into a stong drum beat from Ledezma and 
droning guitar sounds from Ciro Hurtado. 
</P>
<P>
 Though exposure to these sounds is an education in itself, learning also came 
as each member of the group took time to explain a song's inspiration, rhythmic 
derivations and the instruments used to play it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledezma gave the most entertaining introduction of the first set, poking fun 
at Columbus ("he took the gold and left us the music") during his remarks 
preceding "Amazonas." During the number itself, Harding's flute played above 
Atonio Ezkauriatza's electric keyboard bass line, giving the music a light, 
airborne feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado is the group's principal soloist, combining agile, flamenco-inspired 
lines with other classical influences and occasional blue or jazz phrases. He 
was most impressive during "America Negra," flying to his guitar's highest 
pitch as he closed his improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 Huayucaltia also is a visual delight, as percussionists move between 
instruments and pan pipes are pushed back and forth as the players strike tones 
and gasp for breath. And it's almost guaranteed that you'll see at least one 
instrument (like that donkey's jaw) that you've never seen before.

MUSIC REVIEW; POLITE RITES CLOSE LONG BEACH SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 JoAnn Falletta tamed the Stravinsky monster when closing her fifth season as 
music director of the Long Beach Symphony on Saturday at the Terrace Theater. 
The trouble is a civilized "Sacre du Printemps" is undoubtedly a contradiction 
in terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program that also included works by William Schuman and Gershwin, 
Falletta led a polished and problematic account of Stravinsky's ballet score. 
</P>
<P>
 She managed to smooth out the colliding, abrupt changes in rhythms, dampen the 
pulsating energy, minimize the creepy, eerie elements and offer a smooth, 
well-regulated account of the music. "Sacre" somehow began to sound more like 
late-Romantic Strauss than epochal Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the score was a new addition to the Long Beach Symphony repertory, 
the orchestra played it with certainty, well-rounded attack, sheen, even with a 
certain opulence in color. 
</P>
<P>
 Something is definitely wrong, however, when there is more visceral excitement 
in the playing of William Schuman's "New England Triptych," which opened the 
program, than in "Sacre." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Falletta oversaw a bright, transparent and disciplined reading of the 
American composer's bracing music. In addition to the sweep and energy she 
emphasized in the outer movements, she created a delicate background for the 
sensitive solos by oboist Larry Timm and bassoonist Julie Feves in the "When 
Jesus Wept" section. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The center portion of the concert was a conflicted account of Gershwin's Piano 
Concerto in F, with Lorin Hollander as soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a spokesperson for the orchestra, Hollander has been dealing with 
some medical problems, which may or may not account for the musical problems 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist offered heavily percussive playing, unsubtle in color, limited in 
dynamic, cool in approach and prone to sluggish tempos. The notes were there, 
but without much wit or verve. 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta seemed boxed in by his approach, particularly in trying to hold 
together the fragile second movement and to let loose whenever an opportunity 
arose to let a tune bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, she paid Gershwin due honor in treating his music with 
affection and respect and without exaggerating and cheapening the jazz-inspired 
idiom. Trumpeter Andy Ulyate proved a steady and stylish blues soloist.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SUPERCHUNK FLEXES PUNK-POWER MUSCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Carolina's Superchunk is the gleaming front piece on the hood of Chapel 
Hill's thriving underground rock scene. The quartet, which plays raw power pop 
with a cuddly yet jagged edge, started its own label in the late '80s, and has 
since turned down offers from several major labels. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a move that has upped its status to indie rock god. The group has put out 
close to 25 Superchunk releases on its label Merge (as well as a slew of other 
local bands from the college town), and attracted a substantial audience 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday at the Palace, the T-shirt-clad band came out jumping and moving to its 
high-energy tunes, which sounded somewhere between the sweetness of the Monkees 
and the sneering snottiness of the Sex Pistols. Nothing mindbending, but it 
beats most bands in the power-punk department. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist Mac McCaughan shouted the highs, then croaked the lows as if 
he were at home in the shower. Bassist Laura Ballence interjected gruff backup 
vocals and, in between, bounced up and down like a Superball. The audience, 
which had plenty of space to move around, pogoed in packs rather than slamming 
in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Superchunk played tight numbers with catchy hooks hidden under the grumbling 
distortion. Toward the end of the hour-plus set, the band's energy began to 
drain, especially during slower numbers, but came back in one big blast for the 
encore. LORRAINE ALI

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; COMBUSTIBLE EDISON CAPTURES '50S COOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New England lounge revivalists Combustible Edison's performance Saturday night 
at Fuzzyland offered a generous set of expertly rendered, affectionately 
updated cocktail music. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's debut album, "I, Swinger," perfectly duplicates the '50s cool and 
hi-fi exotica of such lounge icons as Martin Denny.But as a live act there's 
nothing dusty about Combustible's sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Tightly arranged original tunes like "Impact!" and "Satan Says" were executed 
with engaging gusto. Even an elevator classic such as "Summer Samba" was 
reconstructed into a minor masterpiece of Space Age swing. 
</P>
<P>
 The versatile quintet often managed to sound like a much larger outfit, 
employing splashes of vibraphone, glockenspiel and a wide range of percussion 
to color their compositions. Drummer-vocalist Lily Banquette delivered 
affecting, tiki-torch readings of "Surabaya Johnny" and "Cry Me a River."  
</P>
<P>
 Combustible Edison approaches its material with wit, but it never stoops to 
spoof or parody. Performing in matching ruffle shirts and sparkling vests -- 
Banquette sported a pale green party dress -- the group clearly reveled in 
bringing its retro-cocktail sounds to life. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

'CAROUSEL' WINS TONY AWARD FOR BEST REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Carousel" and "An Inspector Calls," two productions from Britain's Royal 
National Theater, were chosen Sunday as best musical and play revivals at a 
1994 Tony Awards that honored a Broadway season dominated by old shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Wright won for best featured actor in a play for his performance in 
the second part of Tony Kushner's epic play about AIDS, "Angels in America: 
Perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the big battle was between "Beauty and the Beast" and "Passion," two very 
different love stories that competed for the top musical prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast," a lavish stage version of the Walt Disney animated 
movie, was the season's most popular new show. Filled with eye-popping special 
effects, the fairy-tale romance brought the world's best-known film company -- 
and its expert marketing -- to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion" is the work of the coolly cerebral Stephen Sondheim, Broadway's most 
celebrated composer, and author-director James Lapine. It tells an adult story 
of obsessive love, the desire by a plain, unhappy woman for a handsome military 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even in the running were the other two Best Musical nominees: "A Grand 
Night for Singing," a revue of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, and "Cyrano," a 
Dutch musical about the long-nosed swordsman. Both shows already have closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition between "Passion" and "Beauty and the Beast" for Best Musical 
overshadowed the other awards, even the contest for Best Play, where 
"Perestroika," the second half of Tony Kushner's epic AIDS drama "Angels in 
America" was the favorite. "Millennium Approaches," the play's first part, took 
the prize last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing against Kushner's play were "Broken Glass," Arthur Miller's look at 
an unraveling marriage; "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," Anna Deavere Smith's 
examination of the California riots, and the already-closed "Kentucky Cycle," 
Robert Schenkkan's seven-hour marathon about 200 years of greed and treachery 
in the Bluegrass State. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Smith, producer of the Tony Awards telecast, proclaimed the theme of the 
show as "Past, Present and Future," but it was the past that prevailed over the 
last 12 months. Seventeen old shows -- 10 plays and seven musicals -- opened on 
Broadway during the season that ended May 31, compared with 20 new shows and 
special attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't hurt the box office. Buoyed by such crowd-pleasers as "Carousel," 
"Abe Lincoln in Illinois," "Damn Yankees," "Medea," "Grease" and "She Loves 
Me," Broadway attracted more than 8.1 million theatergoers during the season, 
the highest attendance level in five years. Grosses climbed to $356 million, up 
from $327 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Tandy, Broadway's original Blanche DuBois in "A Streetcar Named 
Desire," and Hume Cronyn, Tandy's actor husband, were the first recipients of a 
special Tony Award for lifetime achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The award for regional theater, based on a recommendation of the American 
Theater Critics Assn., was given to the McCarter Theater of Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tony Awards are presented by the League of American Theaters and Producers 
and the American Theater Wing, which founded the prizes in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners were chosen by 687 theater professionals and journalists who voted 
by secret ballot.

 BUT THEY CAN CHEW GUM: It was billed as a "soccer relay," a PR event designed 
to lure soccer fans to Glendale during the World Cup. But by the time it was 
over, a large chunk of the city's political leadership had been wounded in 
action. More than 200 participants took turns booting a soccer ball along 
various streets. While most got a nice little workout, the mayor and two 
council members fell down; one got a black eye in the bargain. (B2) 
</P>
<P>
 LIBRARY FIX-UP: Among the many Los Angeles institutions damaged by the Jan. 17 
quake was the city's library system. Ten branches -- all but one in the Valley 
-- are still closed. And officials say light fixtures and bookshelves in 27 
others don't meet new seismic codes or recommended safety standards. But 
officials insist bookworms are in no imminent danger. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 ROWDY ROAD: By day, the six unpaved miles of Mulholland Drive above the Valley 
are a scenic byway for joggers and hikers. But after dark, it becomes a haunt 
for carousing teens, thieves, even killers. . . . City officials have an idea. 
They want to put up gates to keep out vehicles at night and during fire season. 
Above, ranger Kenn Hughes on patrol. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 MOTHER KILLED: It was a case of murder by mistake. Rene Hurtado had gotten 
back into her car after getting change at a North Hills store when a suspected 
gang member started shooting at his rivals. A bullet slammed through Hurtado's 
windshield, killing her and barely missing her daughter. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY TALKS: You might wonder if Republican congressional candidate Richard 
Sybert got his money's worth last Tuesday. After all, he spent about $300,000, 
and got only 18,089 votes -- more than $1.60 per vote. . . . But he did win the 
primary and a November showdown with Democrat Anthony Beilenson is next. "I won 
strongly, and it makes me a more credible candidate for the fall," Sybert said.

REBELS REJECT PEACE PLAN IN MEXICO

<P>
 Dozens of rebel Indian communities in southern Mexico overwhelmingly rejected 
a government peace proposal but voted against renewed violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista National Liberation Army, which launched the New Year's Day 
uprising, issued the results in a communique late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It said 98% of villagers in the area it controls, in remote southeastern 
Chiapas state, voted against accepting the government offer, which promised 
more government aid to the impoverished region and reforms of the state's 
repressive political system. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the announcement said the villagers, mostly descendants of Mayan 
Indians, voted for "a new national dialogue with all the nation's progressive 
forces for democracy, liberty and justice for all Mexicans."

NAACP OPENS 3-DAY SUMMIT; DIRECTOR CALLS FOR UNIFIED STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. challenged black leaders 
Sunday to develop a unified strategy to improve the lives of the nation's 35 
million African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis urged them to "take the next step on freedom road."He spoke at a 2 
1/2-hour televised round-table discussion that opened the group's three-day 
summit. Strategy will be formulated behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 About 65 leaders in business, education, civil rights and religion 
participated, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's presence was criticized by Jewish leaders, but he said the 
summit's diversity should be a challenge, not an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who disagree vehemently with one another will help to shape each 
other's ideas, philosophies and agendas," Farrakhan said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a block away from the summit, members of national Jewish groups 
protested. Farrakhan passed them in a caravan of dark cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no problems, but security was tight at NAACP headquarters, 
where private security guards and police stood watch along with bow-tied 
members of the Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 NAACP leaders dismissed criticism of Farrakhan's participation, saying that no 
ethnic or religious group has a right to tell another group how to conduct its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not let external controversy from letting us meet with one 
another," Chavis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, sponsored by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People, is aimed at finding ways to create jobs and improve conditions for 
African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue that could be discussed is an economic boycott of South Carolina, 
whose Legislature has refused to lower the Confederate battle flag atop the 
Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The round-table discussion was followed by a reception. A public meeting was 
held Sunday evening at a Baltimore church.

G. WILLIAM MARSHALL; ACTOR, PRODUCER, DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 G. William Marshall, an American actor and producer whose marriages to film 
stars probably made him better known than his dramatic career, has died, it was 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, whose four wives included Ginger Rogers and Michele Morgan, died 
Wednesday, according to a legal notice placed by his family in the Parisian 
newspaper Le Figaro.The place and cause of death were not announced. He was 
believed to be 76. Other information was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was placed by Mike Marshall, his son by Morgan, his first 
wife, and Tonie Marshall, his daughter by his second wife, actress Micheline 
Presle. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime vocalist with the Fred Waring orchestra was also married to Rogers 
and actress Corinne Aboyneau and was a friend of Clark Gable, Errol Flynn and 
Marilyn Monroe. He became Rogers' fifth husband in 1961 in a North Hollywood 
church ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 He recounted his professional and marital life in his 1983 memoirs, "The Sixth 
Season." Morgan took him to court to have intimate passages about their life 
together removed from the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Chicago, Marshall started his career with Waring in 1936. The next 
year, Marshall was leading his own band, and he began making film appearances 
in 1940 with "Flowing Gold" and "Santa Fe Trail." 
</P>
<P>
 His credits are often confused with those of another actor of the same name, 
who has appeared in films since the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's other acting credits include "Belle of the Yukon" in 1944; "State 
Fair" in 1945; "Murder in the Music Hall," "Earl Carroll Sketchbook" and "That 
Brennan Girl," all in 1946, and "Calendar Girl" and "Blackmail" in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall directed and produced "Adventures of Captain Fabian" in 1951, and he 
directed "The Phantom Planet" in 1961.

CASSELL'S SCORING SURGE LEADS ROCKETS TO VICTORY; GAME 3: ROOKIE GUARD SCORES 
FINAL SEVEN POINTS AS HOUSTON DEFEATS NEW YORK, 93-89, TO TAKE 2-1 LEAD IN 
SERIES.

<P>
 The Houston Rockets avoided another fourth-quarter fade Sunday night and 
guaranteed that if the Knicks come back to win the NBA championship they'll 
have to do it away from the raucous New York crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie guard Sam Cassell scored the Rockets' last seven points of the game as 
they hung on for a 93-89 victory and a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 His three-pointer with 32 seconds left gave the Rockets the lead for good at 
89-88 and he added four free throws as Houston regained the homecourt advantage 
it had lost in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
 In that game in Houston, they went without a field goal over the last 6 1/2 
minutes. They nearly lost the opener when they let a 12-point lead drop to 
three with 2:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
 They nearly blew Sunday's game but Cassell, who failed in the fourth quarter 
of Game 2, was the unlikely hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still young, I've been learning things all season and my teammates still 
have a lot of confidence in me," Cassell said. "That home court advantage is 
ours, baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks had taken an 88-86 lead, only their third of the game, on Derek 
Harper's jumper with 52 seconds left. Houston got the ball to Hakeem Olajuwon 
who threw it back out to Cassell for the deciding 3-pointer, Houston's second 
in its last 10 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing was called for an offensive foul when he bumped Vernon Maxwell 
on New York's next possession. Cassell made two free throws for a 91-88 lead 
with 22 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks, who had made three of four 3-pointers in New York's Game 2 
victory, missed a three-pointer with 10 seconds left, and was fouled attempting 
another with 3.9 seconds left.

ANN CONWAY: TREND FOR THE '90S IS PARTIES WITH ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parties-on-the-move are the thing for the '90s, says Scott Maxwell, new 
president of the Orange County chapter of the National Assn. of Catering 
Executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, the party emphasis was on staid elegance enjoyed in a pricey 
ballroom setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the economic downturn, the social set began to balk at party price 
tags of more than $100 per person and caterers had to scramble to provide 
low-cost locales. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the great parties are about guests "moving from one party area to another 
in a great locale" says Maxwell, director of special events for Marriott's 
Catering by Design. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amtrak station in Santa Ana is a good example. "It's great to have people 
come to a party there by train," Maxwell says. "They board the train at a 
faraway spot and are whisked to the station for fun in a setting that suits the 
party theme." 
</P>
<P>
 Another hot spot: Rancho Los Lomas, a banquet facility in Santiago Canyon. 
Maxwell and his Catering by Design crew will soon stage a splash there that 
begins with a road rally and ends with a cookout. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests will be invited to drive sports cars through the canyon to the main 
event. Since the party is for Clinique, many of its participants will be from 
out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Catering by Design will take them to their destination and then hand them 
their car keys. "The car trip really sets a mood," Maxwell says. "The Rancho is 
semi-private, very romantic. And urban-rustic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, urban-rustic. Another party buzzword for the '90s. A setting or cuisine 
that is urban-rustic is one that's "cosmopolitan and a little country," Maxwell 
explains. "It means we haven't gone entirely country, but we're headed in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 (Think of a small serving of garlic mashed potatoes presented on a fine plate 
and you'll get the idea, he says.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you're planning a summer bash, consider using lots of color, Maxwell 
advises. "Black and white are out -- too formal, too structured. Magenta, 
purple, gold -- they're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Also out: balloons (using columns, swag colorful fabrics across your ceiling 
or outdoor space); ice sculptures (fresh posies are preferred); no-host bars; 
drink tickets; celebrity look-alikes; Hollywood themes; magicians and mimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In: dancing between food courses; jazz; alternative beverage products such as 
nonalcoholic beer (and a 50-50 blend of orange and cranberry juices); optional 
valet parking ("people like to walk to and from their cars now," Maxwell 
notes); and parties at outdoor sites, especially Pelican Hill Golf Course in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love open air, the ability to gain a sense of the environment," 
Maxwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit premiere: If cows could talk, "Norman" might have had this to say 
about the bash preceding the local premiere of "City Slickers II" in Santa Ana 
last week: " Not too slick ." 
</P>
<P>
 The shy Jersey -- dolled up in black tie and dickey -- was on hand to greet 
the 450 guests who paid $100 each to attend the first benefit for the Probation 
Community Action Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The event had promise. Arriving at Roxbury South for the cocktail and dinner 
portion of the gala, guests were met by an upbeat Western band and twirling 
line dancers. Cowboys atop sleek horses roamed the street. A red carpet was 
rolled out. Bleachers were set up for fans. This was going to be hot! (And this 
was a party on the move. After dinner, guests would walk to Edwards Cinema in 
Hutton Centre for the flick.) 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't deliver. Once inside the multilevel nightclub, guests -- resplendent 
in the prescribed black-tie attire -- got hung up in one bottleneck after 
another. (You can't throw hundreds of guests into a building without any 
direction. Where was the food? The drink? Hidden in out-of-the-way rooms. The 
one obvious bar was closed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Movie premiere, Orange County-style? Let's hope not. Once guests found the 
buffet tables, they were in for a long wait. Hundreds stood in line to watch 
the stuffed chicken run out, again and again. Hungry men began having 
conversations with their watches. Gussied-up women ached for a place to park 
their sequins. 
</P>
<P>
 Television star Lorenzo Lamas ("Renegade") tactfully summed up the scene: 
"It's different," he said. "But the cause is wonderful. And that's why I'm 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 No one could fault the cause. Founded last October, the Probation Community 
Action Assn. aims at reducing crime by providing positive projects for youths 
who are on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Michael Schumacher, chief probation officer for Orange County: "A study 
of 6,400 offenders revealed that 71 % are arrested once and we never see them 
again. Another 21% are arrested twice and that's the end of their criminal 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "But about 8% who are arrested become chronic offenders into adulthood. Those 
are the ones we want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 The association plans to organize a family resource center and provide 
programs to help youths develop the self respect they need to pursue healthy 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 1% of the youth in Orange County cause about 55% of the crime," said 
James Watson, chairman of the PCAA executive committee. "(By our efforts) we 
hope to make a significant difference in the (reduction of the) crime rate and, 
at the same time, turn some lives around."

STREET SMART: CALTRANS SAYS CAR-POOL LANE PROJECTS TO START AROUND END OF '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us in Orange County travel to Los Angeles County on a regular basis. 
Recently, Caltrans has opened on the San Diego (405) Freeway in Long Beach a 
small addition to the car-pool lane system (about from Bellflower Boulevard to 
the Orange County line). 
</P>
<P>
 I think we'd like to know what the plans are for the opening of car-pool lanes 
on the San Diego Freeway in both the north and south directions, from the 
Orange County line to the Harbor (110)Freeway. Recently, car-pool lanes were 
opened on the San Diego Freeway from the Harbor Freeway to the new Glenn M. 
Anderson (105) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you give us an indication of the car-pool lane implementation plans on the 
San Diego Freeway from Orange County through Long Beach and to the Harbor 
Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 William Salmi 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has car-pool lane projects currently in design for two stretches of 
the San Diego Freeway, said Pat Reid, a Caltrans spokeswoman in Los Angeles. 
These stretches are from the Orange County line to the Long Beach (710) Freeway 
and from the Long Beach Freeway to the Harbor Freeway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these car-pool lane projects are fully funded for construction, Reid 
said. It is expected that construction on these projects will begin around the 
end of 1995 and be completed in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have long been confused by the conflict between the signs for northbound 
Ross Street approaching 17th Street and the traffic signals. The signs 
designate the two northbound lanes as turn lanes "ONLY," left and right 
respectively; however, at the intersection there is a controlled left-turn 
light and a plain green light displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The plain green light leads some drivers in the right lane to proceed north 
across 17th, an action that leads to citation by the Santa Ana police. It seems 
that the plain green light should be replaced by a controlled right-turn light 
similar to the prohibited crossing of 17th Street at northbound Flower Street a 
few blocks west of Ross Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan J. Nestlinger 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Santa Ana begs to differ. City traffic engineer T.C. Sutaria says 
there are adequate signs instructing motorists to turn left or right and the 
traffic signals should not cause a conflict.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the two roadside signs that instruct motorists to turn left or right, 
there are turn arrows painted on each lane of the roadway, Sutaria said. The 
overhead traffic signal is a plain green ball and not a turn arrow because it 
is guiding the pedestrians on northbound 17th Street who are allowed to cross 
on the east side of that intersection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Boulevard runs east and west through La Habra and is called 
California 72. The highway also turns south on Harbor Boulevard and continues 
south into Fullerton and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 On Whittier Boulevard just half a block west of Harbor Boulevard on the north 
side of the street is a state highway sign that reads "south" and just below it 
is a state highway sign that reads "39." This sign is not on California 39, it 
is on California 72, and the driver who reads this sign is actually traveling 
west, not south. 
</P>
<P>
 California 39 runs north and south through La Habra. It enters La Habra from 
the north on Hacienda Boulevard, then makes a long turn to the right (west) on 
Whittier and then turns left (south) onto Beach Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 This sign that I have mentioned is actually one and eight-tenths of a mile 
east of the intersection of Hacienda and Whittier. This sign is very misleading 
and should be removed.

 According to the Caltrans State Highway Routes manual, California 72 begins at 
the junction of California 39 westbound to Downey Road near the Los Angeles 
City border. As you mentioned, California 72 is known locally as Whittier 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, legislation was passed describing California 39's jurisdiction as 
being "from California 1 near Huntington Beach to California 72 in La Habra via 
Beach Boulevard." The portion of Whittier Boulevard eastbound to Harbor 
Boulevard (formerly California 72) in La Habra was adopted as part of 
California 39 in legislation that was passed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the sign reading "Highway 39, south" is correct even though it is 
still referred to as Whittier Boulevard, said Rose Orem, a Caltrans 
spokeswoman.

GEORGE RAMOS: 1 LAST OBSTACLE ON THE LONG ROAD TOWARD THE DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nurtured by our families, some of us dream big, pushing to accomplish things 
our parents couldn't achieve. We want to be the best, the brightest -- be it 
President of the United States or the best teacher ever. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it's in that vein that Democratic state Sen. Art Torres and I have this 
little running gag. Whenever I see him these days, I address him as "Gov. 
Torres." That sends him into a fit of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He, in turn, calls me "publisher," though I'm never quite sure what newspaper 
he imagines me in charge of. 
</P>
<P>
 After last Tuesday's election, Torres is a lot closer to the dream than I am. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On election night, I went to Torres' suite at the Biltmore Hotel, which served 
as Results Central for the Democrats, to see how things would turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, a fixture on the local political landscape for more than 20 years as a 
Sacramento lawmaker, was trying to get the Democratic nomination for the state 
insurance commissioner's post. A win would mean he stands a decent chance of 
becoming the first Latino to hold statewide office in almost 120 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a goal many Latinos from the Eastside have dared to try but failed to 
win. Just ask retired Eastside Rep. Edward Roybal, who came the closest. He 
still gets angry talking about that ill-fated race for lieutenant governor in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
 If Torres loses the insurance commissioner race against San Jose Assemblyman 
Charles Quackenbush, it might be the end of the line. He is forced to leave the 
Senate this year because of term limits and it conceivably could be difficult 
to whip up enthusiasm for yet another campaign. After all, this loss would 
follow the 1991 defeat he was dealt by Gloria Molina for a seat on the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But his supporters in Suite 708 at the Biltmore were not thinking about 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them were the candidate's parents -- Arturo and Julia Torres. They 
arrived shortly after the polls closed at 8 p.m. and deposited themselves on a 
couch. They beamed at each person who came by to greet them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to win," said Torres' father, a retired butcher. His mother, who 
stayed home to raise three kids, kept smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' sister, Marina, a bilingual elementary school teacher in Northern 
California, was more to the point. "We've been waiting 20 years for this," she 
said. "It's time. We Chicanos deserve one of our own to hold high office in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 A cousin of Torres, Ernie Alaya, has always been in his corner but couldn't 
lend a hand at times. When Torres ousted longtime Eastside lawmaker Alex P. 
Garcia from the Senate in '82, Alaya was a news reporter and decided he 
couldn't be part of the campaign. He looked frustrated that he had to sit out 
this campaign too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an insurance agent and Art won't take any help from us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Torres wasn't talking with supporters, he retreated to a back bedroom to 
think about the election and to nurture other dreams. A divorced father of two, 
he called his son Joaquin, a freshman at Stanford who couldn't come home for 
the election because of his studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got an A on your final? Alright!" Torres shouted into the phone. "I'm 
very proud of you, mijo. " 
</P>
<P>
 Torres held an early lead after the polls closed at 8 o'clock. It remained 
steady at about 13% over his closest competitor, Westside Assemblyman Burt 
Margolin, but Torres refused to say he had the election locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter Danielle, 12, told her father to get real. "You're ahead now," the 
seventh-grader said, "and you'll be ahead later." 
</P>
<P>
 She was right. About 10:30, a grinning Torres walked over to me and asked, "Do 
you know who Romualdo Pacheco is?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the last Latino to hold statewide office in California. He was 
lieutenant governor in 1871 and later became governor. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have to say anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dreamers know the fall campaign will be very difficult for Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 Detractors will surely seize upon Torres' two drunk-driving convictions 
despite his acknowledgment of these problems. They'll also brand him as a 
bleeding-heart advocate for immigrants, especially since the "Save Our State" 
initiative -- which would refuse many services to illegal immigrants and their 
children -- is on the November ballot. Some will not support him simply because 
he's a Chicano or from the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the uncertainty of how his campaign will mesh with that of 
Kathleen Brown, the Democrats' nominee for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in Suite 708 know all about obstacles. They've lived with them all 
their lives. The fall campaign is just another one to overcome.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GRIPE; NON-VOTERS 
SHOULD 'SHUT UP'

 I voted last Tuesday -- did you? If you are like two-thirds of registered 
voters in California, you did not. You were probably too busy or too 
disinterested. You'll complain, of course, when your taxes are raised, your 
home is robbed, your auto insurance rates go up, campgrounds are closed over 
the Fourth of July or you are denied health coverage because of a pre-existing 
condition. But politicians are all crooks anyway and your one voice just 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you watch the D-day commemoration? Among the participants were Lech Walesa 
and Vaclav Havel. In 1980, Walesa was an electrician at the Gdansk shipyard in 
communist Poland. He is now the leader of free Poland. His one voice, screaming 
for freedom, changed the course of one nation and greatly contributed to the 
demise of communism in Eastern Europe. Havel expressed his disenchantment with 
communism through his plays. He, like Walesa, paid a price for his speech -- 
imprisonment. Yet, he now leads a free Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you hear about the inauguration of Nelson Mandela last month? Mandela 
spent more than 25 years in jail for expressing the view that blacks should be 
extended the franchise in South Africa. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, 
of South Africans lost their lives struggling for the right to vote. American 
Amy Biehl, a Newport Beach native, was also among those who gave their lives 
for the all-race elections. South Africans waited in line for hours to vote in 
April's first multiracial election. Turnout was about 90% of registered South 
Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 You, I know, had pressing business that kept you from voting. Perhaps your 
situation was similar to the young man interviewed last Tuesday in Santa 
Monica. He didn't vote because he had to work and then had to work out and 
finally had to sit on a bench at the 3rd Street Promenade and answer questions 
from a pesky reporter about his civic duties.  
</P>
<P>
 I am not necessarily surprised that this Bozo by the Bay is disenchanted with 
the electoral process. The main "issues" in the primary were which candidate: 
(1) would personally fry more convicted murders; (2) had a personal fortune 
large enough to buy a Senate seat, the governor's mansion or the controller's 
office; (3) more strongly supported at a hot button issue totally unrelated to 
the duties of the office sought; (4) was a talented enough brick mason to build 
an impenetrable barrier across our border, and (5) could buy a slot on the most 
slate mailers. One needs a Ph.D. in political science to comprehend matters 
this technical. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose fault is it that the candidates are less than appealing and the campaign 
issues are less than relevant? As some sage philosopher opined: "People get the 
government they deserve." You, my non-voting friends, deserve what you get. 
Either vote or shut up.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When parents sent their teen-agers off to a party a generation ago, they 
worried about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Today's parents have graver 
concerns. Sending a child to a high school party these days can be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, that's what happened June 5 in posh San Marino when gang members toting 
semiautomatic weapons crashed a party, shooting and killing two teen-agers 
while wounding seven other people. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Youth Opinion, high school students -- some from San Marino -- talk 
about flyer parties and the loss of innocence from killings that happen in 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 When a tragedy such as the San Marino killings occurs, the questions that 
follow are inevitable: Who is to blame? How could this happen? How can we 
prevent this from ever happening again? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the blame apparently goes to flyers, printed invitations to the party. 
Flyer parties are nothing new. Someone decides to throw a party, presumably to 
earn some money, so they distribute flyers to a few hundred of their closest 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is a few dollars, sometimes there is a charge for drinks. There is 
usually little or no control over who walks through the front door. So, if 
armed and angry gang members show up, as they sometimes do, the flyer party 
becomes a Molotov cocktail ready to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 In the strictest sense, San Marino officials say, the June 5 party was not a 
flyer party. The youngster giving the end-of-the-school-year bash apparently 
distributed only a limited number of flyers to his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't really the flyers that brought the problem on," San Marino Mayor 
Bernard Le Sage says. "The problem was that the flyers got into the wrong 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the problem with flyer parties, says Jodi Stout-Ward, whose son, Ty 
Stout, was killed Dec. 8, 1990, at a flyer party in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would advise any parent whose child wants to attend a flyer party to 
investigate immediately," Stout-Ward says. "Kids have these parties to make 
money. They actually hope the police will break them up before the party is 
over so they'll have collected the admission fee, but they'll still be left 
with all the liquor." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a total lack of control and there's no accountability, Stout-Ward 
adds. "When we went to parties, we knew the people who were there. There is a 
certain accountability in friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 What bothers many people is the apparent lack of accountability -- not only on 
the part of the youngsters throwing such parties -- but by the adults who allow 
these parties to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a real sense that many young people are not supervised very well by any 
parental leadership," says Stanley Moore, a political science professor at 
Pepperdine University who notes that more than 55% of California's children are 
raised in single-parent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of these young people, they don't have a great deal of hope," Moore 
says. "They are looking for constant entertainment. These parties play some 
role in meeting those kinds of needs."

 Anticipation of interest in this summer's World Cup soccer championship games 
inspires many businesses to create promotional tie-ins. One fast-food chain 
produces a bag for take-out food that shows flags of the 24 competing 
nations.However, government representatives from one of these countries object 
when they discover their country's flag on the bag. Their ambassador contacts 
corporate headquarters and demands that the flag be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The offended country was Saudi Arabia, whose green flag with a sword contains 
words in Arabic taken from their sacred book, the Koran. The inscription reads, 
"There is no God but God. Mohammed is the messenger of God." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Saudis, the idea that the food bags containing these holy words would 
end up crumbled then thrown into the trash was sacreligious. To jettison sacred 
words in such a casual way would insult not only the Saudis, but Muslims 
everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Saudi officials, the only acceptable way to dispose of anything 
containing quotations from the Koran is to recycle or shred them. Holy words 
must never be thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 A comparable code applies to the disposal of Hebrew sacred words. Worn-out 
holy books, phylacteries, prayer shawls and mezuzot (small containers holding 
prayer portions) must be handled with respect. All these remnants contain God's 
name and cannot be merely discarded. Instead, they are treated almost as human 
beings and buried in a Jewish cemetery in a ceremony called shemot , which 
means "names." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Casual treatment of words to one person may be blasphemy to another.

 On June 5, two San Marino students were killed at a graduation party, stunning 
this wealthy enclave. The killings come on the heels of two slayings near 
Pasadena's Blair High, where a current and former student were shot to death 
May 23. Here's what a few students from both schools had to say about the 
killings and about flyer parties. JUSTIN LOWE 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, San Marino High 
</P>
<P>
 I was at home and my sister told me there had been shootings and some people 
were dead. I didn't believe her at the time because this is something that 
really doesn't happen around here. Later that afternoon as I was watching the 
news, I realized this really did happen. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt that something like this was probably going to happen, not necessarily 
meaning that gang tensions had been building up in San Marino, because we 
really don't have any of that element here. What I did feel coming was a sort 
of a wake-up call -- meaning San Marino has been isolated. It seems we are a 
part of the world and some of the problems of the world are also our problems. 
We can't continue to ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard from other schools how they go around and put flyers on cars and 
throw them all over the place. I hear those parties are kind of rowdy. I've 
seen very few flyers at our school. I don't think this was a flyer party. Those 
so-called flyers were more along the lines of invitations. Instead of buying 
cards or writing to individual people, they copied a poster and handed them out 
to select people. I suppose other people got ahold of these and figured it was 
a flyer party. CHRISTOPHER LONG 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Blair High School, Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
 It happened right after we had two students here shot. It's really sad. But 
it's more of a disappointment than anger because people are so stupid. It just 
makes me feel bad that this is the point where we've come, where people get 
ticked off at a party and come back and want to shoot people. It doesn't 
reflect on the city; it reflects on the people. We have the flyers all the 
time. I've never been to one but I hear about them and most of the time I've 
not heard good things. KEVIN CHAMBERLAIN 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, San Marino High 
</P>
<P>
 When I first heard it, I was in shock. Something like this never goes on in 
San Marino. You don't hear anything about burglaries, let alone murders -- 
especially at high school parties. I've been going to parties since I was a 
freshman and I've never heard even rumors about guns being at them.  
</P>
<P>
 The parents of San Marino aren't going to stand for this violence. It's going 
to be a real crackdown because this is an affluent community and stuff like 
this doesn't go on.  
</P>
<P>
 Flyer parties are usually pretty big. From what I heard this party wasn't. 
There have been some in San Marino but not recently. I think probably because 
of the crowds flyer parties get out of hand. There are so many people and only 
so much space and not enough parking space out front that it usually ends up 
getting broken up by the police because the neighbors get disturbed. STEPHANIE 
NORBERG 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, San Marino High 
</P>
<P>
 It was really scary at first, of course, that it happened right here, so close 
to home and everything. But it was people from other schools and I think that 
was a big part of it. Maybe it's kind of a naive approach but I honestly think 
that with the people I hang around with, that kind of thing is not very likely 
to happen. So it didn't hit home as much with me as it may have with other 
people at my school. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it may have opened people's eyes to the fact that things can happen 
anywhere. But I don't think that this is going to be a recurring problem in San 
Marino. ANTOINE NIBLETT 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Blair High 
</P>
<P>
 It shocked me because I never thought that in San Marino there'd be (anything) 
like that. On the other hand, I'm kind of used to it because I live in a kind 
of bad environment and they shoot every day anyway, so I'm not really 
surprised.  
</P>
<P>
 It did (affect my opinion of San Marino). I just thought it was a nice, 
respectable neighborhood where nothing happens. But now I know you've got to be 
careful. If I ever go there again I'll watch my back. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of flyer parties out here. They're mostly house parties and 
we go and they're fun. JENNIFER YUAN 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, San Marino High School 
</P>
<P>
 I'm shocked because the shooting occurred near my house. I was sad someone 
that young would die. It makes you think: When is it going to be my time? Am I 
going to be able to live through my teens? It makes you wonder if your friends 
are going to live that long as well.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't think it will change my view of San Marino much because I already knew 
you can't have a 100% safe city. I know that a lot of parents are really 
concerned and they're going to be a lot more careful where their children are 
going. NINA VACCARO 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Blair High 
</P>
<P>
 I was pretty shocked, not only because it was in San Marino, but I have 
relatives who live a couple of houses down from them. It's a peaceful 
residential area.  
</P>
<P>
 If it can happen in San Marino it can happen pretty much anywhere. There's a 
parole officer that lives down the street from us and he said that a lot of 
things do happen in San Marino but they just don't publish them in the 
newspapers or on the news because they like to keep the image of San Marino as 
clean as they can.

 I thoroughly enjoyed Ted Lepon's article ("They Come to Gaze, to Wander, to 
Shop," May 30). I found this article to be a wonderful, refreshing change from 
the sensationalized news depicting the violence of gang drive-by shootings, 
carjackings and other crimes of escalating proportions that so often appears in 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if we would all make it a point to focus our minds and attention on 
the many good things going on in the city -- instead of the bad -- this may be 
the start of getting back our once-beloved City of Angels as well as our 
sanity.

 Fear of crime is among the reasons about 4 million Americans nationwide live 
in gated communities. Homeowners in Whitley Heights, a hilltop neighborhood 
just east of the Hollywood Bowl where Marlene Dietrich and Rudolph Valentino 
once lived, put up money to gate their enclave of about 200 Mediterrean-style 
homes. However, some of their neighbors who live near crime-plagued areas below 
the hills objected, citing a state law which prohibits gating public streets to 
deny access to some while permitting others unrestricted access. The courts 
have agreed with those who dwell in the flatlands. As Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Rita Walters put it: "Instead of gating, we need to involve 
communities more in block clubs and community policing. There is no wall or 
gate high enough to keep out criminals. It's up to the total community." A

those areas."

ALARMS: ANNOYING BUT NECESSARY?

 In Southern California, car alarms are almost as ubiquitous as the vehicles 
they're put in. People complain about loud honking sounds, alarms that talk 
like humans and the ones that "chirp." Several cities are listening to 
residents' complaints. Los Angeles and West Hollywood, for instance, have 
recently passed ordinances banning alarms that chirp and make other annoying 
continuous sounds. Here's what some have to say about the devices: PAULA SAMUEL 
</P>
<P>
 Manager of parking lot, West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 When you have a huge parking lot and you may actually be in a building 1,000 
feet away, you're not going to hear your alarm anyway, so why activate it in a 
quiet, residential area? It is a nuisance. We put up the signs (that read cars 
will be towed if alarms go off) to be considerate to all of our neighbors -- 
not only the residential ones, but the commercial ones as well. WILLIAM C. 
MEECHAM 
</P>
<P>
 Professor of Acoustics, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 Many people are irritated by constant, repetitive noise which they come to 
feel is an imposition on their life. And this kind of stress effect is harmful 
to both physical and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudden noises increase adrenaline for all of us; it's built into our bodies. 
Startling noises increase blood pressure, and we have no way of controlling it. 
I think many people feel there's a kind of arrogance implicit that (those who 
have noisy car alarms think) their property is more important than we are and 
there's a sense of just not caring what that noise does to others. Police Lt. 
MICHAEL GWALTNEY 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park, which ranks first in state for stolen cars, according to the 
National Insurance Crime Bureau 
</P>
<P>
 Car alarms are a good deterrent for car thefts and break-ins. At times they 
can be a nuisance if they have an audible alarm in a residential neighborhood, 
especially if the owner of the vehicle is not around. Then you can't contact 
them to cut the alarm. That's about the only negative side to it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several silent car alarm systems that help us in retrieving stolen 
vehicles. I'd recommend the red bars that go across the steering wheel, kill 
switches. Anything that a private owner can put in his vehicle to prevent it 
from being stolen is a good idea. It's an expense that in today's society we 
unfortunately have to bear. JEFF PRANG 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman for Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, sponsor of ordinance 
that bans chirping alarms, Westchester 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing an alarm go off is extremely annoying. Particularly, it seems, because 
99 out of 100 times it's going off for a reason other than an attempted 
burglary or theft. 
</P>
<P>
 They seem to be too sensitive. Probably what's even more annoying than when 
they go off is the constant chirping that indicates to passersby that an alarm 
is ready to activate at the slightest touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarm manufacturers need to put more thought into their systems so that they 
aren't so intrusive. If you're sitting at home or a restaurant or in a 
classroom and one of those things goes off, you're stuck listening to it for up 
to five minutes. ROB PAYNE 
</P>
<P>
 Manager of retail store specializing in mobile electronics, Orange 
</P>
<P>
 Probably 80% of the alarms out there are going to chirp. There are options to 
override the chirp, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitivity is adjustable on any halfway decent alarm system. That's how you 
can prevent those annoying alarms in the middle of the night. If the installer 
doesn't know what he's doing, he can set the sensitivity so high that a truck 
driving by or a cat jumping on it will set off the alarm.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MODEST PROPOSAL; 
KEEPING RED LINE PROJECT ON TRACK WITH NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT MOONEY, Director of public affairs, Radisson Wilshire Plaza Hotel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Metro Red Line construction is extended from Wilshire Center to Vermont 
Avenue, Hollywood Boulevard and North Hollywood, such adverse community impacts 
as noise, dust, utility service interruptions, access problems and diminished 
visibility will come with it. But the severity of these impacts can be reduced 
if the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is willing to learn from the 
mistakes that have taken place at Wilshire Center since 1991. As one who has 
the perspective of both a representative of a major business affected by the 
subway project and a former public affairs officer for the MTA, I offer the 
following suggestions to the MTA and its contractors for a more effective 
construction mitigation program: 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan construction with the community in mind. There can be no real 
construction mitigation without an understanding of the affected community and 
sensitivity to its needs. At the MTA's Wilshire/Normandie construction site, 
around-the-clock construction with heavy equipment was undertaken in 1992. No 
one seemed to care about the 396-room hotel and a half-dozen apartment 
buildings in the immediate area. Had the needs of the community been properly 
considered, the construction would have either been scheduled differently or an 
effective noise abatement program would have been put in place. Instead, an 
angry public lost sleep for months before nighttime construction was finally 
curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Act, don't just react. Too often, adversely affected business and property 
owners on Wilshire received attention from the MTA staff only after complaining 
about their problems to the press or elected officials. This was true in the 
case of the Construction Enhancement Loan Program, or CELP, an economic 
assistance program that was established only after tremendous pressure was 
exerted by the community. Knowing that subway construction brings adverse 
economic impact, the MTA and its predecessor agencies could have designed an 
effective business assistance program in advance. Instead, the largely 
irrelevant CELP was created after much of the damage had already been done on 
Wilshire. The MTA should recognize that managing issues up front tends to be 
more effective than merely reacting to events after they have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enforce the rules. Writing mitigation measures into construction contracts, 
as the MTA has done, can be effective -- but only if those contracts are 
enforced. One of the major sources of subway-related problems on Wilshire has 
been the repeated violation of contract specifications and city regulations, 
apparently without any real penalties for the contractor. Numerous cases of 
unauthorized truck staging, equipment storage, street closures and driveway 
blockages have been documented on Wilshire. Encroachment of construction onto 
private property has also taken place. The construction manger's contract 
enforcement efforts should be bolstered and strong penalties for noncompliance 
should be established and imposed as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Settle legitimate damage claims in good faith. The MTA has created a 
reputation among some as an agency that would rather pay $1 million to defend 
an unnecessary lawsuit than $100 to settle a legitimate claim. This kind of 
approach is not good government. The MTA, the taxpayers and members of the 
community who suffer construction-related damages would all benefit from the 
adoption of a policy designed to fairly settle claims and avoid costly 
litigation. Standard claims adjusting procedures -- investigation, evaluation 
and negotiation -- are adequate safeguards that will ensure that only 
legitimate and justified claim settlements are made with taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patronize construction-area businesses. To its credit, the MTA has 
occasionally turned to the communities affected by rail construction to obtain 
such things as meeting room space, printing services and catering for special 
events. This is a positive approach that can help struggling businesses survive 
construction, while creating goodwill for the MTA. It should be made a standard 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction mitigation program undertaken by Caltrans during the 
emergency rebuilding of the earthquake-damaged I-10 freeway is an excellent 
example of how public agencies can show sensitivity to the needs of the 
community. While the Caltrans program was not perfect and did not eliminate all 
construction impacts, it went a long way toward demonstrating that government 
can be responsive to the people when it wants to be. Clearly the MTA is also 
capable of such responsiveness. But to achieve positive results in construction 
mitigation as the Metro Red Line expands, it will be necessary for the MTA to 
make a good-faith effort to both learn and apply the important lessons of 
Wilshire Center.

CASSELL'S OFFENSIVE SURGE LEAVES KNICKS BREATHLESS; GAME 3: ROOKIE GUARD'S 
THREE-POINTER AND LATE FREE THROWS POWER ROCKETS TO 93-89 VICTORY AND 2-1 EDGE 
IN SERIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Sam Cassell was on the ground and in obvious pain after getting the wind 
knocked out of him early in the fourth quarter Sunday night, so much that it 
prompted the Houston Rockets to call a 20-second timeout. But he declined to 
come out of the game, if only momentarily to catch his breath, instead staying 
in to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 He knocked the wind out of the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The team that hadn't played well in the fourth quarter in the first two 
outings of the NBA finals and the rookie point guard who mostly played in the 
fourth quarter this season provided a strange coupling at Madison Square 
Garden. They held steady in the face of another impending disaster and he took 
it from there, making the go-ahead three-point basket and then sinking four 
consecutive free throws in the final 22 seconds to give the Rockets a 93-89 
victory in Game 3 and a 2-1 series edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big character win for us," Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a couple of fronts, foremost, for the Rockets as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off back-to-back disastrous fourth quarters at home, one which they 
survived and the other that did them in, they entered Madison Square Garden, 
shooting a combined seven of 37 in those 24 minutes. Then, Sunday, they had a 
stretch of 11 consecutive misses and five turnovers that reached back to the 
end of the third period. The offense consisted of four free throws, and two of 
those were from illegal defense calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, Cassell broke the drought with a driving layup with 7:18 left, 
pushing a Rocket lead that was 14 in the fourth quarter back to four, 75-71. It 
was a nice warm-up to his personal character test, this 24-year-old from 
Florida State who had more turnovers than assists the first two games (seven to 
six) while going four of 12 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 That cushion held up until Patrick Ewing's 18-footer from the left side with 
2:52 remaining put the Knicks ahead, 82-81. The Rockets regained the lead, then 
New York went up again, finally at 88-86 on a basket by Derek Harper with 53 
seconds to go. Welcome to Houston's gut check. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, of course, answered by getting the ball inside to Hakeem 
Olajuwon. But when the defense collapsed around him, part of the Knick tactic 
that limited the regular-season MVP to 21 points on eight-of-20 shooting, 
Olajuwon whipped the ball from the left post to Cassell, standing just beyond 
the three-point arc and straight out from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making my move," Olajuwon said, "but I saw an opening. And it was wide 
open. I'd rather take a three than a two. That's a chance I wanted to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell went up as Harper started to run at him with a raised arm. The shot 
got off, then went through with 32.6 seconds left to put the Rockets up, 89-88. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dream (Olajuwon) created it all," said Cassell, whose 15 points were one more 
than all of the New York reserves. "He had three guys on him. He made the pass. 
I made the shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks called a timeout. When Charles Oakley couldn't find someone to take 
the inbounds pass, they called another. Oakley got the ball to Harper on the 
next try, but disaster struck: Ewing, setting a pick a few feet from the basket 
on the left side in hopes of springing John Starks free for a jumper or pass 
inside, got called for a moving screen by official Jake O'Donnell. Offensive 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make a call like that, especially at that point in the game," Ewing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said O'Donnell, one of the league's most respected referees: "It was a 
judgment call. The play was a pick and roll. He moved his hip out (immediately 
before) and then he did it again. I'm not gonna let it be twice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks were now forced to foul to stop the clock. Harper did the honors 
when he grabbed Cassell with 22 seconds left. Cassell made them both. Starks 
made one free throw with 3.9 left for New York and purposely missed the second 
in hopes of an offensive rebound and tying basket. No luck. Otis Thorpe got the 
loose ball for the Rockets and called a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cassell took the entry pass, he was intentionally fouled with 2.4 seconds 
left. He made both again, providing the 93-89 margin and another chapter in an 
unusual season, when he went from No. 24 pick in the draft to taking over Scott 
Brooks' role as the fourth-quarter replacement for starter Kenny Smith as 
Tomjanovich continues to platoon his point guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking a chance, it's a gamble," the coach said of his unusual rotation. 
"If it doesn't turn out right, morale suffers." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no concern about that today. Everything turned out just right. 
</P>
<P>
 * GOOD FOR THE PRESS: No one is enjoying the Knicks' wild ride through the 
playoffs more than the New York tabloids. C4

UNLIKELY HEROES DIRECT ANGELS PAST TIGERS, 8-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels chucked their recent method of operation Sunday, refusing to cave 
in to their usual pattern of wretched starting pitching and stagnant offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the bullpen closer came through against the Detroit Tigers in an 8-6 
victory before 22,381 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about those likely to yank the Angels out of their weekend doldrums and 
Chuck Finley, Mark Langston, Chili Davis, Bo Jackson and Tim Salmon quickly 
come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's heroes were a rookie pitcher, who worshipped the 1984 World Series 
champion Tigers, and two singles hitters who hit back-to-back home runs in a 
four-run fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 And let's not forget the beleaguered closer, who fashioned his 10th save by 
keeping the major leagues' leading home-run hitting team scoreless in 1 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Brian Anderson headed the roll call of unexpected performers, 
pitching 7 1/3 innings and limiting the Tigers to five hits and four runs with 
five strikeouts and four walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive punch came with a two-run homer by shortstop Gary DiSarcina, only 
his third this season, and a solo homer by third baseman Spike Owen, his 
second. No one will ever confuse DiSarcina and Owen with Maris and Mantle -- or 
even Chad Curtis and Rex Hudler -- but the Angels were grateful nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina and Owen have combined to hit 51 homers in 5,784 career at-bats, so 
what were the odds they would hit consecutive homers? 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Joe Grahe, who had a 12.27 earned-run average in his past four 
appearances before Sunday, held off the Tigers in the eighth and ninth and the 
Angels won for only the third time in their past 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson took a three-hitter into the eighth inning before giving up 
consecutive homers to Chris Gomez and Travis Fryman. Anderson then was replaced 
by Mark Leiter, who allowed the Tigers to come within 7-6 before Grahe entered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of innings I just wasn't myself," said Anderson, making his 
second start since returning from a broken thumb suffered May 6. "But then I 
was able to get into a little groove. To be effective I have to be a little 
brash. And I was being passive." 
</P>
<P>
 He probably went a little overboard in the sixth, hitting Fryman in the back 
with a fastball. Fryman took a few tentative steps toward the mound and 
Anderson walked to meet him. The dugouts and bullpens emptied but there was no 
rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Anderson (4-1) seemed emotionally torn about the incident. It fed his 
drive to stay aggressive, but he could see why Fryman was miffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps get your adrenaline pumping," Anderson said. "He wasn't happy. If 
somebody hits me with a fastball in the back I'm going to be mad, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson kept rolling after that, faltering only when Gomez, a former 
All-American at Long Beach State, stepped to the plate with one out and the 
Angels ahead, 7-2, in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 That Gomez and then Fryman would homer figured. After all, it was the sixth 
time this season the Tigers have hit back-to-back homers. Besides, Detroit 
battered Angel pitching for 32 runs and 46 hits, including 14 doubles and 10 
homers, in winning three of the four games. 
</P>
<P>
 By homering twice Sunday, the Tigers extended their homer streak to 19 
consecutive games. The major league record is 25, set by the 1941 New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the Tigers, who lead the majors with 93 homers, went into the 
game having scored 89 runs and batted .312 in 11 games this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson seemed unfazed by it all, giving the Angels a rare standout 
performance by a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kicked our tails for three days, so it's good to come back and win one," 
Manager Marcel Lachemann said.

CANDIOTTI STOPS CUBS WITHOUT BULLPEN HELP; BASEBALL: BELEAGUERED RELIEVERS TAKE 
DAY OFF AS DODGERS END TRIP WITH A 2-1 VICTORY AT WRIGLEY FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a Todd Worrell sighting Sunday at Wrigley Field in the eighth 
inning, but he never got into the game. Tom Candiotti, hanging on to a one-run 
lead, stranded the potential tying run at second base in the ninth inning of 
the Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the Dodgers' third victory during a nine-game trip, and they all came 
on complete games, underscoring the struggles of the bullpen. But Candiotti, 
who hasn't gone more than seven innings in his last three starts, said he 
didn't feel pressure to go nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't think like that," said Candiotti (5-2), who pitched his fourth 
complete game, tying him for the league lead. "You always expect to go nine 
when it's your day to pitch. . . . The way the bullpen is right now has no 
bearing on how I approach the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, who has blown his last four save opportunities, said he was throwing 
in the bullpen to work on a few things. "If the manager feels he needs me, I 
was ready," Worrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Sammy Sosa, whose home run in the seventh inning tied the game, came 
to the plate with two outs in the ninth, Manager Tom Lasorda stayed with 
Candiotti. 
</P>
<P>
 And after Sosa doubled to put the tying run on second, Worrell was not 
summoned. Candiotti, who walked none, gave up five hits and faced only 31 
batters, retired Derrick May on a groundout to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel bad for the way (the bullpen) has been giving up runs lately," 
Candiotti said. "One of these guys has to say, 'Let's go,' that's what they 
have to do. Hopefully, someone will have a good outing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers won two of three games from the Cubs, the only series they won on 
the trip. They were swept by the Atlanta Braves and lost two of three to the 
Florida Marlins before facing the Cubs, who have lost 10 of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was marred by controversy, with Jose Offerman and Worrell being 
lectured about insubordination, Jim Gott undergoing an appendectomy in Chicago, 
and grumblings about Orel Hershiser playing too much golf on the road.  
</P>
<P>
 But nothing has caused morale to drop more than the struggles of the bullpen, 
which has blown 15 of 24 saves, including three during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been impressed with our club in so many ways, the only thing stopping 
us from reaching the point where we should be is that we have blown those 
saves," Lasorda said. "Once we get that straightened out, that will make it 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
 Players say their consolation is that after leaving Los Angeles with a 
three-game lead in the National League West, they now lead the second-place 
Colorado Rockies by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's going to win this division two games over .500," said Tim Wallach, 
whose home run in the second inning was his third in four games. "We haven't 
played well the last couple of weeks. Everybody is pointing at our pitching, 
but we haven't swung the bat well the last 1 1/2 weeks or so and we have to put 
more runs on the board than we have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach's homer, his 16th, came against starter Anthony Young (3-5), who held 
the Dodgers to five hits in 7 1/3 innings and left the game in the eighth, 
trailing, 2-1, with one out and two on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not frustrated, I came from the Mets and they were last in hitting and 
pitching last year," said Young, whose three victories are a career high. "The 
guys are trying hard. It seems like every time I go out on the mound, I'm 
facing Cy Young." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler hit Young's first pitch of the eighth inning off the ivy in 
right-center field for a double. He went to third on a sacrifice bunt by 
Offerman and scored on a single by Mike Piazza, who has 55 runs batted in, 25 
in his last 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti, whose sore neck had been troubling him the past three games, said 
he has worked hard between starts to regain sound mechanics. Sunday, he mixed 
in some sliders, fastballs anda variety of curveballs, but his knuckleball had 
the Cubs swinging at air. Except for Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sosa hit a 2-and-2 knuckleball to center for his 15th homer of the 
season, Piazza was impressed. "Mike walked up to me and said, 'Hey dude, how 
did he hit that?" Candiotti said.

MORNING BRIEFING: JAPANESE REPORTERS GET TO ROOT OF ADDING A LITTLE TEETH TO 
SWING 
</P>

 Dan Gladden, a former major leaguer who now plays for the Yomiuri Giants in 
Japan, told Dan Barreiro of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis of his problems 
with the Japanese media: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really rude and follow you around everywhere. And some of the 
questions are bizarre. They ask what kind of teeth you have, as if that has 
something to do with being a good hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if your ears are a certain size they think you can run fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the record for the highest free-throw percentage in a 
seven-game NBA finals series? 
</P>
<P>
 No obstacle: Matt Williams, balding San Francisco Giant third baseman, whose 
22 home runs have him on pace to challenge Roger Maris' record of 61 in a 
season, on being told that the stress of chasing Babe Ruth's record in 1961 
caused Maris' hair to fall out: 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't have that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary: Red Rock, a Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame bull, died last Wednesday in Red 
Bluff, Calif., at age 18. "He's probably the most famous person in Northern 
California," said John Gowney, the bull's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 A lost skill?Since Vince Coleman stole 109 bases for the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1987, only one player, Rickey Henderson of Oakland, the all-time steals 
leader, has as many as 90 in a season.  
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Carr of the Florida Marlins was the leading base stealer in the National 
League in 1993 with 57 -- the lowest total for an N.L. leader since 
Cincinnati's Bobby Tolan had 57 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher education: Kansas Chancellor Gene Budig said he is starting to learn 
about one of the more awkward duties of his new job as president of the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I signed my first baseball the other day. It's really kind of hard to do," he 
said. "George Brett told me there is a technique, and he's going to give me a 
crash course." 
</P>
<P>
 Grave consequences: Beth Daniel on the prospect of making the LPGA Hall of 
Fame: "I feel like at times if I don't make the Hall of Fame, my family is 
going to bury me and the LPGA is going to come along and chisel into my 
tombstone, 'But she didn't make the Hall of Fame.' " 
</P>

 Global coverage: What do Bophuthatswana, Guinea Bisau, Burkina Faso, Gabon, 
Kazakhstan, Sao Tome, St. Kitts., Turkmenistan, Essex and the Republic of Palau 
have in common?

<P>
 They're among the 117 foreign language markets getting the NBA finals on TV.

<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1935 James J. Braddock scored a unanimous 
15-round decision over Max Baer to win the heavyweight championship in New 
York.

MIKE PENNER: SOCCER ARRIVES IN TIME TO SPICE UP SUMMER

 U nconventional wisdom of the day . . .  
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94: One way or another, a rousing hockey season comes to an end 
Tuesday night in New York. Meanwhile, the Knicks and the Rockets threaten to 
bomb pro basketball back to the Stone Age. The American League West race is 
already a bore. The Angels are as lousy as ever, except with no Buck Rodgers 
around to keep us amused. The Dodgers are in a pennant race that will be 
rendered moot within weeks by a player strike. Wimbledon will be won by Steffi 
Graf and whichever man hits the most aces. Sounds to me like a great time to 
host a monthlong soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Red card: A wonderful soccer invention that, if adopted by the NBA, would have 
left the Knicks with three players to start Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Knicks-Rockets: The least attractive NBA final since . . . Seattle-Washington, 
'78-'79? No, that matchup had Elvin Hayes, Wes Unseld, Gus Williams and Dennis 
Johnson. Milwaukee-Baltimore '71? Earl Monroe, Oscar Robertson and Lew Alcindor 
played in that one. Syracuse-Ft. Wayne '55? It appears we have a winner. The 
centers in that series were Johnny Kerr and Larry Foust; Patrick Ewing and 
Hakeem Olajuwon probably rate a slight edge. But that was 39 years ago, and the 
winning team did manage to break 100 points twice in that series. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing vs. Olajuwon: Get Starks and Maxwell and Mason and all the rest off the 
floor. Now. Everybody out of the building except the two big guys. Let them 
have at it, one-on-one, all the way to 21. As soon as we have a winner, let's 
shake hands, shut it down and promise to do a better job next season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers: All those who have had it up to here with "1940," raise your 
right hand. Not you, Mike Richter . . . oops, too late, Canuck goal, glove 
side. This obsessing over some dusty date in hockey history reached an absurd 
extreme Saturday in Vancouver, when ESPN's Bill Clement looked at his watch as 
the horn sounded on Game 6 and noted, "And in a minute or two, it will be 7:40 
p.m. And in military time, that is 19:40." Yes, and if you take the number of 
goals scored this series, multiply by 169, add in the wind-chill factor in 
downtown Winnipeg on March 3, subtract the shoe sizes of every member of the 
Howe family and divide by pi, that is also 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ghosts of Madison Square Garden: I'm wondering how they made it to 
Vancouver in time for Game 6. On Air Canada through Toronto? Or United through 
Chicago? 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Carson: He has been scratched by two different coaches on two different 
teams in back-to-back Stanley Cup finals. This is believed to be an NHL record. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Keenan: How does a guy negotiating a new job with the Detroit Red Wings 
during the middle of the Stanley Cup finals tell his players to "stay focused?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sam McMaster: The new Kings general manager has been on the job two weeks, 
hasn't traded Marty McSorley or ticked off Wayne Gretzky or gutted a top 
scoring line yet. So far, he's been a big improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille: Don't be surprised if he or restricted free-agent Rob Blake 
are traded by training camp. The new Kings ownership has shallow pockets and 
slashing the payroll is the first order of business. The salad days are clearly 
over, which means Gretzky has probably seen his last Cup final. Unless he's 
traded, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Augie Garrido: Every other year, his Cal State Fullerton Titans go to Omaha 
and brighten the dreary local sports scene for a week or so. What was the most 
incredible story this time? Playing three games in 24 hours in Stillwater, 
Okla., and winning two of them, including the clincher against host team 
Oklahoma State, just to qualify for the World Series? Or scoring 20 runs to 
eliminate defending champion LSU? Or reaching the semifinals and having the 
tying run on third with no outs in the bottom of the 12th, despite possessing a 
fraction of the talent the '92 Titans brought to Rosenblatt? Augie, the break 
in the weather did all of us good. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Powell: He was 0 for Omaha heading into the last game against Georgia 
Tech, hitless in 22 College World Series at-bats spanning 1992 and '94, and the 
natives were starting to wonder, "So what's the big deal with this guy?" Nice 
to see him break out with three hits and put the tying run 90 feet away in the 
12th. A sacrifice fly there would have been nicer still, but that, I'm afraid, 
got chopped out of the athletic budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton: In little more than six months, Fullerton sent two of its 
men's teams -- soccer and baseball -- to the NCAA final four. Is there another 
school that can make the same claim in 1993-94? One that has money? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Shumard: He always wanted to build a better basketball gym, and now, as 
an assistant AD at Long Beach State, he shall have one. The 49ers begin play in 
the sparkling new Pyramid this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 French Open: When I awoke Sunday morning and turned on the television, much to 
my surprise, the men's singles final was no longer in progress.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; KNICKS READY FOR STORM AFTER GAME 3 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minutes after the New York Knicks lost Sunday night, the three local tabloids 
began thinking up their back-page headline, looking for that perfect bombshell. 
One could only imagine what they might come up with: 
</P>
<P>
 From the New York Daily News: "IT'S ALL OVER!" 
</P>
<P>
 From the New York Post: "STICK A FORK IN 'EM!" 
</P>
<P>
 From Newsday: "METS BEAT EXPOS, 5-4" 
</P>
<P>
 Or something like that. Gotham longs to fall head over heels for Pat Riley's 
Knicks but . . . can't . . . quite commit. One moment, the local darlings are 
on the brink of something big, as they were when they won at Houston on Friday. 
The next, the knuckleheads fall flat as they did in Sunday's 93-89 loss to the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time, the Knicks lost in New York, Game 5 against the Indiana Pacers, 
the News trotted out "GAG CITY" and the Post went with "CHOKERS." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a Knick, the lesson is clear: win or else. Since Sunday didn't turn 
out so well, here comes "or else." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different here than other places," said Charles Smith, who has reason to 
know, having been groomed in ambient anonymity in the Sports Arena only to 
become ground zero in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as players, we just stick with one another. There's no shower before the 
storm. It just comes down. You know that you just have to deal with it, forget 
about it, try to ignore it and do what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on is the last all-out, downtown newspaper war with one 
threadbare NBA finalist caught in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the beloved Knicks are still the '70 champions with Red, Clyde 
and the Captain (Red Holzman, Walt Frazier and Willis Reed, respectively). They 
were teamwork personified. New Yorkers thought their ascent symbolized 
something about urban America and would Make Things Better. People said those 
kinds of things back then and if they learned better, they still love those 
oldies but goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Knicks are an odorless, flavorless crew with just enough personality 
for a photo-op. Their star, Patrick Ewing, lives across the river in a condo in 
Ft. Lee, N.J., and after the season, goes "home" to Washington, D.C. He does 
few interviews and rarely consents to talk even to the house-owned Madison 
Square Garden network. Frazier, now a Knick announcer and still the most 
colorful personality employed by the franchise, has called Ewing "kind of 
aloof." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Knicks are hard-working guys who are with the program, give or 
take one Anthony Mason. They're polite but say little more than what Riley has 
told them after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Riley watchers have delighted in putting together 
glossaries of his latest terms. In the '80s with the Lakers, it was "making a 
statement" and "peripheral opponents." 
</P>
<P>
 Now "come with more force" pops up most nights. Sometimes when an ace mimic 
like Greg Anthony is running through Riley's cliches, you're tempted to look 
behind him to see if Riles is back there, like Shari Lewis with Lamb Chop. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, like any other burg, would forgive anything of champions, but the 
Knicks, 60-game winners last season, were torpedoed by injuries to Smith, Doc 
Rivers and John Starks. Now they have all they can do to score 90 points and 
can never, ever let anyone outwork them. When they do, they get Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Game 5 against Indiana, we had a problem," said Riley, alluding to Reggie 
Miller's 25-point fourth-quarter. "Game 7 (against the Pacers), we were down 
12. Game 1 of this series, we were down 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the answer . . . but we have not played with the kind of 
intensity until it's almost a desperate situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the opponents want to win, too, and sometimes, like the Rockets on 
Sunday, they're the ones feeling desperate. The Rockets took it to the Knicks 
all night and when their little cool breeze, Sam Cassell, dropped that hammer 
on the home team, it was a fitting finish for Rudy Tomjanovich's characters, 
who passed a big character test. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy T runs a Riley-style program, too, so if Friday's basketball was 
stirring, the quotes, as they have been all week, were Pablum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon, asked about Cassell, said he doesn't consider him a rookie 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked when he thought Cassell began to step forward, Hakeem repeated that 
Cassell isn't a rookie any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell said this was a team victory and they were taking it one game at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks dressed and cleared out fast. Hello desperation, their old friend.

 Lee Janzen didn't look like a man worried about a jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with a $216,000 check in his pocket for winning the Buick Classic on 
Sunday at Harrison, N.Y. Not with the millstone of a yearlong slump finally 
removed from his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen shot a 66 in the three-stroke victory over Ernie Els. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is true, someone told him, that no tournament winner has gone to the 
U.S. Open the next week and also won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet," he shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Janzen who emerged 51 weeks ago with a surprising victory in the 1993 U.S. 
Open, appears to be back. Just in time for the 1994 Open, which begins 
Thursday.

 Dave Stockton salvaged a par out of a horrible drive on the 18th hole and beat

ARIZONA ST. COACH BROCK DIES AT 57 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Brock, 57, the Arizona State baseball coach whose battle with cancer 
forced him to miss much of the recent College World Series, died Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock, one of college baseball's winningest coaches, died of liver and colon 
cancer, said Mark Brand, sports information director at ASU. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock sat out ASU's game against Oklahoma at Omaha on June 6 because of a 
reaction to medicine. The next day, he returned to Tempe on the advice of his 
family doctor and checked into Desert Samaritan Hospital in Mesa, where he 
remained until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 His team was eliminated in a 13-5 loss to eventual champion Oklahoma on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock was the only coach to win national championships with American Legion, 
junior-college and major-college teams. He had a 1,100-440 record in 23 years 
at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, the Sun Devils won two College World Series titles and 
finished second four times in 11 other trips to the national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are indebted to the wonderful fans and our friends in the community who 
supported us throughout this challenging time," said Pat Brock, his wife of 37 
years. "The outpouring of friendship and concern has been unbelievable. People 
have been so wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic director Fred Miller hired Brock in 1972 on a temporary basis, but 
the Sun Devils' 64-6 record and runner-up finish in the CWS paved the way for a 
permanent position. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1976 team set the school record for victories with a 65-10 mark, and the 
1977 squad (57-12) won the national championship and earned Brock his first 
Coach of the Year selection by the American Association of College Baseball 
Coaches. He got his second CWS title and second AACBA national honor in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock had his only losing season (31-35) in 1985, a year after the NCAA 
stripped Arizona State of 14 scholarships because of irregularities in the 
team's work-study program. That was the first season in an eight-season stretch 
during which the team qualified for the CWS only twice, in 1987 and 1988.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WHITE'S HOMER HELPS BLUE JAYS GAIN ON YANKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten days ago, the last-place Toronto Blue Jays were trailing the first-place 
New York Yankees by 10 games in the American League East after being swept in a 
three-game series with the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays are still in last place, but things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 3-1 victory over the Yankees on Sunday at New York, the Blue Jays are 
only 5 1/2 games back. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon White hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning, and Pat Hentgen (8-5) 
allowed three hits in eight innings as the Blue Jays took three of four games 
in the weekend series. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had won today we'd be right back where we started before this 
series," said White, who went three for four. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen, referring to the Yankees' two-game sweep at Yankee Stadium last 
month, said, "They beat us up good in New York. I guess things weren't looking 
too bright for us back then, but this is pretty much the same nucleus of guys 
who won a World Series last year. We were in a bit of a funk for a while. But I 
think we've turned things around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, meanwhile, have gone 3-10 since a 32-13 start. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 7, Texas 2 -- David Cone became the league's first 10-game winner 
with the victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone (10-2), who has won nine of his last 10 decisions, joined Atlanta's Greg 
Maddux as baseball's only 10-game winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone gave up three hits in 7 2/3 innings, struck out three and walked two. He 
carried a two-hit shutout into the eighth before the Rangers closed to 6-2 with 
a pair of unearned runs. Cone leads the league with a 2.41 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gagne supplied the offense for Cone with a run-scoring double in the 
third and a two-run triple in the seventh. Felix Jose added a solo homer in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 12, Milwaukee 6 -- Teddy Higuera's troubles continued as the Brewer 
left-hander threw only 25 pitches and gave up four runs, three hits and a walk 
before being pulled with nobody out in the second inning at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians ended up scoring eight runs in the second, with Albert Belle's 
grand slam off Jaime Navarro capping the outburst. Navarro gave up five of the 
runs on four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last four starts, Higuera has allowed 20 earned runs in 9 1/3 innings 
for a 19.29 ERA. He was skipped in the rotation once during that span with a 
tired arm. His ERA went from 7.19 to 7.74 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teddy tells me he's not hurt, but I'm concerned," Milwaukee Manager Phil 
Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Higuera, in the final season of a four-year $13.5 million contract, has won 
just five times since rotator cuff surgery in 1991. General Manager Sal Bando 
said Higuera could be headed for the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 8, Boston 4 -- Cal Ripken, Rafael Palmeiro and Leo Gomez homered at 
Boston for the Orioles, who have won six of seven and moved within one game of 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben McDonald (9-4) allowed three runs and six hits in eight-plus innings as 
the Orioles completed a sweep of the Red Sox. His 50th career victory was 
interrupted by a 2:01 rain delay in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken drove in a run with a double in the first and a two-run homer, his 
seventh, off the light tower above the left field wall in the sixth. Gomez led 
off the third with his seventh homer and Palmeiro, who had three hits, led off 
the fourth with his 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 6, Chicago 2 -- Kirby Puckett had three hits and drove in three runs 
at Minneapolis to move into the major league lead in runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett homered, singled and doubled in his first three at-bats to increase 
his RBI total to 63, one more than Toronto's Joe Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 11, Seattle 2 -- Ruben Sierra went four for five with five RBIs and 
Stan Javier hit a two-run homer for the Athletics at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra had an RBI single and a run-scoring double before hitting his 15th 
homer in the eighth inning. Javier went three for five.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BENES STRIKES OUT 12 AS PADRES SWEEP GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Diego Padres, who hadn't won a road series this season, completed a 
three-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Benes (4-9) struck out 12 in a 5-2 victory Sunday to take over the major 
league strikeout lead with 100. He gave up six hits and walked none. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't try to strike people out," Benes said. "I just try to make good 
pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Benes struck out the side in the seventh inning for a string of five 
consecutive strikeouts, but was lifted after the Giants scored an unearned run 
in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Hoffman worked the ninth for his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams hit his league-leading 22nd home run in the fourth inning, but 
the Giants still lost their fourth in a row and sixth straight at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 3, Cincinnati 2 -- The Rockies formed a line and exchanged high-fives 
after beating the Reds for their first victory in 11 games at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes doubled home a run in the second, hit a solo homer in the fifth that 
bounced off the top of the wall, and doubled and scored the tie-breaking run on 
Nelson Liriano's ninth-inning single off Hector Carrasco (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Reed (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings, and Bruce Ruffin got lucky in 
the ninth while getting his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
 After Deion Sanders walked to start the inning, Barry Larkin grounded up the 
middle. But Ruffin stuck his right leg out and deflected the ball directly to 
first baseman Andres Galarraga for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 3, Houston 1 -- Greg Maddux gave up 11 hits at Houston but still 
became the first 10-game winner in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take any win I can get," said Maddux (10-2), who is trying to become the 
first pitcher to win three consecutive Cy Young Awards. He lowered his ERA to 
1.38, also the best mark in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start thinking about 20 wins or pitching in the World Series or the Cy 
Young Award, you'll stop pitching," he said. "I can throw the pitches I make, 
everything else is out of my control." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux walked none and struck out four in his fourth complete game. He was 
helped by three double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Montreal 4 -- Kevin McReynolds, battling back problems that put 
him on the disabled list in the middle of May, homered twice, tripled and drove 
in four runs for the Mets at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied at 4 when McReynolds led off the eighth inning with a home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets stopped a five-game losing streak, while the Expos lost for only the 
fourth time in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 McReynolds' fourth home run of the season gave him 12 two-homer games in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Florida 1 -- Dave Clark went four for four and had four RBIs and 
rookie Jon Lieber gave up only five hits in eight innings as the Pirates 
finished off a four-game sweep of the Marlins at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark had a two-run homer and two doubles. He is eight for 10 lifetime against 
Marlin starter Dave Weathers (6-5), who is 0-3 in his career against 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 7, St. Louis 2 -- Danny Jackson got his eighth victory of the 
season and the Phillies scored four quick runs after Cardinals starter Bob 
Tewksbury was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (8-1) gave up eight hits, struck out three and walked one in eight 
innings. His last loss was on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (8-5), who lost his fourth straight start, left the game in the 
fourth inning after being struck just above the right ankle by Milt Thompson's 
line-drive single. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays of Tewksbury's leg will be taken today. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's hit scored Jim Eisenreich, breaking a 1-1 tie, and Tewksbury then 
allowed a single to Kim Batiste before leaving the game.

 In Denmark, the national team's two most gifted players, brothers Brian and 
Michael Laudrup, both will be playing with new clubs in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laudrup is leaving his Italian club, Fiorentina, to join Glasgow Rangers 
of Scotland on a three-year, $3.3-million contract. Michael, meanwhile, is 
headed from Spanish champion Barcelona to rival Real Madrid for the next two 
seasons.

 In Italy, a court in Genoa sentenced Uruguayan international forward Carlos 
Aguilera to two years in jail for possession of cocaine and for his involvement 
in a group that brought prostitutes into Genoa from South America.

 Aguilera, who has long since returned to Uruguay, had his lawyers appeal the

 In England, the Football Assn., English soccer's ruling body, has bowed to the 
inevitable and announced that the annual F.A. Cup will be sponsored from now 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 The F.A. Cup is the oldest knockout competition in the world, dating from 
1871. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates are that the successful bidder will have to fork out as much as $30 
million for the right to have the sponsor's name associated with the Cup.

 In France, embattled Olympique Marseille, demoted to the second division next 
season after being found guilty of match-fixing, has been sold to an 
unidentified bank in the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank bought a majority of the former French and European champion's stock 
from Bernard Tapie for a reported $20 million through a British-based 
subsidiary.

 In Japan, 1990 World Cup goal-scoring hero Salvatore (Toto) Schillaci of Italy 
was suspended for two J-League matches after insulting a referee while playing 
for his club team, Jubilo Iwata. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hiroshima Sanfrecce won the championship of the first half of the 
J-League season when its latest victory gave it a 17-4 record and an 
unassailable lead in the race.

 In Portugal, FC Porto won the Portuguese Cup by defeating Sporting Lisbon, 
2-1, in a replay of the final after the first match ended in a scoreless tie 
after extra time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 12th Cup victory for Porto, whose coach, Bobby Robson, had been 
fired by Sporting in December. Robson coached England into the semifinals of

 Bebeto scored on a penalty kick and set up two other goals as Brazil defeated 
El Salvador, 4-0, Sunday at Fresno in its final exhibition before the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brazilian reporters fought with security guards as post-match 
interviews degenerated into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters and stadium security men exchanged punches and kicks while other 
journalists shouted anti-American abuse at guards in front of the door to the 
team dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalists had been waiting for players to emerge for the traditional 
Brazilian-style interviews in which reporters talk to players leaving the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 But security men and police officers called in to guard the dressing room door 
said they had been given orders not to allow any interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to (defender) Branco when a guard grabbed me by the elbow," 
said Globo television reporter Tino Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled my elbow away. Then he punched me in the stomach. At that point, 
Branco stopped talking and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, dozens of my colleagues started kicking the guard from behind. I 
was touched by their solidarity."

 ENGLAND'S LAST STAND Engalnd, which failed to quality for the 1994 World Cup, 
has won the event once, in 1966 when it played host to the tournament. Led by 
centerbacks Bobby Moore and Jack Charlton, the English employed a 4-4-2 
alignment that featured a smothering defense and methodical attack. In the 
final at Wembley Stadium, England defeated West Germany, 4-2, in overtime, and 
Geoff Hurst recorded the only hat trick in a World Cup final. Source: Times

 Making amends for her loss to Sardula in the Kentucky Oaks, Lakeway rolled to 
a 4 1/4-length victory over 27-1 shot Cinnamon Sugar in the $200,000 Mother 
Goose Sunday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning for the fifth time in six races, Lakeway went head-and-head with 7-10 
favorite Inside Information for most of the 1 1/8 miles, put her away after 
some rapid splits (45 1/5 and 1:08 3/5) and won in a stakes-record 1:46 2/5 
under Kent Desormeaux.She paid $4.60 as the second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Kent to ride like it was a match race," said trainer Gary Jones. 
"That's what it looked like on paper. Don't let (Inside Information) get too 
far away." BOB MIESZERSKI

HOLLYWOOD PARK; HOLLYWOOD WILDCAT ENDS HER DROUGHT WITH VICTORY IN GAMELY 
HANDICAP 
</P>

<P>
 Owners Irving and Marge Cowan had to go four months without seeing Hollywood 
Wildcat run, but the wait proved worthwhile Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Making her first appearance since she had a five-race winning streak ended in 
the La Canada Stakes on Feb. 5 at Santa Anita, 1993's champion 3-year-old filly 
returned with a 2 1/4-length victory over 19-1 shot Mz. Zill Bear in the 
$160,400 Gamely Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hollywood Wildcat remained unbeaten in three starts on the turf, 
Flawlessly had a victory streak of her own ended. The two-time Eclipse Award 
winner finished third Sunday at 7-10 odds, her first defeat in seven starts on 
the Hollywood Park turf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too far off the pace being set by Skimble and Bel's Starlet early, 
Hollywood Wildcat dropped back to last after six furlongs and looked like she 
might be done. However, Eddie Delahoussaye had decided to wait, and when he 
asked the 4-year-old Kris S filly, she accelerated and went on to win in 1:46 
2/5 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She broke awful sharp, she was awful fresh," said Delahoussaye. "Going into 
the first turn, I had to have a pretty good hold of her, but as she reached the 
backside, she relaxed real well. I knew she'd be all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horses started passing her, but she's got a good turn of foot, so I decided I 
may as well wait. As we neared the three-eighths pole, I was a little concerned 
about getting through, but it broke perfect for us. Boy, when I called on her, 
she just took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really took to this course, loved it. I told (trainer) Neil (Drysdale) he 
might as well keep her on the grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly, who hadn't run since Nov. 28, was beaten by five lengths, but she 
did break poorly and was caught wide on the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was off very slow," said Chris McCarron. "I got left by a length. She was 
a little antsy in the gate today and she's not usually like that. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I asked her to run too soon. I made a premature move. I misjudged 
(fourth-place finisher Empress Club). I thought I'd be able to get by her and 
be only three-wide around the next turn. As it was, (Empress Club) went on and 
it turned out I got sent out to the outside like I was on the end of a ski 
rope." 
</P>

 Sandy King, the assistant horse identifier, was given a 15-day suspension by 
Hollywood Park stewards Ingrid Fermin, Pete Pedersen and Tom Ward in the 
aftermath of the Johnny Mc-Stalvoy incident, which led to the two horses 
switching identities for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 King was on duty at the receiving barn on April 29 when the horse thought to 
be Johnny Mc was brought over for the night's fifth race. It was discovered 
later it was actually Stalvoy who finished fifth that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 In other rulings regarding the incident, trainers Bill Spawr and Craig Lewis 
were each fined $1,500 for California Horse Racing Board rule violations. 
Spawr, who claimed Stalvoy at Santa Anita, but ended up with Johnny Mc for a 
time, was cited for bringing the incorrect horse to the receiving barn, penalty 
for a late declaration and failure to start and run. Lewis, who thought he had 
Johnny Mc, but actually had Stalvoy before he was claimed by Bob Hess, Jr., on 
April 29, was fined for running the incorrect horse and "duties of trainer." 
</P>
<P>
 State veterinarian William Gray Gerber was fined $200 for "inaccurate 
procedures followed in the receiving barn." 
</P>

 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery ailment that has bothered Eddie Delahoussaye for several months 
has been diagnosed as sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinus area. 
Delahoussaye said people who live in areas with high air pollution are more 
susceptible to the ailment. He has been taking antibiotics for the last six 
days and will continue to do so for a total of 10 days. If the condition 
doesn't improve, he said, he might have to undergo surgery. Delahoussaye, who 
gave up the mount on Strodes Creek in the Belmont Stakes due to the problem, 
will visit Dr. Peter Gabor again today. On the recommendation of trainer Bobby 
Frankel, Delahoussaye visited Gabor a week ago and underwent blood tests for 
three kinds of viruses. . . . Hollywood Wildcat and Flawlessly probably will 
meet in the Beverly Hills Handicap on July 3. . . . Arcangues, expected to make 
his next start in the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup on July 2, worked a half-mile 
in 49 4/5 Sunday.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; SCHUMACHER COASTS TO CANADIAN GRAND PRIX VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Schumacher pulled away from the field on the opening lap and won the 
Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal on Sunday for his fifth victory in six Formula 
One races this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, driving a Benetton Ford, started from the pole and by the end of 
the first 90-second lap around the Circuit Gilles Villenueve had a lead of 
1.767 seconds over Jean Alesi's Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 That was as close as anyone would get to Schumacher, who won the race by 
39.660 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Hill of Britain, driving a Williams Renault, took over second on the 
31st lap when Alesi pitted and held the spot at the finish. But Hill couldn't 
get close to Schumacher, who led by more than 30 seconds by the time they came 
out following a pit stop on the 40th lap. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rusty Wallace moved past Dale Earnhardt three turns from the end of the UAW-GM 
Teamwork 500 to salvage a victory in a confusing finish at Pocono International 
Raceway in Long Pond, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace outdueled Winston Cup point leader Ernie Irvan for the second week in 
a row and appeared to have the victory wrapped up before a late caution period 
threw the event into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Martin blew a tire on lap 194, bringing out the fifth and final yellow 
flag. That sent Wallace, who had been leading runner-up Earnhardt by more than 
21 seconds, and the other eight cars on the lead lap into the pits for one last 
tire change. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt's crew changed only right-side tires and got the defending series 
champion's Chevrolet Lumina back onto the 2.5-mile tri-oval in front of a 
surprised Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 There were still four laps remaining when they moved in behind the pace car, 
but NASCAR was forced to keep the race under caution while trying to sort out 
the scoring after Jeff Gordon spun and momentarily got stuck in the infield 
grass after coming back onto the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon got going and passed nearly the entire field under caution to move back 
into third, where he was when Martin's tire blew. 
</P>
<P>
 While Earnhardt and Wallace waited, NASCAR told his crew to send Gordon back 
to eighth place, but he remained third for the restart. NASCAR was expected to 
penalize Gordon and, although he crossed the finish line third, he was not 
listed among the top five in the final results. 
</P>
<P>
 The green flag waved with one lap remaining and Wallace's Ford immediately 
moved to the inside of the track and moved past Earnhardt in the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the fifth consecutive race, the powerful Penske team dominated Indy-car 
racing as Canadian Paul Tracy ran away from the rest of the field in the ITT 
Automotive Detroit Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy was clocked in 2 hours, 32 minutes and 29 seconds, 9.25 seconds ahead of 
teammate Emerson Fittipaldi and 4:13 better than Danny Sullivan's track record 
set last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr., who had won the three previous circuit races, was forced into a 
pile of tires after being brushed by Tracy's car with 40 laps to go and 
finished 10th.

WESTLAKE'S HIRSH LEADS MARMONTE LEAGUE ALL-STARS TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Marmonte League faced the Channel League in the Ventura County 
All-Star baseball game Sunday at Moorpark College, the two teams engaged in a 
home run-hitting contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were indicative of the game that followed.No player was able to 
clear the fence in the contest -- and, in the game, neither team got an 
extra-base hit. But the Marmonte League scored four runs in the sixth inning 
and held on for a 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Hirsh of Westlake had three hits, including a two-run single in the 
sixth that erased a 1-0 deficit. Kevin Sass of Agoura, who did not start, had 
two singles and was the only other player with more than one hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams went with their best pitchers early and that kept the hitting down 
for a while," Sass said. "Maybe I got a little lucky by coming in in the middle 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel League scored the first run in the fifth without a base hit. Sean 
Coker reached on a walk, advanced to second on a ground ball out, went to third 
on a wild pitch and scored on an error by Channel Islands shortstop Johnny 
Olivares. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Sanchez of Channel Islands, the third pitcher for the Marmonte League, 
gave up one run and no hits in two innings to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Kary Kozlowski pitched two innings and earned the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Moorpark's Jason Adamson had three hits as the Frontier League 
All-Stars routed seniors from the Tri-Valley League, 14-0.

SHOP TALK: IT'S BEST TO DISCUSS ISSUE OF PAY FAIRNESS WHEN HIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.

 Question: I would love to know what my colleagues -- those with the same job 
titles and years of experience -- are paid, but I don't know how to broach the 
subject. At my last job, a colleague once had occasion to peek at a pile of 
checks -- and she flipped. The men were paid considerably more than women doing 
the same job. The result was a swift and whopping pay increase for females. How 
can we ensure pay equity if talking about our salaries is taboo? 
</P>
<P>
 -- C.W., Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Equity or fairness of rewards is an important determinant of job 
satisfaction. It is also a very complex issue. Pay may be satisfying to an 
individual until he or she discovers that a co-worker with equivalent job 
performance, experience and education is receiving more pay. In deciding what 
level of pay is fair we consider what we contribute to the job and what we 
receive in return. But, we simultaneously compare our contributions and 
receipts to those of others. We are most satisfied when these ratios of 
contributions and receipts are equal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to understand that pay fairness does not mean pay equality. 
People holding the same job title may rightfully have different pay levels 
because of differences in training, performance ratings, seniority or 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Many organizations have a policy of pay secrecy, hoping that dissatisfaction 
arising from equity perceptions can be suppressed. Sometimes this policy can 
backfire in at least two ways. First, under conditions of pay secrecy employees 
tend to believe they are unfairly paid, even if the pay system is fair. Second, 
these same employees tend to underestimate the amount of pay their superiors 
are making. This perception may make promotion a less attractive incentive, and 
motivation to work hard for a promotion may be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 If talking to your co-workers about pay is taboo, you might tell your manager 
about your concerns regarding pay fairness. It is possible that a formal pay 
structure exists that your boss might share with you. I would not recommend 
that you secretly try to look into personnel files for this information. This 
action would be an invasion of the privacy of your co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues of pay fairness are best handled at the time you are hired. You should 
ask how pay grades are determined and what it takes to move from one grade to 
the next. A pay plan that is formally structured with explicit rules for 
getting additional pay is likely to be perceived as fair. If the pay plan of a 
prospective employer is not well structured and this bothers you, seek 
employment elsewhere. Alternatively, an unstructured pay system opens the door 
for pay to be based on persuasiveness or other social skills.

 Question: My company has recently changed its policy about overtime pay. The 
policy says if an employee's work hours in any week do not exceed 40 hours 
(except weeks with holidays), he or she will not be entitled to overtime pay. 
For example, if this week I take one day off or take one day as a sick day and 
I still work 40 hours, then I am entitled for my entire week pay plus eight 
hours of straight pay. Would you tell me whether its policy about overtime pay 
complies with labor law? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.J., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You are fortunate to work for a company that offers its employees sick 
pay, holidays and vacation benefits. There are some federal and state labor 
codes that partially regulate fringe benefits, but an employer has no 
obligation to offer employees such bonus days. Companies, however, usually do 
have established benefit policies or have contracts for their employees to 
remain competitive in hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 It is accepted practice to pay these extra days at the employee's regular 
straight time rate of pay. California's wage regulations (except Wage Order No. 
14, regarding agricultural occupations) require employers to pay overtime for 
hours actually worked in excess of eight hours a day or 40 hours in a work 
week. But these extra paid days, such as sick days, are not time worked, 
therefore the company policy appears to comply with labor regulations.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: THE PENULTIMATE WORKOUT; COLLECTIVE STAMINA HELPS IRVINE 
SOFTWARE COMPANY SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every day at 4:15 a.m., Paul Mondschein rises for his morning workout. First 
it's him against the stair-climbing machine, then he does about 2,500 sit ups. 
He faces even more punishment with free weights and Nautilus machines. 
Sometimes he plays squash. It's always about 90 minutes long. On weekends, its 
up to three to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He says rigorous exercise is the only thing that keeps him sane as chief 
executive of a start-up company, PenUltimate Inc., in the treacherous world of 
designing software for pen-based computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondschein and PenUltimate's 26 employees say it's their collective stamina 
that helps them survive in a business where the body count is high; the best 
known victim was Momenta Corp., a Silicon Valley company that lost $40 million 
before it collapsed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers staked their companies on widespread acceptance of pen technology, 
where a computer user enters computer data by placing a pen directly on the 
screen, thereby replacing the mouse and traditional keyboard. By now, the pen 
computing market was supposed to be $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology was billed as a more intuitive way of entering data into a 
computer. Some companies, like Momenta and Apple Computer Inc. with its widely 
criticized Newton, also tried to create computers that recognized handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mondschein, 45, says 3-year-old PenUltimate has survived because of its 
tenacity, its willingness to undergo mid-course corrections, and its foresight 
in relying on more than just pen computing. 
</P>
<P>
 As religiously as he pushes himself in his workouts, Mondschein works seven 
days a week. His favorite Latin slogan is " Nocte dieque incubando ," which 
translates to "by thinking about it day and night." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days we were pigeon-holed as another pen computing company," he 
said. "We tried a different approach. Pen was a technology, but mobile 
computing is a real market. Within that market, we decided to focus on . . . 
(making) the salesperson's job easier." 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate has become the only company pitching in-depth sales automation 
software to structure a traveling salesperson's life, according to an analysis 
by the Gartner Group, a market researcher in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Its software uses a pen mainly to take electronic notes, which can be stored 
in the computer and passed on to a sales manager. No handwriting recognition 
for translating writing into typewritten text is involved. And it can even run 
with a keyboard, instead of an electronic pen. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest selling point is the software's ability to analyze data and 
predict -- based on sales patterns from previous customers -- when a sale might 
close. For instance, at any given point in the sales cycle, the software 
predicts the odds of a successful sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their name starts with the word 'pen,' but I don't think of them as a 
pen-based computer company," said Thomas Betcher, an analyst for the Paulson 
Investment Co. in Portland. "They're serious about offering solutions to mobile 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondschein joined Larry Taylor, a software veteran who worked for Orange 
County's MAI Systems Corp., to start the company in August, 1991. Mondschein 
and Taylor raised $73,500 from family and friends; Mondschein's home serves as 
collateral for the four-year lease on the company's Irvine headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning, almost nothing has turned out the way they expected. 
Mondschein said he couldn't find any venture capitalists willing to take a risk 
with his fledgling company. He has since come to consider that a bit of luck, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dangerous thing for a young company is to have too much money," he 
said. "Momenta's mistake was having $40 million" in investor money. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate's initial software was created to run on what is now considered an 
obsolete software system. On Taylor's advice, the company switched after a few 
months to adapt its programs to run on what has become the surviving 
technology, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows for Pen operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also decided against selling a computing system to law enforcement 
agencies, so that police or sheriff's deputies, for example, could use the 
systems to automatically write traffic tickets. But it took too long for 
government agencies to decide whether to invest in the systems, so PenUltimate 
shelved that project. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the initial burst of pen technology was a nationwide bomb in the 
early 1990s. Among the few survivors are systems designed for delivery drivers, 
where pen computers are convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate raised $4 million in a public offering in December, which gave it 
the money to sell its main product, SalesForce. Its strategy has been to equip 
its own traveling salespeople with pen computers and the software, which 
organizes their sales pitches and simplifies communication with bosses. And 
last month, the company raised an additional $1.9 million in a private 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate has signed about a dozen contracts, but sales are a pittance so 
far. For the nine months ended March 31, the company reported revenue of 
$129,093, compared to zero sales the year before. The company lost $2.3 
million, compared to a loss of $883,171. On a per share basis, the loss was 
$1.76, compared to $1.13 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The future is still unsure, but Mondschein said he is confident because the 
company has a backlog of 1,600 copies of its software, which sells for $1,500 
to $2,500, depending on the size of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few months, the company will begin filling most of its initial 
orders. A five-month delay in the public offering, blamed on slow processing by 
the California Department of Corporations, set the firm back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul McBride, chief financial officer, estimates the company can break 
even in the quarter ending Sept. 30. By July, PenUltimate expects to supply up 
to 500 copies of its software to the IBM Personal Computer Co. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate hopes to benefit from the resuscitation of pen computing as a 
niche industry. The cost of pen technology has fallen and now the feature is 
marketed mainly as a supplement to a keyboard, not as a replacement. IBM's 
ThinkPad computers come with both keyboards and pens, selling for prices from 
$2,899 to $3,399. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Alfaro, program manager of pen computing at IBM, says his sales 
representatives love the PenUltimate software because it frees them from 
tedious report writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Miller Time comes around for the salesperson, the last thing they want 
to be stuck doing is writing reports to the boss," Mondschein said. "With our 
software, they just hit a button and the (handwritten) report is sent over the 
phone line to the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro also likes PenUltimate's SalesForce: Central version for managers 
because it gives him instant updates on sales forecasts for the coming quarter 
from all of his salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I have no way of telling exactly what is happening with the 
potential sales," Alfaro said. "Forecasting is where most sales organizations 
fall down and shoot in the dark."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE; YOUNG FIRM AIMS TO MAKE 
LEARNING A MULTIMEDIA ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly every week at Knowledge Adventure's nondescript headquarters in La 
Crescenta, the company's chairman and founder, Bill Gross, watches as a group 
of children compare his latest experiments in interactive educational software 
-- "Bug Adventure," say, or "The Discoverers" -- to video games like 
"Streetfighter II." 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly every week, he says, they like the video games better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make open-ended exploring as exciting as a regular old video game, 
and we're getting there -- I see glimmers of it from the kids who use our 
products," says the intense, bespectacled Gross. "But we have a long way to go 
to compete with MTV and 'Streetfighter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the glimmers were bright enough to attract the attention of 
Hollywood producer-director Steven Spielberg, who last week said he plans to 
develop multimedia software projects with Knowledge Adventure. He has also made 
an equity investment in the 3-year-old firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many multimedia investors, Spielberg is taking a flyer. Knowledge 
Adventure had sales of $18.5 million last year, but no profits. Yet the company 
is growing fast, with sales expected to reach $35 million this year, it says. 
Its crowded offices are bursting at the seams. Staff meetings are held in the 
hallway. The work is so intense that Gross often sleeps only a few hours a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of Knowledge Adventure's growing pains came in February, when Chief 
Executive Rod Turner resigned, citing a difference in visions for the company. 
Insiders said Turner wanted to take the company public sooner than Gross 
thought prudent. Gross says the company will go public eventually, but he won't 
say when. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than Spielberg's investment, to Knowledge Adventure, is what he 
can offer in prestige and creativity. Revered in high-tech circles as one of 
the few Hollywood types who understand how to blend entertainment and 
technology, Spielberg was courted by a range of companies involved in 
multimedia, from video game firms to software giant Microsoft Corp. That he 
chose Knowledge Adventure reflects the ascendance of interactive learning in a 
field long dominated by what are known in the industry as "twitch games." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg was not available for comment, but his business manager, Gerald 
Breslauer, did not rule out the possibility that he would make another 
multimedia investment as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the $6-billion-a-year video game business is where the 
multimedia money is. By contrast, American consumers bought about $400 million 
worth of educational computer programs last year. But multimedia analysts and 
an increasing number of entrepreneurs like Gross believe that learning is the 
most natural application of the new technology, which lets users jump around at 
will through reams of video, graphics, text and sounds stored on a shiny 
CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times earlier this year, Spielberg said he had no 
interest in producing "interactive movies" or video games, where players choose 
plot variations and different endings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bemoan the loss of control," he said. "It would be like making a film just 
to have everyone remake it over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 But the director -- known for his films "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial," 
"Jurassic Park" and "Schindler's List" -- spent hours playing Knowledge 
Adventure's CD-ROM "3-D Body Adventure" in the glass-walled conference room at 
his Amblin Entertainment production company a few months back. The program 
enables the user to fly around inside the heart chambers and arteries like a 
molecule traveling through the anatomy in a sort of multimedia "Fantastic 
Voyage." 
</P>
<P>
 "He played every single module!" recalls Larry Gross, vice president of 
customer satisfaction, who accompanied his older brother on the visit. "It was 
pretty fun to see my brother . . . knocking the socks off Steven Spielberg." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts the chemistry between Spielberg and Gross was key to the 
director's decision to work with privately held Knowledge Adventure, which just 
hired its 100th employee and boasts only about 4% of the educational software 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Gross likes Spielberg's films all right. But the self-described 
"total engineering nerd" was most impressed by the Hollywood mogul's fast-paced 
brainstorming on how to improve products like "Body Adventure." So far, the 
firm's CD-ROM titles -- including "Dinosaur Adventure," which came out by happy 
coincidence around the same time as Spielberg's dino-thriller "Jurassic Park," 
last summer -- have been more like multimedia reference tools than stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he took one look at 'Body Adventure' and said, 'That human body should 
walk on, look down, and notice he has no clothes on,' " Gross remembers. "We 
would never have thought of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nerd or not, Gross, 35, has some idea what it takes to run a successful 
business. Raised in Encino, he and his brother started out as a team at Portola 
Junior High, where they found they could buy candy bars in bulk for 4 cents 
each and resell them for 9 cents -- a penny less than the local candy store. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving on to Caltech, where the introduction of the first IBM personal 
computers changed their lives, the brothers started a firm called Gross 
National Products. They developed two programs that made the spreadsheet 
program Lotus 1-2-3 easier to use and accepted the firm's offer to acquire 
their start-up and employ them at Lotus' Cambridge, Mass., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 By the summer of 1991, Gross' son David was 4 years old and about to start 
kindergarten. Like all kids, he liked to imitate his dad, which mostly meant 
sitting at a computer and typing away. In his quest to find something more 
appropriate than business applications for David to play with, Gross came 
across a multimedia Beethoven CD-ROM (now available commercially from 
Microsoft). 
</P>
<P>
 "I had goose bumps all over my body about how great Beethoven was," Gross 
says. "It let me in on a non-academic way to discover beautiful things on my 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Gross founded Knowledge Adventure, collecting venture 
capital funding and investments from Paramount Communications Inc. (now a unit 
of Viacom Inc.) and AT&T along the way. But as part of the democratic culture 
he strives to instill, Gross has made sure more than half of the firm is owned 
by its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Knowledge Adventure is still losing money, its products have met with 
critical and commercial success, and it continues to churn out new ones. In the 
past few months, for example, the firm has shipped five new products, including 
an interactive version of the IMAX movie "The Discoverers," which producer 
Roger Holzberg describes as "30 minutes long and eight miles wide." 
</P>
<P>
 At the title's premier at the IMAX theater in Los Angeles, Knowledge Adventure 
invited previous customers to watch the movie and then play the interactive 
version on computers set up outside the auditorium. Michael Lamb, 13, thought 
it was pretty neat, though "Bug Adventure" remains his favorite: "The praying 
mantises are cool."

HOLLYWOOD ADDS BILLIONS TO STATE ECONOMY, NEW STUDIES REPORT; ENTERTAINMENT: 
THE INDUSTRY-COMMISSIONED REPORTS ALSO SAY IT CREATED MORE JOBS THAN HAD 
PREVIOUSLY BEEN ESTIMATED AND CONFIRM SIGNS THAT MORE PRODUCTION IS GOING 
ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood movie and television production pumped $16 billion into the state's 
economy in 1992 and created more jobs than previously estimated, at least 
according to two new studies paid for by the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the seven major studios still serve as the hub of industry activity, 
the studies found that the vast majority of feature films and TV programs are 
developed and produced by independent production companies, many employing 
fewer than 10 people, although many of these smaller firms work on a contract 
basis for the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, according to the narrower of the two studies -- which was conducted 
by Monitor Co., a Santa Monica management consulting firm -- the movie and TV 
industries directly employed 164,000 in California, of whom 95,000 were 
free-lancers, constituting a "mobile army" of skilled technicians, artists and 
craftspeople who go from project to project. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while California remains the leading supplier of entertainment to the 
world, the studies confirm signs that production is fleeing, an exodus the 
studies attribute to rising costs and difficulties in filming on location in 
Southern California. For instance, 95% of TV sitcoms -- which require little 
location shooting -- are filmed in California but only 40% of TV movies are 
shot in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic impact studies, which are scheduled to be released today, were 
commissioned by the Public Affairs Coalition of the Alliance of Motion Picture 
& Television Producers, which is composed of the major studios, two TV networks 
and many smaller companies. Not surprisingly, the studies tend to support the 
industry's assertion that it is a crucial contributor to the local economy and 
that it is composed mostly of small firms rather than rich and monolithic 
studios. Also implicit in them is the industry's criticism of the high costs 
and red tape associated with doing business in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies were able to tap internal employment and spending information from 
studios such as Universal, Warner Bros., Walt Disney, Paramount, Sony and 20th 
Century Fox, and from ABC and CBS. In addition, several large payroll companies 
were used for source material, as were various crafts guilds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monitor study examined data for 1992 (the latest available) and found: 
</P>
<P>
 * The motion picture, television and commercial production industry is one of 
the largest private-sector employers in the state, accounting for $16.3 billion 
in payroll and expenditures to suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles County, where much of "Hollywood" is, saw total industry 
expenditures of $15 billion. The figure for the city of Los Angeles was $8.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * The production of movies, TV and commercials directly employs more than 
164,000 people in California -- 40,000 to 60,000 more than previous estimates 
have said -- and indirectly employs another 184,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * This labor force includes 95,000 free-lance workers, who range from actors, 
directors and writers to painters, lighting technicians and sound boom 
operators. They are employed on a project-by-project basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * The average annual pay for all entertainment production industry employees, 
both full-time and free-lance, was $45,000; the average for all Californians is 
$29,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 1,000 California companies are involved in film and TV production 
in some way, but about 85% of these employ fewer than 10 people. 
</P>
<P>
 * The production industry generated total annual payroll of $7.4 billion and 
expenditures to suppliers of $8.9 billion, creating a major ripple effect in 
other sectors such as wardrobe companies, camera equipment firms, caterers, 
lumberyards, apparel retailers and florists. 
</P>
<P>
 * The major studios have earmarked more than $1 billion for future 
construction projects in the Los Angeles area alone. 
</P>
<P>
 These projects include a plan by 20th Century Fox to add studio and office 
space to its Pico Boulevard lot; Warner Bros.' $100-million expansion of its 
Burbank lot and plans for a $200-million expansion of its West Hollywood lot; 
Walt Disney's plans for a $600-million expansion of its Burbank lot; Sony 
Pictures Entertainment's plans for a $100-million expansion in Culver City; 
Paramount Pictures plans to build additional facilities in Hollywood, and MCA's 
spending $140 million for construction in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 The second study, by economist David Friedman, drew on broader sources to 
estimate that, with its economic multiplier effect, entertainment industry 
employment in California totaled 534,000 jobs.

U.S. DIPLOMATS TURN EFFORTS TO BOOSTING TRADE; COMMERCE: TOURING AMBASSADORS 
URGE AMERICAN BUSINESS PEOPLE TO INVEST IN THE BOOMING ECONOMIES OF SOUTHEAST 
ASIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A T-shirt noticed recently in Singapore by Steve Craven, senior commercial 
officer at the U.S. Embassy, seemed to sum up a prevailing value in that 
trade-rich city-state. Starting with big letters at the top and repeating in 
descending rows of smaller and smaller type, it declared: "MONEY, money, money, 
money, money . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the importance of money is one of the few things the American 
government and its increasingly assertive Asian trading partners can agree 
about these days, after the debacle of Washington's human rights standoff with 
Beijing and the caning of an American youth accused of vandalism in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration says trade and human rights are now officially 
de-linked, and with security issues on the back burner after the end of the 
Cold War, the U.S. diplomatic corps in Asia is redefining itself as a 
cheerleader for American businesses. Economic security, with an emphasis on 
American jobs generated by exports, is at the forefront of U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore that point, a band of American ambassadors and their top 
commercial aides are touring major U.S. cities, spreading the gospel of trade 
and investment in the booming economies of Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Their message, delivered to a ballroom full of business people at a downtown 
Los Angeles hotel last week, was loud and clear: To take advantage of the 
lucrative opportunities in Asia, you have to go there, establish a presence in 
a challenging business environment and patiently build relationships over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are opportunities out there, but you're not going to be able to exploit 
them by using a fax machine or hiring an agent," said Robert Barry, ambassador 
to Indonesia, which not many Americans realize is the planet's 
fourth-most-populous country. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a perception basis, Indonesia is the most underestimated country in the 
world," Barry said. "But there are too few American companies going there and 
looking seriously at this market of 190 million people." 
</P>
<P>
 The touring diplomats come from the capitals of the six-member Assn. of 
Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, a group consisting of Indonesia, Thailand, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and the tiny oil sultanate of Brunei. They 
are scheduled to appear in Seattle today, then travel to Denver, St. Louis and 
New York in a program organized by the Washington-based U.S.-ASEAN Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotional blitz, being repeated for the third year, is aimed primarily 
at small and medium-size U.S. firms -- on the assumption that while many major 
U.S. corporations are already well placed in Asia, smaller companies have been 
complacent and lack savvy about how to tap into the region's phenomenal 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opportunities don't come to you, you've got to take the initiative," said 
John Wolf, ambassador to Malaysia. "If you wait to read about a (procurement) 
tender offer, it's too late. You're going to find your competitor is already in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the ambassadors' effort goes to changing the image of American 
embassies abroad, from foreboding high-security bunkers to business-friendly 
service centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jakarta, the Indonesian capital where President Clinton is expected to 
attend a summit of Asian leaders in November, the U.S. commercial service is 
creating a "one-stop shop" -- outside the gates of the embassy compound -- to 
serve U.S. business visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the developing economies of Southeast Asia are dwarfed by major U.S. 
trade partners in Asia -- such as Japan, China and South Korea -- they boast 
some of the most dynamic growth rates in the world. Last year Singapore's 
economy grew by 9.7% and Malaysia's by 8.4%; ASEAN's combined average growth is 
7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the next five years, the economies of Southeast Asia will generate more 
economic growth than the entire Mexican GNP," said Ralph Boyce, U.S. charge 
d'affaires in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 ASEAN, with a total population of 328 million, is the third-largest overseas 
market for U.S. exports, after Japan and the European Union, buying more than 
$28 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to the U.S.-ASEAN Council. 
California alone exported more than $8 billion worth of goods to ASEAN -- 
including $5.3 billion in computers, machinery and electronic goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Philippines, the laggard of ASEAN, now has political stability and 
offers opportunity for U.S. investors and exporters, said John Negraponte, 
ambassador to Manila. "It's not certainly going to become a tiger, or a tiger 
cub, right away," Negraponte said. "But the Philippines is on the move and 
should be taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to success in any Asian market, the diplomats agreed, is building 
relationships with local partners, and making a commitment to a marketplace 
that probably won't yield immediate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Indonesian partner has got to be comfortable with you," said Ted 
Villinski, senior commercial officer in Jakarta. "Having the right product at 
the lowest price is not sufficient. It takes patience. You have to develop that 
personal relationship and you have to be there physically in the country."

 What's in store for John Garamendi now that he has lost his bid for the 
Democratic gubernatorial nomination and his term as insurance commissioner will 
be up soon? 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Garamendi says there is no word yet on what the onetime 
rancher and banker plans to do. In any event, Garamendi has had plenty of job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Garamendi, eager to project an image as a friend of 
workers, performed a variety of odd jobs in each county in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Would any of his employers-for-a-day consider taking him back? Here's what 
some said: 
</P>
<P>
 * Brad LeDuc said he'd be eager to hire Garamendi for the $6-an-hour job 
pumping gas at the Mariposa Chevron station he owns with his brothers. 
Garamendi spent a day there back in February fueling cars and packing wheel 
bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a heck of a lot of better than most of the people here," LeDuc said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Likewise, Garamendi would have no problem landing the $5.25-an-hour job at 
Manor Market in Bishop, where he manned the cash register and stocked 
merchandise, and where he was found to be "very personable." 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Dana Point Hilton, Garamendi would be welcome to return as a 
$6.50-an-hour front-desk clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He picked up things pretty quickly," said Julienne Etzel, director of front 
office operations, said of his stint there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fred Hodges, chief executive of Chico Community Hospital, said: "Mr. 
Garamendi would bring great expertise to our insurance billing department." Not 
Looking to Strike Out 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlings Sporting Goods, probably best known for supplying major league 
baseball players with equipment, hopes to overcome some past errors and become 
a hit through an initial public stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis company is being divested by ailing Figgie International. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a liquidity crunch at Figgie, Rawlings had to limit production and 
even cancel orders, according to documents filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the details contained in the SEC papers is the fact that Rawlings 
developed the original deep-pocket baseball glove back in 1920 in consultation 
with Bill Doak, "a spitball-throwing southpaw with the St. Louis Cardinals." 
Friendly Reminder 
</P>
<P>
 CBS can't seem to get away from reminders of Fox's recent raid of eight of its 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 A Women in Film awards lunch Friday in Beverly Hills featured a program guide 
with ads congratulating recipients, including one from CBS. On the opposite 
page was a similar ad from New World Communications, which owns the eight 
stations fleeing CBS for Fox. Briefly . . .

 According to Austin, Minn.-based George Hormel & Co., Spam's maker, 100 
million pounds of Spam are sold each year. The average consumers are families 
with several children. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sales of Spam were flat in the 1970s and '80s, the product resurged 
recently. In the 1950s, it was known as the "Meat of 1,000 Uses." 
</P>
<P>
 Hormel plays the product's curious cachet to the hilt with events such as a 
Spam Jamboree each year in Austin, Minn., and a Spam cook-off in Hawaii, which 
has the highest per-capita consumption of the canned meat.

 Fairchild Settles Testing Claims: Fairchild Corp. agreed to pay the government 
$330,000 to settle claims it sold untested or improperly tested aerospace 
fasteners to the military, the Justice Department said.The deficient testing 
occurred at plants in Santa Ana, Torrance and New Jersey. Fairchild, based in 
Chantilly, Va., told the Defense Department about the fasteners in 1990; there 
were no reports that any failed. The settlement is not related to Fairchild's 
payment of $18 million in criminal fines and civil penalties in 1991, after it 
pleaded guilty to charges that workers at its Voi-Shan plant in Chatsworth 
falsified and omitted test results for aerospace nuts and bolts.

Andover and Lowell, Mass., a spokesman said. The Lowell facility is being 
closed. A total of 796 workers will be laid off in the missile systems

 Ford Plans Safety Software for Electric Vehicle: The auto maker said it will 
install the computer software on its Ecostar minivans to detect conditions that 
could lead to a battery fire.Should such conditions be detected, the vehicle's 
sodium-sulfur battery would be deactivated. Ford Motor Co. had asked test 
participants to stop using the vehicles until it completed an investigation of 
recent battery fires. Development of the software should keep the 34 test 
vehicles off the road for about 10 weeks. The vans are leased -- for about 
$100,000 each -- only for corporate fleets.

BOEING 777 MAKES ITS FIRST FLIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Boeing Co.'s 777 jet took off Sunday on its first flight, launching an 
ambitious testing program for the manufacturer's latest model. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's largest twin-engine jet took off for its test flight from a runway 
near the huge manufacturing plant here where the plane is assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, which represents Boeing's riskiest venture since the jumbo 747 jet 
of the mid-1960s, had a payload of nearly 40,000 pounds of equipment. A T-33 
military training plane that shadowed the craft was dwarfed by it. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-knot tail wind caused some concern and delayed takeoff by 45 minutes, but 
finally the pilot and co-pilot -- the only two people aboard -- decided to 
follow the original flight plan and took off to the north for a flight that 
lasted three hours and 48 minutes, most of it over water. 
</P>
<P>
 The 777, scheduled to be delivered next May to its launch customer, United 
Airlines, is intended to fill a gap in Boeing's product line and compete 
against jets made by Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp.

2 BLACK-OWNED LAW FIRMS PLAN TO ANNOUNCE MERGER; PARTNERSHIPS: MCGEE WILLIS & 
GREENE AND ARNELLE & HASTIE WILL TEAM UP. BOTH CATER TO BLUE-CHIP CORPORATE 
CLIENTS.

<P>
 Two of the West Coast's largest minority-owned law firms, San Francisco-based 
McGee Willis & Greene and Arnelle & Hastie, plan to announce today that they 
intend to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 The two black-owned firms have a total of 35 lawyers and offices in Los 
Angeles, New York and other cities.The announcement of their merger plans comes 
a few months after both lost several partners, staff members and clients. The 
combination of the firms, which will be known as Arnelle Hastie McGee Willis & 
Greene, is expected to be completed by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can now go to clients . . . with a broader level of expertise and more 
depth with regard to our resources," said managing partner Otis McGee Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee and Arnelle are among the few minority-owned law firms that have catered 
to blue-chip corporate clients. The McGee firm specializes in such areas as 
business litigation, product liability and labor. Arnelle has focused on 
litigation well as on banking and real estate issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But both firms have recently lost several staff members and clients. In May, 
Arnelle partner Bill Lofton and five lawyers left the firm to form a new 
practice specializing in public finance. 
</P>
<P>
 At McGee, partner Gary Lafayette and two other lawyers also left in May to 
form a small litigation firm. The three took with them clients Eastman Kodak 
and Procter & Gamble, Lafayette said. "We left on good terms," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said the firms' merger, which had been contemplated for several years, 
was not driven by the recent staff departures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing just seemed very right," he said.

WEST COAST AGENCIES PICK UP TOP CLIO AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Milk got it. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Got Milk?" commercial featuring a historian trying to talk with his mouth 
full of peanut butter won one of the most coveted awards in advertising 
Saturday night -- the Clio Award for the best television commercial of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And the complete ad campaign for Apple PowerBook, which features diverse 
people who use the same personal computer for a variety of reasons, won the 
Clio Award for the best multimedia ad campaign of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the big winners were created by West Coast ad agencies: the California 
Milk Processor Board ad by the San Francisco agency Goodby, Silverstein & 
Partners, and the Apple ads by the Los Angeles office of BBDO Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes of the ad world were focused on the West Coast over the weekend, as 
the 35th Annual Clio Awards ceremony snubbed New York City for the first time 
and held the "Oscars of Advertising" ceremony in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clio Awards -- if not Madison Avenue -- the event represented a 
substantial step back toward respectability. Its image was severely strained 
three years ago in New York City when disappointed ad executives stormed a 
stage to grab Clio statuettes after a botched Clio ceremony was halted. 
Ownership of the Clio Awards has since changed hands twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad entries and attendance were up considerably this year. And ad executives 
say that the Clio Awards wisely gave an overdue nod to ad creativity by hosting 
the ceremony in a city generally regarded as the current focal point of the 
nation's best advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the country's creative hotbed," said Jim Smyth, executive director 
and owner of the Clio Awards, who noted that the ceremony will return to San 
Francisco next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California TV viewers are very familiar with the "Got Milk?" ads, few 
others are. It is a regional campaign rarely seen out of state. While the 
campaign always shows humorous examples of people running out of milk at just 
the wrong time, the reason behind it is very serious: Milk consumption in the 
state has dropped 17% since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Goodby, creative director, said the ads simply try to be honest about the 
occasions when people drink milk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could make ads until we're blue in the face, but not many people are going 
to come in from jogging on a hot day and drink a tall glass of milk," Goodby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big West Coast winner, BBDO/Los Angeles, won a Clio for its combined 
TV, print and billboard campaign for Apple Computer's PowerBook.  
</P>
<P>
 Each ad asks: "What's on your PowerBook?" Celebrities who are polar opposites 
list their reasons for using the same personal computer. "The only thing the 
people in them have in common is their PowerBooks," said Steve Hayden, chairman 
of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this summer, Fox Network plans to run a TV special featuring the winning 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny Boston agency, Doyle Advertising & Design, picked up an impressive 11 
Clios -- including nine for a public service print campaign for the National 
Assn. of Atomic Veterans, a group of veterans who developed cancer after post 
World War II atomic tests.

 Dow Corning Cites Bankruptcy Option: The company might consider filing for 
Bankruptcy Court protection should too many women opt out of a proposed 
$4-billion settlement of silicone breast-implant liability cases, a spokesman 
said.That scenario is unlikely, the spokesman said, because the Midland, Mich., 
company is in good financial health and most women involved in the class-action 
suits will accept the deal. Plaintiffs have until June 17 to accept the deal or 
decide to pursue their own cases. The settlement covers Dow Corning Corp. and 
other manufacturers of the implants, which were used by millions of women.

 Pepsi Offends Church of England: Pepsi-Cola became the third big U.S. brand 
name in a week to find its marketing tactics clashing with religion after the 
company beamed its logo onto the biggest cathedral in Britain.Coca-Cola and 
McDonald's had offended Muslims with World Cup promotions that included sacred 
scripture from the Koran. After Pepsi's name appeared Wednesday night on the 
tower of the Anglican cathedral in Liverpool, the cathedral's dean said he was 
astounded. The Rev. Derrick Walters said he doubted that the world's No. 2 
soft-drink maker would project its image onto important buildings in the United 
States. A Pepsi spokesman in London said he had mailed apologies to the dean 
and church attorneys.

 Kidder Probe Expands: A Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. executive who supervised 
Joseph Jett, the bond trader fired for allegedly creating false profits that 
cost the firm millions, is being investigated about his possible involvement, a 
published report said.The Wall Street Journal said Melvin R. Mullin, head of 
Kidder's derivatives operations, is under investigation by an internal 
committee looking into the Jett affair. Kidder fired Jett in April, charging 
him with having created $350 million in phony profits from government bond 
trades to hide actual losses and to raise his pay. The Journal said Mullin, who 
hired Jett in 1991 and was Jett's immediate supervisor until early 1993, is 
being questioned about whether he knew of the alleged scam.

 Trade Deficit Narrows: A surge in exports reduced the trade deficit for the 
first five months of the year to $1.79 billion from $3.07 billion a year 
earlier, major Chinese newspapers reported Friday. Exports during the period 
soared 24.1% to $37.49 billion, and imports rose 18.1% to $39.28 billion, the 
official China Daily said, citing a Customs Administration report. By the end 
of May, the deficit was $1.27 billion less at than at that point last year, the 
paper said.

 Government to Begin Releasing Data on Service Trade: The Finance Ministry will 
by late 1995 begin releasing data on the country's service trade as part of the 
current account figures included in official international balance of trade 
statistics, Japan's Jiji Press reported. Based on a formula the International 
Monetary Fund adopted last year, the new account figures will track trade in 
sectors such as construction, finance, insurance, transportation and travel. 
The ministry may also divide payments data into capital and current account 
balances, Jiji said.

 Trade Totals Rise in April: Total trade grew 19.6% to $16.9 billion in April 
from $14.3 billion for that month last year, according to the Singapore Trade 
Development Board.Total trade volume grew 13% in April, based on a three-month 
moving average. Volume of imports rose 10.6%, and volume of exports rose 15.6%. 
Non-oil domestic exports -- led by higher demand for computer chips, disk 
drives, microcomputers and other goods -- grew 16.7% in volume. Re-exports grew 
17.5%. Weak oil prices pushed the value of exported oil down 13.4%, although 
volume rose 8%.

 Government Considering Privatization: The country will move swiftly to create 
capital markets to attract desperately needed domestic and foreign investment 
for economic development, State Monetary & Financial Council Minister Phan Van 
Tiem told delegates at a Euromoney conference in Hanoi Friday. Much of 
Vietnam's domestic industry is controlled by the state, but the government is 
considering plans to sell state industries to private investors.Tiem said 10 
state enterprises have applied to privatize. Vietnam Airlines, for example, is 
awaiting government approval to sell a 30% equity stake to a foreign partner to 
raise funds to expand. Analysts consider other enterprises such as Hanoi 
Tourism and Saigon Tourism, which own most of the hotels in Vietnam, and the 
state-owned PetroVietnam oil company to be prime candidates for listing on a 
stock exchange.

TOBACCO FIRMS FUMING OVER IMPORT SUSPENSION; TRADE: CHINA TAKES THE ACTION 
AFTER NEW POLICIES EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE FOREIGN CIGARETTES' RETAIL PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 China recently introduced new tax and tariff policies retroactive from Jan. 1 
that effectively double the retail price of legally imported cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has led to a suspension of imports by the China National Tobacco 
Import & Export Corp. (CNTIEC), the country's sole legal importer of 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CNTIEC suspended imports because of the high duties that were imposed," 
said Colin Goddard, regional manager for corporate affairs at Philip Morris 
Asia Inc., the Hong Kong-based arm of the U.S. food, beer and tobacco company. 
"They considered there would be little demand for imports when their price 
doubled under the new tax structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Hit particularly hard are companies such as Philip Morris and BAT Industries, 
which have yet to conclude agreements to manufacture in China. At stake is 
access to a market of 1.72 trillion cigarettes a year, or 30% of world 
consumption. Further, it is an expanding market: It is expected to hit 1.96 
trillion by the year 2000, according to a recent estimate by the Euromonitor 
market research firm in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in duties on luxury goods and the imposition of consumption and 
value-added taxes put the total tax imposed on foreign cigarettes to 432% of 
the import price; it was 175% before. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax rise could make nonsense of China's pledge in a October, 1992, 
memorandum of understanding with the United States to remove all 
import-licensing requirements for tobacco products by the end of 1994. Those 
requirements have restricted foreign tobacco companies to less than 1% of 
China's legal cigarette market. The tax rise may also hinder China's efforts to 
enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), tobacco company 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Goddard said that the CNTIEC and the China National Tobacco Corp. (CNTC), the 
state-controlled cigarette monopoly that operates nearly 150 plants across the 
country, have sought a change in the tax system. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fletcher, Rothmans of Pall Mall Asia public affairs director, said he 
did not think China had sought to hurt the foreign tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said that even should the licensing requirements end on Dec. 31, that 
would not signal a complete opening in China's cigarette market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't open up on a Taiwan kind of scale," Fletcher said, reference to the 
increase in foreign firms' proportion of the Taiwan market to 17% in 1987 from 
1% before Taiwan opened its market. 
</P>
<P>
 Even leading anti-smoking campaigner Dr. Judith Mackay says the new tax system 
appears to be a strategy that cannot last for long, given the trade pressures. 
Mackay, a senior adviser to the Chinese Assn. on Smoking and Health (CASH), 
says higher taxes will exacerbate China's smuggling problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris recently signed an agreement for the production of Red and White 
cigarettes in eastern China to be exported to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract is part of an umbrella agreement the company reached last August 
with CNTC. That agreement provides the basis for the CNTC to produce and sell 
Marlboro cigarettes in China and for the two companies to develop and produce 
other brands to be sold in China and elsewhere.

 Unemployment Rate Falls to 9.8%: The figures for May, released last week, hit 
9.8%, the lowest level since August, 1991.The April rate was 10.1%. Employment 
rose a hefty 30,500 jobs, contrasted with a 5,800 increase in April. Analysts 
welcomed the data but warned that the central bank will have to raise interest 
rates if inflation is driven up by such strong employment growth.

HOT JOBS: WELFARE ELIGIBILITY WORKER 'HELPS PEOPLE GET SETTLED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Khanh Ha immigrated to the United States from Vietnam 12 years ago, she 
already spoke some English and, eventually, she was able to find a job as a 
receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
 She took classes to improve her English and began working as a dental 
assistant. But she remembered what it was like to arrive in a strange country, 
with only a few relatives to help her adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started doing everything I could to help Vietnamese refugees," said Ha, 42. 
A friend suggested that she apply for a job as a welfare eligibility worker 
with the Orange County Social Services Agency. "I applied, passed the test and 
got the job. It's a good job. I help people get settled." 
</P>
<P>
 As an eligibility worker, Ha interviews applicants who apply for assistance. 
She goes over the paperwork with them and makes sure they understand which 
documents are required to complete the application. After verifying the 
information, she determines the programs for which they are eligible, including 
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medi-Cal benefits and 
refugee assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I get as many as five new cases per day," Ha said. "There is a lot 
of checking to do, to make sure the information is correct and that the 
applicants comply with all the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally Ha must inform applicants that they are not eligible for 
benefits. "That's the hard part," she said. "All I can do is make sure they 
understand the process. The important thing is to treat them fairly." 
OCCUPATION: Welfare eligibility worker 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Welfare eligibility workers interview those applying for 
food stamps, medical benefits and other forms of assistance from the county's 
Social Services Agency. They explain the application process and the need for 
any additional documentation that may be required. After verifying information 
from the applicant, the eligibility worker determines which forms of assistance 
the applicant is eligible to receive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Minimum qualifications include the completion of 30 units of 
college-level work in a human services or social science field; or two years of 
office services experience with a background in financial record keeping or 
interviewing; or the completion of a county-approved training program. Other 
necessary skills include the ability to gather, record and evaluate data; 
organize, prioritize and process large volumes of paperwork, and perform 
arithmetic computations. Bilingual ability, particularly Spanish or Vietnamese, 
is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: One of the 10 fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of welfare eligibility workers is projected to 
increase by 14.4% to 1,590 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $1,810 to $2,399 per month. Those assigned to bilingual 
caseloads receive an additional 60 cents per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Welfare eligibility workers report strong satisfaction from helping 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: The eligibility worker is the main point of contact with applicants 
who are frustrated by their living conditions or from dealing with numerous 
assistance agencies. They often encounter individuals who are angry or have 
lost hope in improving their situations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Experienced welfare eligibility workers may become unit 
supervisors and advance further into administrative levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I would encourage anyone who is bilingual to apply, since their 
skills are very badly needed here." -- Khanh Ha, eligibility worker, Orange 
County Social Services Agency

NORTHWEST CUTS U.S. FARES TO LURE SUMMER VACATIONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northwest Airlines Corp. said it is lowering fares for domestic flights by up 
to 35%, a move targeted at summer vacation travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale fares are good for travel July 3 through Sept. 12, and must be 
purchased by Friday, the carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not too late to get a great bargain on summer vacation travel, but you 
have to act fast," said Tim Griffin, senior vice president at Minneapolis-based 
Northwest. "These will be the best prices for the remainder of the summer 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest's sale includes discounted fares to cities in the 48 contiguous 
United States, Hawaii and Canada, as well as Montego Bay, Jamaica; Cancun, 
Mexico, and Grand Cayman. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers can fly round-trip between Los Angeles and Boston for $398, 
normally $674; between New York and Phoenix for $364, discounted from $560; and 
between Hartford, Conn., and Denver for $385, normally $592. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts come amid a wave of fare reductions for foreign travel by major 
carriers. American Airlines Inc. said last week it was matching some European 
fare discounts initiated by Trans World Airlines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA announced the discounts last Monday and some carriers matched its fares.

 PLAYING THE ANGLES: In the race to succeed outgoing Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell of Maine, California's Democratic senators have taken 
different roads -- reflecting their respective political circumstances. Sen. 
Barbara Boxer wasted no time jumping on the bandwagon of Sen. Jim Sasser 
(D-Tenn.), who chairs the Budget Committee on which Boxer sits. She is among a 
handful of senators plotting strategy for Sasser's battle with Sen. Tom Daschle 
(D-S.D.). Boxer figures to win Sasser's gratitude -- presumably measured in 
support for her legislation, committee assignments and other chits -- whether 
he becomes the Senate leader or remains Budget Committee chairman. . . . Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, meanwhile, has remained on the sidelines -- pending her 
reelection bid. Hoping to win her vote when the Senate leadership election is 
held next year, Sasser and Daschle both are expected to help raise money for 
Feinstein this fall.

 TOBACCO WARS: Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler has 
taken his anti-smoking campaign to a new, more personal level. Knowing that 
most of the nation's 48 million smokers got hooked in their youth, he appeared 
last week before his daughter's sixth-grade English class to lecture on the 
dangers of cigarettes. Perhaps convinced, the students have proposed a 
commercial, featuring pieces of fruit shunning a smoking apple, that they plan 
to submit to Kessler for use in a future FDA campaign.

 IMAGE CONSCIOUS: Former Democratic Party Chairman Robert S. Strauss says 
President Clinton's aides have been missing a chance to boost their boss's 
image. Strauss told reporters that whenever President George Bush was 
photographed playing golf, he made certain Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III or National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft was in the shot too -- making 
it appear they were conferring on official business. "You never see that with 
Clinton when he's playing golf," Strauss said.

 NOT READY FOR CRIME TIME: Efforts to produce a final anti-crime bill are hung 
up in a House-Senate negotiating committee. Insiders say that's because crusty 
Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) is dragging his boot heels, hoping to keep an assault 
weapon ban out of the final product. The Senate included the ban in its version 
of the bill, and the House passed separate legislation over Brooks' objections. 
Lawmakers had hoped to have the bill to Clinton by the Memorial Day recess. 
Now, it may not be born until the Fourth of July.

 SILENCE IS GOLDEN: Officials say National Security Council aide Jenonne Walker

ambassador in Prague, capital of the Czech Republic. Walker, a former foreign 
service officer, publicly called for U.S. military intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1992, when she was a leading Democratic critic of Bush's 
policy on the former Yugoslavia. Since joining the NSC last year, she has 
refused to say whether she still holds that view.

 H. ROSS RENO? Perhaps a secret student of chart-happy billionaire Ross Perot, 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has taken to using visual aids in her briefing sessions. 
Last week, she sat behind a basket filled with plastic picnic ware to announce 
a legal attack by the Justice Department on an alleged price-fixing scheme in 
the multimillion-dollar disposable dinnerware industry. "I have always been a 
little bit reluctant to do visual things," she said. "But I am amazed at how 
people pick up on this."

STREET SMART: A FORTUNATE FEW DISCOVER THAT TRAFFIC COURT IS JUST THE TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't the money, Donald Gadsden insisted, it was the principle. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not run a stop sign one morning in February on his way to work, he 
said, and he'd come to traffic court Downtown to confront the police officer 
who claimed he did and issued him a $178 ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with a certain anxiety that Gadsden did this. He knew the old 
I-didn't-do-it defense usually falls on deaf ears. But as it turned out, he 
never had to sing that refrain. His case was dismissed when the officer failed 
to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus did Gadsden, a 42-year-old attorney for CBS, become one of the thousands 
of motorists each year in Los Angeles County who challenge their tickets -- and 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected to lose," Gadsden confided afterward, his 26-year clean driving 
record kept intact by the officer's absence. "But I wanted to, if nothing else, 
tell my story." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of others feel the same way, but not all enjoy the same success. In 
fact, be warned that the numbers aren't in your favor if you're thinking of 
taking on the justice system over a moving violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 13,779 traffic infractions that went to trial last year in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court, only 3,049 were thrown out -- fewer than 1 in 4. Plus, by 
opting for a court appearance, you forfeit the right to attend traffic school, 
which may not be the most stimulating way to spend a Saturday but keeps your 
record clear and your insurance premiums lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's why half of the 533,478 people cited last year for everything 
from speeding to honking their horns unnecessarily take the path of least 
resistance and pony up the fine through the mail -- in effect admitting guilt. 
(The others plead guilty during a court arraignment or have their tickets 
tossed out before trial for one reason or another.) 
</P>
<P>
 For others, however, battling the ticket becomes a small legal crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case one recent afternoon of the City of Los Angeles vs. James 
Ray, a Glendale broadcast engineer who came to court accused of whipping along 
Forest Lawn Drive at 68 m.p.h., well in excess of the 45-m.p.h. limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, an electronics buff, argued that the police officer's radar gave a false 
reading. Did the officer know, Ray asked during cross-examination, that the 
fence along Forest Lawn Drive has metal spikes running along the top, and that 
those spikes could alter the reading of the radar? 
</P>
<P>
 As his trump card, Ray produced Exhibit A, a hand-held video camera containing 
footage of those very spikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a video monitor here, I can feed it through," he said helpfully 
in a courtroom where a cushioned seat would have been the height of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, sure we do," Traffic Commissioner Allan Lasher replied in sarcastic 
amusement. "I'm getting cable next." 
</P>
<P>
 Making do, Lasher squinted through the camera's viewfinder to watch the tape. 
He listened to Ray explain the foibles of radar waves. And then he pronounced 
Ray guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the defendant couldn't hide his disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed if I came in and defended it honestly, I'd be relieved of being 
found guilty," said Ray, 46, who had posted -- and now lost -- $136 in bail. 
"So now I have a blemish on my record. My first." 
</P>
<P>
 His trial lasted an uncommonly long 20 minutes. Most of the cases that 
afternoon were adjudicated in less than half that time, including a woman who 
persuaded the commissioner that the real recipient of her ticket was her 
sister, who liked to use her identity and was in fact in jail under her name at 
that very moment. 
</P>
<P>
 In eight of the cases -- about half of the total -- the defendants won by 
default because the ticketing officer didn't show up. Gamely, Lasher offered 
each person the chance to come another day and argue the case on its own merits 
for a more satisfying triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 No one took up his offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just wimp out," 25-year-old Emanuel Jones of Los Angeles said, loath to 
explain why he was clocked at twice the speed limit in a 35-m.p.h. zone. 
"Forget the thrill of victory." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Banking on the absence of an officer at the trial is risky business. The 50% 
absentee rate on the afternoon described here seemed a little higher than usual 
to Lee Rittenburg, a lawyer with Traffic Defenders in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 By his informal count during his days in court, Rittenburg estimates that 
officers fail to appear 20% to 30% of the time. But there are ways to increase 
your chances, Rittenburg said, such as requesting well in advance of the trial 
that it be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage to this is that the officer's memory might dim by the time you 
come to trial," Rittenburg said. "Also, it's possible that the officer could be 
transferred to another division, making his appearance on your ticket more 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic attorneys also know of other ways to improve your chances of an 
acquittal, such as demanding a copy of the officer's notes (to which you are 
entitled) or asking for the trial to take place in Downtown Los Angeles, the 
county seat, even if the ticket was issued in a distant city, like Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But such legal expertise does not come cheaply, which is probably why the 
overwhelming majority of motorists who fight their tickets in court do so the 
same way they drive: solo. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worked twice in two months for Regina Davenport of Pacoima, who 
successfully contested a ticket in Newhall in May and then another in Los 
Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more recent incident, Davenport contended that the very officer who had 
cited her for impeding traffic in a parking lot was in her way -- the cause of 
her stopping her car in the first place. To make her point, she submitted to 
the court an extensive diagram, which Lasher described as "suitable for 
framing" before dismissing the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'I know the truth and he knows the truth, but by him being 
the officer, they would probably believe him,' " Davenport said, visibly 
relieved that she had escaped car insurance purgatory for the second time in 
such a short period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it doesn't happen again."

STREISAND ITEMS DON'T GO FOR A SONG; AUCTION: FANS PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR 
SOME OF THE SINGER'S HOUSEHOLD GOODS IN A KIND OF HIGH-CLASS GARAGE SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Griffin, a very serious Streisand fan, was a few minutes too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she gotten to the auction house just a hair earlier Sunday morning, had 
she registered a few minutes sooner, she would have been able to bid on Barbra 
Streisand's Art Deco decanter. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the item she had really wanted, but it was first on the list and was 
sold before she could take her seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she went away empty-handed from this auction of trinkets from 
Streisand's Malibu homes. She paid $225 for a Streisand clock and $350 for a 
small red Streisand tray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nuts," said Griffin, who flew down from the San Francisco Bay Area just 
for this auction. "The trip was definitely worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin has been doing a lot of traveling -- and spending -- these days in the 
name of Streisand. She has been to two of Streisand's long-awaited concerts and 
will be flying to New York for a third and to Anaheim for a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a real fan," she said in a bit of understatement. "For women, she just 
signifies that you can have it all. She got where she is with guts and raw 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Such were the people who showed up Sunday morning at A. N. Abell's Auction Co. 
in Commerce to have a look at what Streisand was selling off. It was a kind of 
high-class garage sale, odds and ends from the four Malibu houses the famed 
singer and actress has donated to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, for instance, the green mink vest and stork bookends and an 
electric hot fudge container and a toaster. There were vases and pitchers and 
even five tobacco pipes, more than 100 items in all that Streisand is selling. 
(An old Philco radio had been on sale as well, but Streisand called before the 
auction began to say she didn't want to sell it after all.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to sell her things quick, before she changes her mind," said 
auctioneer Bob Abell. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Abell got right to work, starting with 11 Streisand items before moving 
on to other, pricier things that were also being sold from other estates. Then 
he would return to more items marked "Streisand" in the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear that having the Streisand name attached to them made people 
outrageously inflate their bids. Take, for instance, the pipes that went for 
$175, or the chrome toaster that sold for $90. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I've been in this business for almost 50 years, and I can tell you 
that I have never sold a toaster for $90," said Abell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fabrizi, a non-fan, was standing outside smoking a cigarette soon after 
the toaster sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can come here any other time and find the exact same thing, but at a 
fraction of the price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did not matter to the people inside who were there for their own 
little piece of Streisand. Tom Colwell, who works in the data processing 
department at Warner Bros., paid $100 for a chrome-and-wood coffee set and $35 
for a waffle iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured, now when I make breakfast, I will think of her," said Colwell. 
"The waffle iron was a really good deal. I thought it would go for much more 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Colwell said he was also interested in item 417, an amber glass vase, and item 
597, an acrylic box with the initials BJS . He said he didn't have a limit on 
how much he would allow himself to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I really want it, I'll get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Veronica Loos, wearing a black hat emblazoned with "Barbra, The 
Concert." She paid $150 for a broken porcelain lamp and cared not a whit that 
she may have overpaid by about $140. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big fan," said Loos, "and I wanted to have a piece of her collection."

WOMAN IN PARKED CAR SLAIN AS SHE HOLDS BABY; CRIME: STRAY BULLET HITS SHOPPER 
AS SUSPECTED GANG MEMBER FIRES AT RIVALS.

 Rene Hurtado's 18-month-old daughter was crying when Hurtado returned to her 
car after making a quick purchase late Saturday night at a North Hills 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister-in-law and 18-month-old niece were also waiting in the car. 
Climbing into the driver's seat, Hurtado, 22, turned and picked up her daughter 
to quiet her before driving away. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the shooting began. Without warning, a suspected gang member began firing 
at a group of rival gang members across the parking lot near Plummer Street and 
Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bullets slammed through the windshield of Hurtado's car, striking 
her in the chest and just missing her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado's sister-in-law, Brenda Wong, raced to Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills, where Hurtado, of Panorama City, was pronounced dead at 10:25 
p.m., Van Nuys Division Police Sgt. Harry Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong and the two toddlers were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman was holding her daughter and the bullet apparently just missed the 
little girl," Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police could provide little information about Hurtado on Sunday. Wong and 
other family members gathered at Wong's North Hills apartment Sunday but 
declined to discuss the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfeld said officers spoke to a witness at the scene and have a description 
of the gunman. Police on Sunday suggested that they may have identified a 
suspect, but would not release more information. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Haddad, owner of Regal Liquor Market and Deli, said he heard about 10 
shots after Hurtado left his store Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "First there was about five shots, and then I heard another five shots," 
Haddad said Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The only visible sign of shooting Sunday was broken glass in the parking lot 
where Hurtado's car had been parked. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad said that after making her purchase and leaving the store, Hurtado had 
returned to get some change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if she hadn't come back for change, she would have left before the 
shooting started and she wouldn't have been shot," he said. 
</P>

SPIRIT OF ACHIEVEMENT MARKS GAY PRIDE PARADE; CELEBRATION: SIGNS OF PUBLIC 
ACCEPTANCE, POLITICAL ARRIVAL ARE ABUNDANT AS OFFICIALS AND POLICE IN UNIFORM 
TAKE PART. BUT CAMPY ROUTINES REMAIN IN THE EVENT'S 24TH YEAR.

<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, almost all gay police officers, doctors, lawyers, 
judges and elected officials were still ensconced in their closets. There were 
no gay and lesbian pride parades, and nobody had ever heard of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a quarter of a century makes. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the signs of change Sunday at the 24th annual pride parade in West 
Hollywood: 
</P>
<P>
 Gay and lesbian officers of the Los Angeles Police Department marched in 
uniform for the first time, receiving spirited applause from about 250,000 
spectators who packed the sidewalks for two miles along Santa Monica Boulevard 
between Crescent Heights and Robertson boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers walked hand-in-hand with their sons -- and their sons' lovers -- 
carrying placards that said: "We Love our Gay and Lesbian Children," while a 
tot in a stroller toted a poster proclaiming, "I My Gay Grandpa." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of convertibles wheeled by, brimming with gay judges, prosecutors, 
lawyers, scientists and clergy. There was even a float announcing a new gay 
traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
 While cross-dressing and campy routines remain parade staples, the signs of 
growing political empowerment in the "Gay Nineties" were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Miller, California's acting secretary of state and the first openly gay 
candidate to receive a major party's nomination for a statewide office in 
California, was in one convertible. And another carried Sheila James Kuehl, the 
feminist attorney, law professor and former television star who seeks to 
represent the Westside, Malibu and part of the San Fernando and Conejo valleys 
in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg was honored as Woman of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while Mayor Richard Riordan scored political points when he rode in last 
year's parade, he left this year's duty to the gay members of his cabinet -- 
David Novak and Deputy Mayors Mike Keeley and Dave Cobb, who waved from a 
convertible identifying them as "GIMOS" -- gays in the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a transition," mused Michael Yates, president of Christopher 
Street West/Los Angeles, which has sponsored the pride parade since 1970. "It 
started out very social, through the bars, and now we're being represented (in 
public offices) by our own people." 
</P>
<P>
 The 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots next month provided the theme for 
the parade, and some historical perspective. The four-night melee was triggered 
by a routine police raid of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's 
Greenwich Village and gave birth to the fledgling gay and lesbian civil rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles a year later, the first gay pride parade commemorating the 
riots had difficulty winning permits from reluctant police and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although gay rights now have won acceptance from mainstream politicians, Yates 
said, the agenda is incomplete. At the top of the "to do" list, he said, is 
winning funding for AIDS research and passage of California's domestic partners 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoy who we are, our culture," Yates said. "We've tried to develop a 
celebratory atmosphere."

VISITING WORLD CUP FAN WOUNDED IN ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A New York soccer fan in town for the World Cup tournament was mugged and shot 
Sunday morning near MacArthur Park in what police said was a random attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Ganancioso, 36, and a friend were walking to a liquor store near 8th and 
Alvarado streets shortly after 1 a.m. when they were assaulted, said Officer 
Rigo Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 Four young males accosted the two men, Romero said, and stole Ganancioso's 
wallet and gold jewelry. One man shot Ganancioso in both arms with a 
.25-caliber handgun. Ganancioso's friend, who was not identified by police, was 
not robbed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganancioso was taken to Hospital of the Good Samaritan, where he was treated 
for gunshot wounds in his left wrist and upper right arm, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. He was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said it did not appear that the two men were targeted because they were 
tourists. The World Cup tournament starts Saturday in Pasadena.

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downtown Los Angeles at the turn of the century offered much the same array of 
government services you find today -- assessor, coroner, courts and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was something extra then that even some government employees 
considered practically official: Pearl Morton's bordello. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hub of political power -- indeed, in a building that had served as the 
courthouse -- sat Los Angeles' most famous brothel. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton operated her sporting establishment in the Murrieta Building at Spring 
and Temple streets, where the Hall of Justice now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 She ran it with the full knowledge and even the patronage of the law: Her 
landlord was Deputy Sheriff Juan Murrieta (for whom Murrieta Hot Springs in 
Riverside County is named). Her operations proceeded within sight of the Los 
Angeles police station and the old County Courthouse, a red sandstone building 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the reputed workings of Heidi Fleiss, the alleged "madam to the 
stars," men -- including men in city and county uniform -- never had to call 
ahead for a date; they just dropped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Their "hostess" was L.A.'s bawdiest madam. She was so fondly remembered that 
40 years after her heyday, when the movie "Gone With the Wind" was released, 
those who had known Morton said Ona Munson, who played Belle Watling, the madam 
of the movie's house of ill repute, was made up to look exactly like her, down 
to her dyed red hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton ran the most lavish, the most lucrative and perhaps the most genteel 
prostitution business in Los Angeles. Her charity for all and her malice toward 
none made her L.A.'s most loved and respected madam -- at least by men. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a soft touch for local charities and anyone with a sad story. 
</P>
<P>
 However she dressed in her ostentatious quarters, when Morton went out in 
public, she always dressed respectably. What may have given her away was her 
rose-water perfume, which many thought was an aphrodisiac used only by fast 
women or fancy ladies. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parlor featured overstuffed chairs, massive chandeliers, full-length 
mirrors in magnificently carved, gilt-edged frames, thick red carpets, huge oil 
paintings of naked fat ladies and two Steinway pianos. 
</P>
<P>
 Former customers particularly remembered one of Pearl's girls, Dolly, who 
played the piano and made clients laugh. She also went to church on Sundays, 
much to the congregation's surprise. Dolly was fond of remarking that men love 
to laugh and that was something wives rarely did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diamond-Tooth Charlie," Dr. Charles William Bryson, dropped by weekly in his 
carriage pulled by two white horses to check Pearl's girls for occupational 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton's clientele included railroad executives, lawyers, mayors and senators. 
They came from Sacramento, Washington and New York. U.S. Sen. Stephen White 
became a frequent visitor, and Earl Rogers, a famous attorney, stayed for weeks 
at a time during drinking binges and always sent Morton gifts of books at 
Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early but effective form of direct advertising, Pearl and her strumpets 
would get all gussied up in their finest, with plumed hats, to take the air in 
an open carriage. Up behind the women sat a little old Irishman in a green 
coat, blowing a trumpet to announce their obvious arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 When Morton wasn't in such a flamboyant mood, she gave the trumpeter the day 
off and rode about with her white bulldog. 
</P>
<P>
 People clustered on the street to watch when Morton and one of her 
competitors, Cora Phillips, the owner of the Golden Lion on Alameda Street, 
drove in their hacks to Agricultural Park -- later Exposition Park and the site 
of the Coliseum -- to bet on the novelty entertainment of the day, auto races. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, all the girls would climb into their carriages and race one another 
back Downtown, whooping and yelling and good-naturedly calling one another 
names. And men in their buggies would race right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1909, when the horse and buggy began to give way to the Model T, Mayor 
Arthur C. Harper resigned from office amid charges that he was taking payoffs 
from gambling casinos and was often found inebriated in Morton's brothel. But 
Harper claimed that he was only on a fact-finding mission. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, a reform administration called the "Crusade Against Vice" 
eliminated brothels -- even the upscale ones -- for the first time in Los 
Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parlor houses and cribs were padlocked. . . . The girls were scattered 
throughout the rooming houses of Los Angeles. Poker games were silent. A haze 
of holiness heavy as a Pittsburgh pall settled upon the disgruntled pioneers." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the sarcastic words of Alfred Cohn and Joe Chisholm, who wrote 
"L.A. -- The Chemically Pure," in 1913. They blamed the blotting-out of public 
sin on the invasion of "Midwest Puritans into the land of the Padres and the 
Dons." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton skipped town and headed north for the more welcoming climate of San 
Francisco's Barbary Coast. She soon became known as the "Queen of the 
Underworld" at the Uptown Tenderloin establishment on Mason Street, at least 
until 1917, when the Red Light Abatement Act destroyed all the parlors, 
including hers. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

BOY, 15, HURT IN FALL AT DISNEYLAND HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old boy was injured early Sunday when he fell 20 feet from a 
Monorail platform at the Disneyland Hotel, the first serious accident since the 
ride opened in 1959, according to a Disneyland official. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, Edward Paolello of Santa Maria, was transported to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange immediately after the 12:30 a.m. fall.He was listed in fair 
condition with a shattered right elbow, a fractured left wrist and a hairline 
fracture of his pelvis, said Karen Wucetich, a hospital supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolello, who had been staying at the hotel with friends, was apparently 
accidentally pushed over a short wall and off the platform by a surge of 
Disneyland visitors as they left the Monorail, said his mother, Sylvia. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager landed on a concrete parking area near the entrance to the 
hotel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had just gone through the turnstile and looked back to see his friend," 
said Sylvia Paolello, 42, a home health aide. "He didn't realize the change in 
the path and he wound up falling over the wall. He was so lucky, so lucky he 
wasn't more seriously hurt."

INS LEADER VOWS TO BEEF UP BORDER PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's top immigration official Sunday promised reinforcements and new, 
high-tech equipment to help beleaguered Border Patrol agents stem illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner made 
the pledge during a tour of the Border Patrol's San Diego sector, which 
accounts for half of the 1.2 million illegal immigrants arrested each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to start where the problem is the biggest, and it's the biggest 
here," Meissner told reporters at the Imperial Beach Border Patrol station. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next six months, 400 Border Patrol officers will be added to the 
San Diego area. Agents also will get 222 new patrol vehicles equipped with 
encrypted radios to bypass eavesdropping smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the reinforcements will be stationed along a 14-mile stretch of border 
running from the Otay Mountains east of San Diego to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The reinforcements will consist of new recruits and redeployed veteran 
officers, Meissner said. The first class of 40 newly hired officers already is 
on the job.

'WE HAVE ARRIVED'; ATHLETES, ACTIVISTS AND CULTURE AFICIONADOS: WHAT THEY HAVE 
IN COMMON IS NEW YORK AND GAY PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the biggest, most spirited families imaginable is about to converge 
here, clogging the streets in a way that may be historic, celebrating with 
parties around the clock and booking as many rooms as the hotels can 
accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
 The gay and lesbian throngs are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way that a family reunion might find one group of cousins spending 
the whole day playing softball, another around a table studying the family 
tree, and yet another worrying if there's enough to eat, almost every 
permutation of gay group is holding its own event June 18-25 to coincide with 
the Gay Games IV and Cultural Festival and the 25th anniversary of Stonewall, a 
bar riot that helped spark the modern gay rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 11,000 people are registered to participate in the games, an 
Olympic-style event consisting of 31 sports, from same-sex figure skating to 
ice hockey, badminton to tennis, physique to power-lifting and a marathon of 
two loops around Manhattan. Anybody can enter the games -- gay or straight, 
athletic or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the day after the closing ceremonies at Yankee Stadium, from 300,000 to 
1 million people -- depending on who's doing the estimating -- are expected for 
"Stonewall 25," a march and rally commemorating the 1969 police raid on a 
Greenwich Village bar that is said to have launched the gay rights movement. 
Gay pride events across America have been rescheduled so as not to conflict 
with the New York celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The week will include such events as a conference for the Gay & Lesbian 
Parents' Coalition, the National Gay Pilots Assn. convention, a reception for 
the gay People of Color Caucus, the International Conference of Bisexuality and 
the International Mr. Deaf Leather Contest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The gay community has reached a predictable point in a community's maturation: 
not everybody is interested in everybody else's activities -- particularly the 
athletes and the activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Louie, a Los Angeles graphic designer who was born in New York, has 
invited his whole family to watch him compete in swimming and in-line skating. 
His parents, who have slowly come to accept his homosexuality, have even asked 
him to get them tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 For Louie, who is HIV positive, swimming with the West Hollywood Aquatics Team 
has motivated him to stay in shape and left him a great devotee to his mostly 
gay team, which is sending 100 swimmers to New York.  
</P>
<P>
 But the minute the competition ends, Louie is returning to Los Angeles rather 
than staying for the march and rally commemorating the Stonewall riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't mean something to me in my gut," says Louie, 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Spicochi, head of "Team LA," a group of 500 athletes, says so much has 
gone into preparing for the games -- from picking team uniform colors to 
finding accommodations for the athletes -- that no one gave much thought to 
political events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't care less about Stonewall," he says. "The reason we're going is 
to compete. We're first and foremost athletes of all abilities and all sports. 
At most Stonewall will bring us more spectators. Which is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Stoddard, who helped lead the fight against the Pentagon's policy against 
homosexuals, has no interest in the Gay Games. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, the week's high point will be a panel he is mediating at the New York 
City Bar Assn. on the legal aftermath of Stonewall. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddard is completely caught up in the emotions of the 25th anniversary of 
what he calls "the revolution against the oppression of millions of men and 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being 46 years old and doing this work because it has given me a 
perfect view of all of the modern movement," says Stoddard, who for years 
headed the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a legal rights group for gays. "The sad 
part of all this is that a lot of colleagues are not around because of illness 
and death." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddard sees the anticipated chaos, confusion and complexity of the June 
events in New York as a perfect commemoration of the birth of a movement that 
now reflects all of those things in a city that also reflects them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have arrived," Stoddard says. "We can be diverse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first Gay Games were held in a similarly frenetic city, San Francisco, in 
1982 and were conceived by Tom Waddell, a doctor and a decathlete in the 1968 
Mexico City Olympics. Waddell, who died of AIDS in 1987, had run into so much 
homophobia as an Olympic athlete that he said he believed it was important for 
gays to have an opportunity to do their personal best in sports without 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the spirit of Dr. Waddell, the purpose of the games is to break a lot of 
stereotypes and show that we're a proud and visible community and that we set 
records too," says Jay Hill, executive director of the Gay Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ric Munoz, an exceptional marathon runner from Los Angeles who is HIV 
positive, says he has little concern for making political statements through 
his participation in the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for one. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Munoz: "I only hope my running in the winner's circle will make someone 
who is HIV positive think twice about giving up everything and say at least 'I 
can go for walks; I can do some swimming; I can do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't refer to these as the Gay Olympics, Hill cautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Gay Games are held every four years and have all the trappings 
of such an event -- from team uniforms to T-shirts and sponsors -- the 
International Olympic Committee went to court several years ago to make sure 
the games' organizers never used the term.  
</P>
<P>
 The problems surrounding Gay Games and Stonewall 25 are typical of those at 
any mega-event. Already, there is a litany of complaints: 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are upset that New York's annual Gay Pride Parade has been 
supplanted by a more somber march without floats, drag queens, costumes and 
music. And the route of the march from the United Nations to Central Park has 
been so long in dispute that at the moment it's unclear how the masses will get 
across and up town. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some athletes are grumbling that locations for certain competitions 
haven't been secured and that cultural events accompanying competitions haven't 
been tightly organized. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is concern for people coming from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Games officials anticipate about 3,300 athletes will come from overseas while 
Stonewall 25 will draw several thousand from other countries. Although the U.S. 
government approved a 10-day visa waiver for those who have AIDS or are HIV 
positive -- the first such waiver for anything other than a medical conference 
-- it is unclear whether the government will grant political asylum to gays 
wishing to leave countries where they are persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's money. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of both the games and the march are concerned that they won't have 
enough money to run their operations. Games officials have raised $6 million -- 
with Miller Brewing the largest sponsor -- while Stonewall 25 coordinators have 
come up with $2.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, considering the size of the extravaganza, the complaints from 
conservative quarters has been relatively marginal. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York city school board member, a Bronx minister who heads a Latino 
clergy group, and a local conservative activist held a news conference last 
month charging that the games promote homosexuality and that HIV-infected 
athletes could pose a health risk if they engage in unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ruben Diaz, who is also an appointee to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's 
Civilian Complaint Review Board, says the games "will teach our young adults 
and children that homosexuality is OK, that it is not immoral or sinful 
behavior or that this kind of behavior is not biologically dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Giuliani quickly disassociated himself from the minister's remarks, noting 
that such comments by Diaz and other critics "contribute to fear and 
misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 The gay events, after all, are likely to be an incredible boon to the city 
economy: They're projected to generate as much as $400 million. And these 
protests are whispers compared to the bellows of recognition coming from New 
York's Establishment. Such pillars of society as the Yale Club, the Museum of 
the City of New York and the Brooklyn Historical Society are demonstrating 
approval with exhibits, events, conferences, lectures and panels. Even the New 
York Public Library is holding a major exhibit in honor of Stonewall 25 from 
June through September. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's gay community will be offering more entertaining shows. In addition 
to the usual clubs and restaurants, many party sites such as Roseland, 
Danceteria, the Palladium and the USS Intrepid -- parked in the Hudson River -- 
will be taken over for celebrations.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hanan, a New York actor, says he won't attend the games nor the noisy 
dance parties because "I'm too old, the music is too loud and they're not 
smoke-free," but he marvels at the size of the June activities and of the 
increasing numbers of younger gay men and lesbians who come to these events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very inspiring to feel that we are like a transitional generation," says 
Hanan, who is 47 and who went to last year's gay rights march in Washington, 
D.C.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never could have dreamed as a teen-ager to walk hand in hand with the 
same-sex partner. Now, there are these enormous marches." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Stonewall riots have become the emblematic event, they were not 
necessarily as monumental a turning point in radicalizing gays as AIDS has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Stonewall has become the moment of gay history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the riot came in 1969 at the end of the '60s when so many 
challenges to authority had been made is critical," says Martin Duberman, who 
recently completed a book on the Stonewall riots. "It couldn't have happened in 
1959." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe even two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason many people fought back while they were being taken away by 
police raiding the Stonewall Inn that June 27, 1969, night was that emotions 
had been running high in gay homes in Greenwich Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Garland, a gay icon, had died a few days earlier and her funeral was that 
day in New York. Many gays identified with her vulnerability and emotionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, there is no one reason for the outburst," says Duberman about the 
days of rioting prompted by the raid. "The tension had for so long been 
building." 
</P>
<P>
 Duberman says the march and the rally -- and even the games -- are important 
so that gays don't lose their history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is it will be our 15 minutes and that will be that," Duberman 
says. "But I don't think so because so many people are 'out' now. The best that 
can happen is that people will take the energy back to their local communities 
and put it into action."

JACK SMITH: ONE NEW GUY'S SIREN SONG IS ANOTHER MAN'S LULLABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the disadvantages of being a columnist in Los Angeles is that civic 
loyalty robs you of one of a columnist's favorite targets -- Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably no other city in the nation has been so continually bashed in 
newspapers as our own -- the City of Angels. Pundits from H.L. Mencken to Mike 
Royko have made sport of us with their biting humor.  
</P>
<P>
 Mencken said, "the whole place stank of orange blossoms," and Royko said they 
ought to build a fence around it to keep its natives from escaping and 
infecting the rest of the country. (I'm afraid it's too late to protect Royko's 
Chicago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Columnists from Nashville to Fresno have bashed us, although not much has been 
heard from Fresno since the mayor of Bakersfield called it the gateway to 
Bakersfield. Or was it the other way around? Either way, it was no great 
compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Seattle has joined the chorus and more recently Montreal. 
Reader Ann Ibbotson sends me a column written for the Montreal Gazette by Josh 
Freed, who evidently has recently moved to Los Angeles. Like Freed himself, I 
wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he went into a Los Angeles gun shop to price guns, which he finds 
essential for the protection of life and limb in our city. The salesman said: 
"You moved from Montreal to L.A.? Man, you're crazy! That's like going from 
heaven to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's right," Freed says. "American cities like Los Angeles have become eerie 
combat zones, where you are always instinctively on guard. Like most people 
here, I think twice before parking on a side street. I never walk outside at 
night, and why would I want to? The only people on the streets carry bedrolls. 
You become suspicious of the homeless, of panhandlers, of anyone who looks 
weird or different than you." 
</P>
<P>
 While I don't mean to dismiss Freed's entire thesis, I suspect that it would 
be difficult for a homeless person to mug somebody with his bedroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I awoke at 2 a.m. yesterday in truly L.A. style," he writes, "with a 
helicopter circling my street and a spotlight scouring the bushes. As I write, 
I can hear the ever-present wail of sirens racing off toward muggings, murder 
and mayhem." 
</P>
<P>
 I often hear helicopters and sirens at night from our house on Mount 
Washington, but I simply go back to sleep, comforted by this proof that our 
protective services are doing their job. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed describes Los Angeles as an armed camp and says he never walks outside 
at night and tries not to park on a side street. "That's why valet service is 
so commonplace here. Parking yourself may reduce your life expectancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Freed assumes that all other drivers in the city are armed and is careful not 
to offend any. Recently he was driving with a friend, he says, when a car 
swerved in front of them. "Don't honk!" his friend warned. "They may be armed!" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he speculates, it is the proliferation of guns that makes Los Angeles 
drivers so much more polite than those in Montreal "partly because I think they 
are terrified of offending other drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Freed says there were 1,100 homicides last year in Los Angeles, a dreadful 
figure indeed. Still, the odds against any one person being murdered -- namely 
oneself -- are probably about as good as those of winning the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking at night is still safe and congenial if you pick your place. Old Town 
Pasadena, for example, has been revitalized in recent years and is thronged 
with strollers almost every night. It has several movie theaters, avant-garde 
restaurants and clothing stores, and is much frequented by the young. Of 
course, it is always possible that one can be gunned down by a drive-by 
lunatic, and there is always the chance of being bumped off the sidewalk by a 
gang of pubescent girls. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never worried much about being robbed, mugged or shot, but I admit that 
crime has touched my family in recent weeks. First, my older son's car was 
broken into and stripped of its radio and other items while parked in front of 
his West Los Angeles home; then our younger son's vintage Porsche was stolen 
and wrecked; then my wife's telephone was stolen from her (unlocked) car in 
front of our house. That's bringing the crime wave close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do about it? First, lock your car and don't drop the keys in the 
street. Second, walk in crowds. Third, stay home and watch TV. It's dull, it's 
demoralizing and it's a degenerate pastime, but at least it's fairly safe. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember, when you hear a siren wailing in the night, it's only the 
lullaby of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And our drivers are polite. 
</P>

COMMITMENTS; THE FIGHT TO BE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the choice of being right or being happy, we cling to our opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an inescapable fact of human nature. We spend our lives wrangling and 
fussing, going toe to toe over who's right and who's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 We pay a big price for our stubborn insistence on correctness. Friendships 
fracture, marriages burst and, on a global scale, nations go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, we might compromise here and there, but there always lurks in each 
person's heart the secret conviction that he or she alone knows the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it we must always be right? 
</P>
<P>
 One reason may be that it makes evolutionary sense to have all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of survival, it's better to be right than not right," said Frederick 
Koenig, a professor of social psychology at Tulane University in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're brought up, 'wrong' is counterproductive and negative," Koenig 
said. "People who are right more often than others are considered superior, 
because that's a sign of intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 And as everyone knows, he added, "There's a certain amount of gratification in 
being smarter than somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 There are really two ways to be right, Koenig contended. 
</P>
<P>
 One has to do with factual correctness. Right in this sense means that a fact 
or statement can be checked. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of rightness doesn't usually cause much human suffering (with the 
possible exception of those who live with "Jeopardy" contestants and baseball 
trivia nuts). 
</P>
<P>
 But right also refers to moral or emotional rightness, arising from personal 
values -- and this is where things get really sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get to value questions, being right is very important to your whole 
world view," Koenig said. Opinions about abortion, gay rights or capital 
punishment spring from broad beliefs about how things are or ought to be. 
Likewise, we may have a deep psychological need to see ourselves as good or 
righteous (even when we're at fault). 
</P>
<P>
 When the emotional and moral stakes are high, Koenig said, "there's not any 
room for equivocation." 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig cited the example of those who are convinced there was a conspiracy to 
kill President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning it seemed to me very clear it was done by Oswald, and 
that's all there was to it," Koenig said. "I couldn't see what the fuss was 
about, but there are people who devoted 30 years to this on the assumption the 
CIA and the government can't be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somehow important to people, not only because of their distrust of the 
government, but a 30-year investment in this belief." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, when defending your world view, "you have to be consistent," 
Koenig said. Seeking to eliminate the dissonance between inconvenient facts and 
their beliefs, people often simply dismiss the offending evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigidity, experts say, can be related to self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have a strong ego -- who are self-satisfied and confident about 
themselves -- don't have to win every argument," Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender differences also arise.  
</P>
<P>
 Generally, "women are more willing to try to compromise," he said. "It's not 
so important for women to triumph." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Alfie Kohn thinks much of our need to be right comes from our cultural 
upbringing, which emphasizes the gulf between winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn, author of the influential book "No Contest: The Case Against 
Competition" (Houghton Mifflin, 1986), argues that many disputes are really 
power contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a difference between trying to be accurate and having a prideful 
investment in not giving in," he said. "If you and I get in an argument and I 
start defending my position because I want to score points, it's more 
problematic." 
</P>
<P>
 A former nationally ranked high school debater, Kohn knows whereof he speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In debating, "the goal is not to reach the truth. The goal is to marshal 
arguments selectively to win," he said. "It took years after my debate training 
to say, 'Huh. That's a good point -- I never thought of that.' " It's a short 
step from debate club to law school, where students learn that no idea is 
intrinsically better than another because an argument can be made for either 
side. Kohn calls this aspect of legal reasoning "a very cynical world view." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn blames it all on America's "state religion" -- competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in this culture are raised to look upon others as obstacles to our 
success. That pernicious world view is stamped on us with musical chairs, 
spelling bees and Little League, and even parents who say, 'All right, kids, 
who can get in their pajamas fastest?' " 
</P>
<P>
 All this, he said, leads to "either-or" thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "From either-or, we start to think in terms that are black-and-white," he 
said. "That becomes 'we-they' -- us against them." 
</P>
<P>
 People from other cultures, especially non-Western societies, see our 
preoccupation with winning and losing as baffling, Kohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Koenig, Kohn sees gender differences in how badly people need to be 
right, in particular "the famous macho need not to back down, on which altar 
millions have lost their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 One example, he said, was Lyndon Johnson's refusal to pull American troops out 
of Vietnam: LBJ is said to have declared that he wasn't going to be the first 
President to lose a war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate false dichotomy is thinking, 'Am I going to be a winner or a 
loser?' -- in conversation, in business or world affairs," Kohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no hope for us unless we realize those are two versions of the same 
competitive world view. The real alternative to being No. 1 is not being No. 2, 
but to dispense with these categories altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 The obsessive need to be right (and for everyone else to be wrong) has 
poisoned our public discourse, contends Virginia author Andrew Bard Schmooker, 
who explored human conflict in his book "Out of Weakness: Healing the Wounds 
That Drive Us to Make War" (Bantam, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
 Political pundits spouting pithy televised sound bites exemplify the trend, 
Schmooker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great temptation to take simplistic black-or-white positions, 
because the market will reward them more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These same forces shape our expectation of how leaders should lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would rather have someone who speaks without a wavering of 
uncertainty," Schmooker said. "One has to posture as if one is already there. 
Otherwise, people are uncomfortable."

COMMITMENTS; TAKING WORK HOME; HAVING THE SAME CAREER CAN STRENGTHEN THE BONDS 
BETWEEN COUPLES, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA LYNN PARKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judith Tyler and Rudyard Taylor started out as classmates, sharing a passion 
for animals at Tuskegee University School of Veterinary Medicine in Alabama. 
Now they double as colleagues at work and partners at home in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 When their boys were young, the couple toted them to the Harbor City hospital 
where she specializes in small animals and he in large animals. They say 
they've never hesitated to ask one another for advice on cases. Away from the 
office, they've agreed not to talk shop with their closest friends -- 
colleagues from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether one spouse works full time or part time, such like-mindedness is 
typical of same-career marriages, according to psychologists and anecdotal 
evidence. Although the marital balance can occasionally tilt from compatibility 
to competitiveness as one spouse sees what their better half is achieving, 
their shared career can be a plus, giving them more than just conversation 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they start on a collegial basis, it's a fertile territory for common 
ground," said Judith M. Harris, a psychotherapist with offices in Encino and 
South Pasadena. "There is a certain built-in understanding of what the other 
person goes through in their work life and what is frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann and Steve Vollmer of Van Nuys together have more than 40 years' experience 
running park programs. "We have a lot of empathy for each other," said Ann, a 
recreation director at Palisades Park in Pacific Palisades. Steve has a similar 
post at the larger Mar Vista Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports programs, day camps . . . we've both been through it," Ann said. "When 
he comes home with that look on his face, I know." 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits go beyond understanding unruly park patrons, long hours or crazy 
schedules to include the exhilaration of sharing goals and passions. Having the 
same career "builds camaraderie, connectedness and bonding," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychotherapist Sandra Lyons Rowe said she and her husband, Daryl, have a 
deeper understanding of each other not only because they do the same thing, but 
because they do it for the same reasons. "We get a thrill out of having a 
(positive) impact on people's lives," said Rowe, who teaches psychology courses 
at Loyola Marymount University. Both practice at the Nubian Psychological Group 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Built on shared values and passions, these relationships can mutually enhance 
careers. In addition to bouncing ideas off each other about animal diseases or 
sports programs or nameless clients, spouses help each other with words of 
encouragement. And never underestimate the power of extra ears out there taking 
in the news about people or politics from the rumor mill. Also, attending 
obligatory functions together means networking is a double investment. 
</P>
<P>
 When attorney Jennifer Floyd attends functions with her husband, Curtis, who 
is building his own practice, business often is thrown her way. "Sometimes 
people would prefer to deal with a female attorney. Or even some of his clients 
who find out I'm an attorney may prefer to deal with me on another matter," 
said Floyd, who, like her husband, specializes in personal injury cases in 
Bakersfield.  
</P>
<P>
 Competition can exist in these marriages, experts said. Lawyers, who are 
competitive by profession, are especially susceptible, said Barbara Newman, a 
marriage and family therapist who has a practice in West Los Angeles. "It can 
be very stressful if you see your spouse as a possible rival or contender for 
the same clientele." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivalry can be based on salary or recognition and can cause conflict. 
Sometimes the rivalry is more covert than acknowledged, psychotherapist Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Floyds, who have been married about three years, say their competition 
arises not in the courtroom but in the living room. They both describe 
discussions on social or legal topics that go on and on like a legal brief. 
"She'll use lawyer tricks and analogies to build her case," Curtis Floyd said. 
"We both always think we're correct. She's opinionated and doesn't change her 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 And does he? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always correct," Floyd said matter-of-factly before laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to finding a balance is not letting your ego get in the way of being 
happy for your spouse, Newman said. She acknowledged that this can be 
particularly hard if one spouse becomes very successful and the other is 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 When couples spend their days doing the same thing, inequities at home become 
even more apparent. The question becomes: Who will give up career time to take 
care of what needs to be done at home? said Joan Berman, a therapist who 
practices in Brentwood.  
</P>
<P>
 Most couples who tackle these issues follow convention, with the wife managing 
the house, children and social calendar, experts said. But a woman whose career 
is taking the back seat for the family has a daily reminder of just where she 
could be. Some are resentful; many congratulate themselves for juggling so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler, who cared for her sons in between cats and dogs at the animal hospital, 
struggled to sacrifice neither career nor children. She said it is rewarding 
for both her and her husband to be able to work and care for their boys, now 
21, 18 and 11.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I was doing surgery, he took care of them. If he was doing surgery, I took 
over," she said. "It was interesting to say the least, but I didn't say it was 
easy."

 The Scene: Starting at rush hour -- 5 p.m. -- on Thursday, L.A. motorists, 
arriving in everything from Hondas to Rolls-Royces, battled stop-and-go 
mid-Wilshire traffic and self-parked to be the first to cruise through the 
Petersen Automotive Museum at its grand opening gala. Exhibiting autos antique, 
futuristic, famous and prehistoric (a prop from "The Flintstones"), the museum 
opened to the public Saturday. The $40-million museum at Wilshire Boulevard and 
Fairfax Avenue began with a $15-million donation for the purchase of the site 
(the former Ohrbach's building) from Petersen Publishing founder and Chairman 
Robert E. Petersen and his wife, Margie. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Stuck in social gridlock, a crowd of 2,000 packed the place. 
Among them: Gov. Pete Wilson, performing ribbon-cutting duties with the 
Petersens; event chairs Marion Laurie and car designer Carroll Shelby; James 
Garner; Mel Torme; Ann Miller ("I don't think you can beat Cadillacs"); Steve 
Garvey; Bruce Jenner, and Craig Black, director of the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz: "I remember when" yarns, as in, "I remember when Uncle Harry kept a 
Packard in his garage." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Asked if she was as big a car enthusiast as her husband (whose 
magazine empire includes Hot Rod, Motor Trend and Car Craft), Margie Petersen 
replied, "Not really. But it sort of has rubbed off on me. I love cars, but I 
don't think anybody could be as much of a car buff as him. He drives about 10. 
I have two, a Mercedes and a Cadillac, but I get to drive his too." 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Proceeds from the $125 tickets, a silent auction and a raffle 
will be divided equally between the museum and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Identify a Real Car Nut: "I talk about cars with great prudence," 
explained car collector Nicola Bulgari of the Italian jewelry company, who 
estimates that he owns 25. "I don't impose my will on anyone else. A real car 
nut is not respectful of anybody. He just talks and talks and talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "Look at Joan Crawford's car -- look at how she tooled around," 
said a woman admiring the late actress's 1933 Model 452C Town Car by Fleetwood. 
"I like your limo better," responded her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: Signs at the bars reading, "Please Don't Drink and Drive."  
</P>
<P>
 Freebies: Car paraphernalia, including a miniature Franklin Mint Duesenberg, a 
sample of Formula 2001 Super Protectant (for rubber, vinyl and leather), a 
Flowmaster pin (from the exhaust technology company), a racing-car poster 
signed by Shelby and a free, one-year museum membership.

'SPEED' DRIVES TO A FAST START; MOVIES: THE THRILLER PASSES 'THE FLINTSTONES,' 
WHILE 'CITY SLICKERS II' GALLOPS TO THIRD AT THE BOX OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Twentieth Century Fox's "Speed" dispatched the competition over the weekend, 
swiping front-runner box-office status from "The Flintstones" with estimates of 
about $14 million grossed from more than 2,100 screens. The vehicular thriller 
starring Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper is about a mad bomber who obviously 
doesn't think the L.A. traffic situation is tangled enough and booby-traps a 
city bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "City Slickers II," a sequel to the Billy Crystal yuppies-on-the-range hit 
comedy of two summers back, was anticipating a more-than-respectable $11.5 
million in 2,243 theaters. That brought the Columbia release in behind both 
"Speed" and "The Flintstones," though industry insiders had earlier expected it 
to be the No. 1 film for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flintstones" continued unstoppable. Universal estimated that the film 
would likely gross in the neighborhood of $12 million on 2,555 screens, down 
about 33% from the previous weekend. The live-action version of the animated TV 
series has captured $81 million after only three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, "The Flintstones" has the family-film market to itself. Industry 
insiders are watching to see how well it holds up when other movies aimed at 
the same audience such as "The Lion King" and "Getting Even With Dad," with 
Macaulay Culkin, open over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Momentum had been building on "Speed" from its early sneak previews, says Fox 
distribution head Tom Sherak. Better-than-usual reviews for an action film 
indicated the possibility of a major sleeper. But even Fox executives were not 
expecting "Speed" to burst out of the gate with such alacrity, according to 
Sherak. Originally set to debut in August, the studio had even been 
contemplating moving it back to October to avoid a summer movie pileup. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead it was rushed forward to early June, which could prove to be a wise 
move, giving the movie business a much-needed boost. Even with the smash debut 
of "Speed," box-office figures lagged 25% behind the comparable weekend in 1993 
when a little movie called "Jurassic Park" opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Speed" had unexpected momentum of its own. After Friday's speedy 
$4.1-million opening day, Sherak was still predicting no more than $12 million 
for the weekend, based on the normal pattern of Friday being the biggest night 
for action films. "Speed," however, boasts a similar appeal to last year's "The 
Fugitive" -- lots of action with low body count -- and Saturday business jumped 
44%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maverick" ambled along with an estimated $6.8 million, bringing its total to 
more than $66 million after a month in release. Disney's "Renaissance Man" did 
not open strongly a weekend earlier but fell only 25% in its second weekend to 
about $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, "Speed" crippled most of the action competition, including "Beverly 
Hills Cop III," which slipped to about $3.5 million (from $6.6 million a 
weekend earlier). "The Cowboy Way" also dropped precipitously to $2.8 million 
(from $5 million) as did "The Crow" to $2.3 million (from $4 million). 
</P>
<P>
 If "Speed" continues to race, it could fuel the summer's moviegoing attendance 
figures. The big pop quiz this year is that, barring another unforeseen 
$300-million grossing monster on the order of "Jurassic Park," what do you do 
for an encore to the biggest summer in box-office history? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, say studio distribution executives, is to succeed through sheer 
volume. To achieve that, several $100-million-plus blockbusters will need to 
emerge from among a number of potential candidates, including several family 
films such as Disney's animated "The Lion King," which debuts Wednesday, as 
well as a number of big-budget star vehicles including Jack Nicholson's "Wolf," 
opening Friday.

KIENHOLZ LEGACY REACHES PAST ART; AN AMERICAN ORIGINAL, THE ARTIST'S LIFE AND 
WORK FUELED THE FORCE OF THE BEAT GENERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ed Kienholz died Friday at 66 we lost more than a great American artist, 
as if that weren't melancholy enough. We lost a leading avatar of the Beat 
Generation. In the '50s, tiny bands of bohemian poets and artists in Venice, 
North Beach and Greenwich Village rebelled against those homogenizing times, 
igniting a cultural youth revolution that altered the fabric of American life 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe nothing is forever. Maybe the cut of Kienholz's passing stings 
with such special smartness because it is the omen of the passing of an era as 
well as the loss of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 He was part of a time of voracious artistic curiosity. Growing up on an 
isolated farm near his birthplace in Fairfield, Wash., Kienholz found life 
austere, his father strict, his mother a rigorous fundamentalist. He stared at 
the distant lights of Spokane and dreamed of a place he called, "Out There." At 
17, he hit the road where his picaresque exploits made Jack Kerouac's later 
adventures look a little tame. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the later Beats would model themselves on black jazz musicians, European 
Existentialism, and Japanese Zen, Kienholz was magnetized to the rhythm of 
honky-tonk America. Dives like Barney's Beanery and brothels like Roxie's 
outside Las Vegas became subjects of later work. It was all basically 
autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
 He was entirely self-taught and absolutely in the mold of the American rugged 
individualist and self-made man. In the end, no one category of endeavor could 
contain him, but one where he decidedly earned a place was in the annals of 
American folklore along with Paul Bunyan, P. T. Barnum and Billy Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a strapping Big Daddy type who ran his family like a clan and sported a 
Beelzebub goatee with eyebrows to match. He loved hunting, vintage cars and 
kids. He was married four times, finally to his art partner Nancy Reddin 
Kienholz, daughter of former LAPD top cop Tom Reddin. 
</P>
<P>
 A shrewd operator and ferocious deal-maker, the artist recalled that as a 
young man he needed a house so he bought a duplex, cut it in half with a 
chain-saw, sold one piece for the price he'd paid for the whole and lived in 
the other half for free. 
</P>
<P>
 As a gambler he was all but unbeatable. He could calculate odds in his head 
and shoot pool as if it were chess. He relished wiping out his friends but 
there were limits. Once, broke in San Francisco, he had a clean chance to roll 
a drunk who was literally bristling with $100 bills. Instead, he stuck him in a 
cab and intimidated the driver into taking him straight home. 
</P>
<P>
 His fundamental compassion fueled masterpieces like "The Wait," and "Sollie 
17," which concern the blight of age and loneliness.  
</P>
<P>
 He settled in Los Angeles in 1953, having found it possible to swap a piece of 
his art to get a toothache fixed. Before founding the cradle of the L.A. avant 
garde with Walter Hopps in the Ferus gallery, he started galleries of his own, 
usually in theater spaces like the old avant-garde Coronet on La Cienega. It 
was prescient. His art would be intensely theatrical. In a world where the 
categorical membranes were more permeable, it would be easy to get Keinholz a 
spot along with Beckett, Ionesco and Pinter in the Theater of the Absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistically, he invented the life-size tableau, rescuing the same 
19th-Century form of polite entertainment that inspired the Laguna "Pageant of 
the Masters." By the time of his controversial 1966 retrospective at the County 
Museum of Art, aesthetics were going minimal. Kienholz's notion of using 
life-size spaces would serve art as different from his own as the austere 
California Light and Space, but for him the idea was to get everything in, sex 
and religion, comedy and tragedy, the cliche and the profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Kienholz and the museum faced down the vulgarian attackers on the County Board 
of Supervisors and won more than the battle to show "Back Seat Dodge '38." They 
won the museum's political independence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, the Kienholzes moved to Berlin. In Europe, where they have the 
distance to appreciate American vernacular culture, Kienholz was revered as an 
American original like jazz, comics, Charlie Chaplin and Jerry Lewis. His 
influence shows in the work of Joseph Beuys and probably helped fuel German 
Neo-Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
 I visited him and Nancy last summer at their idyllic summer compound on a lake 
near the little town of Hope, Ida. A bit leery at first of his reputation as a 
practical joker, I found him admirable and sensitive. Up there, Kienholz was 
the great patriarch, surrounded by the young artists he liked to help, his 
family, old friends like Monte and Betty Factor, and a little African American 
girl nicknamed Tank he and Nancy informally adopted as part of a foundation to 
help poor kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed was clearly planning to depart the planet. He said the studios would go to 
the University of Idaho as a museum and training center. He had diabetes and 
could no longer feel his feet, but commented: "I've had a good run, a marvelous 
life. If it's time to go I'm not worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's gone. His admirers worry that somehow he won't get his artistic due 
since he has never had a major retrospective. One is planned for New York's 
Whitney Museum in 1996 but lots could go wrong. Most of his major works belong 
to European collectors. Shipping costs will be enormous. What if there are 
changes at the museum? 
</P>
<P>
 Well-wishers should be inclined, I think, to share Kienholz's serenity. If 
it's time to happen, it will happen. And, more important: It is simply 
impossible to imagine a history of the American aesthetic without him.

STILL ABUZZ OVER 'CHAINSAW'; FAN EXPO BRINGS OUT CROWD OF GRISLY FILM'S 
AFICIONADOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he was working on the 1974 splatterfest "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," 
Edwin Neal, at that time a self-described "serious actor," told his friends, " 
'It's a good thing I don't have to tell anyone in my family about this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the movie is a cottage industry commemorating its 20th anniversary, and 
his kids take him to school for show and tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, who played the wacked-out hitchhiker whose creepy relatives took their 
family slaughterhouse business public, sits alongside four other members of the 
original cast at a booth at Glendale Civic Auditorium, the site this past 
weekend for a cultural event dubbed "Horri Fi 1." The cast members have been 
meeting under similar circumstances with surprising regularity over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot for $140,000, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" made approximately $25 
million upon its initial release. Tobe Hooper's directorial debut effort is 
considered a classic of its genre, paving the way, for better or worse, for all 
the titillating yet bizarrely moralistic horror fables in which teens with 
dubiously set moral compasses receive grisly punishments far exceeding the 
gravity of their misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 At this fan expo, vendors and patrons haggle over the prices of old copies of 
Famous Monsters of Filmland; a guy in an Elvira T-Shirt loudly describes some 
forgotten classic in which someone's blood and brains ran copiously from his 
ears; busty, fright-flick survivors sit around peddling glossy publicity 
stills. Hard-core fans pay to have their picture taken wearing Leatherface's 
original butcher apron. A booth selling horror videocassettes serenades the 
"Chainsaw" cast from across the aisle with what Marilyn Burns, who starred as 
Sally, the sole survivor of the ordeal, estimates is the seventh replay of 
"Massacre" today. 
</P>
<P>
 A doting fan tries to flirt with Burns: "You're just as lovely as you were 20 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns laughs off the compliment, referring to a couple of publicity stills 
depicting her shrieking and drenched in bright red Karo syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I looked in 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' I never saw such nasty faces 
in my life. I figure, 20 years later, I can't lose. Compared to that, how can I 
possibly worry about how I look now?" 
</P>
<P>
 People seriously hung up on "Chainsaw" aren't like other people, and Neal and 
Burns accept their adulation with cheery bemusement. "We sign chain saws, we 
sign body parts -- people ask me to sign their arm, then they go to a tattoo 
parlor and have them tattoo my autograph," Neal says. "I ask them, 'What if, in 
a couple of years, you decide you don't like the movie anymore?' and they say, 
'Never!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people don't exist outside of these shows," jokes Neal, who 
still acts and produces in Austin, Tex. "They're trucked in from someplace just 
to these shows, then when they're over, they're herded back into trucks and 
taken back to wherever. This is the only place you see these kind of people -- 
this and Hollywood Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, who still acts in theater and films in Houston, recalls how physically 
demanding the role was. "That bruise on my face matched in continuity all 
through the picture because it was real. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there was this scene where I was running through smoke and falling down. 
We were up to Take 48, and only around Take 30 did it occur to someone to say, 
'Hey, she's bleeding; maybe she needs some kneepads.' . . . When they cut my 
finger, they forgot to tape up the knife edge. . . . They made me jump off a 
scaffolding. I hurt my leg -- that limping at the end of the movie wasn't 
acting." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Siedow, who retired six years ago in Houston from a life of acting and 
making commercials, got the gig as the Old Man to appease a union regulation. 
"I was the one SAG (Screen Actors Guild) actor. I was only there one week, and 
that week almost killed me." 
</P>
<P>
 John Dugan, who portrayed the grandfather who still harbored a little bit of 
blood lust, if not much life, had a similarly unpleasant experience. "I had a 
pound of liquid latex makeup on my head, and I just kind of zoned out. You can 
only be extremely uncomfortable for so long before your mind goes elsewhere. We 
shot for 26 hours, and when they finally pulled the mask off, all the blood had 
drained out of my head." 
</P>
<P>
 The woes continued upon the film's release -- it was assailed for its graphic 
nature. "There was all this horrible press, that we actually killed someone 
during the movie. But the bodies in the movie were brought in from India -- at 
that time, you could buy human bodies and legally bring them into the country," 
Neal explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many reviews were positive. "I had little faith in it," recalls Dugan, who 
today works on industrial films in Indiana. "But I remember when Roger Ebert 
reviewed it, he compared me to Dustin Hoffman in 'Little Big Man' . . . I 
thought, maybe there is something to this film." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunnar Hansen, who essayed the immortal role of Leatherface, the psychopathic, 
chain saw-wielding anti-hero for a disaffected generation, left Texas soon 
after the film wrapped to write in Maine. "I thought it would maybe win a small 
cult of fans, like 'Two Thousand Maniacs.' A couple of years later, I came out 
to L.A. and discovered while I was living this very different life in Maine, 
the picture was becoming more and more famous, and I had become this mystery 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the way, the videocassette booth has replaced "Chainsaw" with a cheesy 
version of "Dracula" starring Jack Palance. "Did they finally change the 
movie?" Burns asks. "Thank God."

UCLA PUTS INTERNATIONAL FOCUS ON 1994-95 SEASON; PERFORMING ARTS: TWO OF THE 12 
PACKAGES WILL BE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO WORLD MUSIC AND DANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA Center for the Performing Arts' 1994-95 season -- featuring 12 series 
of dance, music and theater -- will showcase performances by artists from 
around the globe, including Egypt, Turkey, Australia, Finland, Brazil and the 
South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Two series will be devoted entirely to world music and dance, including the 
Turkish Whirling Dervishes, recently featured in the film "Baraka" and 
appearing in the United States for the first time in a decade, on Nov. 19 at 
the Wadsworth Theater. That series will also offer the Afro-Cuban Jazz 
Orchestra, a group of Mario Bauza's original Latin jazz musicians, on Jan. 28 
at the Wadsworth; the Drummers of Burundi on March 31; and an Australian 
Aboriginal troupe, the Dancers of the Dreaming, on May 3, at the Sunset Canyon 
Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>

COUNTERPUNCH: ACTUALLY, BRANFORD, THERE WAS A REAL 'TONIGHT SHOW' BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOC SEVERINSEN, Doc Severinsen, Grammy Award-winning trumpet player and 
former director of The Tonight Show band, has made more than 30 albums in 40 
years. He tours with former members of the TV show's band, is involved in 
recordings, commercials and trumpet manufacturing and appears with various 
symphony orchestras as a guest conductor and performer of classical and pop 
music. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read the article about Branford Marsalis and his experiences on "The Tonight 
Show" ("Call It a Commercial Break," Calendar, May 22) and, while I found it 
interesting, some of it was totally erroneous and other parts created false 
impressions. Please note, I find Branford Marsalis to be a truly outstanding 
and wonderful musician, and his band to be very musically adept. However, I 
would like to correct and rebut some impressions that Marsalis' statements 
might have left in people's minds. 
</P>
<P>
 His assessment that "Stump the Band" was "corny" is to miss the point and the 
comic gifts of a real pro, Johnny Carson. To assume that we as musicians were 
demeaned by playing "Stump the Band" overlooks the fact that it was a light 
segment enjoyed by millions of Americans for many years. We were simply having 
fun. Not a bad thing to do, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
 At another point, he implies that our musicians were " . . . day players 
(working as needed on a daily rate)." Quite the contrary, our musicians were 
steady employees of the show and treated well financially without complaint. He 
also says, in referring to his band, he "treat(s) them with respect. That was 
something new, because the guys on the show before didn't have anybody really 
looking out for their interests, and it was unfortunate." This would imply that 
I did not look out for my musicians' interests and had no respect for them. I 
think you could ask any one of the former "Tonight Show" orchestra musicians 
and find this implication is patently untrue. Not only did I treat them with 
respect, Carson (who made it possible for all of us, including Marsalis and Jay 
Leno) treated the musicians with the utmost personal, professional and 
financial respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Marsalis speaks as though top-notch musical artists only 
discovered the joy of working with "The Tonight Show" band after he arrived. In 
fact, artists of immense talent and diversity discovered the joy of working 
with Carson and his "Tonight Show" band long before Marsalis' arrival: Louis 
Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Placido Domingo, Tony Bennett, the 
Allman Brothers, Yo-Yo Ma, Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand, to name only a 
fraction. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be made clear that these artists were not there to jam with Doc 
Severinsen. They were there to guest with the host of the show, and while I and 
the orchestra were delighted to work with artists of this caliber, they were 
there to appear on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson." The privilege was 
ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis also quoted me as saying " . . . it's not about music around here. 
You just have to put up with this crap and make them pay you enough so that you 
don't mind." Having read Marsalis' take on his role on "The Tonight Show," I 
think he's quoting himself. He's definitely not quoting me. Quite the contrary, 
I always had a great feeling of joyfulness at that job and a great respect for 
it, and was, to the end, grateful to be there. Working for Johnny Carson was an 
honor and standing in front of that band was a privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 At other points, Marsalis suggests that the band was "playing for a wedding." 
I take exception to this. Furthermore, our music was much more than what 
Marsalis suggests was "three inches of sausage" and our "spirit" was not 
"demeaned." These are Marsalis' conflicts. They were never ours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Calendar writer Don Heckman offered the opinion: "Marsalis' 
presence seemed to guarantee an improvement in both the quality and the 
quantity of music on the show." While the quantity of music might at times have 
been in question, I disagree that the quality ever was. 
</P>
<P>
 As a minor point, Marsalis reports, "A couple of guys on the old 'Tonight 
Show' told me, 'Oh, this is the greatest gig ever, man. You go to the golf 
course in the morning, and then you come to work.' " Marsalis' reaction when he 
heard that was to ask, "At what point in your life did you stop being a 
musician?" My question to Marsalis is, at what point in your life did you come 
to believe that a musician (or any human being, for that matter) cannot enjoy 
golf, tennis, horseback riding, automobile racing or any pleasure-inducing 
activity of choice, and not be true to one's own art or vocation? 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, I can only wish Marsalis and his splendid group of musicians the 
best and hope they learn to enjoy the gift as much as we did. We honored the 
tradition of "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" for 30 years, we 
respected what we were doing, and we respected ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad thing to do, by the way.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: VALLEY FOREST BRIGADE DIGS DEEP TO CREATE A LIVING, LEAFY 
LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the people on their knees around here, you'd think a new evangelical 
religion was sweeping the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe one is, but that's not exactly what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
 The people on their knees are getting down and dirty, playing Mr. Green Jeans 
so that there will soon be more leafy, green things rising up out of the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 We've come to expect this sort of behavior from the folks up at the facility 
where Mulholland Drive intersects Coldwater Canyon. The TreePeople are out 
putting down roots somewhere all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area has received grants to 
help renew the 60,000 acres devastated by the Green Meadow and Topanga fires of 
last October. The latest is a $10,000 donation from Kraft Foods' Cool to Care 
About Nature program, which allowed 90 children from Topanga and Balboa 
elementary schools to put the first trees in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's going on in Balboa Park is unusual, a cause for civic pride and 
possibly, emulation. It's a program in which many Valley corporations, their 
employees, employees' families and others are taking considerable pride. 
</P>
<P>
 A small forest of trees has been planted at the northeast corner of the park 
adjacent to Lake Balboa. It's been a four-year project sponsored by the Valley 
Industry and Commerce Assn. and involves the Valley offices of many large and 
small companies, including Texaco Inc., the Gas Co., CableVision Inc., General 
Motors, General Telephone and Health Net. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a popular program," said VICA President Alan Ungar. "It's 
ecological, it's civic-minded, and the people who have given their time and 
money can see the fruits of their efforts growing every day." 
</P>
<P>
 It started in 1990 with VICA members being told about the plan to solicit 
money to build a mini-forest on the Encino property. This was a different kind 
of fund drive, because it was supposed to affect employees personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it worked at TransWorld Bank is that for every dollar the employees 
could raise at our nine Valley branches, the bank would match it. In order to 
raise our $2,500, we gave bake sales and held raffles and asked our customers 
to help out," Elizabeth Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank then put in another $2,500. The combined $5,000 funded about 50 trees 
during the program's four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The special part for Nielsen was visiting the site over the past four years 
and actually seeing work being done with the money she helped raise. "Once a 
year we have brought our shovels out and planted the trees that we have 
purchased," she said. "It's something that really makes you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 The mini-forest now has about 1,000 trees planted on the 80 acres in the 
Sepulveda Basin and the first four-year project is over, with only a pergola 
left to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old boy, after helping with planting, said, "Some day I'd like to 
bring my family here to picnic under these trees." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy is not an employee of one of the VICA businesses or a member of one of 
the members' families. He was invited by VICA and bused to the park for the 
planting by New Directions, a program for troubled youths in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 A junior high school student, he was sentenced to 50 hours of community 
service after being found with a knife in the vicinity of Birmingham High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a stupid thing, and I hope I have learned my lesson," he said. "I want 
to finish high school and go to college, not get sidetracked into joining a 
gang." 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had been sent to Juvenile Hall or some youth camp, I think I would have 
been branded a gangbanger forever. But instead I'm here planting this tree. 
It's a whole different thing," he said, shaking his head, his voice trailing 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the 75 or so people present toiled with a shovel during the tree 
plantings, at least six of those attending chose to use another kind of 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 They included Jake, 12, on banjo; Brittanie, 14, on mandolin; Elisa, 18, on 
guitar, and Katrina, 16, Ashlie, 10, Kinsey, 7, on violins. All are members of 
the Hodges family of La Canada, who strolled around serenading the diggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all pay for their own lessons, doing chores and working outside jobs," 
said their dad, Rick, who added that the youngsters were invited to play for 
the planting when a VICA member saw them at a recent concert in Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still don't sound all that professional," Jackie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree planters dug them anyhow. Eleanor's Gone, but Her Dolls Continue Her 
Good Works 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Gordon, a Northridge artist, was an inveterate thrift store shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "She not only patronized our store, but almost all the thrifts that benefited 
good works," Jill Angel said of Gordon, who died about six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel is the manager of the American Cancer Society's Discovery Shop at 9719 
Reseda Blvd., Northridge, where a special doll and Teddy bear sale is scheduled 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 300 dolls for sale were donated to the shop in Gordon's will. 
</P>
<P>
 "The men with the truck went to her house expecting to find a few dolls 
sitting on a sofa," Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
 What they found was shelf after shelf filled with dolls, covering a wall that 
lined the woman's dining room. Some were five feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such an extraordinary gift to find this magnificent collection," Angel 
said, "that we decided to make the sale a special event." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales people will get into the spirit of the thing by dressing up as their 
favorite dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a wide selection of Teddy bears for sale, including some 
handmade by a local artisan Mariellen Mayberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel said the Discovery Shop is the only thrift store owned and operated by 
the American Cancer Society in the country. Its proceeds go to cancer research, 
as well as countywide patient services, she said. Park Service's Gackenbach Has 
a Charitable Nature 
</P>
<P>
 The next time you need door prizes, you might want to consult David E. 
Gackenbach. 
</P>
<P>
 Gackenbach wheeled and dealed not one, but four, car dealerships into donating 
vehicles for his organization's golf tournament today. 
</P>
<P>
 This mild-mannered persuader heads the local office of the National Park 
Service in Agoura, but maybe his talents are being wasted there and could be 
better used at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States might want to use his skills in redressing the balance of 
trade with some of our allies. Anyone who could talk a Dodge Intrepid, Mustang 
convertible, Thunderbird and Hummer out of four different car dealers, surely 
could talk the Japanese into throwing open their markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Gackenbach is very happy with his current job and with today's 
fund-raising tournament at the Sunset Hills Country Club in Thousand Oaks, 
which benefits several of Gackenbach's favorite charities. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the Education Trust Fund, which provides interest-free college loans to 
students from National Park Service families. The others are the Earthquake 
Victims Assistance Fund, the American Heart Assn. and the Agoura Animal 
Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Be that as it may, one thing is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Those getting a hole in one on the fifth, ninth, 12th or 17th holes in today's 
tournament will be driving more than golf balls. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "Nice try, but I think you are a little young to be suffering from Angst , 
ennui and depression, so go take a bath and clean up your act."

"Generation X grunge" and that bathing didn't suit his image.

WORLD CUP '94: 4 DAYS AND COUNTING; COLOR HIM ENTERTAINING; THE OUTLANDISH 
STYLE OF GOALKEEPER JORGE CAMPOS ADDS FLAIR TO THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the United Soccerphobes of America hunker down behind their living room 
sofas, bracing themselves for a month-long onslaught of strange foreigners with 
no last names, 0-0 ties and a sport that strikes them as nothing more than 90 
minutes of foreplay before the riot, an icebreaker has been sent north across 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Jorge Campos, and he shouldn't be hard to spot. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be the one in the phosphorescent orange togs splashed with yellow, 
green and purple zig-zagging stripes. Or in the neon lime with the lavender and 
canary argyle. Or in the hot pink with swirling pools of gold, violet and 
chartreuse, appearing to be part jockey, part Disney character, part Jell-O 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 He will also be tending goal for Mexico's World Cup team. Occasionally. Most 
of the time, he will be running laps around Mexico's half of the field, jogging 
from the goal mouth to the midfield line and sprinting back again, darting out 
of the box to sweep the ball out to the flank, dashing madly to tackle the ball 
with a perfect figure-4 slide, chasing down a retreating opponent and barking 
at him like a laughing hyena -- sometimes all within the same minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer, sedative of the masses? 
</P>
<P>
 Not the way Campos has taken it and run. He is the official party favor of the 
1994 World Cup, a sparking pinwheel on Cinco de Mayo, your non-boredom 
guarantee every time Mexico steps onto the field during the tournament to come. 
</P>
<P>
 What in the world will Campos do next? 
</P>
<P>
 Freelance Mexico all the way into the Cup semifinals? 
</P>
<P>
 Score a goal on an end-to-end 11-on-10 attack? 
</P>
<P>
 Stray one step too far, let a loose ball skitter past him into the net and 
watch Mexico go down in flames in the first round? 
</P>
<P>
 No one has a clue, and that's the beauty of Campos' game. Half the soccer 
world views him as an improvisational genius who is revolutionizing the sport 
with every step he takes. The other half think he's stark raving loco. But, 
from one moment to the next, neither half can be totally sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, a former surfer from Acapulco, now participates in a sport where he 
supplies the waves. He can take your basic 1-0 yawner and make it pulse with 
excitement, much as he did on June 4 at the Rose Bowl, Mexico versus the United 
States in a World Cup tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos strode onto the grass wearing a florescent orange ensemble strewn with 
wild geometric patterns, a little something he had thrown together for the 
occasion. He looked like a traffic cone. The crowd gasped with delight and up 
in the press box, someone deadpanned, "Darn, I almost wore the same outfit 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 The game began to the killer-bee buzz of several thousand airhorns, and soon, 
the overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd was chanting their hero's name. 
</P>
<P>
 HORRR-HAY!  
</P>
<P>
 HORRR-HAY!  
</P>
<P>
 Campos took his place in front of the Mexican goal, but not for long. It was 
showtime. Saturday afternoon at the Improv. As teammates mounted a rush into 
U.S. territory, Campos began to roam -- first out of the box, then past the 
penalty area, then finally all the way to the midfield circle, where he could 
get a better view of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball turns over and Campos hurries back to the goal mouth, mainly for 
appearance's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 An attacker dribbles down the right flank, readying for a crossing pass -- 
Campos darts 20 yards out of the box to sweep the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.S. pass is squirted left to right in front of the box. Caught out of 
position, Campos catches up to the striker with a full-on sprint and kicks the 
ball away with a fundamentally correct slide into second base. 
</P>
<P>
 If Campos played ice hockey, he'd be Ron Hextall, Robb Stauber. Red Line 
Campos. The happy wanderer, dodging slings and arrows wherever he may meander. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. midfielder John Harkes, just arrived from Europe and not in uniform for 
the game, shakes his head in the press box at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Campos is always flashy," Harkes mutters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were out there today, I'd be shooting at him from the 50-yard line." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, which the U.S. team won, 1-0, on a goal by Roy Wegerle in the 
52nd minute, U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola, a staunch stay-at-home type, is asked 
what he thinks about the Campos free style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great for Mexico," Meola says, "but I don't think it's going to 
work if he has to go to Europe. The same thing that happened to Higuita, you 
know -- you're going to get beat. You just don't play that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's very good for Mexico. There's nobody in the world that can do for 
Mexico what he can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Higuita. There they go again, always dredging up the name of Rene Higuita 
whenever the conversation turns to Campos. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Higuita, a former Colombian goalkeeper, is about the only point 
of reference when it comes to Campos. Like Campos, Higuita was a wide-ranging 
daredevil, but in the 1990 World Cup, he was burned for eternity when he 
misplayed a ball outside the penalty area and lost it to Cameroon's Roger 
Milla, who converted for the goal that eliminated Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos hears about Higuita only as often as he is interviewed. After defending 
him for the first 1,000 questions, Campos now takes the offensive when asked 
about Higuita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope something would happen to me like it did to him," Campos says, 
"because he has already played a World Cup, whereas I have not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Higuita did a very good job in the last World Cup. Everybody 
remembers the mistakes he made, but they don't remember the great plays, the 
great stops. And through time, he has revolutionized the game of soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 If Higuita laid the groundwork, Campos is carrying the baton the next leg. No 
less an authority than Cesar Luis Menotti, coach of Argentina's 1978 World Cup 
champion, calls Campos "the goalkeeper of the 21st century," citing the 
offensive possibilities Campos has created from a defensive position. 
</P>
<P>
 Bora Milutinovic, coach of the U.S. World Cup team, is also an unabashed fan. 
Milutinovic, who once coached the club team Campos plays for, Universidad 
Autonoma de Mexico Pumas, voted Campos second on his 1993 world player of the 
year ballot behind Roberto Baggio of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he likes about Campos, Milutinovic puts it succinctly: 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything." 
</P>
<P>
 After being named U.S. coach in 1991, Milutinovic joked that if Mexico didn't 
want a goalkeeper as unpredictable as Campos, he'd be glad to take the problem 
off their hands. "I don't think he comes so (dangerously) far out," Milutinovic 
says. "This is how the team plays. You build the team around Campos. You have 
the team play as he plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico Coach Miguel Mejia Baron has done just that. Rather than tether Campos 
to his goalpost, Baron encourages the mad forays out of the box. Because Campos 
is small for a goalkeeper -- only 5 foot 9 -- Baron believes he must accentuate 
his greatest strengths, mobility and agility. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does take risks," Baron allows. "We are fully aware of that. But football 
is a game of risks and he has the team's and coach's backing." 
</P>
<P>
 So far the risk has not translated into disaster, although one misstep by 
Campos did prove costly in a January friendly against Bulgaria in San Diego. 
Playing the ball loosely outside the box late in the game, Campos turned it 
over and was forced to foul to prevent an empty-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria converted the resulting penalty kick, the game ended in a 1-1 tie and 
the headlines in Mexico the following morning read: 
</P>
<P>
 "1 GOAL FOR MEXICO, 
</P>
<P>
 1 BLUNDER FOR CAMPOS." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I had some problems," Campos says of the Bulgaria match, "but 
fortunately, that's been the only one, and it happened in a friendly match. 
Fortunately, it hasn't happened in an official game. Hopefully, it never will." 
</P>
<P>
 Campos has been called a "sweeper-keeper" and in the program, he is 
occasionally listed as "Goalkeeper/Forward." He has played both positions 
professionally, sometimes in the same game, which is a little like Troy Aikman 
moonlighting as a defensive tackle during the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Campos broke in with Pumas as a forward in 1989 and actually led the team in 
scoring with 14 goals. He made the move to goalkeeper in 1990 and has stayed 
there ever since, although he still wears the jersey and shorts of a field 
player underneath his goalie's uniform, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 During Gold Cup '93, Campos made several such quick changes. Baron would 
replace him in goal in the second half and move him up front, from where Campos 
assisted on goals against Canada and Martinique. He also hit the post on a shot 
against Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos says it is "my dream to score a goal in World Cup" and thoroughly 
relishes those rare opportunities he is given to mix it up on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goalkeeper has a lot more pressure," Campos has said. "There, one can't 
make a mistake. You can avoid 10 goals and if they put one in on you, they 
forget everything beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forward is the opposite. As an attacker, I feel more free and tranquil." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in his homeland, Campos is a national hero, rivaling boxer Julio Cesar 
Chavez as the most revered athlete in Mexico. Children especially love his 
garish self-designed uniforms. Pint-sized knockoffs of the Campos look were the 
most popular Halloween costume in Mexico last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is coming to the United States, and all of North America could be his 
for the taking. Already, Nike has launched a heavy promotional campaign, 
placing the face of Jorge Campos, rainbow warrior, in television commercials, 
in magazine ads and on a mammoth mural painted on the east side of the 
Hollywood Equitable Building on the corner of Hollywood andVine. 
</P>
<P>
 Some product, this Campos. A soccer player flamboyant enough to even catch the 
wary eye of the American sports fan -- and already gift-wrapped, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the popularity of Jorge Campos is the product of this special 
moment in Mexican football," Campos recently told the Mexican sports magazine 
Deporte Ilustrado. "But everything comes and goes. Everything changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be other players and other teams and hopefully, (Mexican) football 
will have better days ahead. By then, my persona will be left behind and I will 
be forgotten, because that's the way things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't bet your mango-mauve-and-magenta soccer sweater on it.  
</P>
<P>
 World Cup 
</P>
<P>

arrival in the United States for World Cup preparations. Nivea, the facial 
cream manufacturer, threatened Campos with a breach of contract lawsuit when he 
refused to wear gloves with the company's name on them during matches. A civil

MIKE DOWNEY: FREE TYSON? NO, STRIPES UNCHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keep Mike Tyson where he is. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled for a courthouse in Indiana today, at which the 
disgraced former heavyweight boxing champion of the world is to appeal for 
early release from his six-year prison sentence for rape. Mike Tyson, raging 
bully, has never expressed one ounce of remorse for what he did. Until he does, 
don't turn him loose. 
</P>
<P>
 He still doesn't get it. When young Desiree Washington said "no," she didn't 
mean, "I mean, yes." It does not matter whose room it was, what time it was, 
why Washington was there, what anyone was wearing. Tyson cornered her like a 
foe. He overpowered her. 
</P>
<P>
 Overpower him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cus D'Amato, the boxer's long-ago mentor, once gave Tyson a baseball bat as a 
joke gift to fend off all the women who would be begging to be with him. But 
the ex-boxer Jose Torres, who tells this story without glee, also was the one 
who told of Tyson's bloodcurdling attitude toward women, quoting Tyson as 
saying, "I like to hurt women. I like to hear them scream with pain, to see 
them bleed. It gives me pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres asked why. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson told him, "Jose, I am that way and I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he had better know why and he had better know now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson is to speak today on his own behalf. Word is, he will say he has been 
rehabilitated, he will be as sincere as he knows how to be, but he will not 
acknowledge the crime of having sexually assaulted Desiree Washington inside an 
Indianapolis hotel suite. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we take him back, we have to be persuaded that Tyson is not a menace to 
society. We have to know he knows wrong from right. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more urgently, he has to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Givens, the actress once married to Tyson, called him a manic depressive 
in her TV interview with Barbara Walters. Givens said, "It's been torture. It's 
been pure hell. . . . He's got a side to him that's scary. . . . He gets out of 
control, throwing, screaming. . . . Just recently I've become afraid. Very, 
very much afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres once asked the boxer to name the best punch he had ever thrown. Tyson 
said it was at Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really offended me and I went bam. She flew backward, hitting every . . . 
. wall in the apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, this is the same Tyson who once said to an opponent, Razor Ruddock, 
before a 1991 fight, "I'll make you my girlfriend. I'll make you kiss me with 
those big lips." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Tyson's idea of being funny -- i.e., I'll beat you up so badly, 
you'll think you're a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson's corner men have faulted everybody but Tyson. They smudged the 
reputation of the 18-year-old victim. They disparaged the jury for its alleged 
bias and the Marion County prosecutor for his methods. It was implied that the 
judge had no business even hearing the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Fuller, the defendant's original attorney, shamefully presented Tyson 
as someone who, in essence, didn't know any better. Tyson can't even explain 
himself, Fuller suggested. In his opening statement, Fuller said, "He's never 
been trained in public speaking. He's been trained to do one thing, to defend 
himself in a ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller is now off the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his co-counsels, a local Indiana lawyer, has taken charge of the 
appeal. Legal eagle Alan M. Dershowitz, as ever, has been on the lookout for 
technicalities. Associates contend the boxer has been a model example of 
convict conduct. These men want Tyson sprung. 
</P>
<P>
 Not me. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until we know -- until we absolutely know -- that this man has reformed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, author Montieth Illingworth quoted Tyson as saying after his Oct. 
16, 1987 seventh-round knockout of Tyrell Biggs, "I did it very slowly. I 
wanted him to remember it for a long time. When I was hitting him in the body, 
he was making noises. . . . like a woman screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 The writer Joyce Carol Oates attended that fight. She later wrote that Tyson 
fought as though "some hurt, some wound, some insult in his past, personal or 
ancestral, will be redressed in the ring. . . . His grievance has the force of 
a natural catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, this was one angry man. 
</P>
<P>
 He's different now? He's a new man? 
</P>
<P>
 Convince us.

FINALLY, GOAL FOR KEEPERS; SOCCER: THE BEST PLAYERS AT THE POSITION IN THIS 
SUMMER'S COMPETITION, LIKE THOMAS RAVELLI AND BODO ILLGNER, WILL VIE FOR THE 
YASHIN CUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He was known as "The Black Spider." 
</P>
<P>
 He wore black from head to toe: black jersey, black shorts, black socks, black 
boots and black gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Moscow in 1929 and grew up to become one of the Soviet Union's 
most beloved sports figures of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his club debut for Dynamo Moscow in 1951 and his debut for the Soviet 
national team in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 He won an Olympic gold medal in 1956 in Melbourne, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped the Soviet Union win the first European Championship, in France in 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
 He played on Soviet teams that reached the quarterfinals of the 1958 and 1962 
World Cup tournaments and the semifinals of the 1966 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 He represented his country 78 times in international competition and was 
awarded the Order of Lenin and the title Grand Master of Sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, he was voted European player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, when he retired, a crowd of 100,000 gathered at Lenin Stadium in 
Moscow to honor him at a testimonial match between Dynamo and an all-star team 
representing the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he died in 1990, at age 61, he was remembered by soccer fans 
worldwide as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was Lev Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sport such as soccer, which is forever reliving the exploits of its 
heroes, there was little chance that Yashin would ever be forgotten. Now, there 
is no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, world soccer's governing body, has created a new award, the Yashin Cup, 
that will be presented for the first time this summer to the best goalkeeper in 
the 1994 World Cup tournament. Awards already are given to the best player and 
the top goal-scorer, but there has never been one for the player whose job is 
to prevent goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 24 participating teams, there are a number of likely candidates to 
win the Yashin Cup and the honored player will not necessarily be the 
goalkeeper of the World Cup-winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 If the award had existed in 1990, for example, it undoubtedly would have been 
presented to Sergio Goycochea, whose brilliant penalty-saving exploits helped a 
below-average Argentine team advance to the final in Rome. Goycochea will be 
back this summer and, if the two-time Copa America winner can recapture his 
form of four years ago, he is going to be difficult to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 There is talk in the Argentine camp, however, that Goycochea's inconsistent 
form of late might result in Luis Islas winning the starter's role. Coach Alfio 
Basile has yet to announce his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the Germans. As defending world champion, Germany comes into 
the tournament as the second-favorite behind Brazil. But it was only a couple 
of weeks ago that Berti Vogts decided on his first-string keeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's World Cup-winning goalkeeper at Italia '90 was Bodo Illgner. But 
Illgner's fortunes took a turn for the worse at the 1992 European Championship 
in Sweden, where Germany yielded eight goals in five matches and lost to the 
Netherlands in the first round and to Denmark in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts demoted Illgner after the championship match and made Andreas Koepke his 
No. 1 choice. Over the last year, however, Illgner has regained his form and 
the two players have alternated as the starter, with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, a third name has surfaced. Oliver Kahn enjoyed an excellent season in 
the Bundesliga and was voted the best goalkeeper in the league. The 
24-year-old's reward was a spot on the German World Cup team, but his chances 
of starting for the national team lie in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Having to make a choice between Illgner, 27, who has the World Cup experience, 
and Koepke, 32, who is more aggressive and assured, was not a simple task for 
Vogts, and he wrestled with the problem. Finally, two weeks ago, he settled on 
Illgner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most difficult decision that I have ever had to make in my career 
as national team coach," Vogts said. "The deciding factor was that Bodo has the 
experience of being in goal during the 1990 World Cup campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same problem faces Vogts' Brazilian counterpart, Carlos Alberto 
Parreira. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira is the type of coach who stands by the players who have served him 
well in the past. With that in mind, Taffarel would appear to be his 
first-choice goalkeeper. But Taffarel is only the second-choice for his Italian 
club team, Parma, and his national team form has been inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, in the U.S. Cup '93 tournament, Taffarel gave up three goals in 
the second half as Germany came from behind to tie Brazil, 3-3, at Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Copa America tournament in Ecuador, Parreira used three goalkeepers in 
the first round. Taffarel shut out Peru in a 0-0 tie; Carlos was disastrous in 
a 3-2 loss to Chile and immediately was dropped from contention; and Zetti 
defeated Paraguay, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Zetti, a two-time world club champion with Sao Paulo, played against Argentina 
in the quarterfinals and, while he did well to keep the score to 1-1, he was 
nowhere near as adept as Goycochea when the game went to penalty kicks and 
Brazil was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira has yet to make up his mind between Taffarel and Zetti and it could 
come down to who is in better form when Brazil opens its World Cup campaign 
against Russia on Monday. No such worries are troubling Colombia's coach, 
Francisco Maturana. Having decided that 1990's idol Rene (El Loco) Higuita, is 
no longer in his plans, Maturana has placed his faith in Oscar Cordoba. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoba played well in the Copa America tournament in Ecuador and even better 
in the World Cup qualifying matches. If he and Colombia enjoy a good tournament 
this summer, he easily could be in the running to win the Yashin Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible candidate is Mexico's Jorge Campos. Campos is a good and 
capable goalkeeper, but he is prone to making reckless mistakes in his quest to 
be recognized. Against world-class opponents, that could prove costly for 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe, meanwhile has a handful of other top goalkeepers who have been around 
a long time and whose experience makes them likely challengers for the award. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, for instance, Sweden's Thomas Ravelli. Ravelli is noted for his 
intense and angry stare and his constant shouting during matches. Now 34, he 
has been Sweden's first-choice keeper for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Ireland's Pat Bonner, another veteran with vast international 
experience. In the 1990 World Cup in Italy, it was his save of a Romanian 
penalty kick that earned the Irish a place in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another European keeper who should not be overlooked is Italy's Gianluca 
Pagliuca, who comes into the tournament having inherited the No. 1 job from 
Walter Zenga. If he can accomplish what his predecessor, Dino Zoff, did in 1982 
-- that is, win the World Cup -- his status as an Italian hero is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain has a hero in the renowned Andoni Zubizaretta, who has a good shot at 
winning the Yashin Cup if he can recapture the form that made him an idol for 
so long with Barcelona, the club that released him last month after it lost the 
European Cup to AC Milan of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zubi," as he is known, this year became the most-capped Spanish player of all 
time and now has played 86 times for his country. Nevertheless, he dismisses 
such statistics as irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence is a major factor for goalkeepers and you need luck in your early 
games for the national team," he said. "Goalkeeper is one of the positions 
where the fans get used to seeing the same face over a period of many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean he is not interested in joining the select few goalkeepers who 
have played more than 100 international games? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that (the number of appearances) is something for when you retire and 
you can look back and see your name alongside the greats like (England's Peter) 
Shilton, (Germany's Sepp) Maier and (Northern Ireland's Pat) Jennings," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more name: Russia's Lev Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever turns out to be chosen the best goalkeeper of 1994 World Cup cannot 
help but pay tribute to the man in black. 
</P>
<P>

STANLEY CUP FINALS; PRESSURE MOUNTS ON COLLAPSING RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One look at the grim expression worn by New York Ranger Coach Mike Keenan and 
one look at the smiling face of his Vancouver counterpart, Pat Quinn, told the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers sense the Stanley Cup is slipping from their grasp, but they have 
been almost powerless to stop the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Their once-commanding 3-1 series lead has been erased by two convincing 
Vancouver victories, forcing them into a decisive seventh game Tuesday at 
Madison Square Garden. The Canucks, who won Games 1 and 5 in New York, appear 
to be cresting just as the Rangers are hitting bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become better as the series went on," Quinn said. "Maybe it's going to 
be oneof those games where you just lock horns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a game of will on Tuesday. (The series) has brought the 
maximum pleasure a fan could ever want to see in hockey. There's been lots of 
offensive pressure, lots of good hits and two teams that have given really 
intense performances." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he say intense or tense in referring to the Rangers? 
</P>
<P>
 They squandered a chance to end their 54-year Cup famine last Thursday at the 
Garden with a poor third period that gave the Canucks a breath of hope. They 
squandered a chance to win it on the road Saturday, when the Canucks outworked 
them. They've been outscored, 10-4, in the last two games, straying from the 
defense-first style that Keenan called their bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think they're feeling the pressure," Canuck captain Trevor 
Linden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but they say they're not feeling distracted by speculation about 
Keenan's departure. Although on Friday he denied having spoken to the Red Wings 
about becoming their coach or general manager, reports continue to circulate 
that he will abandon the last four years of his Ranger contract, perhaps as 
soon as after Tuesday's game. Keenan won't comment further, and his players 
have too many other things to worry about now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't even been a topic in the dressing room," defenseman Kevin Lowe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One worry is that the Canucks have spread out their scoring since their 
defensemen began joining the rush and since Quinn broke up the Greg 
Adams-Linden-Pavel Bure line. Nine different Canucks have at least one goal, 
while only seven Rangers have scored and a number are prominently missing from 
the scoring action. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Graves, a 52-goal scorer during the season, has no goals in the finals; 
Sergei Nemchinov, Stephane Matteau, Brian Noonan, Esa Tikkanen and Craig 
MacTavish have also been silent. Mark Messier has only one goal. Brian Leetch, 
who had eight points in the first four games, has only one assist in the last 
two games and is minus-five defensively in those games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's paralysis by analysis," MacTavish said Sunday in discussing the Rangers' 
last two losses. "The funny thing is, everybody's coming at it from a different 
angle -- 1940, the travel, we're too old. They just can't accept that we didn't 
play good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tikkanen: "They have a little momentum right now, but we're looking 
forward to a new game. We have to forget what has happened in the past. Now, it 
is the best of one game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks feel they've become more organized defensively in the last two 
games, which has also resulted in better offensive chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've done a better job on Brian Leetch than on Mark Messier," 
forward Murray Craven said. "Brian Leetch is the offensive catalyst for their 
teams. The first few games, he was basically free to roam. We weren't hitting 
him or containing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Containing their anticipation of Tuesday's finale is their most difficult job 
now. "We feel we can go in there and win and spoil their parade and party," 
defenseman Jeff Brown said. "We're very confident and we've dealt with 
adversity well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers overcame adversity in their semifinal series against the Devils 
when Messier rallied them to a victory in Game 6 and Matteau scored the 
double-overtime game-winner in Game 7. "That (experience) helps a little bit, 
and we're confident we can win this one," Leetch said. "You have to stay 
positive. We certainly could be in worse situations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks practiced Sunday at the Pacific Coliseum and were to leave for New 
York today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers took an early flight to New York Sunday and didn't skate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Ranger victory would bring the first title to Madison Square Garden since 
the Knicks' 1973 NBA championship. It might also be the first half of an 
historic double. 
</P>
<P>
 No city's NBA and NHL teams have won titles in the same season, although 
Chicago came close in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls won the NBA title that year, but the Blackhawks lost the Stanley Cup 
finals to the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the Philadelphia Flyers lost the Stanley Cup to the Islanders and the 
76ers lost the NBA finals to the Lakers.

 The Cincinnati Reds are looking into Kevin Mitchell's claim that he was an 
innocent bystander when he was hit in the eye at a prominent local nightspot in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was out of the lineup for a second day because of an injured right 
eye.He had a bandage covering a gash above the eye and swelling around it.

BASEBALL/ DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DREIFORT'S DELIVERY TO BE ANALYZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort's pitching mechanics have deteriorated to the point that 
pitching coach Ron Perranoski is breaking down Dreifort's delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mechanics were so screwed up (Saturday) that we talked it over and we are 
starting from scratch," Perranoski said."The only opportunity I had to work 
with him before was in spring training on the strings. This season, his ball 
moves so much he was able to get away with it. But he has bad angles (which 
results in) no consistency. And once the hitters got to know him and started 
hitting him, he started pressing and became more of a thrower." 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski said the areas Dreifort needs work in are the same he initially saw 
in spring training. He also said he still believes Dreifort can make the 
adjustments at the major league level. 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski said he is also working individually with the other relievers. "It 
may mean they have to sit out a day or two," he said. 
</P>

 Catcher Paul Konerko, the Dodgers' top draft pick, signed a contract with the 
Dodgers worth $900,000 -- not bad for an 18-year old from Chaparral High in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. The signing bonus is believed to be $775,000 and a college 
tuition package to Arizona State valued at $125,000. Konerko batted .578 as a 
senior, with 15 home runs and 56 runs scored. He struck out only four times in 
97 at-bats. He is expected to play for the Dodgers' rookie team at Great Falls, 
which opens its season Friday. . . . Eric Karros' 14-game hitting streak ended 
Sunday. Ryne Sandberg, who is one for 28, was benched for the second 
consecutive day. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SNOW'S DIVE ROBS FIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First baseman J.T. Snow sat with a huge ice pack encasing his bruised right 
bicep, wondering what might have happened if Cecil Fielder's hard-hit, bad-hop 
grounder in the ninth inning Sunday had missed him and gone into right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow flung himself into the ball's path, keeping it on the infield and 
enabling second baseman Rod Correia to hustle over and throw out the 
slow-footed Fielder for the inning's second out. Correia dove at the ball and 
flipped it to pitcher Joe Grahe, who beat Fielder to the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea where the ball was," Snow said. "I was down on the ground and 
the next thing I know Rod's right there. That saved the game right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Correia: "I just knew who was running. I knew Cecil wasn't fast, to put 
it mildly. The ball just hit something and exploded on (Snow). I grabbed it, 
dove and threw it all in one motion." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Trammell then grounded out to end the game with runners on second and 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make your own breaks," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "You don't just sit 
there and hope something good happens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sparky Anderson had these words of advice for Lachemann: 
</P>
<P>
 "Enjoy the good times and learn to live with the bad. And remember that we 
tell our children that if you do the best you can, you've done a good job. And 
you have to live it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Slumps can be rough, Anderson said, but you simply have to fight through them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost 13 in a row, 10 in a row," Anderson said. "(Lachemann) is going to 
suffer. The game is just that way. It's a great game, but it's the cruelest 
game in the world. No one feels sorry for you. When you're going bad, they just 
want to trample you." 
</P>
<P>
 And Anderson had this to say about midseason manager firings: "When a new guy 
takes over, like clockwork, the team will win the first two or three. But if a 
team is losing for a reason, that reason will come back. The players kick 
themselves in the butt to show it's not their fault. And then, whammo, they're 
back to their old ways." ELLIOTT TEAFORD

TYSON SEEKS FREEDOM AGAIN TODAY AT COURT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Tyson pleads again for his freedom today when he appears before a judge 
to ask that his six-year sentence for rape be shortened. 
</P>
<P>
 The former heavyweight boxing champion already has served 26 months of a 
six-year prison term imposed after a Marion County jury convicted him of raping 
a teen-age beauty pageant contestant in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 With time off for good behavior, Tyson is scheduled for release from the 
Indiana Youth Center in May 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Superior Court Judge Patricia J. Gifford said she expects the morning 
hearing to last a half-day. She said she will probably rule quickly on Tyson's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports Illustrated reported that Tyson's attorneys had cut a deal for his 
early release that included a cash settlement with Desiree Washington, who 
filed the rape complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marion County prosecutor's office and Tyson attorney Alan Dershowitz 
issued qualified denials. Washington's attorney firmly denied any deal had been 
reached or was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-page request for a sentence reduction hearing asks for Tyson's 
immediate release, citing his rehabilitation.

BELMONT STAKES; TABASCO CAT HEADED BACK TO CALIFORNIA FOR TRAINING, REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Want a little salad, big boy?" 
</P>
<P>
 With that, trainer Wayne Lukas and one of his grooms, holding a lead shank on 
each side, took a freshly groomed Tabasco Cat from the barn to a large, nearby 
grazing area at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's anything that Tabasco Cat does better than out-kick Go For Gin in 
the stretch of Triple Crown races, it's eat grass. The 3-year-old colt with 
three white stockings even took a Wimpy-sized bite out of a tree limb Sunday, 
despite the efforts of Lukas and the groom to keep his attention on the main 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll chew on that branch, and then spit it out," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's Belmont Stakes was a virtual carbon copy of the Preakness three 
weeks before, with Tabasco Cat coming from off the pace to win and Go For Gin 
finishing second. Go For Gin capitalized on a sloppy track and a ragged start 
by several horses, including Tabasco Cat, to win the Kentucky Derby. Tabasco 
Cat finished seventh at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the New York Racing Assn. had its druthers, there would be a rematch 
between Tabasco Cat and Go For Gin in the Travers at upstate Saratoga in 
mid-August, with Holy Bull tossed into the mix, but it's not likely that the 
best 3-year-olds in the country will tangle until Belmont Park in the fall, or 
at the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Tabasco Cat is going back to California, where Lukas will send him 
to his Santa Ynez farm, about 90 miles north of Los Angeles, for a light 
training program that will get him ready for the Travers. "It's like Club Med 
up there," Lukas said. "This horse came out of the Belmont in perfect shape. 
He's not showing any wear and tear from the Triple Crown races. He's a tough 
rascal." 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin, beaten by three-quarters of a length in the Preakness and two 
lengths in the Belmont, will remain at trainer Nick Zito's Belmont Park barn 
until Saratoga opens in late July. Zito plans to bring his colt back to the 
races in the Forego Handicap, a seven-furlong race for older horses at Saratoga 
in mid-August. Then Go For Gin will run in two Belmont Park races, the Woodward 
and the Jockey Club Gold Cup, before running in the Breeders' Cup Classic at 
Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, who beat older horses handily in the Metropolitan Handicap at 
Belmont last month, was eliminated at the start as the Kentucky Derby favorite, 
then bypassed the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. Trainer Jimmy Croll's immediate 
plans are to run in the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont and then the Haskell at 
Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull is not eligible for the Breeders' Cup, and Croll, who also owns the 
gray colt, would have to pay a penalty of $360,000 before he could run in the 
$3-million Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Zito has now been second in three Belmonts, losing to Go and Go with Thirty 
Six Red in 1990 and finishing a head behind Hansel with Strike the Gold in 
1991. Tabasco Cat gave Lukas his first Belmont victory in eight tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tabasco Cat made his 3-year-old debut, winning the El Camino Real Derby 
at Bay Meadows in January, Pat Day called Lukas and said that he wanted to ride 
the colt. Day had ridden Tabasco Cat twice as a 2-year-old, winning a minor 
stake at Keeneland and finishing third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he hadn't called, we probably would have used a California jockey, 
somebody like (Gary) Stevens or (Chris) McCarron, to ride at Bay Meadows," 
Lukas said. "We sure wouldn't have flown a jockey all the way across the 
country for that race. I wasn't crazy about him, even after he won that stake 
at Keeneland. He probably deserved to be second in the Breeders' Cup, but if 
you had said to me then that this was a Triple Crown horse, I would have said 
that that would be a long stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Belmont, Lukas talked on the phone with his son, Jeff, who's still 
recuperating from near-fatal injuries suffered when Tabasco Cat knocked him to 
the ground after breaking away from his handlers at Santa Anita six months ago. 
The younger Lukas is scheduled to rejoin his father at Santa Anita this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track's fast, dad," said Jeff Lukas, who was watching earlier races on 
the national telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be closer (to Go For Gin) because of that," Wayne Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch the fractions," Jeff Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat'll have all that down," Wayne Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remind Pat not to let Chris (McCarron) steal away (on Go For Gin)," Jeff 
Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Day heard about the conversation. "I'd say that Jeff's back already," the 
jockey said.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / CHRIS FOSTER; RELIEF ROLE SOOTHES CROGHAN'S EGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andy Croghan has gone from being an emotional cripple to a happy camper in 
less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan, who played at Long Beach State and Servite High School, is a feared 
closer for Albany (N.Y.), the New York Yankees' double-A team. He has 10 saves 
and a 1.09 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a lot of fun again," Croghan said. "I come in, throw one inning 
and just let loose. You don't have to pace yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, all he could do was kick himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan was downright depressed at midseason. He was pitching -- or rather not 
pitching -- for Prince William (Va.), a Yankee Class-A team, and there wasn't a 
lot to hum about. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stands were his parents, Fred and Loretta, and his younger brother, 
Brian. Croghan had been demoted from the starting rotation, but couldn't bring 
himself to tell his family about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do," Croghan said "I wasn't happy with being in the 
bullpen. I wasn't too happy with my baseball career. I didn't know if I even 
wanted to play anymore. Nothing was going right." 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan hit rock bottom, then bounced. He got into the game and pitched 3 1/3 
innings, no runs, no hits. 
</P>
<P>
 His family was impressed. More importantly, Yankee Vice President Gene Michael 
was at the game and he had been dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael said I had the potential to be a closer and that's what they were 
going to make me," Croghan said. "Just like that, everything was all right. In 
one game, I went for being awful to having a future." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Croghan about two weeks to adjust to his new role. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan finished with a 5-11 overall record, but 2-1 with 11 saves as a 
reliever, giving him a new mortgage on life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something just clicked," Croghan said. "My mechanics were good and my 
velocity got better. I enjoyed baseball again." 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a relief pitcher has brought Croghan full circle. That was his role 
in high school and his expected role at Long Beach in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan made six relief appearances as a freshman, then was stuck into the 
49er starting rotation. He finished 12-1 with 3.07 ERA. He won two games in the 
West I Regional, including a 10-3 victory over Arizona State that put the 49ers 
in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan was 33-7 in three seasons at Long Beach. The Yankees took him in the 
16th round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was going great," Croghan said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan was 5-4 at Class-A Oneonta (N.Y.) in 1991, but had a lofty 5.63 ERA. 
He was 10-8 at Greensboro (N.C.) with a 4.49 ERA, then the bottom feel out. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 3-10 last season when he was banished to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't tell me what my role would be so I knew I was going to be a 
mop-up guy," Croghan said. "How could I be happy with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 One game later, Croghan was all grins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you who was really glad was my family," Croghan said. "They knew I was 
upset about something. When I told them what Gene Michael had said, they were 
the happiest people in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The happiest? 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I was," Croghan said. 
</P>
<P>

 Ups and downs: Greg Pirkl was shocked at first when the Seattle Mariners sent 
him back to Calgary, Canada, their triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been doing well with the big club. Pirkl was hitting .261 with six home 
runs and 11 runs batted in while platooning at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised when it happened, then I sat down and thought about it," said 
Pirkl, a graduate of Los Alamitos High School. "They needed an 11th pitcher and 
I had to be the one to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Pirkl was the right-handed bat at first base. Tino Martinez, who hit 17 home 
runs in 1993, was the left-hander. Third baseman Mike Blowers, a right-hander, 
then was moved from third to first. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, Pirkl was the only one with options. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew they couldn't lose me," Pirkl said. "I can't become a free agent 
and no team can claim me. Sometimes that's the way things work. The only thing 
I can do is keep a good attitude and try to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Pirkl, The Times player of the year in 1988, hasn't wasted any time. He is 
hitting .297 with seven home runs and 16 RBIs in 18 games at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a little reminder to the Mariners of his abilities. He hit 21 home runs 
and had 91 RBIs at Calgary last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he watched as others were called up by the Mariners. When Marc Newfield 
was promoted, Pirkl turned a little sour. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they called Marc up, it was a shock," Pirkl said last season. "I was a 
little upset. But I just tried to trust whoever was in charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Pirkl did get called up after Martinez was injured. His first home run was off 
Angel pitcher Mark Langston. But Pirkl hit only .174 in four games and was sent 
back to Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a valuable lesson that keeps him from being too impressed with his 
numbers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I was hitting OK up there, but I don't think you prove yourself until 
you do it over an entire season," Pirkl said. "Who knows what would have 
happened? I could have gone 0 for 50 or 50 for 50. It could have gone either 
way." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 State of Staton: Dave Staton is trying to recover from his brief stint with 
the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Staton, plagued by injuries and illness throughout his career, couldn't find a 
cure for his anemic .182 batting average. So it was back to Las Vegas, the 
Padres' triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 He is on the mend now. Staton, who played at Tustin, Orange Coast College and 
Cal State Fullerton, is five for 12 (.417) in six games with Las Vegas.

AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY, DISARCINA GOES TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina got a rest Saturday night, his first day off since April 25 and 
only the second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent much of Sunday afternoon sprinting around the basepaths, diving 
headlong into the dirt down the left-field line in pursuit of foul pops and 
sliding into second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came into the clubhouse with a little more energy today," DiSarcina said. 
"It's nice to be able to sit back and relax and just watch a game for a change. 
You get a different perspective. Sometimes we tend to make this game more 
difficult than it really is." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, DiSarcina made it look like just another Sunday stroll in the 
ballpark. Refreshed and rejuvenated, he drove in a career-high three runs with 
a single, a double and a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to see," said Manager Marcel Lachemann, who could smile after the 
Angels snapped a three-game losing streak with an 8-6 victory over Detroit. 
"Sometimes all you need is a day away to clear out the cobwebs. This is a tough 
business and you need to find a way to get these guys a rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, and Buck Rodgers before him, have been understandably reluctant to 
bench their defensive anchor, and DiSarcina's recent emergence as an offensive 
force has made it that much more difficult to fill out the lineup card without 
writing "DiSarcina, SS," at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel shortstop has put punch at the No. 9 spot in the order. He is off to 
his best start on offense. His average hovered around .300 for the first two 
months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfair for Timmy (Salmon) and Chili (Davis) to have the responsibility 
of driving in all the runs," DiSarcina said. "If the guys lower in the order 
can scratch out a few runs here and there, it makes it a lot easier for them, 
the pitching staff, a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, DiSarcina had been struggling to carry that self-imposed 
weight. And his average was a season-low .285 after going nine for 59 before 
Sunday. There was a time he was satisfied to hit .240 and scoop up every ground 
ball, but those days are history. 
</P>
<P>
 He already has three homers, nine doubles, 34 runs and 24 RBIs this year and 
will bring a .294 average into Kansas City today. The last two seasons, he has 
averaged three homers, 20 doubles, 46 runs and 44 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the work I've done with Rod (Carew, Angel hitting instructor) the past 
two years is paying off and now I know I can do better than settling for .240," 
DiSarcina said. "I think I have the opportunity to finish this season the way 
it started." 
</P>
<P>
 A few more afternoons like this will go a long way toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth inning, he homered to left off Phil Stidham after Chris Turner 
had tripled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had left a lot of guys on base the last couple of weeks," he said, "and I 
wasn't really contributing. So I was trying to hit a fly ball, well, actually I 
was just trying to hit it. He left a changeup up and I was able to get around 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, he sent a slicing line drive down the right-field line and when 
the ball took a hop away from Junior Felix, DiSarcina kept going to second. He 
scored on Chad Curtis' single to right. And he drove in his third run of the 
day in the eighth with a single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the difference a day off makes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ego is not big enough to want any Cal Ripken streaks," DiSarcina said. 
"When it's time for a rest, it's time for a rest."

GRADUATES CELEBRATE WITH MASS; RELIGION: SERVICE IN SANTA ANA MARKS 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF LATINO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE OVERCOME 
ADVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Three years ago, Fabiola Orozco wasn't sure she would ever graduate from high 
school. Raised in Mexico, the youngster had trouble speaking English, was 
tempted to neglect her studies and felt a huge cultural gap between herself and 
her more Americanized peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a lot to overcome," Elizabeth Orozco, the young woman's mother, said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But overcome she did. This year, Fabiola, 18, was homecoming queen at 
Saddleback High School. And in two days she will graduate from Saddleback with 
a 3.25 grade point average. 
</P>
<P>
 "It proves that faith can conquer all," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabiola was one of about 150 graduating seniors from Santa Ana's five high 
schools to attend a special baccalaureate Mass at St. Anne's Church on Sunday. 
Its purpose, organizers said, was to celebrate the students' accomplishments in 
graduating, help emphasize education and urge the youngsters to rely on their 
faith to bolster them against all obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you prepare for life in the world, remember that you are men and women of 
faith," Bishop Michael Driscoll, the Diocese of Orange auxiliary bishop, told 
the worshipers after offering them Communion. "If you are ever asked the 
question 'where is God?' you should know the answer; God is with you ." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the Rev. Jaime Soto, vicar for the Hispanic community: "I'm sure there 
were times you thought it would be impossible to get to this day. Days of 
darkness and days of great loneliness. But the times when it was dark, God 
wanted to be your light and in times of loneliness he wanted to walk with you." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Soto, the annual event was started by the church last year as 
part of an effort to help Santa Ana make education a priority. With the 
increasing pressure on today's students to join gangs, take drugs or otherwise 
get in trouble, he said, it is important to recognize those who successfully 
manage to resist such temptations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All young people are surrounded by temptations," Soto said after Sunday's 
service. "The ability to persevere in school demands a heart that is firmly 
rooted in the promise that God holds out to them." 
</P>
<P>
 That promise seemed to be reflected in some of the students' bright eyes and 
smiles Sunday as, dressed in suits and dresses, they recited prayers and 
listened to a group of their peers play guitars and sing songs in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, while some of the students stood in line for Driscoll to autograph 
their programs, others strolled over to the parish hall for a reception 
featuring loud music, cookies and punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought (word) to a lot of seniors to keep up the fight against violence 
and trouble in the street," graduating senior Peter Regalado, 19, said of the 
service. "I felt my spirit coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 Concluded Fabiola Orozco, who hopes to become a psychologist: "I wanted to be 
here with my family and friends to thank God that I made it."

ENJOYING A LICKING; ICE CREAM TRUCK'S JINGLE SPURS SWEET MEMORIES -- AND WOW, 
WHAT A JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pssst . Kid. Want to slurp a Tyrannosour? How about a Drumstick? A Bomb Pop? A 
Choco-Taco, Push-Up, Eskimo Pie? 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Schimmel is your guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, you've probably seen him. Or heard him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the Ice Cream Man, the dude with the long, reddish hair and black shades 
who rumbles around this seaside city in his white truck with the faded, peeling 
Popsicle stickers on the side. The one who bounces into parking lots to the 
jangling ice cream truck standard, "Pop Goes the Weasel." 
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel, 41, who has been selling frozen deserts to Orange County children 
for eight years, is again entering ice cream's prime season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Utopia. Nirvana. Heaven," Schimmel pronounced on a recent hot 
afternoon, cruising south on Pacific Coast Highway in his ice cream-mobile. 
"Look at that ocean. Is this what it's all about or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel drives from his home in Santa Ana to the nearby Tropical Ice Cream 
Co. seven days a week to pick up his truck and buy cones and sweets. He gets 
lollipops, bubble gum cigarettes and other candy at warehouse stores. 
</P>
<P>
 After loading his truck, he heads south on the San Diego Freeway to San 
Clemente. His route, a prized one, was granted to him years ago by a friend who 
left the business.  
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel has a strategy for selling his frozen concoctions. He coasts by 
industrial parks in the early afternoon to sell to employees after their lunch 
breaks. ("Just when they want dessert, heh!") Then he drives by residential 
areas and parks to attract children during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a rolling store," Schimmel said. "I truly deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 About half the ice cream sold all year in the United States will be dished out 
in the next four months; about half of that will be purchased at supermarkets. 
But on a recent afternoon, Schimmel had no problem locating eager customers. 
</P>
<P>
 As he crept up a hill at the start of his route, he spied a hefty man standing 
outside a computer plant, eyeing his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohh, this guy's really into it," Schimmel said. "Yeah, he's gonna buy a 
couple ." 
</P>
<P>
 The man sauntered to the truck. "Hey, Ice Cream Man," he said. "Whatcha got?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel plunged his hand into a steel cooler encrusted with ice and pulled 
out a round ice cream sandwich. "UFOs, man," Schimmel said, slowly passing it 
before the man's eyes. "These just landed this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhhhhh," the customer said, plunking down a buck. Schimmel crumpled the 
dollar and tossed it at a small cardboard box filled with coins and bearing the 
words: Candy is delicious food. Eat some every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road at a Hobie sunglasses plant, he sold Pepsis to a few technicians 
he calls "the soccer guys." They fixed his glasses in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner, he pointed out a large dent in a garage door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did that when I passed out in my truck," he said. In January, Schimmel 
said, he was taken to Mission Hospital, where doctors discovered he had a 
congenital heart defect and replaced a valve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a new start and I'm just happy to be alive."  
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Joplin, Mo., Schimmel says little about his past, giving details 
parsimoniously. "I've had my wild times," he said. "I've been there, done 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel started selling ice cream in 1983, in Los Angeles, after losing his 
janitorial business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed a job. Now it's turned into a monster. The people, the interaction, 
I just can't leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, he remembered, he got lost driving his truck in Los Angeles and ended up 
in Norwalk, outside a gigantic children's party. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were like a hundred kids and they just kept coming and coming ," 
Schimmel said.  
</P>
<P>
 And then came his dream day, when he could do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like everybody who looked at me wanted ice cream," he said. "Like 
they were stopping their cars and getting out. Wow." 
</P>
<P>
 He rents his truck for about $150 a week, which goes up to about $200 a week 
in the summer. After buying the ice cream and candy, he keeps what he makes -- 
an amount that he won't reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 There are advantages to the job, he said: meeting people, independence and no 
rules. It's better than past jobs in a chicken processing plant or in plumbing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On one block of his route, he pointed out the home of an elderly resident and 
longtime friend. On another, he stopped to see how a man who broke his ankle in 
a motorcycle accident was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 When one of his customers had only 60 cents, not enough for a $1.25 Drumstick, 
Schimmel accepted a three-foot-tall, green Gumby doll as collateral. ("I will 
keep it if he doesn't pay," he said with a laugh.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even San Clemente's canine population, with names like Bogie, Chopper and 
Barkley, know him. Schimmel turned into an empty cul-de-sac and waited, his ice 
cream tunes churning. "Watch this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A golden retriever bolted into the street and planted its paws on the truck's 
serving counter. Schimmel tossed him the expected dog biscuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But everybody's favorite ice cream man, the same man who listens to "Pop Goes 
the Weasel" umpteen times a day, does have another ambition: to become a 
full-time musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel, who taught himself piano in his family's garage, is cutting an 
"alternative folk" album with studio musicians. He also is getting his younger 
customers involved, running an art contest to garner a picture for the album 
cover. The name of the group? "Ice Cream Man."

CANCER PROGRAM HEAD IS PREVENTION PIONEER; MEDICINE: DR. FRANK MEYSKENS HAS 
MADE UCI A LEADER IN AN EMERGING FIELD OF RESEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ahead of his time a decade ago when he studied the cancer preventive powers of 
vitamin A, Dr. Frank L. Meyskens Jr. remembers with mischievous delight a talk 
he gave back then to a group of cancer therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the talk, one guy in all innocence says, 'You're doing this 
prevention stuff until we have a cure, right?' " he recalled. "I said, 'No, 
wrong. My intention is to put you out of business.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now the head of UC Irvine's cancer program, the 48-year-old Meyskens has made 
the university a leader in the emerging field of cancer prevention research. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Peter Greenwald, director of cancer prevention and control at the National 
Cancer Institute in Maryland, calls Meyskens "a real visionary" who has risked 
the less traveled road. 
</P>
<P>
 While mainline medicine was using toxic chemotherapy to treat cancer, Meyskens 
bet his scientific reputation that more benign chemicals -- some naturally 
occurring like vitamin A -- might prevent cancer by stopping or reversing 
molecular changes that lead to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 His faith in chemoprevention has begun to be confirmed by research studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in April published 
the results of a 15-year study, of which Meyskens was the principal author, 
that showed a drug similar to vitamin A can reverse precancerous conditions of 
the cervix.  
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Meyskens' scientific acclaim was overshadowed by news that, 
under his leadership, UCI is on the verge of obtaining special recognition by 
the National Cancer Institute that would make it one of the top five cancer 
centers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 By summer's end, UCI will probably become an NCI "clinical cancer center," a 
designation that may bring up to $2.4 million in federal grant money to the 
university over three years and enable it to attract more cancer researchers, 
physicians and patients seeking state-of-the-art medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The prestigious designation is a necessary step toward UCI's ultimate goal of 
becoming an NCI "comprehensive cancer center," which would give it even loftier 
status among scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 A workaholic who needs little sleep, he works some 70 hours a week on his 
multifaceted job, according to his staff, dividing his time between 
administrative tasks, teaching, research and patients.  
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens, who rises at 4 a.m., confesses to having slowed his pace a tad since 
a sudden attack of diabetes last summer sent him to the intensive care unit at 
UCI Medical Center. After that scare, he started taking insulin, monitoring his 
sugar level and wearing a medic alert bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the credit for UCI's fast track admission to the NCI cancer 
pantheon goes to Meyskens, who was recruited from the University of Arizona 
five years ago to develop an NCI-class cancer center, colleagues say. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the plaudits, Carol Schwartz, Meyskens' secretary, said that when 
friends stop to congratulate him, he refuses the compliments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the most humble individuals I have seen in my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And his preoccupation with intellectual pursuits and lack of pretentiousness, 
friends say, are evidenced by his rumpled look. Meyskens, who earns $250,000 a 
year at UCI, attributes his inattention to clothes to his blue-collar 
background as "the son of a plumber." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, friends say, his mind is sharp and he has a voracious appetite 
for scientific reading. "Only a handful of people in the country know as much 
about cancer prevention," said Dr. Thomas Ahlering, a urological oncologist 
whom Meyskens recruited to UCI from the City of Hope National Medical Center. 
"He is not driven by fame or finances. He seems driven by the scientific 
endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens has the rare ability to communicate as clearly to a scientific 
gathering as to a group of Leisure World retirees, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Meyskens speaks the professional lingos of both medicine and basic 
research, a skill that has helped him bridge the gap that once separated UCI 
physicians from scientists. Retreats have been his favorite tools to bring the 
two groups together to share ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He encouraged people to talk and work together, to become a center," said 
Hoda Anton-Culver, director of cancer epidemiology intervention, a component of 
the center. "Before, each investigator worked by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Such cooperation was important to gaining recognition from the NCI, which 
insists that its centers develop interdisciplinary research programs that 
transfer laboratory research into clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 When Meyskens arrived at UCI, he found that basic biological and molecular 
research was strong but clinical research was not a high priority for its 
physicians. That is changing. While clinicians were receiving only $192,000 a 
year in research grants five years ago, they are now garnering about $2 million 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus now has one of the nation's most ambitious clinical cancer research 
programs in chemoprevention, studying how chemicals -- such as vitamin A, beta 
carotene and tamoxifen -- protect people at high risk for various forms of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recruited leading research talent to UCI. Among the biggest coups were 
Ahlering, Dr. Jeffrey Webber, formerly a senior investigator at the National 
Cancer Institute, and Dr. Paul Zeltzer, a pediatric oncologist from UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens also promoted fund-raising to support the cancer program, which has 
raised $26 million, the most since he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to increase the visibility of the cancer program in the community," 
said Ann Siemens, the cancer program's director of development. "He got our 
doctors, nurses and basic researchers talking to traditional donors and even 
patients who became donors." 
</P>
<P>
 All this was done with little fanfare by the unassuming man who hung the sign 
"grantmaster," a present from his three children, inside his office door so it 
would not offend anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a director, you really have to bury your ego as much as possible and put 
everyone else out front," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens became interested in medicine as a child, having been born with an 
incapacitating brain disorder that caused him to suffer severe seizures.  
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a good portion of my life between the ages of 3 and 10 in the 
hospital," he said. "My earliest childhood memory was sitting in bed with all 
these white coats around me with my mother crying in the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens ultimately outgrew this medical problem, but the confinement 
encouraged him to turn to books and science. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended UC San Francisco Medical School and during a 1968 summer job at 
the University of Cambridge met Francis Crick, a co-discoverer of DNA. The 
relationship ignited his interest in microbiology.  
</P>
<P>
 After training at the National Cancer Institute, he took a position at the 
University of Arizona in 1977, where he organized cancer prevention studies. He 
also played a role in that school's developing its NCI cancer center in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for his research in the last 15 years into melanoma and 
chemoprevention of cancer, Meyskens traces those interests to his father's eye 
cancer. After diagnosing melanoma in his father, he began reading reports of 
laboratory experiments using vitamin A derivatives to treat the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Philip DiSaia, who helped to recruit Meyskens to UCI, said Meyskens' 
background suited him to the task of building another NCI cancer center. 
Moreover, he felt Meyskens' focus on cancer prevention is a better approach to 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "the new road," DiSaia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been struggling 34 years trying to kill cancers once they are 
established and have been only moderately successful. Seems to me it is a lot 
more logical to try to prevent them."

YOUTH INJURED IN FALL AT MONORAIL; DISNEYLAND: PASSENGER SURGE REPORTEDLY 
CAUSES HIM TO TUMBLE FROM PLATFORM AT HOTEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old youth was injured early Sunday when he fell 20 feet from a 
monorail platform at the Disneyland Hotel in the first serious accident since 
the train ride opened in 1959, according to a Disneyland official. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, Edward Paolello of Santa Maria, was transported to UCI Medical 
Center immediately after the 12:30 a.m. fall. He was listed in fair condition 
with a shattered right elbow, a fractured left wrist and a hairline fracture of 
his pelvis, said Karen Wucetich, a hospital supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolello, who had been staying at the hotel with friends, was apparently 
accidentally pushed over a short wall and off the platform by a surge of 
passengers as they left the monorail, said his mother, Sylvia Paolello. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager landed on a concrete parking area near the entrance to the 
hotel, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had just gone through the turnstile and looked back to see his friend," 
said Paolello, 42, a home health aid. "He didn't realize the change in the path 
and he wound up falling over the wall. He was so lucky, so lucky he wasn't more 
seriously hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Paolello's fall was the second at the park within the past two months. On 
April 17, a Highland man suffered minor injuries when he fell from a Skyway 
gondola and landed 20 feet below in a tree at the Alice in Wonderland ride. 
</P>
<P>
 In a short statement, Disneyland officials said the Sunday incident was under 
investigation. Spokeswoman Pam Espinosa added that this was the first serious 
accident since the Monorail was built at the park in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager had spent the day in the park with several friends and all were 
together as they left the train at the hotel platform, Sylvia Paolello said. 
The girls in the group looked back at Edward and saw him fall, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolello said her son is big for his age -- 6 feet 1 inch tall and about 225 
pounds -- and she speculated that his size may have contributed to the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just fell over. Anybody else the wall might have stopped," said Paolello, 
who drove to the hospital from Santa Maria after being notified of the 
accident.

 Rene Hurtado had just walked back to her car Saturday night after making a 
quick purchase at a convenience store. Waiting for her in the car were her 
18-month-old daughter, her sister-in-law, and her niece, also 18 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado's daughter had been fussy and crying. Climbing into the driver's seat, 
Hurtado, 22, turned and picked up her daughter to try to quiet her before 
driving away. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, a man Los Angeles police believe to be a gang member began 
shooting at a group of rival gang members across the parking lot of the 
mini-mall near Plummer Street and Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the men who apparently were the intended targets was injured, police 
said, but one of the bullets pierced the windshield of Hurtado's car, striking 
her in the chest and barely missing her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado's sister-in-law, Brenda Wong, drove her to Holy Cross Medical Center 
in Mission Hills, where Hurtado, of Panorama City, was pronounced dead at 10:25 
p.m., said Van Nuys Division Sgt. Harry Rosenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong and the two toddlers were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman was holding her daughter and the bullet apparently just missed the 
little girl," Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police could provide little information about Hurtado on Sunday. Family 
members gathered at Wong's North Hills apartment on Sunday but declined to 
discuss the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfeld said police spoke to a witness at the scene and have a description 
of the gunman. Police on Sunday suggested they may have have identified a 
suspect, but would not release additional information. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Haddad, the owner of Regal Liquor Market and Deli, said he heard about 10 
gunshots after Hurtado left his store Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "First there was about five shots, and then I heard another five shots," 
Haddad said Sunday. In the parking lot in front of his store, the only visible 
sign of the shooting was broken glass where Hurtado's car had been parked. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad, who opened his store about three years ago when the mini-mall opened, 
said gang members do not usually hang around in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a man who was buying cigarettes at the store said there is a gang in 
the neighborhood. He said the mini-mall is known by residents as a place where 
drugs are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad said that after making her purchase and going to her car, Hurtado 
returned to the store to get change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if she hadn't come back for change, she would have left before the 
shooting started and she wouldn't have been shot," he said.

TRYING TO TAME A ROWDY ROAD; GATE PROPOSED FOR DUSTY STRIP OF MULHOLLAND, A 
FAVORITE SPOT FOR DIRTY DEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the crest of the Santa Monica Mountains, high above the floor of the San 
Fernando Valley, is a six-mile stretch of Mulholland Drive where the smooth 
pavement of modern city streets ends and a dusty, winding dirt road begins. 
</P>
<P>
 This also is where the trouble begins. 
</P>
<P>
 After sunset, the road becomes a haunt for rowdy teen-agers, displaced lovers, 
car thieves, murderers and just about anybody else looking for a remote spot in 
which to do their dirty deeds away from the gaze of street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a natural attraction for them," said Capt. Val Paniccia of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, commanding officer of the West Valley Bureau, which 
shares patrol duties there with mountain rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The road also has gained popularity as an illegal dumping site for 
construction materials, furniture, trash, stolen cars and, on one occasion, the 
body of a man executed after a dispute with two fellow burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 Such problems have prompted Paniccia, city officials, neighbors and 
environmentalists to back a plan to install gates on the unimproved section of 
road to keep out vehicles at night and during brush-fire season and heavy 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The section of road that would be gated is adjacent to property owned by the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the Department of Water and Power and the 
state Department of Parks and Recreation. No private homes would be included in 
the blocked-off area. 
</P>
<P>
 The gate plan was considered by a committee of the City Council last month, 
but a decision was delayed to give city officials time to adopt a formal policy 
for street closures citywide. The committee discussion has been rescheduled for 
June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one believes that the gates will put a complete end to the late-night 
mischief, police and others hope the gates will dissuade those who may be 
reluctant to enter the secluded road on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 For police, Mulholland Drive does not constitute the biggest crime problem in 
the San Fernando Valley. They estimate that they respond to calls there an 
average of twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably a majority of the people that go up there are law-abiding citizens," 
said LAPD Officer Steve Kegley, whose beat includes the mountain road. "But the 
problem is those few teen-agers who go up there to smoke and party at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, to neighbors and conservancy officials, the problem is serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Avi Handelman, who lives off Mulholland Drive near Saltillo Street, where the 
unimproved section starts, called the gate plan a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sat on his porch looking over the road, he said there have been many 
weekend nights that he has heard the squeal of wheels in front of his home and 
found empty beer bottles and cans strewn along the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But his biggest worry is that someone will accidentally start a brush fire 
that could threaten his home. "Somebody throws a lit cigarette and that is the 
end of the story," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy shares that concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservancy believes that the temporary closure will greatly curtail 
inappropriate and undesirable use of the parks in the Mulholland Corridor," 
Belinda Faustinos, the conservancy's deputy director, said in a letter to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no serious fire has been started from the road, Los Angeles Fire 
Department Capt. John Gregory said he would rather not push his luck by leaving 
the road open at night and during brush-fire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to see it closed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dirt section is a far departure from the paved portion of Mulholland Drive 
known for its expensive homes and manicured gardens. On the unimproved stretch, 
nature dictates all the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is part of the city's street system, the unpaved portion has no 
lights and is lined only by huge crevices and jutting rocks, giving it the 
appearance of a back road in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, the brush-lined road is a scenic byway for joggers, bicyclists 
and hikers looking for a cardiovascular workout and an escape from the tense, 
traffic-choked life in the Valley below. 
</P>
<P>
 On any day, a visitor is likely to come upon a cottontailed rabbit scurrying 
across the road or a stringy lizard doing a herky-jerky dance over the dusty 
ground. Hawks circle above, searching for prey in the tall, dry grass and 
sagebrush below. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tranquillity fades with the sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complain that at night, the canyons often echo with the sound of 
gunfire and what they believe to be cries for help. Street maintenance crews 
are called almost monthly to clean up illegally dumped trash, scrap lumber, 
chairs and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious crime recently reported in the area was the murder of a man 
whose body was left on a fire road near Mulholland Drive. Investigators said 
the man was executed by two partners in a burglary who were angry with him 
after a dispute over the division of profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The two burglars were convicted of the murder and are currently serving life 
terms in prison, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not everyone is thrilled with the idea of blocking off the road. Two 
gray-haired men in shorts and sun hats began to debate the idea as they 
finished their daily stroll on the road on a recent weekday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 One argued that the gates are a good idea because they would keep out teen-age 
lovers and the "cowboys in their four-wheel-drive trucks." 
</P>
<P>
 His walking partner pooh-poohed the idea, saying that what was really needed 
was increased police patrols. "What is going to stop a kid?" he asked 
rhetorically. "If kids want to do something, they'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Up the dirt road a stretch, Jean Finley of Woodland Hills walked her two 
terriers, Daisy and Ernest. She said the gates might reduce the quantity of 
trash and car parts that is dumped on her favorite walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad because you walk along and see a pile of rubbish on the road," she 
said as she struggled to keep the dogs from pulling their leashes out of her 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But Finley understands why the road attracts so many visitors. "Hey, it's 
Mulholland Drive," she said. "It's the view." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the road, driving down a hill in a cloud of dust, was perhaps the 
most knowledgeable source about Mulholland Drive, Kenn Hughes, a Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy ranger assigned to the unimproved roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said he has seen it all -- stolen vehicles, late-night bonfires and 
illegal trash dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, he saw a combination of the three when someone dumped a stolen 
car over the edge of the road and set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came around the corner and the whole side of the hill was on fire," 
Hughes said. The blaze was doused by fire officials before it threatened nearby 
homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem that really irks Hughes is the illegal dumping of rubbish because 
part of his job is to cruise Mulholland Drive, shovel all the trash into the 
back of his truck and haul it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just take off my shirt, grab a shovel and get to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes estimates that he spends at least one day a week cleaning up the dumped 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Near a trailer where Hughes and other rangers are stationed, alongside the 
road was a faded mattress, a cabinet, a tattered love seat and piles of 
shredded roof tiles, gravel and branches -- the latest accumulation of 
illegally dumped junk. A city crew was expected to haul the stuff away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dumping is the big thing right now," Hughes said, driving off in a cloud of 
dust.

BACKLOG OF NEEDED ROAD REPAIRS IS MOUNTING; TRANSPORTATION: DOZENS OF 
IMPROVEMENTS ARE DELAYED DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS. OFFICIALS SAY PROBLEMS IGNORED 
TODAY MAY MEAN BIG TROUBLE IN FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Each day, motorists crawl down torn-up California 118 through Saticoy, sitting 
in stalled traffic as road crews labor to complete a project launched more than 
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, commuters inch along the Moorpark Freeway, narrowed to one 
lane in each direction so that workers can roll fresh asphalt onto off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 These traffic tangles will end with the completion of both projects, scheduled 
later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But traffic is increasing throughout the county, adding strain to the area's 
aging road system, which county transportation leaders don't have the funds to 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this year, more than 100 miles of worn-down roadways throughout 
Ventura County will go unrepaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects to widen dozens of jammed intersections will be delayed and plans to 
install scores of stoplights postponed. Streets identified as among the most 
congested in the county may languish for 30 years or more before money to fix 
them becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county's infrastructure may appear mostly trouble-free to the 
average motorist, transportation experts warn that cracks and traffic snarls 
barely noticeable today are the harbingers of more serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials warn that it is becoming increasingly difficult to 
maintain aging road systems as public transit programs are poised to compete 
for an already limited pool of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 They predict that even with careful planning, traffic is going to get worse 
before it gets better. 
</P>
<P>
 About 144,000 vehicles a day crossed the county line east of Thousand Oaks on 
the Ventura Freeway in 1989, the last time the state counted traffic there. By 
2010, that number -- which includes traffic into and out of the county -- will 
jump to 199,000, according to the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has done a good job of controlling growth, so congestion here 
is not as bad as in other parts of Southern California," said Chris Stephens, a 
planner for the Ventura County Transportation Commission. "The problem is that 
even with limited future growth, we're going to see an increase in cars on the 
road and all of the problems that brings." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 20 years, Ventura County's population has nearly doubled and 
traffic has increased even more. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 to 1990, the number of miles driven each day in Ventura County 
jumped 61%, according to Caltrans. Over the same period, the number of new 
miles of roadway increased by 8% and funding for transportation inched up just 
3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, four years ago, the state took control of millions of dollars in 
fines and forfeiture fees that cities depended on to boost their road revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be when our Police Department arrested a drunk driver, we could 
count on $1,000 in fines that would go right to roads," said Norm Wilkinson, 
Santa Paula's director of public works. "Now all we get is the bill for the 
booking fee, and the city streets wait another year." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 60 streets in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo 
and Port Hueneme must be widened or repaved to avoid increased congestion, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most city and county officials say they don't have enough money for 
repairs, let alone road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are basically hanging on by our teeth," said Art Goulet, the county's 
public works director. "We look at all of the projects that need doing, and 
then we put most of them off for another year." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet prolonged delays can cause the costs of repair to skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick patch job on a mile of damaged roadway costs about $80,000. If the 
work is postponed and the problem worsens, the costs of completely stripping 
and repaving that same stretch runs about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is we will get to a point where the roads are so bad that a few 
patches are not going to do the trick," Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani 
said. "We are going to wind up with major road repair projects on our hands and 
no money to fix them." 
</P>
<P>
 As for highways, a financial crisis at Caltrans will likely force delays in 
planned projects throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans announced in August that unless the funding picture improves, many 
projects planned for construction after 1995 will have to be downsized, delayed 
or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a statewide crunch, which means everybody is going to 
suffer," said Jerry Baxter, director of Caltrans District No. 7, which includes 
Ventura and Los Angeles counties. "For Ventura County, it might mean some 
projects don't get done." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, a planning document called the State Transportation Improvement 
Program provided a detailed blueprint of all the major highway and rail 
projects to be undertaken by Caltrans over a seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the Transportation Commission has listed the top 15 highway 
projects. Seven are included in the Caltrans blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, projects on the list were virtually assured of being 
completed. Now, a decline in state gas tax revenue and federal funding means 
that the future of those projects is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the jeopardized projects are the widening of the Ventura Freeway from 
Vineyard Avenue to Johnson Drive, the construction of a new Seaward Avenue 
bridge and the widening of the Moorpark Freeway from Moorpark to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond the first few projects on the list, it's really a wish list," Stephens 
said. "It's hard to say when we'll be able to tackle many of those projects." 
</P>
<P>
 A project to widen California 33 through Casitas Springs is scheduled for the 
year 2023. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be in for some very long waits," said Ginger Gherardi, 
executive director of the county's Transportation Commission. "And the costs 
are just going to keep going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the concern are new state and federal regulations that require 
counties every two years to evaluate congestion levels and submit plans to 
reduce traffic tie-ups or risk losing millions of dollars in transportation 
funding. Ventura County stands to lose up to $6.2 million a year if it fails to 
submit the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congestion Management Plan provides the county with a standardized way to 
measure traffic levels and the impact of new development on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, roads throughout the county are graded, like schoolwork, on an 
A-through-F system. A's are granted to perfectly free-flowing roads and Fs to 
poorly functioning areas that suffer rush-hour traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent plan, completed in December, gives flunking grades to six 
spots throughout the county and assigns dates for fixing the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem spots are California 33 through Casitas Springs, the Ventura 
Freeway at Hampshire Road in Thousand Oaks, the intersection of Tierra Rejada 
and Moorpark roads in Moorpark, High Street in Moorpark, California 118 in 
Saticoy, and the three-way intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Saviers 
and Wooley roads in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The completion last fall of a $39-million connector linking the Simi Valley 
and Moorpark freeways has relieved much of the congestion on High Street, and 
Caltrans is working to complete an overhaul of California 118 and construction 
of a new Saticoy Bridge by August. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are good projects that are going to be a big help in relieving 
congestion," Baxter said. "But some of these other projects are going to wait a 
long time for funding." 
</P>
<P>
 With funding a major source of delays, cities are looking for other ways to 
speed up road projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Transportation Manager Samia Maximous said it can take years to get a 
project through Caltrans bureaucracy, before ground is even broken for the 
planned work. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Baxter, little can be done to eliminate the delays, which are 
just a part of the way government works. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of precautions you have to take, a lot of guidelines to 
follow," he said. "It's just what you have to deal with when you deal with 
government. So what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Gilbert, Moorpark's public works director, gave a recent example of where 
Caltrans slowed a project. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark was planning to install new storm drains on Moorpark Avenue, also 
known as California 23. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Moorpark asked Caltrans to pick up part of the cost, the agency would 
not pay until it had determined how much of the runoff came from city 
development. After several months of delays and a hydrology study, Caltrans 
ended up paying 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have just estimated rather than going through the study," Gilbert 
said. "But that's not the way they do things. You've just got to be patient and 
push them to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is not the only culprit when projects get bogged down, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had tons of problems with joint projects with cities where we're ready 
to go, but the city can't come up with its share of the funding, so the project 
goes on the shelf," the Caltrans official said. "The pendulum swings both 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to improve communication with cities and help speed up projects, 
Caltrans several years ago opened a district office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said relations with the agency since then have improved 
somewhat, but problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely pleased with dealing with the satellite office," Ojai Public 
Works Director Stan Moore said. "But it's frustrating sometimes that Caltrans 
is so big that they don't bother to tell their own people what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, during Ojai's 95th annual tennis tournament, Moore received several 
calls from angry residents complaining about traffic backups on California 150, 
the main artery through town. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans had launched a paving project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the middle of this major event and, all of a sudden, Caltrans is 
out there doing crack filling," Moore said. "They didn't bother to tell anybody 
in the city, and it was a real hassle for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has since sent Moore a letter outlining its plans for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most amicable of relations between the cities, the county and 
Caltrans will not bring more money to Ventura County, and cities continue to 
fret over how they will fund roadway projects. 
</P>
<P>
 While cities and counties throughout California are facing the same federal 
funding shortages, Ventura County is the most populous county in the state 
without a portion of its local sales tax devoted to transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Ventura County voters overwhelmingly defeated a sales-tax measure. In 
November, the measure will appear on the ballot for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, much to the dismay of public works directors and traffic 
engineers seeking more funds for roads, the county's Transportation Commission 
has chosen to tackle the congestion problem from another angle: by beefing up 
public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, the commission has added Metrolink commuter rail 
service and, starting July 5, the commission and the cities will launch an 
unprecedented countywide bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, no matter how much we improve our roadways, we are not going to 
be able to avoid the problem of congestion," the commission's Stephens said. 
"The solution is to drive less, and that raises the need for alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: The struggle to get commuters out of their cars and onto Metrolink. 
Top 15 Transportation Projects

</P>
<P>
 This timeline gives a step-by-step look at one Caltrans project, from 
conception to near-completion: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1983: Caltrans reports that each day the rickety Saticoy Bridge handles more 
than 27,000 cars and trucks, the highest traffic volume on any two-lane state 
highway in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 A Caltrans environmental study finds the 34-year-old bridge "structurally 
deficient as well as functionally obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans proposes a project to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tear down the old two-lane Saticoy Bridge and replace it with a modern, 
four-lane span. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Widen 2.3 miles of highway on either side of the bridge from two to four 
lanes, from the interchange of California 118 and the Santa Paula Freeway to 
Vineyard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Build a new, direct link between the Wells Road section of California 118 
and the Los Angeles Avenue section of the route, eliminating a dogleg that 
causes traffic backups as drivers are forced to wind through the heart of 
Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected cost: $17 million. The estimated year state funding is expected to 
be available: 1987. Year the bridge is scheduled for completion: 1990.

<P>
 * 1984: Public hearing in Saticoy on the project draws more than 150 
residents, who raise concerns about noise, traffic and plans by Caltrans to 
condemn local businesses to make room for the new road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1985: A $300-million shortfall in the state's $5.3-billion highway project 
fund forces Caltrans to delay the project indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1989: Ventura County Transportation Commission reschedules project for 
construction beginning in 1992. Estimated cost increases to $21.85 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990: In January, Saticoy residents join forces to protest delays, saying 
the bridge is unsafe and needs immediate repairs. Blaming rising land prices, 
Caltrans in December increases estimated cost of Saticoy project to $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991: In response to the increased cost and delays in buying rights of way, 
Caltrans splits the project into two parts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phase One includes construction of the new bridge and road widening. 
Estimated cost: $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phase Two entails adding a new California 118 link. Caltrans condemns 7 
businesses to make room for the new stretch of roadway. Estimated cost of Phase 
Two: $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992: Nine years after the project was conceived, work begins on Phase One. 
At the urging of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Caltrans spends $12,000 on 
12-foot-high mesh screens to hang from the bottom of the old bridge deck to 
shield nesting swallows from construction work. Overall, bids come in lower 
than expected because of the recession. Cost of Phase One drops to $13.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: Ten years after the project was conceived, work begins on Phase Two. 
Recession lowers cost to $9 million.

OXNARD'S BUDGET PUTS SOME JOBS ON THE LINE; CUTBACKS: OFFICIALS SAY LAYOFFS ARE 
LIKELY IN COMING FISCAL YEAR'S SPENDING PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES A POTENTIAL 
$2-MILLION DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Last year around this time, the buzzword at Oxnard City Hall was streamline.  
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to cure a crippling budget shortfall, city leaders set out to shrink 
the number of city departments without sacrificing municipal services or 
workers. The new approach saved money and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the buzzword is re-engineer : a reference to a series of 
cost-saving staff proposals ranging from the city operating its own animal 
shelter to allowing patrons to check out their own books at the branch library. 
</P>
<P>
 But no new ideas, no matter how good, are likely to save city jobs this time, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a $2-million deficit, the Oxnard City Council on Tuesday will start the 
painful process of adopting its 1994-95 fiscal year budget, a spending plan 
that calls for up to 37 layoffs and the elimination of about 18 vacant 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks, if adopted, would be the most sweeping in city history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately for us, we have nowhere else to go," said Mayor Manuel Lopez, 
who has been through plenty of budget-cutting sessions but none with as much on 
the line as this one. "The only options we have are to raise taxes, cut 
services or cut employees. This time, I think some employees will have to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Budget analysts caution that the budget proposal represents a worst-case 
scenario, a desperate balancing act designed to counter the state's practice of 
withholding fees that used to trickle down to local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The more money the state withholds, officials say, the more workers will lose 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the mercy of the state government," Lopez said. "The big fish eats 
the little fish." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, state cuts have resulted in a loss of $13 million to Oxnard. 
As a result, nearly 200 positions have been sliced from a work force that stood 
at 1,100 four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That reduction has been achieved without layoffs, for the most part. Many 
employees who have left the city haven't been replaced. Some workers have been 
shuffled from one department to another to fill the most critical vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they will try to transfer to other departments those 
workers who hold jobs targeted for elimination. But they say that more than 
likely, some skilled and valuable employees will be out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any way to avoid it," Councilman Tom Holden said. "We 
just can't assume that things are going to get a lot better in the next five to 
10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 What Holden and others say they want to avoid is a reduction in the current 
level of city services. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, Ventura County's largest city has opted to cut services instead 
of people. Faced with tough choices during times of survival economics, city 
leaders looked on as park restrooms closed and the city's police force became 
one of the lowest staffed in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently have officials begun to reverse that trend. Last year, the City 
Council agreed to take $500,000 from reserves to hire eight more police 
officers. And Holden said he is working on a plan to reopen the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is our responsibility in city government? Is it our responsibility to 
provide jobs or to provide services?" Holden said. "When it comes down to the 
ultimate decision, our responsibility is to provide a city government that is 
effective and efficient, and provides a certain level of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, council members say they know that they will face plenty of opposition 
as they pore over the budget during Tuesday and Thursday study sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders have already expressed concern about the potential for layoffs. 
But at this time, council members say they have little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what has happened is that city government, and, rightfully so, has 
been treading very gingerly on these areas," Councilman Andres Herrera said. 
"Now as we embark on this new episode, there are unfortunately some harsh 
realities we have to contend with."

LEADERS PLAN CAMPAIGN TO SAVE 2 BASES; ECONOMY: GROUP WILL LOBBY MILITARY, 
LAWMAKERS ON THE CRITICAL ROLE THE NAVAL FACILITIES PLAY IN VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Determined not to lose the economic benefits of Ventura County's two Navy 
bases, local business leaders are organizing a campaign to keep the facilities 
open as they undergo next year's base realignment and closure review. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, known as the BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) '95 Task Force, 
hopes to bring the county's business and civic leaders together to forge a 
strategy to help save the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station and the Port 
Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center as they undergo the congressionally 
mandated closure and consolidation review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goals are simple. We want to educate the public and the (base closure) 
commission about the important role the bases play in our local economy," said 
Frank Moss, a task force organizer. "Secondly, we want to formulate lobbying 
strategies that will help preserve the facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the year that testing and evaluation facilities such as Point Mugu 
will be scrutinized under the base-closure process. Moss said he is confident 
that the task force will play an important role in keeping both bases open. 
</P>
<P>
 With a combined payroll of more than $550 million and more than 15,000 
military and civilian employees, the Point Mugu and Port Hueneme facilities 
represent a critical component of Ventura County's economy, Moss and Navy 
officials said. Navy officials say Point Mugu's operations alone contribute 
more than $310 million to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss is treasurer of the Ventura County Defense Services Industry Executives 
Assn., a group of defense contractors that provide millions of dollars in goods 
and services to the two bases each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are facing a no-holds-barred look this time. We will have the 
commission for the first time placing special interest on test and evaluation 
facilities," Moss said. "In this area, there is quite a bit of competition 
within the Navy and from other service branches." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Charney, president of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn., 
which is co-sponsoring the task force, said a major reduction or closure of 
either of the Navy bases would send shock waves through the community -- both 
economically and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 Closure "would be a real blow to this community," Charney said. "I think that 
a lot of people are not aware of how dependent this county is on the Navy. 
Anything we can do to prevent this kind of closure from happening has got our 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss said the task force's fall-back position is to sell to lawmakers the idea 
of creating a multi-service weapons testing and evaluation complex, combining 
the Point Mugu and China Lake Navy bases and Edwards and Vandenberg Air Force 
bases. Such consolidation would probably keep most of the jobs now at Point 
Mugu, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be run by the Department of Defense and would serve all service 
branches," Moss said. "If we can't keep the facility in the hands of the Navy, 
then this would be our next best option." 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the lobbying group comes as both Navy bases continue to provide 
officials of the base-closure commission with information on what is known as a 
"data call" -- a process whereby information on the bases is transmitted to 
officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The data call is the first step in the biannual base-closure process. During 
the 1993 round of closures, both Point Mugu and Port Hueneme emerged largely 
unscathed, losing a total of 15 jobs between them, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Miller, spokesman for Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), said the 
congressman supports creation of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "The congressman believes it's important to get the message out to the 
community about how vital our bases are in terms of employment and the dollars 
they place into the local economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss said the task force will hold its first meeting from 4 to 6 p.m. June 29 
at the offices of Veda Inc., 5141 Verdugo Way, Camarillo. The public is invited 
to participate. For information, call 388-8332.

STREET SMART: SIGNALS INSTALLED TOO CLOSE DO NOT SOLVE SAFETY PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The new road construction in the Saticoy area has created a traffic hazard I'm 
hoping can be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning from Violeta Street onto the new stretch of California 118 is very 
dangerous. There is a bend in the 118, right before Violeta, so visibility is 
not good. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the past two weeks, I've pulled out onto the 118 and almost been hit 
by traffic that I couldn't see coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be possible to install a signal at this intersection? 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Ybarra, Saticoy 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Adding a signal would not solve the safety problem, project manager Lou Quan 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of construction, the state Department of Transportation has already 
installed a signal at the intersection of Telephone Road and the 118, just 400 
feet to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not good engineering to install two signals so close together," Quan 
said. "But if residents still want a signal after all the construction work is 
completed, we could reconsider." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Quan suggests that you enter the 118 from the Telephone Road 
intersection. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Please help me clear up a question about a street name that has been causing 
some confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 I always thought that the street I live on was called North Dos Caminos Avenue 
. 
</P>
<P>
 The street signs back me up on this. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the U. S. Post Office ZIP code book, it's listed as North Dos Caminos 
Street . 
</P>
<P>
 Who is correct? 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Roth, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are. 
</P>
<P>
 City Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says the proper name of the road is North 
Dos Caminos Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to all the city maps, it's an avenue," Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 A post office spokesman said the error will be corrected. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As a business owner in Simi Valley, my company is concerned about a chronic 
parking problem on East Los Angeles Avenue between Tapo Street and Ralston 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, another local company has been using the curb in front of 
my business to park three moving vans. 
</P>
<P>
 These vans cause a safety problem by blocking visibility for cars and trucks 
leaving the driveway and heading onto busy Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I asked the company to move its vans, they said there is no other 
safe place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be possible to limit parking along this stretch of Los Angeles 
Avenue? 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Adler, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is solved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council at its meeting last week agreed that the vans 
were a safety hazard and voted to ban parking in front of your business. 
SPEEDERS BEWARE 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol has installed a radar trailer on Santa Rosa Road 
near Penelope Place west of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 As motorists drive by, a large digital board will flash their speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the trailer, according to Public Affairs Officer Staci Morse, 
is to "raise drivers' overall public awareness and warn them of their excessive 
and unsafe speeds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highway Patrol may choose to reinforce this message by having an officer 
on hand to issue speeding tickets, Morse says. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailer will remain for about a month.

FIORE IS THOUSAND OAKS' ARCHITECT OF CHANGE; POLITICS: COUNCILMAN WILL SOON END 
30 YEARS OF SERVICE. HE'S CLASHED WITH SOME ALONG THE WAY, BUT FEW DENY HIS 
INDELIBLE MARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Congressman? Piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Senator? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 President? Don't sweat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those jobs are nothing compared with a seat on a contentious city council. 
Dealing with clogged sewers and bumpy roads, irate neighbors and pushy 
developers has to be the hardest job in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Thousand Oaks Councilman Alex Fiore, who has nearly three decades of 
experience backing him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore will formally move into the mayor's seat Tuesday as he enters the last 
six months of his 30-year political career. Set to retire in November, he's 
ready now to muse on his long years of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 His first thought: The job's a lot nastier than it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a snap to be a United States senator because your constituents 
don't know what you're doing," Fiore said. "The city council level is the 
toughest form of government because you're eyeball to eyeball with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 On the city council, you have to reject your bridge partner's project to build 
a dozen townhomes on a sage-covered hill. You have to turn down an old buddy's 
scheme to build a huge shopping mall in the middle of Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
You have to cite your neighbor for hammering away at a deck without building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 And as you're voting against them, you have to look them in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of friendships, Fiore said, you have to do "the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly three decades, Alex Fiore has articulated his version of "the right 
thing" while leading Thousand Oaks from an cattle-and-sheep town of 15,000 to a 
stucco-and-red-tile city of 110,000. 
</P>
<P>
 From the early 1960s, when he pushed for Thousand Oaks to incorporate, to the 
early 1990s, when he shaped plans for a splashy cultural center, Fiore has 
relentlessly molded the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And voters have seemingly approved of his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 When he takes over the City Council's wooden gavel in a brief ceremony Tuesday 
evening, Fiore will begin his seventh term as mayor. Elected to the council 
eight times, Fiore was the top vote-getter in all but two campaigns. Even in 
crowded races, he often received more than 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he never sought a seat on the County Board of Supervisors, never aimed at 
a berth in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ability you have to get things done in the city is awesome," Fiore said. 
"The further up you go (in the political system), the more you are a lone voice 
in the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
 Even his most gung-ho foes -- and he has many -- applaud Fiore's dedication to 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has donated thousands and thousands of hours, and God knows how much abuse 
he's taken over the years -- including from me -- and for that, I respect him," 
said Ken Bauer, who organized an aggressive recall campaign to oust Fiore from 
office in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of Fiore's opponents, Bauer first turned against the veteran 
councilman during the blood-and-guts battle over the $64-million Civic Arts 
Plaza. In his zeal to build a cultural center, Bauer charged, Fiore ignored 
concerns about the Civic Arts Plaza's size, cost and location. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer and others gathered 10,640 signatures in their drive to boot Fiore from 
the council. But the county registrar disqualified several hundred names, 
leaving the group 162 signatures short of the number needed to place a recall 
question on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Irate recall proponents challenged the registrar's decision in court and 
dragged the issue out for months. Bauer still maintains that the group had 
enough valid signatures to prompt a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A recall now, of course, is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore, 68, plans to retire in the fall. And, already, the accolades are 
tumbling forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex Fiore is probably the most caring, most astute, most sensitive 
problem-solver who has ever occupied a council seat in Ventura County in the 30 
years that I've been around," Thousand Oaks attorney Chuck Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But friends and opponents alike have noted a change in Fiore's demeanor over 
the past few years. Always gruff and plain-spoken, he has become more cranky, 
snapping at speakers and shouting down his colleagues on the dais. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex has lost some patience," said Cohen, a former council member. "He was 
not cantankerous or difficult prior to three or four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Unabashed, Fiore has cocked his hand like a gun and pretended to shoot himself 
in the temples to signal disgust. He has rolled his eyes and laughed out loud 
to show disagreement with speakers. During long meetings, he has clipped his 
fingernails, audibly, into the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes he goes beyond body language to lash out verbally. 
</P>
<P>
 During one recent exchange, Fiore tore apart the arguments of a speaker 
criticizing the city's policy for appraising land. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fiore's tone grew ever harsher, colleague Jaime Zukowski chided him: "I 
don't think it's right to debate the speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore's swift dismissal: "I don't care what you think, Jaime." 
</P>
<P>
 From the audience, Mary Harris shouted: "That was uncalled for, Alex!" 
Growling at her from his high-backed chair, Fiore responded simply, "Shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore readily admits that frustration has shortened his fuse. 
</P>
<P>
 He's still in the majority on the City Council. But he has never seen such a 
bitterly divided set of politicians joining him on the dais, has never 
experienced such brutal personal attacks during public meetings. And he's never 
seen so many gadflies take up so much time at the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just drives you up a wall," he said wearily. 
</P>
<P>
 His method of dealing with the frustration, he conceded, "might be considered 
abrasive." But he doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I think your idea is idiotic, I'm going to say it's idiotic," Fiore said. 
"I'm not going to play around like a politician and say, 'What a creative 
idea.' If you don't like it, tough. That's my style." 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of Fiore's temper is his wit, which flashes irrepressibly. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone told the council, after summer vacation, "We missed you," Fiore 
responded, "What were you throwing?" 
</P>
<P>
 And when a hoarse speaker took a drink from the council's Thermos, Fiore 
grinned and said, "Tell us if that's too strong for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Former colleague Bob Lewis, who served one term on the council in the 1980s, 
described Fiore as a "very keen wit" who "has always been a delight" even 
though they often clashed on development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, like other past and present colleagues, praised Fiore, especially for 
his fiscal leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired vice president and controller at Rockwell International's Rocketdyne 
division, Fiore has served on the city's Finance Committee for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunning calculators, he routinely scribbles figures on a legal pad during 
council meetings, as he double-checks a staff report or pencils out a cost 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 His antagonists accuse Fiore of slick tricks -- like juggling funds from one 
account to another to pay the Civic Arts Plaza's construction bills. He also 
made enemies with his suggestion that the city dip into a golf course fund to 
purchase part of Broome Ranch -- and then replenish the fund by building a 
championship course on the wilderness tract. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the criticism, Fiore remains supremely confident that his votes 
reflect the views of most people in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone among the current council, Fiore can vote against a pack of residents 
without spinning a long justification. The dozens of people who come down to 
protest certain projects seem, to him, "phony, pre-planned and pre-programmed." 
</P>
<P>
 So he often brushes aside their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to do what's in my heart, what I know the people of this city want," he 
said. "It doesn't matter if 90 people come down and say they don't want a 
project. It doesn't matter if they call me names or write nasty letters. I know 
I'm representing the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The 90 people who come down to protest development, of course, might take a 
different view. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiore offers an irrefutable response: "I've been elected eight times. I've 
got to think that means people generally like what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 If voters tune into city politics, they at least know what he does. For Fiore 
articulates his views succinctly and clearly, with little of the mumbo-jumbo 
jargon that muddies most council rhetoric. And his political beliefs are 
straightforward, although he admits to registering as a Democrat in the early 
1970s. Fiore now calls himself a Rush Limbaugh fan and has switched over to the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes, first and foremost, in free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that business owners have a right to run their businesses as they 
see fit. He believes that property owners have a right to develop their 
property. He believes that competitors should duke it out on their own, without 
government meddling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get tired of businesses being over-regulated, and I get tired of 
overzealous environmentalists," Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anyone who doesn't like trees, water and clean air, so, to some 
degree, we're all environmentalists. But some people just go crazy. They say, 
'Let's save this little chocolate lily,' even though if you do that, you can't 
give people a place to live. To me, that doesn't balance out." 
</P>
<P>
 As Thousand Oaks grew, Fiore helped draft the rigid planning standards that 
kept the community orderly. He still favors strict controls to protect 
ridgelines and preserve the tidy aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that just a few vacant lots remain to be developed in the Conejo 
Valley, Fiore has proved more willing to make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a bigger sign for Mervyn's or a few more apartments in an 
affordable-housing project, Fiore has signaled his desire to relax some of the 
city's notoriously stringent codes. 
</P>
<P>
 And that trend alarms his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, Alex deserves credit for the careful initial planning of this 
city," Newbury Park activist Michelle Koetke said. "But that good work could be 
undone with all the high-density, huge development he's been cramming down our 
throats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems kind of tragic," she added. "It's certainly going to be tragic for 
the valley unless we stop him." 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Mayor Elois Zeanah agreed, arguing that Fiore has begun to violate 
the principles that guided him -- and Thousand Oaks -- for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "New leadership is needed now to sustain the quality of life he helped 
establish in this community," Zeanah said. "We don't need a new vision; we just 
need to implement (the old one), and that means getting tough." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Fiore insists that he still cares about the city every bit as 
much as he used to, and maintains that his votes reflect the views of many 
people. But he agrees that, after 30 years, it's time for him to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he retires, however, he'll serve six months as mayor, presiding over 
the grand opening of the Civic Arts Plaza this fall. And even after he steps 
down, Fiore hopes to remain active in countywide commissions dealing with trash 
and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his formal titles, Zeanah said recently: "To many, Alex Fiore will 
always be the mayor of Thousand Oaks." Profile: Alex Fiore

DEVELOPER'S PLAN SPURS DEBATE IN MOORPARK; GROWTH: PROPOSAL TO CONSTRUCT 3,221 
HOMES WORRIES SOME WHO MOVED TO THE AREA TO ESCAPE URBAN SPRAWL. BUILDER CALLS 
THEIR FEARS UNFOUNDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing together on the northeast edge of Moorpark a few months ago, looking 
out over the rolling hills, City Councilman Pat Hunter and developer Gary 
Austin saw two very different pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hunter recalls thinking how the wide open land reminded him of why he 
moved his family to the city five years ago, Austin remembers looking at those 
hills and seeing future home sites for many more families. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were standing on the Hidden Creek Ranch property, discussing a project 
by Austin's company, Messenger Investment of Irvine, to build 3,221 homes on 
about 4,500 acres of grassland and chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of detailed planning -- trying to meet all the city's demands 
for open space, roads, a fire station and schools for what could amount to more 
than 10,000 additional people for this town of about 27,000 -- Austin thinks 
that the project is nearly ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in town, however, including several City Council members such as 
Hunter, are not sure that the development fits into Moorpark's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Standing up there, you can see how beautiful all those rolling hills are," 
Hunter said recently. "I told (Austin) I really was impressed by the project, 
but you know I'm originally from the San Fernando Valley and I loved it there, 
too. It got to a point, though, where I didn't want to live there anymore 
because of all the development. I didn't like it anymore. I don't want that to 
happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the Messenger development is central to the debate over growth 
in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hunter, many people who moved to Moorpark did so to escape the urban 
sprawl of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. They have repeatedly made 
growth a political hot button during City Council elections, demanding that 
their local politicians not allow development to destroy the town. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Moorpark was one of the fastest-growing cities in California, 
more than tripling in population from 7,800 residents in 1980 to about 25,000 
in 1990. The experience led to adoption of a growth-control ordinance in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that growth has slowed considerably since 1990, a committee 
has completed the draft of a new, stricter growth-control ordinance, which 
could take effect when the present ordinance expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will continue to take public comments on the proposal through 
the summer and is likely to vote on the measure in the fall, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin argues that the proposed ordinance, which would limit the number of 
homes he could build each year, would make his project economically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why this is still such a hot issue here," he said. "People 
are living in the past, making judgments by what happened six years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 He runs down the list of concerns expressed by growth-control advocates about 
his project, addressing each in quick fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of the area would be protected, he says. The Messenger Co. plans to 
leave nearly 70% of the property as open space by grouping homes in small, 
village-like clusters separated by bands of untouched land. 
</P>
<P>
 As for concerns that the influx of people from his project would overburden 
schools and roadways, Austin says his company will spend more than $150 million 
to build several new schools, roads and other infrastructure improvements 
before any homes are built. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a well-planned community with everything in right measure blending 
into the landscape with a generous amount of open space," Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern that impending growth from his project would destroy Moorpark's 
small-town character is unfounded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard economic times have made the rapid growth of the 1980s a thing of the 
past, he said, pointing out that the growth rate, which had once soared more 
than 200% during that decade, has slowed to less than 2% since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many argue that the pressure to develop Moorpark's rolling hillsides 
will come again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Siracusa, a real estate market researcher in Westlake Village, said 
Moorpark continues to be attractive for families moving out of the Valley. 
While the demand for housing that peaked in the 1980s -- when prospective home 
buyers actually lined up to buy homes -- will probably not be repeated, he 
said, people will continue to move to the area. In reports that he gives to 
developers, Siracusa has projected a steady rate of growth in Moorpark during 
the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still presents one of the best values for families interested in living in 
a rural country setting within commuting distance to Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers know Moorpark's appeal and, while the Messenger project is by far 
the largest development being considered by the city, it is not the only one. 
There are at least seven other developments, ranging in size from about 100 to 
700 homes, that the city expects could be built in the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While city planners estimate that altogether these projects would swell 
Moorpark's population to roughly 47,000 people by 2010, other estimates put 
that figure as high as 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who got out of the Valley are wondering if they just didn't 
move far enough away," said Clint Harper, a Moorpark College professor and 
former city councilman who moved from the San Fernando Valley in 1978. "It 
seems the nature of the beast that all communities sprawl, and it takes a lot 
of political willpower to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said Austin has represented his company well, driving up from Irvine 
and attending almost every City Council meeting for the last four years, but he 
argued that the city did not owe Messenger anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no obligation to make a land speculator rich," Harper said. "When a 
developer buys a piece of land, they're rolling the dice." 
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Brown, another former council member, said the attitude of Harper and 
other growth-control advocates is "unchristian." 
</P>
<P>
 "It begs the question, when do you shut the door?" she said. "Is it OK for Mr. 
Harper's family but not someone else's? It just doesn't fly. What I would like 
to see is directed growth. If people want to keep land from development, they 
should be willing to pay for it. They don't have a right to tell a property 
owner what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, after voters approved Moorpark's slow-growth ordinance, attorneys 
representing one of the local developers and the building industry challenged 
the law. They argued that the city had to show that the ordinance was needed to 
stop growth from overburdening such things as schools, water supplies and local 
roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was settled out of court. The limit on the number of homes that could 
be built each year was amended from 250 to 270, and one development of 2,500 
homes was exempted from the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft for a new growth ordinance returns to the 250 figure, and the city 
has been warned by building industry representatives that it could face another 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because voters decide to use the ballot box to attempt to make 
growth-management and growth-control decisions does not mean that the ordinance 
will stand up to a legal challenge," Austin said in a recent letter to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Thompson and Bob Crockford, who have been involved in drafting the new 
ordinance, said they were worried about possible legal challenges. Thompson 
said it's unclear how the courts would rule on a new ordinance, but she left no 
question about how she felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that a community isn't a community unless the people who 
live there have control over their own destiny," she said. "They should be able 
to state what their wishes are, and we don't want Moorpark to become like every 
other overdeveloped and overpopulated city in Southern California. We want to 
control our own fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Covered with dust from a morning spent working on his five-acre avocado 
orchard only a mile away from City Hall, Crockford echoed Thompson's points. 
"The beauty of this place is that it isn't like everywhere else," he said. "It 
isn't wall-to-wall housing, but mixed with homes next to small farms or horse 
corrals. It isn't strip malls and suburban sprawl, and we're trying to keep it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking out from his home next to the Messenger property, Mike Leckrone can 
see green meadows and large oaks through to the horizon. He said his family 
regularly sees owls and red tail hawks, and they often hear coyotes at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful place and we want to keep it that way," he said. "But that 
doesn't mean there can be no development. The bottom line shouldn't be some 
arbitrary number of houses each year, but assurances that any development 
protects the beauty of the town." 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental review of the possible impact of the Messenger development is 
under way and will take several months to complete. The City Council plans to 
open public discussion on the growth control ordinance in July and possibly 
enact the ordinance in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter and his fellow council members have all said they support renewing the 
growth-control ordinance. Whether the new ordinance will make the Messenger 
project economically infeasible is still an open question, but Hunter said he 
hopes that something can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still early on in the process and a lot could happen to make the 
development possible," he said. "But ultimately Messenger is going to have to 
abide by any mandates placed on them by the city. Any development will have to 
be on our terms."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD, SANTA PAULA; 4 MINORITY YOUTHS WIN 
SCHOLARSHIPS

 A Channel Islands High School student who received a $3,500 scholarship from 
the Ventura County Minority Business Group will use the money to help pay for 
her first year at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, senior Susana Pitones said, the investment made by the group 
will come back to the county when she returns with her college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to come back to the county and work here," Pitones said. "I see 
a lot of need for Latinos to come back to Oxnard. I want to be a role model and 
show others that it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitones was one of four county high school students who each received $3,500 
scholarships from the group. Ventura County National Bank contributed $4,000 to 
the fund, and individual members of the group donated a total of more than 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship fund is in its second year. Winners are selected based on 
academic excellence, community involvement and financial need. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners of $3,500 scholarships were Shelly Soto, a senior at Santa Paula 
Union High School; Juan Lechuga, a senior at Oxnard's Rio Mesa High School, and 
Christina Mata, also a senior at Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 19 finalists each received $100 savings bonds from the bank. MARY

 Katrina Nguyen has been named student representative to the Garden Grove 
Unified School District Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, a junior at Bolsa Grande High School, will serve as a non-voting 
member with the board's five elected trustees for the 1994-95 school year, 
district spokesman Alan Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other responsibilities will be to preside over monthly meetings of a 
student advisory committee to the board and serve as a liaison for the 
district's 41,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 17, said that she looks forward to representing the district and that 
the position is important in providing administrators and elected school 
officials a student's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members, who set policy, "don't go to school and don't always know what 
the students are facing. That's why it's so important to have a student on the 
board, to share with the older generation what it's like nowadays in school," 
she said. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FILIPINOS SAMPLE TASTE OF NOSTALGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many Filipino Americans, the two-day "Fiesta Filipiniana" celebration at 
Knott's Berry Farm over the weekend was a welcome break from the frenetic pace 
of life.  
</P>
<P>
 They sampled bibingka and puto (both rice cakes) to freshen palates that 
during the rest of the year are dulled by too many hamburgers and hot dogs. 
They listened to the kundiman, the melodic Filipino love songs that never could 
be confused with rap. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening Saturday and Sunday, a santacruzan, the religious procession 
that caps May festivities in most Philippine towns, took older festival-goers 
on a nostalgic trip back to their youth in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes me want to go back home," said Paz Mandap, 64, of Anaheim, after 
watching the procession of sagalas, or princesses, representing Filipino 
American organizations. "It brings back a lot of memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandap's sentiments were echoed by many of the 20,000 Filipino Americans who 
attended the weekend festivities, held as part of the celebration of the 
Philippines Independence Day on June 12. It is the first time the event has 
been celebrated on such a wide scale in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This festival, hopefully, will help erase our label as an invisible 
minority," said Filusa Timbancaya, one of the event organizers, who said that 
state and local politicians have ignored Filipino Americans, although about 
half a million of them live in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some found political meaning in the celebration, others said they 
were happy simply to be part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like coming home," said Joel Dauz of Fontana. "Everywhere you look, you 
see a Filipino." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those he met was May Bautista, a classmate at the University of Santo 
Tomas in Manila whom he had not seen in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Over pancit malabon (noodles) and chicharon bulaklak (fried pig intestines), 
the two friends reminisced about their student days as they dined at one of the 
food booths on festival grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all worth it," said Dauz, a sentiment that Bautista, a Glendale 
resident, readily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Chejini, a native of Iran who married a Filipina after completing his 
studies in the Philippines in the 1970s, said he has been waiting for Filipinos 
to hold a major celebration since moving here nine years ago. Now a Fountain 
Valley resident, Chejini said he hopes Filipino Americans will be more active 
as a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individually, they are successful," Chejini said. "But as an ethnic group, 
they need to be more united and visible." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was one of the biggest cultural presentations at Knott's Berry Farm, 
and theme park officials said that the event was successful for the park and 
the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the type of event that brings families, generations and cultures 
together," said Knott's Berry Farm spokesman Bob Ochsner. "The celebration 
appeals to both Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was held in four different sections of the park, and people paid 
the usual park entry fee of $19 and another $7 to attend the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Several festival-goers said the event could have been better organized if 
venues were not spread throughout the park and events did not overlap in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said that there were some glitches, but promised better 
organization next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuh Ledesma, a popular Manila singer now based in Los Angeles, told an 
audience at her concerts on Saturday and Sunday never to forget their native 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep that in your hearts, and tell your American friends how beautiful is our 
country and the smiles of our people," she said.BERT ELJERA

THEY GOT THEIR KICKS IN GLENDALE 
</P>

<P>
 Glendale residents leaned out second-story windows to urge on participants in 
an 18-mile soccer relay held this weekend as the kickoff event for a series of 
parties designed to entice World Cup enthusiasts to visit the city. 
</P>
<P>
 About 225 residents kicked a soccer ball for one-tenth of a mile each during 
Saturday's festivities, which wound around an oblong relay course beginning at 
Kenneth Road and Ruberta Avenue, traveling down Glendale Avenue to the city's 
business district, up Verdugo Road into Montrose and La Crescenta and ending in 
Verdugo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-year-olds joined 70-year-olds in the city-organized event, which took 
about seven hours to complete. Several local businesses contributed money and 
other resources to support the kick-off and two street parties scheduled to 
coincide with World Cup activities. 
</P>
<P>
 A Summer Kick-Off Festival -- replete with music, food and booths featuring 
information on local businesses and nonprofit agencies -- welcomed kickers to 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Relay participants were escorted by a motorcade of police motorcycles, high 
school soccer teams and city dignitaries, several of whom were injured when 
they attempted to maneuver the unpredictable ball through city byways. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens, who started the event and later joined the rest of the 
City Council for a turn at kicking the ball along Brand Boulevard, played down 
a hand injury, caused when she tripped, saying she hurt the same wrist in an 
accident several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of time city staff members spent planning the well-attended event 
is more important than council members' bumps and bruises, Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our worst problem during the kick-off was that council members kept falling 
down," she joked. "The event was very successful in promoting the city and 
building community spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 A fall suffered by Councilman Sheldon Baker was captured by television 
cameras, and Councilwoman Mary Ann Plumley was nursing a black eye Sunday 
morning. Officials also hope to lure World Cup visitors with a country-Western 
street party on June 24 and a cruise night scheduled for July 15. JENNIFER

 Susan Cooper of Ventura surveyed the hundreds of hand-carved dolphins, boots

 More than 25 woodcarvers assembled Sunday at the church exhibit hall to show 
off their talent and share woodcarving tactics and style. Although a sign 
outside informed visitors that some of the artwork might be available for 
purchase, the show was primarily designed to display the artists' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just being able to create something of your own that's unique," said 
Richard Cronin of Thousand Oaks, president of Channel Islands Carvers, a 
woodcarving club of about 75 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of the creativeness I have as a designer," said Cronin, a 
retired aerospace engineer and designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cronin uses straight chisels, gouges and simple pocketknives to create a 
variety of art forms. One of Cronin's prize works is a four-foot-long wooden 
dragon crafted with 77 pieces of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't sell any of mine," he said. "I'm going to give them all to my kids as 
heirlooms." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Craig of Ventura teaches woodcarving to troubled young people as a way 
for them to express their individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works as a form of therapy for many of my students," said Craig, who also 
draws and sketches. "It's a way for them to express themselves and they can 
escape in their own art forms." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired contractor Elmo Shearer helped establish Channel Islands Carvers 19 
years ago. Now he teaches woodcarving at the club's meetings as a way to reduce 
stress and accomplish goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to relax, and it doesn't cost too much," said Shearer, who 
fancies creating six-inch fishermen, small mice and Santa Claus sculptures. 
"You can use your pocketknife when you first start, then graduate to gouges." 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer said he loses track of time when he works on woodcarvings at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just something about it that when you start, you can't give it up," 
he said. "I'm bored to death if I don't have a knife in my hand." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; WOMAN KILLED WHEN CAR PLUNGES INTO SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 80-year-old woman died Sunday after she lost control of her car while 
driving on Pacific Coast Highway near Point Mugu and plunged off a 50-foot 
embankment and into the ocean, where the car landed upside down and quickly 
sank, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Van de Water of Long Beach was driving north at about 60 m.p.h. on a 
stretch of windy coastal highway about half a mile south of Deer Creek Road 
when she lost control of her car, crossed over the southbound lane and left the 
road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was pending to determine the cause of death, a deputy coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
 No other motorists were involved in the 11:45 a.m. accident, said Simon 
Cavazos, a ranger with the California Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witnesses said that she spun out of control and went over the embankment," 
Cavazos said. "Once the car hit the water, it sank almost immediately. The car 
was pretty badly mangled." 
</P>
<P>
 State parks divers tried to rescue the woman but could not free her from the 
wreckage, Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her death is one of a handful of fatal accidents to occur along that stretch 
of road this year. Since 1989, more than 20 people have died in accidents on 
Pacific Coast Highway between the Ventura/Los Angeles County line and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a consortium of federal, state and county agencies began a driver 
safety campaign in March. Known as COAST -- Concentrate on a Safe Trip -- the 
$280,000 campaign is using billboard, radio, television and print 
advertisements to get drivers to be more careful while traveling the scenic, 
ocean-side route. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLANT REPLACEMENT FOR ESTUARY HABITAT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city plan to replace non-native plants with native vegetation at the Ventura 
River estuary does not require an extensive environmental review, Ventura city 
staff said in a report to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the report Monday, the city could begin digging up 
invasive plants such as the giant Kikuyu grass and castor bean as early as 
August, replacing them with shrubs native to the riverbanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants need to be replaced because the animals living along the river feed 
on the native plants and will have little left to eat if that greenery is 
choked out by exotic flora. 
</P>
<P>
 The project to upgrade the estuary is being run by the city of Ventura, the 
California Department of Parks and Recreation, and the California Coastal 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacement of vegetation is the first phase of a three-part project to 
restore the area. In the second phase, the agencies would remove undomesticated 
cats and other large animals, in addition to building a wooden trail to protect 
sand dunes. A visitors' center and amphitheater are also planned for this 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The third phase would concentrate on restoring the second mouth of the river, 
and trails would be linked between the estuary and the second mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for the first phase, as outlined by the city staff report, calls for 
workers to begin removing the non-native plants around Aug. 1 to avoid 
disturbing any breeding birds in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Native vegetation will be planted no later than Jan. 1, again to avoid 
disturbing the birds that nest at the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 An archeologist and a local Native American knowledgeable about prehistoric 
and historic artifacts will be brought in to help supervise the digging, in 
case anything of historical value is discovered. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI VALLEY; COMMERCE OFFICIAL TO DISCUSS RADAR 
TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Secretary of Commerce David Barram will meet with Ojai Valley residents 
next week to discuss the radar tower on Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with U. S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D -- Calif.) on May 26, commerce 
officials agreed to travel to California to discuss the issue with Ojai Valley 
residents firsthand, officials with the senator's office said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not made a commitment to do anything about the tower at this point, 
but we believe it's important that he hear their concerns," said Sam Chapman, 
Boxer's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents fear that the National Weather Service's radar, which is 
designed to monitor approaching storms, could pose health risks, and many are 
angered that the federal government installed the tower without notifying 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge, however, ruled earlier this year that sufficient health 
studies were conducted and that the government did not act capriciously when it 
erected the tower in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the radar tower, which has been operating for a few months, have 
appealed to various elected officials to help get it moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer, who met with Ojai residents at the tower site in late April, has said 
she is committed to having the weather tracking system relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the schedule for Barram's visit has not been completed, Chapman said 
Barram will probably meet with city and county officials before the community 
meeting. A site for the June 20 meeting has yet to be determined. TRACY WILSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; PUBLIC HEARINGS TO BE HELD ON CITY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members will hold public hearings today and Tuesday on the 
proposed $81.2-million 1994-95 city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are invited to attend the hearings, which will take place at City 
Hall at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. on both days. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget calls for continued downsizing of city staff and 
operations, with about 20 positions proposed for elimination, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, however, was prepared prior to the recall last week of a majority 
of the City Council, which had increased taxes last year. It is anticipated 
that further cuts will be needed to balance the budget once they are out of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead 
were recalled over their support of a 2% utility tax, which brings in about $3 
million in revenue annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall proponents said they are working on getting people who are committed to 
repealing the tax elected to take over the three officials' posts. Should the 
tax be eliminated, it is unknown how the city would cover the shortfall. But 
officials said more job and program cuts would be likely. 
</P>
<P>
 During today's budget hearings, money spent by the offices of the council, the 
city manager, the city clerk, the city attorney, finance, personnel, library, 
airport and community services, as well as fire and police departments will be 
scrutinized. On Tuesday, the council will review the development services, 
engineering, redevelopment and maintenance services departments and capital 
improvements program's budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the budget are available for review in the city clerk's office and 
the finance department office, both at City Hall, and in the Fullerton Public 
Library and Hunt Branch Library. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; WORK TO BEGIN ON IMPERIAL HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-month, $1.1-million project to widen Imperial Highway adjacent to the 
Civic Center and Brea Mall is scheduled to get underway today. 
</P>
<P>
 The work will involve adding right-turn lanes between the Orange Freeway and 
Randolph Avenue.Imperial will remain open throughout the project, and at most 
times three lanes of traffic will be maintained in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will generally occur from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. weekdays. Work will 
be halted during the holiday shopping period from Nov. 11 through Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's first phase, scheduled to continue through August, will involve 
work along the north side of Imperial. Tasks will include removing center 
island medians, replacing sewer lines, installing new traffic signals at 
Randolph and State College, building retaining walls with ornamental fencing, 
and putting in new street lighting, curbs, gutters and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase Two, planned for September through early November, will focus on the 
south side of Imperial. The final phase, scheduled for January through March of 
1995, will involve installation of landscaped center island medians, and 
repaving Randolph south of Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
 For updates on the widening project, call the city's Imperial Highway hot line 
at (714) 671-4410.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; STUDENTS EXCITED BY WONDERS OF SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jessie, the black Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, came to school wearing a 
gold-stud earring, her toenails painted hot pink. Squeals and all, she was a 
hit among students at Urbain H. Plavan Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Elastic the tree frog, Iggy the iguana, Gus the chinchilla, Penny the 
hen, Taco Belle the parakeet and three rats named Raja, Jasmine and Curly Sue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pets came to school Friday as part of Science Discovery Day. 
</P>
<P>
 During the event, students learned about the wonders of science, the animal 
kingdom and how to care properly for reptiles, mammals and amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding the bright green frog in the palm of his hand, fourth-grader Daniel 
Garcia told his classmates that Elastic needs water to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, 10, also said that his frog makes a good pet because he doesn't smell, 
is clean and will live for a long time. Daniel said he wanted to show off 
Elastic and tell other students how to take care of the pet "so if they decide 
to get a frog, it won't die." 
</P>
<P>
 Students were also introduced to a hissing cockroach -- the male hisses to 
scare predators and attract mates -- and learned that insects have six jointed 
legs and use antennae to feel and smell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get them interested and comfortable with science and get them 
curious about the world of science around them," said teacher Pennie Sleeper, 
who organized the event. "Some people think science is something they can't do, 
but it is something that can be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Other lessons in science included making bouncing "super balls" out of a 
chemical concoction, creating electricity and discovering microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Peering into a microscope, fourth-grader Shaun Campbell, 10, examined strands 
of a classmate's blond hair. "It's weird," he said, taking another look. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie McGee, a microbiologist at Orange County Sanitation Districts in 
Fountain Valley, presented the "Teeny Tiny World" of microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed students what spit, flower parts, water, blood and a spider look 
like when enlarged by a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus was looking at microorganisms and seeing that there is a whole 
world they can't see with the naked eye," McGee said. DEBRA CANO

 Parents who find putting on a child's birthday party too much trouble don't 
have to make their child go without birthday fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Parks and Recreation Department throws two-hour children's birthday 
parties at Crown Valley Community Park, 29751 Crown Valley Parkway.For $175, 
recreation staff will set up birthday decorations, buy a birthday cake and 
punch, and present crafts and games for a child's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the parent has to do is show up and relax," said Laguna Niguel recreation 
supervisor Sylvia Friedrichsen, who introduced the birthday parties a year and 
a half ago. "It makes it an enjoyable time for parents. Usually, it's a big 
hassle."

<P>
 Friedrichsen said a variety of game packages are available for children ages 
3-12. Games range from "pin the heart on the teddy bear" to tug-of-war. One 
recreation staff member is on hand for every 10 children.

<P>
 The center will provide frail and ill seniors with medically supervised care

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; HISTORIC HOUSES MOVE TO THEIR NEW HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of Buena Park's oldest homes became the newest buildings in the city's 
historic district last week when they were moved about half a mile down Beach 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a thrill," said Nickie Jeannerette, a docent with the Buena Park 
Historical Society. "The Bacon House was the cutest thing. It just went down 
the road like it was on roller skates." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannerette joined other members of the society, City Council members and 
assorted residents Friday morning to watch a crew move the Whitaker-Jaynes 
house, built in 1887, and an even older squatter's shack called the Bacon House 
to their new sites across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other buildings in the district are the First Congregational Church and the 
former Stage Stop Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council gave final approval to a master plan for the historic site 
during a June 6 meeting. The homes will sit on four-foot blocks until a 
foundation can be poured, said Thomas Lynch, director of development services. 
The city hopes to have the houses on their foundations and the extensive 
landscaping finished by late October, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council began plans for the move last year when it needed the room to 
expand its auto center. The city owns both homes and the historic site. Cost 
for the project is $568,000, said Wes Morgan, director of recreation, parks and 
community services. All of the money came from the Community Redevelopment 
Agency's funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story Whitaker-Jaynes house was built by Andrew Whitaker, the brother 
of James Whitaker, who founded Buena Park. Less is known about the Bacon House, 
which was built as a squatter's shack sometime in the 1850s, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses, which were put on blocks a week ago, were moved onto three dollies 
with pneumatic tires about 11 p.m. Thursday, said Donald Kelley, foreman with 
Snow House Movers Inc. of Garden Grove. They were attached to hauling trucks 
and started rolling down Beach about 2 a.m., arriving at the site about an hour 
later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kelley said the operation proceeded smoothly and according to plans, 
some of the observers were worried when the houses cleared wires and trees by 
just inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some harrowing moments," Jeannerette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch added that the movers had to do some maneuvering but that everything 
went as planned. "It was exciting to watch such skilled craftsmen move a house 
without any problems at all," he said.LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 The class will be held at the new Irvine Senior Center and will be taught by

minutes later, the father found the child and the search for her was called 
off, Thies said.

<P>
 Officials searching for witnesses to a stabbing that occurred in Thousand Oaks 
last week are offering $1,000 for information that leads to an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 A 21-year-old man was in the parking lot of a Thousand Oaks convenience store 
on Thousand Oaks Boulevard on June 3 when he was approached by a man who 
accused him of entering gang territory, according to a statement from Ventura 
County Crime Stoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man then approached the 21-year-old, stabbed him, pushed him down and 
kicked him in the head several times, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects retreated to a black Honda Accord that was driven by a woman, 
the statement said. The victim received several stitches and was released from 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Ventura County 
Crime Stoppers at 494-TALK.

THOUSAND OAKS GETS FUNDS FOR CLEAN-FUEL VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks will receive up to $37,000 from Ventura County to help fund the 
city's purchase of eight vehicles that will run on compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors approved the funding last week on a recommendation 
from the Clean Air Fund Advisory Committee, a panel set up to make spending 
proposals for a 1991 grant of $1.5 million from the 3M Co.The supervisors 
agreed to match donations made to Thousand Oaks by The Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go toward the purchase of four pickup trucks and four transit 
buses, all of which will be powered by compressed natural gas, a 
cleaner-burning fuel than gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks transit officials, in the midst of converting all of the city's 
trucks and buses to compressed natural gas, welcomed the donation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is the same as most other transit systems: to provide transportation 
for the citizens by producing the least amount of pollution," said Roy Myers, 
the city's transportation engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is to convert the whole fleet of trucks we have at the municipal 
center." 
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies looking at buying compressed natural gas-powered vehicles 
include the cities of Long Beach and Sacramento, as well as the South Coast 
Area Transit system, which provides public transportation in the Oxnard area. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks has already set up a portable "slow-fueling" station to pump the 
natural gas into its trucks and buses. But Myers said the city is working with 
The Gas Co. to construct a permanent "fast-fuel" facility. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE: CLOUDS, FOG, DRIZZLE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County motorists can expect to use their headlights and flick on their 
windshield wipers again this morning as weather forecasters called for more low 
clouds, fog and even a little drizzle for certain areas in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a broken record for a while," said Clay Morgan, a 
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard."It's pretty typical 
for this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan said the trace of drizzle recorded at Point Mugu and Ventura on 
Sunday morning caught even forecasters by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The misty morning weather gave way to scattered sunshine by late afternoon, 
prompting a light crowd of intrepid beach-goers to hit the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey Culp, a lifeguard at San Buenaventura State Beach, said a few hundred 
beach-goers braved the cool temperatures but that most chose to stay out of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty slow out here," Culp said. "We were scheduled for a big day, 
but the weather didn't materialize and the crowd didn't show." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said the pattern of low clouds and fog should remain in the county for 
the next few days, with daytime highs reaching the low 70s and overnight lows 
hovering in the mid- to high 50s. J. E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 125 APPLY FOR CITY QUAKE-RELIEF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 125 Thousand Oaks residents have applied for earthquake-relief 
funds, but city officials said they should have enough money to cover all 
legitimate requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents must submit applications by Thursday to get a chunk of the city's 
quake-recovery pot, which includes $501,000 in federal funds plus local 
redevelopment money.Before receiving city funds, applicants must prove that 
they have exhausted all other sources, including state and federal loans and 
private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 City grants of up to $30,000 per household can be used to pay for 
quake-related repairs, such as patching cracked plaster, replacing fallen roof 
tiles or rebuilding masonry walls. The money cannot, however, cover the cost of 
replacing broken household goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people call up thinking they're going to get their crystal and china 
replaced. But our program is for the necessities, whatever's necessary to make 
the home livable," said Dan Severn, a city official taking applications. 
</P>
<P>
 While Severn could not estimate the total of funding requested, he said he 
believes that the city's coffers will cover all needs. Mayor Elois Zeanah, who 
has spoken with victims, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Any money left over would be used to survey city dams for earthquake damage, 
buy emergency supplies and train the Disaster Assistance Response Team, 
officials said. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Fred Newhart Elementary School was singled out recently as one of 30 
California finalists for the 1993-94 National Blue Ribbons School Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a testament to the kind of quality education that goes on every day 
at Newhart School," said Capistrano Unified School District spokesperson Jackie 
Price."It's also a tribute to the students, their family and the community that 
supports the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, 529 public and private schools were nominated for the honors. 
Schools were chosen for their student achievements, academic record, parent and 
community support and curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school was visited by a federal review team member to substantiate 
information on their application for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These schools exemplify some of the most successful programs in the 
California educational system," said Acting State Supt. of Public Instruction 
William D. Dawson. "They deserve congratulations from the people of California 
for their achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to doing well on state aptitude tests, Newhart School was rated 
highly for its curriculum. The school also participates in an intergenerational 
exchange program called "Kids and Seniors Together" with the neighboring city 
senior center. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; OWNERS, CITY WORK ON INDUSTRIAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no confusing the city's manicured residential villages and gleaming 
office towers with Construction Circle, a heavy industrial district off 
Jamboree Road that is home to a rock-crushing plant and waste-hauling 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 And industrial business owners want keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 So they are working with city officials to develop what amounts to a 
preservation plan for the area that proponents hope will protect Construction 
Circle as residential development sprouts up nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The business leaders fear that noise and traffic generated by the industrial 
operations will one day bring protests from residents who move into the area -- 
a situation that has forced industrial firms in other cities to leave for more 
isolated locals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tries to give them a life expectancy," City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
said of the development agreement that's being hammered out. "It says that 
these businesses should not be forced out." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials began working on the agreement earlier this year after the City 
Council approved construction of a 200-bed single room occupancy hotel across 
the street from Construction Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby firms opposed the SRO project, fearing hotel residents would complain 
about noise and pollution from Construction Circle and force reductions in 
working hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The council expressed sympathy for the business owners' concerns and added a 
requirement to the SRO project that forces operators to inform prospective 
tenants that they would live next to an industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also directed staffers to work with the businesses on a city pact 
that gives owners a measure of a security about their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement being discussed would guarantee that existing zoning regulations 
stay in place at Construction Circle for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft document states the council's opposition to any new "burdensome" 
regulations on the firms. It also supports their right to expand if they met 
all local, state and federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to protect them," Mayor Michael Ward said after the SRO vote. "I 
think they can coexist" with residents of the SRO. 
</P>
<P>
 City staffers are now working with the businesses to finalize the agreement, 
which is expected to come before the council for a final vote later this 
summer. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; TEXT OF MEASURES ON WALL OKD FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Directors of the Rossmoor Community Services District have moved closer to 
putting the issue of the Rossmoor perimeter wall on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 4-1 vote last week, directors approved the text of two ballot measures 
that would be presented to the voters on the wall. One would make the district 
responsible for repair and maintenance of the wall and the other would impose a 
special property tax to pay for such work. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the two measures are linked, and both would need to 
pass to ensure the upkeep of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Joyce Bloom dissented, reiterating her position that private owners 
of the wall, as well as the cities of Los Alamitos and Seal Beach, should 
maintain the wall, and not the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/2-mile red, brick wall, which was built in 1959, has become an 
emotional issue to residents of this community, who consider the wall a 
historical landmark for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, members of the Rossmoor Homeowners Assn., who have been behind 
the effort to repair the wall, said that sections of the aging structure are 
also in danger of toppling and could hurt children. 
</P>
<P>
 But directors have resisted the efforts because of the cost of repairing and 
maintaining the wall. Last year, they decided to put the issue to the voters 
after a survey by the homeowners group indicated that a majority of the 
residents want the wall preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem was that several agencies, including Seal Beach and Los 
Alamitos, which owns sections of the wall, have refused to take responsibility 
for its repair, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Los Alamitos and Seal Beach are now willing to give up 
their sections to the district. But district General Manager Bill Sheldon said 
that parts of the wall may be inside private land. 
</P>
<P>
 "One property owner could sabotage the whole thing," Sheldon said last week. 
He said a survey would be conducted to determine what sections of the wall are 
in public and private properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's vote was preliminary, and the board will consider in July the 
final wording of the ballot question, including the arguments for and against 
the proposals, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An impartial analysis of the measures would also appear on the ballot, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Wynder, the district's attorney, said that the measure asking voters 
if they want the district to take over the wall needs a simple majority to 
pass. But the measure imposing a special tax needs a two-thirds majority, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon, the general manager, had said that preliminary studies indicate that 
it would take a onetime assessment of about $15 from the community's 3,555 
parcels to create a fund for the wall's repair and maintenance.BERT ELJERA

MAN IS JAILED AFTER ALLEGED GUN BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who fled after trading shots with an officer answering a 911 call at a 
residence here early Sunday surrendered later, authorities said. No one was 
injured in the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Eakin, 25, whose hometown was not immediately known, was arrested on 
suspicion of attempted murder after fleeing from a residence about 2 a.m. at 
the 100 block of West Avenida Cordoba, said Orange County sheriff's Lt. Joseph 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the first officer arrived," Davis said, "the suspect was in a front yard 
and started shooting at the deputy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the suspect repeatedly fired a handgun, Davis said, and the officer 
returned fire. However, neither the officer nor Eakin was hit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies had responded to a call from a woman who dialed 911 and said a man 
with a gun was at her residence. 
</P>
<P>
 After the brief gunfight, the suspect ran into the residence and fled through 
a rear door, Davis said. Eakin threw away the gun and hopped over a rear fence, 
prompting a "major search" of the neighborhood, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eakin later turned himself in, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to Orange County Jail.

2 MEMBERS OF ACTON-AGUA DULCE SCHOOL BOARD FACE RECALL BID; EDUCATION: LAURIE 
BROWNING, JOYCE FIELD ARE ACCUSED OF MISMANAGING PLANS FOR A NEW HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the tiny Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District, two board members have 
been notified that a recall campaign has been initiated against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Laurie Browning and member Joyce Field were informed Thursday 
that the action was taken because of steps they took concerning a proposed new 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 people signed the recall notices, but that's enough to begin the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Duzick, one of those who signed, said that Browning and Field had 
previously promised there was a fully improved high school site available to 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district bought the site, but Duzick said the property still lacks such 
basics as water and sewer services. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said Browning and Field support the formation of a 
$25.5-million Mello-Roos special tax-assessment district to pay for the 
school's construction. She said this would impose an annual levy as high as 
$195 on property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to (form) a Mello-Roos, and we don't even have (an acceptable) site 
yet," Duzick said. "There doesn't seem to be any organization or plan as to how 
this money is going to be spent." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board is still holding hearings on the formation of the assessment 
district, and Browning and Field noted Thursday night that its value is still 
subject to debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Field, who received the recall notice during a hearing on the assessment 
district Thursday night, said she was shocked. "People are so afraid that 
things are going to go the way we want them, instead of the way they want 
them," she said, "they thought pulling out a couple of members might do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The notices accuse the two of "not acting for the good of the entire district" 
and "subordinating the education of children and youth to a partisan principal 
group interest" and/or to their "own personal ambition." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being personally attacked by a group that doesn't want the school in 
that area and doesn't want the tax," said Browning. "There are many, many 
people that want this high school built as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Field and Browning have until Thursday to file a response to the notice, and 
then the group seeking to oust them must have their recall petition approved by 
the county clerk. Then the group can start collecting signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The signatures of 25% of the 5,865 registered voters in the school district 
must be collected before a recall election is held. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to lose my job," said Browning. "I love my job. I'm really doing 
the best I can."

MEXICAN REBELS REJECT PEACE PLAN; LATIN AMERICA: ACTION BY INDIANS SPOTLIGHTS 
POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY AS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NEARS. BUT BOTH SIDES INSIST 
THEY WILL HONOR CEASE-FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indian rebels overwhelmingly rejected the Mexican government's peace proposal, 
saying that it does not fulfill their political, economic and social demands, 
but both sides rushed to provide assurances Sunday that resumed fighting is 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection puts the government in a tight spot two months before the Aug. 
21 presidential elections. Despite a 6-month-old cease fire, the rebellion -- 
which began New Year's Day in the southern state of Chiapas and left at least 
145 people dead -- is a sign of continuing potential for instability in a 
country whose leaders have tried to portray it as an emerging economic force. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebellion is a reminder of the impoverished rural communities that have 
been left out of Mexico's widely acclaimed economic modernization. It is also a 
reminder that Mexicans might seek to express their will if the party that has 
ruled Mexico for 65 years tries to maintain control through vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel leaders had hinted earlier that the proposal, made in March after nine 
days of negotiations, probably would not be acceptable to the rank-and-file 
members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army. A Zapatista delegation 
signed the proposal on the condition that its final approval was subject to a 
vote of everyone who supported the insurrection, the estimated 3,000 fighters 
as well as about 20,000 suspected civilian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 After a complex consultation process, nearly 98% of those voting rejected the 
proposal, according to three rebel communiques dated Saturday. Fewer than 4% of 
the voters said they wanted to resume combat, and the communiques said the 
Zapatistas would fight only if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The government responded by trying to allay fears. President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari said in a statement that the Mexican army will continue to observe a 
cease-fire in effect since Jan. 12. Peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis returned 
immediately to Chiapas to try to reopen peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels said they wanted a broader, national coalition to discuss issues that 
they say are important across Mexico. For that reason, they rejected the 
continuing intermediation of Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the historical shortsightedness of the supreme government 
prevents it from seeing that failure to submit to the drive for democracy will 
bring painful confrontations with predictable consequences for the nation," one 
of the rebel communiques stated. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier interview, rebel spokesman Subcommander Marcos had said that the 
Zapatistas have received letters of support from Indian and human rights groups 
throughout the country and that they would like to include those groups in 
future talks. 
</P>
<P>
 After they briefly invaded several county seats near the Guatemalan border on 
Jan. 1, the rebels presented a list of 10 areas of contention: work, land, 
housing, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and 
peace. They then withdrew into a despoiled area of the Lacandon Rain Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The government replied with a 32-point plan that largely ignored demands for 
democracy, liberty and justice, focusing on economic issues in the area under 
rebel control. Separately, Mexico's three major political parties negotiated a 
political and electoral reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista delegates explained the government proposal during a long 
meeting in four indigenous languages with representatives of villages under 
their control. The representatives then took the proposals to their villages 
for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters were allowed to watch the first phase of the consultations but could 
not be present for the voting in the villages. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels also said that they will allow voting in August in the areas they 
control, which is roughly 17% of one Mexican congressional district, in a sign 
that they expect the renewed talks to drag on through the presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not clear whether voting would be legal there because the deadline 
for picking up voter credentials was Sunday and citizens in rebel territory 
have been unable to get credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials had said earlier that they probably will call a special 
election in that district.

FAMED RABBI'S FUNERAL DRAWS THOUSANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN and LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stricken followers of Rabbi Menachem Schneerson bore his plain pine coffin on 
their shoulders Sunday before he was interred with simple prayers in a small 
cemetery in Queens. Around the world, disciples of the charismatic leader of 
the ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher movement greeted his passing with tears, songs, 
hope and disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his supporters believed the rabbi, with his full white beard and 
piercing blue eyes, was the Messiah. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately three months after he suffered a stroke, Schneerson, the seventh 
in a line of Lubavitcher rebbes dating back to 18th-Century Russia and a force 
in modern Israeli politics, died early Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in 
Manhattan. He was 92, childless and, for the moment, left no clear successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there is no one, as they say, in the dugout who will take the 
place of this great leader," said Rabbi Shea Hecht, an important figure in the 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, a siren sounded moments after Schneerson's 
death at 1:50 a.m. EDT and hundreds of the rabbi's followers gathered in 
pre-dawn darkness in front of the red-brick Lubavitcher headquarters. Others 
surged first to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of the funeral almost 15 hours later, their numbers had swollen to 
thousands in Brooklyn -- a sea of Hasidic men in traditional black felt hats 
and black coats, mothers wheeling baby carriages, young children in their best 
clothes, a teen-ager dressed in black on roller skates. Many were red-eyed from 
lack of sleep and weeping. 
</P>
<P>
 As word spread around the globe, supporters in Israel, France and Britain 
chartered planes and rushed to the funeral. Rabbi Chaim Mentz said when he 
reached the airport in Los Angeles 45 minutes after hearing the rabbi was dead, 
he was amazed to find 500 people scrambling for tickets to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A long line of the rebbe's followers filed into the headquarters building to 
look through a half-open door and catch a glimpse of his body, lying in his 
study and covered by a white cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands, some crying hysterically, surged forward to touch the coffin when 
it finally emerged from the building and was placed in a van for the trip under 
heavy police escort to the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some walked 10 miles to the cemetery where Schneerson, who through word of 
mouth and satellite communications transformed an isolated sect to an important 
force in Judaism, was interred in a small granite mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 men climbed on top of the mausoleum, open at the center, to have a 
better view. 
</P>
<P>
 After the interment, Lubavitchers were allowed into the mausoleum single-file. 
But many of Schneerson's followers became impatient, and police had trouble 
maintaining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Three officers and two Lubavitchers suffered minor injuries when crowds surged 
forward, and two Lubavitchers were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kfar Habad, the Israeli village where followers of the rabbi's Habad 
movement built a meticulous replica of his Brooklyn headquarters, people 
danced, drank vodka and refused to believe reports that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the Messiah. He's not dead," one said. "It's a test of our faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of miles away, that sentiment was echoed over and over by many on 
Eastern Parkway. Although he never claimed to be the Moshiach (pronounced 
Mo-she-ah), or Messiah, many of the rabbi's followers stoutly believed he was 
the person chosen to revitalize Judaism and bring peace, prosperity and heaven 
on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneerson suffered a stroke March 10 -- his second in two years -- and his 
condition steadily worsened. His first stroke in 1992 had left him unable to 
speak and partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebbe's death -- to the end an incomprehensible occurrence to his most 
zealous followers -- left the movement without a leader. It also leaves them 
with the prospect of a tumultuous time of disillusionment and change before a 
new rebbe assumes leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Schneerson's followers believed that because the rebbe was the 
promised Messiah, he would not die before world peace was established, all Jews 
gathered in Israel, and the Temple in Jerusalem -- destroyed in 70 C.E. (common 
era) -- was rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will happen now is the continuation of the same," said one of the 
rebbe's advisers who spoke Sunday on the condition his name not be used. "We 
don't know. You have to engage in willing suspension of disbelief. The rebbe's 
life was full of miracles." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to persist," the adviser said. "What form will that take? 
Whatever form it requires. We'll find a way to clear away the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
 For other Jews -- both religious and secular -- who discounted the messianic 
claims and saw in some of Schneerson's pronouncements unwelcome meddling in the 
political affairs of Israel, his passing will close a controversial chapter in 
Jewish life. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1902, Schneerson was the seventh Lubavitcher rebbe since Rabbi Shneur 
Zalman, the founder. Schneerson was trained as an engineer at the University of 
Berlin and the Sorbonne. In 1929, he married the second daughter of the sixth 
Lubavitcher rebbe. Both he and his wife, Chaya Moussia, who died in 1988, are 
great-great-grandchildren of the third Lubavitcher rebbe.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, he emigrated to the United States. Then, in 1951, he succeeded his 
father-in-law, Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneersohn as rebbe.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the movement, which was decimated during World War II and the Nazi 
Holocaust, has become one of the world's most influential Hasidic sects. Its 
annual budget has been conservatively estimated by one of the rebbe's 
secretaries at $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates differ on its membership. While Rabbi Baruch Y. Hecht, associate 
director of Habad of California, puts the number at between 300,000 and 350,000 
worldwide, one authority outside the movement, Prof. Samuel C. Heilman of 
Queens College of the City University of New York, said there are no more than 
35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the number, Schneerson built up a movement whose influence went far 
beyond the confines of its seemingly insular Crown Heights neighborhood of 
Brooklyn, where devout men, or Hasidim, strictly observe the traditional dress 
code of beards and curled sideburns, and black flat-topped felt hats and black 
suits. (Not all Hasidim, however, are Schneerson followers.) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the rebbe created a sensation that divided the Jewish world when he 
nearly succeeded in amending Israel's Law of Return to require that all who 
convert to Judaism follow Orthodox tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before Israeli elections, his movement engaged in overt politicking 
that resulted in five candidates for the small but ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel 
party winning seats in the Knesset. When those seats were combined with those 
held by another small ultra-Orthodox party, Shas, they became the fulcrum on 
which the balance of power shifted between Israel's two major parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot was that then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir won the endorsement of 
both parties -- after acceding to the rebbe's views on the Law of Return. 
Ultimately, however, the Knesset rejected any change in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, to the consternation of some Israeli officials, the rebbe vigorously 
reasserted his opposition to any suggestion that Israel cede land to the 
Palestinians in exchange for peace -- just when peace talks began to intensify. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years the debate over whether Schneerson had acknowledged that he 
was the long-awaited Messiah divided his followers and drew dismay -- and at 
times scorn -- from Jews outside the sect. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Jewish theologians have held that a potential Messiah is born every 
generation. Unlike the Christian belief that Jesus as Messiah was both God and 
man, the Messiah expected by Hasidic Jews is entirely human. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last several years, many of Schneerson's followers fervently urged him 
to reveal himself as the Messiah to bring about the long hoped-for messianic 
age. His most zealous followers argued that he did that when he nodded his 
assent as they sang a messianic song, "King Moshiach," last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebbe's closest confidants, noting that he had suffered a stroke and 
it was hard to say what he may have intended, were adamant in discounting such 
claims. They did, however, acknowledge that Schneerson would definitely be a 
leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Schneerson himself reportedly rejected pleas to reveal himself 
as Messiah. "I know what my work is. Don't give me new assignments," he told 
followers in 1991, according to a book by Jerome R. Mintz, a professor of 
anthropology and Jewish studies at Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their differences over whether Schneerson had publicly acknowledged 
his messiahship, all Lubavitchers revered him and believed that he was the 
expected one. They worked fervently to bring about the messianic age when 
Schneerson would unmistakably reveal himself as King Moshiach. 
</P>
<P>
 They redoubled their efforts in 1991, when Schneerson said he had done all 
that he could to bring about the messianic era. Schneerson told his followers 
that it was up to them and all Jews to ask what they could do to hasten the 
Messiah's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a reinvigorated and almost unheard of effort in Judaism, aimed 
at proselytization and bringing lapsed Jews back into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 As Schneerson grew older, such efforts intensified. Last year, for example, 
his adherents paid for billboards in Southern California that said "Discover 
Moshiach." 
</P>
<P>
 What effect his death has on the movement and the morale of his followers is 
uncertain. Last year, in an interview with The Times, Mintz said 
disillusionment was inevitable. "Everyone has worked themselves up to a frenzy 
now," he said. "Of course, they're going to be doomed to disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 Heilman disagreed. He said that while some followers on the edges may fall 
away, those in the core group will declare that they must be even more faithful 
than ever because of Schneerson's death.

POLICE UNION ACCUSES MAYOR OF INTERFERENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Protective League accused Mayor Richard Riordan on 
Sunday of putting "tremendous personal pressure" on the mediator in the police 
pay dispute to rescind a recommendation he reportedly made for a 9% pay 
increase and reopen mediation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mediator, John M. Caraway, sharply denied that he had been pressured 
and called news reports that he had made such a recommendation "factually 
incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 Several sources in the dispute said Friday that Caraway, of the state 
Mediation and Conciliation Service, had recommended police pay increases 
totaling 9% over the next 18 months, along with $1,000 "signing bonuses" for 
all officers and additional stipends for those who work patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 But an exchange of statements Sunday indicated that while the police union was 
anxious to lock in such a settlement, city officials -- and the mediator 
himself -- insisted that any terms discussed did not constitute a final 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual public statement for a mediator in labor negotiations, Caraway 
said he had "discussed a wide range of possible solutions" to the protracted 
pay dispute, but had informed both parties that he will not make a final 
recommendation of his own "unless both parties ask me to." 
</P>
<P>
 And while he did not deny having a conversation Saturday with Riordan, Caraway 
said: "I can assure you I'm not an easy person to pressure. This is an ongoing 
process and I'm not aware that I have been pressured by anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Caraway was reached for comment at a Los Angeles hotel after the Police 
Protective League issued a statement that declared: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Caraway has been under tremendous personal pressure from Mayor Riordan, 
whom, it is our understanding, spoke with Mr. Caraway for over an hour on 
Saturday to pressure him to rescind his obligation to present his final 
recommendation, and attempt to return to the mediation process. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is in fact true, this action on the part of the Mayor is tantamount 
to jury tampering, irrevocably tainting the whole mediation process. . . . We 
are discussing with legal experts the possibility of demanding an investigation 
by the Attorney General into this matter of tampering with the settlement 
adviser (Caraway) by Mayor Riordan, his staff and (the) City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 When Caraway was read the police union statement, he interjected: "That's 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Danny L. Staggs, the president of the Police Protective League, said later 
that it continues to be his understanding "that the mayor has put pressure on 
the mediator." 
</P>
<P>
 "If that has happened, I'm disgusted," Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the process was fine until the mayor interceded, that both 
sides had come to an agreement to be presented to the council on Tuesday," 
Staggs continued. "Everyone believed that the process had succeeded and that 
everyone had agreed. But when they learned about it, several council members 
were irate, and they prevailed on the mayor to pressure the mediator." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor William McCarley, reached at home, said that Riordan was out of 
town and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley said the Riordan Administration wants to keep the negotiating process 
confidential and that the Administration would have no further comment for now. 
</P>
<P>
 But two other ranking city officials -- both on the city's negotiating 
committee -- supported the Administration's argument that there had been no 
final 9% recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky accused the Police Protective League of trying 
to "use the press" in the matter. If any recommendation has been made calling 
for 9% hike -- and other payments -- "it will be dead on arrival" before the 
council, the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie said that, in fact, "there has been 
no recommendation" from Caraway and that he had been told by the mediator that 
he felt "he was put in a very awkward position" by news reports.

IN SOUTH-CENTRAL, CONCERNS RISE ON COMMUNITY POLICING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the same South-Central Los Angeles churches and community centers where 
residents are trying to craft a new brand of policing, a small but growing 
opposition movement also is taking hold, raising troubling questions for the 
most important experiment in the modern history of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mount Tabor Baptist Church recently, 40 residents groused about how the 
department is selecting community representatives and about the perception that 
it is dictating the terms of community-based policing rather than allowing 
residents to control it. At the Christian Community Church a few weeks later, 
the crowd was slightly smaller, but the complaints were much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need no captain, no deputy chief, no mayor to come out here and tell 
us what we need," said Walter Richardson, an energetic, wiry man who is the 
president of his local block club. "What we need is for the Police Department 
to listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The disaffected residents are neither radical nor, for the most part, 
anti-police. Many are solid, middle-class citizens with deep roots in their 
communities and a commitment to improving them. Some volunteer their time at 
their local police stations. In short, they are precisely the people the Police 
Department needs to make community-based policing a success. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, they are restless and concerned, many of them convinced that the LAPD 
is bent on building a booster organization rather than a vehicle for the 
community to exercise control over its police. They also fear that a network of 
civilian advisory boards -- which the department is now building as a mainstay 
of the community policing effort -- will have no real power to direct the way 
police patrol their neighborhoods. Several City Council members express similar 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 As the battle lines take shape, a pair of dynamic leaders -- Deputy Chief Mark 
Kroeker and longtime activist Anthony Thigpenn -- have squared off, each 
leading the charge for his own view of how community policing should best be 
organized and directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigpenn is an articulate, 40-year-old community organizer who heads a group 
called AGENDA -- short for Action for Grassroots Empowerment & Neighborhood 
Development Alternatives. One of the founders of the Coalition Against Police 
Abuse and a plaintiff in a landmark suit against police spying, Thigpenn has 
emerged as a leading critic of the way that community-based policing is 
unfolding in South Bureau. The process is being closely watched in that area 
because of the long history of troubled relations between residents and the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the current way that the program is being implemented, people are 
being set up for a huge disappointment," Thigpenn said recently. "Either it 
will be very superficial . . . or it will collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker, a 49-year-old deputy chief whose devotion to community policing has 
made him the Police Department's most visible proponent of the concept, can 
barely hide his exasperation with comments such as that. Nevertheless, he's 
determined to avoid a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for me to keep my own personal chagrin out of the dialogue," 
said Kroeker. But he insists that the criticism is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, Kroeker said, is being denied the chance to participate in 
community-based policing. No one, in his view, has any reason to be concerned. 
"The process, the membership, the access -- all of it is open to anyone," he 
said. To those who feel left out, he proposed: "Call me. I'll make sure that 
you are included." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Christian Community Church, several dozen residents stood shoulder to 
shoulder, bowed their heads and joined in a prayer to "make this the best 
community possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The prayer over, residents turned to Thigpenn and Ng'ethe Maina, another 
community organizer with AGENDA. The two of them stood before the group, 
dressed casually and armed with a stack of hand-drawn charts, and launched 
their explanation of why they believe that the LAPD's approach to community 
policing falls short. Their first point: The police advisory boards intended to 
represent residents are fundamentally flawed because police are choosing the 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can the boards represent the community if the LAPD picks the members of 
the boards?" asked Jeannette Hughes, president of the 91st, 92nd and 93rd 
Street block clubs. "Some of these people are good people, but they don't 
represent the community, they represent the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the group, five uniformed Los Angeles police officers interrupted them 
and politely defended the department's efforts to date. They explained that 
senior lead officers from South Bureau's four police stations have the job of 
finding block captains for every block of South-Central Los Angeles and members 
for dozens of the advisory boards. "There is a tremendous push on to locate 
block club captains," Officer Zim Williams told the residents at the church. 
"But there is no intent to leave a certain segment of the community out." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the question of who gets picked, there is a more fundamental 
disagreement lurking in the shadows of community policing: How much authority 
should the advisory boards have? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the department model, the answer to that question is relatively little. 
The advisory boards are conceived as just that -- advisory. They are to suggest 
problem areas for police to concentrate their efforts on, and they are to 
supply police with information that can help the department attack crime. In 
return, the department says it will arm advisory board members with 
crime-fighting information to help them help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As Officer Williams described it: "It is our desire to teach you guys how to 
deal with the small things, so that we can get back to arresting criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Compare that to Laura Smith's vision of community policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what we want, and we know what works. We live here," said Smith, who 
founded her local block club in 1982 because drug dealing in her neighborhood 
was driving her to distraction. "So we should have the authority to tell them 
what to do. After all, they work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say it's not that simple, and shudder at the prospect of 
dozens of advisory boards doling out conflicting orders to officers in 
different parts of the city. They say they have no intention of giving 
community boards the power to determine police tactics, to discipline officers 
or to dictate policies such as how police should treat suspects whom they stop. 
</P>
<P>
 But, critics ask, if the boards lack that authority, why bother with them at 
all? 
</P>
<P>
 "We firmly know that the community should not micro-manage, but we believe 
that it needs to be involved at all levels," said Thigpenn. "That includes 
tactics, misconduct and brutality." 
</P>
<P>
 Views such as that one reflect a basic philosophical difference with the 
department about what community policing is and what it is intended to achieve. 
Partly in response, the LAPD has turned to a popular tool of the marketing 
world, and is now meeting with focus groups across the city to get their takes 
on community policing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disagreements also grow out of something much simpler and much more 
volatile, something that no focus group could sway: The city's balance of 
power, particularly between the City Council and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that the council and the department, two of the 
city's central political institutions, have struggled for political power at 
each other's expense. In fact, the current battle for control over community 
policing has summoned forth echoes of a similar contest in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, community organizations under the wing of the department 
sprouted up throughout the city. Neighborhood Watch groups, police advisory 
boards and block clubs gained in number and stature. Within a few years of the 
program's birth, the Police Department had thousands of citizens meeting with 
its officers on a regular basis, building what amounted to its own political 
base in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ed Davis, now retired, oversaw that burgeoning group of 
volunteers. It was not long before he began to sense the discomfort that it was 
causing among political leaders in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any intent on my part to pick up political power with these 
groups," he said. "That happened, but that was not my goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky, who joined the City Council in 1976, accepts Davis' 
contention that community policing was not intended as a way to expand the 
Police Department's political influence. But, like Davis, he says it eventually 
did just that. 
</P>
<P>
 When a hot issue was before the City Council, the department's lead officers 
in community policing -- nicknamed "crows," after the police acronym for 
"community relations officers" -- would sometimes encourage their neighborhood 
groups to call their council members and express their views. Council members 
would be deluged with calls supporting budget increases for more vice officers 
or patrol cars, Yaroslavsky recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't always that effective, at least in my part of town," said 
Yaroslavsky, who represents the Westside. "But they had this cadre of 
supporters, people who would do whatever their CROs asked them to. . . . That 
helped make the police a powerful political force." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis conceived his model, known as "team policing," in 1969, when he was 
seeking to become chief. The city was still haunted by the 1965 Watts riots, 
tension between the Police Department and minority communities was high, and 
morale within the LAPD was low. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a different riot haunts the LAPD, but it similarly affects every aspect 
of the organization. Racial tension is high, officer morale low, some say lower 
than at any point since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis proposed his version of community policing as a way of mending the 
relationship between the Police Department and the city it served. The idea 
then, as now, was that better relations would help police to solve crime and 
residents to recapture a sense of safety and well-being in their neighborhoods. 
The method then, as now, was to involve the Police Department in a broader 
range of services, encouraging its officers to attack crime in part by linking 
social service organizations and striving to improve the quality of life in the 
neighborhoods they patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, as in Davis' era, some contend that if the Police Department succeeds 
in building widespread community support and in delivering services to 
residents, it might weaken the City Council's importance to its constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely political," said Thigpenn, whose office is lined with 
butcher-block paper charts that trace the history of community organization and 
grass-roots political organizing. "There's this huge apparatus that's being set 
up by this important institution, the Los Angeles Police Department. That 
affects power relations between the City Council, the community and the 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 As they make their case for a new approach to community policing, Thigpenn and 
his group are closely allied with Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. He shares 
their sense of the program's political implications. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this program, the department can potentially endear a network of 
community residents and cause them to be more closely aligned with the 
political interests of the department," said Ridley-Thomas, a leading critic of 
how the LAPD is proceeding with community-based policing. "You think they would 
resist the temptation of exploiting that relationship they are building on an 
issue that is important to them? I can tell you, they already are using that 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas and other LAPD critics, such as Councilman Richard Alarcon, have 
proposed at least one concrete change in the department's community policing 
program. They want their staffs to be represented on the community police 
advisory boards. Police Chief Willie L. Williams, whose top advisers served 
under Davis and worry about the encroachment of politics into policing, has so 
far refused, although he also has said he ultimately will defer to the 
council's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he sympathizes with Williams' predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a politician starts getting involved, you know where that leads," said 
Davis. "If a politician is in Neighborhood Watch, he wants the glory of it. The 
whole idea is to build the propinquity between a police officer and the people 
he serves, not between a police officer and his councilman." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fear is not just of politics twisting policing. It is equally about 
police exerting inappropriate political influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the police tell a council member that he or his staff is not welcome at 
a meeting, they better have a reason," Yaroslavsky said. "I can't conceive of a 
good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can Ridley-Thomas. He has appeared at public forums to raise his concerns 
and has clashed with the department over who deserves credit for certain 
projects in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about control," Ridley-Thomas said. "About who will control this 
process. . . . If, in fact, community-based policing is to be the critical 
element in causing this department to be reformed as well as transformed, it 
would seem to me that this department has a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the small band seeking to alter the course of the LAPD's grand 
experiment also see a tough road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Tuesday evening, a few of AGENDA's die-hard supporters gathered in 
its tidy Vermont Avenue offices to brainstorm about community policing and to 
plot the organization's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigpenn, Maina and another AGENDA organizer, Adrianne Shropshire, sketched 
out a plan of action, soliciting suggestions from a number of concerned 
community members and asking them to rate the effectiveness of various ideas. 
Together, they discussed tactics for persuading the LAPD to change its 
approach, starting with a request that the department convene a mass meeting 
where residents could air their concerns and suggest changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make them see that they have something to gain from this," said 
Aladean Markham, a block club member from the Baldwin Vista area. "They get a 
better attitude from the community, and that could help them do their jobs. It 
could even save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen people, gathered in a semicircle on folding chairs, nodded in 
agreement. But they admitted that they are not sure whether they can get the 
Police Department to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Maina sketched a slope to represent the hill that organizers 
must climb to make their case. Now, he said, the organizing efforts had pushed 
the campaign about a third of the way up. But there was a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Questions?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Markham spoke up: "I think you should make the hill steeper."

CLINTON MAY OK PHASED-IN HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening the door to a possible compromise on health care legislation, senior 
White House officials said Sunday that President Clinton would not insist on 
having health insurance coverage for every American immediately if Congress 
agreed to phase it in over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements by White House counselor David Gergen and Harold M. Ickes, the 
deputy chief of staff, seemed designed to break a logjam in Congress, which is 
running weeks behind schedule in crafting health care reform. Their remarks 
also came a day after Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) attacked any 
universal coverage plan this year that required businesses to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gergen and Ickes said a "triggering mechanism" compromise being pushed by 
Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) might be a way out of the congressional morass, but 
they declined to endorse a specific alternate approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Breaux's plan, by the years 1999, 2000 or 2001, if a certain percentage 
of uninsured people had not been covered through marketplace reforms, there 
would be a gradual phase-in of the so-called employer mandates requiring 
businesses to pay 80% of insurance coverage for their workers. His plan would 
give incentives to businesses to provide coverage for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's insistence on employer mandates to pay for health care reform has 
drawn widespread opposition from business groups, particularly from small 
businesses, and from many Republicans as well as some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux, a key player in health care reform as a ranking member of the Senate 
Finance Committee, said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that his triggering plan 
could be phased in over a three- to five-year period, which "would not be an 
unnecessary burden on employers and businesses and yet provide insurance for 
all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 "By phasing in these requirements, I think we'll have a chance to reform the 
marketplace," he said. "It doesn't do us any good to mandate something until 
we've reformed it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dole called such triggers "the biggest gimmick in town." He said they 
would only delay the eventual onset of employer mandates, and that such 
mandates would hurt small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to have a mandate, just say you're going to have a mandate," 
he said on CNN's "Late Edition." "Don't try to, you know, gloss it up, cover it 
up, paint it up or something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said Saturday in Boston that he would oppose any bill mandating that 
employers pay for workers' health insurance. On Sunday he said some had 
misconstrued his comments as threatening a filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean I'm going to fight the bill and try to change it, try to amend it, try 
to clarify it, try to knock out employer mandates," he said. "It may be so bad 
you'd have to end up in a filibuster, but certainly we're not at that point 
yet. We're a long way from deciding any strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," Gergen said Clinton, who threatened in 
January to veto any bill that did not provide health insurance for all 
Americans, would accept a congressional guarantee "that there will be universal 
coverage down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's said all along he thinks his bill is the best way to get 
there," Gergen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if there are other ways to get there, as long as they get to universal 
(coverage), there are many roads to Rome in this situation," Gergen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ickes, who has helped direct the White House effort for health care reform, 
said on NBC: "As long as universal coverage within a reasonable time is 
provided, I think the President will sign that bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux called upon the White House to get more actively involved as Congress 
eyes an early adjournment to take part in political campaigning this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need your major players out there trying to get it done," he said. "I 
mean, people like (Treasury Secretary) Lloyd Bentsen and (White House Chief of 
Staff) Mack McLarty. The President is engaged and the First Lady's engaged, but 
they need a team effort here. And we're in the fourth quarter and they need to 
be involved now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, appealing for bipartisan support for health care reform, said: "I 
trust that in the end, Bob Dole and the Republicans . . . will want to be 
constructive in trying to get this done." 
</P>
<P>
 On the House side, Gergen had warm praise for Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
who stepped aside as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee on May 31 after 
he was indicted on 17 federal charges of political corruption and misuse of his 
office funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the panel must play a key role in health care reform, Gergen said 
of Rostenkowski: "He's been a very strong and staunch ally of health care, and 
he'll continue to be that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, asked on the CBS program if his indictment would hurt Clinton's 
chances of passing his health reform bill, said: "That's a decision that will 
have to be made by my constituency. . . . I will fight as hard as I can to get 
the bill out of the committee and onto the floor of the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about charges in the indictment that he had 14 "ghost employees" on his 
payroll, some of whom performed personal chores like mowing his lawn and 
photographing his daughters' weddings, Rostenkowski said: 
</P>
<P>
 "In Chicago, we have very unusual associations with people that work for us, 
they are our friends as well." The employees worked "40 hours a week for the 
government."

U.S., CHINA COORDINATED POLICY DURING COLD WAR; DIPLOMACY: WASHINGTON, BEIJING 
WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS IN WORKING AGAINST MOSCOW, ACCORDING TO CIA STUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It began on the edges of President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Feb. 23, 1972, Henry A. Kissinger, then Nixon's national 
security adviser, briefed Chinese officials on troop deployments by China's 
chief rival, the Soviet Union, near their common northern border, according to 
a secret history of U.S.-China relations done for U.S. intelligence agencies. 
In Shanghai four days later, he gave Chinese officials another military 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset of the Nixon Administration's opening to China, the study 
shows, Washington and Beijing went to extraordinary lengths to cooperate with 
one another against Moscow, the Cold War nemesis of the United States. On 
high-level visits, they regularly shared intelligence and teamed up in devising 
anti-Soviet strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations in 1973, the study further shows, the Americans promised 
Chinese officials that they would not vote with the Soviet Union and against 
China on any major issue. And before and after U.S. summit meetings with the 
Soviets throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, U.S. officials briefed China on 
the agenda, discussions and results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can work together to commonly deal with a bastard," Chinese leader Mao 
Tse-tung told Kissinger in February, 1973, in a reference to the Soviet Union. 
That quote -- taken from the first transcripts of top-level conversations 
between U.S. and Chinese leaders ever made public -- captured, in Mao's feisty 
way, the heart of the U.S.-China relationship during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean working together was easy. In fact, Chinese and U.S. 
officials often mistrusted one another. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Premier Chou En-lai accused the United States of trying to "stand on 
Chinese shoulders" to confront the Soviet Union, according to the study. And 
Mao quickly took this idea a step further, claiming that the secret aim of the 
United States and its European allies was "to push Russia eastward, mainly 
against us and Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the history -- prepared by the Santa Monica-based RAND think tank -- 
shows that the United States and China sought each other's help on foreign 
policy issues around the world. On Jan. 23, 1974, for example, Kissinger told 
the Chinese that Egypt was very unhappy in its relations with the Soviet Union 
and asked China for help in building a factory to make MIG-21 warplanes in 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War dynamics changed after the U.S. defeat in Vietnam. During the 
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter administrations, China's top leaders, including 
Deng Xiaoping, regularly goaded and implored the United States to be tougher 
with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Soviets went on a large-scale offensive in Angola, and we believe this 
was caused by the weak attitude you adopted . . . toward the Soviets," Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua was quoted as lecturing Kissinger in October, 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, Mr. Foreign Minister, I don't want to be impolite, but I don't 
agree," Kissinger replied. "We are not weak. Rather we are temporarily weak 
until after our (presidential) elections. . . . But that will end on Nov. 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Angola and Zaire were among several African countries where civil wars and 
disorder became swept up in Cold War-style confrontations as the United States, 
the Soviet Union and China backed their own factions. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Carter Administration, which in its early years was trying to 
conclude arms control agreements with Moscow, the Chinese seemed to be almost 
incendiary. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1977, when Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance said he had heard 
Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua would be visiting Kinshasa, Zaire, on his 
way home from the United States, Huang shot back, "You should go also . . . but 
I doubt you will -- you may be apprehensive of offending the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
 China's goading of the United States in this period, the intelligence study 
says, was designed to "make it more difficult for Moscow to direct its 
attention to China and (to) limit the possibilities for any coordinated 
U.S.-Soviet action against (China)." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Ronald Reagan Administration, by contrast, the roles were reversed. 
This time, the United States found itself urging China to take a tougher line 
toward the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1983 visit to Beijing, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger warned 
Chinese officials about the Soviet threat and urged China to stop treating the 
two superpowers on equal terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Under President Reagan, the study concludes, Chinese leaders "decided to seek 
to reduce the level of Sino-Soviet hostility . . . to deflate Soviet pressures 
against them and also to avoid being caught in the middle of the deteriorating 
Soviet-American relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 The intelligence study contains much other new information about U.S. foreign 
policy. Here are some of the other subjects: TAIWAN 
</P>
<P>
 The history shows that on the first day of Kissinger's first visit to Beijing, 
on July 9, 1971, he secretly gave Chou a promise that the United States would 
not support the Taiwan Independence Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 That movement, propelled by some of the indigenous Taiwanese who make up about 
80% of the island's population, argued that Taiwan should be considered a 
separate country. By contrast, Taiwan's Nationalist regime, then headed by Gen. 
Chiang Kai-shek, claimed that it was the government for all of China and that 
Taiwan was part of China. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's interesting, because Kissinger's line has been that China didn't 
really care about Taiwan (during the early days of the U.S. opening to China), 
that all they cared about was strategic cooperation against the Russians," 
Harry Harding, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of a 
leading book on U.S.-China relations, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the intelligence history, Kissinger also told Chou then that the 
United States would reduce its forces on Taiwan as U.S. relations with China 
improved and that U.S. recognition of the Beijing government could come in 
Nixon's second term. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these early commitments is mentioned in Kissinger's memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chou and I by tacit agreement did not press controversial issues," Kissinger 
wrote. "Taiwan was mentioned only briefly during the first session." CAMBODIA 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the intelligence study shows, the United 
States frequently coordinated its policy on Cambodia with China. The Chinese 
government was backing the Khmer Rouge, the radical Communist faction under 
whose leadership more than 1 million Cambodians were murdered or starved to 
death between 1975 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States appears to have raised the subject of Khmer Rouge atrocities 
during a visit to Beijing by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national 
security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the history released by the CIA, Chinese Foreign Minister Huang 
bluntly told Brzezinski on May 20, 1978, that "the United States is not 
qualified to raise the human rights issue regarding Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
 After Vietnam invaded Cambodia and installed a new government there, Huang 
informed then-Defense Secretary Harold Brown in Beijing on Jan. 7, 1980, that 
China would support a coalition resistance organization under the leadership of 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk "only if the Pol Pot forces are included." Pol Pot was 
-- and by most accounts remains today -- the leader of the Khmer Rouge. KOREA 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Chinese leaders also regularly discussed the future of the two 
Koreas. 
</P>
<P>
 The intelligence study shows that in the October, 1974, meeting with Foreign 
Minister Qiao in New York City, Kissinger hinted that the United States might 
cut China out of its role as intermediary between the United States and North 
Korea. Kissinger claimed that the North Koreans had been trying to contact him 
through other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 1979 visit to the United States, Deng told Carter that North Korea 
trusted China "and we cannot have contact with the South (Korea) or it will 
weaken that trust." He also assured Carter that North Korea would not attack 
the South even if all U.S. troops were withdrawn from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Those assurances underscore what has changed and what has not on the Korean 
peninsula. China and South Korea established diplomatic relations two years 
ago. The United States decided not to withdraw its troops from the peninsula. 
But the worries of war or an invasion by North Korea are as alive today as they 
were 15 years ago. TRADE 
</P>
<P>
 The intelligence study says that the Nixon Administration began talking as 
early as 1973 about the possibility of granting China most-favored-nation trade 
benefits -- the privileges under which its goods enter the United States under 
the same low duties as those of most other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 At times in those early days, China did not seem too interested. On Oct. 22, 
1974, Deng told Kissinger in Beijing that China did not need most-favored 
status if the Soviets did not get it. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of the 1970s, China was pushing hard for the trade benefits. 
During a trip to Washington on Jan. 31, 1979, Deng met with the entire Cabinet 
of the Carter Administration. He said that if China got most-favored status, 
China's trade with the United States should surpass its trade with Japan. 
Moreover, he said, U.S.-China trade should be 10 times larger than U.S. trade 
with Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want your most up-to-date technology -- not even that of the early 1970s, 
do you understand?" Deng thundered to the Cabinet members at that 1979 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Carter Administration's support, China got most-favored status the 
following year, more than a decade before the privileges were extended to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of Deng's predictions have been borne out. In 1993, U.S. trade with 
China slightly exceeded $40 billion, almost exactly the same as the United 
States' trade with Taiwan. But as Deng forecast, that was higher than China's 
trade with Japan, $38 billion last year. CHINESE POLITICS 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the period covered by the intelligence history, U.S. leaders were 
often forced to deal with the vicissitudes of China's domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 On the very first Kissinger visit, for example, Chou hinted at the tensions 
between Mao and his designated successor, Lin Piao. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would also like to take the opportunity to say we express thanks for the 
gifts which the President and you have sent to Chairman Mao, Lin Piao and 
myself," Chou said. "You may say that Chairman Mao and I both send our regards 
to President Nixon," pointedly leaving out Lin's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, Lin died in a plane crash in Mongolia after what Chinese 
officials said had been an assassination attempt against Mao. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, then-President Reagan met in China with Communist Party General 
Secretary Hu Yaobang, then Deng's second in command. According to the study, Hu 
told Reagan that there was no need for Americans to fear political chaos in 
China after Deng's death because a second echelon of leaders was being trained. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, this "second echelon" was headed by Hu himself and by Premier 
Zhao Ziyang. As it turned out, however, Hu was ousted from office in 1987, Zhao 
was forced out in 1989, and the concern about what will happen in China after 
Deng is at least as strong today as it was a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The intelligence study concluded that, over the years, one of China's 
occasional negotiating tactics was to tell U.S. leaders "that if they do not 
meet certain Chinese political needs in a negotiation, their 'old friends' in 
the (Chinese) political system will lose their influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, U.S. officials have been told that if they do not make 
concessions, the result would be to hurt Chou or Deng or China's reformers. The 
intelligence study calls this ploy, "Your Chinese friends are in trouble." 
DETENTE'S DIALOGUE 
</P>
<P>
 SUBJECT: Formal diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 OCCASION: President Carter sent National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski 
to Beijing on open talks. 
</P>
<P>
 DATE: May, 1978 
</P>
<P>
 Brzezinski: At the outset, I would like to express to you our determination to 
move forward on the process of normalization. I can say on behalf of President 
Carter that the United States has made up its mind on this issue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua: On the Chinese side, we have raised three 
conditions on normalization of relations between our two countries. . . . Let 
no one harbor any hope that the Chinese side will make any concessions in this 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Deng Xiaoping: You must be tired (from your long trip) 
</P>
<P>
 Brzezinski: I am exhilarated. 
</P>
<P>
 Deng: President Ford stated that if he were reelected he would move to full 
normalization according to the three conditions without any reservations. . . . 
We are looking forward to the day when President Carter makes up his mind. 
Let's now shift the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzezinski: I have told you before, President Carter has made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Deng: So much the better.

<P>
 Along the sunbaked macadam parking strips of Little Saigon, a candidate is 
stalking handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung Nguyen's hands are poised and his suit is pressed to the crisp corners 
of political correctness. His campaign manner is the proper blend of sincerity 
and enthusiasm, an attitude that endures even when a few Vietnamese American 
voters warily regard his extended hand like some limp fish at the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know what to do at first, because Asian leaders don't usually 
campaign that way," explained Nguyen, a 37-year-old computer programmer and a 
resident of Orange. "They seem really surprised that I'm running for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more stunning, perhaps, is that moderate politicians like Nguyen are 
speaking up and moving openly to take over the street corners of political 
ambition in Southern California's sizable Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 They sense that with them is a long-silent majority, which is acquiring 
citizenship, learning to vote and shifting attitudes. The passions of exile 
politics are cooling, as is the Vietnamese immigrant community's divisive, 
occasionally violent debate about dealings with the homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost two decades, political power in Southern California's Vietnamese 
community has been largely in the hands of ardent anti-Communists who claimed 
to speak for the refugees who settled here in waves after the fall of Saigon in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, it was heresy to express support for ties with Hanoi and -- in 
some cases -- suicidal to express public views remotely sympathetic to the 
Communist regime. Few people openly shared moderate opinions, which could be 
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet a new Times poll found that more than half the Vietnamese living in 
Southern California hold those very heretical views. Fifty-four percent favor 
full diplomatic relations with Vietnam as well as the recent lifting of trade 
sanctions, while only 20% voiced opposition to those moves. The survey of 861 
Vietnamese residents -- conducted between March 28 and April 19 -- has a 
sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those contacted for follow-up interviews conceded that they had been 
afraid to speak freely for fear of hurting war veterans or reopening old 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing for sure," said Thuy-Vy Luyen, 33, of Anaheim. "That is a 
very controversial issue. A lot of people think that if we do business with the 
Communists, that means we're helping them. Right now, I believe that lifting 
the trade embargo is the right way to go. I believe in opening our minds and 
thinking in a broader way." 
</P>
<P>
 In another era -- when politics in the immigrant community was played with a 
sharper edge -- such opinions failed the litmus test of anti-Communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon reached a "level of threats and political pressure that was 
higher than other places. Very noisy. Very dangerous and very complicated," 
recalled Yen Do, editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Dating back to 1984, Vietnamese exile groups were raising alarms about a 
calculated campaign to terrorize anyone who questioned activities of 
anti-Communists working to overthrow the Hanoi regime. The list of victims 
included not only liberal Vietnamese, but conservatives who tried to expose 
extortion schemes camouflaged as anti-Communist activities. People who 
expressed public support for normal relations with Vietnam were targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pragmatists maintained silence as they followed Vietnamese language 
newspapers' sober tales of shooting attacks, firebombings and obituaries of men 
such as Tap Van Pham. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham, the editor of a Vietnamese entertainment weekly, died in a 1987 
firebombing attack on his Garden Grove office after he published advertisements 
for companies that some anti-Communists considered fronts for the Hanoi 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last autumn, the president of the Vietnamese Chamber of 
Commerce in Westminster was sweating in a bulletproof vest, dodging rocks and 
walking in the company of a full-time bodyguard. For the heresy of supporting 
an end to the economic embargo, Co Pham was reviled as a "traitor" and a 
Communist sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
 But by April, the voices of protest were silent on the very day that President 
Clinton lifted the trade embargo. And the sinister rumors about a violent 
reaction didn't amount to a sputtering firecracker. The passive response seemed 
to mark a new stage in the political maturation of the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to keep in mind that here in a democracy using violence is 
counterproductive," said Diem Do, a staunch opponent of trade normalization who 
is a regular at Little Saigon demonstrations. "People become mature. If you 
want to win this game, using your voice is the best approach. Being violent in 
this society just doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Diem Do said he had noticed at one of the demonstrations outside chamber 
President Pham's medical offices that violence was losing popularity as a 
political tool. When a demonstrator threw a rock, Do said, other protesters 
quickly circled him and chastised him. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent decline in violence is part of a natural progression, according 
to Brian Jenkins, a researcher who has tracked domestic political violence for 
the RAND Corp. and Kroll Associates in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the Vietnamese move away from exile politics, and become more a part of 
the new community, it's inevitable that violence declines," he said. "It's just 
the passage of time. It was the same thing in the Cuban community in Miami. It 
took 15 to 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing these changes is the younger generation, the sons and daughters of 
Vietnamese immigrants who consider Vietnam a place to vacation instead of to 
settle. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vietnamese American university students gathered for their annual 
conference this spring at UC Irvine, they made it clear that they were ready to 
move on to political issues on the home front. The theme of their conference 
reflected their views: "The Crossroads." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most students agree that we have to do something to change our tactics to 
deal with the Communists," said Ly Phan, 24, a UC Irvine biology major and 
president of the Vietnamese Student Assn. "Perhaps, after the fighting of all 
these years, people are beginning to see that the old way of fighting is not 
working anymore, and the majority of people are starting to think of other 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 His own family is split on the issue. His father, a former prisoner, opposed 
trade normalization. Yet Phan said he notices a weariness among the former 
political prisoners who have been settling here in the last five years. They 
are looking, he said, for another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you compare the mood now and the situation six or seven years ago, the 
mood is more realistic," said Nguyen, one of six Orange County Democrats who 
vied for the right to challenge Republican Rep. Robert K. Dornan for the 46th 
Congressional District seat. "People realize one thing now. We cannot overthrow 
the regime by using guns. It is healthy, this realism. I don't talk to anyone 
who raises the issue of military (force)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was also utterly realistic about the aims of his own quixotic write-in 
campaign. From the outset, he did not expect victory. And he did not achieve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the candidates always say they will win, but I don't," said Nguyen. 
"I set my goals very modestly, because all I wanted to do is stir up the 
community. If people come out in big numbers and become more familiar with the 
political process, then I consider that a win. . . . I want to tell people that 
this is our home. If you want to go out and influence the course of Vietnam, 
then the best way to do it is our political base." 
</P>
<P>
 He and a circle of younger friends pooled $10,000 to spend on mailed flyers 
and a telephone bank to cajole Vietnamese American voters to register, seek 
absentee ballots, and even switch their loyalties to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 His advertisements urging participation in the voting process were running 
weekly in the Vietnamese language Con Co -- The Stork. And he didn't stint on 
the scut work of local politics, distributing flyers along the sidewalks of 
Little Saigon or at the Strawberry Festival in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, he found himself playing the role of teacher instead of 
politician, instructing Vietnamese American voters that it's permissible to 
shift allegiances from the Republicans to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these voters may be so busy surviving that they are oblivious to the 
Vietnamese American politicians trying to establish themselves as leaders. 
Indeed, 88% of those surveyed could not name a leader in their community. Only 
5% of the Vietnamese in Southern California could name Tony Lam, the 
Westminster city councilman thought to be the only Vietnamese American elected 
official nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a large community," said Lam, "so there's bound to be many people 
claiming to represent it. If you asked who is the first Vietnamese to be 
elected to office in the U.S., your answer would be considerably more than 5%." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Vietnamese American voters have leaned toward the Republican Party, 
many believing it takes a harsher view of Communism. 
</P>
<P>
 And the survey detects that party line; more than 62% of Vietnamese American 
voters in Southern California are registered Republicans, contrasted with 24% 
who consider themselves Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In conservative Orange County, which has the largest concentration of 
Vietnamese outside Vietnam, the Republican figure rises to 68%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ky Ngo, chairman of the Vietnamese-American Political Action Committee and a 
member of the state central committee for Republicans, said the party has been 
an easy sell because of its foreign policy. But in many ways he is delivering 
the same moderate message as Democrat Nguyen to potential Vietnamese American 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them that if we don't vote, we have no voice," said Ngo. "It's the 
only way we can help from Vietnam. It's different than 10 years ago. We're not 
going to send the military at this time. Now we should use politics and the 
economy to do the fighting. We recognize that in 1975 we lost our country -- 
not because we didn't know how to fight -- but because we lost the political 
power in Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, almost half of Vietnamese residents in Southern 
California are citizens, with 59% saying they are registered to vote. And those 
who are not citizens hunger to start the process; more than 80% say they expect 
to become citizens within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Vietnamese activists say this desire for citizenship is rooted in 
practical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Vietnamese community of Southern California started raising 
alarms on Little Saigon radio about congressional welfare reform bills that 
seek to deny Supplemental Security Income benefits to elderly immigrants until 
they become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 9,000 people streamed through the shopping strip offices of the 
group to sign petitions denouncing the proposal, and the talk shows are still 
crackling with complaints about it. Soon after, many Vietnamese immigrants 
started signing up for citizenship preparation classes. 
</P>
<P>
 This break with the past is all the more dramatic given the reverence for 
homeland in their culture, a view summed up by the Vietnamese expression: Your 
country is where your umbilical cord is buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoang Van Duc, a medical professor at USC, has tried to offer advice to two 
generations -- his children and grandchildren -- about how to choose their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a Vietnamese cultural (tradition) that you belong where you are born," 
said Duc, who is in his 70s. "For our young ones who were born here or raised 
here, the U.S. is their first country. Second is the country of Vietnam. So 
now, they have to go out and vote. As Americans they still have a fatherland, 
and if they want to improve the fatherland then they've got to work right 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Thuan Le and Lily Dizon contributed to this story. How the 
Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 861 adult Vietnamese residents of Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties by telephone 
from March 28 through April 19, 1994. The questions were developed in 
consultation with Duong Pham, a visiting lecturer at UC Irvine and UCLA, and 
Khao Luu, president of the Assn. of Former Vietnamese Educators Overseas. The 
interviewing was conducted in Vietnamese and English by Vietnamese American 
interviewers at Interviewing Services of America Inc. of Van Nuys. A list of 
Vietnamese surnames was used to draw the samples from phone directories in the 
six counties. Results were adjusted slightly so that the sample conforms with 
census information about sex, age and education. Vietnamese residents of Orange 
County were oversampled and a total of 502 interviews were conducted there; 359 
were conducted in the other five counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Southern California results are cited, the Orange County sample is 
weighted to its proper proportion in the sample. The margin of sampling error 
for the entire sample is plus or minus 4 percentage points. For the Orange 
County sample, the error is plus or minus 5 percentage points, for the rest of 
the region it is plus or minus 7 points. The sampling error for other subgroups 
may vary. In addition to sampling error, poll results can be affected by other 
factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented. Additionally, surname samples of this type do not allow for the 
sampling of people with unlisted telephone numbers and Vietnamese residents who 
do not have Vietnamese surnames. Los Angeles Times Poll: Citizenship and 
Political Process 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the Vietnamese immigrant community in Southern California has 
taken advantage of the opportunity to become U.S. citizens, and four out of 
five non-citizens expect to do so soon. By a large margin, they also think it 
is important to take part in the American political process.

COLUMN ONE; CHINA'S INVISIBLE WEAPON; LONG-SECRET CIA REPORT SHOWS HOW BEIJING 
MANIPULATED U.S. FOREIGN POLICY ELITE. STUDY REVEALS DEFT DIPLOMACY IN PLAYING 
OFF AMERICAN INSECURITY, AMBITION AND SENSE OF GUILT TO ACHIEVE GOALS.

<P>
 For years, China relied on its importance in the Cold War as its main 
bargaining tool with the United States. Now it uses its economic might. But for 
more than two decades it has had another hidden, powerful weapon in dealing 
with the U.S.: its sophistication in courting those Americans who count the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-secret, two-volume history of U.S.-China negotiations, released by the 
CIA to The Times, details how Beijing repeatedly "manipulated" top U.S. 
officials, from the Nixon through Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, written by the RAND Corp. for U.S. intelligence agencies, is laced 
with examples of how the Chinese handled the United States' foreign policy 
elite, including Henry A. Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai in 1971, the Chinese used a variety 
of tactics -- from serving opulent banquets to playing U.S. presidential 
politics -- to advance their interests on issues such as Taiwan and Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most distinctive characteristic of Chinese negotiating behavior is an 
effort to develop and manipulate strong interpersonal relationships with 
foreign officials," the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The study contains the first transcripts of top-level conversations between 
U.S. and Chinese leaders ever made public. Among them are the historic visit of 
July, 1971 -- when Kissinger, President Richard Nixon's national security 
adviser, became the first U.S. official in more than two decades to visit the 
world's most populous country -- and Nixon's own trip to China in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, scholars say, virtually all public knowledge of these events has 
come from the sometimes self-serving accounts of Nixon, Kissinger and other 
U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1985 study, which The Times obtained under a Freedom of Information Act 
lawsuit after five years of requests, paints a less heroic and less flattering 
portrait of the Americans than the accounts based on their memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, the study shows how skillfully China conducted its diplomacy with 
the United States -- a lesson demonstrated once again last month by Beijing's 
success in persuading the Clinton Administration to back away from its attempts 
to impose human rights conditions on trade privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 From the earliest days of the Nixon-Kissinger initiatives, the study says, the 
Chinese tried to exploit individual insecurities, play off Presidents against 
their domestic rivals and orchestrate meetings to maximize Americans' sense of 
"gratitude, awe and helplessness." 
</P>
<P>
 On the landmark 1972 Nixon visit, for example, Kissinger negotiated the 
"Shanghai communique" -- in which the United States acknowledged that Taiwan 
was part of China -- "late at night after a banquet of Peking duck and powerful 
mao tai liquor," the study says. In the afterglow of the sumptuous spread, 
Kissinger is quoted as telling his hosts, "After a dinner of Peking duck, I'll 
sign anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials tried, usually successfully, to carry out negotiations on 
their own turf and by their own rules. U.S. officials invariably had the 
disadvantage of having to lay out their own positions first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two sayings," Vice Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua told Kissinger in 
New York in October, 1976. "One is that when we are the host, we should let the 
guests begin. And the other is that when we are guests, we should defer to the 
host." Kissinger joked about the imbalance but volunteered, "I will be glad to 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the report says that the Chinese were masters at keeping their 
visitors on edge and off balance. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip to Beijing in May, 1978, Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's 
national security adviser, engaged in what RAND describes as "almost comical" 
exchanges with Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders as he repeatedly tried 
over two days to inform them that Carter wanted to normalize relations with 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese acted as though they did not hear Brzezinski or believe him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking forward to the day when Carter makes up his mind," Deng said. 
"Let us now shift the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Brzezinski finally burst out in frustration, "I have told you before, 
President Carter has made up his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The RAND report said the incident shows "how the Chinese can hold off (a 
visiting official) in order to entice him to accommodate to their position." 
</P>
<P>
 In his memoirs, Brzezinski recounted this conversation but minimized its 
importance, concluding that Deng had shown flexibility on Taiwan issues. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND completed the study in 1985. The author, Richard H. Solomon, a RAND 
specialist on China, had been an aide to Kissinger on the National Security 
Council and later served as a senior State Department official in the Ronald 
Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 In commissioning the study, the U.S. intelligence agencies sought insight into 
China's strategies in negotiations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese considered it crucial to establish strong personal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They attempt to identify a sympathetic counterpart official in a foreign 
government and work to cultivate a personal relationship, a sense of 
'friendship' and obligation," the study says. "They manipulate feelings of 
goodwill, obligation, guilt or dependence to achieve their negotiating 
objectives." 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows clearly that during the Nixon Administration's opening to 
China, Chou and other leaders repeatedly played upon Nixon's fear that the 
historic first steps might be made by Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Kissinger arrived in Beijing from Pakistan on his secret trip July 
9, 1971, a year and a half before Nixon's first term was to expire, the prime 
minister quietly told him: "The time that is left for President Nixon is quite 
limited." 
</P>
<P>
 "Which time period is the prime minister talking about: 5 1/2 years or 1 1/2 
years?" Kissinger asked, a reference to whether he expected Nixon to be elected 
to a second term. Chou replied that when Nixon came to China, "he will answer 
that question." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the prime minister let Kissinger know he had "a great pile of 
letters (from other U.S. politicians) on my desk, asking for invitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was so worried that his political rivals would beat him to China that 
Kissinger specifically told Chou that the President "wants no political 
visitors before his trip," the study says. And two weeks later, in secret talks 
in Paris, Kissinger also added a new request that the Chinese "keep their 
distance from American 'left' groups." 
</P>
<P>
 China complied with these requests -- in large part, the study says, because 
Chou and Chairman Mao believed "that Nixon's shift in China policy would in 
fact contribute to the President's reelection and thus they, by dealing with 
Nixon alone, would put the President in their debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger does not discuss these conversations in his memoirs, although he 
mentions that on the eve of his 1971 meeting with Chou, Nixon had asked him to 
seek from China "a severe limit on political visitors" before any presidential 
trip to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The quotes used in the study also provide voluminous new evidence of the 
earthy, sometimes crude nature of Mao, the founding leader of the People's 
Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1973, Mao wondered aloud to Kissinger why Americans were always 
"breaking wind" about the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Mao, brought up among the peasants of Hunan province, taunted 
Bush, a Yale graduate who was then head of the U.S. liaison office in Beijing: 
"You don't know my temperament. I like people to curse me. . . . If you don't 
curse me, I won't see you." 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, the transcripts illustrate Mao's philosophical side and his 
self-proclaimed role as the embodiment of China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese are very alien-excluding," Mao told visiting Americans in early 
1973. "For instance, in your country, you can let in so many nationalities, yet 
in China, how many foreigners do you see? . . . You have about 600,000 Chinese 
in the United States. We probably don't even have 60 Americans here." 
</P>
<P>
 The study also provides a wealth of fascinating new details about the 
Kissinger and Nixon trips. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, it discloses that in the days before Nixon's visit, U.S. 
officials were secretly trying to arrange what would have been an even more 
stunning coup: a meeting in Beijing between the U.S. President and Le Duc Tho, 
North Vietnam's representative to talks aimed at ending the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, the White House had heard rumors Le would visit 
Beijing just before Nixon's trip. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 6, 1972, two weeks before Nixon landed, the United States sent a 
secret message to China, through Paris, offering to meet with Le to discuss 
Indochina "with generosity and justice." 
</P>
<P>
 China refused, answering that it supported North Vietnam and would not meddle 
in the talks. The secret offer underscores how much Nixon and Kissinger had 
hoped that their overtures to China would lead directly to a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kissinger made his secret trip to China, the history shows, Chou tried 
unsuccessfully to persuade him that they should tape-record their talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they wanted to be able to tell the Vietnamese or the Koreans, 'Here's 
a tape of what we said,' " Solomon, the author of the RAND study, explained. 
"He (Chou) was trying to find a way to protect China's credibility with their 
close allies." 
</P>
<P>
 China constantly tried to pit U.S. leaders against one another or to make use 
of frictions among the Americans, Solomon's study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Gerald Ford Administration, Chinese leaders played Kissinger 
against Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1975, they invited former President Nixon to China to help bring 
pressure on Ford for normalization. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Carter era, they exploited rivalries between Brzezinski and 
Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance. When Reagan took office, they favored 
Secretary of State Alexander Haig over Richard Allen, the President's national 
security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The study says China twitted Kissinger for years with Deng's 1974 invitation 
that Schlesinger visit China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be jealous," Huang Zhen, head of China's liaison office in Washington, 
told Kissinger on Aug. 18, 1976, as Schlesinger was about to make his trip. 
"You have been to China nine times, I believe. You even said yourself you 
wanted to go to Inner Mongolia." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I didn't get there," Kissinger answered. "I wanted to see the musk ox of 
Mongolia." 
</P>
<P>
 The RAND report makes it plain that the Chinese divided U.S. officials into 
friends and enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In at least one instance, (China) actively attempted to block the appointment 
of an individual they considered to be hostile to them," the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Ray Cline, a former CIA station chief in Taiwan and a strong 
supporter of its interests, who was helping Reagan's 1980 presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bush, then Reagan's running mate, visited Beijing in August, 1980, Deng 
asked tough, leading questions about whether Cline's pro-Taiwanese views 
reflected Reagan-Bush policy, according to the report. And after Reagan's 
election, the Chinese, fearing that Cline would be appointed assistant 
secretary of state for East Asia, published attacks on his views. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline did not get the job. In general, the study concludes, the Chinese did 
not try to cultivate skeptical or hostile Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese seem to feel comfortable only in dealing with those who share a 
basic inclination to establish positive guanxi (relationships) at the human 
level," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese leaders skillfully courted U.S. leaders whom they could depict as "old 
friends" of China -- particularly Kissinger and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "The official or negotiator is put in the position of having to 'deliver' for 
the Chinese to sustain his relationship with them, or face a loss of respect, 
prestige and political influence" in Chinese eyes, concludes the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such was the game the Chinese played with Henry Kissinger in 1974-75 when 
they wanted him to complete the normalization process and, with George Bush in 
1980 and 1982, when they wanted assurances from the Reagan Administration that 
it would not 'turn back the clock' on U.S.-China policy." 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1975, when it became clear that Kissinger could not bring about 
normalization, China's dealings with him "bordered at times on the 
contemptuous, as he was in their view a 'friend' who had failed to fulfill a 
commitment," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger's two volumes of memoirs stop with Nixon's resignation and do not 
cover his years in the Ford Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The frictions of the Ford period seemed to have had some lasting effect. 
According to the study, Deng made some obliquely nasty remarks in 1981 to 
Secretary of State Haig about Kissinger, asserting: "I am very familiar with 
Dr. Kissinger. And we have great admiration for Mr. Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite China's occasional scorn, the history shows that Kissinger went to 
great lengths to preserve the close relationship he had forged with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon of Aug. 9, 1974, within hours after Nixon resigned as 
President, Kissinger assured Huang Zhen, China's de facto ambassador to the 
United States, that all informal agreements made by Nixon and the Chinese were 
reconfirmed. Kissinger then brought Huang in for a meeting with new President 
Ford, who handed the Chinese envoy a letter to Mao. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford had only been in office for a few hours. In the letter, presumably 
drafted by Kissinger's staff, he promised Mao that U.S. policy would remain 
unchanged, that Kissinger would stay on as secretary of state and that Ford 
would give top priority to "accelerating" normalization with China. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to analyzing Chinese negotiating behavior, the intelligence study 
was designed to serve as a secret history of the first 16 years of U.S.-China 
negotiations, from 1969 through 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 That was necessary because the classified records of top-level talks with 
China by the Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations were spread 
throughout various U.S. agencies and presidential libraries. The Carter and 
Reagan administrations had found that Chinese officials sometimes exaggerated 
what they had been promised by earlier administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND was working for the National Intelligence Council, the U.S. government's 
umbrella group that oversees the analytic work of the CIA and other agencies in 
the U.S. intelligence community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times first sought access to the report in a 1989 Freedom of Information 
Act request to the CIA. After four years of review and appeals, the CIA 
rejected The Times request last summer, releasing only part of the chronology 
that accompanied the study but none of the conversations or analysis in the 
study itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, The Times filed a lawsuit against the CIA in U.S. District 
Court here under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the case, the CIA in late May declassified most of the study, 
including many of the conversations and the overall analysis, and turned them 
over to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 A few parts of the study are still being withheld. U.S. officials deleted some 
information on arms sales to Taiwan on grounds that they remain "highly 
sensitive" in U.S.-China relations. And they withheld many conversations 
involving Deng, who, they observed, is "still politically active." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years in which the CIA and State Department had refused to make the 
intelligence report public, they cited the importance of maintaining secrecy 
and confidentiality in foreign policy. But some U.S. officials had suggested 
other motivations. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. Ambassador to China James R. Lilley said last year, "There was a 
lot of buttering up of the Chinese that wouldn't look too good today." 
</P>
<P>
 HENRY A. KISSINGER: "After a dinner of Peking duck, I'll agree to anything." 
Feb. 24, 1972 
</P>
<P>
 MAO TSE-TUNG: "The Chinese are very alien-excluding. . . . You have about 
600,000 Chinese in the United States. We probably don't even have 60 Americans 
here." 1973

OLD LAW GIVES MINERS THE GOLD, U.S. THE DROSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>

<P>
 The state flag fluttering above the Pine Tree Restaurant in this remote town 
near Yellowstone National Park displays Montana's promise to miners: "Oro y 
Plata" -- Spanish for "Gold and Silver." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, that promise has produced a less savory combination of 
metals. A lethal mixture of copper, lead, chromium and iron -- leaching from a 
waste heap left by an old gold mine built on federally owned land -- has turned 
once-pure Soda Butte Creek into a poisonous red ribbon that can sustain almost 
no life for three or four miles beyond Cooke City. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as miners are concerned, the flag's promise has been kept. But while 
the miners have gotten the gold and silver, many in Cooke City contend that 
their city and U.S. taxpayers have gotten the shaft. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty miles to the north, for example, the Stillwater Mine could yield a pair 
of giant corporations as much as $30 billion of platinum, palladium and silver. 
But although the land where these treasures have been found is almost entirely 
owned by the federal government, the U.S. Treasury will probably not receive so 
much as a silver dollar in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the pollution in Soda Butte Creek and the revenue stream from the 
Stillwater Mine are legacies of a federal law signed by President Ulysses S. 
Grant in 1872 and left largely intact. By promising miners the fruits of their 
prospecting, the law was intended to help settle the West and develop the 
nation's wealth. But it has left the federal government with little more than 
the pollution that the mines generate. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt kicked off the Clinton Administration's 
campaign for mining reform last year when, with a disgusted look, he publicly 
signed documents giving a Canadian-owned mining company the ownership rights to 
a parcel of federal land containing one of the world's richest veins of gold -- 
as much as $8 billion worth -- in return for a payment of only $9,000 to the 
U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many mining companies . . . are ripping off the American public fair and 
square," Babbitt told reporters at the time. "It (the 1872 law) ought to be 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The House has already approved a sweeping mining reform bill. Passed in 
November, 316 to 108, the bill exacts stiff royalties from mines on federal 
lands, uses the revenue to establish a cleanup fund for abandoned mines and 
sets strict federal environmental standards for the operation and closure of 
mines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mining industry mounted a counter-campaign that resulted in Senate 
passage of a much weaker bill. That legislation, sponsored by Sen. Larry E. 
Craig (R-Ida.), imposes much smaller royalties on miners and includes none of 
the environmental provisions of the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome will be determined by a House-Senate conference committee. 
Babbitt, who points out that the industry is now at least willing to discuss 
reform, hopes that a new era is at hand. "I'm optimistic this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cooke City and many other U.S. communities, change may well come too late. 
Under the 1872 law, about 400,000 mines have been excavated and abandoned on 
federal lands across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner said "a significant 
number" of mines leach cyanide, arsenic, cadmium and lead into nearby streams, 
lakes and ground water. About 3 million acres of federal land -- an area the 
size of Connecticut -- have been sold to private mining companies for $2.50 to 
$5 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 abandoned mining areas have been placed on the government's 
Superfund list of toxic waste sites. They include the giant Summitville Gold 
Mine in Colorado, which in 1992 spilled cyanide and acid-laced runoff into the 
Alamosa River, killing aquatic life for 17 miles downstream. The Canadian 
owner, Galactic Resources Ltd., declared bankruptcy, leaving taxpayers with a 
cleanup bill estimated at $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, U.S. taxpayers are expected to foot bills of $33 billion to $77 
billion for the cleanup of Summitville and other mines on federal lands, 
according to estimates by the Mineral Policy Center, a Washington-based mining 
industry watchdog and a key player in the latest bid for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, mining companies -- many of them foreign-owned -- are scooping up 
$1.2 billion worth of minerals from federal lands annually, according to the 
General Accounting Office. They paid "not one thin dime" in royalties to 
American taxpayers, according to Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), an advocate of 
reforming the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1872 law heaps fiscal injury upon environmental insult," said Philip 
Hocker, director of the Mineral Policy Center. "It has got to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The public seems to agree. A 1990 poll conducted for the American Mining 
Congress, the industry's principal professional association, found that eight 
in 10 respondents said they believe the mining industry "should have to restore 
federal land and pay royalties to the government just like the oil and coal 
industries do." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a response, said an internal American Mining Congress strategy document, 
"provides the most concrete evidence that the industry should not conduct the 
mining law battle in public view." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, however, the mining industry has gone on the offensive to 
counter perceptions that it wants to block reform. "We are willing to pay our 
fair share, and we've been at the table ready to resolve this debate," the 
presidents of four major mining companies wrote last month in the Denver Post. 
"We support change. However, we hope that change doesn't kill the gold mining 
industry in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 But within days of signing that letter, the president of Echo Bay Mines was 
taking Babbitt to court in an effort to win ownership rights to 660 acres of 
federal land -- at a cost of $3,305 -- under the terms of the 1872 law. An 
angry Babbitt called the lawsuit "a blatant attempt to exempt themselves from 
the environmental and regulatory provisions that will come out of mining 
reform" by "those who claim they want reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The mining industry has much to lose. The 1872 law established mining as "the 
highest use" for federal lands, a status that has given Interior little 
latitude to deny applications for rights to mine the nation's landholdings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury receives revenues from the payrolls and profits that mining 
companies make from their U.S. operations, but nothing more. Oil companies pay 
the government a direct royalty of 12.5% of the value of the goods they extract 
from federal land, and coal mining companies pay 8%. But under the 1872 law, 
hard-rock mining companies, whether foreign- or American-owned, pay no direct 
royalties for the use of the federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get indignant," said Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), one of the authors 
of the House bill. "These companies think they have a God-given right to have 
the taxpayers support them." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller argued that the political and economic weight of the American West has 
shifted away from extraction industries such as mining, giving land-reform 
efforts a powerful impetus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West is filling up with people, and these people want to use the lands, 
the streams, the open spaces," Miller said. "But because of industries like 
mining, the streams are polluted, the ground water is contaminated, the air is 
dirty. You used to be able to get away with that when no one was out there. But 
you can't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The House-passed bill abolishes the sale of federal land to private mining 
firms, a practice that mining firms call crucial to ensuring that they have the 
rights to mine land on which they have made substantial investments. And in one 
of its most controversial provisions, it imposes a royalty of 8% of the gross 
value of hard-rock minerals taken from federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill could also make places such as the area around Cooke City harder to 
mine by giving the Interior secretary the right to declare some federal lands 
unsuitable for mining. Less than three miles north of Yellowstone National 
Park, Cooke City is the proposed site of a mine that promises to yield $600 
million in gold and copper. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant pond that would hold the mine's poisonous waste would be built in a 
prime area traveled by the endangered grizzly bear. If water seeps from the 
mine, or if the impoundment pond leaks or overflows, critics say they fear that 
the operation could contaminate waters that flow into Yellowstone Park or into 
Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, a waterway so spectacular that it has won 
federal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Mining companies argue that the House bill could cost as many as 44,000 jobs 
in 14 states. They also maintain that it could reduce income to the Treasury by 
$422 million a year by cutting the mining industry's earnings and output.

 Craig argued that setting royalties any higher would make it unprofitable for 
mining companies to operate in the United States. In response, the mining 
industry would take its high technology and its high-wage, blue-collar jobs and 
pack off to Africa, East Asia, Latin America and the republics of the former 
Soviet Union, where environmental regulations and the cost of operations are 
more forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge incenses Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mining industry has been threatening to go abroad since 1880," he said. 
"There is more mining going on, more profits, more productivity now in this 
country than there were 100 years ago. . . . It's a rhetorical threat." 
</P>
<P>
 With lawmakers set to begin negotiations on reconciling the House and Senate 
bills, Babbitt said he would be "packing my proverbial suitcase, heading out to 
every crossroads in the West, selling my wares."

COUNSELORS: HIGH SCHOOLS' UNSUNG HEROES; EDUCATION: THOSE WHO GUIDE STUDENTS 
TOWARD COLLEGE PLAY ROLES OF ADVISER, ACCOUNTANT, MORALE BOOSTER.

 North Hollywood High School college counselor Susan Bonoff tracked down two of 
her former pupils from 18 years ago to help pay for a needy student to attend 
Stanford University this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester High college counselor Esther Hugo, who routinely takes students' 
financial aid applications to the post office, usually pays the postage, too. 
</P>
<P>
 And Birmingham High counselor Jan Livingston is helping a senior -- who 
graduates this week -- hastily apply to colleges for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 28,000 members of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Class of 
1994 accept their diplomas this week, it is their college counselors who will 
be remembering the anguish and joy of the last few months. More than half of 
the seniors experienced the grueling process of applying to college, the 
emotional roller coaster of acceptance and rejection and, finally, the tough 
financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's 49 college counselors shared in most of the turmoil. Each is 
part academic adviser, accountant, real estate agent, morale booster and 
immigration expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is college counseling is alive and well . . . but the job is truly 
overwhelming," said Livingston, who works at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. "You 
anguish with the kids. You want them to succeed. I see them at graduation and I 
know they'll go on without me and I'll never know the results." 
</P>
<P>
 While the college counselors say they advise hundreds of students in their 
junior and senior years, they do get help from other counselors who help gear 
students toward college. The district has just one college counselor on every 
high school campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The counselors -- considered the unsung heroes of graduation -- say they will 
do whatever they can for their college-bound students. Even if it means calling 
people for money, cajoling favors from admissions officers or convincing 
parents that dorm life isn't all that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 They are nothing if not persistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "College counselors are just tenacious people," said Chuck Espalin, director 
of the district's counseling program. "They're changing the lives of these 
students and it's a very tough job but a very satisfying one." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jesus Torres, Stanford University would be just a dream without Susan 
Bonoff. Through tireless phone calls and networking, Bonoff managed to find 
enough money to help Jesus meet Stanford's $28,000 tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with financial aid and help from Stanford, Jesus was left to pay $13,000 
for his first year. He says his parents, who earn less than $40,000 a year, 
will contribute several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonoff found Jesus a summer job in Silicon Valley, where he will make about 
$2,000, and he will take out a $3,000 loan. In the end, he was left $4,000 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really worried," Jesus recently as he scanned a scholarship brochure 
for Latino students. "I basically didn't want my family in any financial 
danger. I didn't think I could go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonoff remembered seeing the names of two of her former junior high school 
English students on the letterhead of a scholarship bulletin. She tracked down 
one of the students and nervously explained the financial dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Bonoff and Jesus met the two businessmen for lunch, and the money 
will be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I call you up 10 years from now when you're a successful engineer and I 
tell you I have a student who can't afford college, will you help me?" Bonoff 
asked Jesus recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely -- without question," he said quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationships between these counselors and their students begin early. 
Typically, counselors start addressing students when they are sophomores. But 
it's the junior year when the push begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The counselors guide students in choosing college-preparatory courses and keep 
after them to maintain their grade-point averages. Most hold college awareness 
nights for parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, they become aggressive advocates for the students -- writing letters of 
recommendation, calling admissions offices to put in a good word, grilling 
financial aid officers about denied applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The counselors also have the tough job of advising students who are not U.S. 
citizens. The University of California and community college systems require 
these students to pay higher fees and tuition. Many counselors say they discuss 
the process of becoming legal citizens with students frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 The counselors also work increasingly with parents who are either reluctant to 
send their children to college because they never went or who never thought it 
was a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, the counselors say, it is the parents who must be swayed and not 
the students. "Sometimes I tell the students, 'Let's get the application in and 
we'll deal with your mother later,' " said Steve Kleinberg, the college 
counselor at Monroe High in North Hills. "Part of it is definitely encouraging 
parents about the importance of education." 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, it is pure hand-holding. "A mother called me the other day 
laughing and crying," said Cassandra Roy, the counselor at Crenshaw High School 
in South-Central Los Angeles, which sends nearly 80% of its seniors to college. 
The woman was "laughing because she was happy her son was going to college in 
Ohio, but crying because he's the oldest child and the first to leave," said 
Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors also find themselves acting as motivational speakers for students 
who underestimate themselves and aim at "safe" schools. It is then that the 
counselors also become public relations consultants for other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really their first year of college -- not next year, when they are 
freshmen," said Crenshaw's Roy. "This is when they learn how to jump through 
the hoops." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district, the largest in the state, sent about 65% of its 24,172 
graduates last year to a two-year or a four-year college. The district has not 
yet compiled statistics for the Class of 1994, but officials say they expect to 
see similar numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nearly 28,000 seniors this year, more than 57% are Latino, 14% are 
black, 16.6% are white and nearly 9% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 With an increasing number of students needing financial assistance at a time 
when federal and state aid is decreasing, counselors say they must be more 
creative in finding scholarships and loans. Some students and parents, however, 
are reluctant to borrow money and the counselors say they are becoming 
financial-planning experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the fall, all we hear is, 'Get me into college,' " said Bonoff. "Now all I 
hear is, 'Help me pay for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester High is one of the few schools in the district with an academic 
booster club of sorts, where parents raise money for the college office. This 
year, Westchester students will receive about $20,000 in scholarships -- all 
raised by the parents' group. 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters spend days on Los Angeles Unified campuses, often making 
return visits to meet students and encourage them to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools, such as Monroe, have college outreach advisers who help students 
complete registration forms and financial applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's Roy said that campus had an unusual problem after the 1992 riots, 
when the number of recruiters dropped significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they were scared to come," Roy said, adding that recruitment has 
picked up recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbia University recruiter at North Hollywood got an earful last fall 
from Bonoff, who arranged a meeting and ultimately got a free trip to New York 
for one senior. Roberto Diaz, who will be paying $1,500 to attend the 
$29,000-a-year school, said Bonoff gave him the push to apply to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right off the bat, Mrs. Bonoff said I should go to Columbia," Roberto said 
recently. "She really pulled for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto, who said his parents earn about $23,000 a year as a parking attendant 
and seamstress, was worried about attending such a high-end campus. "But it all 
came together for me," he said. "I thought New York City would be the greatest, 
but I didn't know if I could actually go." 
</P>
<P>
 For Birmingham's Livingston, the past two weeks have been trying. A student 
who hadn't thought about going to college decided at the last minute to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that every student is college material, and the trick is you just 
have to figure out which college," she said. "We just keep doing it because we 
really care about these kids." Higher Learning 
</P>
<P>
 The following list shows the 49 high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and the percentage of seniors who entered the University of California 
or the California State University systems. The rates are for the Class of 
1991, the last year for which the district had statistics available. The 
district does not keep data on the numbers of seniors who attend two-year 
colleges. While officials estimate that about 65% of the Class of 1994 will 
enter either two- or four-year colleges this fall, they do not have 
school-by-school breakdowns available. San Fernando Valley schools are in bold

TORRES CARRIES LATINO HOPES FOR STATE POST; POLITICS: MANY VIEW HIS PRIMARY WIN 
IN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RACE AS A SIGN OF THE EMERGING CLOUT AND 
CROSS-OVER APPEAL OF LATINO ELECTED OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After Romualdo Pacheco stepped down as California's 12th governor in 1876, a 
more than century-long dry spell began for Latino politicians. But now, in his 
quest to become insurance commissioner, state Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles 
could become the first Latino to hold statewide office since the bearded, 
aristocratic Pacheco. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' victory in last week's Democratic primary has sparked a sense of pride 
and hope for many in the Latino community who view his candidacy as a symbol of 
the emerging political clout and cross-over appeal of Latino elected officials. 
For many, a Torres victory in the November general election would send an 
overdue message that state government is becoming representative of 
California's changing demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will serve as the role model for all Latinos," said Assemblyman Joe Baca 
(D-San Bernardino), who was elected in 1992 when Latinos increased their 
numbers in the Legislature from seven to 11 members. "He is our Moses who will 
take the people to the valley -- and the valley will be equity and 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Torres' candidacy is also a tale of perseverance and resiliency. 
His longtime friends say his victory in the primary speaks volumes about Art 
Torres the man -- a person who has overcome drinking problems, a divorce and a 
bitter loss three years ago to a powerful rival for a seat on the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen him during the good times and the bad times, but I would have to 
say this is probably the greatest victory he's ever had," said Los Angeles City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torres' road to one of the state's most powerful elected posts is far from 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons that no Latino has held statewide office in more than a century 
are rooted in a complex mix of demographic, political and social factors. 
Between 1850 and 1880, more than half of the elected officials in Southern 
California -- including Pacheco -- were Mexican Americans connected to a landed 
aristocracy that dominated area politics, said Fernando Guerra, a political 
scientist and historian at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had economic power, political experience and concentrated numbers in 
certain regions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the influence of those Californios waned as increasing numbers of whites 
moved to the state, Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other reasons: Latinos have been divided along class lines; racism 
and exclusion have hindered Latino political development, and the influx of 
other groups has diluted Latino voting power. 
</P>
<P>
 And only now are Latinos poised to ascend to statewide office as demographics 
change once again, as education and economic levels increase and as more 
Latinos participate in the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres was first elected to the Assembly in 1974 and then to the state Senate 
in 1982. His 24th Senate District takes in the heavily Latino East Los Angeles 
area. Throughout his campaign for statewide office, Torres has said that he is 
not a Latino candidate, but a candidate who happens to be Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the historical significance of the race is not lost on the politician 
who grew up on Los Angeles' Eastside and who earned his stripes as a young 
attorney working on behalf of migrant farm workers in the late 1960s and early 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a tremendous sense of duty to not let down my community, and I'm not 
going to," said Torres, 47, who has developed into one of the most eloquent 
orators in Sacramento. "But I also have shown that I have been willing to work 
on behalf of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, chairman of the Senate Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee, 
has vowed to be a watchdog for consumers and stand up to the insurance 
industry. His legislative accomplishments include a 1979 Medi-Cal reform bill 
that allows senior citizens to receive care at home and a 1985 measure he says 
has prevented thousands of children from dropping out of school. He also was a 
co-author of the bill banning the sale of assault weapons in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In capturing 46% of the primary vote, he survived attacks from his main 
challenger, Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), whose radio ads 
questioned whether someone with two drunk-driving convictions should become 
insurance commissioner. Torres maintains that the convictions are not an issue 
and says his successful recovery from alcoholism is a testament to his 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a testimony that I can come back and show that life doesn't 
end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His Republican opponent, Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush of San Jose, said 
he plans to avoid personal attacks. "I don't think you can win that way," said 
Quackenbush, adding that he plans to focus on issues such as the high cost of 
obtaining insurance and luring companies back into the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will become the state's second elected insurance commissioner. The 
first, Democrat John Garamendi, lost in last week's gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is attracting some national attention. Torres campaign officials say 
Latino politicians outside the state have expressed an interest in raising 
funds for his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Los Angeles' Eastside -- where Latino politics have long been bitter and 
divisive -- many are calling for the community to rally around Torres' 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope that people can put aside their personalities and political 
ideologies to seize on this golden opportunity for the sake of the community," 
said Alatorre, Torres' longtime ally. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, the focus should be on getting him elected," said Eastside 
community leader Frank Villalobos, who has worked on the campaigns of Torres' 
rival -- Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina beat Torres in the 1991 supervisorial race and endorsed Margolin in the 
primary. She declined to be interviewed but said through a spokesman that she 
plans to endorse Torres and campaign on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina also issued a written statement saying: "When a Latino is elected to 
statewide office, we (will) finally see state government begin to be 
representative of the diversity of our population. It is a need long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres is mindful of the experience of Hank Lopez, the last Latino to seek 
statewide office in a general election. Lopez, the Democratic nominee for 
secretary of state in 1958, was the only major candidate to lose that year in 
what was otherwise a Democratic sweep of the state's top offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very interesting referendum as to us as a community," 
Torres said. "I think we passed the first test in the Democratic primary." 
</P>
<P>
 No local polling has been done to determine whether white voters are less 
likely to support a Latino seeking statewide office, said John Brennan, 
director of the Times Poll. However, he said, Torres obviously picked up a 
significant number of non-Latino votes in the primary because whites made up 
77% of the Democratic electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the outcome, Torres has shown that a Latino can be a viable 
statewide candidate, political observers say. And his candidacy augurs well for 
future breakthroughs by Latino candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having just one Latino there shows that government is open to the 
possibilities for Latino representation," Guerra said. "I think the candidacy 
portends that this is the beginning of more statewide efforts by Latino 
candidates."

TABLES TURN FOR BITTER RIVALS IN SAN DIEGO DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What a difference a decade makes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr. was in headlong prosecutorial 
pursuit of Mayor Roger Hedgecock, a battle that raged daily in the courts and 
the media. Miller emerged triumphant and Hedgecock was ousted from office, 
protesting that he was the victim of a vendetta by his political enemies, 
Miller and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted of conspiracy and perjury for the methods he had used to win the 
mayor's office in 1983, Hedgecock was forced from office by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 His top political strategist, a former Del Mar mayor named Tom Shepard, 
reluctantly pleaded guilty to conspiring to break various laws on contribution 
limits and financial disclosure during the 1983 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Although spared jail, Shepard left California and entered a self-imposed 
period of exile as a political untouchable. Other Hedgecock insiders from the 
ill-fated campaign were similarly sullied. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward to last Tuesday. The scandal-ridden days of 1984 are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who were facing very, very tough times back then and had a number 
of persecutors -- among them, Mr. Miller -- are now having the last laugh," 
said Michael McDade, Hedgecock's chief of staff during his abortive tenure as 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller -- the dean of county prosecutors in California -- suffered a 
humiliating primary defeat, placing fourth in a five-candidate race, barely 
nosing out a perennial candidate who has been slammed as a slumlord and 
wife-beater. 
</P>
<P>
 As Miller's political problems increased in recent months, particularly with a 
critical grand jury report and two failed and controversial prosecutions in 
child molestation cases, Miller's foes found a ready platform for their views 
on Hedgecock's radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 68, will soon be out of office but Hedgecock remains as the city's top 
radio talk-show host and a political force to be reckoned with. His daily 
three-hour program dishes up a conservative brew of political analysis and 
invective. 
</P>
<P>
 Woe to the local pol who dares to avoid the Hedgecock show or takes political 
positions contrary to those of the host. When Miller declined on election eve 
to come on the show, Hedgecock blasted him on air as a coward and attempted to 
taunt him into leaving his high-rise office and joining the other candidates in 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hedgecock has emerged from disgrace, so too has Shepard, who has 
re-established himself as the city's top campaign consultant and counts among 
his clients Mayor Susan Golding. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's election for sheriff, Shepard's latest client, former San Diego 
Police Chief Bill Kolender, demolished first-term Sheriff Jim Roache. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of the race, Roache complained bitterly that Shepard was again 
violating the law by running a deficit campaign. The charge was denied and the 
local press showed little interest in comparisons between Kolender 1994 and 
Hedgecock 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 With Miller defeated, two candidates will engage in a November runoff for 
district attorney: Municipal Judge Larry Stirling, and former Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Paul Pfingst. The Pfingst campaign is well populated with former 
Hedgecock operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The two political consultants who guided Pfingst's primary battle were 
insiders in Hedgecock's 1983 campaign. Pfingst's pollster was named by the 
grand jury as an unindicted co-conspirator of Hedgecock and Shepard. Pfingst's 
media coordinator is the former producer of Hedgecock's radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfingst joined the San Diego district attorney's office in the fall of 1984 
shortly before Hedgecock and Shepard were indicted, but he had no part in the 
case. He has not made political corruption one of his campaign issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is cheered by the return to prominence of Hedgecock et al. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad commentary on San Diego politics that people are so unconcerned 
with political ethics that they would allow this crew to have the control they 
have," said San Diego political consultant Ann Shanahan-Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The return is not seen as particularly surprising in San Diego, where politics 
is a sport played by a few dozen aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever said the Hedgecock people lacked political talent," said Peter 
Kaye, retired associate editor of the San Diego Union-Tribune. "Where they were 
short was on the ethical side." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Hedgecock happy at Tuesday's turn of events that had his old foe 
vanquished and so many of his friends victorious? Does a politician count votes 
on election night? 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't stop grinning," said Jim Valentine, current producer of 
Hedgecock's show on KSDO radio. "He's come full circle." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, the 48-year-old Hedgecock explained that it was a sense of 
rectitude that kept him and his onetime associates going. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us who were involved in those years knew we weren't guilty of what we 
were charged with," Hedgecock said. "Since we knew that, with a clear heart, 
we've gone forward in life. We didn't run away and hide. We knew we were right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't fight a system that was manipulated by people as powerful as we 
were up against. So we took our loss, we licked our wounds and we came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedgecock was convicted in 1985 of having lied about his personal and 
political finances and his links to J. David Dominelli and Nancy Hoover, La 
Jolla stockbrokers later sent to prison for running a $120-million Ponzi 
scheme. Hedgecock appealed on numerous grounds, among them that a bailiff 
improperly influenced the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the state Supreme Court overturned the 12 perjury convictions because 
of a disputed jury instruction by the judge. The court also ruled that the 
judge should have held a hearing on Hedgecock's claims about the bailiff rather 
than rely on sworn affidavits from jurors that nothing improper had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than face such a hearing and a possible retrial, Hedgecock promised to 
drop all further appeals on his conspiracy conviction that was at the heart of 
the case: that he had lied and cheated in an effort to become mayor. He paid a 
$5,000 fine and, by prior arrangement, the charge was later reduced to a 
misdemeanor and then erased from his record. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1990 he was already a radio star. From his "independent perch" on the radio 
(and a lesser one as a commentator on a San Diego television station), 
Hedgecock plays no favorites and takes few prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 In one short burst last week, he called the San Diego city manager a liar (the 
manager had opposed Hedgecock's plan for a large-scale card room), the mayor a 
do-nothing (she opposed his idea for a new airport) and the Union-Tribune 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
 He also put in a plug for the "normal people" protest contingent he is 
organizing for the upcoming Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade. He is often at odds 
with gay activists, who have accused him of gay-baiting, and with immigrant 
rights advocates, who accuse him of immigrant-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 He bills himself as the foe of political correctness and regimented thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 One theme is constant: that he only accepted the conspiracy conviction to 
avoid a third trial and that he never did anything illegal. After Miller's 
defeat, he provided his audience with a 20-minute explication of the case and 
its similarity to other celebrated cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire a lot about him," Hedgecock said of Miller, "but when it came to 
this kind of political stuff, he was as corrupt as anyone who has ever done 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for just the right turn of phrase to describe Miller, Hedgecock 
decided on "a lying crock." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, in turn, treats Hedgecock like something caught on the bottom of his 
shoe that he can't shake but doesn't want to acknowledge. Others in his camp 
are not so restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waiting for Roger Hedgecock to tell the truth is like leaving the porch light 
on for Jimmy Hoffa," said Miller's longtime spokesman Steven J. Casey. "It's 
too bad San Diego is treated to three hours of waiting for Jimmy Hoffa every 
day."

GROWERS CAN'T RESIST LURE OF THE LAND; AGRICULTURE: THE OWNERS OF A SMALL FARM 
IN VENTURA COUNTY SPECIALIZE IN GOURMET GREENS AND OTHER UNUSUAL PRODUCE. THEY 
PERSIST DESPITE GROWING COMPETITION FROM MAJOR CONGLOMERATES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 He has a master's in business from Harvard, a bachelor's in economics from 
Stanford and some blunt advice for the farmers at Underwood Ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquidate. 
</P>
<P>
 If the partners auctioned off their tractors and sold their land, they would 
no doubt reap a hefty sum. Enough, surely, to invest in a solid mutual fund, 
kick back and watch the dividends roll in. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's how consultant Bill Knoke figures it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired to draft a long-term strategy for Underwood Ranches, Knoke discovered 
that the most sensible course might be the most radical. Only half jokingly, he 
recommended that the farmers abandon farming. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in agriculture do it for the love of agriculture and not to make 
money, and that's a problem," Knoke said. "They'd be better off liquidating 
everything. They could invest the money and earn 10% (interest) without even 
working for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Solid economic students themselves, the three partners who dominate Underwood 
Ranches understand their consultant's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 But follow it? 
</P>
<P>
 No way. Not now. 
</P>
<P>
 Not now, when the first, optimistic shoots of corn have begun to stretch their 
ladyfinger leaves on the rich dirt known as Conejo Ranch. Not now, when they 
see promising new products in the pipeline, crops never before sold in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not now. But the idea lingers, tempting. 
</P>
<P>
 As spring sags into summer, the trio worries about markets and weather and 
pests. "There's always a fear of becoming another statistic," Craig Underwood 
says, to knowing nods. "When prices are down, you wonder if they'll ever turn 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 That fear has grown especially sharp because of the ferocious competition 
roaring through the produce industry. Agribusiness conglomerates are eyeing 
lucrative "niche" crops such as baby carrots and esoteric salad greens that 
were once the exclusive province of smaller farmers. And on their 60-acre patch 
outside Camarillo, the Underwood partners feel the threat. Their specialties, 
such as the gourmet greens that flourished on Conejo Ranch last season, no 
longer seem quite so special. Their sure things are undeniably unsure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the farmers are not yet ready to give up. They sank nearly $575,000 into 
Conejo Ranch last spring, buying the field with borrowed money and borrowing 
more to prepare it for farming. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only piece of property that the trio holds title to. They work other 
fields in Ventura County -- have for years -- but those plots are rented from 
absentee landlords. Conejo Ranch is theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs to farm -- and theirs to gamble on. 
</P>
<P>
 In buying the field for vegetables, the partners bucked a nationwide trend. 
Strip malls and golf courses are gobbling up huge swaths of agricultural soil. 
Nearly 2 million acres of United States farmland vanish each year, paved under 
to make way for homes and shops and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 As little guys in the produce industry, the Underwood partners understand the 
pressures that prompt farmers to divest. Yet, tugged toward the land, they find 
agriculture all but irresistible. "When it's good," partner Jim Roberts says, 
"it's really sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, it's been just shy of sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranchers have plucked a first crop of salad greens from Conejo Ranch. They 
sold about three-quarters of the harvest, at moderate prices, and mashed the 
rest into the soil to decompose -- a colorful, all-organic fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The greens, turnips and radishes proved "an average crop," Roberts said. "I 
was pleased because we didn't have a lot of weeds." On the other hand, he 
added, "We didn't break any records for making money." 
</P>
<P>
 He's hoping for better from the field's second crop: corn. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, corn ranks below even obscure crops such as kale and 
cilantro, accounting for just 1% of the annual vegetable sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But Underwood Ranches partners are banking big on their Somis Creek brand -- 
sold pre-cut, husked, and ready-to-microwave. Pegged as a "value-added" product 
because it's semi-prepared, the corn should command higher prices than the 
standard, husk-it-yourself variety. 
</P>
<P>
 From bagged gourmet salads to peeled baby carrots, the farmers at Underwood 
Ranches have focused on value-added vegetables. The problem is, so have their 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 70% of the new produce items introduced in American supermarkets over 
the past two years have been semi-processed fruits and vegetables, from sliced 
pineapple to pre-cracked coconuts. That's apparently not enough to satisfy the 
demand -- one study found 43% of shoppers clamoring for more convenient, 
easy-to-prepare produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Those kind of figures have agribusiness executives everywhere salivating. And 
when the big guys salivate, the little guys sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 With their limited resources -- several hundred employees and sales of less 
than $10 million a year -- the Underwood partners cannot begin to compete with 
the produce giants steadily moving into the prepared-veggie market. 
</P>
<P>
 One competitor, Irwindale-based Ready Pac, boasts the world's largest 
vegetable processing plant along with a thousand employees and $130 million in 
annual sales. Their crinkly bags of pre-packed salads dominate many a produce 
aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we put on the shelf sells," said Chris Nelson, Ready Pac's chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 His firm has the technology to keep cruising: "We have $2-million 
(conveyor-belt) washing lines," Nelson said, while small farmers "are using 
Kenmore washing machines." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Underwood partners actually started out drying their lettuce in 
Speed Queen laundry machines. 
</P>
<P>
 They also experimented with a low-cost, low-tech method of peeling baby 
carrots: churning them in a cement mixer with a few handfuls of railroad 
gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked real well," Underwood recalled, "but the carrots were kind of 
gritty." 
</P>
<P>
 Gritty, and metallic. Traces of iron from the railroad gravel stuck to the 
carrots. The veggies didn't taste of iron, but they did set off magnets on the 
packinghouse assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't objectionable, it wasn't like there were metal shavings in the 
carrots, but we couldn't keep on doing it," Underwood said. So he developed a 
new approach -- a massive sorting and scraping machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfecting the production and packaging of baby carrots took nearly three 
years. Developing the salad mixture, and the corn now growing on Conejo Ranch, 
each took three years as well. 
</P>
<P>
 After so much research, the partners feel confident that they have a winning 
corn product. But they're equally sure that competitors will soon be hot on 
their trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so easy in this business for people to copy what you're doing," 
Underwood said. "We may spend three years developing a product and once it's on 
the market, within six months someone else can copy it." 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the competition, the partners rely on innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 They know they will have just two to three years with each product before the 
competition gets punishingly hot. So they routinely set aside 25% of their 
profits for research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for us, as with all guerrilla operations, is to fight around the 
edges and be quick and nimble," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, they wind up with spectacular failures, as in the case of the 
poisoned potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to develop a super-sweet variety of new potato, the partners planted a 
four-acre test crop back in 1992. They expected the potatoes to turn out tender 
and fresh, tasting of spring itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Underwood recalled, "We had a little glitch." 
</P>
<P>
 When the first harvest came in, Sales Director Minos Athanassiadis zapped a 
plateful of the potatoes in the office microwave and dug into a tasty lunch. 
Ten minutes later, his chest began to tighten and his breathing grew labored. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, he managed to stay calm. Within 20 minutes, he recovered completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he wasn't too keen on that particular variety of potato. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit, it turned out, was a type of alkaloid -- an organic substance 
that also shows up, in various mutations, in caffeine, morphine and quinine. 
The colorless, crystalline substance can poison animals or humans. And it 
overpowered the other compounds in the tiny test potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chucking all four acres of the alkaloid-rich potatoes, they wrote off their 
$6,000 investment and started anew with a different variety. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio harvested a second crop this spring -- and sent the baby potatoes to 
a lab for chemical analysis before anyone tried them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pronounced fit to eat, the potatoes are now being test-marketed at several 
grocery stores. Meanwhile, the partners are perfecting yet another new product: 
salad-ready bags of Easter Egg radishes in white, red, pink and purple hues. On 
their experimental fields, they're sorting through potential moneymakers from 
peanuts to birdseed. 
</P>
<P>
 To help them plot the next moves, Craig Underwood and his partners recently 
spent several thousand dollars to hire two strategists. 
</P>
<P>
 They're asking the consultants questions such as: How much capital do they 
need? How can they speed up research and development? How can they encourage 
customer loyalty? 
</P>
<P>
 And, most basically: How can they thrive in a tumultuous industry? 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting action plans may help position the company for the future. But 
they mean little in the day-to-day grind of this hectic spring season. 
</P>
<P>
 As planting foreman Natividad Zavala said, "The only things we have are the 
weather, the earth and the hours we put in. That's how we make our living." * 
ABOUT THIS SERIES 
</P>
<P>
 "60 Acres of Hope," a series that began in October, follows the first year of 
a Southern California farm. Three previous articles traced the field's first 
crop of gourmet salad greens from planting to harvest to market. This story 
looks in part at the field's second crop -- corn -- and explores the farmers' 
attempts to develop new products to compete in a crowded industry. Future 
stories will focus on a continuing battle with the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and will evaluate the economics of the field's first year.

CHINA SIGNALS IT MAY NOT VETO U.N. CURBS ON N. KOREA; ASIA: BEIJING WANTS TO 
PLAY 'POSITIVE ROLE' IN NUCLEAR DISPUTE, JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD. 
</P>

 Signaling that it might not veto proposed U.N. sanctions against North Korea, 
China said Sunday that it intends to play a "positive role" in the U.N. debate 
over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear weapons program, a Japanese spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting here Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his 
Japanese counterpart, Koji Kakizawa, that "China is very much concerned about 
the present situation," a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "China will participate positively in the discussions in the U.N. and is ready 
to play its own positive role," Qian reportedly added. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not comment specifically on how China would respond to a sanctions 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japanese reporters interpreted Qian's statements as a hardening of China's 
attitude toward North Korea, a longtime Communist ally whose relationship with 
Beijing was once so close that the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung compared it 
to "lips and teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the five U.N. Security Council members with veto power, China opposes 
proposals sponsored by the United States to apply sanctions against North 
Korea, claiming that they would be "ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is hoping that China will not exercise its veto to 
block the proposed sanctions, which could come to a vote this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have indicated that they will seek gradual, phased-in 
sanctions against North Korea, which has continued to defy international 
demands for inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for incremental sanctions, expected to be unveiled this week, might 
begin with stopping scientific and cultural exchanges and halting U.N. 
technical assistance. Stiffer economic sanctions might follow if the milder 
measures proved ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci insisted that the 
rough plan is not a sign of White House backpedaling on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy is the same as it has been over the last year," Gallucci said 
Sunday on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." "Over the last year, the 
Administration has been committed to the objective of getting North Korea to 
forsake its nuclear weapons program . . . and to make sure that program doesn't 
end up destabilizing a whole global non-proliferation regime." 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the phased strategy, he said, is to "get the North Koreans to agree 
that it's in their interest to avoid other outcomes which they may find 
uncomfortable or more painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci stressed that the Administration has not backed down from its belief 
that it is unacceptable for North Korea to develop a nuclear weapons program. 
And he said the Administration has not ruled out the possibility of military 
action if the North Koreans do not respond to economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said President Clinton has not given final approval for the proposed 
sanctions policy and that a final draft would have to be discussed with the 
United Nations and key allies, including Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading Republican senator criticized the proposed strategy, arguing that it 
is a form of appeasement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree (that there would be) terrible consequences (from) a conflict on the 
Korean peninsula," Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said on the ABC program. "(But) I 
would suggest that we should also think about the consequences of a delay and 
doing nothing until the point where North Korea is a nuclear power. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I would suggest the attempt to impose sanctions, and strict sanctions, 
first," McCain added. "If that's not effective . . . then, yes, military air 
strikes would be called for." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting between Qian and Kakizawa on Sunday followed a series of 
consultations in China about the North Korea dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo visited China to try to 
dissuade Beijing from vetoing any sanctions resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chinese officials have 
kept in close contact with the North Koreans on several official and unofficial 
fronts as the debate over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear weapons program has 
mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States says North Korea may already have one or two nuclear 
devices. North Korea has insisted that it has no nuclear weapons program and 
has repeatedly said it would view sanctions as an act of war. 
</P>

JAPAN'S ROYAL COUPLE VISITS GALLERY IN WASHINGTON, AVOIDS POLITICS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unfailingly polite and low-key, Emperor Akihito of Japan concentrated on 
matters artistic Sunday and studiously ignored attempts to draw him into 
controversies over his country's military history. 
</P>
<P>
 While Akihito and Empress Michiko viewed works at a gallery that houses one of 
the world's finest collections of Asian art, a few hundred demonstrators 
gathered across from the White House to demand that Japan apologize for its 
actions during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators, most of them Chinese Americans, chanted, sang and waved 
signs that read "Protest Against Whitewash of History," "Japan Must Compensate 
War Victims" and "Japan Apologize for Pearl Harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the organizers, Betty Lu of Norfolk, Va., said she was concerned by 
President Clinton's approval of giving Japan a vote on the U.N. Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not admit their crimes from World War II," she said. "They might do 
it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Akihito has expressed "regret" over the war between the United States and 
Japan but has never apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Park Service police kept an eye on the noisy but peaceful protest as 
traffic in front of the White House slowed to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 A mix of Japanese and U.S. museum officials greeted the royal couple as they 
arrived at the Freer Gallery of Art, where a group of tourists applauded them. 
Inside, their principal stop was a conservation studio where work is being done 
to restore centuries-old Japanese paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program begun three years ago with funding from a Japanese foundation, 
13 Japanese paintings dating from the 12th to the 19th centuries were sent to 
Japan for restoration. Twenty-one others will also be sent. 
</P>
<P>
 Akihito will be welcomed at the White House today with full military honors.

AMERICAN ALBUM: PEYOTE HARVESTERS FACE SUPPLY-SIDE PROBLEM; SCARCE CROPLAND AND 
RISING DEMAND FROM NATIVE AMERICANS PITS TEXAS RANCHERS AGAINST THOSE LOOKING 
TO GATHER 'THE FLESH OF GOD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against a backdrop of rolling desert spiked with thornbush and mesquite, 
Salvador Johnson used a shovel to scoop up a mind-bending cactus that pops out 
of the ground like biscuits in this part of West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mira no mas! (Just look!). Here's a whole family of them," Johnson said as he 
filled a bucket with cactus tops lopped off at ground level to protect their 
turnip-like root. "Save the root and in a month, with a good rain, they'll be 
knockin' on the door to be harvested again." 
</P>
<P>
 The cactus is peyote, Lophophora williamsii , a plant revered by some Native 
Americans as "the flesh of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is one of eight people in the United States -- all of them in West 
Texas -- permitted to harvest the spineless, blue-green peyote buttons and sell 
them to Native Americans, who ingest them in religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 To get permission, an applicant must submit notarized letters of referral from 
local police to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the Texas 
Department of Public Safety. The federal permit costs $438, and the state 
charges $5; both are renewable annually. Before that, applicants must have a 
place to harvest peyote, which is getting harder and harder to find. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rio Grande Valley and northern Mexico are the only places in the world 
where peyote grows wild. And the peyoteros who collect it in hot and dry hills 
where everything seems to bite, sting or stick have a lock on an industry 
unique to Webb and Starr counties in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, they sold 1,978,646 peyote buttons for $210,247.60 under a 
cooperative agreement with state and federal law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For an estimated 250,000 members of the Native American Church in the United 
States and Canada -- the only group authorized by federal authorities to ingest 
the substance -- peyote is a divine gift, a sacrament consumed to focus 
worshipers' prayers to the Creator. 
</P>
<P>
 For the mostly Latino peyoteros , the ground-hugging plant containing the 
hallucinogen mescaline is a commerce by which the Native Americans' religious 
goals can be obtained at a cost of about 15 cents a button, or about $150 per 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there are fears that years of harvesting on the same plots -- coupled 
with increasing demand -- is tapping out available supplies, tempting peyoteros 
to expand their harvests beyond traditional gathering grounds long ago hemmed 
in by cattle ranches operated by often unsympathetic landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaction, cattle ranchers are asking for beefed up law enforcement to 
arrest trespassing peyoteros and their hired hands. In 1987, Johnson became the 
first dealer to have his license suspended when one of his pickers was caught 
trespassing on a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They caught some people on my land just two weeks ago," said ranch owner 
Robert East. "I don't want them here. That's all there is to it. I think it's a 
dope business, that peyote." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancher Rick Walker says he is also fed up with trespassers. But he suggested 
another reason for guarding the peyote gardens on his land. Peyote, he said, 
may one day become a hot commodity -- for ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other ranchers in the region, however, have started leasing portions of 
their property to peyote pickers on a monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 What all of this means for Native Americans is higher prices for their 
"medicine," which years ago virtually carpeted the desert floor in some regions 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson predicted that prices will double -- to $300 per 1,000 buttons -- by 
the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabel Lopez, a 72-year-old competitor in the peyote business who lives a few 
miles down the road in Oilton, agreed that "everything costs more today, and 
the Indians complain about this." 
</P>
<P>
 "My prices are cheap, but if there was more land, it would be even cheaper," 
said Lopez, surveying thousands of buttons spread out on drying tables in her 
back yard like so many potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong feelings stirred by the increasing scarcity of the drug may 
intensify this month when Congress is scheduled to debate pending legislation 
to overhaul the laws governing the use of peyote by Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 For Native American Church members, peyote use is not a federal crime. But a 
crazy quilt of state interpretations makes its use permissible in 28 states and 
illegal in 22 others. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Native Americans who travel thousands of miles to legally acquire 
their sacrament risk prosecution and imprisonment on their way home if they 
pass through a state that lists peyote as an illegal substance. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation would assure uniform protection of the religious use 
of peyote by Native Americans in every state and, in the process, possibly 
would place even greater demands on dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a possibility of shortage," said John Emhoolah, a Kiowa/Arapaho 
"road man," or leader of peyote ceremonies. "We need to think about buying land 
in Texas to harvest our own peyote . . . or reach an agreement with the Mexican 
government so that American Indians can cross the border and harvest it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyote flourishes in northern Mexico, but the Mexican government strictly 
forbids its possession or exportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Johnson, who grossed about $43,000 last year, says he is just 
trying to keep up with demand and make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love what I do, enjoy the hell out of it," Johnson said, hoisting a bucket 
full of peyote buttons into the back of his pickup. "But, hey, you don't get 
rich picking peyote. Just pay the bills, buy groceries." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumbling home along a red dirt road with Mexican music blaring from the radio, 
Johnson added: "A peyotero's life ain't easy, and it's gettin' harder all the 
time."

NORTH YEMEN FORCES CLOSE IN ON KEY PORT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northern forces have closed in on the port of Mukalla, a key southern 
stronghold, after consolidating their hold on the Indian Ocean coast that 
separates the city from the south's capital of Aden. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern officials say the leader of the southern revolt is trapped in the 
Mukalla area.The claim has not been confirmed but was strengthened Sunday when 
a U.N. envoy who has been talking with both sides about a cease-fire flew to 
Mukalla. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for the port involved some of the closest ground combat seen so far 
in the nearly 6-week-old civil war in Yemen, a poor nation of 14 million on the 
tip of the Arabian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern forces now control most of the 340 miles of shoreline from Meifa Hagr 
to Aden, the main stronghold of separatist leader Ali Salim Bidh, which has 
been besieged.

HAITI PUPPET PRESIDENT DECLARES EMERGENCY; CARIBBEAN: NO UNUSUAL MILITARY 
ACTIVITY IS EVIDENT. U.S. DIPLOMATS WARN ABOUT TREATMENT OF AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Haitian military's puppet president declared a state of emergency Sunday, 
stating that "our country is faced by extreme danger" and "risks invasion and 
occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 Emile Jonassaint, 81, who was installed as president last month, announced the 
decree in a speech on a television network to a population with few television 
sets and at a time, 2 a.m., when most of the country was without electricity. 
He gave no details about what the state of emergency would entail. 
</P>
<P>
 But his message brought denunciations from U.S. diplomats, who reminded the 
military and the Jonassaint regime that they are responsible for the safety of 
U.S. citizens as well as other international officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonassaint pointed to a perceived threat of military intervention, saying: 
"Tonight, I come to ask you . . . to mobilize for the defense of our country. 
Haiti will not yield to the foreigners' demands. . . . I order the commander in 
chief of the armed forces of Haiti to prepare for every eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
 No unusual military actions were evident. Roads remained open except for the 
roadblocks that have been erected for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 No troops were on the streets, the government made no move to take over radio 
or television stations, and no curfew was declared. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, William H. Gray III, the White House special adviser on Haiti, 
denied that the Clinton Administration has any timetable for a possible 
invasion of Haiti to overthrow the military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that that is not the case," Gray said, when asked about reports that 
the United States might invade Haiti by the end of July if economic sanctions 
don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley" that President Clinton has 
not ruled out the use of military force in Haiti, but he insisted that the 
Administration is keeping its focus on newly imposed economic sanctions for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has been under various economic embargoes since the violent ouster of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September, 1991. More stringent sanctions 
were applied last month and again Friday, when Clinton announced an end to air 
traffic and most financial transactions between the United States and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray also denied that the new sanctions will hurt the poor of Haiti and lead 
to an even larger flood of refugees seeking to come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who would suggest that these sanctions are impoverishing Haiti forget 
the fact that it's not the poor people of Haiti who are flying on American 
Airlines -- either economy class, business class or first class -- but it is 
actually the oligarchy and the military dictatorship that has caused the 
impoverishment of the people of Haiti," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has been ruled unconstitutionally since the military violently overthrew 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti hasn't had a rule of law for 2 1/2 years and hasn't followed the 
constitution anyway. So it is hard to imagine what he is talking about," a 
Western diplomat said Sunday of Jonassaint's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian military and police have been ignoring even Haiti's rudimentary 
legal code, arresting people without warrants, beating prisoners and, according 
to international human rights organizations, murdering citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Jonassaint asked the people to remain calm "and go about 
your daily business as normal." But he called on Haitians to be "determined 
like our ancestors to fight to the death," invoking the nation's founding 
fathers, who ousted French slaveholder colonists to win independence in 1804. 
</P>
<P>
 He also invoked Haiti's predominant voodoo religion, saying, "Haiti has 
protectors they don't know about" and ending the speech by invoking the name of 
Agawou, the voodoo god of strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer James Risen in Washington contributed to this report.

EU VOTERS TURN AGAINST ESTABLISHED PARTIES; EUROPE: GOVERNMENTS IN BRITAIN, 
FRANCE AND SPAIN RECEIVE SHARP REBUKES. AUSTRIANS OK MEMBERSHIP BY 2 TO 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in 12 nations selecting a new European Parliament turned against 
established parties in greater numbers than ever before and delivered sharp 
rebukes to ruling governments in Britain, France and Spain, according to 
preliminary results Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in Germany, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats gave an 
unexpected drubbing to the main opposition Social Democrats, did a major ruling 
party achieve a real victory. 
</P>
<P>
 As counting continued early today, the strong showing of Britain's Labor Party 
seemed to be enough to enable socialist-leaning parties to remain the largest 
single grouping in the 567-seat Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament, which acts as the legislative arm of the 12-nation European 
Union, is not as strong as national assemblies. But it recently gained new 
powers, including veto rights on key EU appointments and a degree of control on 
issues such as education, the environment and consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But with European issues often confusing and the Parliament itself a remote 
body, turnouts were generally low, frequently below 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absenteeism is worrying," said Jacques Delors, president of the EU's 
Executive Commission. "There can only be a (united) Europe if people show an 
interest in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Austrians seemed to have that enthusiasm, as voters participating in a 
national referendum accepted, by more than a surprising 2-1 margin, the terms 
of entry into the EU next January. 
</P>
<P>
 Austria's ringing endorsement of EU membership is likely to brighten the 
chances that similar referendums will pass in Finland, Sweden and Norway later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nations voting Sunday were Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, 
Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Britain, Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands 
voted Thursday. Final results are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 In most countries, the voting was a barometer of national government 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spain, where a series of scandals has rocked the government in recent 
months, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's ruling Socialists were headed for 
defeat for the first time since he rose to leadership 12 years ago, trailing 
the conservative Popular Party by 40% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, where Prime Minister John Major's Conservative government has 
lurched from crisis to crisis, the opposition Labor Party was on its way to 
taking about 60 of Britain's 87 European seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a victory would give Labor the largest contingent of seats from any 
national party and would keep the assembly's socialist group as the largest 
voting bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian voters once again rejected the traditional mainstream parties, giving 
an endorsement to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has shown that (voters) want to judge politicians not by labels but by 
the nature of their actions," Berlusconi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in Germany was the picture different. 
</P>
<P>
 With computer projections showing Kohl's ruling coalition winning 48 of 
Germany's 99 seats in the new Parliament -- and with the Christian Democrats 
also doing unexpectedly well in local elections held in five German states 
Sunday -- the chancellor seemed on course to once again defy the country's 
political pundits. Almost universally, they had written off his bid for an 
unprecedented fourth term as chancellor next October. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, the mainstream conservatives lost strength while the Socialists 
slipped below 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultra-right parties did well in Belgium, but they fared poorly elsewhere. 
Germany's extreme-right-wing Republicans disappeared from the Parliament 
completely, unable to muster the necessary 5%.

 The U.S. Conference of Mayors voiced objections to cuts in entitlement 
programs and the treatment of community service jobs that could put welfare 
recipients to work.But they said they support President Clinton's overall 
$9.3-billion plan because it is "generally consistent" with their own previous 
proposals. In an address to the mayors meeting in Portland, Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala said that she anticipates great input from 
local officials as the plan moves through Congress. The Administration plans to 
unveil the details Tuesday. "We want mayors to play a major role," Shalala 
said. "We are particularly mindful of the perspective you offer as 
representatives of many of this nation's low-income people."

 The American Medical Assn. chose the first black in its 147-year history to be 
the group's president-elect. Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, an internist from San 
Pablo, Calif., will take on the largely speech-making role a year from 
now.Bristow is now chairman of the AMA board and its only black member. He said 
race will not define his role "because, quite simply, it has not happened once 
in all the years that have been leading up to today." Bristow was unopposed for 
president-elect at the AMA convention in Chicago.

 Three Cuban nationals flew a 1940s-era crop-duster to the Florida Keys, where 
they landed at a U.S. Navy base and asked for political asylum. A Navy 
spokeswoman said pilot Ariel Correal Gonzalez, 29, had picked up his sister, 
Yenina Zabrana Gonzalez, and her husband, Frank Alberto Beads, both 23, as well 
as crop-dusting chemicals before taking off for Florida. Sunday's flight was 
the latest in a series of defections in which Cubans have stolen, borrowed or 
commandeered various aircraft to make the 90-mile journey to Florida.

PEROT GROUP FORMS NEW VIRGINIA PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Ross Perot supporters formed a new state political party and voted 
Sunday to back the Senate candidacy of independent Marshall Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, a former state attorney general and two-time unsuccessful Republican 
candidate for governor, said he welcomes the support of the new party, called 
the Virginia Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's support of Coleman was arranged by Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), 
the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner has said he cannot support Oliver L. North, the GOP nominee to unseat 
Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb. He said North is unfit to serve in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Independent Party will be run separately from United We Stand, 
America, Inc., the nonprofit group that is the successor to Perot's 
presidential candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot took 14% of the Virginia vote in the 1992 presidential election. Under 
state election law, if the party can document its Perot connection, it could be 
entitled to a slot on November's ballot, since he got more than 10% of the 
vote.
