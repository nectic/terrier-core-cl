WALL STREET TOUGHS OUT A ROLLER-COASTER DAY; BLUE CHIPS NOSE-DIVE BUT REGAIN 
GROUND; BOND MARKET GYRATES 
</P>

 Blue chip stocks closed solidly higher Wednesday, as bargain hunters' 
concerted buying of economically sensitive shares pulled the market out of a 
plunge of more than 50 points tied to concern about rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the government bond market, yields gyrated in unusually volatile trading, 
retreating from an early spike as investors emerged to grab bonds at lower 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.51 points to close at 3,831.74, after 
bouncing back from the 50-point loss in the first hour of trading. The drop 
triggered a New York Stock Exchange halt on index-linked trading. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the broader market, declining issues still outnumbered advancers by 
1,424 to 771. About 361.13 million shares were traded on the Big Board, the 
largest turnover since 376 million shares changed hands Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the NYSE's composite index fell 0.34 to 
257.47. The Standard & Poor's 500 index inched up 0.37 to close at 464.81, and 
the Nasdaq of mostly smaller stocks fell 5.76 to 782.88. On the American Stock 
Exchange, the market value index fell 3.64 to 466.32. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks fell early in the session in sympathy with bonds, which dropped sharply 
after a government report on personal income and spending was initially judged 
to portend higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The news sparked an early response in the bond market, sending the yield on 
the 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.85% -- its highest level since June -- from 
6.78% at Tuesday's close. It later retreated to close at 6.77%. The bond's 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, finished up 1/8 point, or $1.25 
per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said personal income fell 0.3% in January after rising 
0.6% in December. Consumer spending rose 0.5%, duplicating its December 
performance. Many analysts had predicted that both measures would rise 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also buckled early in the session under heavy sell programs, as 
investors bailed out in response to steep losses in stock markets overseas. 
Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average dropped 471.85 to 19,744.77 after a U.S. 
newspaper report that the United States was poised to impose trade sanctions on 
Japan sent stocks sharply lower just before the close. In Frankfurt, the 
30-share DAX average ended down 46.72 points at 2,020.33, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average fell 20.5 points to close at 3,248.1. Shares 
also closed lower in Paris and Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended 48.53 points higher at 2,562.68, a gain of 
1.93%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials sank 50.65 points to 3,756.04 in the first 15 minutes of 
trading, and the New York Stock Exchange invoked the so-called collar limiting 
sell programs until shortly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of sell programs early in the day," said Richard Meyer, head 
of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. "When that basically dried up 
and bonds started to turn up, guys started to put bids back into the 
marketplace. This is more of a technical bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the selling fervor were reports that Lehman Bros. analyst Elaine 
Garzarelli, a staunch bull, had gone bearish. Once Garzarelli confirmed that 
she remained positive on stocks, that helped the recovery as well, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bankers Trust fell 2 1/4 to 78 1/2 on market rumors that the bank was hit by 
heavy trading losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the situation called the rumors untrue, and a bank 
spokesman said operations so far this year have been profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citicorp fell 3/4 to 39 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among blue chip cyclical stocks, Alcoa rose 2 to 76 1/2; GM gained 2 3/8 to 
60 1/2; Caterpillar advanced 3 1/8 to 112. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto stocks rose with many economically sensitive stocks. General Motors rose 
2 3/8 to 60 1/2; Chrysler gained 1 1/8 to 57 1/2; Ford rose 1 3/4 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
 * AST Research fell 5 1/4 to 23 1/2 after dropping 2 3/4 on Tuesday. Analysts 
said the computer maker's sales growth rate will slow in its fiscal third 
quarter, which ends March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer lost 5/8 to finish at 35 5/8 after the company said it will 
cut the price on its PowerBook notebook and sub-notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paramount fell 27 7/8 to 48 1/8. Viacom completed a tender offer for a 
controlling stake in Paramount. Viacom Class B ended off 3/4 at 28. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico rose 1 to 67 1/4. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished lower against most foreign currencies, but managed to 
recoup some losses triggered by the release of German money supply figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign exchange traders said the dollar plummeted after Germany reported that 
its M3 money supply measure jumped 20.6% on an annualized basis in January 
compared to the average rate in the 1993 fourth quarter. The Bundesbank said 
the figure was distorted by special factors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many investors took the number as a sign that German inflation could 
come roaring back. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's cautious central bank, anxious to choke off inflation, has lowered 
interest rates very slowly and had been expected to drop them again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose after falling below the psychologically important level of 
1.700 German marks. It closed at 1.704 marks, down from 1.708. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's fall was broken in part because of rumors that the Bundesbank 
might lower rates slightly as early as today to prevent financial markets from 
panicking, said Amy Smith, senior currency strategist at the IDEA analytic 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also tumbled against the Japanese yen, after the New York Times 
said that President Clinton had decided to resume legal authority, through a 
mechanism known as Super 301, to slap trade sanctions on Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar dipped to 103.10 yen before recovering. It rose after U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor said the Clinton Administration was not trying to 
boost the yen to retaliate for the breakdown of trade talks. The greenback 
closed at at 104.15 yen, down from 104.60 yen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gold fell on the New York Comex to $377.80 an ounce, down 50 cents 
from Tuesday. Silver for current delivery closed at $5.276 an ounce, up 0.3 
cent.

47 SENATORS OPPOSE EPA'S PLAN TO BOOST ETHANOL USE; GASOLINE: AGENCY'S PROPOSAL 
SEEN INCREASING COST TO CONSUMERS AND CAUSING MARKETPLACE CHAOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost half the U.S. Senate sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency 
chief Carol Browner Wednesday urging her to drop a proposal to guarantee the 
use of ethanol in a big chunk of the market for anti-smog gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA made the proposal in December, even though its own scientists found 
that corn-based ethanol could actually bring more smog when it's added to 
gasoline in warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxygenates such as ethanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether, better known as 
MTBE, add oxygen to gasoline. This improves combustion and cuts emissions of 
carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both additives are already added to the gasoline sold in many cities 
in the winter, when carbon monoxide is a big problem, EPA scientists wanted to 
ban ethanol use in the summer because of its smog-forming tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn farmers cried foul. Banning ethanol in the summer would severely hamper 
its use in the year-round market for anti-smog gasoline, which starts in some 
areas in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to these complaints, White House and EPA officials came up with a 
plan that would force refiners making anti-smog gasoline to use ethanol or one 
of its derivatives -- ethyl tertiary butyl ether or ETBE -- for 30% of their 
oxygenate needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this plan, refiners could use ethanol or ETBE to fulfill the 30% 
requirement in the winter. In the summer, when smog is a significant worry, 
ETBE would be the only option for fulfilling the 30% mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 47 Senators are saying this is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge you to reject this market mandate and withdraw this proposal," they 
said in their letter to Browner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a longtime opponent of subsidies to ethanol 
makers, rounded up the signatures and signed the letter himself. Others who 
signed include J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), the chairman of the Senate Energy 
Committee, and the ranking Republican on that panel, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators say the ethanol plan will increase costs to consumers and cause 
chaos in the marketplace as refiners struggle to prove compliance with the 30% 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal could also make air pollution worse, they say, and it will 
certainly cut the revenue flowing into a federal trust fund for highway 
improvement.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: LOCAL BANDS MAKE GOOD; BILL AT ELECTRIC CIRCUS 
PROVES ALL IS NOT QUIET ON ROCK FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The local grass-roots rock scene has gone to pieces since the loss of 
Bogart's, the club that kept it glued together. But at least the pieces are 
proliferating. 
</P>
<P>
 Bands on the Orange County/Long Beach scene didn't stop dead with Bogart's 
closing three months ago. And in fact, O.C. has more options for local rockers 
now than in recent memory. The current roster includes Club Mesa and Our House 
in Costa Mesa, Club 5902 in Huntington Beach, Club 369 and the Fullerton 
Hofbrau in Fullerton and Caffe Nove, the Electric Circus and Linda's Doll Hut 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this proliferation of clubs is built around independent promoters who 
might do one or two shows a week; only the tiny Doll Hut can boast of running 
its own, self-contained rock 'n' roll business. Without a core alternative 
music club like Bogart's booking a full schedule highlighted by interesting 
national acts, the local scene is going to have a void at its center. For such 
a club to emerge will require a rare confluence of money, business smarts and a 
patron's enthusiasm that goes beyond profit maximization. We're waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, though, the current fragmentation offers lots of opportunities for 
fans with a taste for the unfamiliar to see, at low cost, what's out there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five local bands in search of a following shared a bill Saturday night at the 
Electric Circus, which has taken a step in the right direction by installing a 
rented sound and light system instead of relying on promoters to haul in their 
own each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there were six bands, but it would have been far better if Spent 
Idols, a punk-nostalgia act from San Diego County, had stayed home and left 
more room for their time-starved betters, who in some cases were limited to 
little more than 20 minutes onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing Hawthorn, with two albums and more than six years experience, was the 
best-established act on the bill. Still, most of its gigging has been in South 
County; Anaheim represented a move into less certain territory. Few of the 150 
or so in the club were there to see Standing Hawthorn, so it was a promising 
sign for the band that applause, scant at first, grew steadily as the 
abbreviated set went on. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing new or unfamiliar about what Standing Hawthorn does: U2 is a 
key reference point for an approach that strives for and readily achieves 
passionate intensity. Singer Paul Schulte gives the band a handsome focal point 
whose moves are devoid of preening and posturing. As he fervently sang lyrics 
about the heartache and confusion involved in the transition from adolescence 
to adulthood, Schulte grimaced and bent his body in ways consonant with the 
trials in the songs. His singing was clenched, his throaty voice strained with 
effort, but it packed sufficient power to stand the strain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The set's main drawback was the sameness of Schulte's vocal approach. It would 
help if he could take a break from titanic effort and approach certain songs 
with a poignant sweetness or a playful lightness that would complement the 
earnestness that is the primary slant of Standing Hawthorn's music. 
</P>
<P>
 The players backing Schulte seem capable of moving in any direction. By 
keeping a stable lineup for more than five years and by playing more often than 
most bands on the local alternative scene, Standing Hawthorn has emerged as a 
tight, assured unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Stoner (full name: Douglas Stoner Peterson) didn't stint on muscle yet 
did a deft job of accenting his work with tricky, motion-filled rhythm. Brent 
Loomis' bass often carried the melody while guitarist Chris Karn dabbed on 
colors and textures with a judicious use of distortion effects. 
</P>
<P>
 With its singer's sincerity and strong stage presence, a cohesive instrumental 
sound and a technical mastery evident on the new CD, "Itch," Standing Hawthorn 
has the grounding to move forward and experiment with a broader range of moods 
and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Babylonian Tiles cater to a specialized taste with their spooky Gothic rock. 
The band from Westminster didn't stir this audience, but its ability to 
re-create strong material from its debut CD, "Basking in the Sun at Midnight," 
suggests that it can connect with listeners who would enjoy a walk on the dark 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 With her elaborate eye makeup and a star painted in the middle of her 
forehead, singer Bryna Golden sat at her keyboards looking like a psychic. Her 
wan but expressive voice proved well-suited for relating tales set in the murk 
and chill of haunted castles, tombs and lonely garrets. Keyed by her '60s-style 
psychedelic organ playing and a good rolling and tumbling rhythm section, 
Babylonian Tiles mustered precision and drive on such songs as "No One Now" and 
"Crystal Gavel." 
</P>
<P>
 Slower passages were steeped in a B-movie eeriness that, delivered in a 
straight-faced deadpan, didn't take itself too seriously. This is a band that 
folks with a little Morticia Addams in them might find as tasty as hemlock tea. 
</P>
<P>
 The clear crowd favorite was Cake, the band that emerged from Long Beach about 
a year ago from the wreckage of a progressive-pop band from Orange County, 
Imagining Yellow Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cake builds upon the stormy, mysterious side of the Suns, playing an intense, 
trippy throwback to '60s acid rock. Drummer Rob Fadke (Suns fans may remember 
him as Fadtke; he recently dropped the "t") laid down consistently heavy, 
hypnotic beats out of the Led Zeppelin canon. There was no chiffon or whipped 
cream in this Cake. Steve Cross, the other IYS alum, slashed out thick, chordal 
guitar leads while performing with his customary intensity and athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing the singing and fronting duties with Cross, Rebecca Lynn brought a 
playful dimension that clashed with the heavy and portentous mood of the music 
but made for a more entertaining show. She came out in long johns, hot pants 
and a horrid wig, a haystack of curls, and smiled often when not sawing out 
eerie Transylvanian airs on her electric violin. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Cake seems primarily interested in creating body music that is 
pure physical sensation. It succeeded, judging from the reaction of the fans 
who crowded the stage front and did loping, bobbing dances. The songwriting 
remains a question mark -- most of the set offered diffuse melodies and lyrics 
impossible to discern through the din. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross and Lynn have the makings of a good harmony-singing team; one hopes that 
Cake won't be so enamored of creating a hypnotic and mystical effect that it 
forgets to exploit their vocal ability. What's called for is a layer Cake that, 
along with the heavy batter, includes some smooth filling and a melodic icing. 
</P>
<P>

 Burnin' Groove finished the long evening with a late-late set (having the last 
notes ring at 2 a.m. is one Bogart's custom that ought to be retired). The band 
-- with its slicked-back, '50s-inspired handsome bad-boy look, punk rawness, 
street-level attitude and kinetic, perpetual motion approach to performance -- 
no longer can boast the bluesy, biting guitar work of Frank Agnew, who left to 
join Rule 62. His replacement, Jared Carlson, played gritty but unremarkable 
rhythm guitar. Lead player Andrew Galvez stepped forward with some stinging 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The front man, Daren Carlson (Jared's younger brother), was full of animal 
spirits, singing in a chesty voice that occasionally took its cues from Mike 
Ness of Social Distortion. While he is no pure singer, Carlson has decent 
range, and the four other members readily joined in for exuberant and catchy 
sing-along choruses. 
</P>
<P>
 The set included some good material, including guilty-pleasure novelty 
"Bimbo," a wired, careening number called "Anybody See" and a suitably crunchy 
cover of "Time Warp" from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnin' Groove has the look and aggressive sound to cast it as a contender for 
the local equivalent of mass popularity. Moe's Art, which played early on the 
bill, is at the other end of the local spectrum: It's a modest, unassuming band 
playing less for the possible glory of it than for the enjoyment and the 
creative outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The foursome, fronted by singer-guitarists Jeff Fairbanks and Al Olefer, had 
one foot in the garage and another stepping toward the avant-garde. Fairbanks, 
formerly the singing drummer of Don't Mean Maybe, is a good high-range singer 
who displayed a bit of a David Byrne yelp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacket," an oldie from his Don't Mean Maybe days, was the most distinctive 
number with its nervous, rapidly circling motion. "Flower Song" also worked 
well, calling to mind some of the pop-oriented yet off-kilter tone of the 
underrated albums Jack Bruce made in the late-'60s immediately after Cream's 
breakup. Olefer's sharp, clean guitar work and Jim Monroe's hefty drumming 
enabled Moe's Art to rock in its understated, slightly left-of-center fashion.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'SNOOPY' CAST NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE GANG; THE BEAGLE AND HIS 
SIDEKICK ARE JUST FINE IN THIS YORBA LINDA CIVIC LIGHT OPERA PRODUCTION, BUT 
OTHER KEY FIGURES SEEM LIKE ONLY SUPPORTING PLAYERS.

 The success of any live version of a comic strip is the ability of the 
director and cast to submerge their own personas and transmogrify their 
existence into the world of the strip's readers' imaginations. It's 
particularly difficult in the case of Charles Schulz's "Peanuts," which readers 
have had decades to become a part of. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera, co-director/choreographers Tim Kashani 
and Joshua Eklund come close to making their production of "Snoopy -- the 
Musical" live in Schulz's world but miss just barely enough to take the edge 
off an energetic and inventive production of this second musical based on the 
goings-on of the "Peanuts" kids and their friends, the intrepid beagle Snoopy 
and his sidekick Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason might be that Kashani plays Snoopy and Eklund plays 
Woodstock. They're both just fine in the roles. Eklund even looks amazingly 
like Woodstock and has the little feathered fellow's benign complacency and 
willingness to do anything to please Snoopy. And Kashani's Snoopy is a lithe 
ball of fire, the best dancer in the cast, has the best musical comedy voice, 
and eagerly goes beagle-istic at the drop of a top hat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But they are the directors. Maybe another director could have made them look 
even better. That third eye often makes the difference. A different hand might 
also have pulled the whole cast into an ensemble, so important in this kind of 
show. As it is, Charlie Brown (Steve Glaudini), Linus (Chris Sands), Sally 
(Heather Dickenson), Lucy (Sarah Ramsey-Duke) and Peppermint Patty (Aimee 
Boice) look like a supporting cast, which should never be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaudini's supercilious grins, Sands' stunned double-takes, Dickenson's 
suburban complacent self-righteousness, Ramsey-Duke's Scarlett O'Hara 
crabiness, and Boice's baby-earth-mother honesty work beautifully, and they all 
sing quite well, but their ensemble playing is apart from that of Kashani and 
Eklund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only other problem with the production is Edward Huber's lighting design, 
which boggles the imagination, and sometimes the vision, often pairing a 
glaring backdrop with dimly lit performers. Huber seems unsure of which 
deserves prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Right on the target is Mitchel Hanlon's musical direction, sharp as the 
co-directors' choreography, full of pizazz and savvy.

THEATER REVIEWS; WHERE THERE'S A 'WILL,' THERE'S A WAY TO PULL IT OFF; UNDER 
SOLID DIRECTION, THE SAN CLEMENTE COMMUNITY TROUPE OVERCOMES DATED BITS TO MAKE 
THE COMEDY AND SENTIMENTALITY PALATABLE AT THE CABRILLO PLAYHOUSE.

 As funny, sentimental old crowd-pleasers go, "Daddy's Dyin' . . . (Who's Got 
the Will?)" still has what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's dated in places (a "cute" marijuana-smoking hippie character would 
have made much more sense in the '60s). But for the most part, this slickly 
told tale of four perfectly awful sibs, home for their father's imminent 
funeral, still has some great one-liners tempered with a little tugging at the 
old heartstrings -- even if it doesn't offer a great deal to think about 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Under confident comic direction by Matthew Rauchberg (responsible for the 
company's intense "A Delicate Balance" last year), the San Clemente Community 
Theater makes it all go down easy at the Cabrillo Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep in the heart of Texas, Buford Turnover (Bill Adams), a widower, is dying. 
He has had a stroke that makes him forget little things -- like where he put 
the will and who gets what. His mother-in-law, Mama Wheelis (Penny Radcliffe), 
takes care of him, as does one of his children, Sara Lee (Chris Culver 
Vibrans), a beautician who lies about having a fiance to cover her lack of a 
personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 The other children who gather to see Buford are Lurlene (Barbara Hollis), who 
alienated her father years ago by leaving the farm to preach the gospel with 
her husband; Orville (James B. Faris), a "sanitation engineer" whose idea of a 
great gift for his wife is earrings picked up in a dumpster, and Evalita (Janet 
Lee), who brings home the hippie as her sixth husband-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 The more rotten the kid, the funnier the part. Faris really has a time doing a 
mean-spirited, pot-bellied Orville, with his omnipresent Dallas Cowboys hat and 
sneer for his wife, Marlene (Pamela Siegel-Berryhill), who, in an equally nice 
performance, gives him back great dead-panned put-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 The real find in this cast, though, is Radcliffe as Mama Wheelis. Whether the 
wiry, silver-haired actress is knocking Orville's hat off his head as he sits 
down to dinner, berating the other brats or trying to remember the pearls of 
wisdom she's learned on "Hollywood Squares," she offers the acid-tongued voice 
of reason amid the craziness, driving the action with impeccable timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Vogler's set makes the stage look deep with intriguing angles. There also 
are comfy, lived-in detailing and wallpapered hallways (but Vogler has 
committed the scenic sin of putting up a clock with hands that don't move. 
Nothing is more distracting than seeing time not pass). 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who has some fun prancing around in spike heels and short-shorts as 
Evalita (the one who feels terrible when she inherits a disproportionate amount 
of the money, though not terrible enough to share it), also did the lovely 
musical arrangements for the two hymns in the show.

 Gains for Women: Women are making strides in network news, according to an 
annual review by the Center for Media and Public Affairs. The nonpartisan 
research group found that women reported 23% of all network stories last year, 
up from 13% in 1990. The group also found that 11 of the 50 most visible 
reporters on national network newscasts were women, with NBC's Andrea Mitchell 
leading both men and women with 175 appearances last year. Minorities didn't 
fare as well: only CBS's Giselle Fernandez (24th) and Bill Whitaker (25th) were 
listed among the 50 most visible correspondents. CBS was the most diversified, 
with women reporting 34% of stories on the "CBS Evening News," compared with 
19% on ABC's "World News Tonight" and 16% on the "NBC Nightly News." Racial 
minority groups reported 24% of CBS's news, compared with 10% at ABC and 4% at 
NBC.

 Heeeeere's the Video!: If you're not happy with the current late-night fare, a 
home-video collection of Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" episodes will be 
available in May. The four-volume set will feature episodes hand-picked by 
Carson and compiled by former "Tonight Show" producer Jeff Sotzing. Released by 
Buena Vista Home Video, the tapes will span Carson's "Tonight Show" career from 
the 1960s through the '90s, and include sketches, bloopers, behind-the-scenes 
footage and his entire farewell episode. The cost: $14.99 each or $59.99 for 
the boxed set. Carson Productions and Buena Vista, which are billing the tapes 
as "the definitive Johnny Carson collection," say these will be the only Carson 
episodes ever released on video. MOVIES

 Spielberg Watch: Steven Spielberg won't allow his multiple Oscar nominee, 
"Schindler's List" to be shown in the Philippines because censors there ordered 
cuts on nude and sex scenes. The Movie Television Review Classification Board's 
order drew protests in Manila Wednesday, with one senator urging that the board 
be abolished. The board objected to three specific scenes, two showing women's 
breasts and one showing Schindler making love with his mistress. Rather than 
make the cuts, which would have amounted to about 30 seconds of the three-hour 
film, Spielberg withdrew the picture from Philippine cinemas. Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos promised to look into the board's decision.

 Not Making an Oscar Visit: Guests will be coming to the 66th annual Academy 
Awards from all over the world, but two dancers from the Ballet Nacional de 
Cuba won't make the March 21 date. The U.S. State Department has denied their 
visas because most Cuban dancers must give some of their earnings to the 
government. The dancers would have performed with other top dancers from 
countries including Russia and China, in a ballet highlighting the nominees for 
best music score. Also sending its regrets to Oscar: the Maori canoe crew from 
"The Piano." Not enough money could be raised to get the boat and its crew to 
Los Angeles. POP/ROCK

 Rally Counters Pearl Jam Show: A coalition of Pensacola, Fla., churches is 
planning a "Positive Life Rally" on Wednesday in response to a Pearl Jam 
concert in the city that night. The concert will benefit the abortion rights 
group Rock for Choice and will mark the one-year anniversary of the shooting 
death of Dr. David Gunn outside a Pensacola abortion clinic. Rally organizer 
David Hutchinson says the demonstration is not to protest the concert, but to 
encourage anti-abortion youth to express their views. "We're saying both sides 
are extreme, and we're saying don't kill, either way," he said. Pearl Jam 
manager Kelly Curtis says the band will participate in future Rock for Choice 
events. "We would have been surprised if there wasn't a counter demonstration," 
he says.

 No Hard Feelings: Frank Sinatra has no hard feelings about being cut off 
abruptly while accepting a Grammy Legends award during Tuesday night's Grammy 
telecast, a spokeswoman for the singer says, confirming reports that Sinatra's 
people were involved in the decision to end his speech. "The most important 
thing about the evening is that Frank Sinatra had a wonderful time and feels 
positive about everything that went on," the spokeswoman said Wednesday. "The 
combined production teams were sensitive to the timing of the show. He was 
having a great time . . . (and) was very moved by the tribute." QUICK TAKES

MUSIC REVIEW; THE SOMBER SIDE OF BARITONE DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the real Dmitri Hvorostovsky please start singing. 
</P>
<P>
 When the indecently gifted Siberian baritone first visited Southern 
California, back in 1989, he was a 26-year-old unknown among a flock of uneven 
Russian hopefuls chaperoned by the noted mezzo-soprano Irina Arkhipova. On that 
scraggly occasion, he sang a few arias and folk songs to a virtually empty 
Wilshire Ebell, but the one delirious critic on duty -- this one -- ventured 
that Hvorostovsky "could have the world at his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he began winning glamorous international contests, recording so-called 
classical as well as schmaltzy albums that hit the charts, and making debuts 
with major opera companies. Sometimes its nice to be able to say I told you so. 
</P>
<P>
 The conquering hero returned for a mostly effective recital in La Jolla during 
the 1990 season. He concentrated this time on esoteric art songs and popular 
arias. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Bowl discovered his sonorous tones and matinee-idol persona last 
September when he joined John Mauceri and the loose-limbed weekend gang in the 
wide-open spaces for some explosive odes to Russian opera followed by assorted 
folksy ditties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That night, he even mustered two performances of "Dark Eyes," the gushing 
platitude that the hype machines are turning into his signature tune. The fans 
swooned. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one approached Hvorostovsky's debut recital at the 
Music Center on Tuesday with some trepidation. Would he dabble in slick 
show-biz indulgences, or would he show his serious side? 
</P>
<P>
 He showed his serious side. To a fault. He made no concessions, allowed no 
compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 Did I say serious? Make that somber. No, make that dour. Would you believe 
bleak? Dreary? How about gloomy? 
</P>
<P>
 His intentions no doubt were noble. He wanted to introduce some little-known 
music. He wanted to avoid cliches. He wanted, bless him, to take a few chances. 
He wanted to make his listeners think, not just bask in the shadowy, sensuous, 
wide-ranging lines he so easily produces. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, Hvorostovsky gave us too much of a brooding thing. For 
all his good taste and soulful suavity, he courted monotony. Compounding the 
problem, his expressive utterances didn't seem to project very far into the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Intimacy is a fragile commodity in a 3,200-seat 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 For warm-up exercises, he began the relatively brief if demanding program with 
three Purcell songs, surprising his listeners with fluid English diction and 
reasonable agility, confounding them -- for a while -- by changing the order. 
Contrary to printed promises, "Music for a While" came last, not first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shostakovich group that followed offered three striking samples of 
introspective Weltschmerz . In "Fragment" (1952), Hvorostovsky aptly invoked 
the bitterness of Pushkin. In two Spanish folk settings (1956), he cleverly 
fused the mock-Mediterranean flourishes with proper accents of Russian 
lamentation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only bow to familiar repertory -- and a modest bow at that -- involved 
Ravel's "Don Quichotte a Dulcinee." Remembering, perhaps, that these melodies 
were originally intended for Feodor Chaliapin, Hvorostovsky added a few strokes 
of extrovert drama to the subtly inflected cantilena. His pitch may have sagged 
occasionally, but his French was suitably suave and neatly pointed. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came the test: A soulful cycle of 12 songs in the darkest 
Soviet-Realist tradition by Georgi Sviridov entitled "Otchalivshaya Rus' " 
(Russia Cast Adrift). It was written, we think, in 1956 when the 
Soviet-laureate composer was 41 (the Philharmonic program didn't deem it 
worthwhile to tell). 
</P>
<P>
 Using poetic texts by Sergei Essenin, the rather simplistic settings explore 
various socio-political shades of what the quaintly inadequate annotator 
labeled Slavophilia. Without transliterations (the sponsors provided 
translations but no original texts), it was difficult to follow the composer's 
rambling course of emotional appeals. As the scholar Colin L. O'Riordan 
observed of Sviridov, "his major achievement is in the thorough fusion of words 
and music in a manner directly appealing to Russian audiences, although his 
work is less convincing to listeners lacking the required linguistic and 
ideological background." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one could do little but sit back, relax, and admire 
the singer's obvious dedication. Also his dynamic flexibility and climactic 
fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 The large but non-capacity audience began to shrink with the final cadence. 
Hvorostovsky rewarded those who stayed to cheer with a pair of encores. He went 
for Baroque once more with an obscure aria of Antonio Caldara, and then sang -- 
in one, long, poignant breath, it seemed -- "O, Carlo, ascolta" from Verdi's 
"Don Carlo." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Arkadiev was the ever-attentive, ever-supportive accompanist.

THEATER REVIEW; WILL & CO.'S 'MUSKETEERS' SHORTENS THE SWORDPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't expect Will & Co.'s new "family accessible" production of "The Three 
Musketeers" at the Los Angeles Theatre Center to be a faithful staging of 
Dumas' swashbuckling saga. 
</P>
<P>
 If you thought the Disney version took liberties. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In this hourlong show, kicking off Will & Co.'s "Quicktakes" series for family 
audiences, a cast of six youthful adult professionals, led by the company's 
artistic director Colin Cox, plays multiple roles.Among them, the veteran Cox 
as Athos and Philip Lester as D'Artagnan demonstrate the most polish. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors wow the littlest, action-hungry audience members with lots of 
swordplay. They drop puns and make contemporary references -- Rochefort (Benito 
Martinez) and Richelieu (Edgar Landa) break into "One Singular Sensation" from 
"A Chorus Line" and D'Artagnan hip-hops to "Whoomp! (There It Is)." 
</P>
<P>
 They also have out-of-character exchanges with the audience. After some 
energetic and fairly adept group sword-clashing, Cox turns to the audience and 
pretends to preen over his "lovely choreography." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the adult references, however, this bare-bones show, presented in the 
center's cavernous Theatre 2, will appeal primarily to very young children, who 
are able to suspend disbelief and overlook uneven performances more readily 
than their elders. At a recent matinee, despite the broadly comic shenanigans, 
several tykes were shouting vocal encouragement as D'Artagnan clashed with the 
Cardinal's guards: "You can do it, D'Artagnan!," "Win, D'Artagnan, win!" 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming shows planned for a "Quicktakes" treatment: "The Odyssey," "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream," "Macbeth," "Hamlet" and "Romeo & Juliet." 
</P>

CLUB REVIEW; COUNTRY FEVER HITS HARD AT VENERABLE OIL CAN HARRY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oil Can Harry's is a senior citizen by nightclub standards -- it has been on 
its corner in Studio City corner for some 25 years. But if you haven't ventured 
into this primarily gay dance club in recent months, you're missing out on an 
L.A. delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil Can Harry's has country fever. And the club, which sports an interior that 
might be described as "Urban Cowboy" meets "Twin Peaks," is novice-friendly. 
Harry's, which is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, offers free country dance 
lessons on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:45 p.m. until 9:15 p.m. The deejays 
announce the artists and the song titles before each selection to help 
familiarize first-timers with the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Favoring Patsy Cline and Hank Williams from the old school and Randy Travis, 
Clint Black and George Strait from country's modern ranks, guests get to 
practice a variety of line dances, from the boot scootin' boogie and the tush 
push to the freeze and roll-back-the-rug. 
</P>
<P>
 The directness of the lyrics in such numbers as Daron Norwood's "Honky Tonk 
Heartache of the Year" and Tanya Tucker's "Some Kind of Trouble" perfectly 
suits the uncomplicated, jig-like movements of the dancers -- who by night's 
end are likely to include the doorman, the bartender and even the deejay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil Can Harry's, 11502 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 760-9749. Cover 
charge of $3 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. HEIDI SIEGMUND

TV REVIEW; ABC'S 'BYRDS OF PARADISE' WHISTLES A MAUDLIN SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You wonder about Hawaii-based TV series like "The Byrds of Paradise." Do they 
come up with the idea first, or the catchy title? It couldn't be "The Smiths of 
Paradise"? "The Schwartzes of Paradise"? 
</P>
<P>
 Or does the attitude come first? Premiering at 8 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 
3, 10 and 42), "Paradise" is a pleasant enough family drama, but it's also a 
tidal wave of predictability that wears its warmth like a grass skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently widowed Sam Byrd (Timothy Busfield) has given up his job as a Yale 
philosophy professor for a headmaster's post at a small private school on a 
lush Hawaiian island, where he and his family have moved into a grand yellow 
house on the Pacific. But Sam's three kids -- gregarious, 16-year-old Harry 
(Seth Green); brooding, 15-year-old Franny (Jennifer Love Hewitt); and feisty, 
11-year-old Zeke (Ryan O'Donohue) -- are having a rough adjustment. Encumbered 
by his "mainland mentality," Sam, too is reeling from culture clash, among 
other crises. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first 24 hours at Palmer School, Sam suspends a student out of 
ignorance, Franny steals the family car, Harry is tormented by locals and Zeke 
is "depantsed" by his new classmates and gets into trouble with the police. 
"You're having a busy day, Mr. Byrd," a cop tells Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so busy, however, that these snafus can't be tidied up by the end of the 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances are nice, with Hewitt especially winning as the fitful 
Franny. Series creators Channing Gibson and Charles H. Eglee have written one 
very amusing scene in which a flower child applies for a job as the Byrd's 
housekeeper after living nude in the rain forest for years. And the Hawaiian 
locations and prominence of local actors give "Paradise" an appealing ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 What literally ruins this series, though, is its absence of surprises. You 
always know what's coming. When Byrd inadvertently splashes mud on and angers 
striking Healani Douglas (Elizabeth Lindsey) while driving to school on his 
first day, for example, you know she'll end up working at the same school (as 
dean of students, in fact). 
</P>
<P>
 And no loose ends either. The last 10 minutes of the premiere and next week's 
episode are mea culpa time, with all protagonists re-examining their klutzy 
behavior and deciding to reform, becoming bigger and better for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 At the maudlin conclusion of tonight's hour, the Byrds bury their own 
differences while standing before a volcano, but it's viewers who get 
splattered by ooze.

 David Smith's large, steel sculptures have been characterized as "drawing in 
space," but Tiffanie Morrow's sculptures might be construed as "writing in 
space." Geometric and linear, her painted-canvas constructions at Newspace pull 
Smith down to earth -- way down, so you have to kneel to see them properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Marching along the floor like lines of text, these works reward the effort by 
being ever-so-politely grammatical, in the sense that grammar is always marked 
by internal logic. Yet, as with any grammar, you are lost if you don't know the 
rules. Without a primer or lexicon to guide us, the meanings of Morrow's 
messages remain indecipherable, forever just barely out of our grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Projecting vertically from half-inch strips, Morrow's 3-D pictographs allude 
to such architectural forms as archways, ramps and pergolas. These references 
press issues of scale and of the body's position in the space carved out by a 
work of art. This is the province of Minimalism. The only titled piece in the 
show, "Undertow," is explicit in suggesting the extent to which Morrow's art is 
engaged with the philosophical propositions of this historical style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undertow," an uninterrupted expanse of solid black, measuring 6 inches high 
and more than 34 feet long, leans against the wall with precarious grace, 
conjuring the work of Richard Serra. Serra's massive structures underline a 
sense of danger and, thereby, the unequal power relations between artist and 
viewer; but Morrow's slight, virtually weightless art is altogether different. 
It turns Serra around, configuring the viewer's body as dominant and the work 
of art as conditional. 
</P>
<P>
 Both less and more threatening than her Minimalist predecessor, Morrow allots 
the viewer power, but also responsibility, insinuating that it is up to us to 
guard the art object's fragility. What's more, we're left alone to figure out 
how to derive meaning from the experience.

 Photo as Art: When Man Ray photographed the Marquise de Casati in 1922, he 
gave her, in typical Surrealist fashion (by accident, that is), three pairs of 
brilliant, black eyes. She was said to have adored the photographer's mistake, 
his vision of woman as uncannily, dangerously all-seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Photo-Secessionist Baron Adolfe de Meyer photographed the Marquise a 
decade earlier, she was depicted as a chic patron-muse, her intense gaze framed 
by a pair of bejeweled hands and a fur collar and muted by a soft-focus lens 
seemingly designed with flattery in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 If De Meyer's portraits are less than probing, they are nonetheless 
fascinating, especially in terms of the history of fashion photography. Sixteen 
of De Meyer's photogravures are on view at G. Ray Hawkins Gallery. The 
selection, which also includes still lifes and genre scenes, recapitulates the 
presentation of De Meyer's work in the October, 1912, issue of Alfred 
Stieglitz's famous periodical, Camera Work. 
</P>
<P>
 De Meyer, like the other pictorialists Stieglitz favored, was committed to 
"art photography." It was paramount that the image be more than a mere 
document; the artist was to soften edges, refine compositions and forge beauty 
where the ordinary threatened to appear. De Meyer's still lifes are gorgeous -- 
transparent vases catching and reflecting the light, with darkened petals 
silhouetted against hazy backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 De Meyer was indeed a great manipulator of light and shadows. In his portrait 
of the dandyish Teddie, the subject is situated within a stylishly Cubist 
milieu of juxtaposed light and dark. The effect De Meyer achieves, however, is 
strictly formal: Psychological complexity is beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
 De Meyer's Orientalist fantasies are likewise oblivious to their own subtexts. 
The visual tropes of one ethnographic image -- dark skin, glistening earrings, 
turban and mysterious smile of Aida, a Maid of Tangier -- are reinvented as 
fashionable accouterments for well-bred ladies in other images. For De Meyer, 
beauty provides its own social agenda, a notion that bears close consideration, 
especially in terms of the contemporaneous work of Henri Matisse, whom 
Stieglitz featured in Camera Work just three months before De Meyer's debut 
there.

 Thin on Attitude: For better or worse, William Quigley's new paintings at A/B 
Gallery are Julian Schnabelesque in their bravado. Quigley eschews the 
smash-and-grab aesthetic of Schnabel's broken plate extravaganzas, as well as 
the shock-meets-schlock ethos of his velvet paintings. But like Schnabel (at 
least early on), he piles on the paint as thick as the attitude, while trying 
to decide if he is for real or strictly for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Quigley makes huge, collage-like paintings that stick representational images 
smack in the middle of Abstract Expressionist tableaux. Princes on horseback, 
court jesters, bucolic landscapes and 19th-Century ladies of fashion (as 
soignee as any by John Singer Sargent or Giovanni Boldini) jostle for space 
with messy drips, heroic swaths and sheer masses of paint. That these works are 
propped up on wooden legs or swathed in white fabric cocoons seems more than 
incidental; they need help, as they don't know what they are or what they want 
to become. 
</P>
<P>
 It was either a strategic mistake or a stroke of brilliance to feature, in the 
middle of all this, a video monitor hanging from red bungee cords, playing a 
tape of the artist in dark glasses and goatee, rambling on, dancing like a 
madman and flinging brushes around his studio. I suspect it was the latter, for 
the tape evinces a certain salutary self-consciousness, a take on the mythology 
of the artist-hero almost as ironic as Schnabel's. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the paintings don't display this irony on their own. 
Despite their bluster, they are tentative and suggest Quigley still has a lot 
of thinking to do.

 Glorious Machines: "Contemporary Constructivism in the West" at Boritzer/Gray 
Gallery features the work of four disparate artists, all of whom take on the 
nonobjective project pioneered early in this century by artists such as Kasimir 
Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin and Vasily Kandinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Day's lacquered steel constructions enact Constructivism's familiar visual 
tropes, albeit with mechanical torpor. The Constructivist ethos stresses the 
glories of machine culture, but Day's bold colors, geometric shapes and force 
lines are depressingly formulaic, every element both simplified and 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Musgrave's paintings exploit the same visual cues, but the works are far 
less facile, blending flat and illusionistic elements with plucky grace. David 
French's small, wall-mounted sculptures of wood eschew Musgrave's compositional 
clarity and historicist wit in order to further Constructivism's spiritual 
agenda. His works summon our attention with authority, like ancient totems or 
latter-day Rubik's cubes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Florence Pierce, however, who justifies the show. As a member of New 
Mexico's Transcendental Painting Group of 1938-1941, Pierce was among the 
earliest practitioners of nonobjective art in the United States. Her most 
recent work consists of a series of dazzling poured-resin "paintings," made 
without any paint at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Geometric reliefs are laid on grounds of reflective acrylic and then dipped in 
milky coats of resin. The subtle tonal gradations and fugitive passages of 
transparency conspire against the rigorous, minimal compositions. The result is 
work that is quiescent yet restless. Pierce's art argues that Constructivism 
remains workable and seductive; its legacy has yet to be fully mapped.

 Boskovich Farms already sells convenience spinach triple-washed and trimmed, a 
10-ounce package that is the equivalent of three bunches. The back of the 
package also gives instructions for cooking, including steaming and microwaving 
techniques, and salad ideas. This month it will make the last part obsolete 
when it introduces a spinach salad-in-a-bag, complete with Henri's salad 
dressing and Marie Callender's cheese and garlic croutons. In Southern

 Hmm. According to the National Live Stock & Meat Board, London broil is not a 
cut of meat but a recipe: marinated beefsteak, broiled and sliced across the 
grain. Furthermore, the traditional cut for it is not what many butchers call 
London broil (which is often a cut of chuck or top round) but flank steak, and 
the recipe first surfaced not in London but in this country, in 1946. New

They come salted or unsalted, either as pretzel sticks or in a superimposed N

ALL EGGPLANT, ALL THE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Bulent Basol, president of the Assembly of Turkish American Associations, 
called to invite me to a Turkish meal of eggplant, I thought he was kidding.  
</P>
<P>
 He sensed my hesitation. " All eggplant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pause. "Really." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Basol, whom I had met at yet another Turkish food function some years 
back, explained what he meant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eggplant plays an important role in Turkish cuisine," he said. "They say 
Turks have more than 100 ways of preparing eggplant. We want to show you some 
of the ways. It will give you an idea of how versatile eggplant can be, while 
introducing a very healthful food that is not terribly well known." 
</P>
<P>
 Aubergine , the French word for eggplant used almost universally in the food 
world, is indeed a healthful and beautiful vegetable with a purple color so 
subtle and exquisite as to inspire fashion designers from season to season. It 
has a history so glamorous, and cuisine so appealing -- if you know how to use 
eggplant -- it does give one pause.  
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, I accepted the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant is actually the fruit of a plant that originated in India and 
traveled East to Asia and West through the trade routes of the Middle East 
before making it to France in the beginning of the 17th Century. In Asia, 
eggplant is an important and popular crop, with China leading in production, 
followed by Japan, where slim, elongated varieties are preferred. Locally, 
eggplant is popular, but through much of the United States, it is still 
considered a specialty item, with the bulk of the crop coming from Florida, 
Mexico and California. Today, many varieties, from the large bulbous fruit to 
the tiny egg-size white eggplant and the long, thin, small eggplant, are 
available almost year round. Overall production is growing steadily, but in 
small increments. For instance, it's a fraction of the production of squash in 
the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant will probably never become as popular in the U.S as it is in Asia or 
Turkey, but interest is growing. "As people understand that eating fresh fruits 
and vegetables promotes good health and fights cancer and heart disease," says 
Barbara Buck, chief executive officer of the Fresh Produce Council of 
California, "they will be looking for more ways to use exotic vegetables such 
as eggplant." Nutritionally, eggplant is extremely low in fat and calories 
(about 20 calories per 100-gram serving), and contains some protein, vitamins 
(A and B) and minerals (calcium and iron). Because of its meaty pulp, eggplant 
has long been used in main dishes, such as casseroles ( moussaka , for 
instance), stews and vegetarian meals. 
</P>
<P>
 It is said that when Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was in Istanbul as 
guest of Sultan Abdulaziz, the Ottoman emperor, she became intrigued with a 
puree of eggplant that had been the specialty of the Topkapi Palace, home of 
sultans and harems for several centuries. She asked her host if he would allow 
his chef to teach her cook how to prepare it, and the sultan obliged.  
</P>
<P>
 But the French chef was given no measurements and asked to be relieved from 
the duty of making a dish that was cooked by "eye and nose." The empress 
returned to France without the recipe. Back at the palace, however, the dish 
was renamed in her honor. To this day, eggplant puree, a dish served as an 
accompaniment to stews and roast chicken, is called hunkar begendi , meaning 
"the sultan approved it."  
</P>
<P>
 No cuisine makes more glamorous use of eggplant than the Turkish. In the hands 
of Turkish cooks, eggplant takes on numerous guises, whether stuffed with rice 
and meat, laced with sauces, or combined with other vegetables in perfect 
flavor integration. 
</P>
<P>
 So I sat with Dr. Oguz Celikkol, the consul general of Turkey in Los Angeles, 
and Basol and his wife, Sema, sampling a parade of eggplant dishes from 
appetizer to salad.  
</P>
<P>
 "You realize, of course, that in Turkey, as elsewhere in the world, the most 
famous cooks have traditionally been men," said the consul with a teasing 
smile. But the consular household has a woman chef who prepared the dishes and 
emerged only long enough to set a plate on the table and serve the last 
beverage of the meal -- a thick brew of Turkish coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sema Basol, who helped translate the cook's tips, frying the 
eggplant, even when it us used as a stew, helps impart extra flavor often 
lacking in boiled or baked eggplant. "Olive oil, particularly, gives eggplant a 
delicious flavor," said Basol. Another important tip: Soak eggplant halves or 
slices in salted water for 30 minutes to leach out bitter flavors before 
frying. "Most people object to the rather bitter taste of eggplant if not 
properly leached," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Freezing eggplant, while possible, is not recommended, according to Basol. 
"Turkish cooking doesn't lend itself to freezing or prolonged refrigeration. We 
like our foods to be eaten freshly cooked. Standing in the freezer or the 
refrigerator will cause flavors and texture to deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first dishes to arrive was an appetizer known as patlican salatasi 
(eggplant salad), which requires mashing of the eggplant pulp. Pureeing is 
easily achieved by baking the large eggplant in the oven to soften the flesh. 
The eggplant is peeled and flesh mashed as you would potatoes. Small eggplant, 
such as the elongated, slim eggplant or small novelty egg-size eggplant, can be 
scorched over flame until soft enough to mash. Eggplant puree, which becomes a 
beautiful cream-white color when mashed, can be dressed as you would any salad 
with lemon juice or vinegar and oil. The puree can also be combined with cheese 
and cream to serve plain ( begendi ) or baked as for a gratin (also called 
gratin in Turkey). 
</P>
<P>
 Patlicanli kebab is not what we usually think of as kebab, but eggplant made 
into a stew with pieces of lamb and eggplant. (Of course, eggplant can be made 
into kebab -- cut into large cubes, threaded on skewers and cooked on the 
barbecue grill.) For a stew, eggplant is added to the meat and cooked until the 
meat and vegetable juices mingle. The dish is usually served over plain or 
tomato-flavored rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Moussaka, another famous dish found throughout the regions around Turkey and 
Greece, is simply a casserole layered, lasagne-fashion, using ground meat and 
slices of eggplant in lieu of pasta. The eggplant slices are best fried for 
extra flavor before being added to the casserole. Moussaka is a popular main 
dish/buffet dish that's also budget-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its shape, eggplant lends itself easily to stuffing with rice and 
ground meat, or with vegetables for a vegetarian meal. Its meaty pulp makes a 
perfect boat or cavity for a filling meal. The consul's table included eggplant 
stuffed with rice and meat, called zeytinyagli patlican dolmasi , as well as 
tiny patties of eggplant fried in olive oil. EGGPLANT KEBAB

to taste with salt and pepper. Cook over low heat until meat is tender, about 
40 to 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cut stems off eggplant. Peel off 1/2-inch-wide strip of eggplant 
skin lengthwise, at 1-inch intervals, creating striped effect. Cut eggplants 
crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick round slices. Place slices in deep pan and 
sprinkle generously with salt. Fill pan with cold water. Let stand 30 minutes 
to leach out bitterness of eggplant. Rinse eggplant slices with cold water and 
pat dry with paper towels. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt 3 tablespoons butter in skillet. Add eggplant slices, few at time (do not 
crowd pan), and fry until lightly browned on both sides. Continue to add more 
butter and fry eggplant until all eggplant slices are used. Place 1 layer of 
eggplant slices in bottom of large skillet. Spread meat mixture on top. Slice 
remaining tomato. Garnish meat mixture with tomato slices and green pepper 
rings. Cover and cook over medium heat 20 to 25 minutes. Serve with Tomato

 Heat oil in saucepan. Add eggplant slices and fry until golden-brown. Do not 
overcook. Drain on paper towels. Continue to cook eggplant slices until all are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate skillet melt butter. Add onion and ground meat and saute until 
meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Add peppers and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Peel 
and dice 2 tomatoes and add to skillet. Add 1/2 cup water. Season to taste with 
salt and black pepper. Saute 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange half of fried eggplant slices in large skillet. Spread meat mixture 
over eggplant layer. Arrange remaining eggplant slices over meat mixture. Slice 
remaining tomato and arrange slices over eggplant layer. Sprinkle with chopped 
parsley. Add 1 cup hot water. Cover and cook over medium-low heat 30 minutes or 
until eggplant is tender. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

AN EARLY SPRING; CONFESSIONS OF A POD PERSON

<P>
 As a child, the only way I could eat peas was to pretend they were pills and 
swallow them whole, washed down with milk. Imaginary pneumonia, flu and 
intolerable insomnia were cured at the dinner table.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking a sleeping pill," I'd announce, then down the pea and produce 
great, grunty whistling snores until my mother said, "That's just about enough, 
thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 Now I grow my own peas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, I bedded dried, shriveled pea seeds in damp rags and left them 
on my water heater. When they sent out inquisitive white roots, I planted them, 
one per inch, in my garden. I planted Sugar Snap edible pod peas and shelling 
peas with a transvestite's name: Wando. 
</P>
<P>
 Wando peas, I read on the packet, needed support. When the vines got a little 
length on them, I stuck part of an old expandable wooden gate in the ground. 
The plants tried the gate -- they twirled these heartbreakingly tiny tendrils 
around the wood -- and let go, as if they'd decided instead to sprawl across 
the ground, flirt with the dark forces of rot and mildew. I kept introducing 
them to the gate without result. Peas, like teen-agers, often don't know what's 
best for them. Eventually, I tied them up. For their own good. 
</P>
<P>
 After some weeks, there was an outbreak of white flowers that looked like 
profiles of women in bonnets. These blossoms dried up and fell away to reveal 
inch-long green crescents. When the sun hit these crescents, tiny embryonic 
peas could be seen, rows of apostrophes. Next, the pods grew thick and the peas 
stayed tiny. Then the peas fattened up, filled out. 
</P>
<P>
 I opened pods of stunning symmetry -- perfect green spheres with the tiniest 
hitch holding them to the pod. There's nothing dearer than peas in the pod, 
nothing in the vegetable kingdom at any rate. And they're so sweet, they taste 
already cooked.  
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled around my garden, popping peas. Reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time my Wandos were coming into their perfect selves I was reading 
"Simple Food" by John Thorne. In his preface, Thorne writes about how recipes 
are only re-creations; the process of coming up with a recipe, with all its 
decisions and confusions, is not apparent to the cook who follows a recipe. 
However, as soon as cooks start comparing cookbooks with each other, they get a 
sense of how many decisions are inherent in the simplest recipe. To illustrate 
this point, Thorne introduces his readers to a particularly controversial and 
versatile dish: risi e bisi , rice and peas.  
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding risi e bisi is based on what, exactly, risi e bisi 
is: soup or risotto. Thorne lines up the sides: Marcella Hazan and Ada Boni say 
risi e bisi is soup. Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson vote for risotto. A 
browse through the Italian cookbooks in any collection, even my own limited 
home collection, expands upon this controversy. Lorenza di Medici votes for 
soup, Gioletta Vitale puts rice and peas together in something closer to a 
pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne, after sorting through a slew of risi e bisi permutations, presents his 
own recipe for a soup and a risotto. Both recipes contain the same ingredients 
and differ only in proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it's difficult to go wrong with the dish, given the ingredients: rice 
and peas in combination are inarguably pleasurable. Soup or risotto, risi e 
bisi can bear the imprint of any good cook and still be delicious -- proof that 
there is no single path to the marvelous.  
</P>
<P>
 Thorne himself says, "Even if you have never heard of this dish before, you 
probably have some idea as to how you would go about making it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed.  
</P>
<P>
 I had enough of an idea that, when a friend called and confessed that, having 
eaten it many times in Italy and New York, he was something of a risi e bisi 
expert, I invited him over for dinner. Risi e Wandi. 
</P>
<P>
 My first decision was: risotto. I was in the risotto camp. Sorry, Marcella. 
</P>
<P>
 My version, I already knew, would differ from Thorne's recipe in certain small 
ways. For example, I liked the idea, mentioned and rejected by Thorne, of using 
the shucked pea shells in the broth. Finally, in a constant effort to find more 
vegetarian dishes for an increasingly large circle of vegetarian friends, I 
resolved to create a vegetarian risi e bisi and bought a bag full of broth 
vegetables at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, my deli man offered me a nice thick slab off the end of a prosciutto 
for the price of pancetta. 
</P>
<P>
 In his preface, Thorne writes of "ferment, the confusion, the groping before 
the moment that shaped the dish." That was me as I stood, oscillating at the 
counter, resolve weakening, face-to-face with a bargain piece of Parma ham. I 
bought some, just in case I changed my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Home again, I picked a basket of peas, shucked them in the late afternoon sun 
on my front porch and considered more decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Should I, as Thorne instructed, cook the peas separately from the risotto and 
add them at the last minute? Would they really break down if stirred in the 
risotto? The peas themselves formed an answer: Small and medium-sized peas were 
so tender and sweet, they required only heating. The larger peas, especially 
those grown so plump they had flattened sides from pressing up against each 
other in the pod, were starchier and did require some cooking. I doubted very 
much if these vigorous Wandos would turn to mush under the spoon. Since it 
required very little extra effort, I separated the peas into large starchy peas 
and smaller sweet peas. Those in between? Into my mouth.  
</P>
<P>
 As I shucked away, I also remembered a 5-year-old boy I once knew whose mother 
asked him to grate cheese for enchiladas she was making. This boy liked the 
rubbery curls of grated Jack cheese so much, by the time he finished grating, 
there was nothing in the bowl -- he'd eaten the whole half-pound block. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about this boy because a similar phenomenon was happening with me 
and the cunning little Wandos: a mounting pile of empty pods, very few peas in 
either bowl. Finally, when pressed with the prospect of shucking peas into the 
next century, I mustered enough self-restraint to come up with a cup and a half 
of peas. 
</P>
<P>
 I put the broth vegetables, big fat handfuls of shelled pea pods and water on 
to boil. I grated the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, chopped the onion and parsley 
and, in case I decided to use it, the prosciutto. 
</P>
<P>
 I had more time to fret and grope as the broth bubbled: how much butter should 
I use, for example? Thorne's recipe, with one cup each of butter, Parmesan 
cheese and rice, read like a prescription for an underweight prize fighter: too 
rich for my sedentary blood. Also, did I want to use butter only, or butter and 
olive oil, my usual choice for the initial sauteing step in a risotto? 
</P>
<P>
 I set the table, fed the pets, checked a few more recipes, fished a potato 
chunk out of the broth and ate it, salted, with a drop of olive oil. When the 
broth was fragrant and flavorful, I strained it and took the plunge. My guest 
was coming in half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I used butter and olive oil. And I put in the prosciutto. I added 
the large peas earlier than I needed to, but it didn't matter much: The husky 
Wandos didn't break down in the stirring; they just turned a grassier shade of 
green. The smaller, sweeter peas, added in the last three minutes of stirring, 
kept their innocent, sweet, fresh-picked flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 My guest arrived in the last few minutes of my stirring. He poured mineral 
waters and then stood by the stove and tasted, helping me to locate that moment 
of perfect doneness, which indeed happened just like that : chalky one moment, 
perfect the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows if my decisions were crucial or not? At the very least, they left 
the basic, extraordinary pleasure of rice with peas undiminished. The risi was 
creamy and bumpy, a pleasure similar to -- but more adult than -- tapioca. The 
bisi, gloriously round, rolled and popped in the mouth like plumped warm 
caviar. Put together, scented with parsley, studded with chewy and subtle 
prosciutto, the stuff was irresistible, nubbly mouthful after mouthful. I'd 
made four servings. We ate them all. RISI E BISI 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 large onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 thick slice of prosciutto (approximately 1/8-inch thick), cut into small 
cubes

<P>
 Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, freshly grated 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons Italian parsley, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter and olive oil in heavy saute pan over medium heat. When butter 
starts to foam, add chopped onion and prosciutto. Saute until onion is 
translucent. Add rice. Saute until rice turns opaque, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour 2 ladles (approximately 1 cup) boiling Vegetable Stock into rice and 
stir. Stir constantly, allowing stock to be absorbed, and adding more stock 
when none is pooling up in pan. Keep adding boiling stock and stirring, about 
15 minutes. Add peas and start tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Add more boiling Vegetable Stock. Keep stirring. When peas brighten in color 
and rice is chewy without being chalky and has thick sauce, stir in 1/2 cup 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Serve immediately, sprinkled with chopped parsley. 
Pass additional freshly grated cheese and pepper. Makes 4 servings.

IN THE KITCHEN; FAINT PRAISE FOR SKINNY ASPARAGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to asparagus, I'm afraid my tastes are a bit, shall we say, 
infra dig. While the trends seem to dictate that to be up-to-date in your 
asparagus selection you must select only the slenderest, weediest stalks, I 
have to confess that I like 'em large. 
</P>
<P>
 No stringy little waif look for me. I like asparagus fat and I like it cooked. 
Give me a plate of asparagus thick as my pointer-finger. Peel them, boil them 
in their own juices well past al dente and then dress them in nothing but a 
little really good olive oil, salt and pepper and maybe just a single sunbeam 
of lemon juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus cooked this way has an almost decadent, mousse-y texture. It tastes 
like the essence of the vegetable turned into butter. And what could be better 
than that? 
</P>
<P>
 But I will make one big exception at this time of year. With the worst of 
winter safely behind us, but the full flower of spring still a storm or two 
away, one of my favorite light suppers is a frittata made with the thinnest, 
wildest-looking asparagus you can find. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin asparagus works best for this dish because it seems to give up its flavor 
to the butter and eggs while at the same time it retains its texture better. It 
looks prettier too. There is something primal about a thick, soft pillow of 
golden eggs shot through with wiry little lengths of asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
 Metaphorically, I'm on solid ground here: Asparagus and eggs are both age-old 
symbols of the coming of spring, and there's not a heck of a lot else in the 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, there's an equally sound gastronomic argument to be made. 
Eggs and asparagus are one of those archetypal taste combinations. And when 
they are cooked very simply, you get the full effect of the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 When hollandaise sauce -- really nothing more than scrambled eggs with a 
Cordon Bleu education -- was first poured over boiled asparagus, this is 
probably the combination the cooks were trying to improve upon. 
</P>
<P>
 A properly made frittata will have almost the same rich, eggy flavor, and the 
texture -- moist and melting -- shouldn't be far off either. Though the 
frittata is commonly called an Italian omelet, I think it has more in common 
with good old American scrambled eggs, if you make them right. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooked this way, the frittata should be lightly browned on top, but as 
undercooked inside as you can stand it. I'm a sunny side-up guy myself, so I 
like my frittatas pretty soft inside -- a creamy rather than airy egg. If 
you're going to serve it at room temperature, though (and they're almost as 
good this way), cook it a little drier. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting just the right degree of doneness takes close attention and a little 
manipulating of the fire. The eggs will be just at the right stage when they 
shine on top and still hold their shape. Flip them quickly, just to set the 
bottom, and serve, dusted with a bit more cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 The other difference between a frittata and an omelet is that with a frittata, 
the asparagus has a chance to cook with the eggs, rather than being something 
added at the last minute. This way there is a subtle transfer of flavors from 
the asparagus to the butter to the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's beautiful and it's delicious, but I know it's a temporary thing. By the 
time Easter rolls around, I'll be safely returned to the more opulent charms of 
my real love and all of its zaftig glory. ASPARAGUS FRITTATA 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound thin asparagus, unpeeled, ends trimmed 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 9 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Cut asparagus into 1 1/2- to 2-inch lengths, reserving tips. Melt butter over 
medium heat in non-stick 9-inch saute pan. Add asparagus stems, not tips, and 
cook, stirring occasionally, until stems begin to soften, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In mixing bowl, lightly beat eggs with water and 2 tablespoons cheese. Eggs 
should lighten slightly but should not foam. Add asparagus tips and stir well. 
</P>
<P>
 Add egg mixture to saute pan. Cook 1 minute, then begin forming frittata, 
pushing sides of egg mixture into center, allowing liquid eggs to come in 
contact with pan. Continue pushing, without stirring, until eggs on bottom are 
solid and just beginning to brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Cover with lid and 
cook last minute, to set top of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Place dinner plate directly over saute pan and, firmly holding plate and pan 
together, invert, so eggs come out onto plate. Remove pan from plate, return 
pan to heat and slide eggs back into pan so that eggs are now upside-down. Cook 
another 1 to 2 minutes, depending on how runny or firm you want frittata to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, place pan (oven-proof only) under broiler and cook just long 
enough to puff top and brown lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Slide frittata out onto clean plate. Dust top with remaining 2 tablespoons 
cheese. Season lightly to taste with salt. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>

 292 calories; 399 mg sodium; 505 mg cholesterol; 22 grams fat; 6 grams

WINE: BREATHING: WHO NEEDS IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've all heard the sommelier ask the question: "Shall I open the wine and let 
it breathe?" 
</P>
<P>
 Breathe? The word makes me giggle. If wine had the ability to breathe, 
wouldn't it have strangled long ago inside a corked bottle? I imagine a gagging 
sound coming from the neck of the bottle, and me giving the Cabernet CPR. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breathing the wine" is in large part a lovely myth. The word breathe refers 
to the aeration a wine gets, supposedly to improve it. This is not entirely 
true. It is true that wine is a living product and the more air it gets, the 
more it changes. And some air may well be a good thing for some wine. But not 
for very many. 
</P>
<P>
 Very young, tannic red wines may improve with some aeration, and splashing 
them roughly into a decanter or water pitcher will give them the shot of air 
that will "open" some of the aromas and flavors. But otherwise, decanting is a 
ritual best reserved only for wines you know very well. 
</P>
<P>
 If you know that an older wine has developed a fine-grained sediment, you may 
wish to stand the bottle upright for a few hours or a day, allowing the gunk to 
settle to the bottom, and then slowly pour the wine off the sediment. After 
that, pour the wine immediately into glasses so it can be consumed. Keeping a 
fragile wine airing in a decanter may harm its aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Very old wine is especially sensitive to this treatment. Not long ago I 
brought a 1964 Echezeaux to a friend's house for a dinner party and he left the 
wine in the kitchen, intending to open it just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Some well-meaning oaf spotted the bottle and decanted it. More than an hour 
later, when the wine was served, everyone remarked about the oxidized aroma, 
the brown color and the rancid, raisiny smell. This was a bottle I was pretty 
sure had been well stored, but the premature aeration had destroyed the wine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same tack, in 1986, a close friend poured a bottle of 1881 Chateau 
Lafite for a dinner party. He didn't decant it, but poured it using a special 
gadget that tilts the bottle very slowly. He was thus able to pour the wine 
into glassware directly from the bottle without much of the sediment getting 
into the glasses. (These gadgets are very expensive; what's more, I don't think 
they work any better than a steady hand.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 1881 Lafite was spectacular -- for about half an hour. After that it 
started acquiring a smoked-bacon aroma. An hour later, the wine was dead. 
Decanting it would only have hastened its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened two years earlier with a bottle of 1945 Chateau 
Latour, and the same thing happened in 1991 with a bottle of 1961 Barolo. 
Decanting was avoided; the wine aroma was preserved. I am convinced that had I 
decanted these older wines, the aromas would have fled. 
</P>
<P>
 As for young wines, I once developed a tongue-in-cheek system for decanting 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 Wine geeks like to say that a young wine will sort of "age" as it breathes, 
based on the length of time it's in the decanter. They say that the formula is 
an hour per year; that is, if you air a wine in a decanter for three hours, 
it's like aging that same wine in a cellar for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 This is bunk, of course. Nothing replaces time in the cellar for maturing a 
wine. But it is true that very young wine can be very "tight" and awkward when 
first opened, and that a little aeration can help. Recognizing that these young 
wines didn't need gentle handling and the more splashing they get the better, I 
created what I called the Berger System for Decanting Young Wine.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea is that time in the decanter isn't as important as the height from 
which you decant the wine, and that a foot equals one year. Thus you could 
imitate 10 years in the cellar by decanting the wine from a height of 10 feet. 
This system never caught on (at least in civilized neighborhoods), in part, I 
suspect, because wine shops don't sell ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wines that need gentle decanting to get them off the sediment should be 
handled carefully so the sediment doesn't get all stirred up. First, take such 
bottles from their reclining position and look at the neck to see if any 
sediment is collected there. If it is, jostle the bottle so the sediment is 
jarred free and can float to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the wine rest a day or two (a few hours at least). Then carefully remove 
the cork, wipe the neck with a rag, and pick up the bottle. Aim the neck of the 
bottle into a decanter, and place a light source underneath the curve in the 
bottle. Tradition says to use a candle, but a flashlight works as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly pour the wine into the decanter, watching the curve of the bottle for 
the cloud of sediment that will soon appear. When you see it, stop pouring. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've left a lot of wine in the bottle, you may want to pour it through a 
coffee filter, or simply ignore it and pour a bit more. The sediment is 
harmless, though it might be a bit gritty.  
</P>
<P>
 And as for the sommelier who asks if the cork should be pulled to let the wine 
breathe, here is the answer: Simply pulling the cork and leaving the bottle 
open on the table does little to benefit a wine. Not enough air gets into the 
bottle to open up the aroma of a young wine, and doing this needlessly 
endangers the delicate nuances remaining in an older wine.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: PUPUSA-O-RAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Gold 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consider the pupusa : a dense, griddle-baked corn thing filled with goodies, a 
UFO-shaped Salvadoran snack that is something like a shotgun wedding between a 
tortilla and an Italian calzone. When a pupusa is good, it is very, very good 
-- crisp-edged and speckled brown, hot-corn fragrant, oozing salty melted 
cheese. When confronted with a pupusa , you may want to garnish it with a bit 
of the spicy Salvadoran cabbage slaw curtido that is always served alongside, 
and perhaps with a splash of tomato sauce from a cruet. Like a roadside 
hamburger, even when a pupusa is bad, it is still pretty swell. 
</P>
<P>
 As ice cream comes in strawberry, chocolate and vanilla, pupusas come stuffed 
with either cheese, sometimes flavored with a Salvadoran vegetable, loroco , 
that looks a little like asparagus but has a sharpness something like capers; 
or with chicharrones , bits of fried pork skin, or revueltas , a mixture of 
cheese and chicharrones and -- sometimes -- beans. (It is often hard to imagine 
getting less than everything: my usual order is revueltas .) 
</P>
<P>
 Pupusas are generally served at Salvadoran specialty restaurants, pupuserias , 
of which there are hundreds in central Los Angeles alone. Occasionally, 
Salvadoran restaurants seem very much alike -- volcano posters, swaying music, 
and an unchanging menu of fried plantains, small grilled steaks and pupusas -- 
but they also tend to be dependable and cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, I spent a couple of afternoons flitting from place to place, trying 
to figure out what a perfect pupusa might be, and while I didn't come up with 
anything approaching an archetype -- there are several styles that I think are 
equally good -- I ate a lot of good food. And I can think of at least a dozen 
pupusas that I like but didn't have time to get around to, among them the 
greasy, delicious pupusas sizzled in oil at the big swap meet at 45th and 
Alameda; the plain cheese pupusas at El Sataneco on Pico; the fat, loroco 
-filled pupusas at Papaturro on Beverly; pretty much everything on the menu at 
El Nica. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlacatl is on the swank side, maybe one of the best full-service Salvadoran 
restaurants in town, with a CD jukebox and wonderful tamarind drinks, and 
terrific chicken with onions. Pupusas here serve mostly as appetizers, though 
pretty much everybody here seems to get one or two, and they're great, 
especially the revueltas : clear corn flavor from the crisp masa shell, large 
amounts of milky, salty cheese and a great, almost caramelized roast pork. I 
especially love the burnt, leathery amoebas of porky cheese that had oozed onto 
the grill, probably a technical flaw but a nice thing to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, the bare-bones Usuluteco is sometimes considered the classic 
Los Angeles pupuseria , and on weekends the lines are long, and people stagger 
out of the restaurant with great armfuls of steaming pupusas -to-go. The 
pupusas are very good here, thin-shelled, very crisp but somehow pliant, filled 
with great gobbets of cheese, beans and pulverized pork, the kind you feel you 
could eat 20 of: an epitome of the pupusa as street food. The similarly named 
but separate Usulutan in Silver Lake has pupusas proper though somewhat bland, 
but spiced up with spicy ultra-fresh curtido.  
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant Cabana may have been the first place I ever ate a pupusa back when 
the space housed El Mr. Cat No. 1, but although the fork-wielding cat is still 
painted above the front door, the pupusas were only of average quality in this 
pleasant dining room, slightly rubbery and with curtido that tasted uncannily 
like deli coleslaw. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ilopango, a cheerful, converted fast-food stand near Loyola High School, 
the pupusas were over-fried into a carbonized stiffness. El Pulgarcito, 
attached to a market across the street from Westlake Park, is well known for 
its pupusas made from rice flour, which were tasty if more crunchy than crisp. 
La Teclena is a real big-city kind of place on the busy corner of Vermont and 
Pico, the former site of a Mexican restaurant Mimi Sheraton called the city's 
best, and the pupusas were fine if not startlingly good -- there was a strong 
taste of overcooked pork. 
</P>
<P>
 Texis is one of the most reliable of the chains, decked out with a million 
neon signs and a riot of silver foliage, and the pupusas are a little careful, 
almost tender rather than crisp, with a mild smack of corn. El Amancer is a 
homey place whose pupusas are on the soft side, with neither crust nor crunch 
but a certain richness and a distinctive, tart-hot slaw: a house style that may 
change the way you think about pupusas.  
</P>
<P>
 But even at the meanest takeout stand, a pupusa is handmade in a way that, 
say, tacos rarely are -- patted to order, toasted brown, served just at the 
point when it has been transformed from masa into thing. It is always 
comforting to hear the predictable slap-slap of your pupusa being made about 30 
seconds after you have placed your order.

LOW FAT: PEACHES AND CREAMY -- NO FAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA DEANE, TIMES FOOD STYLIST

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flavor of this deceptively rich-tasting nonfat custard is brought out by 
the tang of the fresh peaches. Great peaches won't come into season until July 
or so, but you can get Chilean peaches right now in supermarkets -- they aren't 
as good as the summer fruit, but sometimes it's hard to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonfat dry milk, along with nonfat milk and nonfat egg substitute make for a 
silky-smooth custard that contains only a trace of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook the custard by putting the baking dish in a second dish filled half-way 
up the sides with warm water. This gentle method of baking will prevent 
curdling because the water bath keeps the custard from getting too hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove the custard from the oven when a knife inserted in the center comes out 
clean. Take the custard out of the water bath immediately and cool on a rack 
until just warm. This custard is best when eaten right away -- it tends to 
become watery upon standing. PEACH CUSTARD

GOOD COOKING: HOW GREEN WAS MY GRANNY SMITH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the going gets rough in the kitchen, I know I can always count on crisp, 
juicy Granny Smith apples. 
</P>
<P>
 They were originally imported from New Zealand and South Africa in the 
mid-1950s. Today, many come from the prime apple-growing valleys of central 
Washington state.  
</P>
<P>
 Available year-round, light-green Granny Smiths have a tart, tangy flavor and 
firm flesh, qualities that lend themselves to all aspects of cooking. They're 
also excellent for out-of-hand eating. However, they will become mushy and lose 
their shape when overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following recipes for a salad, a quick bread with fresh apple 
butter and a warm apple compote. All feature Granny Smiths in combination with 
apple cider and orange zest, two ingredients that enhance the apple's appealing 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The apple salad with Belgian endive and watercress is a lightened version of a 
typical winter bistro salad; it's refreshing, light and filling in a healthful 
way. It's best served as a first course or as a lunch salad.  
</P>
<P>
 The apple quick bread with prunes and walnuts is delicious slathered with 
fresh apple butter. The warm curried apple compote with apricots and raisins is 
a low-fat enhancement to many meats, especially leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 A word about citrus zest, an ingredient I use in many of my dishes to boost 
their flavor. Some readers have asked about it recently. The zest is the 
aromatic colorful outer skin layer of citrus fruit; it must be removed with the 
aid of a citrus zester (available in cookware shops), a fine grater or a 
swivel-bladed vegetable peeler or paring knife, all very sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid removing the white part of the rind, called the pith -- it's bitter and 
tastes unpleasant. Sharp tools and a light hand will eliminate taking the pith 
with the zest. Only the colored outer skin has the aromatic oils that, in 
truth, add a flavorful "zest" to any dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Moist with apples, prunes and cider, this bread can be served as a simple 
dessert, with soup or with salad suppers. It's perfect combined with the fresh 
apple Granny Butter, especially when the bread is toasted.  
</P>
<P>
 APPLE, PRUNE AND WALNUT BREAD WITH GRANNY BUTTER 
</P>
<P>
 Cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons cider 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, cut into 1/2-inch chunks (2 1/3 
cups) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup snipped prunes 
</P>
<P>
 Granny Butter 
</P>
<P>
 Sift 2 cups cake flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, baking soda and salt onto 
sheet of wax paper. Set aside.  
</P>
<P>
 Combine oil, sugar, eggs and vanilla in large mixer bowl. Beat 3 minutes. 
Mixture will be thick and smooth. Add sifted ingredients, cider and orange zest 
to mixer. Mix to combine. Toss apples, walnuts and prunes with 1 tablespoon 
flour in bowl. Then stir into batter with wooden spoon. Batter will be very 
thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Generously grease 8x4-inch glass loaf pan. Lightly dust pan with flour, 
tapping out excess over sink. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Smooth surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on center oven rack at 350 degrees until wood pick inserted into center 
comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. If bread begins to darken too 
much toward end of baking, lay piece of foil gently over loaf to prevent from 
burning.  
</P>
<P>
 Remove from oven. Let stand on cooling rack 5 minutes. Invert bread onto rack. 
Let cool completely. Bread, wrapped airtight, will keep few days at room 
temperature or frozen 3 months. Cut into 1/3-inch slices. Serve with softened 
Granny Butter. Makes 1 (8-inch) loaf, or about 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 535 calories; 196 mg sodium; 76 mg cholesterol; 29 grams fat; 68 grams 
carbohydrates; 5 grams protein; 0.81 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Granny Butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped Granny Smith apples 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine, softened 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon allspice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 Soften apples in microwave oven on HIGH power (100%) in microwave-proof dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine apples with butter, allspice, sugar and salt in processor fitted with 
metal blade or blender until smooth. Transfer to small souffle dish. Can be 
made few days ahead and refrigerated. Let come to room temperature before 
using.  
</P>
<P>
 This salad is a long way from Waldorf salad. It's light and refreshing, a lift 
to almost any meal, especially when it's the first course. Toasted walnuts, 
crumbled blue or Roquefort cheese can be sprinkled on the salad, although for 
my taste, these typical garnishes on winter apple bistro salads are not 
required. To get a head start on the salad, toss the apple slices in a little 
dressing to keep them from turning brown; they will keep for about one hour in 
the refrigerator.  
</P>
<P>
 APPLE SALAD WITH BELGIAN ENDIVE AND WATERCRESS 
</P>
<P>
 4 medium heads Belgian endive, about 5 ounces each, cut crosswise into 
1/3-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
 1 large bunch watercress, long stems trimmed, rinsed 
</P>
<P>
 2 large Granny Smith apples, unpeeled, split, cored with melon baller, thinly 
sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Cider Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 Combine endive and watercress in large bowl. Keep chilled until serving time. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, add apples to greens. Toss with Cider Dressing. Serve on chilled 
dinner plates, dividing salad evenly. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 189 calories; 190 mg sodium; trace cholesterol; 14 grams fat; 17 grams 
carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.77 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Cider Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 1 small shallot, minced  
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons cider  
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Combine shallot, cider, vinegar, oil, orange zest, mustard, honey, salt and 
pepper to taste in processor fitted with metal blade or blender. Blend. Can be 
made day ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 This compote goes especially well with roasted chicken, duck, game, pork, ham, 
lamb and shrimp. Stirring a small amount of butter into the mixture at the end 
of cooking rounds out the flavors of the compote.  
</P>
<P>
 WARM CURRIED APPLE COMPOTE WITH APRICOTS AND RAISINS 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup cider 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon curry powder 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, cut into 1/2-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup snipped dried apricots 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 Combine cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cider in small dish until smooth. 
</P>
<P>

cider, brown sugar, curry powder and salt. Cook over medium-high heat until 
thickened, about 3 minutes, stirring often. Add apples, raisins, apricots and 
orange zest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, uncovered, until apples are just tender but not falling apart like 
applesauce, about 13 to 15 minutes, stirring often. Stir in butter until 
melted. Can be made few days ahead and refrigerated. Gently reheat on stove top 
or in microwave oven, adding little cider or water as necessary. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Serve warm. Makes 3 cups, about 6 servings.

GARDEN FRESH; RUTABAGA TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rutabagas don't look very inviting. Unlike ruffly red lettuce or sculptural 
shoots of asparagus, these rough, baseball-sized, brownish-purple and buff 
roots don't beg to be taken home.  
</P>
<P>
 But if you never take them home and eat them, you'll never be tempted to grow 
them. And home-grown rutabagas are worlds tenderer and tastier than 
store-bought. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretend you don't know what potatoes taste like. How promising would they 
look? So buy three or four rutabagas and be prepared to find beneath their 
rough exterior a heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The flesh of rutabagas is a luminous rosy-yellow that turns pale-pumpkin in 
cooking. Its flavor is sweet -- yes, sweet. Imagine a blend of sweet carrots, 
sweet parsnips and the sweetest turnips of spring. That's rutabaga. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you do with them? One of the tastiest ways is what the Scotch call 
bashed neeps. The diced and simmered roots are mashed and seasoned with salt, 
pepper, nutmeg, butter and cream. A Scot has called this "a dish fit for a 
queen." 
</P>
<P>
 For the shy vegetable eater, the most disarming introduction to this funny 
vegetable may be a blend of half-mashed neeps and half-mashed potatoes. It was 
mine, and I nearly ate the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, you'll find yourself thinning the mash with milk and making it a 
beautiful soup. When you feel adventurous, you can beat eggs into the mash and 
bake it into a fluffy pudding. James Beard liked to marbleize a buttery paste 
of sauteed finely chopped mushrooms through mashed rutabagas. In "The New James 
Beard," the dean of American cookery calls them "yellow turnips" and says, "You 
might think the strong peppery taste of the turnips would wipe out the delicate 
mushroom quality but, oddly enough, they meet on equal ground." See? This is a 
vegetable for elevated palates.  
</P>
<P>
 You most certainly will see when you grow them and the tall blue-green leaves 
rustle in the autumn breeze. Rutabagas give good return for their space in the 
garden. The roots are a healthy source of potassium -- close to that of a 
banana, with more Vitamin C and fewer calories. And something you don't get 
with store-bought rutabagas are those beautiful leaves. Cook them as you would 
turnip greens, adding a dribble of olive oil and vinegar. Great with chops.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost any recipe for potatoes, turnips, carrots, winter squash or pumpkin may 
be applied to rutabagas. Don't forget to roast some crescent-shaped slices in 
the dish with your chicken. For maximum nourishment, cook rutabagas unpeeled. 
Smallish home-grown roots needn't be peeled at all. But if the root has been 
preserved with paraffin, remove the coating with a sharp knife, quartering the 
globe first. If you want to peel rutabagas for company, use a vegetable peeler 
and remove the thinnest possible layer. 
</P>
<P>
 I was reading the other day about corn oysters. Years ago when someone thought 
to make fritters out of oysters, someone else reasoned that oysters were rare, 
corn was plentiful, and the silvery taste of corn (with a stretch of the 
imagination) resembled the flavor of silvery mollusks from the deep. Oysters of 
corn proved to be downright delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 I had rutabagas in the back of my mind as I was reading and I thought, why not 
oysters of rutabaga too? They're delectable. The spicy, bite-size puffs of 
golden shreds are quickly made -- a lightly sweet, slightly crunchy 
accompaniment to hot or cold roast meat. The difference between fritters then 
and now is that mine cook in little fat. Good thing, because I eat more than my 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 My rutabaga-growing friends are still bringing sweet roots into the kitchen 
from winter storage. If you have a place that's just above freezing, with 90% 
to 95% humidity, your rutabagas will keep on a shelf for six months. If not, 
sink them in a bucket of moist sand (with drainage holes) and keep as cold as 
possible. A Yankee neighbor coats his rutabagas with melted paraffin. The roots 
can even be left in the ground over winter, but usually their quality suffers. 
It's best to lift them. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also dry thin slices of rutabagas. They're lovely tossed into a soup 
or stew, soaking up broth or gravy to swell their cells. The directions are too 
detailed to give here -- your local library should have a book on drying 
vegetables. If there's no entry for rutabagas, follow the rule for carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is important when sowing these roots, since they're a cool-season crop 
and will turn tough in hot weather. So bear in mind that the roots are ready to 
be pulled in about three months.  
</P>
<P>
 Where summers are coolish, you can sow seeds the middle of June for eating 
fresh in mid-September. Where summers are hot, sow no sooner than July for 
harvest in autumn. If you live where there's frost, the roots will be sweetened 
by a frost or two, so count a week or two after your first expected frost date, 
then mark your calendar to sow rutabagas three months before. Rutabagas are 
very hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 For best germination in hot weather, soak the seeds overnight, then after 
sowing, cover the patch with burlap or cheesecloth and keep it damp until the 
seeds sprout. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil that grows good lettuce and onions will grow good rutabagas. It should be 
a fine tilth -- no rocks -- well drained, and rich in potash. It mustn't be too 
acid (pH about 6 -- a soil test kit will tell you about this). And rutabagas 
want potassium and phosphorus. Especially if you have clay soil, dig in a veil 
of wood ash or agricultural limestone from the nursery, bone meal and as much 
thoroughly rotted organic matter as you can afford. But not too much 
nitrogenous stuff such as manure -- that makes root crops hairy and causes them 
to split. For mildness, keep the soil moist -- in dry soil, rutabagas get hot.  
</P>
<P>
 The reason rutabagas are more pigmented on the top half is because they grow 
half out of the earth. They're rather endearing in the border. Mingle Lemon 
Yellow marigolds among them -- the flowers are edible. Give them about eight 
hours of sun each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalogues may tell you the roots will get eight inches wide. Never! Four 
inches is max. Just grow more of them if you want more to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutabagas belong to the brassica or cole family, whose chief members are 
cabbages. This is an ancient bunch, and probably because it has been on this 
planet so long, it has its fan club of pests. To avoid trouble, rotate 
rutabagas through your garden, not returning them to the same place for four 
years. (Still, rutabagas are less bothered by disease than turnips.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you have flea beetles, cover the seedlings with floating row cover 
(available at large garden supply stores). Keep an eye out for slugs. If your 
soil is plagued by club root, sow the cultivar Marian. Otherwise, the rutabaga 
of choice these days seems to be one of the American Purple Tops. There are a 
number of strains. All have sweet, fine-grained flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 In other places, rutabagas are called Swedish turnips, or Swedes for short. 
That's because the Swedes grow a lot a rutabagas. Swedes is a less amusing 
name. But on the other hand, what would we think if a vegetable was called 
Americans?

<P>
 -- FAITH, BEVERLY and TOBY 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR FAITH, ET AL: Jennifer Jasinki, the cafe chef at Spago, sent us a 
quantity-size recipe, which we broke down to home-size. However, be warned that 
there may be some changes in texture and taste as a result. Even so, it's a 
good recipe. Cooks should note that this style of meatloaf is closer to a pate 
than a traditional loaf would be. SPAGO MEATLOAF

</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon minced shallots 
</P>
<P>

 DEAR SOS: Do you have a recipe for thick Sicilian pizza? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANTHONY 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR ANTHONY: This is a recipe for thick pizza dough that can be used for 
Sicilian-style pie. Add the toppings of your choice, such as tomato sauce, 
cheese, anchovies, sausage, vegetables or dried tomatoes. PIZZA DOUGH FOR 
SICILIAN-STYLE PIZZA 
</P>
<P>
 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 packages dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water

</P>
<P>
 In bowl mix 2 cups flour and yeast. In medium saucepan, combine milk, water, 
sugar, oil and salt. Stir over low heat until warm. Add liquid to flour mixture 
and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes on medium speed of mixer. Add 1 cup 
flour and beat 1 minute. Stir in more flour to make moderately stiff dough.  
</P>
<P>
 Turn onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny, 10 to 12 
minutes. Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning dough to 
grease all sides. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch 
down. 
</P>
<P>

fit 13-inch pizza pan. Add tomato sauce and toppings of choice. Makes 4 
(13-inch) or 16 small pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 Each small pizza, without topping, contains about:

THE $50,000 BONBON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA, TIMES FOOD EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something goofy is going on at the Hotel del Coronado, because right there at 
the entrance of the Crown Room -- the elegant dining room where the Duke of 
Windsor was introduced to Wallis Simpson, where L. Frank Baum dreamed up much 
of the "Wizard of Oz" -- stands a walking, waving, button-eyed Doughboy. Next 
to him is a green-skinned sprite named Sprout, apparently the preferred 
spokesboy of the Green Giant company, which is now part of Pillsbury, where 
chipper is better than jolly and gigantic. 
</P>
<P>
 It's barely past 6:30 in the morning, too early for cartoon mascots. But the 
breakfast crowd gathered under the crown-shaped chandeliers for the 36th 
Pillsbury Bake-Off is wide awake. The coffee and adrenaline flow freely, and a 
Dixieland jazz band pumps the mood even a notch higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Game-show and Bake-Off host Alex Trebek shows up toward the end of breakfast, 
after the 100 contest finalists have received pep talks from Pillsbury's top 
executives, and he seems to be the only one affected by the early hour. Later 
he will walk through the contest hall, face powdered and expensively 
sweater-dressed, like a good TV personality, but at the moment he is appearing 
as America rarely sees him -- without makeup. No one seems to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God, it's Alex," says a finalist to her husband, at first embarrassed 
to be overheard. "Well, he's just so smart and handsome." In real life, Trebek 
seems destined to play the role he was given in Robert Altman's "Shortcuts" -- 
a celebrity to be ogled from afar -- every time he steps into public view. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just one last order of business before the contestants make the grand 
march into the Bake-Off hall. Everyone stands, the band begins to play and the 
crowd sings "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, doesn't that feel better?" says Rob Hawthorne, Pillsbury's chief 
operating officer. "I love tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to cry," the Trebek fan says. "I mean, this whole thing, 
it's an American tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Pillsbury Bake-Off, in 1949, was devised, company representatives 
say, as a way to lure women back into the kitchen after they'd had a taste of 
the working life during World War II. Just as the science of home economics, a 
few decades earlier, made housewives feel they had a profession, not simply a 
list of daily chores, the Bake-Off was meant to bring glamour, patriotism -- 
and big money -- to America's home bakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman seldom bakes a cake, a pie, or a batch of cookies for herself," wrote 
Ann Pillsbury, then director of Pillsbury's Home Service, in the contest recipe 
booklet published just after the 1951 Bake-Off (called the Grand National at 
the time). "But through the foods she bakes, she expresses her thoughtfulness 
and love to her family, her friends or her church." 
</P>
<P>
 Art Linkletter was the celebrity host that year, and first prize, $25,000, 
went to Mrs. Samuel P. Weston of La Jolla and her Starlight Double-Delight 
Cake. Women were listed by their husband's names through 1976, when Mrs. Bert 
Groves and Mrs. Edward F. Smith co-won the grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the people at Pillsbury look sheepish when they admit the 
contest's early intentions. But they are quick to point out that today's 100 
finalists are a diverse lot. "They are 'doers,' " says this year's Bake-Off 
program, "with successful careers, who also enjoy a variety of leisure and 
volunteer activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the last couple of Bake-Offs, Pillsbury went out of its way to attract 
cooks of all ethnic groups. Some entry forms were printed in Spanish. Others 
were published in places where Asians, African Americans and other ethnic cooks 
would find them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the majority of the finalists are female and white -- this year there 
are eight men. But only 21 of the women consider themselves full-time 
homemakers. And there are a lot more savory recipes in the contest these days 
-- mostly due to corporate expansion. With Green Giant in the Pillsbury family, 
things like frozen and canned vegetable products made it onto the list of 
required ingredients. (Each recipe must include at least one Pillsbury product, 
say, the Refrigerated All Ready Pizza Crust or Ready to Spread Frosting 
Supreme.) 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to make fun of all this corporate corn. But as the finalists 
suit up in their royal-blue aprons and get their final instructions ("You'll 
walk in twos. Meet your partner in the hall where the Sprout and Doughboy are 
standing -- then proceed to your ranges"), it's hard not to get caught up in 
their excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the hotel's Grande Hall, stern-faced Pinkerton guards ensure that only 
badged guests are allowed into the viewing area. A Pillsbury coordinator 
exchanges nervous small talk with the Sprout, only to be interrupted by one of 
the guards: "Could you step back? We need to get the Doughboy on camera." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, to the sounds of march music and rhythmically clapping hands, the 
contestants enter the hall, just behind George and Sarah Pillsbury, the grand 
marshals of this "parade." (Their role is largely symbolic. Pillsbury is now 
owned by the British corporation Grand Metropolitan PLC, but CEO Paul Walsh 
knows the value of keeping the family involved in the Bake-Off.) 
</P>
<P>
 The first contestants in the hall are bouncy, all smiles, and they wave 
enthusiastically to the Pillsburys and to the cameras. As more finalists stream 
in, the waves grow limper; some don't bother to wave at all, so intent and 
nervous are they to get to their ranges. A man stands out of camera-shot, 
frantically waving to the contestants, reminding them to look perky, not 
panicked.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the finalists have been through this before; the Bake-Off attracts a 
lot of cooking-contest regulars, though the rules have been changed so that 
cooks can be finalists only three times.  
</P>
<P>
 A woman's voice on the loudspeaker can barely be heard over the noise, but the 
contestants seem to hear her: "Please go to your kitchens. Bake-Off 36 is under 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Each station is equipped with an electric range from Sears, a pitcher of ice 
water and a mauve banquet chair, possibly for emergency rest breaks. A few 
ingredients are out in view -- margarine for Number 11, Betty Chromzack; 
butter, eggs and cream cheese for Number 6, Rebecca Moe -- but most are put 
away in the Sears-provided cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there's a lot of opening of cabinets and checking of equipment. 
Suddenly an aproned woman runs out of the hall. "I put too much lotion on my 
hands!" she shouts out to her family gathered in the observing area. "My hands 
are too slick to bake!" She's off in search of a ladies room.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes after the contest is officially under way, the press and 
corporate guests are allowed to roam the ranges and pepper the finalists with 
questions. But the families and friends must stay behind the rope -- "for 
security reasons," one woman explains. "I guess they think we're going to give 
them a secret ingredient or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Already there are media favorites, the cooks with the stories and perky good 
looks that attract press attention. There are the Wittans -- Joan and Susan and 
their mother Mildred. Each is a finalist and the camera loves them. Joan's 
husband, Mark, has been a finalist in the past. And most of the Wittans are 
here in Coronado for a reunion -- the family that bakes-off together . . . 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Wayne Hu, at age 77 proud to be this year's oldest contestant. 
He's making Chinese Roast Pork Buns out of Pillsbury Refrigerated Buttermilk 
Biscuits. He came to the U.S. in the '40s from Shanghai. "Food is what you miss 
the most, more than friends," he says. He does the Chinese cooking in the 
family. "My wife cooks American food."  
</P>
<P>
 Tasha Marie Sullivan, at range Number 1, gets a lot of camera attention, 
mostly because her daughter is strapped into a mommy pouch across her chest. 
Sullivan's child care fell through at the last minute, so she keeps a close 
watch on little Aina as she works on her potato-and-corn empanadas, dubbed 
Cheesy Potato 'n' Corn Empanadas for the contest. Catchy, cutesy names are 
important to Pillsbury. The guiding philosophy: Why say and when you can say 
'n' ? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the reporters call 28-year-old Alex De Santis the Tom Cruise of the 
Bake-Off -- he prepares his Chicken, Bean and Barley Stew from start to finish 
behind dark wraparound sunglasses and talks of blowing any possible winnings in 
Vegas after the contest. As many women have noted, he's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Six hours are allotted for the Bake-Off -- the finalists make three versions 
of their entries (one for judging, one for photos and one for sampling), but 
the time goes quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 By 12:30, with just an hour and a half left before time is up, panic starts to 
set in. No one has ever not finished at the Bake-Off, but there are problems. A 
record number of Band-Aids have been handed out -- so many they've lost count 
at the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a reporter from the Washington Post discovers that some of the Sears 
refrigerators aren't cold enough to chill the non-bake pies in the contest. 
Kenmore-gate? Gabby technicians are hustled away from the press and an official 
explanation is given: So many cakes and pies needed chilling this year that the 
doors were constantly being opened and closed -- there's no problem with the 
equipment itself. The Post reporter looks doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 As 2 o'clock nears, Kristen Crowley at Range 18 struggles with her Toffee 
Mocha Pie (a refrigerator pie) alongside Eileen Long at Range 19, who has had 
trouble all morning adjusting the oven temperature for her Mai Mai Sweet Potato 
Pie. Over at Range 97, Shirley Tompkins hustles through the final slicing and 
arranging of her Braided Yam Coffee Cake for the judges. At 1:55 p.m., Long, 
the last finalist, is off the floor. The Pillsbury people look relieved -- a 
perfect record preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, still stuffed after a private dinner show at Sea World -- "I 
feel like one of those dolphins who automatically opens his mouth whenever 
someone snaps a finger," says one finalist -- everyone gathers in the hotel 
ballroom for the announcement of the winner. The proceedings, hosted by Trebek, 
are taped for broadcast later that morning on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 After the usual preliminaries, during which Trebek manages to work in the word 
"jeopardy" three or four times, six $10,000-category winners are called to the 
stage, which is designed like a homey kitchen, complete with refrigerator 
magnets and Pillsbury products. Two of the women well up with tears when their 
names are called, and they hold hands tightly as they sit on stools placed 
around a kitchen island. It's just like the end of a beauty contest. One of 
them will be the $50,000 grand-prize winner.  
</P>
<P>
 A silver-cloched tray is brought out to the counter. Underneath is the winning 
entry. Trebek takes his time building up the tension, and then the cloche is 
lifted, the name is announced.  
</P>
<P>
 It's Mary Anne Tyndall of Whiteville, N.C. Her recipe: Fudgy Bonbons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet and gooey wins again.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: ELMS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CAN'T WE ALL GET ALONG? Once again, tension between classes has spilled into 
the streets for all to see -- and this time it's in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a case of the very rich versus the sort-of rich. 
</P>
<P>
 The root of the problem is the pruning of city-owned trees. The elms are on 
Via Media, and the folks there love them. But the elms are about to be shorn to 
satisfy the even richer residents on Via Almar, who say the elms block their 
views of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Via Almar folks pay the city $65 to trim each tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides say their property values depend upon proper management of the 
elms. The Via Almar residents say their property is worth less if the elms get 
too tall. Via Media residents say they will suffer financial loss if the elms, 
which once met in a leafy canopy over their street, get shorn to nubs and 
eventually die. How to solve the matter? Committees have met and guidelines 
have been developed, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 The sort-of-rich folks who love the elms still think they are getting the 
short end of the stick again this year, since the city's annual tree-trimming 
project begins next week.

 SMALL WORLD: In the Chadwick School's Good Neighbor Series, the neighbor this 
time is not just down the block. In fact, it's across the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The school on South Academy Drive on the Palos Verdes Peninsula is presenting 
an evening of Indian cinema with a special emphasis on the films of 
Oscar-winning director Satyajit Ray. Cinema is the most popular form of mass 
entertainment in India, which is the largest producer of films in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, who died in 1992, apparently did everything but sell theater tickets. He 
not only produced 30 films and 10 documentaries, but wrote the screenplays, 
composed the music, ran the camera and often edited the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the evening is $6 per person and will include a sampling of Indian 
food.

 DOWN TO THE WIRE: Torrance's City Council candidates have been cordial on the 
campaign trail so far, but behind the scenes, they have a few gripes. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Jack Messerlian put out a mailer that features a photo of him with 
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert when she presented him with a Community Service 
Award. Some candidates, however, say it implies he got her endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a proprietary picture," Messerlian said. "It was taken at a public 
meeting. And in no way does it say that she gave me her endorsement. I don't 
know why people are so uptight about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Geissert, who endorsed Marcia Cribbs and Steve Whitehead, said that she would 
"have preferred to have been asked" about the photo. But her feathers weren't 
too ruffled: "It's hard to get mad at Jack Messerlian." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 IN PRINT: Candidate Steve Whitehead, meanwhile, has become the envy of some of

WESTSIDE WATCH; THE BAY STREET ROLLERS AIM FOR THE 2012 OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tip over trash cans in a barren Santa Monica Beach parking lot, throw in a few 
Eastern transplants, Canadians and Gretzky wanna-bes wearing in-line skates and 
carrying sticks, a rubber ball, and, voila , California has yet another new 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Roller hockey is the latest craze to hit Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On most weekends, roller hockey enthusiasts gather in a lot at the western 
edge of Bay Street in Santa Monica, attracted by sunshine and fierce 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheap and it's free," said Adam Stepan, a roller hockey devotee 
originally from New York City. "I love playing and going to the beach -- it's 
the perfect combination." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport grew with the advent of in-line skates and the rising popularity of 
the Los Angeles Kings. Ready availability of equipment -- such as shinguards, 
gloves and kneepads -- helped too. 
</P>
<P>
 On some evenings, enthusiasts show their skills in four or five games played 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be an Olympic sport by 2012," Stepan said. "We've even got a few 
hard-core groupies but could always use more."

 MELROSE 90069: To some television viewers, "Melrose Place" is Fox 
Broadcasting's must-see Wednesday evening soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 But Melrose Place is also a two-block Westside street between La Cienega 
Boulevard and Melrose Avenue. Many of its businesses are upscale antique stores 
that have been on the street for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a merger of reality and fantasy that has chagrined shopkeepers and 
amazed Darren Star, the show's creator and executive producer, fans of the show 
have been flocking to the street since the series began in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 John Corwin, who manages Connoisseur Antiques, has had to send away many 
disappointed fans who believed the apartment building that serves as the show's 
focal point is located on the street. (In reality, it is in a sound stage in 
Santa Clarita.) They also pepper him with questions about the locations of the 
various clubs shown on the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Corwin's solution is to refer the fans to Melrose Avenue, a popular site for 
filming movies, television shows and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 To Toshi Kihara, the owner of Melrose Place, a restaurant at the street's west 
end, having a business on a street with the same name as a popular television 
show is "not really a happy thing." (Kihara said he began making plans for the 
restaurant around January, 1992, and opened that September). 
</P>
<P>
 Kihara reports that young people wearing tank tops and shorts have come in 
seeking hamburgers and milkshakes. That's not exactly the fare or the dress 
code for the California cuisine restaurant, which shoots for the older Beverly 
Hills crowd, Kihara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first year, it was very hard because of the show," Kihara said. 
"Customers told me they didn't come here (earlier) because they thought Melrose 
Place had something to do with the show." But since then, the restaurant has 
been building a regular clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Star said he dubbed the series "Melrose Place" because the name "just had a 
ring to it" and he wanted the series to be identified with Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was certainly aware there was a street called Melrose Place, but I figured 
hardly anyone in L.A. knew that, so I wasn't worried about the rest of the 
country," Star said.

 UNDER PARADISE: To some, Santa Monica is paradise, either because of its 
climate, beach or a city government still hewing to liberal policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city figures prominently in "Escape From Paradise," a one-woman play at 
New York City's Circle Repertory Theatre through March 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the characters portrayed by Regina Taylor is Sister Sinclair, a 
soothsayer living under the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play is about why we are all on the road searching for that thing called 
paradise (and) what that is for different people," said Taylor, who wrote the 
play. She is best known for her Emmy-nominated and Golden Globe-winning role as 
Lilly Harper in "I'll Fly Away," a television series set in the South at the 
beginning of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plot out on this course," Taylor said, "and we get out on the road and 
once we get to that destination, we find that paradise is very mercurial and 
hard to hold on to." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said that Sister Sinclair is "trying to gather followers to her belief 
of what paradise is." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a blind woman, but she can see everything," Taylor said. "She sees the 
good, the bad, the indifferent and all the shades in between. At one point she 
got tired at looking around at all the misery and strife in the world, asked 
the Lord what to do and takes out her eyes. In doing that, she saw the light. 
In essence, Sister Sinclair took out her eyes so she can see paradise without 
any distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a former Santa Monica resident, said the character is not based on a 
real person.

QUAKE PUTS DENT IN RENT CONTROL; HOUSING: HUNDREDS OF UNITS MAY RETURN TO 
MARKET LEVEL AS REBUILDING COSTS ARE PASSED ON TO TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council and the Rent Board this week set earthquake 
rebuilding policies that could result in the loss of hundreds of 
rent-controlled units and raise rents in hundreds more to market level. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint session Tuesday that drew a large crowd to City Hall, officials 
from the two bodies reluctantly signed off on the rules, which are subject to 
final council approval by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, we have to do it," Rent Board member Suzanne Abrescia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrescia was responding to a disgruntled tenant who complained about the 
policies at a joint meeting of the council and Rent Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "To permit this pass-through (of repair costs to tenants) is to change for all 
time the face and character of Santa Monica," said the tenant, Sylvia Schniad. 
</P>
<P>
 But landlords had their own tales of woe. Mary Tabatabai, who owns an 
eight-unit building, said she has a $400,000 mortgage and needs $500,000 worth 
of repairs, which she can't afford. She said her building -- where she lived 
until the earthquake damaged it -- didn't withstand the quake because strict 
rent control made it impossible for her to adequately maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't afford to repair the building," she said. "My family is homeless. 
Everything is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In setting the policies, the council and rent board acknowledged that the face 
of Santa Monica has already been changed by the Northridge earthquake, which 
heavily damaged the city's older housing and commercial structures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a vote that would have been unheard of before Jan. 17, the council agreed 
to allow both residential and commercial buildings to be restored to their 
pre-earthquake size and use -- even though current zoning standards are much 
more restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 That means a seven-story commercial building destroyed by the quake could be 
put right back up, though others could only build a two-story building in the 
same area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would the rebuilt structures be subject to current parking standards, a 
major concession, recognizing that older buildings, both commercial and 
residential, lack adequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Abdo said parking is a hard issue, but she did not want to 
overburden already beleaguered property owners. "There are going to be enough 
barriers for these owners to get their buildings on line." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest of these barriers is getting financing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no easy answers that lenders are going to be stepping right up and 
lending money," said Suzanne Frick, the city's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the business community and landlords said financing would 
be hard to come by, particularly for multifamily housing. They say reasons for 
this include city requirements that 30% of units in new condominiums be 
affordable units and that only earthquake-related repair costs be passed on to 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, earthquake repair would not include the installation of 
much-needed new plumbing and other hardware that would be most easily done 
during the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lender we met with was concerned about only allowing earthquake-related 
damage (costs) to be passed through," said Rent Board administrator Mary Ann 
Yurkonis. Lenders, she said, want plumbing and other systems upgraded to 
enhance the value of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Paul Rosenstein, though he voted for the policies, said he was 
uneasy that they were not accompanied by a financial analysis of their impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel we're flying in the dark, and these proposals won't be 
adequate," Rosenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said Tuesday's action represented a much-needed first step 
toward reconstruction. Most property owners, they point out, have been doing 
nothing because they do not know what the city's final rebuilding rules are. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 392 red- and yellow-tagged residential buildings in the city, 
representing 1,900 apartment units, 200 condominiums and 41 single-family 
homes.

REDONDO COUNCIL REJECTS CONDO-COMMERCIAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal for a $40-million development combining condominiums, a health 
club, restaurants and retail shops was killed by the Redondo Beach City Council 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners were enthusiastic about the 163-condominium project because it 
would have allowed residents to shop and work close to home while giving 
retailers a built-in customer base. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members, who defeated the project 3 to 2, said they feared the 
development would bring more traffic to the area around Pacific Coast Highway 
and Vista del Parque and hurt nearby merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This situation is going to create even more of a nightmare (for parking)", 
said Councilman Stevan Colin, who joined Joseph Dawidziak and Robert Pinzler in 
defeating the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members Greg Hill and Marilyn White supported the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, proposed by Bidamar Corp. of Glendale, would have been the first 
of its kind in Redondo Beach. It would have contained 37,000 square feet of 
retail shops, including a dry cleaner, a shoe repair shop, a bookstore, a 
coffee shop and a flower shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidamar is purchasing the 4.7-acre site at 1840 S. Pacific Coast Highway from 
Peyton Cramer Ford. The car dealership plans to move, possibly to Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidamar had dubbed the project "The Campanile" for the Mediterranean-style 
bell tower that would have served as its central landmark. The design by the 
Santa Monica architectural firm Johannes Van Tilburg includes colorful awnings, 
cobbled streets and wrought-iron balconies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission unanimously approved the project in August, but the 
decision was appealed to the council by area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy democracy exists," said Delia Vechi, a 20-year resident of the 
city who opposed the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Bidamar representatives said they had bent over backward to please city 
planners and neighbors. The company agreed to install a traffic signal on 
Pacific Coast Highway and add a right lane at the intersection of Palos Verdes 
Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway. In addition, they agreed to install 80 
more parking spaces than the city required. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, company representatives have had 40 meetings with area residents, 
said Brooks Roddan, a spokesman for Bidamar. The proposal was scaled back from 
203 condominiums to 163. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here is a property rights crisis," Roddan said. The company is 
considering several options. Roddan did not rule out a lawsuit against the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the company's efforts, many residents still weren't satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't step out onto the street without getting run over," said George 
Patris, 66, a lifelong resident of Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 163 condominiums would have ranged in size from 1,000 square feet for a 
one-bedroom to 1,800 square feet for three bedrooms, a den and a loft.

JUDGE UPHOLDS BAN ON DEVELOPMENT IN MALIBU'S CIVIC CENTER AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Settling one of the most contentious land-use issues since Malibu was 
incorporated in 1991, a Superior Court judge has upheld the city's interim 
zoning ordinance, a ruling that stalls the development of a 125-acre parcel of 
land in the civic center area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu Village Civic Assn., a group of 15 civic center landholders who had 
sued the city to clear the way for the mixed-use residential and commercial 
project, plans to appeal or ask Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne to 
reconsider her decision, which was made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling halts plans for what has been considered one of Southern 
California's most ambitious coastal development projects in years. It would 
transform Malibu's largely undeveloped civic center area, north of Pacific 
Coast Highway between Cross Creek and Stuart Ranch roads, into a mix of 
bungalows, estate homes, apartments and condominiums for up to 1,500 people, 
interspersed with shops and offices built around a village green. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in April by the landholders group, which includes the 
largest commercial landholders in Malibu: the Konheim and Perenchio families of 
the Malibu Bay Co. The suit asked the court to overturn the zoning ordinance on 
the ground that it does not comply with the state Environmental Quality Act. 
The act requires cities to conduct an environmental impact report before a 
development project or land-use ordinances are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance outlaws residential development in the civic center, prohibits 
new multifamily housing in the city and places strict limits on other kinds of 
development. The ordinance was adopted in February, 1993, after a two-year 
building moratorium expired. It is a temporary measure while the city completes 
its General Plan, due in November.  
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asserted that the city violated state environmental laws in 
numerous technical ways, among them by adopting the ordinance without preparing 
an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony of the lawsuit is that the developer is trying to use an 
environmental act against an environmental City Council," said Deputy City 
Atty. Christi Hogin. "(The State Environmental Quality Act) has been 
interpreted by the court to include adoption of an ordinance. And like a 
(development) project, the act requires that you do a study to determine that 
there will be no adverse effects on the environment. We did a study." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern that the interim ordinance might be included in the city's General 
Plan prompted the lawsuit, which has cost the city about $250,000 and generated 
more than 60,000 pages of documents, Hogin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at all the (legal) options," said the landholders' attorney, 
Allan J. Abshez. "(Judge Wayne) basically justified her decision based on the 
fact that the city's zoning law was interim. Our concern is that it represents 
permanent policy direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogin said that, by law, the City Council must review the interim zoning 
ordinance when the General Plan is adopted, and ensure that it is consistent 
with the plan's building ordinances. But, "I don't think that you are going to 
see a radical plan change between the interim zoning ordinance and the General 
Plan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogin added: "I think there will be some differences. This ordinance is very 
conservative, and it was designed that way so as not to prejudice the General 
Plan. Malibu is not interested in wide-scale development. The developers are 
never going to get as much as they want." 
</P>
<P>
 The driving force behind the lawsuit has been the Malibu Bay Co., owner of 
about 125 acres of mostly undeveloped land surrounded by hillsides and ocean. 
The company owns about 74 acres of the civic center land in contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Malibu Bay Co. owns 21 acres on Point Dume and 28 acres in 
Trancas Canyons, areas where building density has been substantially reduced in 
the ordinance, thereby discouraging development. The company is also seeking to 
have those zoning changes nullified. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, one of the plaintiffs, Wave Properties, a subsidiary of 
Pepperdine University and owner of a 16-acre parcel of land in the civic center 
area, withdrew from the suit to avert mounting litigation costs and as a 
conciliatory gesture toward the city.

ELECTIONS; IN TORRANCE MAYORAL RACE, IT BOILS DOWN TO MATTER OF STYLE; 
POLITICS: TUESDAY'S VOTE PITS 'INDEPENDENT' BILL APPLEGATE AGAINST 
'CONSENSUS-BUILDER' DEE HARDISON. CRIME IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance's two mayoral candidates agree on almost all the issues. But when it 
comes to styles, Councilman Bill Applegate and Councilwoman Dee Hardison are 
worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate, owner of a real estate firm, calls himself the "independent, 
common-sense candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison, a program specialist for the Torrance Unified School District, deems 
herself the "consensus-builder," a vital role, she says, in the city's top and 
largely ceremonial post. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a dramatic contrast of personalities," said Mayor Katy Geissert, who is 
completing eight years in the post. "These are two candidates with very 
different styles." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will select a new mayor on Tuesday. They also will choose three new 
City Council members from a field of 11 candidates, and a new city clerk from 
three contenders. City Treasurer Linda Barnett is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime -- this election's biggest issue -- Applegate and Hardison agree that 
the city has to maintain the Police Department's level of funding and, if 
possible, increase the visibility of officers on the streets. Both say the city 
can do more to lure new businesses and make it easier for companies to get 
through government red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates are relying on endorsements from citizens groups and old 
allies to point out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate, who has an extensive business background, says he has the hands-on 
experience necessary to guide the city's budget and lure businesses into town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone's not elected to the job to always give and take," Applegate said. "I 
have demonstrated my ability to accomplish lots of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison, however, says she can get more done by finding agreement among 
council members. "I stand by the notion that you can be independent. But if you 
are only independent, and you can never find three other people to agree with 
you, how can you get the job done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate got a head start in the campaign, declaring more than two years ago 
that he would seek the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison, in the middle of her second term on the council, had not planned to 
run for any elective office again. But in late 1992, she entered the race after 
George Nakano, who was widely expected to run, decided to seek a state Senate 
seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Applegate collected a larger campaign war chest. As of Feb. 19, he had $28,093 
in cash and had spent $37,018 this year. Hardison has $21,625 in cash and has 
spent $21,682 this year. Hardison uses her past campaigns to point out that 
money doesn't guarantee votes. She was the top council vote-getter in 1986 and 
1990 -- ahead of Applegate -- even though she was among the lowest spenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mayor's race, Applegate won the endorsement of the Torrance Police 
Officers Assn., which could prove a windfall because crime has been the most 
discussed topic in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone agrees crime and public safety is an important issue," Applegate 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Other endorsements, however, underscore longstanding rifts between Applegate 
and some other members of the council. Geissert has backed Hardison, along with 
Nakano and Councilmen Mark Wirth and Don Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison's background in civic affairs and strong support from Geissert in 
previous council campaigns have invited comparisons to the mayor. Geissert and 
Hardison were the first and second women elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dee tends to be very cautious in her approach and very thorough," Geissert 
said. Applegate has been more contentious, opposing the council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Applegate was the lone council member to vote against giving City 
Atty. Stanley Remelmeyer a 34% salary increase a year before he stepped down. 
The move, which raised Remelmeyer's salary from $92,724 to $124,548, also 
boosted his pension benefits. In exchange, Remelmeyer agreed to give up 
city-financed health benefits and a car allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he praised Remelmeyer, Applegate called the raise "totally out of 
line and unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hardison said other employee groups have been offered the same 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the only dispute over employee benefits. In 1988, the council -- 
including Applegate -- voted to allow managers to cash out on as many as 36 
days of leave per year. The payments were intended to offset the time managers 
spend attending night meetings and performing other duties. But it added nearly 
$500,000 to the paychecks of top city managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate and Hardison said they never would have approved it had they known 
how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, when the costs surfaced, the council scaled back the program from 36 
to 24 days. It was later cut to eight days. Applegate voted against the action 
both times, saying the council did not trim enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate publicly chastised City Manager LeRoy Jackson for what he called an 
"unexplained failure to communicate" the full cost of the program when it was 
first approved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hardison and Geissert said Jackson did not intentionally mislead the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there needs to be some blame laid," Hardison told the council at the time, 
"I will accept it as one of the five council members that are still on the 
council from that time for maybe not asking enough questions, not going back at 
some point and questioning it." 
</P>
<P>
 He uses it as an example of his ability to go out on a limb when he believes 
it will save the city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get elected to agree with them," Applegate said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hardison, however, rejects the notion that she has sacrificed fiscal 
responsibility to go along with other council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when the city was facing budget cuts, she proposed cutting the 
council's travel pay. After talking with colleagues, she proposed trimming it 
30%. The council unanimously agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't so much the dollars, but it sent a real strong message that we 
ought to make (cuts) personally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the remaining days before the election, both candidates hope to convince 
voters that their style would better serve the city. Each plans to campaign 
door-to-door and to blitz residents with mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mayor, who will be sworn in March 15, will dive immediately into 
drafting a budget for the fiscal year beginning in June -- and will have to 
help guide new council members through the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor will have to take the new three council members and, in effect, 
break them in," said Jim Armstrong, mayor of Torrance from 1978 to 1986. "If 
you can't find three votes, you can just howl in the wilderness."

LETTER BLITZ HALTS PROPOSED BUSINESS LEVY; TAXES: SAN PEDRO MERCHANTS CALLED 
THE YEARLY ASSESSMENTS EXCESSIVE AND UNJUSTIFIED. THE MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
USED TO FINANCE PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a furious letter-writing campaign, more than 200 merchants and property 
owners in downtown San Pedro have blocked a plan to tax their businesses for 
public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed yearly assessments of $100 to $300 had the strong backing of Los 
Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., whose district includes San Pedro. 
Some property owners within the community's central business district also 
supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents, calling the assessments excessive and unjustified, mounted a 
protest that led to letters from 236 of the 419 businesses in the area, 
generally bounded by Harbor Boulevard, Pacific Avenue and 3rd and 10th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter-writing effort forced the city, under state law, to drop the 
assessment plan for at least a year because it was opposed by more than 50% of 
those it would affect. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, it's dead," said Tom Kruesopon, Svorinich's press spokesman. 
The councilman intends to reintroduce the plan next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to establish the business improvement district was initially 
pushed by Svorinich's predecessor, Joan Milke Flores. She had responded to 
requests by some San Pedro businesses that the area be improved with better 
street lighting and other public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan Svorinich embraced after defeating Flores last year, the work 
was to be financed by an annual fee that would be assessed based on the type of 
business in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost from its inception, the plan ran afoul of many business owners who 
not only considered the assessments excessive but their purpose vague. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was sure what is was for," said businessman Nick Papadakis, who helped 
spearhead efforts against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of the confusion, Papadakis said, concerned how much money the 
plan would generate. While supporters said it should raise about $60,000 
annually, the Los Angeles city clerk's official estimate was $95,900, Papadakis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks leading up to a City Hall hearing in January, opponents marshaled 
enough letters of protest to block the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped when we thought we were over the 50% mark," Papadakis said. "Had 
we done an extensive door-to-door campaign, the numbers would have gone up 
dramatically. Definitely." 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's press spokesman said that before reintroducing the proposal next 
year, the councilman hopes to make it more palatable to opponents. For 
instance, Svorinich intends to better explain the purpose of the assessments, 
making clear where and how the funds would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 But to hear Papadakis tell it, the councilman will have a lot of explaining to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good that this has been put on ice because it is another tax 
assessment we do not need. It was poorly conceived, poorly planned, poorly 
presented," Papadakis said. "And if they bring this back, unless they define a 
budget, define an administrative authority, unless they answer all the 
questions that need to be answered, I will continue to oppose it."

CANDIDATES ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN TORRANCE ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the ballot in Torrance's election Tuesday are candidates for mayor, three 
City Council seats, city treasurer and city clerk. Here are candidate 
statements taken from interviews with The Times. CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Botello  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 43 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: El Camino College law and real estate professor 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: The first problem is how we are going to approach the issue of 
safety. We have to do everything we can to replace officers and keep a full 
deployment. Then there is the question of our economic base. How do you have 
the city of Torrance retain the present businesses and attract new businesses? 
We have to tout our safety and go out and reach for those businesses. . . . I 
also think we have to address the issue of true AIDS education for our 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Cribbs  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 58 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Certified public accountant 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: I consider coequal the safety in the neighborhoods, parks and malls 
and the retention and attraction of businesses. With limited financial 
resources we are gong to have to be extremely careful. We cannot afford a 
policeman on every corner. We also need a permanent economic development 
committee to retain and attract businesses. I think we have to do some 
privatization. I am not so dumb as to think that business does everything right 
or government does everything wrong. There are some services that can be done 
better under contract.  
</P>
<P>
 Burton Fletcher  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 43 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Business professor at El Camino College, lawyer 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: I am at the forefront of the push for a major expansion of the 
volunteer reserve (police) officer system. I am the only candidate who is 
advocating council districts for increased council accountability. I am 
advocating that we restrict contributions from special-interest groups. . . . I 
advocate increased citizen participation and oversight in the area of economic 
development by the creation of an economic development commission. . . . I 
believe that the Police Department will better serve our community if an 
advisory police commission provides guidance in such areas as neighborhood 
watch, mall and park safety.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Martinez  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 35 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Business lawyer 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: I want to emphasize the priority of public safety and address the 
rising concern over crime. I would like to see another community lead officer 
added to the program . . . and use the old tried-and-true Neighborhood Watch 
program. I think we could invigorate that. I'm a real proponent of the use of 
volunteers -- not to replace city employees but to supplement them. Another 
area the city has to take a hard look at is airport operations. We have to look 
at raising some of the fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mauno 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 36 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Project manager for financial institution 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: To stem the rate of crime and violence, you need additional citizen 
participation. I'm advocating that the city create the Torrance Public Safety 
Advisory Committee. . . . We need to focus more on preventive action, whatever 
it might be. I'm also advocating a Torrance area youth corps. It is similar to 
the Peace Corps but it's focused on Torrance youth. What I would like to see is 
an individual or department or phone number that a citizen can call to register 
their concern relating to city services.  
</P>
<P>
 Jack Messerlian  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 48 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Urban planner 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: We have got to send a message to criminals that they are just not 
welcome in Torrance. If we need to hire more police offers, then we ought to. 
We've got to come up with a new set of laws to hold parents responsible for 
minors who are involved in graffiti activity. . . . We need to stimulate the 
economic growth of the city. We can attract (jobs) to Torrance by doing one of 
several things. One is to streamline the regulatory process. We've got to 
market the facilities that we have and the quality schools that we have. We 
need to establish a buy-in-Torrance-first program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose (Joe) D. Quinones  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 57 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Air-conditioning and heating technician for the city of Torrance 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: All (the candidates) want the same things: better police and fire 
protection, youth programs and bringing business to Torrance. Why would you 
want to vote for me? The answer is experience. I have the experience of working 
35 years within the system. I know how the city works from the inside. Because 
of the diminishing revenues, the new buzzword is privatization, which is just 
another way of saying contracting out. If the person does not write the 
contract just right, the contractor will not do it. The city was designed and 
formed to perform certain services for its citizens and we do them best. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Rische  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 59 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Retired teacher 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: Public safety is the most important issue. I disapprove of advisory 
commissions. You elect people to take the heat and if you don't like it you 
throw them out of office. Another important issue is economic development and 
jobs and maintaining our quality of life. Another thing we can do is buy in 
Torrance. I have been in the community 37 years. I think I am an independent 
spirit. I don't have a hidden agenda. What you see is what you get.  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Walker  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 53 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Business management and public relations consultant 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: The most important issue is public safety and eliminating crime to 
the greatest possible extent. I want my wife to go shopping or for a walk 
without feeling threatened. (I advocate) taking our police forces back to a 
proactive stance to stop crime before it starts. People elect a city councilman 
to be responsive to their needs; we don't need layer upon layer of government 
(such as a public safety committee). 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Whitehead  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 41 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Dow Chemical executive 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: I feel that safety is the most important thing to myself, residents 
and businesses. . . . City government must operate more like a business. It's 
not a business, but they have to have more of a business approach. With the 
trash business or water services, if the private sector can do it cheaper, they 
should be allowed to. You have to aggressively market this area and bring in 
more high-tech jobs and high-tech businesses. It's always great to have more 
cops, but having more policemen is a way to treat the symptoms. I'd like to 
look more toward the long-term future of this community. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope Witkowsky  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 53 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Marketing and sales 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: The safety of the citizens -- I believe that that is a very 
important thing. I also feel that we need to develop a strategy of bringing 
businesses to Torrance through various incentive programs. I propose to have 
every block in Torrance covered by Neighborhood Watch. Once you get the 
citizens involved again you get that caring and small-town feeling again. There 
are two groups of people that I think we need to buddy together with and do 
some programs. One is the school board and the other is the chamber of 
commerce. . . . Let's educate people to shop here in Torrance so we can pay for 
the services that we need to provide. CITY CLERK Sue Herbers  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 48 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Secretary  
</P>
<P>
 Comments: The most important issue (is) having the right person in the job. I 
am the candidate who has the organizational and administrative skills to come 
in and do the job. It is not a political job. I would like to make the office 
more accessible -- to bring it to the level that people would be able to use. I 
would like to make a series of brochures and cards that explain where people 
should go when they have a problem. I find that a lot of people don't know how 
to use (City Hall). . . . I would like to give the service I would expect if I 
were on the other side of the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Spero  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 28 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: In his official candidate's statement, Spero proposed deleting 
unenforceable ordinances that waste tax dollars. He says he will draft a simple 
index for the Municipal Code so Torrance residents will have easy access to 
laws that govern them. He advocates an open-door policy that welcomes the 
concerns and suggestions of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wirth  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 43 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Councilman, communications technician 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: I view the clerk's office as the access point for the citizens to 
city government. I think it's also important to remember that it's an elected 
post, which guarantees accountability to the citizens. . . . I have those two 
strengths. I understand the importance of accountability because I am an 
elected official and because of my experience with city government I understand 
the importance of the administrative role of the city clerk. The other thing 
I've talked about is campaign finance reform. What I would do is put a number 
of different options before the council and see what they thought about them.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council unanimously approved a plan this week to 
help ease traffic congestion near Palos Verdes Peninsula High School on Silver 
Spur Road. 
</P>
<P>
 After complaints from residents living on nearby Basswood Avenue, city 
officials agreed Tuesday to construct a driveway that will line up with the 
avenue. The city estimates that the project will cost $800,000 and will include 
a sidewalk on Silver Spur Road and a new traffic signal. 
</P>

 Eastbound traffic on Montemalaga Drive will continue to be prohibited from 
turning right onto Basswood Avenue. ANN GRIFFITH

TOPICS / SCULPTURE; FANCY RIDE INTO THE AFTERLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have to meet your maker, why not arrive in style? Why not arrive in 
something that expresses who you really are -- er, were -- rather than a 
run-of-the-mill rectangular box? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind an array of African "fantasy coffins" on display at the 
Ernie Wolfe Gallery in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a fish coffin, a 10-foot lobster coffin, even a Lexus coffin -- all 
hand-carved, upholstered and ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were meant to be buried," gallery owner Ernie Wolfe said recently, 
exhibiting a cheerfulness bordering on the macabre as he strolled among the 
colorful caskets. "They're meant to be seen by the public for a few days. Then, 
as soon as they hit the ground, they're goners." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the public can view the craftsmanship at a more leisurely pace. 
The show opened late last month and is scheduled to end May 1, during which 
time 18 "Afterlife Vehicles" -- including a giant, wood rainbow trout, an ear 
of corn, a shark and a stegosaurus -- will be featured on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
 All are representative of a genre pioneered in the mid-1960s by Kane Kwei, a 
Ghanaian carpenter and sculptor from near the capital city of Accra who carved 
coffins to reflect the achievements and fantasies of the deceased. His first 
effort was for an uncle whose dying wish was that he be buried in something 
beyond the ordinary: Kwei crafted a fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they are fanciful, the coffins are not taken lightly by the families 
who buy them. The sculptures reflect a view of death different from that in the 
West, where one's earthly exit tends to be seen with somber finality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not death," said Wolfe, explaining the Ghanaian philosophy that gave 
rise to the celebratory coffins. "It's just another place, an extension." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by a favorable community response to the fishing boat, Kwei began 
building designer coffins in earnest. He stuck largely to traditional themes 
such as a yellow-fin tuna for fishermen and a sculpture of hen and chicks for 
the mother of a large family. For those with automotive aspirations, he 
assembled car coffins, including an "Edsel." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwei himself died a year-and-a-half ago at the age of 70. (He was interred in 
a modestly engraved box-style coffin). But a handful of former apprentices in 
Ghana, chiefly Paa Willy and Theophilis Nii Anum keep his concept alive, adding 
contemporary flourishes that sometimes make death seem like a Disney adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples of their work include a Batmobile coffin, a Mickey Mouse coffin 
and a massive rendition of Alf, the puppet who starred in his own television 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe, a frequent visitor to Africa and a collector of African art, seems 
thrilled by the new styles, which he sees as evidence of an ever-shrinking 
world. He predicts the coffin makers will push the limits of their craft even 
further as global themes and symbols penetrate Ghanaian society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be coffins done like they've never been done before." he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the afterlife vehicles prove there is no free ride -- even in 
the hereafter. Priced at the gallery from $4,500 to $15,000, the coffins have 
become status symbols for the rich in Ghana, a poor country located on Africa's 
West Coast. In some cases, according to Wolfe, rival families engage in 
one-upmanship over who can afford the fanciest models. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe met Kwei during the late 1980s. But it was not until December that Wolfe 
managed to have the 18 coffins shipped to the United States, a process that 
involved preempting a potentially destructive search by U.S. Customs officials, 
who might have thought the unusual vessels were cleverly packaged contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the wacky caskets could be a smash hit in open-minded Los Angeles, 
but prospective buyers be warned: Wolfe is sizing up the rainbow trout and the 
lobster for himself -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be heartbroken if anyone bought either of those," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HARBOR GATEWAY; TRANSFER OF ROSECRANS DIRECTOR DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to community concerns, Los Angeles parks officials have delayed 
the transfer of a popular park director at Rosecrans Recreation Center. But 
angry neighboring residents said they will continue to fight the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the park at Vermont Avenue and 149th Street have staged 
demonstrations and a letter-writing campaign to fight a decision to move 
director John Willingham to another park in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say Willingham's dedication to the park during his three-year tenure 
turned a one-time gang hangout into a safe haven for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The community campaign to keep Willingham drew the support of Los Angeles 
Councilman Rudy L. Svorinich, who wrote to Recreation and Parks General Manager 
Jackie Tatum requesting that Willingham keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tatum says she needs to use Willingham's skills at another facility. Last 
week, Tatum postponed Willingham's transfer, originally scheduled Feb. 20, for 
three weeks so he can help the community and the new director, Victor Jauregui, 
with the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 But angry residents continue to accuse city parks officials of ignoring the 
community's concerns. The new director is assigned to work only two evening 
shifts per week. Without a director on site every night, as was Willingham's 
practice, the facility will be overrun by gang members again, said resident 
Pamela Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials insist they are committed to improving Rosecrans' programs and 
facilities, and cite budget cutbacks and reduced staff as part of the reason 
for the change in directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jauregui, the new director, promised that even if he isn't at the park each 
night, other parks staff will be on duty. Jauregui said he also plans to add 
programs like exercise, self-defense and dance classes to involve more girls, 
young women and adults in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make this a well-rounded center," he said. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; MOBIL OIL DISPUTES $1.7-MILLION TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has ordered the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance to pay $1.7 
million in fuel taxes, penalties and interest.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mobil spokesman Barry Engelberg said the company should be exempt from the 
tax, and that in reviewing records, the company discovered it is due a refund 
of $860,231 for overpayment of past taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began with an audit of utility taxes paid on natural gas piped 
into the refinery between Jan. 1, 1990, and July 30, 1993. The city hired 
Municipal Resource Consultants in 1992 to review Mobil's records. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the city sent Mobil a notice that it owed $3.9 million, a figure 
that was later revised to $1.2 million. With interest and a 25% penalty, the 
total is now $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Engelberg called the audit "seriously flawed" and said that his company's 
legal department and management would meet to decide what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to assess the tax. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; RAND OPENS MIDEAST STUDIES CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The RAND Corp., internationally famous for its Cold War-era defense analyses, 
has opened a Middle East studies center, hoping to adopt its regional and 
social policy expertise to the pursuit of peace in the war-torn area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The striking aspect of the region is its sheer dysfunctionality, its retarded 
human progress, which poses great risks for the world," said David Gombert, a 
RAND vice president. "We can bring a wide range of talent in resource 
management, labor issues, education and the environment to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 RAND officials said the new center reflects the think tank's move away from 
military issues toward civilian concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to influence individuals and institutions in the Middle East by 
setting up conferences, exchange programs, visiting scholar projects and 
seminars to discuss the area's mutual problems and interests," said Mary 
Morris, associate director of the new center. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND policy analysts met Tuesday with a large group of influential Jewish, 
Arab, Turkish and Iranian Americans after a Jewish settler's massacre of 48 
Muslims in Hebron last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The round-table discussion centered on suggested solutions to the region's 
myriad problems, including a poor economy and political instability. 
</P>
<P>
 "For any growth, the area needs political stability before any investment can 
take place," said Talat Othman, president of Dearforn Financial. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Joe Jacobs, president of Jacobs Engineering Group and a 
self-proclaimed scarred business veteran of the Middle East, said economic 
cooperation remains the best antidote to political passions. 
</P>
<P>
 "An economic model must be set up despite the region's political problems," he 
said. "A concrete economic prize held up at the end of the peace process with 
defined objectives will be a force compelling a political solution. The 
political and economic elements are not mutually exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts encouraged the center to study the broader issues of the Middle 
East and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ignore Algeria and Afghanistan -- the effort should not be just Arabs 
and Israelis," said Jerrold Green, director of the University of Arizona's 
Center for Middle Eastern Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe RAND could be a powerful force because it is the world's largest 
nonprofit organization, with more than 1,100 consultants and research analysts, 
and with decades of experience studying public policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better economic models and education projects will weave a tapestry of peace 
through the Middle East," said Irving Boren, president of the Boren Foundation, 
which recently donated $1 million to the center. "An impartial group like RAND 
will make such programs readily acceptable." ADRIAN MAHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; FIRM UPGRADES PARK IN LIEU OF $8,000 FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carson Little Leaguers won't be wading through weeds and scrambling over a 
bumpy outfield thanks to a deal that allowed a Wilmington firm to do community 
service rather than pay an $8,000 traffic fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department cited Stan-Dur Steel Products in October for 
operating an overweight vehicle without a permit.When attorneys for Stan-Dur 
appeared in court, they asked the judge for leniency when imposing the fine on 
the family-run equipment rental company, said Dan Jeffries of the Los Angeles 
city attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Keith Schwartz agreed to let the company 
clean up the Freeway Little League Field instead of paying the fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really common for individuals to do community service for their fine. 
It's rare -- but not without precedent -- for a company," Jeffries said.  
</P>
<P>
 For the last eight years about 200 Freeway Little League players have chased 
pop flies and slid across the hard packed dirt on a piece of privately owned 
land near Main Street and Del Amo Boulevard, said league President Phil Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Esperanto, Stan-Dur's chief of operations, knew about the rough field 
conditions because his son plays Little League. Even before the company was 
fined, Esperanto had offered a low bid to renovate the field, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-February, Stan-Dur employees have been grading, seeding, planting 
and sprucing up the field, Evans said. They also gave the league $2,000 to 
purchase equipment and uniforms. The project is scheduled to be completed 
before the league's opening day March 26. MARY GUTHRIE

OFFICERS ADOPT SCHOOLS TO FOSTER BETTER TRAFFIC SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each of the elementary and junior high schools within the Gardena city limits 
now has a police officer assigned to the campus to help with traffic flow 
around the school and other safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardena Police Department this week launched its "Adopt-A-School" program, 
which pairs a police officer with each of the six elementary schools -- 
Amestoy, Chapman, Denker Avenue, Purche Avenue, 153rd Street and 156th Street 
-- and with Peary Middle School.The officers will work closely with their 
adopted schools to help improve traffic conditions and pedestrian safety during 
the busy morning and afternoon periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers will provide equipment such as signs and a mobile radar unit, which 
posts the speeds of passing cars, for streets near the schools. The officers 
will write tickets when necessary, but police officials said the focus is on 
educating, not punishing, parents to ease the automobile congestion many 
schools experience when children are dropped off and picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 The six traffic officers and one patrol officer in the program also will serve 
as each school's police contact for crimes such as graffiti and truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to provide each school with a human being" to help with traffic and 
crime issues, said Police Chief Richard Propster. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic Sgt. John Browning conceived the program after realizing his officers 
were responding often to the schools to deal with traffic and parking problems. 
"We weren't proactive; we were reactive," Browning said. "And with all the 
other 'Adopt-A . . . ' programs, I thought, 'Why don't we have an officer 
assigned to each school?' " IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; SPREAD PUBLIC HOUSING AROUND, SVORINICH SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling for an end to "the inequitable distribution of public housing" in Los 
Angeles, Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. is asking the City Council to consider a 
motion that would require other council districts to develop more low-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion calls for the city's Planning Department to submit a report 
outlining each district's share of public housing, and recommends that the 
Housing Authority "limit the development of public housing to communities that 
have not fully contributed to their 'fair share.'" 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's motion came just days before families began moving into a new 
nine-unit public housing development in his 15th District, which includes Watts 
and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 65% of the city's public housing units are in the 15th and 14th 
districts that includes Boyle Heights, El Serano, Highland Park and Eagle Rock, 
while Districts 2 and 11 that include parts of the Valley and West Los Angeles 
have less than 1%, according to Svorinich's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an overprofileration of public housing in certain areas of the city 
that have contributed to deterioration along with the issues such as lack of 
schools, city services and economic infrastructure to support these public 
housing developments," Svorinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's motion would allow the council to provide funding to help purchase 
land in cases where the high cost of the property could be an obstacle to 
developing public housing. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

CITY HALL NEWS: GARDENA; NEARBY RESIDENTS WANT SWAP MEET CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Repeating decades-old complaints, residents near the Vermont Drive-In begged 
the Gardena Planning and Environmental Quality Commission this week to shut it 
down, saying noise and traffic from its weekend swap meet have made life 
unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 At a continuation of a public hearing begun in January, about 25 residents of 
182nd and Rumbold streets and Vermont Avenue filed into the council chambers 
Tuesday night to complain of traffic congestion, automobile and early morning 
vendor noise, and swap meet patrons who litter and urinate on residents' lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they can't enjoy leisurely weekends or allow their children to 
play outside because of the many swap meet patrons who traipse through their 
neighborhoods every Saturday and Sunday. Some residents said they haven't been 
able to sell their homes because of proximity to the swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the complaints concern the 25-year-old, 800-vendor swap meet, 
open from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, residents also complained of 
honking horns and traffic noise from weeknight movie customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the 50-year-old drive-in at 17737 S. Vermont Ave. said they have 
had workers diligently pick up trash, prohibited walk-in patrons and hired 
off-duty police officers to direct traffic. Jay Swerdlow, general manager for 
Pacific Theaters, said he went through nearby neighborhoods last Sunday and saw 
no signs of swap meet patrons, urination or litter. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said the swap meet's fixes never last long, with problems 
resurfacing after a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials indicated they'd like to close the swap meet, which last year 
paid the city close to $75,000 in business fees and sales taxes, perhaps by 
passing a law that would prohibit such uses near residential areas. The City 
Council asked the Planning Commission to make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to the testimony Tuesday, the commission gave its staff 90 
days to draft proposals to forward to the council. IRIS YOKOI

CITY HALL NEWS: HAWTHORNE; CITY ATTORNEY TO HAVE HEARING ON HIS FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne City Atty. Michael Adamson has requested a public hearing on the 
City Council's plan to fire him later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to have the hearing March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson, who received notice from the council last week that it intends to 
dismiss him March 25, said he wants to dispute allegations by some council 
members that he acted improperly to restructure his employment contract last 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a professional reputation to maintain," Adamson said Monday. "If 
anybody accuses me of bad lawyering or misconduct, they're just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council has declined to say exactly why it plans to fire Adamson, 
Lambert said Monday that the decision is linked to a disputed employment 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, signed privately last year by then-Councilman Charles 
Bookhammer, allowed Adamson to receive cash for a percentage of unused sick 
leave and vacation time. City officials said they believe the entire council 
needed to approve the agreement in public for it to be valid. In addition, they 
said the provisions might violate state retirement system rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the City Council invalidated the contract and a similar agreement 
with City Manager James H. Mitsch. No action is pending against Mitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson, a 17-year veteran of the city attorney's office, said he plans to 
take a vacation for the next few months and then seek work in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Being city attorney "is just too thankless a job," he said. SCOTT SANDELL

COVER STORY; OF PRIDE AND PREJUDICE; PROGRAMS AT TWO SCHOOLS USE BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH TO DISPEL STEREOTYPES, PROMOTE RACIAL HARMONY AND INSTILL PRIDE IN 
HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the heart of Black History Month celebrations lies the hope for racial 
harmony. February can provide an opportunity to teach those who are not black 
about black achievement, or it can give blacks a chance to learn about 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 At least that is how Black History Month, which began as Negro History Week in 
1929, has come to be celebrated in many public schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The two approaches say much about how Black History Month celebrations can 
reflect the experiences, perceptions and aspirations of students and 
administrators, regardless of the size of a school's black population.  
</P>
<P>
 At a Torrance elementary school with a tiny African American population, Black 
History Month was a time to teach young minds to look past stereotypes. 
Instructors at Howard Wood Elementary School chose to introduce their students 
to black achievers who defy racial stereotypes, hoping that that approach would 
build a reservoir of tolerance that would last the children into adulthood.  
</P>
<P>
 At Hawthorne High School, where 10% of the students are African American and 
racial wounds have already scarred some psyches, black teens used the 
observance to affirm their racial pride. The students, who put on a series of 
performances, chose to illustrate how black people find the spiritual strength 
to succeed in a society that, as they see it, will always be racially hostile.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the programs:  
</P>
<P>
 'I Try to Let the Work Make the Statement' 
</P>
<P>
 To drive home the point that African Americans are involved in technological 
development and the sciences, Wood Elementary, which has nine black students 
out of an enrollment of 450, invited two prominent black inventors to 
demonstrate their devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafeteria was darkened while Hawthorne inventor Joseph Jackson used a 
projector to demonstrate the Telecommander, a device that parents can use to 
restrict how much time and which programs their children watch on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The children murmured appreciatively as black, orange and green graphics slid 
across the screen. But their mood changed as they quickly began to understand 
the purpose of Jackson's invention. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say that Mom wants you to do homework from 3 to 5 (p.m.)," Jackson 
said. "Then all she does is press a button and block out that time on the TV 
and it won't come on. No matter where you go they're all blocked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange squares spread across the black grid on the screen and Jackson smiled 
at the audience. As if stunned that anyone would brag about such a device, the 
children remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson kept on. 
</P>
<P>
 "And with this button here, she can keep you from playing Nintendo (games) 
when it's time to do your homework." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the kids protested: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so messed up," they said to one another. "How could he do this?" "I 
can't believe it!" "Can you believe it?" "God, I hope my parents never hear 
about this!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jackson took questions. How did he become an inventor? What made him want 
to learn about electricity? Jackson did not talk about being a black man and 
what hurdles he had to leap to become an electrical engineer and inventor. The 
children did not ask about his color. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to let the work make the statement," he said afterward. "It's obvious 
who and what I am when I stand up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Patricia E. Bath, who developed and patented the cataract laserphacoprobe 
used for eye surgery, demonstrated her invention after Jackson finished. Bath, 
former chief of ophthalmology at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, 
told the children about the qualities of laser light while sending a red beam 
to different points in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The little children raced to touch the beam as it hit the back wall. The older 
ones were impressed, but were less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 A few, however, were puzzled: "I thought a laser was a gun," said 
second-grader Chris Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, lasers have many uses, but we want to emphasize the positive uses," 
Bath replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jackson, Bath did not mention her color, and the children did not ask her 
about it. Both said they hope the children simply remember that they have seen 
inventors who are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed after the assemblies, Jackson said that because of his race, he 
faced many obstacles in the Army and in his career, but he did not want to 
elaborate. Bath was more candid. 
</P>
<P>
 Bath said she has hit a glass ceiling in the corporate world, which, she 
speculates, would be happier to see her market fast food rather than medical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I know they'd let me sell fried chicken but medical technology?" 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate America, she said, does not see a black woman as the ideal marketing 
image for technology. 
</P>
<P>
 After a pause, Bath added: "But you know, I'm grateful to the corporate world 
for giving me this challenge. You can't be the first person to climb Mount 
Everest anymore and you can't be the first to go around the world anymore. If 
I'm the first African American woman to succeed with her invention in the 
corporate world, well, then thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wood school assembly was organized by Deborah Fountain, whose 10-year-old 
daughter, Brishette, and 6-year-old son, Glenn, attend Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we talk about the superhighway that is evolving as far as communication 
and technology, I want (the school's other students) to be sure to understand 
black people are there," said Fountain, a member of the school's multicultural 
relations committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The school administration has welcomed her efforts, Fountain said, but support 
for Black History Month has not been unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell that some of the teachers are thinking, 'Oh, no. We've got to put 
up with this again,' " Fountain said. " 'This woman is always forcing this 
stuff on us.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm trying to help this community," she said. "These children will be 
adults when California no longer will have a majority of people who are 
Euro-Americans. They need to know about other people in order (that) they can 
live harmoniously." 
</P>
<P>
 'What Matters is What 
</P>
<P>
 You Think of Yourself' 
</P>
<P>
 Days before the Wood Elementary assembly, the issue at Hawthorne High was 
harmony. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen-year-old Nicole Thrash's stomach was in knots. She had to sing a solo 
as part of a Umoja club gospel concert. Umoja -- Swahili for unity -- is the 
name of the school's predominantly black cultural club. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends clustered around her, arms around one another and heads bowed: "We 
have courage in the name of Jesus. All fear has to go right now! Hallelujah!" 
they said, praying away Thrash's butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert was the second event in the club's lineup of Black History Month 
events. The month began with a step show -- a type of rhythmic stomping and 
clapping done to chants that has been popularized by black college fraternities 
-- for the school. The gospel assembly was followed by a marketplace with 
African and African American goods. The last event was an assembly that 
re-created the famous Harlem night spot, the Cotton Club. 
</P>
<P>
 As the start of the gospel concert neared, students filled the bleachers in 
the cavernous gym, pulling on jackets against the morning chill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gym, a church scene was arranged. A pulpit, choir stand and seats were 
prepared. The Umoja members portraying the congregation were dressed in their 
Sunday best -- boys in dark suits and gleaming loafers, girls with skirts, 
pumps, fans and careful hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Brown, 17, had been sitting in the bleachers dabbing a handkerchief at 
his forehead. He jumped up to direct the choir as it stepped into the room, 
swaying to a gospel beat. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few songs, Thrash was joined by her brother, Robert, and the two sang 
"His Eye is on the Sparrow," a popular hymn that was sung at Martin Luther King 
Jr.'s funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should I feel discouraged, Why should the shadows come,  
</P>
<P>
 Why should my heart be lonely and long for heaven and home,  
</P>
<P>
 When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is he:  
</P>
<P>
 His eye is on the sparrow, and I know he watches me.  
</P>
<P>
 The audience cheered loudly and some left with tears in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne High Principal John Carter was elated. For once, camera crews, 
reporters and photographers descended on his school for a story unrelated to 
gangs, violence, crime or racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has had a reputation for poor race relations. During the past five 
years, teachers, staff members and former Principal Ken Crowe have brought 
numerous suits against the school district, alleging racial discrimination. In 
December, 1992, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that 
the district discriminated against black teachers and staff, and that it 
created a hostile environment for students. Last year, the U.S. Justice 
Department launched an investigation into the discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts at the school are centered on healing the wounds. The Umoja club's 
faculty advisers -- special education teacher Linda Ellis and campus security 
guard Cindy Henderson (both of whom settled discrimination suits against the 
school district out of court) -- said Umoja, which used to be called the 
African American club, changed its name to reflect its new emphasis on unifying 
the different factions at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The praise accorded the gospel concert demonstrated that such efforts are 
worthwhile, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "See! This is Hawthorne High School! This is what Hawthorne High School is 
about!" Carter said, milling among the singers after the show. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the kids in the performance who were the most ecstatic. The pianist 
and drummer kept playing as the audience left. Then they changed the beat, and 
Michael Brown broke into a hip-hop dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis and Henderson also were proud of the group for trying to convey the 
importance of the church in black life. To her, an event focusing on the black 
church seemed essential to a Black History Month celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The students themselves glowed when talking about their performances -- and 
the applause, the praise and the media attention they received. But the subject 
of black history itself sparked bitter comments, for the dozen or so kids 
interviewed say they have been taught little about their heritage beyond 
slavery and the civil-rights movement. In their minds, they haven't been taught 
more because white society wants them to focus on black degradation and 
struggle, not achievement and success. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, last month was not primarily a time to educate their non-black 
peers. Rather, their efforts mainly served to reinforce their sense of self. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do this for them," said Mona Brown, 16. "We do this because it shows 
we're proud of our history." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're also trying to bring togetherness and unity to this school," said 
senior Tiana Sanchez, 17, president of Umoja. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can be in (Umoja), not just black people. And people who were racist 
to Caucasian members are not in the club anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Umoja members said that in spite of the open-door policy, their club 
is regarded with suspicion by other students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it's because they're afraid of us," said Amee Henderson, Cindy's 
daughter. "They know we're stronger than they are because we have each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Her bitterness stems in part from incidents of racial hostility from her 
classmates. "Look at the racial atmosphere here. They call you a monkey. I've 
been called a monkey." 
</P>
<P>
 "But what matters is what you think of yourself," Sanchez replied. "What 
bothers me is that I know I don't know black history -- but that's because they 
won't teach it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez continued: "We were slaves. We used to pick cotton. The white man was 
prejudiced." She paused. "But I don't know about (people who) contributed to 
medicine or inventors. We know nothing about, like, inventors." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Amee: "That's all I know too. We were slaves, there was a war. Martin 
Luther King came. They treated some black people almost human." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozlynn Jamison says she does not expect to see much more progress. "Yeah, but 
we're never going to be exactly equal. We're never going to have what white 
people do and they're not going to let us get but so far. You never will see a 
black president."  
</P>
<P>
 Ellis has heard much of the conversation, but she does not interrupt. After 
the students leave, she agrees that Hawthorne High has "the potential to be 
hostile." 
</P>
<P>
 But the potential for harmony also exists. The kids are not defeated, even if 
they are frustrated. They are excited about their accomplishments and are 
learning that praise is sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Black History Month program was just the first step, a big first 
step, toward increasing self-awareness among African American students and 
promoting greater unity at the school, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial unity, she said, can be achieved, and the month's events in a small way 
do reach the intolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the events) touch some of them," Ellis said. "There are some people 
we will never touch and that's OK. The people I'm interested in touching are 
the kids themselves, and that's happening. But if this does make others look at 
black students differently, then all the better."

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; ADDING GREENERY TO VENICE BLVD. SCENERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of community activists, city officials and environmental 
volunteers hopes to transform part of recently repaved Venice Boulevard into a 
Los Angeles version of the Champs Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has embarked on the Venice Boulevard Landscaping Project, a 
tree-planting program to spruce up the roadway between Lincoln Boulevard and 
Pacific Avenue. The boulevard is lined with cinder-block apartment buildings, 
stucco houses, boat storage yards and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Many volunteers say that foliage and the pedestrians it would draw can 
transform the broad avenue, with its 1 1/2-mile dirt median, into a 
European-style thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nasty, hot, dry, dusty street to walk on. It looks like a freeway to 
Japan," said Diana Pollard, a volunteer in the program and a member of the 
Venice Chamber of Commerce. "By planting trees, we hope to knit the street 
together, to bring some cohesion to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 The project was started five weeks ago by Jim Murez, a Venice computer 
consultant and member of the environmental group TreePeople. The group received 
a $420,000 grant from the state Resources Agency to plant 1,000 California 
Sycamore trees on Venice streets, 400 of them on Venice Boulevard. That money 
came from a program set up in 1990 to allocate a small percentage of 
transportation funds for projects to offset the adverse effects of roadway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Venice High School students and others, Murez has planted 
more than 115 10-foot saplings, spaced 30 feet apart, along the roadway. In 
five to 10 years the sycamores will grow to 35 feet, eventually reaching 
heights of 60 to 80 feet. The trees have lush foliage with light green leaves 
and shredding bark. 
</P>
<P>
 The leafy colonnade, Murez said, will serve as "vehicles to get people out of 
their houses, to get people walking and talking." 
</P>
<P>
 "They will also add lots of texture and color to the area and provide a kind 
of filtered shade," Pollard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French and Italians recognize the value of their boulevards," Pollard 
said. "This project is a major opportunity to make the streets friendly. More 
green will be a form of psychological relief. Within 20 to 30 years there is 
going to be a big difference."

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MALIBU: Repealing Los Angeles County's prohibitive building restrictions in 
several flood-prone canyon areas, the City Council voted Monday to adopt codes 
and insurance rate guidelines written by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0, with Councilman Jeff Kramer absent, to adopt the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Plain Management Ordinance and its 
Flood Plain Insurance Rate Map. 
</P>
<P>
 The county regulations prohibited any building in so-called flood ways, areas 
that are much broader than the federal map's flood plains, and would have 
stopped rebuilding in Solstice, Latigo, Escondido and Zuma canyons in the wake 
of the Nov. 2 wildfires. The county had prepared, but never adopted, flood-way 
maps and studies for Malibu Creek, Ramirez and Trancas canyons and Las Flores 
Creek, an area hard hit by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal ordinance and its respective insurance maps do not preclude 
construction in flood plains, but impose limitations. The law requires creative 
rebuilding to protect property by such means as raising a building or 
installing dams and other devices to divert water flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the still-uncompleted Las Flores Canyon study will be discussed at a 
special meeting at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at Hughes Auditorium, 3011 Malibu Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 MEETINGS NEXT WEEK: 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles: 10 a.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. 200 N. Spring St. (213) 
485-3126.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; RENT COMMISSIONER IRVING KELLOGG, 79, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funeral services were held Tuesday for Beverly Hills rent commissioner Irving 
Kellogg, who died of a heart attack Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg, 79, was first appointed to the Beverly Hills Rent Adjustment 
Commission in 1989 and was reappointed to a second, four-year term last year, 
city spokesman Fred Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer board, established in 1979, resolves disputes between renters 
and owners of rent-controlled apartments over rent increases and charges passed 
along to tenants for building improvements and remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg, a certified public accountant, was a founder of the Kellogg & 
Andelson Accountancy Corp. in Los Angeles, and a member of the American and 
Beverly Hills bar associations. He was also the author of several financial 
texts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg, along with his wife, Evelyn, established the annual Evelyn 
Bard-Kellogg Honors Awards for graduates of the Los Angeles County Medical 
School of Nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife; two children, Dale K. Rose and Loren (Denise) 
Kellogg; a sister, Bertha Kayne; a brother, Jess Klubok, and four 
grandchildren.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; MAN DIES AFTER 23-STORY FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man died this week when he apparently leaped from a 23rd floor window at a 
Holiday Inn into a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man opened a window next to the elevators and jumped at about 
1:25 p.m. Sunday into about five feet of water. He was pulled from the pool in 
cardiac arrest and died en route to the hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact killed him. He may have ruptured his aorta," Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center spokesman Ron Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was not a guest at the North Highland Avenue hotel, said Los Angeles 
Police Lt. Eric Colter. There were no witnesses, but it did not appear that he 
was pushed, Colter said.

HEALTH CARE: WAYS TO IMPROVE SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was delighted to read in your February story "Operating Anew" that Santa 
Monica Hospital has joined with St. John's Hospital in planning how to expand 
health care services for the community on an individual and joint, cooperative 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 I would urge housing for the growing number of seniors, in a sizable graying 
population, be part of the planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Short- and long-term care is a health care need that requires housing. A 
hospital-related elderly housing facility can supply the "preventive" health 
care so vital at this stage of life, and a family situation that builds on 
mutual assistance and friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 And as all elderly have a minimum of Social Security and Medicare aid for 
self-pay, such a housing program can also benefit the hospital as a financial 
resource.

REMEMBERING THE MISSION OF NURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been an R.N. at St. John's for over 28 years, and must respond to your 
article ("Operating Anew," Feb. 24) by saying that I was totally embarrassed by 
the nurse who remarked, "Why the hell would they hire me with 10 years' 
experience and five weeks of vacation a year over someone at entry-level pay?" 
</P>
<P>
 I shall reapply for my former position to carry on the shared responsibility 
of mission (and) ministry which I have been so proud of, but, frankly, I hope 
someone who would respond in such a rough, unprofessional manner would not be 
rehired . (It's) simply not the image we want to portray to our community.

GOVERNMENT: PUBLIC INPUT AT CITY HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a special meeting of the Charter Review Commission that was held in Redondo 
Beach on Feb. 5, an interesting thing happened: a complete reversal of the 
commission members who wanted public input into their deliberations. A citizen 
went to the microphone and was excluded from discussing the public's 
business.The city attorney, Jerry Goddard, first ruled that the citizen could 
speak on the matter and informed Chairman David Serena that he was wrong in his 
interpretation of state law. Then, in a surprise move, Goddard told the 
commission how to prevent the public from addressing the legislative body. 
Commissioner Larry Cote quickly followed (his instructions) and was seconded by 
Pat Dreizler. I also was not allowed to speak on this item. As a representative 
of a community organization who believes in open and ethical government, I was 
appalled at the lack of ethics and accountability that these community leaders 
displayed. We see now that the service we get from our elected and appointed 
officials who say they want more input from the public appears to be just lip 
service.

CONSTITUTION: GUNS AND THE 2ND AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is little doubt that law-abiding citizens may have the right to buy, own 
and use firearms. But do you think that the framers of our Constitution could 
have imagined the havoc guns are now wreaking on our society? 
</P>
<P>
 What is more important, the safety of our citizens or the right of anyone to 
purchase unlimited quantities of weapons? Do you think that the authors of the 
2nd Amendment could anticipate the kind of powerful, lethal weapons that are 
now widely available to sociopathic thugs? 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a Manhattan Beach police officer was murdered in cold blood; in 
Inglewood, five people were killed in one day -- one, a baby only 2 years old. 
When will it stop? 
</P>
<P>
 Is one of the principal obligations of any government to do all that it can to 
enhance public safety? The gun lobby maintains that the 2nd Amendment is under 
fire. They do not acknowledge that not only are many thousand innocent 
Americans under fire, but that thousands are being killed by these guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Let them look at the record. The death rate from firearms leaped 14% between 
1985 and 1991. According to the National Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, in 1991 California and five other large states had more deaths from 
firearms than from motor vehicle accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of Americans are fed up with this carnage and demand there 
be more effective controls on the distribution of hand guns. Murder and armed 
robbery are the most feared felonies. According to FBI statistics, firearms are 
used in 55% of the murders and 40% of the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, but that right may be 
controlled. The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1939 that the right to 
keep and bear handguns is not guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 The gun lobby attempts to perpetuate the myth that gun control laws are 
ineffective. Let them look at the record of other freedom-loving countries. In 
1990, handguns killed 22 in Britain, 68 in Canada, and 87 in Japan. In the same 
year, 10,567 people were murdered by handguns in the United States. Hundreds of 
police officers have been slain in line of duty by handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun lobby insists that proposed control over guns will disarm law-abiding 
citizens, leaving them the helpless prey of criminals unaffected by these 
controls. Responsible law enforcement offices state that weapons in the private 
sector are ineffective in combatting crime. A recent study reports that the 
mere presence of a gun in a home is linked to a threefold increase in the risk 
of homicide for members of the household. 
</P>
<P>
 In conclusion, the least we can do as a nation is to make sure that those who 
buy or possess a handgun meet minimum qualifications, that they have been 
trained, sane, and without a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 If these deadly weapons are to be tolerated in our society, more has to be 
done to protect our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 I stand second to none in my reverence of the Constitution. I will not be 
passive in defending the 2nd Amendment. One way to preserve it is to diminish 
the number of gun casualties that is tearing the fabric of our nation. 
Responsible policies should seek to preserve life and the 2nd Amendment.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: LOUISIANA TREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That restaurant on Manchester Boulevard just before the San Diego Freeway may 
look like a Denny's, and a year ago it actually was a Denny's. But don't let 
that fool you. Today it's a welcoming Louisiana restaurant named Jonake's. 
</P>
<P>
 As you enter the reception area (decorated with prints of New Orleans), you'll 
see a casual dining area off to the left, with booths and counter seating that 
have the old coffee shop look. The main dining room, however, bears about as 
much resemblance to a Denny's as Louis Armstrong does to Lawrence Welk. 
Decorated with colorful Mardi Gras costumes, it features lacquered black 
chairs, white tablecloths, green carpeting and a profusion of plants. A French 
Quarter-style wrought iron railing, sparkling with tiny white lights, runs

 At lunch, the po' boy sandwiches are a big seller. These New Orleans 
specialties resemble submarine sandwiches but instead of cold cuts, you get a 
split French roll with lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise plus a filling such as 
salmon croquette ($7.95), fried catfish ($7.50), red snapper ($6.50) or fried 
oyster ($9.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Among non-sandwich items, a baked chicken breast ($7.95), coated with honey 
and pecans, is served with garlic bread and a choice of two of the following: 
green beans with yellow bell peppers, potato salad, cole slaw or steak fries. 
Chicken Marilyn ($7.95) is a breast sauteed in garlic sauce, served over pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, that New Orleans classic red beans and rice is available with spicy 
sausage ($10.95), two grilled pork chops ($12.95) or fried catfish ($13.95), or 
simply as a side dish ($3.95). 
</P>
<P>
 A popular selection is the seafood jambalaya ($13.95): mounds of shrimp, crab, 
oysters and clams served over steamed rice in white cream sauce ($13.95). The 
crunchy Southern fried chicken ($10.95) features a large breast, thigh and 
drumstick. Lately, I've been trying to stay away from eating chicken skin, but 
when I finished the fried chicken here, all that was left was bones.

 ARENA-BOUND 
</P>
<P>
 Although Inglewood High beat Santa Barbara, 70-53, in the Southern Section 
Division II-AA basketball semifinals Tuesday night at Morningside, the 
Sentinels acknowledged they weren't prepared for the Dons' 2-3 zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 2-3 threw us for a loop," Inglewood Coach Pat Roy said. "That was 
something we haven't faced all year. We're going to practice (playing) against 
it in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood doesn't have much time to prepare. The second-seeded Sentinels 
(27-3) meet top-seeded J.W. North of Riverside (28-0) in the II-AA final at 
2:45 p.m. Saturday at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory would give the Sentinels their first section title since 1980, the 
year they won the mythical national championship with an unbeaten team led by 
Ralph Jackson and Jay Humphries. Their last title appearance was in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, forward Paul Pierce led Inglewood to its 14th consecutive victory. 
The 6-foot-5 junior had game-high totals of 34 points, 13 rebounds, seven 
steals and three blocked shots. Guards Jason Crowe and Sam Turks added 12 and 
11 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the second half, we brought Paul up top (on offense)," said Roy, whose 
team led, 34-32, at halftime. "He creates a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Another area boys' team reached a section final when Banning defeated Bell, 
66-63, Tuesday at South Gate behind guard Jason Pickett's 28 points. The Pilots 
(18-11) will defend their City 3-A Division title against Roosevelt (14-11) at 
6:30 p.m. Friday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' basketball, second-seeded Peninsula (24-3) plays top-seeded Lynwood 
(28-1) in the Southern Section Division I-AA final at 8:30 p.m. Saturday at Cal 
Poly Pomona, and Banning (15-11) meets Pacific League rival Gardena in the City 
3-A final at 2:30 p.m. Friday at the Sports Arena. SOCCER FINALISTS 
</P>
<P>
 Three South Bay girls' soccer teams reached Southern Section finals with 
victories Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traci Arkenberg scored her 55th and 56th goals of the season to give Peninsula 
a 2-1 victory over host Capistrano Valley in a Division I semifinal. Arkenberg 
has either scored or assisted on all eight of her team's goals in three playoff 
games. The third-seeded Panthers (23-1-3) will meet top-seeded Marina of 
Huntington Beach (27-0-1) in the title game at 6 p.m. Friday at Gahr High in 
Cerritos. Peninsula's only loss was to Marina early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division II, goals by Bridgett Arnold and Michelle Calas lifted Bishop 
Montgomery over host Canyon of Anaheim, 2-1. The top-seeded Knights (21-2-2) 
play Esperanza of Anaheim (19-5-4) for the title at 2 p.m. Saturday at Gahr. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division IV, Chadwick earned its first trip to a section final by beating 
visiting La Reina, 2-1, behind goals by Nicki Gluckman and Wendy Uyeminami. The 
Dolphins (18-3) meet Prep League rival Pasadena Poly (27-1) in the final at 10 
a.m. Saturday at Gahr. RUNNER'S STORY 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Bob Holtel came up with a novel way to test the limits of 
human endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran from Mexico to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a story worth telling, which Holtel does in his book, "Soul, Sweat and 
Survival on the Pacific Crest Trail." 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old Manhattan Beach resident shares his experiences of running the 
equivalent of a marathon a day for 110 days, divided in three consecutive 
summers from 1985-87 when he was a physical education teacher at West Torrance 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing more daunting than Holtel's trans-continental run, he says, was 
the five years it took him to write the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was easier to run to Canada," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wanting to learn more about Holtel and his improbable journey can meet 
the author during a book signing at 8 p.m. Tuesday at the Hungry Mind, 916 
Manhattan Ave. in Manhattan Beach. PLAY BALL 
</P>
<P>
 A strong contingent of 12 South Bay teams opens the prep baseball season 
Friday in the 26th annual El Segundo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-team field includes Leuzinger, Narbonne, South Torrance, Peninsula, El 
Segundo, North Torrance, Hawthorne, Banning, Torrance, Carson, Mira Costa and 
West Torrance. El Segundo is the only area champion of the tournament in 13 
years, having won it in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured players include West Torrance infielder Derek Nicholson, the 1993 
South Bay player of the year and a preseason All-American; El Segundo pitcher 
David Reed, South shortstop Paul Weeks, Carson outfielder Daks Blanks and 
Peninsula pitchers Brian Bowles and Arin McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 3 p.m. games Friday involving top area teams, Peninsula plays host to 
Paramount, West is home against Muir and El Segundo travels to Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament continues through March 12, when the championship game is 
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at El Segundo Recreation Park. BASKETBALL HONORS 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two years after his father was named all-West Coast Conference, Loyola 
Marymount point guard Jim Williamson has been honored by the league's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The former South Torrance High standout became the first Loyola player 
selected WCC freshman of the year since the inception of the award in 1972, the 
year Duane Williamson was an all-conference guard for the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola forward Wyking Jones, a junior from St. Bernard High, was named to the 
10-player all-WCC team. St. Mary's guard Darrell Daniel, a senior from Bishop 
Montgomery, was honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Serra guard Ricky Price has been named to the West team for the 17th annual 
McDonald's All-America game, to be played April 3 in New York City and telecast 
live by CBS. The Duke-bound Price and guard Jelani Gardner of St. John Bosco in 
Bellflower were the only Californians selected. RETURN TRIP 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor College hopes the third time is a charm when it plays two-time 
defending champion Lassen at 2 p.m. today in the quarterfinals of the women's 
state basketball tournament at Solano College. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor lost in the quarterfinals the past two seasons, including a 96-91 
defeat by Lassen last season. The Seahawks will try to reverse that trend with 
perhaps their best team in four seasons under Coach Louie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor (28-6) features the state's highest-scoring tandem in sophomore guards 
LaTasha Burnett and JoAnne Williams, and for the second year in a row leads the 
state in margin of victory (26.2 points). 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks advanced to the final eight with victories over Santa Monica, 
74-51, and Cerritos, 70-52, in Southern Regional games last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett leads the state in scoring with a 28-point average, and also ranks 
among leaders in rebounding (13.4), assists (7.4), steals (9.2), and shooting 
(55%). Williams, who returned to basketball this season after taking a year 
off, ranks sixth among state scorers with a 27.3 average and has made 63 of 177 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's winners advance to the semifinals Friday, with the championship game 
at 7 p.m. Saturday. OH BROTHER 
</P>
<P>
 A sibling rivalry will be renewed Friday night when Loyola Marymount plays 
host to USC in a men's volleyball match. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Rick and Jim McLaughlin are the respective coaches at Loyola and USC. 
In their first meeting last year, USC beat Loyola, three games to none. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans are favored again. They entered the week ranked second in the 
nation and have a talented team that includes former Mira Costa standout Pat 
Ivie. THIS AND THAT 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Dominguez Hills opens the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
basketball tournament at 8 p.m. Friday by playing champion UC Riverside at 
Riverside. The winner advances the championship game Saturday against the

COVER STORY; PAVILION'S FATE TAKES CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's impossible to miss, though you might wish you could. 
</P>
<P>
 The closed Venice Pavilion -- widely considered a Venice Beach eyesore -- is 
drawing attention again as local groups debate what to do with the 33-year-old 
former theater. 
</P>
<P>
 While the coalition of businesses and residents sponsoring a boardwalk 
renovation plan support demolishing the city-owned pavilion, a group called the 
Venice Arts Mecca wants to restore the 600-seat theater. The year-old group 
would raise the nearly $1 million for renovation, then use the building for a 
day-care center, community theater, cafe and arts bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would provide art classes and job training for young people, 
supporting itself through sales of its artwork and products. Proponents say the 
pavilion could fill a dire need for affordable theater space on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to be on the boardwalk, but it's already there," said Bingwa 
Thomas, a 41-year-old actor who founded the art group. "It suits the needs for 
any group." 
</P>
<P>
 The pavilion's fate is among the thorniest issues on the beach. Some neighbors 
see the bunker-like structure as a hopeless white elephant. Past disagreements 
have deadlocked proposals to save it, tear it down or replace it with a skating 
area or aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 City recreation planners are studying what it would cost to save or demolish 
the building, and plan to seek proposals from other nonprofit groups. No 
deadline is set for a decision on the pavilion. KEN ELLINGWOOD

EDUCATION: USER-FRIENDLY CHANGES IN REPACKAGED SAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of teen-agers have been hearing about it, waiting for it, and even 
fearing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's here. No, not puberty, Saturday school, or a family vacation -- it's 
the new Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this month, college-bound students will take an SAT whose format has 
changed for the first time since 1974 (although the test has been administered 
since 1926). That has caused fear in the hearts of some teens, but is panic 
warranted? 
</P>
<P>
 What's so different about the new SAT? 
</P>
<P>
 The name, for one: The A in SAT now stands for Assessment, rather than 
Aptitude, since there's some valid scholarly debate about whether the test can 
truly measure a student's aptitude for learning. In addition, the SAT that most 
students will take is called SAT I. The one-hour achievement tests, which some 
colleges require in addition to the SAT I, are now called the SAT II, and the 
essay exam that accompanies the SAT II in English composition is now the SAT II 
writing test. If you can handle the name changes, then you're actually over the 
most frightening part; the changes in format are fairly friendly. The SAT I is 
still three hours long, and divided into math and verbal sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The newer math section measures the same kinds of skills as the old: 
arithmetic, geometry and algebra. The new verbal questions still test students' 
skills in reading comprehension, vocabulary, relationships between words and 
recognition of grammatical parts of sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The time allotted to each section, however, is now broken down differently 
than before. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section, which consisted of two 30-minute parts, now contains an 
additional 15-minute section. A 15-minute part also has been added to the usual 
two 30-minute sections of the verbal portion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the SAT I doesn't include the previously used 30-minute section of 
verbal or math questions that did not count toward the students' scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the kinds of questions asked on the SAT I, some changes will no 
doubt please test-takers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who founder on grammar, for example, will be thrilled to know that the 
SAT I is devoid of the Test of Standard Written English, which was composed of 
30 minutes of grammar and punctuation questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading comprehension section, now named critical reading, contains fewer 
passages. The passages are generally longer, though, and some must be compared 
and contrasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fill-in-the-blank questions will be shorter too; questions requiring you 
to think of the antonym of a word have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 And, contrary to popular rumors, there is no essay portion on the SAT I . . . 
Trust me! 
</P>
<P>
 The most talked about change in the math section is the end of the prohibition 
on calculators. You must provide your own calculator, though, so check those 
batteries before you head for the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 And while all math questions formerly were multiple choice, there are now some 
questions in which students must give answers on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the best way to know what to expect on the SAT I is to practice by 
taking the PSAT I (Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test). It's best to take 
the PSAT in October of your junior year, so you'll have enough time to learn 
your results and strengthen weak points before taking the real test the 
following spring.

OUT AND ABOUT / YAMAGUCHI BONSAI NURSERY; A YEN FOR MINIATURE TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Yamaguchi is an artist who molds trees into elegant statues. Owner of 
the Yamaguchi Bonsai Nursery in West Los Angeles, he is a master of bonsai, the 
art of growing miniature trees. 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that, last October, the George Yamaguchi North American Garden, a 
collection of bonsai, was dedicated at the U.S. Arboretum in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The nursery is nestled amid the apartment buildings, restaurants and stores 
along Sawtelle Boulevard and served by a nondescript entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside, there is a veritable forest of more than 2,000 bonsai plants, 
ranging in height from two inches to three feet. The smaller, younger plants 
start at $25. Larger, more mature plants can cost as much as $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamaguchi said there are several ways to grow bonsai. He prefers to coax 
juniper trees -- California and Japanese -- from seed, a process that requires 
a great deal of time, skill and patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a tree branches out, its miniature form is maintained by pruning the 
roots and branches. Growers use copper wires to bend trunks and branches to 
maintain molded shapes. If cared for properly, some trees can live for hundreds 
of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamaguchi, 81, takes great pride in his work, which he views as a way to 
create scenes from nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happened," said Yamaguchi, reflecting on his success. "Some people 
still can't do it after 30 years (of trying) because they don't have the 
patience." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Japan, Yamaguchi graduated from the Cultural High School in 
Hiroshima. He moved to Los Angeles in the late 1930s and worked as a landscape 
gardener before opening his nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three decades, he has grown and sold bonsai to customers, many 
of whom travel from throughout the country to make purchases for their outdoor 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen anywhere else (in the city) that has the (same) quality of 
bonsai," said Glenn Austin, who drove from Glendale to visit the nursery. "This 
is a unique spot in California." 
</P>

 NOT TO BE 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a Westchester-Crenshaw championship game turned out to be 
premature. Although the Cougars will defend their title in the City Section 4-A 
Division finals Friday at the Sports Arena, the Comets' season came to a 
surprising end Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Howzell scored Dorsey's last seven points to help the Dons upset 
Westchester, 71-68, in the quarterfinals at Westchester. Howzell made 
consecutive three-point shots to give Dons their first lead, 69-68, with 47 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we wanted to win as badly as they did," Westchester Coach Ed 
Azzam said. "They were more aggressive going after rebounds and they came up 
with the loose balls. They are very athletic. They're a good team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said all along: 'If we don't play hard, we're not that good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets (24-5) should be improved next season. They return nine players, 
including four starters and two top reserves. Returning starters Ben Sanders, a 
junior, and Danny Walker, a sophomore, should be among the best players in the 
Coastal Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Azzam starts thinking about next basketball season, he has to worry 
about another sport he coaches -- junior varsity softball, which began Tuesday. 
SHOT DOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax, the area's second-rated team, had one of the best defensive teams in 
the City, but also had one of the poorest shooting teams. On Friday, the Lions 
shot only 27% from the field in a 55-47 loss to Fremont in a 4-A quarterfinal 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Davis scored 17 points and Terryl Woolery had 16, but the rest of the 
team managed only 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lion Coach Harvey Kitani was impressed with his team's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the most enjoyable season I've ever had coaching," said 
Kitani, who won City titles in 1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone had a great attitude the whole year. There were no ego problems to 
deal with. Usually I have one or two guys who are chronic complainers. This 
year, coaching was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Three Fairfax players are expected to receive scholarships to play college 
basketball next season. Woolery, a 6-foot-4 forward, is being recruited by 
Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount. Shaphan Roberts, a 6-2 guard, and Tony Davis, 
a 6-3 guard, are being recruiting by Division II schools. CLEARING THE BENCH 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernard girls' basketball team is tired of being criticized for 
running up the score. Can they help it if they held their playoff opponents to 
less then 30 points a game? 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's Southern Section Division IV-AA semifinal game, the Vikings beat 
Morro Bay, 51-16. Viking forward Olympia Scott had 26 points, 31 rebounds and 
four blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, along with the Vikings' other starters, did not play the last four 
minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We substituted players throughout the game," Viking Coach Lori Pawinski said. 
"That might have hurt us because the players will not be sharp for the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard will not have an easy time defensively when the Vikings play Santa 
Ynez in the championship game Friday night at Lompoc High. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shoot well, they pass well," Pawinski said. "They're a good team. We 
have to be a lot more aggressive and not give up the easy shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings plan to utilize their height advantage underneath with 6-2 Scott 
and 6-4 center Marte Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will go inside like we always do, but we're going to try and fast break a 
little more," Pawinski said. TURNAROUND 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the City Section soccer playoffs have been dominated by teams 
from the San Fernando Valley and East Los Angeles. So what was a Westside team 
like Hamilton still doing in the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe winning? 
</P>
<P>
 But after beating traditional powers Reseda and Monroe, the Yankees' attempt 
to make it three consecutive wins over San Fernando schools ended Tuesday in 
the City Section quarterfinals. They lost to Kennedy, 2-1 
</P>
<P>
 Only two years ago the team had a 1-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, however, started their turnaround last season when Bob Zapel 
became a volunteer assistant. Zapel, who began coaching his two sons at the 
American Youth Soccer Organization level in 1989, and Coach Jose Ramos guided 
the team to a 3-5-2 record in 1992 and a 9-3-1 record this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The team was led by senior center-forward David Close, who had seven goals and 
12 assists in 12 games. Left halfback Ben Braun, right halfback Jose Rivas, 
sweeper Oscar Rivas (no relation) and right-forward Victor Gonzalez were the 
team's other top players. All five were selected to the Metro League first 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Zapel's son Sean also played soccer for the Yankees. His younger son Brett is 
a freshman pitcher for Crossroads varsity baseball team. SEAN WATERS

TOMM RUUD; DANCER WITH SAN FRANCISCO BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tomm Ruud, a San Francisco Ballet principal dancer best known for his role as 
Drosselmeyer in "The Nutcracker," has died at age 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruud died Monday at his home of AIDS-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years with William Christensen's Ballet West in Salt Lake City, Ruud 
joined the San Francisco Ballet in 1975. In the 1986-87 season, he was made a 
principal character dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruud was born in Pasadena and raised in Afton, Wyo. He received bachelor's and 
master's degrees in dance from the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made guest appearances with national and international ballet 
companies and dance festivals, including the National Ballet of Canada, the 
Ninth International Ballet Festival in Havana, the Pacific Northwest Ballet and 
the Oakland Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Ruud danced the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet" and the pas de 
deux from "La Fille Mal Gardee" for a "Magic of Dance" program with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruud also choreographed several works that are in the San Francisco Ballet's 
repertoire, including "Mobile," "Metamorphoses," "Trilogy," "Introduction and 
Allegro," "Richmond Diary" and "Step for Two." 
</P>
<P>
 A short subject film, "Balances," released in 1981, is based on his best-known 
ballet, "Mobile."

 The cops hope Jack didn't use the club: So whose photo is on posters all over

 Nicholson, who faces arraignment March 31, is host of the charity golf 
tournament.

 A spokesman for the May 14 event at Rancho Park said there's been no

CIA AGENT HELD AS SPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "CIA Official Held as Russian Spy," Feb. 23, and "For Ames, a 
Wife and a Crossroads in Mexico City," Feb. 26: 
</P>
<P>
 Accused CIA official Aldrich Hazen Ames' job was trying to bribe Soviet 
diplomats into spying for the United States. He knew exactly what to look for 
in those personnel -- those who had had a "major career setback, a sense of 
having been betrayed by their own government" and those with "dreams of glory, 
trying to restore a sense of efficacy and personal importance," the same words 
used to describe Ames by a CIA psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is perfectly fine and legal for the United States to "turn" Soviets into 
spies for it, but if the Soviets do the same to our people in government, all 
hell breaks loose. 
</P>
<P>
 God, I love politics! It gives me so many good belly laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID CHARLES KEETON

</P>
<P>
 * The one aspect of the Ames spy case I find both humorous and sad is that he 
was purchased so cheaply. For a mere $150,000 yearly the Russians obtained 
information worth a thousand times that amount. Were I offered what amounts to 
petty cash to sell out my nation and countrymen, I'd fall down laughing. What 
galls me is our "intelligent" CIA putting someone with trailer-trash tastes in 
such an important position, then failing to closely watch his actions for a 
full decade. Who runs things at the CIA? Maybe the Three Stooges. CIA should 
translate as the Central Imbecilic Agency! The Russians must be laughing their 
heads off at us. 
</P>
<P>
 FRED HERMON

<P>
 * The CIA espionage case should be a vivid wake-up call for America and 
especially for military budget-slashing liberal Democrats and President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russian missiles may not be pointed at us, for the moment, Russia 
still poses a threat to our national security. Communism is alive and there 
still are Russians in high offices who cling to the idea of world domination 
and the destruction of the United States and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not be lulled into a sense of false security. Ronald Reagan toppled the 
Soviet Union with a strong military.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, by weakening our military and defenses, is repeating the same mistake 
of Jimmy Carter. He's inviting every crack-pot dictator and terrorist to attack 
Americans and American interests around the world. While it is wise to extend 
an olive branch to communists, it is also wise to keep the rest of the tree 
around to beat them over the head with -- if need be!

 * Clinton's outraged indignation over the current spying revelations reminds 
one of Claude Raines' (the police magistrate in the movie "Casablanca") similar 
protestations (as he refers to gambling in Rick's place and at the same time 
pockets his winnings) suggesting: "Spies? I'm shocked to find out that there is 
spying going on! Round up the usual suspects!"

 * Vladimir Pozner's article ("U.S. Spies! Russian Spies! Who Would Have 
Believed It!" Commentary, Feb. 24) reveals ignorance of the U.S. Constitution 
in which "traitor" and "treason" are defined. His reference to Jonathan Pollard 
is wrong and careless. The official record indicates that he was neither 
accused nor indicted for treason. Personal bias aside, if Pozner seeks 
credibility, he owes a retraction to his readers. 
</P>
<P>
 MORRIS POLLARD 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pozner incorrectly draws a parallel between the Ames case and that of 
Jonathan Pollard, who as he says is still serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard was faced with a dilemma when information on chemical, biological and 
nuclear warfare activities in Iraq and Syria -- which should have been shared 
with Israel under treaty, as an ally -- was not being shared with Israel. He 
didn't harm the U.S. In fact he cooperated with the authorities, including 
accepting a plea bargain and relieving them of the need for an open trial with 
its implications. 
</P>
<P>
 The real treason was by Caspar Weinberger, the then secretary of defense, who 
was pardoned by President Bush Dec. 24, 1992, and other public servants who 
violated this country's obligation to its ally, Israel. The recent spate of 
wild allegations against Pollard from former Defense Secretary Les Aspin and 
others -- and now the Ames case -- shows where the mess really is!

since 1985. It's nice to know when Gorbachev met with Reagan and Bush at least 
one of the participants was in the loop.

LABOR WATCH; TACKY TACTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scare tactics are nothing new in hardball union contract negotiations. 
Unfortunately, the scare tactic in vogue for unions in Los Angeles seems to be: 
"Give us what we want or we'll tell everyone what a terrible place L.A. is." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a wise strategy in 1992 when the Los Angeles Hotel and Restaurant 
Employees Union used it. It was not a wise strategy when United Teachers-Los 
Angeles threatened to use it later the same year. And it's not a smart strategy 
now for the Police Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 Police union officials threatened this week to distribute a video warning 
tourists that Los Angeles is a dangerous place to visit. The video would 
include footage from the 1992 riots and crime statistics intended to alarm 
potential tourists and conventioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, violent crime in Los Angeles is lower than in most other major 
cities. But beyond that fact is the incredible shortsightedness of this ploy. 
If L.A. unions scare away tourism dollars, how does that help their members get 
paid more? 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say that beleaguered LAPD officers don't deserve support, 
because they do. The city's decision to grant 9% pay raises over four years to 
Department of Water and Power workers last fall, when police had worked for 
well over a year without a contract, understandably sticks in the craw of most 
officers. But bad-mouthing the city, and discouraging the inflow of cash, won't 
fill officers' checkbooks. Surely cooler heads in the police union can make the 
case that this is a tactic best left unpursued.

TALKING TRADE AMID THE HUBBUB; U.S. BIDS TO GRAB TROUBLED TOKYO'S ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S.-Japan trade standoff is unfolding against a backdrop of continuing 
political turmoil in Tokyo. As Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa pushed for a 
voluntary market-opening program under growing U.S. pressure, he was distracted 
by a two-week effort to reshuffle his Cabinet, an effort he now has abandoned. 
To keep Tokyo focused on the trade problem, the Clinton Administration has 
raised the specter of reinstating the tough Super 301 trade order, which would 
allow the President to quickly impose sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa wants to have a market-opening plan ready this month. So far, Tokyo 
is considering reducing its current account surplus to 2.8% of gross domestic 
product, down from an estimated 3.1% this year. That is unsatisfactory because 
it is not binding and does not take into account volatile exchange and interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, a policy change depends on Tokyo's bureaucrats, notoriously 
resistant to change. It is likely that in an attempt to placate U.S. trade 
negotiators they simply will repackage past "process" efforts to open markets. 
While that foot-dragging strategy worked for 12 years, it is unacceptable to 
President Clinton. However, Washington must be careful not to allow Tokyo to 
score public-relations points against this country by turning this controversy 
into a free trade issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In only one of 31 U.S.-Japan trade agreements is Japan committed to giving up 
a share of its market. Clinton understandably wants more, specifically 
"qualitative and quantitative measures of progress." Tokyo has interpreted that 
as meaning numerical targets and cleverly cast the Clinton approach as "managed 
trade." That characterization, unfortunately, has been accepted by some U.S. 
trading partners; and the Administration has done little to persuasively 
counter this criticism. Washington is seeking "results," which it says are not 
the same as targets. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently described 
the goal as devising a "speedometer" to monitor trade, not a "speed limit" on 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to Japan is not a U.S. problem alone. In concluding his Washington 
visit this week, British Prime Minister John Major said Japanese acceptance of 
imports is "a matter of concern throughout the European Union." 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo may not like Clinton's tough approach, but things could be worse for 
Japan. Congress is getting into the act. Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and 
Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W. Va.) introduced a bill requiring the Commerce 
Department to unilaterally set targets for foreign imports in Japan. That is 
managed trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Voluntary changes by Japan are preferable to imposing sanctions. If Tokyo 
truly views its relationship with the United States as maturing, it must grow 
to this challenge.

PLUGS FOR PUBLIC-SAFETY HOLES; QUAKE-CAUSED LEAKS IN OIL PIPELINE RAISE A 
WARNING FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to the standards set by the California Government Code, the 
underground pipeline that carries crude oil from Kern County fields to the Los 
Angeles Refinery in Carson was not a high-risk pipeline. Still, the Four 
Corners Line No. 1 leaked at eight locations after the Northridge earthquake. 
The worst of those breaks was not the largest: Crude that seeped to the surface 
on Wolfskill Street in Mission Hills somehow ignited, injuring a man and 
charring 17 cars and a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery that the pipeline is one of the state's oldest, built in 1925 with 
old-fashioned acetylene welds, generated even more concern among officials. 
First, the Los Angeles City Council slapped a moratorium on new pipeline 
franchise agreements. The San Fernando City Council followed by ordering the 
operator to forgo pumping until the city received a report on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But these local initiatives, in part, exceeded municipal powers. By state and 
federal statute, responsibility for petroleum pipeline safety rests with the 
state fire marshal's office. Fortunately, that office appears to be assessing 
not only the Wolfskill spill but the warning it has raised for oil pipelines 
throughout the state. There are 8,000 miles of underground petroleum pipeline 
in California, enough to run from Los Angeles to New York City and back, with 
2,000 miles to spare. Those with acetylene welds should be checked for the 
kinds of problems that led to the Wolfskill spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire marshal's office says that the Four Corners line will not reopen 
until it has been tested exhaustively. Findings should be shared with local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there is another issue that local officials will have to look at. 
The state fire marshal says that the pipeline's owner, Arco, agrees that it 
should be taken out of service and replaced with a pipeline that avoids 
residential areas. The task of choosing a new route is sure to be difficult, 
not to mention politically unpopular. But county and city officials cannot 
avoid this responsibility, so the sooner they begin discussions with state 
officials and Arco the better.

QUASHING AN ENEMY OF PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As of late Wednesday Israeli security forces had been able to find and arrest 
only one of the five Jewish extremists Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has ordered 
taken into preventive detention. Meanwhile, Rabin announced that the movements 
of 18 other extremist settlers would be restricted in the aftermath of last 
week's massacre of Palestinians at a mosque in Hebron by an Israeli fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt that the revulsion, shame and concern expressed by Rabin's 
government and most Israelis over that atrocity are genuine and deep. The fact 
remains that the government has yet to take measures appropriate to the basic 
threat raised by a militant Israeli minority, not just against the safety of 
Palestinians but against the government's own peace policy. A U.S. State 
Department official told a congressional hearing this week that there are 
"several thousand" militant settlers Israel should be worrying about, not just 
the few dozen who have been targeted so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace process probably will survive the horror of last week's killings, 
because in the final analysis responsible Israeli and Palestinian leaders know 
that to let it collapse would surely be to doom their two peoples to further 
years, even decades, of costly and futile conflict. Whether popular opinion 
would allow leaders to pursue peace should there be anything like a repetition 
of the Hebron blood bath, directed against either side, is another matter. It's 
no secret that the most militant among Israel's 120,000 settlers -- like the 
most militant in the Palestinian camp -- are eager to wreck the peace process. 
The Rabin government is courting grief if it doesn't move quickly to neutralize 
this sedition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time the Palestine Liberation Organization, if it's as serious 
about wanting peace as Chairman Yasser Arafat assured Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher it is, must stop using the Hebron tragedy as a basis for raising 
wholly unrealistic political demands. Rabin is not about to move the issue of 
the settlements to the forefront of negotiations -- that, under the agreed 
timetable, is still several years away -- nor is he going to disarm all the 
settlers, as the PLO insists. But Rabin can do a lot more to deal effectively 
with security on the West Bank just as Arafat, by taking greater care with his 
public comments, can do a lot more to assure the survival of the peace process.

THE MEANING OF GRAY'S 'ELEGY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'm sorry to see that professor Jenijoy La Belle of Caltech, in the midst of 
a fine discussion of the past popularity and present obscurity of Gray's 
"Elegy," has somehow decided to distort its meaning (Commentary, Feb. 16). The 
poem is not about the lack of importance of class distinctions "in the greater 
scheme of things." Gray doesn't find the rich and the poor united in death 
because he sets the poem in a "country churchyard," where only the poor are 
buried, while the rich are buried inside, under the church floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's basic distinction is not between poor and rich, but between the 
anonymous and the famous. These poor people buried in the churchyard may have 
been nameless and obscure, he says, but they also didn't commit the sins that 
the aspiration to fame and greatness brings with it. La Belle may be right that 
the poem is now itself obscure because our own society is unsympathetic to 
Gray's message. That lack of sympathy is, however, not caused by a desire to 
sweep away the theme of death, but by a preoccupation with the theme of fame. 
In a world where people parade their intimate lives on talk shows and no 
toenail clipping of the even vaguely famous is too minute to be ignored by the 
media, it's easier to face death than it is to understand why someone would 
write a poem praising the virtues of being anonymous.

 * La Belle's tribute to Gray's "Elegy" was an excellent piece. Her linking the 
"paths of glory lead but to the grave" lines to "the democracy of death" is 
eloquent. However it should be noted that a different, quite cynical 
interpretation of those lines has been made by Marxist-oriented critics. They 
say that Gray's intent was to persuade the common people, the poor and the 
downtrodden that they should not envy or resent the rich and powerful because 
even they who have trod the paths of glory end up in the grave like everyone 
else. The implication being that whether one is on the top or bottom of the 
heap in this life is really not important because death awaits us all. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a testimony to the greatness and universal appeal of the poem that it 
can be interpreted to reinforce widely divergent philosophies and views of the 
human condition.

TUSKEGEE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The article "Blood Brothers and Sisters" by Karen Grigsby Bates (Commentary, 
Feb. 23) effectively addressed the serious lack of blood donors among African 
Americans. Dispelling the myths surrounding Dr. Charles Drew's death will 
hopefully contribute to an increased willingness among African Americans to 
donate blood and organs.However, while Ms. Bates cited the infamous Tuskegee 
Study as a likely additional explanation as to why blacks are less willing to 
participate in such programs, her statement that "black men . . . were 
surreptitiously injected with live syphilis virus so that the Army could study 
the disease" contains several factual errors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Tuskegee Study, conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service -- not the 
Army -- black men with syphilis were left untreated, beginning in the 1930s and 
continuing over a period of up to 40 years, in order to observe the "natural" 
course of the disease. Although clearly immoral and ethically repugnant 
(particularly after penicillin became widely available in the 1940s), the study 
did not involve the injection of live syphilis into anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, syphilis is not a virus; it is caused by a spirochete, a form of 
bacteria, which is why, unlike viruses, it is treatable with antibiotics. It 
would be most unfortunate if in so cogently deflating one myth the author 
inadvertently contributed to creation of another.

COLUMN LEFT/ CRAIG HANEY: 3 STRIKES FOR RONNIE'S KIDS AND, NOW, BILL'S; TODAY'S 
VIOLENT YOUNG MEN GREW UP IN CITIES DEVASTATED BY CALLOUS GOVERNMENT POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG HANEY, Craig Haney teaches courses on law, criminology and psychology 
at UC Santa Cruz. For 20 years, he has been studying the psychological effect 
of incarceration and the backgrounds of violent criminals. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stirring portion of his State of the Union address, President Clinton 
spoke of a generation of violent youngsters in America's toughest neighborhoods 
consigned to live in a "vast vacuum filled by violence, drugs and gangs." In 
their eagerness to lock up these young people and their older brothers forever 
after giving them "three strikes," none of our newly tough-on-crime political 
leaders have bothered to talk about where these kids came from, or how the 
vacuum in which they live was created. 
</P>
<P>
 They were born 13 years to the day before Clinton's speech, when another 
freshman President presented his vision of the decade ahead. Ronald Reagan's 
vision was one in which "big government" was not only taken off the backs of 
the people, but also taken out of the inner cities. Job training programs were 
cut back, monies for neighborhood recreation centers and teen counselors were 
withdrawn, summer programs for inner-city kids were canceled and funding for 
drug counseling, rehab centers and other programs dried up as government 
learned how to "just say no" to poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more. The Reagan Administration limited the pursuit of 
class-action lawsuits whose outcomes might benefit whole communities of poor 
people rather than just individual litigants. Under the stewardship of a man 
who later was rewarded with an appointment to the Supreme Court, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission turned its back on thousands to whom equal 
opportunity or fair treatment had been denied.  
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists worried about the long-term consequences of these policies and 
predicted that ripping away the safety net from poor and minority communities 
would leave nothing but a social and economic wasteland, precisely the sort of 
place that would serve as a breeding ground for crime among those people whose 
lives were just beginning. We worried, too, about the consequences of increased 
incarceration on these communities. What would happen to the growing number of 
families whose men were taken off to prison, warehoused for unprecedented 
periods of time, learning little more than cynicism, hatred and hopelessness? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the very few things "big government" did with enthusiasm during the 
Reagan and Bush years was incarcerate young minority citizens. Most people now 
know that there are more young African American men behind bars than in 
college.  
</P>
<P>
 No one has said much about the impact of these policies, already the harshest 
punishments ever seen in the history of modern corrections, on the breakdown of 
community and family in the inner cities. As President Clinton ponders the 
whereabouts of absent fathers in these neighborhoods, he need look no further 
than in the scores of already overcrowded prisons built by his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Children born at the dawn of this new era are just now coming of age. These 
are "Ronnie's Kids": They owe their cynicism, hopelessness and anger to the 
same President whose heartless social policies created the "vast vacuum" in 
which they were left to mature. They are coming of age in time to frighten 
conservative and liberal politicians and to face the Draconian "three strikes" 
legislation that has become the test of every politician's criminal-justice 
manhood. President Clinton's recent afterthought that perhaps "every offense in 
the world" shouldn't be included only illustrates how badly and bizarrely this 
discussion has been skewed. Indeed, if all the proposed legislation passes, 
many of these children will have their first strike by age 14 or 15 (just a 
little older than the President's own daughter), and surely many will achieve 
their third by their 18th birthdays. Having lived the first part of their lives 
in the vacuum created by the actions of one President, they will be condemned 
to live the remainder inside the walls of a gulag made possible by another. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is also Reagan's legacy that we seem to have become a country more 
comfortable spending vast sums of money to hurt certain of our citizens rather 
than to help them. Although no one could ask for clearer evidence of the 
futility of exclusively punishment-oriented policies than the youthful violence 
that plagues us now, President Clinton seems hellbent on repeating this tragic 
and destructive example. If he persists, 13 years from now there will be 
another generation of rootless, desperately angry and frightening young people 
that some new President will struggle to control. These will be "Bill's Kids." 
The only difference is that there will be many more of them, and they will be 
much, much angrier.

THE CLASH OF DARKNESS AND LIGHT; HEBRON: RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS IDENTIFY WITH 
DIVINE POWER IN ANNIHILATING THE FORCES OF CHAOS -- THE DEHUMANIZED 'OTHER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. WOLKOFF, Rabbi Robert L. Wolkoff writes and lectures on political 
and theological matters. He is based in Appleton, Wis. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The massacre in Hebron is completely understandable, even reasonable -- if you 
live in an insane world. The murderer, a radical follower of Rabbi Meir Kahane 
(who himself fell victim to a religious extremist) lived in that kind of world. 
So did many of his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 One could never understand this from the entirely predictable public reactions 
to the massacre. The Israeli government condemned it in the strongest possible 
terms. Some commentators have tried to shift responsibility to the Muslim 
extremists whose murder of Jews supposedly drove Baruch Goldstein out of his 
mind. Such attempts to mitigate the evil done were in turn condemned. Others 
condemned once again the mutual "demonizing" that colors Arab-Israeli 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this misses the point. That a religious person -- a doctor, no less -- 
could go into one of his own religion's holiest sites and mow down dozens of 
worshipers of another faith is a phenomenon that cannot be explained in normal 
political terms. It is violence that literally is not of this world -- 
religious violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious violence is a form of sacrificial offering, a destructive action 
with emotionally charged symbolism. It seldom has, and never needs, a 
reasonable political purpose or well-defined goal. It is quite likely that the 
murderer himself would not have been able to say what his actions would mean -- 
except that they would lead to more violence. What was important for him was 
precisely and solely the demonstration of destructive power. Because it was, in 
his eyes, the power of the Lord being demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 That the massacre took place on holy ground is entirely consistent with the 
symbolism of religious violence. That it took place on a day that was both the 
beginning of Ramadan (the holiest time of year for Muslims) and Purim (when 
Jews read in the Book of Esther of the planned destruction of the Jews of 
Persia, and of their counterattack) even gives the massacre a perverse 
elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 The charged symbolism reflects in turn the most terrifying aspect of religious 
violence, the conviction that one is engaged in a cosmic conflict. In an 
apocalyptic war between the "sons of light and the sons of darkness" (as it is 
described in the Dead Sea Scrolls) there is no room for compromise. In fact, 
there is no one with whom one could compromise. The "other" is outside the 
realm of the human, a mere symbol of the forces of chaos, a ritual object in 
the great, dramatic demonstration of divine power. His role is to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In this context, all objections concerning the (for us, absolutely clear) 
immorality of the massacre are useless. The murderer is beyond good and evil in 
his own eyes -- and, thus, in the eyes of the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
 To criticize the religious extremists' view of the "other" as demonizing is 
misdirected. Such criticism implies that if only both sides understood one 
another better, they would be able to act in a reasonable, humane manner. In a 
religious war, the opposite is the case: The more one knows about the "other," 
the clearer it becomes that he truly is the tool of chaos -- the more, in other 
words, he becomes the "other," a true demon, thus an object for extermination. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this mutual "insight" in place of mutual understanding that aggravates 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Palestinians, the most common reaction to the massacre in the mosque has 
been, "They say they want peace, and then they go and do this!" 
</P>
<P>
 "They?" How could one possibly interpret the crime of Baruch Goldstein as a 
collective Israeli act? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: psychological projection. The Muslims see the massacre as a 
collective Israeli/Jewish act precisely because that is how they would 
interpret it if the ethnic affiliation of murderer and victim had been 
reversed. It is not the massacre itself that they condemn (as the Western 
standard would condemn any massacre), but rather the fact that a Jew committed 
it and Muslims were his victims when it should have been the other way around. 
This is not to shift the blame from the criminal to the victim. But it does 
underscore a tragic difference in perspective that is dominant in the Middle 
East.  
</P>
<P>
 This categorizing of moral and immoral massacres is, of course, anathema in 
Western moral thought. The frightening fact is, however, that Western moral 
thought has nothing to do with it. For both Jewish and Muslim extremists, the 
only thing that can solve their problems is the Lord's destructive power. 
Symbolic (if still tragically real) violence is used to express this and to 
evoke it. It allows the extremist the possibility of complete identification 
with the cosmic order, in which he, carrying out divine will, annihilates the 
forces of chaos. His life means nothing in this context, his victims' lives 
even less. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ask if the peace process is going to continue. The answer is obvious. If 
it doesn't, one can only expect more of the same. There are enough people on 
both sides who wish to avoid that. 
</P>
<P>
 But how hopeful should one be? While political and economic steps could 
conceivably weaken the driving force of religious extremism, it would be 
dangerously naive to believe that they could entirely counteract an ideological 
constellation that belongs to another -- insane -- world. 
</P>
<P>
 That there is, objectively speaking, a huge difference in proportions -- 
Jewish extremists constitute a small and despised minority, while their Muslim 
counterparts enjoy considerable popular support -- is of lesser significance. 
We have, after all, just seen the horrible damage that a lone individual can 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The massacre was an expression of a serious religious problem, which must 
receive a religious solution. Unfortunately, that is, under present 
circumstances, wishful thinking.

COLUMN RIGHT/ PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS: SQUEEZED BIRD MAY WARBLE SOUR NOTES; THE 
WHITEWATER PROBE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO JEOPARDIZE WITH TAINTED TESTIMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts, a former assistant Treasury 
secretary, is chairman of the Institute for Political Economy in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitewatergate special prosecutor Robert B. Fiske Jr. is too experienced a 
lawyer to be making such a big mistake. He is damaging the credibility of a key 
witness in the Whitewater scandal by trying the witness before questioning him 
about President Clinton's role. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness is David Hale, a former Arkansas judge who has been indicted for 
small-business loan fraud. Hale has indicated that he has information about 
Clinton's role in possibly illegal financial dealings. Fiske himself has said 
that to investigate Whitewater allegations against Clinton, "it is imperative 
that we interview defendant Hale or compel his testimony." Fiske added: "This 
cannot be done until the present case (against Hale) has been resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Fiske is simply caught up in the traditional dirty tactics of 
prosecutors and isn't thinking. When a defendant has knowledge that bears on a 
case other than his own, prosecutors prefer to first convict the defendant and 
then question him about the other case, prior to sentencing on the first. Since 
the prosecutor's recommendation will affect the length and severity of 
sentence, the witness can be "squeezed" to tell the prosecutor what he wants to 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz has noted that this squeeze tactic 
allows prosecutors to enlist perjury in pursuit of other defendants. By 
prosecuting the witness first, before hearing what he has to say, and holding 
the sentence over his head like the sword of Damocles, prosecutors can get the 
squeezed witness not only to sing, but also to compose. 
</P>
<P>
 We certainly do not want Clinton to join the long list of Americans who have 
been implicated by squeezed witnesses. But, of course, we don't know what 
Fiske's motives are. Perhaps he wants the squeeze hold on Hale in order to 
compel exonerating testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewatergate allegations swirling around the first couple, and their 
aides' suspicious behavior in removing files from a dead man's office and then 
lying about it, are far more serious for the country than the prosecution of a 
small-timer for petty loan fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent questions about the truth of Hale's Whitewater testimony, and to 
dispel questions about his own integrity, Fiske must drop the current 
prosecution of Hale, grant him immunity and put him on the stand about 
Whitewater. Hale's testimony will be a lot more credible -- whether it 
implicates or exculpates Clinton -- if Fiske is in no position to squeeze him. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving Hale immunity will make it difficult to successfully prosecute him on 
the loan-fraud charge. But we have to decide which is more important, putting 
Hale away for small-business loan fraud or getting to the bottom of 
Whitewatergate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is more important than the integrity of the process by which a sitting 
President is investigated. If Hale gives exonerating testimony about Clinton 
after Hale is convicted but before he is sentenced, there will be screams of 
bought testimony and coverup. Fiske should not risk the perception of his own 
integrity on such an outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, the public perceives that Fiske squeezed implicating 
testimony out of Hale, it will discredit the entire Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske might contend that he doesn't intend to question Hale until after he is 
sentenced, but this, too, raises questions about Fiske's motives. It permits 
partisans to impugn the credibility of a convicted jailbird who can be 
described as "embittered." 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater allegations are serious. We must get to the bottom of them. If 
a significant percentage of the public comes to the belief that we are governed 
by a crook, cynicism will poison the political system. To maintain public 
confidence in our system as well as confidence in his own integrity, Fiske must 
not jeopardize the credibility of the testimony of a key Whitewater witness by 
putting Hale in the classic prosecutorial squeeze.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; LAGUNA'S LINGERING FIRE TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last fall's devastating fires continue to cause trouble in Laguna Beach, where 
residents pride themselves on their community's rustic character. Now the 
trouble is centered on how fire-resistant new homes should be. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week allowed sentiment to take precedence over safety. 
It unanimously rejected a sensible proposed ordinance to increase the fire 
resistance of new homes built in especially susceptible areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rejected a proposed requirement that fire-resistant or 
non-combustible siding be required in new residential construction close to 
grassy, undeveloped areas. The ordinance also had anti-fire rules governing 
windows and eaves on homes near these so-called "wild land" areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Canyon Acres, an enclave off Laguna Canyon Road that was hard-hit 
by the 1993 blazes, complained of the expense of rebuilding their homes to the 
standards in the ordinance. That concern is understandable, but it should have 
been outweighed by the prospect of making new dwellings as fire-resistant as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also claimed that the proposed requirements would have resulted in 
replacement homes that amounted to "concrete boxes or stucco boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said wood shake and shingle roofs still will be banned from new 
homes, which is good. But in rejecting the other proposals, they lost an 
important opportunity to make a statement about life after last year's 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee that proposed the ordinance included building and Fire 
Department representatives and officials of homeowners associations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that many in the city blamed the fires, which destroyed or damaged 
more than 400 homes, on a lack of firebreaks and water pressure. The attitude 
of complaining homeowners was that the city should fix those problems before 
saddling residents with extra costs. 
</P>
<P>
 To their credit, Laguna Beach officials have tried to cut red tape to speed 
the rebuilding process, but the city also must insist on a greater standard of 
safety.

 John Joseph Molitor, a physician for 36 years and chief of staff of St. Jude 
Medical Center's obstetrics department until his retirement, died Sunday of 
cardiac arrest. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a gentle man, a gifted teacher and a physician who truly epitomized 
the qualities in a physician we would all wish to emulate," the UC Irvine 
obstetrics department said in a released statement. Molitor had served as 
president of Assn. of Volunteer Faculty there until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor was born in Chicago. He received his medical degree from Stritch 
School of Medicine at Loyola University in Chicago, and in 1958 he moved to 
California to begin a private practice. At the same time, he held volunteer 
faculty appointments at USC and UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring from St. Jude last year, he joined the UCI Medical Center as a 
volunteer clinical professor. 
</P>
<P>
 His passion in his spare time was growing fruit, his son Christopher said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has about 20 fruit trees in the back yard," said Christopher Molitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor and his wife, Cynthia, have three daughters and five sons. They are 
Nancy, Susan and Kathleen; and Christopher, John, Daniel, Peter and Joseph. He 
is also survived by a brother, James, and a sister, Joan, both of Fullerton, 
and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass will be celebrated at 7 tonight at St. Juliana's Catholic Church in 
Fullerton. A reception will follow at St. Jude Medical Center at the Sara and 
Robert Erickson Health Education Center. Public graveside services will be held 
at 10 a.m. Friday at Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be sent to the UCI 
Medical Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Attention: Dr. Garite, 
P.O. Box 14091, Orange, CA. 92613-1491 for an annual lectureship on medical 
ethics to be established in honor of Molitor.

 FUN PASTA: Some shoppers, convinced Ralphs and Alpha Beta aren't giving them 
enough variety when it comes to new cuisine, are trying some of the many ethnic 
food markets in Orange County. (OC Live!) The Al Dente Italian Food Mart in Los 
Alamitos, for example, has dozens of pastas and rices not found in standard 
supermarkets. Says a spokeswoman: "Most who come in are just novices who want 
to try something special, usually for a holiday. We get a lot of holiday 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 THE CLAP FLAP: Sometimes freedom of expression depends on who has the gavel. 
In Brea this week, many in the audience heavily applauded resident William Vega 
after he criticized the City Council over controversial redevelopment issues. 
Mayor Pro Tem Bev Perry ordered: "No clapping." . . . But when someone thanked 
the council for support of an 8K race, Perry herself helped lead the applause. 
Angry resident Jim Cook shot back: "Someone compliments you and you clap. 
That's inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
 NEWPORT IMAGE: Anything look familiar in that new black-and-white TV ad for 
Volvo? It was shot near the Newport Pier by famed art photographer Bruce Weber, 
above. It involved a cast of hundreds, mostly bikini-clad. . . . "We recaptured 
what I witnessed in my youth here during spring break," says Joseph Cleary, 
film liaison for the city. "It was the most ambitious commercial production 
ever shot in Orange County." The new ad is supposed to help shed Volvo's image 
of being just a mom-and-dad car. 
</P>
<P>
 TACO TALLY: What do the nation's business leaders eat? John Martin, chief 
executive of Irvine-based Taco Bell, made such a query during a recent speech 
at a forum of top leaders. . . . Their response: 35% admitted eating at a 
fast-food restaurant during the previous week, and 6% admitted eating at Taco 
Bell. But Martin told them: "You've helped prove my point. As successful as 
Taco Bell has become, there's still a lot of eating going on out there that 
we're not part of."

 JIM WHO? Whatever did happen to Jim Malkin, the all-time leading basketball 
scorer at CSUN? Did he make the NBA? Did he star in Europe? Negative. Malkin's 
hoop exploits didn't leave the Valley. Instead, he became a coach and 
administrator, and these days teaches English at Simi High in Simi Valley. . . 
. Tonight, playing his last game, Andre Chevalier needs 29 points to break 
Malkin's 32-year-old record. (C10)

 NOBODY'S PERFECT: All the great dynasties of yesteryear -- the Celtics, 
Yankees, UCLA -- couldn't win every big game. And now it's happened to the 
Chatsworth High girls' soccer team that, until Wednesday, had won championships 
every year since matches began in 1989. . . . Chatsworth was beaten 2-1 by San 
Pedro in overtime. (C12)

 WINTER HEAT: Ron Hammer is no dummy. In November, he moved from Toronto to 
Canoga Park. Sure, he's had to endure the quake, but the last few days have 
demonstrated why so many make a similar voyage. . . . On Wednesday, Hammer 
(above), a minister of the Los Angeles Church of Christ, enjoyed one of his 
favorite hobbies on another unusually hot day. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 NO ENCORE: The spotlight will shine on the Valley again this month, but it 
will be just a little bit dimmer. Last spring, three local teen-agers captured 
top prizes at the annual Music Center Spotlight Awards, which go to the most 
talented young music and dance performers in Southern California. . . . This 
year, however, only two -- Darlene Dirstine of Louisville High and Derek Kwan 
of Agoura Hills High -- advanced to the March 29 finals. 
</P>
<P>
 VALLEY RASCALS: We've always suspected we had our share of rascals, and now we 
have the proof. Four Valley youngsters will appear this summer in the "The 
Little Rascals," a Universal movie based on the popular series of short films. 
. . . The local performers are Blake Collins, Jordan Warkol, Blake Ewing and 
Heather Karasek. Michael Arkush

 NEW HEIGHTS: Amgen Inc., the big biotechnology company, has received thumbs up 
from Thousand Oaks to build its new headquarters in Newbury Park (B4) . . . 
Pleased with the firm's expansion, officials loosened some building 
restrictions, allowing Amgen to construct research labs up to 75 feet tall, 40 
feet higher than is usually allowed ... Imposing though they might be, those 
buildings will still be shorter than the 100-foot tower of the new Civic Arts 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 TOWER TALK: Ojai Valley residents worried about getting cancer from a radar 
tower near their homes will argue their case today on the "Montel Williams 
Show"... Actor Larry Hagman, along with other residents and politicians, will 
face off against the National Weather Service, which built the tower ... 
Weather officials say concerns about cancer-causing radiation are unfounded, 
but residents are confident they made their points: "Watch them crumble under 
the absurdity of their own arguments," said a message on the group's phone hot 
line.

 CULTURAL EVOLUTION: The days when a stuffed two-headed lamb was the main 
attraction at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art are long past 
(Ventura County Life, Page 24). . . The 80-year-old museum is coming into its 
own, recently winning a National Endowment for the Humanities grant . . . 
Officials, including new curator Tim Schiffer, are also considering an 
expansion of the private, nonprofit museum that could buff up its arts image. 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTRY TIME: Come Monday, soft rock is out and country is cool at 
Ventura-based radio station KKUR . . . The station will drop its "adult 
contemporary" format and begin billing itself as "Thunder Country," said 
spokeswoman Lisa Sutherland . . . Officials at KHAY, Ventura County's other 
country music station, said there's room for both in the fast-growing format. 
"Anything that generates a bigger listening audience for country music is 
wonderful," deejay Steve Carr said.

PARENTS' HELP SOUGHT IN CURBING TRUANCY; OXNARD: HUENEME HIGH TAKES DIFFERENT 
APPROACH BY INVOLVING FAMILIES RATHER THAN AUTOMATICALLY LOWERING GRADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by rampant absenteeism, officials at Hueneme High School have joined 
other high schools across Ventura County that are clamping down on students who 
skip class. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the Oxnard school are approaching the problem differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of automatically lowering grades of students who miss a certain number 
of days, as other schools have done in Moorpark, Thousand Oaks and Camarillo, 
Hueneme High is trying to involve parents in getting their children to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers call parents after a student has missed four days of class in a 
nine-week quarter. After six absences, school officials ask parents to school 
for a conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after attempts at parental intervention fail does the school begin meting 
out punishment: Students with 10 unexcused absences are either dropped from the 
class, sent to an alternative school or forced to continue their studies at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to try having this flexibility," Principal Joanne Black said. The 
idea, she said, is "working with them to get them into the mode of coming to 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme High's flexibility in dealing with students who miss classes is in 
sharp contrast with attendance rules at Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa High automatically lowers the grades of students with 10 unexcused 
absences by one letter grade. Those with 15 unexcused absences receive a 
reduction of two letter grades. The only absences that can be excused are for 
funerals of immediate family members or illnesses for which students get doctor 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rio Mesa set its attendance policy last spring, hundreds of students 
walked out of classes in a protest that turned violent when some students broke 
windows and one allegedly shoved a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rio Mesa High's strict rules are working, officials say. The school's 
attendance rate has improved from 94.7% in 1992-93 to 95.3% so far this school 
year. At the same time, however, more students are getting Fs. The percentage 
of failing grades at Rio Mesa rose from 8.4% among all grades to 11.9% after 
the attendance policy was implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa Principal Eric Ortega said the number of A's given at the school has 
also risen, possibly because students who are afraid of having their grades 
lowered are attending classes more regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other high schools in the county also automatically lower the grades of 
students who miss too many classes. 
</P>
<P>
 At Moorpark High School, grades are lowered after a student has five unexcused 
absences in a semester. And at Thousand Oaks High, students who are absent 
without parental permission from a class more than five times in a semester are 
automatically dropped from the course with a failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme High is asking Oxnard Union High School District officials for the 
option of lowering grades of students who have 10 absences. But the school 
would reserve that alternative for students who are concerned about their 
grades, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to half of Hueneme High's 2,200 students miss at least 10 days of school 
during each quarter, which amounts to two weeks of absences for every nine 
weeks of class, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme officials see a problem with automatically lowering the grades of 
truants, Black said: It doesn't work with students who don't care whether they 
make an A, B, C or D. 
</P>
<P>
 But the threat of getting dropped from a course for poor attendance motivates 
most students because they want to graduate, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some students, you could lower their grades all the way down to a D 
and they don't care as long as they're passing," English teacher John Erickson 
said. But all students "are very conscious of how many credits they have and 
how many they have left to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis at Hueneme High, officials said, is not on punishing students who 
miss school, but enlisting parents' help in getting them to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to intervene early enough to have a positive outcome," science 
teacher Mike Vollmert said. Vollmert, Erickson and two other instructors were 
assigned last week to stay after school and meet with parents whose children 
have already had six absences in the second semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Martin Miranda was one of those who met with the teachers' committee. 
</P>
<P>
 With his 14-year-old daughter, Mary, at his side, Miranda explained to the 
teachers that he had not realized his daughter was frequently skipping her 
first-period class. Miranda and his wife are at work in the morning when Mary 
leaves for school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is aware of the problem, Miranda said, he will find a way to make 
sure Mary gets to school before first period starts at 7:25 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to start getting up a lot earlier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mary was the subject of discussion, she said little during the 
meeting and sat with an expressionless look. But as she and her father left the 
meeting, Mary said she was pleased by all the fuss the school was making about 
her poor attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty cool," she said, "because I guess they care."

POINT MUGU RUNWAY PLAN MAY LURE VISITORS, REPORT SAYS; FINANCES: THE NEWS 
SURPRISES MILITARY OFFICIALS. THE NAVY HAS OFFERED TO SHARE ITS FACILITY WITH 
AIRLINES AND CARGO CARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Aviation analysts said Wednesday that development of commercial airline or 
cargo service out of Point Mugu Naval Air Station could annually attract nearly 
half a million members of the Ventura County traveling public. 
</P>
<P>
 News that the proposal could attract so many travelers surprised Navy 
officials and even the analysts themselves, according to Tim Merwin, head 
aviation analyst for the Southern California Assn. of Governments -- the group 
hired to conduct a feasibility study on the joint-use proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy has offered to share its runway with commercial airlines and cargo 
carriers as a way of defraying operating costs at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin said that based on SCAG research, the Point Mugu site would be roughly 
comparable to Palm Springs Regional Airport in numbers of passenger trips and 
numbers of airlines. That Riverside County-based facility is now home to 17 
airlines, which flew more than 400,000 round-trip passengers to the site during 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we digested the data, we were impressed with the chances of success for 
this proposal," Merwin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Further projections, he said, placed the number of possible one-way travelers 
out of Point Mugu at nearly 2 million annually by the year 2010, if current 
passenger and flight restrictions remain at other regional airports that would 
compete with the site's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin presented the information during a meeting of the Point Mugu Airfield 
Joint-Use Investigative Committeeat Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Alan Alpers, a Navy spokesman, the projections supported the 
Navy's contention that a commercial airline service at the base had merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think today's numbers, while still preliminary, would indicate that there's 
interest out there to make this happen," Alpers said. "I think it reinforces 
that our idea to come forth and float this proposal was a worthwhile endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Charlotte Craven, an executive officer on the Point Mugu 
Airfield Investigative Committee and a member of the Camarillo City Council, 
the preliminary SCAG reports lacked a critical sense of whether airline or air 
freight cargo operations would be interested in coming to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that if we don't have that kind of information, we really 
can't make a decision," Craven said. "It seems that once again, we're being 
rushed on this and that we have the cart before the horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven added that without the additional information, the committee could 
waste more money on studies only to find no airline or cargo service is 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could be looking at spending millions on a full environmental impact 
report on this thing before we discover that no one wants to come here," Craven 
said. "And I don't care if it's not our money or the county's money or the 
FAA's money -- it would still be a horrible waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin, however, defended the process saying that the SCAG feasibility report 
-- funded by a $150,000 Federal Aviation Administration grant -- needed to 
profile the traveling public market first before determining industry interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our experience with the airlines is that if you don't have a complete and 
detailed profile of the market ready when you sit down with them, they won't be 
interested -- even if you had the greatest place in the world for a new 
airport," Merwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on airline interest is expected to be contained in Phase II of the 
SCAG study, which is due to be released this summer. Phase I, which will 
contain research on passenger and cargo demand, airport operations, facilities 
and noise and air quality impacts from the project, is due to be released June 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Merwin and Mike Armstrong, another SCAG analyst, presented 
preliminary information to the committee showing that if Point Mugu was 
converted for partial civilian use, local agricultural operations would use the 
facility to move their crops. Armstrong said that as many as 11 planeloads of 
cargo -- each weighing 27 tons per plane -- could fly out of Point Mugu by the 
year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin said the impact of additional flights over noise-sensitive Camarillo -- 
which sits almost directly underneath the base's main flight path -- would not 
be as great as initially thought. He said the majority of commercial flights 
would approach the base from the ocean, but on bad weather days more flights 
would pass over the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that current commuter turboprop service from Oxnard Airport to Los 
Angeles International Airport -- about seven round-trips daily -- would be 
relocated to new facilities at Point Mugu.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea to open Point Mugu to civilian use was presented by Navy officials 
one year ago as a way of cutting maintenance costs of the 11,000-foot runway. 
Navy officials made the offer because a steady decline in number of military 
flights left them with a glut of unused flight time. 
</P>
<P>
 Military operations at the base fell from more than 70,000 annually in 1989 
and 1990 to fewer than 59,000 in 1992, after the departure of a handful of 
squadrons and an overall reduction in weapons testing there.

TIMES PLEDGES $1 MILLION TO CIVIC ARTS PLAZA; ENDOWMENT: NEWSPAPER AND 
FOUNDATION OFFER CASH AND AD SPACE. THE THOUSAND OAKS PROJECT TOPS ITS 
FUND-RAISING GOAL. 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Times and the Times Mirror Foundation on Wednesday announced a 
joint gift of $1 million in cash and advertising space to support the new 
performing arts center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution -- the largest ever pledged to the Civic Arts Plaza -- 
boosted the facility's endowment to nearly $3.5 million, well above the initial 
fund-raising goal of $3 million. Interest generated by the endowment will be 
used to pay for day-to-day costs of running the large auditorium and smaller 
forum theater, which are scheduled to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this (theater) is a delightful and splendid opportunity for this 
region to become part of the world stage, so to speak," said Jeffrey S. Klein, 
president of The Times' Ventura County and San Fernando Valley editions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a marvelous facility," Klein said. "The Times and the Times 
Mirror Foundation want to be a part of this great program." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein received a standing ovation when he presented a check for $100,000 as 
the first installment of the donation during the inaugural meeting of the 
Founders Circle -- a group of donors who have pledged at least $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of the gift, the city will name the Civic Arts Plaza's main 
entryway "The Times Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only say, 'Look out, Times Square, you've been replaced,' " Mayor Elois 
Zeanah quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash portion of the gift will be paid over five years. The free 
advertising space will be available for the next decade, in any section or 
edition of the paper, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising space is "extremely valuable to us because it can be used just as 
if it were cash in the operating budget," said Stephen Woodworth, chairman of 
the Alliance for the Arts fund-raising group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been hoping and dreaming about this gift for a long time, but until 
today, we didn't know it would be a reality," said Tom Mitze, executive 
director of the 1,800-seat auditorium and 400-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 A significant chunk of the advertising space would be used to promote the 
grand opening, a black-tie gala event in mid-October, Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they celebrated the $1-million gift during a luncheon at the Lake 
Sherwood Country Club, fund-raisers said there is still a need to pick up even 
more donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Larry Janss, who sits on the theater commission responsible for 
running the performing arts center, immediately challenged his colleagues to 
set a new target, now that the original $3-million goal has been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good is a goal if it's been met?" Janss asked. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged fund-raisers to aim for at least a $10-million endowment, which could 
subsidize performances in addition to covering operating costs.

 While they did not explicitly endorse Janss' proposal, leaders of the Alliance 
for the Arts fund-raising campaign vowed to continue their effort. Several 
individuals and business representatives attending Wednesday's lunch said they 
were mulling major contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll encourage you, and we'll also twist your arm," said fund-raiser and 
attorney Chuck Cohen. "Fund-raising is not only a diplomatic art, but also a 
very direct martial art."

COMMITTEE PICKS ITEMS TO SPRUCE UP DOWNTOWN; VENTURA: COUNCIL PANEL HAMMERS OUT 
SUCH DETAILS AS COLORS AND TREES. THE CITY HAS ALLOCATED AT LEAST $2.3 MILLION 
FOR THE REVITALIZATION.

 After years of talk about sprucing up downtown Ventura, the pace of 
revitalization picked up Wednesday as city leaders decided such nitty-gritty 
details as the trees, bus benches, lampposts and landscaping that will change 
the district's look dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The face lift of the city's old commercial center, which will start to take 
shape this summer, will target Main, Figueroa and California streets first, as 
well as the Amtrak train station near the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But long-term plans call for the entire downtown to be changed in the coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 After a drought-related moratorium that restricted building and a recession 
that put an extra brake on economic activity, city officials say they are 
thrilled that the pace of downtown revitalization is picking up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finally doing it," Community Development Director Everett Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most visible signs of activity is the two-story, 30,000-square-foot 
courthouse under construction for the 2nd District Court of Appeal at Figueroa 
and Santa Clara streets. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of June, Main Street will have new trees, bus benches and street 
signs. And this summer, a new restaurant and shops are planned at the foot of 
California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has allocated at least $2.3 million through 1998 for the 
area, and members consider the project a top priority. In recent months, 
developers have also been coming forward with proposals for building 
restaurants, offices and housing downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council subcommittee Wednesday approved yanking out New Zealand 
Christmas trees that line Main Street and planting palm trees. The faded wooden 
beams that provide shade for Main Street crosswalks will be knocked down and 
replaced by planters filled with flowers. Bus benches with peeling paint will 
give way to concrete benches with a terra-cotta finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other cosmetic changes on Main Street between Fir and Figueroa streets include 
junking the plain aluminum trash cans and replacing them with receptacles 
finished in terra cotta, to match the bus benches. Dark green signs with a logo 
of San Buenaventura Mission will replace the drab brown street signs on Main 
Street, and signals and lampposts will be painted dark green to match. 
</P>
<P>
 On Figueroa Street between Santa Clara Street and the Ventura Freeway, curbs, 
gutters and asphalt will be ripped up and redesigned. Figueroa will be 
narrowed, and sidewalks will be decorated with black, Victorian-style 
lampposts. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few trees line Figueroa, and they will be uprooted and replaced by a 
row of 20-foot palm trees on both sides of the street. The area will have a 
Victorian-style theme to complement the new courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Amtrak station, two shade structures will be added as well as an 
information kiosk, and about 25 palm trees will be planted. 
</P>
<P>
 California Street will be redesigned in the spring, and construction there is 
scheduled for December. A 10,000-square-foot plaza near the Holiday Inn will be 
refurbished, and new palm trees will line the street from City Hall to the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders said they are happy to be completing details on a long-awaited 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, council members Gregory L. Carson, Gary Tuttle and Rosa Lee 
Measures examined pictures of different types of palm trees, leafed through 
catalogues looking for new bus benches and debated the merits of various 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why ivy geraniums for the planters?" Carson asked city staff. "They look good 
for a few years, but then they start looking crummy." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, who owns a nursery, guided most of the discussion on palm trees and 
geraniums. He persuaded Tuttle and Measures to approve Cocus plumosa , or Queen 
palm trees, for California Street instead of Washingtonia robustus , or Mexican 
fan palm trees. He and Measures recommended drought-resistant plants instead of 
ivy geraniums for planters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like planning and building a house, and you finally get to choose what 
color to paint it," Carson said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the faster pace of revitalization is possible because of 
the council's approval in July of a Downtown Specific Plan, a regulatory 
document that outlines a strategy for revamping the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last three to five years, nothing was going on in downtown," said Pat 
Richardson, project manager. "Up to now, we couldn't do anything because there 
wasn't a direction for what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Revitalizing downtown will be one of the most ambitious endeavors the city has 
undertaken. In its golden era during the 1940s, the downtown attracted 
thousands of residents throughout the county to theaters, businesses and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is home to secondhand furniture outlets, thrift stores and budget 
motels. It has one of the highest concentrations of homeless people in the 
city, and police say a handful of prostitutes frequent the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they plan to increase police foot patrols to discourage 
panhandling and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Several high-profile downtown projects are expected to start soon: 
</P>
<P>
 * A restaurant and retail operation is planned at the end of California 
Street, on the beach Promenade. The council this week approved a 10-year lease 
with three local businessmen who hope to have a restaurant and shops ready this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fate of the city-owned Peirano Building, a historic landmark across from 
the mission on Main Street, will be decided soon. A developer wants to build a 
courtyard, restaurant and shops there, while art activists want a municipal 
gallery. Next week, the council is scheduled to choose between the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 * A development at the northwest corner of Thompson Boulevard and Figueroa 
Street, near the courthouse. In two weeks, a council subcommittee is scheduled 
to choose between an office or condominium project for the vacant lot.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CHANNEL ISLANDS; NAVY EXPECTS PERMIT FOR UNDERWATER 
TESTS 
</P>

 Navy officials said they expect to receive a permit today authorizing them to 
start a program that involves detonating underwater explosives to test warship 
hulls and electronics in the sealife-rich waters west of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though they are scheduled to take possession of the National Marine 
Fisheries Service's Letter of Authorization -- which will allow them to 
detonate underwater explosives as large as 10,000 pounds -- Navy officials said 
the "ship-shock" trials are not scheduled to begin until early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said the service agreed to that date, proposed by a national 
environmental group, in part because it will take nearly a month to set up the 
elaborate tests in the designated area, 65 miles west of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing program, which authorizes an "incidental take" of sea mammals -- 
some of which are listed as federally endangered -- has prompted a firestorm of 
protests by local and national environmental activists. J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE DISTRICT PREPARING FOR CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a projected budget shortfall of $1.8 million this spring, officials 
at the Ventura County Community College District say they may have to cut 
part-time non-teaching staff, slash nonessential funds such as supply budgets 
and even dig into district reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators will prepare a number of budget-cutting options this 
month and trustees will choose among them at the district's April board 
meeting, said Jeff Marsee, the district's vice chancellor for administrative 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had set aside $500,000 last year in anticipation that spring 
state funding allotments would be cut when property tax revenues came in under 
state projections. But administrators learned this week that that amount would 
not be enough to cover the more likely shortfall of $1.4 million projected by 
state finance officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The district faces an additional loss of $400,000 in enrollment funds that 
state officials pledged but now cannot provide, bringing the total shortfall to 
$1.8 million, college officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, district administrators projected a $972,000 shortfall in property 
tax revenues, but they revised that number Monday when they received new 
information from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's $500,000 reserve will cover part of the shortfall, as will a 
one-time $600,000 health-insurance premium refund, Marsee said. The remaining 
money, approximately $700,000, will have to come from the $63-million 1993-94 
budget or from reserves, he said. Currently, the district holds about $2.5 
million in its reserves, but about $1.5 million of that is obligated to various 
funds which the district cannot draw on, Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district only recently built up its reserves to the state chancellor's 
minimum level, allowing the district to get off the state chancellor's watch 
list for the first time in years. If the district cuts into its reserves, it 
could again be placed on the watch list. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGES WON'T MEET ACCESS REQUIREMENT

<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District will not meet requirements of 
the federal Americans With Disabilities Act even if it gets the $1.6 million in 
state money it is seeking to make its colleges more accessible to people with 
handicaps, district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators designed their accessibility project four years ago, 
before the federal government released ADA guidelines, said Gil Putnam, the 
district's director of facility planning.With the help of handicapped students, 
college officials toured the Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura campuses to determine 
what improvements the district needed. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are considering final funding approval for the project, Putnam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, the project will be completed in about a year, and 
Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges will have new wheelchair ramps, railings, 
elevators and automatic doors, among the many improvements planned, said Robert 
Coles, an architect with the Ventura firm that designed the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will come from voter-approved state bonds, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coles said he hoped that within the next few years, the state chancellor's 
office will approve more funds to bring the district up to ADA requirements, 
allowing officials to install improvements such as increased access to some 
staff areas and handicapped-accessible library stacks. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; OXNARD MAN HIT BY TRAIN IS LISTED AS 
CRITICAL 
</P>

<P>
 A 71-year-old man was critically injured Wednesday when he was struck by a 
train in Ventura near the spot where he was found lying on a freeway shoulder 
the day before, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 LeRoy McClary, who lives in Oxnard, was stretched out with his head resting on 
the Southern-Pacific railroad tracks near California Street when he apparently 
was hit by the outer edge of a train wheel about 11:15 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Officer Russ Robinson said he found McClary semiconscious and 
bleeding from a five- to seven-inch cut on his head. Beside him lay a gym bag 
full of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He moved a little and at one point he tried to say something, but it was 
unintelligible," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 An engineer on the train told police it was too late to stop by the time 
McClary was spotted beside the tracks in a shady area under a freeway entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 McClary was taken to the Ventura County Medical Center where he was listed in 
critical condition with multiple injuries late Wednesday. Ventura City Fire 
Capt. Paul Masiel said McClary underwent brain scans to determine the extent of 
his head wound. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, just before 2 p.m., a Highway Patrol officer found McClary lying 
in the shoulder of the southbound Ventura Freeway near the California Street 
underpass. A CHP officer took the man back to a CHP station where he was picked 
up by someone from the Oxnard group home where he lives, said Ventura Police 
Lt. Don Arth. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LEVY BANCORP LOSES $5.7 MILLION IN '93 
</P>

<P>
 Levy Bancorp, the Ventura-based parent company of the Bank of A. Levy, on 
Wednesday reported a net loss of $5.7 million for 1993, capping a year of 
financial troubles for the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Under order by federal regulators since July to improve its loan portfolio, 
Levy Bancorp struggled through last year with a heavy load of bad real estate 
loans.Financial problems peaked in the second quarter, when the bank lost $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Levy Bancorp lost $440,000 in the third quarter and $981,000 for 
the fourth quarter. By comparison, the bank lost $921,000 in all of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank President Marshall Milligan said the bank continues to reduce its number 
of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, 1993 has been a very productive year in terms of reducing problem 
loans and making steady progress toward resumption of profits and dividends," 
Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem loans have forced the bank to bolster its reserves. The company's 
loan loss reserve as of Dec. 31, 1993, stood at $10.3 million, representing 
3.05% of total loans. At the beginning of last year, Levy Bancorp had $10.8 
million in reserve, representing 2.35% of the bank's total loans. CONSTANCE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; INSTRUCTOR AT ROSE IS TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 20 years, Oxnard elementary schoolteacher Lydia Cruz-Machlitt has gotten 
up in the morning with fresh enthusiasm for another working day.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like helping a new generation learn and knowing that I am part of their 
future," Cruz-Machlitt said. "I still wake up in the morning looking forward to 
teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the 40-year-old Rose Avenue School teacher is celebrating her 20th 
year of teaching with the title Tri-County 1994 Teacher of the Year for gifted 
and talented students. She was selected from more than 50 nominees for her work 
in bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Gosfield, a spokeswoman for the California Assn. for the Gifted, said 
that in addition to her teaching duties, Cruz-Machlitt provides workshops 
throughout the state in bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Puerto Rico, Cruz-Machlitt has been teaching elementary school in 
Oxnard since 1980. In the past five years, she has been teaching second- and 
third-graders in the Gifted and Talented Education program. Most of her 
students are bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents see her not only as a teacher but as a friend who is available when 
they need help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having a lot of problems with each of my children and Lydia took the 
time to talk to me about those problems," said Yoshiko Iwamoto, 38, the mother 
of three students who all have had Cruz-Machlitt as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mother, Benita Sandoval, 39, whose two children took classes with 
Cruz-Machlitt, said the teacher can be a close friend to the students and 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children improved greatly with her," Sandoval said, "and she always treats 
the kids and the parents like friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Involving parents in the education of their children is one of Cruz-Machlitt's 
greatest abilities, said Dennis Johnson, Rose Avenue's principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a pleasant, kind of magnetic charismatic personality which draws 
parents into the program," Johnson said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PIRU; RIVER OIL SPILL CLEANUP COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Fish and Game on Wednesday declared clean the 
173,000-gallon oil spill that drained into the Santa Clara River near Piru 
after a pipeline cracked during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup took more than 600 workers six weeks to complete and cost more 
than $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game Capt. Roger Reese said the Arco-owned Four Corners Pipe 
Line Co. did a good job responding to the spill, which polluted more than 12 
miles of the Santa Clara River and threatened its sensitive wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a damage assessment, but we won't know the results of that for 
some time," Reese said. Company officials said the spill had a minimal effect 
on plants and animals living in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Taft-based oil company responsible for the McGrath Lake oil 
spill issued another report to state water officials. But like others written 
by Berry Petroleum, it fails to address the cause of the spill, discovered Dec. 
25 near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Regional Water Quality Control Board said Wednesday that it 
is not unusual for companies responsible for oil spills to delay releasing 
relevant information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say this is typical of the kind of response we get," said Michael 
Lyons, who heads the surveillance unit of the water quality control board in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company responsible for its spill tends to present information in as 
concise a form as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-page report addresses six specific questions asked by the water agency 
on Feb. 1, including what caused the spill and what measures were taken to 
prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berry Petroleum said Monday it still does not know how 84,000 gallons of 
thick crude oil was released into the environmentally sensitive McGrath Lake 
wetlands over three days. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY TO EXPERIENCE LOWER TEMPERATURES

<P>
 Ventura County is expected to cool off today after unseasonably warm weather 
earlier in the week, the National Weather Service said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooling trend began Wednesday as ocean breezes picked up at midday, 
keeping local temperatures in the low 80s, said Bruce Entwistle, a 
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only (temperature) records we had in Southern California were in Los 
Angeles," Entwistle said. "The temperatures in Ventura actually started to fall 
at midday with the light onshore flow of wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures are expected to drop to more seasonable levels over the next five 
days as morning fog and patchy clouds move into the area, Entwistle said. 
</P>
<P>
 No rain is forecast over the next five days, he said. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY; ARTS GROUP LEADER STEPPING DOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year as head of a Simi Valley arts group that runs a small city-owned 
theater, Acting President Bill Appleton is stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
 Appleton, 46, has informed the board of the Simi Valley Cultural Assn. that he 
is leaving the group to spend more time with his wife and three children, ages 
11 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like with a lot of volunteer organizations, you find the more you give to 
them the more they demand," Appleton said. "You get to the point where you take 
a look and say, 'My God, I'm never home and I never do anything with my 
family.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Appleton, who works as a video and still photographer at GTE in Westlake 
Village, said his resignation marks the end of his work with the association. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the type of person that when somebody wants me to do something, it's 
really hard to say no," Appleton said. "It wouldn't work for me to just try to 
cut back. I really have to cut the whole thing off." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Appleton's leadership of the association, the city agreed to waive the 
monthly fee it charged the group to lease a 90-seat theater near the Police 
Department, enabling the association to put its profits back into the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the deepest respect for Bill and his commitment in everything that he 
undertook," board member Irene Silbert said. "He did quite a lot to help our 
relationship with the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Appleton will be replaced by Acting Vice President Jan Glasband, 42, a 
commercial graphic artist who joined the association a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasband will serve as acting president until the association holds elections 
in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our immediate goal is to continue to work together to increase interest in 
the arts in Simi Valley," Glasband said. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS; LIBRARY'S REOPENING DELAYED UNTIL 
APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The long-awaited reopening of the Thousand Oaks Library will be delayed until 
April because of unexpected difficulties in preparing the floor for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even 2 1/2 months after the Northridge earthquake caused $2 million in damage 
to the library, it remains unsafe because of an uneven floor surface, City 
Manager Grant Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bumpy remnants of mastic, a substance used to stick the carpet to the 
floor, must be completely removed before the public can walk in the library 
without fear of tripping, Brimhall said. Although contractors are working 
14-hour days to clear away the mastic, total cleanup could take two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only three contractors in the state have the equipment to remove the mastic," 
Brimhall said. "We could do it chemically, but then the building might 
explode." 
</P>
<P>
 After the mastic is removed, other repairs will be tackled. The library should 
be open by early to mid-April, Brimhall said. He promised to let readers in "as 
soon as possible, when the public will not be at any peril." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving ahead with other repairs while work on the mastic continues, the 
Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday unanimously selected the Westlake Village 
firm of Amador-Whittle Architects to draw up blueprints for a new ceiling. The 
old, metal ceiling crashed to the floor in hundreds of pieces in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Amador-Whittle also will manage other aspects of the library's rehabilitation, 
including checking to be sure the building complies with current codes and 
working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to secure federal funds.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY; DISASTER AID CENTER MOVES TO NEW 
OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six weeks after the Northridge earthquake, the multi-agency Disaster 
Assistance Center in Simi Valley moved Wednesday to more permanent quarters on 
the west end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency closed the makeshift headquarters for 
earthquake aid at a park district community center Tuesday night and reopened 
Wednesday afternoon in a 15,000-square-foot office space at 59 W. Tierra Rejada 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "By (Tuesday) afternoon, we'd taken 6,846 applications for aid," and the 
number of new cases began leveling off some time ago, said Eugene Brezany, a 
FEMA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster center will remain in its new location for at least six months 
and possibly longer, said Brezany. The center appeared busy Wednesday afternoon 
as several dozen people filed claims with agencies ranging from the federal 
Department of Housing and Urban Development to the California Employment 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the temporary aid center set up at Sycamore Drive Community Center 
after the Jan. 17 earthquake, the new center is wired into FEMA's computer so 
aid workers can have direct access to quake victims' claim records, Brezany 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of checking the process of their claims by phone, as they had to do 
earlier, the applicants can sit down face to face with disaster workers and get 
quick answers to their questions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District officials were glad to 
regain use of the all-purpose room that the disaster center had occupied since 
the week of the earthquake, said Rick Johnson, a district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the recreation classes normally held there were lost to 
cancellations or rescheduling because of the disaster center, depriving the 
district of a large source of income, he said. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS; CHILDREN'S MUSEUM IDEA TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a petition signed by 3,000 residents, Thousand Oaks council 
members have directed city staff members to explore the feasibility of building 
a children's museum in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And a committee already formed to seek possible sites for a Native Peoples 
Center should examine the concept of a children's museum as well, council 
members decided on a 5-0 vote Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had proposed building a children's museum near the Civic Arts Plaza, 
but the committee will look into other sites as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll give it a shot," promised Councilman Frank Schillo, who sits on the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision elated Hope Colt Mette, a Thousand Oaks resident who organized 
the petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, families really need constructive things to do together," she told the 
council. "We call it a children's museum, but it's really a family museum. You 
can dress up like firemen, crawl through a life-size ant farm and find out what 
it's like to be a kid again." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar agreed, calling her own visits to children's museums 
with her family "a real treat." But she warned Mette and other residents that 
the city would not be able to fund a museum and would only consider proposals 
with substantial financial backing. STEPHANIE SIMON

THOUSAND OAKS OVERRULES PLANNERS, OKS AMGEN'S EXPANSION; BUSINESS: 
BIOTECHNOLOGY GIANT PROVIDES 13% OF CITY'S JOBS. COUNCIL ENDORSES A DEVELOPMENT 
PLAN TO MAKE ROOM FOR 6,300 NEW WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. is free to expand its world headquarters with 
minimal municipal meddling, as the Thousand Oaks City Council has approved the 
firm's ambitious plan to build a high-tech corporate campus for thousands of 
new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing several Planning Commission decisions, the council on Tuesday 
endorsed Amgen's proposal to make room for 6,300 new workers over the next 
quarter of a century by building offices, warehouses, manufacturing plants and 
research labs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-0 vote clears the way for Amgen to build swiftly on its 100-acre campus 
in the Rancho Conejo Industrial Park. The expansion will cost $785 million for 
construction alone, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's vote late Tuesday allows Amgen to construct labs 75 feet high -- 
the tallest private development in a city that has long prided itself on 
protecting mountain views.  
</P>
<P>
 In another unprecedented decision, the council exempted Amgen from the 
traditional permit process, allowing the Newbury Park firm to develop some 
buildings without holding public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski abstained from voting because her husband works 
for Amgen. But the other four council members lavished praise on Amgen for 
bringing so many high-paying, non-polluting jobs into the community. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that other high-flying companies have left California, seeking 
better tax breaks or cheaper real estate. In contrast, they said, Amgen 
officials have always expressed a desire to remain in Thousand Oaks, where the 
biotechnology firm was founded in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amgen provides 13% of the jobs in our city now," Mayor Elois Zeanah said. 
"They could have come to this council and held us hostage. But they didn't. To 
Amgen, we want to say: 'Thank you. You're first-class and we're lucky to have 
you here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the concept of creating three building-height zones on 
Amgen's 100-acre campus. Buildings on the fringe, closest to public streets and 
private residences, would adhere to the city's general 35-foot height limit. 
But facilities tucked inside the complex could range to 55 feet, or even 75 
feet in the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 In all three zones, a building's height would be determined by averaging the 
height of each of its walls. Under this system, one wing of a building could 
exceed the stipulated height limit, as long as another wing came in under the 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission had sought to impose an absolute limit on building 
height and to forbid any one wall from poking above that cap. Amgen, however, 
denounced that formula as "unworkable," and the council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Siding with Amgen on other controversial issues as well, the council voted to 
allow the company to obtain permits for its buildings in the 75-foot zone 
without going through the lengthy public hearing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the company will simply present its plans to the city's planning 
department for an "over-the-counter" approval. Neither Amgen nor the council 
will have the right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the council agreed to grant Amgen a "fudge factor" to allow 
flexibility in design. This rare provision allows Amgen to deviate, by 5%, from 
the development standards approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5% variance applies to building height, setbacks from curbs, driveway 
width, number of parking spaces, size of signs and other aspects of the 
development. But Amgen executive Ed Bjurstrom promised not to use the fudge 
factor to increase building height in the 75-foot zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's swift 4-0 vote in favor of Amgen came after a dozen public 
speakers had implored the city to treat the world's largest biotechnology 
company as a vital community asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that all 35 residents who signed up to speak and all 207 who submitted 
written statement cards indicated support for Amgen, Zeanah asked her 
colleagues whether they needed to hear more testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 To the cheers of the overflow crowd, including at least 100 Amgen employees, 
the council members all said they were ready to approve the biotechnology 
firm's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely amazing that here we have a project that varies, in some 
respects from our building height and setback requirements, and there is not 
one person here in opposition," said Councilman Alex Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 In his nearly 30 years on the council, Fiore said, "it's never happened 
before." Jokingly comparing the unanimous support of Amgen's tall buildings 
with the continuing dissension about the Civic Arts Plaza's tower, Fiore added: 
"I think we put the Civic Arts Plaza in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, dozens of residents swarmed around a broadly grinning 
Bjurstrom, Amgen's director of engineering and construction. Like a 
well-connected host greeting guests in a reception line, Bjurstrom shook hand 
after hand and slapped back after back. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting the unanimous verdict did not surprise him, Bjurstrom said simply: 
"I had high hopes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 2 1/2-hour hearing, scores of Amgen employees camped out in the 
snack room adjacent to the packed council chambers. Squashed next to microwaves 
and coffee machines, swigging milk and downing chocolate bars, they applauded 
raucously as strangers lavished praise on their company. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 2,000 employees, Amgen is the city's largest employer, edging 
out General Telephone Co. and the Conejo Valley Unified School District. The 
biotechnology firm, which manufactures drugs to help kidney dialysis and 
chemotherapy patients, reported revenues last year of $1.4 billion.

FAST-TRACKING OF CITY PROJECTS IS DEFENDED; THOUSAND OAKS: COUNCIL REJECTS A 
REQUEST TO SEND ALL PUBLIC DEVELOPMENTS TO PLANNING COMMISSION FOR REVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angrily defending the practice of fast-tracking city projects, Thousand Oaks' 
ruling majority has rejected a request by Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski to submit 
all public developments to Planning Commission scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 On the theory that public buildings, such as the library and youth center, are 
usually one-of-a-kind, the City Council has traditionally taken full control of 
the projects' design and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sending the blueprints to the Planning Commission for review, the 
council has taken charge of the projects from start to finish, gathering 
citizen input through informal town meetings and holding a single public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski has argued that such a system is unfair because private developers 
must submit to a lengthy permit process, including a Planning Commission 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstering her position with documents during a heated half-hour debate 
Tuesday night, Zukowski cited a line from the city's legally binding General 
Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Review of the architectural treatment of a proposed public building should be 
carried out in a manner similar to that used for private structures," she read. 
"This will probably involve evaluation by the staff with Planning Commission or 
City Council referral of selected buildings to an advisory committee." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, council members Judy Lazar, Frank Schillo and Alex Fiore said 
they felt confident that all public projects receive adequate review from both 
experts and residents, even without Planning Commission hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 They pointed out that only the council has the authority to waive Thousand 
Oaks' stringent design standards, and to approve the unique architecture, 
colors or landscaping that make public buildings special. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission judges projects based strictly on their adherence to 
city codes, and would be automatically obligated to turn down most public 
developments, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public buildings, by their nature, are going to look different, and are not 
going to fit into our codes," which were designed for strip malls and tract 
homes, Schillo said. "Public buildings are not going to be a box with two 
stories and a flat roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore agreed, saying: "We have a process that has served us well over the 
years. Frankly, I don't want to delegate these projects to the Planning 
Commission." But Zukowski, backed by Mayor Elois Zeanah, suggested that 
Planning Commission review could have picked up some flaws in the design of 
existing public projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said, the commissioners may have questioned whether the 
five-story garage contained enough parking spaces for the Civic Arts Plaza. Now 
that the complex is near completion, city officials have conceded that the 
garage will not provide enough room for cars during sold-out performances at 
the 1,800-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "In future public projects, (we should) absolutely do what is required of the 
private sector," Zukowski said. "It's just a safeguard, to be sure that we're 
not put in the position of judging something without adequate information and 
input."

 Simi Valley homeowners, worried that shifting ground beneath their houses will 
make their neighborhoods particularly unsafe during an earthquake, have asked 
the city to fund a study of soil stability in the city's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 residents packed a meeting at the offices of the Simi 
Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors Tuesday night to express their concerns. 
About 250 homeowners filled out forms requesting that the city pay for the 
geological survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident C. Jill Clark, who led the meeting, said she would bring the group's 
requests to the City Council at its Monday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a realtor whose home on Sabina Circle was severely damaged in the Jan. 
17 earthquake, charged during a two-hour speech that the city is jeopardizing 
the lives of its residents by allowing reconstruction in areas where the ground 
shifted and cracked during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's lives and property are on the line," Clark said. "We deserve a 
better response from the city." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Greg Stratton on Wednesday said the city would not be willing to 
fund such a study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is not responsible for personal property loss from the earthquake," 
Stratton said. "It would be like going in and using taxpayer dollars to have 
people's chimneys repaired." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday agreed to ask the state's Division of Mines and 
Geology to conduct a study of the soil under public roads in two quake-damaged 
strips surrounding the Arroyo Simi, from Katherine to Stow streets and from 
Yosemite Avenue to Kuehner Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clark said she was not satisfied with that response and is demanding that 
the city pay for an extensive study of a large area on the eastern end of the 
city, south of Los Angeles Avenue and east of Stearns Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a study of the entire area, including the soil under our homes," 
Clark said. "We deserve to put our lives back together and without such a study 
this will not be possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who attended the Tuesday night meeting agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city should tell us if the soil is any good," resident Dolores Pacheco 
said. "I want to know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Karen Menge concurred: "We need to know if it's worth it to repair 
your home, abandon it, or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb, who attended the forum, suggested that homeowners 
hire a contractor to work with state geologists to study the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of fighting each other, we should be working together," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also accused the city of delaying for more than two weeks the release of 
a Feb. 7 report from state geologists who toured the damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior City Planner Michael Kuhn said the report had to be examined by several 
city departments before it could be released. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an elaborate review process here and we wanted to make sure the 
report was checked for accuracy," Kuhn said. "We went through the normal review 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn also said the two-page report merely reaffirmed information the city had 
already provided its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which was released Friday, said ground ruptures at the east end of 
the city were caused by liquefaction and ground shaking, that residents should 
wait to repair cracked foundations because more settling may be caused by 
aftershocks and rain, and residents planning to reconstruct their homes should 
consider hiring soil or structural engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, quake damage is estimated at nearly $350 million, much of that to 
residences and businesses on the city's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn said requests from homeowners who want to rebuild are considered on an 
individual basis. Homeowners must apply to the city for reconstruction permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they need a soil study, we will not allow them to rebuild until they have 
one done," Kuhn said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he received calls on Wednesday from several homeowners who were 
concerned that Clark's claims would devalue their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is running around telling everybody that this massive area is slipping 
away," Stratton said. "She's putting a cloud over a lot of property."

A BIG THANKS TO LAPD'S OTHER HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We are writing to praise the unsung heroes of the Los Angeles Police 
Department, the ones behind the officers: the wives, husbands, boyfriends, 
girlfriends, mothers and fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earthquake Jan. 17, I was at home. I am a family man, as a lot of 
our officers are, and was extremely scared for my family and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next two hours, I made sure my family was OK. Many of us drove to 
our relatives to ensure their safety. I made paths in my home so my wife and 
kids could walk from room to room. I broke out the flashlights and barbecue 
(for cooking), turned off the gas and got my family in order as best I could. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6:45 a.m., my wife looked at me and said, "You have to go to work, don't 
you?" I felt hopeless when I answered, "Yeah, I'm sorry, but I have to go." As 
I dressed, I felt helpless about leaving my family. I worked that day for 12 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 I could see the strain building up in my "hero" after a few days. She would 
say, "You are going to work and are not the one who has to stay with the kids 
without electricity or gas to cook." I was proud to call her my wife and was 
grateful that she was strong enough to see this through -- as our many heroes 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 We would like to thank the officers of the Los Angeles Police Department who 
responded to the call of duty and performed in an outstanding and professional 
manner, regardless of the fact that they have not had a pay raise or a 
cost-of-living increase in the past two years. To all of them, thank you for a 
job well done.

COMPASSIONATE 'HELPERS' LAUDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Everyone who helped the Northridge Meadows tenants retrieve their belongings 
deserves thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers, rescue workers, firefighters, National Guard and police were 
all wonderful! They really seemed to care what was happening to each of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers and rescue workers went out of their way to help us get as much as 
we could. It was very difficult for some of us to see anything but destruction 
in the apartments. Having their compassionate eyes was a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people who were only able to get into their apartments by way of the 
firefighters were very grateful for anything they could get. The firefighters 
were terrific! They went above and beyond the little lists some people gave 
them. They would see something they thought would be important and went for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The police and National Guard protected our belongings. Had they not been 
there, some of us may not have had anything to take out of the building. They 
were also compassionate, asking if they could help and how we were holding up. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of the Northridge Methodist Church went above and beyond. They 
tried to keep up with all the news and let each tenant that called know as much 
as they could. They came through when the tenants were beginning to feel 
everything was lost. They were our lifeline! 
</P>
<P>
 Under what started out to be very difficult circumstances, everyone pulled 
together and made things as easy as possible. I have great respect for everyone 
that helped.

ENCINO PARK GROUP LAUDS REPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Encino Park Improvement Committee appreciates your reporting (Feb. 10) 
on how neighbors on two blocks in Encino Park helped one another after the Jan. 
17 earthquake and why our homes survived so well. 
</P>
<P>
 EPIC has been active in reducing crime since its founding in 1980, and 
introduced tract-wide Neighborhood Watch in 1990.We relinquished it and our 
emergency response network in 1992 to others who wanted to administer them 
tract-wide. Nonetheless, we got many calls after the earthquake from residents 
requesting help, and we provided it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major EPIC efforts include working to save our tract from exploitation 
by apartment developers since our shopping center was torn out in 1980, 
distributing questionnaires for tract-wide votes on community issues such as 
rapid transit, holding a time-consuming and costly beautification awards 
program in 1992 and having a get-out-the-vote campaign in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has reported most of this. Thank you. Your help has been invaluable 
and shows the importance of a newspaper that supports the community as your 
Valley Edition does.

VARIOUS DWP CREWS PRAISED FOR SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Employees of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power provided 
outstanding service during the days following the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A widespread area of the San Fernando Valley received massive damage, and the 
DWP also suffered major damage to its facilities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Jan. 17, employees of the Granada Hills Service Center 
reported for work almost immediately, leaving their own families and homes, to 
help repair and restore the electrical system, some of which had sustained 
substantial damage. The employees began to clean up and organize the yard and 
offices, which also did not have power (for two days) or water (for four days). 
</P>
<P>
 The field crews, including electrical craft and tree-trimming personnel, were 
out repairing the electrical system by midmorning and continued to work until 
late Monday night without access to food or water. These crews were supported 
by the warehouse and administrative employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The field crews worked 12 to 16 hours a day for two weeks following the 
earthquake. The Granada Hills Service Center crews were supported by crews from 
their sister service centers in the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the employees sacrificed time away from their families and put their 
personal business on hold until the public had electricity restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the extended work hours and the severe traffic problems, employees 
living in outlying areas opted to remain on-site in makeshift sleeping 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these jobs are not high profile or glamorous, they are extremely 
dangerous. Their function affects each one of us every day and in the face of 
disaster. These employees were responsive, organized and professional during 
these chaotic times. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has been very supportive, and this support has lifted the crews' 
spirit. When the list of heroes of the recovery from the earthquake is 
compiled, these dedicated DWP employees should be at the top.

ACHIEVE BALANCE OF JUSTICE, COMPASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We need to use both our heads and our hearts when confronting the issue of 
disaster relief to illegal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many of those who have spoken publicly on this issue have 
failed to achieve a proper balance between justice and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States as a sovereign nation not only has the right but the duty to 
control our borders. It is nonsense to call for housing and housing assistance, 
as distinguished from temporary shelter, for those who are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is appropriate in a time of disaster to provide in addition to 
temporary shelter the following: emergency medical care, water, food and 
stopgap clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are here illegally should be treated humanely, but they should still 
be subject to deportation hearings. There is nothing stopping any charity, 
person or religious group from providing permanent housing for such persons in 
the countries to which they should be returned.

<P>
 * If you can stand one more earthquake story, here's one that will make the 
postal system jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone else on Jan. 17, we tried our best to ride out the shaking with 
as much courage as we could muster.After the initial quake, we crept through 
our still moaning house, falling over debris and feeling our way in the dark 
and newly unfamiliar surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing full well that a slew of aftershocks was going to hit, we made our way 
out the front door and into our driveway, where we saw all of our neighbors had 
done the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have been no more than five minutes after we had been so rudely 
awakened when a car with its headlights on turned into our cul-de-sac. Who 
could it be? No one recognized the car. As it crept closer, the headlights 
growing brighter, an object came flying out of the window. Plop. It was the Los 
Angeles Times being delivered to our house. 
</P>
<P>
 Your ad campaign should probably be "Forget the sleet and snow. We do 
earthquakes!"

COUNTY / IN BRIEF; LOS ANGELES; OFFICERS IN GUNPLAY CASE ARE CHARGED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The district attorney's office -- rejecting a contention by two Los Angeles 
police officers that they were not firing at a highway patrolman during a 
freeway shooting incident last month -- filed felony charges against them on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Ted S. Teyechea and Michael V. Herrera are scheduled for arraignment 
today on two counts each of assaulting a peace officer and shooting from a 
moving pickup truck at Scott Wall, a California Highway Patrol motorcycle 
officer who was parked on an on-ramp shoulder issuing a traffic ticket.Wall was 
not injured.  
</P>
<P>
 Teyechea and Herrera also were charged with firing with gross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all counts, the officers face maximum sentences of about 14 
years. They are free on $5,000 bail apiece and have been ordered to stay at 
home during their regular duty hours, said Lt. John Dunkin, a spokesman for the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD is conducting an administrative investigation and may "in the next 
few days" relieve them of duty without pay, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Herrera nor his lawyer could be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Levin, who represents Teyechea, said his client has been "grossly 
overcharged" in an attempt by prosecutors to get him to plead guilty to lesser 
offenses. "That is not going to happen," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred Feb. 9 near an on-ramp at the intersections of the 
Harbor and Redondo Beach freeways. The two LAPD officers had left their jobs 
and gone on a drinking spree, authorities say. Friends have said Herrera and 
Teyechea were shooting at street signs.

COUNTY / IN BRIEF; LOS ANGELES; SNOW LEVEL SPURS 9% WATER RATE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's primary source of water, the snowpack in the High Sierra, is not 
high enough to meet the demand of Los Angeles residents, meaning rates will 
increase 9% next month to pay for additional water, officials at the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The snowpack is about two-thirds of normal levels, triggering an automatic 
rate increase, officials said. The new rate takes effect April 1 and will add 
about $3.60 to the average family's bimonthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional revenue will be used to purchase water from the Metropolitan 
Water District. The new rate may be lowered by summer if snow levels increase, 
officials said.

 Baseball owners took a first step toward additional expansion by establishing 
a committee said adding teams probably was years away. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting at Scottsdale, Ariz., John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox was 
picked to head the panel, which won't make its initial report until this 
summer. Most owners say they won't consider expansion until a new labor 
agreement is reached with the players, making it unlikely new teams would start 
play until 1998, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor negotiator Richard Ravitch reported that negotiations with the union 
will resume Monday night in Tampa, Fla., after a 13 1/2-month recess.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; WINOKUR'S WORLD, AND 
WELCOME TO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Never mind Carmen Sandiego. Where in the world is Gene Winokur? 
</P>
<P>
 The 73-year-old has traversed Asia and touched the tip of Chile. He's "done 
the Soviet Union" when it still was the Soviet Union and he's felt an ocean 
liner list after being rammed by a Greek freighter. 
</P>
<P>
 His passport is up to date and the frequent flier miles are spinning like a 
slot machine. So, where in the world is Gene Winokur? 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, he's taking a group of third-, fourth- and fifth-graders from 
the fabled Fountain of Youth in Florida, to dairy farms farther north, and back 
home to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tidy classroom at Nestle Avenue Elementary School in Tarzana, the 
students are learning the lay of the land in a class known as Geography with 
Gene. 
</P>
<P>
 Winokur has already taken the children across the rest of the globe -- a 
journey that students in the Los Angeles Unified School District don't usually 
take in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The semi-retired businessman began volunteering at Nestle four years ago, 
prompted by the answer of a child he asked to locate Alaska and Hawaii. "Right 
between California and Mexico," the child responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Winokur was perplexed. Then he looked on a map. Sure enough, there was the 
Alaska and Hawaii inset -- right between California and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'My God, I better get into the school system,' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Thursday is Geography Day for a dozen or so gifted students who spend an 
hour learning about latitude and longitude, the Prime Meridian, the North Pole 
and the South Pole and all that stuff in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students recently spent their last day with Winokur before rotating to 
other volunteers teaching opera, French or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene, how come we have to quit geography class?" pleaded Sofya Peysekhman, 
sitting in the front row.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know too much," Winokur told the 10-year-old. "The students can't know 
more than the teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 On this last day, Winokur condensed North American geography into the hour by 
providing vignettes of explorers and immigrants to the new world.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who ever heard of Lewis and Clark?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Looks of recognition flashed across the room and hands shot into the air. 
"Actors!" one child shouted. "Superman," another whispered.  
</P>
<P>
 Winokur again looked puzzled. The children were thinking of "Lois and Clark" a 
television series about Lois Lane and Clark Kent, not of the famed explorers 
Meriwether Lewis and Lt. William Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Winokur shook his head and continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get so much television, these kids. They don't read books. They don't 
pick up a newspaper," Winokur said after class. "I try to give them what I can, 
what I know." 
</P>
<P>
 What Winokur knows could give the students he teaches a boost when they hit 
higher grades, said Nestle Principal Edward Catlett  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a world traveler. For our gifted kids we thought that would give them an 
edge in junior high," Catlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winokur, who in addition to teaching geography, also tutors students Tuesdays 
and Thursdays. "He's been a blessing," Catlett said. "He's given us something 
we could never, ever repay him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Winokur said the schools couldn't pay him; the reward he wants isn't 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching was Winokur's first love. He started teaching in New Jersey in 1946, 
for a starting salary of $1,400 a year. Ten years later, when he was nearing 
the top salary of $4,800, he decided to give up teaching, move to California 
and start a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's made his money, Winokur is back to that first love. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm helping a child with a problem and they look up at me and say, 
'Gene, I get it.' That's the biggest paycheck in the world for me," he said. "I 
go home tired, but I'm glad to see some of it has sunk in."

TUGNUTT FILLS BILL FOR CANADIENS; HOCKEY: MONTREAL SOUGHT CAPABLE BACKUP 
GOALIE. HE IS IN 5-2 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the game was won, Ron Tugnutt raised his arms high and beamed behind his 
mask exactly as he did way back in October the first time the Mighty Ducks won 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, the teammates who hugged him and clapped him on the helmet at 
Anaheim Arena wore bleu, blanc et rouge.  
</P>
<P>
 If Tugnutt, traded to the Montreal Canadiens a week and a half ago, held a 
private hope that he could for one night make the Ducks look like they traded 
the wrong goalie, he left satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped 24 of 26 shots by his teammates of 10 days ago in a 5-2 Montreal 
victory in front of a sellout crowd of 17,174. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helped that he had the Stanley Cup champions in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt and Guy Hebert were friendly partners when they were Coach Ron 
Wilson's "No. 1 and 1-A" tandem. Wednesday found them at opposite ends of the 
ice.  
</P>
<P>
 The day of the trade, Tugnutt was disappointed. He has gotten over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things were working out very well here and I didn't see the need for 
a change," Tugnutt said. "Since then, I've settled down and know I have a 
chance to win a Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' recent habit of skipping the introduction of opponents' starting 
lineups to allow more time for their pregame entertainment rituals is 
disrespectful. But by neglecting to announce the Canadien starters, they took 
away the fans' chance to welcome back Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert was shaky at the start, allowing five goals, four of them on long-range 
shots. It was the third time in his four starts since Tugnutt was traded that 
he has given up at least four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guy was not very sharp tonight," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt saw that, too, and his reaction was concern, not gloating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Guy Hebert is a great goaltender. He's proved a lot this year with 
what he's done," Tugnutt said. "It was a hard battle for No. 1 and I think it 
really helped us both. I hope he doesn't lose his edge now. Someone can always 
come up behind you." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal got to Hebert early, when Vincent Damphousse's power-play slapshot 
from near the blue line beat Hebert on the glove side at 5:23 of the first 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt's old teammates didn't let him think shutout long, though, with Peter 
Douris picking up his own rebound to tie the score, 1-1, at 11:21 of the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal scored two more power-play goals, by Brian Bellows and Mathieu 
Schnieder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens led, 3-1, after two periods and, 5-1, midway through the third, 
as Ed Ronan and John LeClair also scored. Patrik Carnback scored the Ducks' 
other goal late in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was an emotion-charged game for center Stephan Lebeau, who was sent to 
the Ducks in the trade. He wanted to beat his old teammates, too, and he came 
whisker-close to scoring a goal in the third period.  
</P>
<P>
 The old relationships made for some jokes -- and some intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was probably a bit of an inside joke, Duck defenseman Sean Hill tried 
a length-of-the-ice shot at Tugnutt just before he went off for a change. Hill 
and the Ducks know "the book" some opponents have on Tugnutt is to catch him 
off balance with long shots -- though it's usually from the red line -- not 
from the far end. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions were higher when a crush of Canadiens cornered Terry Yake after he 
tried to score from close range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys were poking the puck after I covered it up, four or five times," Tugnutt 
said. "My teammates here don't like that. My teammates kept sticking up for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Six fans let it be known they are ready to see Canadian Olympic star Paul 
Kariya in a Duck uniform, standing and waving while wearing white T-shirts that 
spelled out K-A-R-I-Y-A one letter at a time. The last "A" was on the chest of 
a toddler in a man's arms. Kariya probably won't decide whether to join the 
Ducks now or finish the season at the University of Maine until next week, 
according his family's legal adviser, Don Baizley. The Ducks aren't optimistic 
they'll reach a contract agreement this season: "Our offense could change 
dramatically if Paul was to come, but I'm not holding my breath for him," Coach 
Ron Wilson said.

MCSORLEY STEALS GRETZKY'S GLORY; HOCKEY: LATE GOAL IN 4-1 WIN MOVES DEFENSEMAN 
WITHIN 718 OF HOWE'S RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The empty net, ready and waiting, beckoned to Wayne Gretzky with less than 30 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 One more empty-netter and he could have arrived at the hallowed Boston Garden 
tonight within two goals of Gordie Howe's all-time record of 801. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, teammate Marty McSorley whirled and made an improbable 150-footer 
with 24.7 seconds remaining to seal the Kings' 4-1 victory over the Hartford 
Whalers here Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Gretzky is a hat trick away from matching the legendary Howe. He scored 
once and added an assist in front of a crowd of 10,607 at the Civic Center to 
reach No. 798, pulling to within three of Howe. This was where Howe scored his 
final goal -- on April 6, 1980 -- to punctuate his 26-year NHL career. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's goal against the Whalers -- his 33rd of the season -- came at 11:54 
of the first period when he finished off a two-on-none with a shot from below 
the base of the right circle, taking the pass from Dixon Ward. Gretzky beat 
goaltender Sean Burke on the glove side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to think about it (the record) because I'm constantly asked 
about it," said Gretzky, who had four shots on goal. "I had some good chances. 
But we'll have to wait for another game." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the mood was lighthearted afterward, especially since it was the 
Kings' first victory in almost three weeks. They had been mired in nine-game 
winless streak (0-6-3), with their most recent victory coming on Feb. 11 
against the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The win brought the Kings (22-33-9) within three points of the idle San Jose 
Sharks for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we had to do was get through this mentally and play with a lead," 
King goaltender Kelly Hrudey said. "Obviously, it's important we win every game 
and sometimes it's the way you win. We had been giving up leads. Tonight, we 
were never on our heels." 
</P>
<P>
 It all added up for the Kings on Wednesday. There was Hrudey's 30-save 
performance, the penalty-killing unit allowed the Whalers only one goal in 
eight opportunities, Gretzky had two points . . . and there was the 
empty-netter. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley was appropriately sheepish. Gretzky joked that he would have to have 
arms like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's to cut off McSorley's shot. And the Kings took 
turns teasing McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was great," assistant coach Cap Raeder said to McSorley. "I could see 
you looking at Gretz. But it would have been a two-line (pass)." 
</P>
<P>
 King Coach Barry Melrose had his own theory. Maybe it had something to do with 
McSorley's goals, now totaling 83. He has five this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked for Gretz," Melrose said, laughing. "Hey, Marty probably thought, 
'If I'm going to catch Gretz and Gordie, I better get this myself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The often unpredictable McSorley kept his teammates loose again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the bench and the guys were shaking their heads and laughing," 
McSorley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie (Huddy) and Jari (Kurri) have played with him all these years, and 
I'm the one going for the empty net." 
</P>
<P>
 So, did Gretzky say anything? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he's too team oriented," McSorley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, McSorley realized he had more room to move up after the Whalers 
backed up a bit. "I should have fought to work it to the blue line and shot it 
into the far corner," he said. "Because there's no bounce off the near corner. 
And he (Gretzky) could chase it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I let it go, I thought, 'Oh boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the entourage following Wayne Gretzky during his record quest 
does not include Gordie Howe. Months ago, Howe indicated he would not be around 
but said he would show up for any ceremony honoring Gretzky in Los Angeles 
afterward. Wednesday, Howe was playing in an event in Saskatoon, saying he was 
going to be busy this week. "I have to work for a living," Howe told the 
Hartford Courant. "We've donated 180 days of the year for charity with that 
65-city tour. We have to hustle our buns because we're no longer employed by a 
club. There's a tremendous amount of things that have got to be done. I would 
say I would go, but basically time does not permit me to. . . . (Maurice) 
Richard, he never followed me around. When I broke his record for points, 
everybody was totally unaware of the fact and then somebody came up and told 
me."

RAM NOTEBOOK; ANAHEIM IS ATOP JONES' SELECT LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas defensive tackle Jimmie Jones visited Rams Park on Wednesday and 
designated the Rams "at the top of my list" of teams he's considering signing 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 teams have inquired about Jones, an unrestricted free agent who 
has visited Detroit and has been in close contact with Miami and the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, said the team hasn't made a contract 
offer to Jones, but he will be in contact with Jones' agent, Drew Rosenhaus of 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenhaus said five teams have made contract offers to Jones, but the agent 
refused to disclose which teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmie is a hot commodity right now," Rosenhaus said, "and I caution teams 
not to get too excited about him because he's considering a lot of places." 
</P>
<P>
 But it appears that the only roadblock between Jones signing with the Rams is 
his final visit today in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 6 feet 4 and 284 pounds, will meet with Dave Wannstedt, the Bears' 
coach and former Dallas defensive coordinator. Rosenhaus said Jones should be 
signed within the next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams have been my best visit so far," Jones said. "I'm familiar with the 
defensive system they run here because it's similar to what we run in Dallas. 
The only thing I would have to learn is the terminology." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the chances are "slim and none" that he would re-sign with the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money that (will be) offered to me," he said, "(Dallas owner) Jerry Jones 
won't be able to match." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 28, is considered one of Dallas' most talented linemen, but he has been 
a backup in his four seasons with the Cowboys. The Rams are looking for a 
defensive tackle to take some of the pressure inside off Sean Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Free-agent quarterback Chris Miller of Atlanta cleared a physical examination 
by Ram doctors Wednesday and will work out for Rams coaches today.  
</P>
<P>
 The condition of Miller's left knee has been a concern for the Rams, who are 
looking for a quarterback to replace Jim Everett, who's on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 28, threw 15 touchdown passes with only six interceptions through 
eight games in 1992. But he has played only three games since undergoing 
reconstructive knee surgery in November 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller visited Detroit Monday and also is considering New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' search for an offensive tackle continues today when the Giants' Doug 
Riesenberg, 6-5 and 275 pounds, visits Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are prepared to extend an offer sheet to Houston tackle Kevin 
Donnalley (6-5, 305 pounds), a restricted free agent, but are hesitant because 
it could disrupt trade talks for Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver also has contacted the Rams to see if they're interested in Bronco 
tackle Don Maggs. The Rams had shown interest in Maggs, 6-5 and 290 pounds, 
when he left Houston for Denver last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Sevier, who coached in three Super Bowls with the Redskins, was hired as 
the Rams' special teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevier, 52, considered one of the NFL's top special teams coaches, replaces 
Howard Tippett, who resigned last week.

DUCKS NO MATCH FOR MONTREAL; HOCKEY: RON TUGNUTT MAKES 24 SAVES AGAINST HIS

 Ron Tugnutt and Guy Hebert were friendly partners when they were Coach Ron 
Wilson's "No. 1 and 1-A" goaltending tandem for the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday found them at opposite ends of the ice, each guarding a net of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tugnutt, traded to the Montreal Canadiens 1 1/2 weeks ago, held a private 
hope that he could for one night make the Ducks look like they traded the wrong 
goaltender, he left satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped 24 of 26 shots by his former teammates in a 5-2 Montreal victory 
before 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt said he wouldn't get too emotional about the game, but when it was 
over he pumped his arms much as he did in the Ducks' first-ever victory against 
Edmonton in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't overly pumped up for the game, but I was ready," Tugnutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the trade, Tugnutt was disappointed. But he has gotten over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things were working out very well here, and I didn't see the need for 
a change," he said. "Since then, I've settled down and know I have a chance to 
win a Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert was shaky, giving up five goals, four of them on long-range shots. It 
was the third time in his four starts since Tugnutt was traded that he has 
given up at least four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Guy Hebert is a great goaltender," Tugnutt said. He's proved a lot 
this year with what he's done. It was a hard battle for No. 1, and I think it 
really helped us both. I hope he doesn't lose his edge now. Someone can always 
come up behind you. You have to stay sharp to be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' recent ploy of skipping the introduction of opponents' starting 
lineups to allow more time for their pregame entertainment is one thing. But by 
neglecting to announce the Canadien starters with Tugnutt in the net 10 days 
after the popular goalie was traded, they took away the fans' chance to welcome 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a cheer just before the anthem, right after they put our lineup on 
the scoreboard," Tugnutt said. "I sort of thought it was for me, and if it was, 
I thank the fans for doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also an emotion-charged game for the other half of the trade, center 
Stephan Lebeau. He wanted to beat his old teammates too, and he came 
whisker-close to scoring a goal in the third period when he tried to angle a 
shot past Tugnutt. The puck hit the inside edge of the left post before Tugnutt 
covered the loose puck. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal got to Hebert early, when Vincent Damphousse's power-play slap shot 
from near the blue line beat Hebert on the glove side at 5:23 of the first 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt's old teammates didn't let him have a shutout for long, though, with 
Peter Douris getting his own rebound to tie the score 1-1 at 11:21. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal scored two more power-play goals -- by Brian Bellows and Mathieu 
Schnieder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens led, 3-1, after two periods and 5-1 midway through the third, as 
Ed Ronan and John LeClair also scored. Patrik Carnback scored the Ducks' other 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was probably a bit of an inside joke, Duck defenseman Sean Hill tried 
a length-of-the-ice shot at Tugnutt just before he went off for a change. Hill 
and the Ducks know "the book" some opponents have on Tugnutt is to catch him 
off balance with long shots -- though it's usually from the red line -- not 
from the far end. In any case the shot did hit Tugnutt, but bounced harmlessly 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Six fans let it be known they are ready to see Canadian Olympic star Paul 
Kariya in a Duck uniform, standing and waving while wearing white T-shirts that 
spelled out K-A-R-I-Y-A one letter at a time. The last "A" was on the chest of 
a toddler in a man's arms. Kariya probably won't decide whether to join the 
Ducks or finish the season at the University of Maine until next week, 
according his family legal adviser, Don Baizley. The Ducks are believed to have 
offered Kariya, their top pick and the fourth overall last June, a contract 
worth slightly less than the four-year $3.45-million deal No. 3 pick Chris 
Gratton of Tampa Bay signed. However, the sides apparently are far apart. 
Kariya, 19, has the option of trying to help the troubled Black Bears repeat as 
NCAA champions, although their status is uncertain because of an academically 
ineligible player. Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira has not been optimistic 
Kariya will sign now. "I think he wants to come," Ferreira said after speaking 
with Kariya Wednesday, but added the decision might come down to contract 
terms. If Kariya returns to school, the Ducks will still retain his rights for 
two years.

 Peter Andersson, playing in only his fifth game all season, scored his first 
goal since April 2 to break a 2-2 tie and had his first assist of the season to 
lead the Rangers in a 5-2 victory over the Quebec Nordiques in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He is usually relegated to a role with the Rangers' Black Aces, five men who 
rarely play and usually watch from the upper boxes at Madison Square Garden.

 "When I put the puck in, the first thing I did was to look up and point to the

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmi Bredahl was asked to assess his chances against Oscar De La Hoya. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy-30, in my favor," he said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Why only 70-30?" brother Johnny Bredahl said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I might fall off my chair," Bredahl said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The oddsmakers are taking a slightly different view of the main event that 
will reopen the Olympic Auditorium, now billed as the Grand Olympic, Saturday 
night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl will be a prohibitive underdog when he tries to make a second 
successful defense of something known as the World Boxing Organization 
junior-lightweight title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the parlance of the fight game, he is an opponent . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is supposed to be a showcase for the enormous skills of De La Hoya, who 
is the subject of the "Oscar's Night" mural on the side of the building. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 All four participants in the 12-round bouts Saturday are unbeaten, but the 
consensus is that International Boxing Federation super-middleweight champion 
James Toney's bout against Tim Littles of the Lou Duva stable will be the more 
competitive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl is a mystery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He will be fighting for the first time in the United States and has been 
training behind closed doors except for Sunday, when he shadowboxed a few 
rounds during a public workout at the Grand Olympic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This much is known about him: He is 26, 16-0 with five knockouts, a native of 
Copenhagen and a southpaw. At 5 feet 10, he will be a rare foe who won't have 
to look up to De La Hoya. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He has a crewcut and a boxer's nose that is evidence of a long amateur career 
in a country where you can't turn professional until you are 21.He speaks 
fluent English, having studied the language from the fifth through 10th grades. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl won his WBO title -- not to be confused with the more prestigious WBC, 
WBA, IBF or WWF titles -- on Sept., 4, 1992, when he decisioned Daniel Londas 
of France. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that night before 10,000 fans in a Copenhagen soccer stadium, Johnny 
Bredahl, 25, outpointed Jose Quirino of Mexico to win the WBO super-flyweight 
title. That was the first time that two brothers had won world titles, no 
matter what letters, on the same card. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 His record indicates that he is not a big puncher, but Bredahl is reputed to 
be a tough guy and a good technician. After a two-month training grind in 
Tyler, Tex., supervised by trainer Al McCoy, he should be in peak condition. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl's book on De La Hoya: "He has two arms, two legs and a pretty face. It 
won't be so pretty after the fight, though." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who does not lack confidence, Bredahl is a charmer whose boasts 
usually are made with a smile. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He is so popular at home that the bout will be shown there live at 6 a.m. 
Sunday. The telecast also will be beamed to Sweden and Norway, where pro boxing 
is banned. The commentator will be Ingemar Johansson, whose toonderbolts won 
him the heavyweight title from Floyd Patterson in 1959. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When Bredahl arrived in Los Angeles last week, he was told that there was a 
revolving restaurant atop the hotel where he would be staying. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Great," he said. "I'll have my victory party there.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the USC-UCLA basketball game tonight at the Sports Arena could be how 
well Trojan freshman guard Stais Boseman, who did an excellent job on Jason 
Kidd Saturday, is able to defend against the Bruins. He will guard Tyus Edney, 
Shon Tarver or Charles O'Bannon, depending upon the situation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'll believe Clipper owner Donald Sterling is going to build an arena in L.A. 
when I see it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita Handicap contender Kissin Kris is a quirky horse who wears 
earmuffs when he runs, but that won't present a problem Saturday for his new 
trainer, Jack Van Berg. The Hall of Fame member trained Gate Dancer, who used 
to wear something resembling a ski mask. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Front-runner The Wicked North is the probable favorite, but only three winners 
in the last 40 years have led the Big 'Cap wire to wire. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Hackett, David Leisure, Tom Dreesen, Kevin Dobson, Mike Connors and 
Efrem Zimbalist are among those who will play in the ninth annual Juvenile 
Diabetes Foundation/Nutrasweet golf tournament Monday at the North Ranch 
Country Club in Westlake Village. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My candidate to replace PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman is Bill Murray.

LAKERS GET HOT IN NICK OF TIME, DEFEAT BULLS; PRO BASKETBALL: VAN EXEL'S 22 
POINTS, INCLUDING FIVE THREE-POINTERS, AND VLADE DIVAC'S 27 POINTS LEAD TO 
97-89 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Laker players thought Tuesday's practice was pay back, their chance to haze 
Nick Van Exel with reminders of how B.J. Armstrong had gone for 28 points when 
the Chicago Bulls came to the Forum in November, the return for Van Exel's 
quickness to ride them after bad showings. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel had another idea. He decided to make Wednesday night at Chicago 
Stadium the real pay back: 22 points, 17 in the second half, and five 
three-pointers to tie a team record for the third time this season as the 
Lakers beat the Bulls, 97-89, before 18,146. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong? He had 10 points, on three-of-nine shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Van Exel's streaky rookie season all wrapped into one game. He came in 
shooting 31.7% the previous 12 outings, then opened two of 11 against the 
struggling Bulls, a struggle that lasted nearly to the end of the third 
quarter. Then, with 1:53 left, he sank a three-pointer. Two possessions later, 
he made another, then followed that with a third. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with another standout game from Vlade Divac -- 27 points and 11 
rebounds -- that was the spark as the Lakers built a 14-point lead with 8:07 
left. When the Bulls used a 15-4 run to cut the deficit to 87-84 with 3:12 to 
go, the pair stepped up again. Divac made two freethrows, Van Exel made a 
three-pointer, then a short runner down the lane, then made four straight from 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he gets a streak like that going," Coach Randy Pfund said, "you let him 
run the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Van Exel, who finished by making five of his last seven shots: "He really 
doesn't allow me to do it, I just do it. It's not like I need a green light or 
anything. Right now I say I'm undisciplined. Put it like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Or put it like this: The Lakers had a 97-89 advantage after the second Van 
Exel power surge of the half and were only 31 seconds away from their third 
victory in five games and a third consecutive win at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first three did not feel good," Van Exel said. "B.J. or John (Paxson) 
kind of hit my arm as they went by. I said, 'Let me throw up another one and 
see what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone saw, just as everyone knew this run by the Lakers and their cocky, 
erratic rookie couldn't have come at a worse time for the home team and their 
faithful, already at odds. Tensions were high from the day before, when fans 
awoke to read that Scottie Pippen, upset at being booed in a Monday loss to 
Cleveland, turned it into a racial issue and said he had never heard a white 
Bull player get booed at Chicago Stadium, apparently forgetting he has a 
teammate named Will Perdue. 
</P>
<P>
 He issued an apology for that comment and for ripping General Manager Jerry 
Krause for not making a trade before last week's deadline, saying they came in 
the frustration of the defeat. This time, Pippen apparently forgot that the 
digs at Krause came before the Cavalier game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen got a mixed greeting Wednesday, with a fair amount of boos. He was, at 
least, pleased about moving back from shooting guard to small forward as Pete 
Myers returned to the opening lineup. If it made him feel any better, plenty of 
Bulls regardless of color were booed en route to losing for the fifth time in 
seven home games since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing through the boos," said Pippen, who finished with 24 points and 
13 rebounds. "When you're losing, you really have to play through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls also had to play through injuries. Toni Kukoc started at power 
forward in place of Horace Grant, slowed by back spasms, though Grant did enter 
in the second half to contribute 11 rebounds in 22 minutes. Also, Luc Longley 
opened at center for Scott Williams, who had a sore throat.

CLIPPERS' WILKINS TAKES STING OUT OF HORNETS; PRO BASKETBALL: HIS 33 POINTS AND 
A HOT FOURTH QUARTER HELP L.A. BEAT CHARLOTTE, 118-109. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Clippers have been more exciting since acquiring Dominique Wilkins from 
the Atlanta Hawks for Danny Manning, but they had not been any more successful, 
losing their first two games with Wilkins after squandering fourth-quarter 
leads. 
</P>
<P>
 But that changed in Wednesday night's game against the Charlotte Hornets at 
the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who averaged 31.5 points in his first two games as a Clipper, scored 
33 points, 12 in the fourth quarter, as the Clippers beat the Hornets, 118-109, 
before an announced crowd of 10,262. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who had struggled in the final quarter of his first two games as a 
Clipper, scoring a total of nine points in that quarter against Seattle and 
Golden State, made five of six shots in the final quarter as the Clippers built 
a 19-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who made 14 of 26 shots, including seven dunks, sank his first four 
shots as the Clippers opened the fourth quarter with a 20-6 spurt. He made 
three jumpers and a layup. After making his third straight shot, a fadeaway 
jumper, Wilkins raised both fingers in the air as he glided back to play 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first half, I was feeling a little sluggish and my shot wasn't going," 
said Wilkins, who had 17 points in the first half. "In the fourth quarter, I 
exerted myself a little bit more to get a spurt to break the game open. It 
worked and then everybody else clicked." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss, who coached Wilkins for the last three seasons in 
Atlanta, said Wilkins, 34, has improved with age. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that 21 is his age, not his number," Weiss quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilkins: "People ask me, 'How can you still do the stuff you do at 34?' 
And I my response is, 'What is 34 supposed to feel like?' I feel I can play as 
long as I want to play, as long as I take care of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss maintains that Wilkins has brought a new attitude to the Clippers 
(19-36). 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing he's given us is just an enthusiastic lift," Weiss said. 
"It's just night and day (since Wilkins joined the team). Everybody's playing 
well and hard and having fun. All the uncertainty is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are showing a different attitude than I've seen in a Clipper team," 
he said. "They believe that they can come out and win. The energy and 
confidence is there. We've just got to keep believing and playing hard. It's 
come around quicker than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper rookie forward Harold Ellis, who idolized Wilkins while growing up in 
Atlanta, also showed that he can dunk with Wilkins. Ellis made 10 shots in a 
row in the second half, finishing with 10 baskets in 12 attempts, and scored 23 
points. He had four of the Clippers' 17 dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nique was brought in to bring excitement to the Clippers," Ellis said. "And I 
try to imitate everything he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson, benched in the fourth quarter of Tuesday's 114-109 loss to 
the Golden State Warriors, ignited the Clippers in the first half against 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who had averaged 12.7 points, 8.8 assists and 1.4 steals over the 
previous nine games, helped the Clippers get off to a fine start, getting 10 
points, seven assists and two steals in the first half as the Clippers took a 
66-54 lead by halftime. He finished with 15 points, eight assists and four 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Ron Harper, who had 13 points, left the game because of a strained left 
hamstring with 3:21 remaining. . . . Danny Manning, traded to the Atlanta Hawks 
for Dominique Wilkins last Thursday, was diplomatic when asked about Clipper 
owner Donald T. Sterling during a conference call with the media on Wednesday. 
"Mr. Sterling is a very eccentric man." Manning said. "He really wants to win. 
Things just haven't fallen into place for him." . . . Clipper forward Tom 
Tolbert, who had a minor back injury, didn't dress for the game.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; HARRICK'S CRITICS SHOULD EASE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last spring, maybe a day or two before the Artesia High School basketball 
banquet, we called UCLA Coach Jim Harrick. Harrick was going to the banquet, 
not because he cared about Artesia, but because forward Charles O'Bannon and 
center Avondre Jones, two of the most sought-after recruits in the country, had 
yet to make public their choice of colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick wouldn't be alone. Kentucky's Rick Pitino, who like Harrick 
desperately wanted to sign O'Bannon, also would be there. In fact, Pitino had 
agreed to be the guest speaker. Pitino didn't do it out of the kindness of his 
heart; he did it because he needed a forward to take Jamal Mashburn's spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan Coach Steve Fisher would be there too. With Chris Webber leaving for 
the NBA, Fisher had to have a center. The same went for USC, which would send 
assistant coach Charlie Parker as its emissary. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, four grown men--with combined earnings of easily more than a million 
dollars a year--would be stuck at a high school banquet trying to look as if 
they cared who won the junior varsity hustle award. 
</P>
<P>
 "What exactly do you do at one of these things?" we asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll sit in the back and make faces at Pitino," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weird job you got there," we said. "Sportswriting is weird, but what you do. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, buddy," Harrick said matter of factly, "be careful what you wish for." 
</P>
<P>
 For Harrick, words to live by. HARRICK--PART II 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick wished for the UCLA job, got it and now has the scar tissue to prove 
it. Despite five consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances (and a sixth one on 
the way), a 19-4 record this season, a No. 15 ranking, a boffo recruiting class 
last year, another one this year and a 135-50 career record at UCLA, Harrick 
still flinches when someone yells his name. 
</P>
<P>
 If disappointing USC somehow pulls off its second consecutive upset and beats 
the good-but-not-great Bruins tonight at the Sports Arena, it only will get 
worse for Harrick. The anti-Jims will howl across the talk show airwaves, and 
all because the Bruins will have lost five of 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
 If Trojan Coach George Raveling went 19-5, USC would name an arena after 
him--that is, if USC had its own arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile at UCLA, where spoiled fans and boosters are trapped in some sort of 
1960s and '70s time warp, the Harrick-stinks mentality is only a loss away. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange how this works. Indiana lost by 50 to Minnesota earlier this week and 
nobody was calling for Coach Bob Knight's head. OK, a few Hoosier fans were, 
but those are the same yahoos who list Mother Teresa, John F. Kennedy and Kent 
Benson as the three most influential people in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina, the defending NCAA champion, has the most pure talent of any 
team in the country, though you wouldn't know it by its six defeats and another 
handful of near-misses. Yet, Coach Dean Smith still walks with a halo above his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 At Temple, John Chaney suffers a postgame meltdown and nobody seems too upset, 
including the school's administration, which suspends him for only one game. In 
fact, when he returns, students wave "We Love Chaney" posters. 
</P>
<P>
 And at USC, Raveling's failure to make good on his preseason hype and lead the 
Trojans to an NCAA bid earns little more than an "Oh, well, maybe next year." 
As it stands now, the Trojans are reduced to sweating out an NIT bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if Harrick missed the NCAA, he'd be meeting with his Century 21 
agent to discuss listing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple truth is this: 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick isn't the best coach in the country. Then again, UCLA wasn't the best 
program when he inherited it five seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't the best recruiter, but he was smart enough to hire one of the best, 
assistant coach Lorenzo Romar. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't the best X's and O's man in the business, nor is he the most popular. 
Nobody asked him to be in "Blue Chips," or chat with Lesley Visser at halftime. 
Even his own athletic director treats him with mild indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Harrick is a solid basketball guy who got his wish. Or in recent 
weeks, his nightmare. He hasn't done anything to make us forget John Wooden, 
but he has eased the memory of Larry and Walt what's-their-names. Consider it a 
wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if you want better, talk to Peter Dalis, the guy in charge of the 
hiring. In the meantime, Harrick is doing the best he can, which, all things 
considered, deserves something new to these parts: The benefit of the doubt. 
HELP WANTED 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of Tennessee Coach Wade Houston doesn't come as a surprise, 
but the people's choice of a replacement might. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a vote by viewers of a Knoxville television station, 53% want 
Tennessee Athletic Director Doug Dickey to hire a well-known local coach who 
has won three national championships and 525 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Two problems: the coach is Lady Volunteer legend Pat Summitt, and she doesn't 
want the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not interested in coaching men's basketball," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad. Summitt, whose team is ranked No. 1 in the country, might have been 
able to make the transition. She certainly couldn't have done much worse than 
Houston, a decent man who is in the middle of leading Tennessee to its worst 
season in more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Summitt had her chance five years ago, before Houston was hired. 
Intrigued by the idea of coaching the men, Summitt discussed the possibilities 
with her husband, but later decided not to pursue the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I was really serious about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Summitt said she is more interested in "closing the gap" between the 
popularity of the men's game and the women's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see women's basketball grow," Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 One day it will happen: A woman is going to take the plunge and that will be 
that. It just won't be Summitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when that happens, it will be important to put together the right 
staff," Summitt said. "Recruiting, to me, would be the biggest hurdle, the 
biggest challenge. You're talking about convincing young men that she knows the 
game and that she can prepare you for the NBA. It would take a real strong 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
 There is hope. Pitino's coaching staff at Kentucky includes Bernadette 
Locke-Mattox, a fourth-year assistant who is learning the game from one of the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud for Bernadette," Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the search for Houston's replacement commences immediately. The 
most recent Tennessee wish list includes Charlie Spoonhour of St. Louis, Kevin 
O'Neill of Marquette, Ralph Willard of Western Kentucky, John Calipari of 
Massachusetts and Pete Gillen of Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
 One rumor to forget: Roy Williams of Kansas. He's not going anywhere, 
especially to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 However, here are two other names that eventually might come up: Arizona's 
Lute Olson and Texas' Tom Penders. And don't be surprised if Iowa State's 
Johnny Orr and/or Michigan State's Jud Heathcote call it quits at season's end. 
THE BIG EIGHT GROWS UP 
</P>
<P>
 The merger between the Big Eight and the four Southwest Conference 
defectors--Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech and Baylor--isn't perfect, but it will 
do for now. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials have acquired the trademark for the name Big 12. If that's 
the case, the Big 10 Conference, which actually has 11 members and eventually 
wants to expand, might have a problem, unless they go to 14 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, here's the early reaction among assorted Big Eight coaches: 
</P>
<P>
 From Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton, who spent a decade in the SWC with former 
member Arkansas--"I think it's a tremendous day for the Big Eight. I think this 
league will be the best conference in America. Just go down the line on every 
sport." As for the so-so basketball reputation of the four newcomers, Sutton 
said, "Some people think that their basketball programs aren't quite up to the 
level of the Big Eight. But if they're not . . . I can't help but believe that 
they'll be on an even keel with us." 
</P>
<P>
 From Oklahoma's Billy Tubbs--"I personally think it's a really good move. 
Personally, I think it will help (with recruiting in Texas). It doubles our 
conference population. More players are in the conference area and more players 
will want to play in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Kansas' Williams: "From a basketball perspective, I'm not sure 
it's going to help. But from an athletic department perspective it might help. 
It's going to make it harder for me to recruit Texas." THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who rescued the Jayhawk program from NCAA probation five years ago 
and has since won three Big Eight Conference championships and made two Final 
Four appearances, is still steamed about a recent letter he received from a 
Kansas faculty member. The letter criticized Williams' 11th-ranked Jayhawks 
(22-6) and deemed a recent and rare three-game losing streak as "totally 
unacceptable." Williams, easily one of the top five college coaches in the 
game, couldn't believe his eyes. "I was really disappointed that a faculty 
(member) would write me a letter," he said. "If the faculty requires that we 
win a game, then there is no place for Roy Williams in college athletics." 
Knowing Williams, it isn't a threat, but a promise. . . . Temple's Chaney, the 
subject of an exhaustive Sports Illustrated profile, hasn't seen a word of the 
story. "I'm afraid to read any articles," he said. "I don't read papers or 
listen to the radio during the season at all." Chaney also offered advice to 
any coach looking to copy his habit of loading up on tough nonconference 
opponents. "I wouldn't recommend this to young guys," he said, adding: "If I 
were at another job, I might go another direction." . . . Pitino, the former 
New York Knick coach, on the new NCAA rule that allows players to test the pro 
market before deciding to stay or leave school: "I think it's going to be 
pandemonium in certain cases. In all likelihood, you're going to see a lot of 
people putting their names in to see what happens. I'm hearing everything from 
sophomores, even freshmen putting their names in." The Top 10

 It was a great victory, Stu Jackson's biggest as a college coach, but he's 
looking for more of a trend. Make it a lesson, he said. Use it to get into the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Finley scored 20 points and held Jalen Rose to 15 as Wisconsin snapped 
a four-game losing streak with a 71-58 upset of third-ranked Michigan in a Big 
Ten game at Madison on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great win, but it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot unless we take 
from this game an understanding of just exactly why we won," Jackson said. "We 
need to carry those things through our final three games" against Indiana, 
Northwestern and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers (16-8, 7-8), losers of eight of 12 after an 11-0 start, snapped 
Michigan's nine-game winning streak and kept their own playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan (20-5, 12-3) shot only 36%, Wisconsin 54%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wisconsin is a team that deserves to be in the NCAA Tournament," Michigan 
Coach Steve Fisher said. "This win will catapult Wisconsin into getting some 
more wins on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Arkansas 108, Louisiana State 105 -- Al Dillard's three-pointer sent the 
game into overtime and Scotty Thurman's three-pointer won it for the Razorbacks 
at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman had 27 points to give Arkansas (23-2, 13-2) a share of the 
Southeastern Conference regular-season title and the Western Division title 
outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Brandon missed a desperation three-pointer at the buzzer for LSU (11-14, 
5-10), which has lost seven in a row for the first time in Dale Brown's 22 
years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Duke 73, Maryland 69 -- Grant Hill scored 11 of the Blue Devils' final 
21 points, and they won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship at College 
Park, Md., by beating Maryland (15-10, 7-8) for the 15th time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill scored 19 points and Cherokee Parks had 12 for Duke (22-3, 12-3).

 Wake Forest 68, No. 5 North Carolina 61 -- Randolph Childress scored 18 points 
at Winston-Salem, N.C., as the Demon Deacons (19-9, 9-6) won for the third time 
this season against a top-five team. 
</P>

 The loss knocked the Tar Heels (23-6, 10-5) out of the ACC race, giving Duke 
the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Missouri 68, Kansas State 57 -- The Tigers (23-2, 13-0), bidding to 
become the first Big Eight team in 23 years to go undefeated in conference 
play, passed their final road test by beating Kansas State (17-10, 4-9). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Kentucky 80, No. 19 Florida 77 -- The Wildcats (23-5, 12-3) fell behind 
by 19 points in the first half of an SEC game at Lexington, Ky., but after 
winning from 31 behind on the road at LSU, catching Florida (22-6, 11-4) was no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Louisville 82, Southern Mississippi 75 -- Greg Minor scored five of his 
22 points in a second-half run as the Cardinals (24-4, 10-2) won at Southern 
Mississippi (13-12, 5-6) in the Metro Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Massachusetts 92, Duquesne 78 -- Lou Roe had 27 points and 15 rebounds 
to lead the Minutemen (24-6, 14-2) in an Atlantic 10 victory over the Dukes 
(15-11, 8-8) at Amherst, Mass., that was in doubt until Donta Bright hit 10 
free throws in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska 89, No. 21 Oklahoma State 81 -- Eric Piatkowski scored 32 points and 
the Cornhuskers (17-8, 7-6) withstood a 27-point night by Bryant Reeves of

AGASSI RUN RAGGED BY SANTORO; TENNIS: HIS COMEBACK BID TAKES DAY OFF IN TWO-SET 
LOSS TO FRENCHMAN. HE SAYS LONG LAYOFF HAS TAKEN TOLL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seven matches into his comeback, Andre Agassi hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling himself physically, mentally and emotionally drained after 
unexpectedly winning a tournament at Scottsdale, Ariz., last week and playing 
here Tuesday night, Agassi was eliminated from the Newsweek Champions Cup on 
Wednesday by Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi wasn't the least bit discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't about tennis," said Agassi, who won at Scottsdale after being 
sidelined for five months because of a wrist injury that required surgery in 
December. "From my wrist to my body, I'm just not fresh right now. It's not 
easy when you go five months without playing and all of a sudden you're playing 
all these matches in a row. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned about this. Had I gone out there and felt ready and felt 
fresh and didn't feel any problems, then I'd say this is just where I am. But I 
don't think today is a clear reflection of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi was in good company Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fourth-seeded Sergi Bruguera, who won the French Open last year, was 
defeated by Aaron Krickstein, 6-7 (7-2), 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fifth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic squandered a 5-2 lead in the third-set 
tiebreaker and was a 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5) loser against Darren Cahill of 
Australia, who is ranked 1,013th, has had seven knee operations and hadn't won 
a match other than by default in nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic hasn't won a match in four appearances here. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, who had won the night before, saw this day coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, it was a matter of time before the odds started getting (to be) 
too much against me," he said. "I felt like I toughed it out as much as I could 
out there, but it just wasn't in me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to take a little time off and give my wrist a chance to feel fresh 
again and give my body and mind a few days (off), then come back at it strong. 
I feel like I've made some big steps forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Scottsdale tournament, Agassi hadn't played since Sept. 24, when he 
defeated Roger Smith of the Bahamas in a Davis Cup match. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi is ranked 31st in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I wouldn't be playing if it wasn't OK," said Agassi, who wore a 
brace on his right wrist. "But nevertheless, there's a certain fatigue factor 
involved with the wrist when it's been off for so long and when it's undergone 
what it's had to go through. Nobody expected me to win Scottsdale, so I've 
played a lot more than I was anticipating." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro, who held serve throughout the match, didn't help by running down and 
returning almost all of Agassi's shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering my circumstance, he's one of the tougher players to play against 
because he moves well, hits well off both sides and is going to make me hit a 
lot of balls," Agassi said. "That's a tough player to play against when you're 
not 100% there." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro reached a career-high No. 24 in the rankings last March before a thumb 
injury cut short his season. Ranked 99th this week, he twice watched Agassi 
play at Scottsdale and said he was amazed by Agassi's concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you stop for a few months and then you come back, for me it was like I 
never played any matches in my life," Santoro said. "It's like you don't know 
how to practice for your match. You're not concentrating, you are looking 
everywhere. You forget your socks. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 For Agassi, it's a matter of not forgetting where he's headed. 
</P>
<P>
 Or how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come back thinking it was all going to happen right away, and it's 
happened a lot quicker than I thought," he said. "But it's going to be a long 
road, there's no question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that before I won Scottsdale, and I knew that after I won Scottsdale. 
And I know that after getting beat. It hasn't changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Stefan Edberg advanced with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over former USC 
All-American Byron Black. . . . Other seeded players advancing included No. 6 
Michael Chang, No. 8 Thomas Muster, No. 10 Petr Korda, No. 11 Marc Rosset, No. 
15 MaliVai Washington and No. 16 Carlos Costa. . . . Patrick McEnroe defeated 
No. 13 Wayne Ferreira, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4. . . . Goran Ivanisevic was fined 
$1,000 by the ATP for failing to attend a postmatch news conference.

MERTEN HANDLES WIND, RAIN; GOLF: SHE HOLDS A ONE-SHOT LEAD AT 71 AFTER ONE 
ROUND OF THE TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<P>
 It was a different golf course from the one 40 tournament champions and LPGA 
Hall of Famers practiced on. 
</P>
<P>
 In rain and 15-20 m.p.h. wind that gusted to 30 m.p.h., Lauri Merten was the 
only player who broke par, shooting a one-under 71 to take the lead after the 
opening round of the first LPGA Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good to see everybody else was having as much fun as I was," said 
Merten, who won the U.S. Women's Open in 1993. "The course played fair, but 
extremely difficult. It was hard to hit the greens in the wind and rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Merten said the first-day scores might have been even higher if the tees on 
eight or nine holes of the Jack Nicklaus-designed North-South course at Grand 
Cypress Resort hadn't been moved up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, I felt like the course was set up a little too hard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy King, Donna Andrews, Patty Sheehan, Dottie Mochrie and Kris Tschetter 
shot par to trail Merten by one shot. Andrews, Mochrie and Tschetter bogeyed 
the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Alfredsson, Laura Davies, Florence Descampe and Dawn Coe-Jones were two 
strokes behind at 73, followed by Barb Mucha, Judy Dickinson, Helen Dobson, Lis 
Awlater and Kelly Robbins at 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Lopez was among nine players at 75, and JoAnne Carner and Pat Bradley 
shot 77. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough out there, a day that demanded a lot of patience," Andrews said. 
"You almost felt like, 'Why did you play a practice round?' The course played 
so differently than the day before." 
</P>
<P>
 The $700,000 event, sponsored by Chrysler-Plymouth, is similar to the PGA 
Tour's Tournament of Champions, now called the Mercedes Championships, and 
features winners from the 1992 and 1993 LPGA seasons, plus winners of the first 
two tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Merten missed seven greens and made the turn at two over par after missing 
six-foot putts to save par on Nos. 7 and 9. She birdied Nos. 10 and 14, then 
made a five-foot putt on No. 18 to lead.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SALMON EXPECTED TO GET $7.2-MILLION DEAL

<P>
 The Angels are expected to sign right fielder Tim Salmon to a four-year 
contract today that will make him the highest-paid second-year player in 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, according to sources close to the negotiations, is expected to receive 
about $7.2 million, topping the record set last month by Dodger catcher Mike 
Piazza, who signed a three-year, $4.2-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, the American League's 1993 rookie of the year, will become the Angels' 
highest-paid position player. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you is that we're close," said Salmon, who met privately with 
Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi on Wednesday at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, 25, batted .283 last season with 31 home runs and 95 runs batted in 
before his season ended prematurely because of a broken ring finger. He was 
only the 19th rookie in baseball history to hit 30 homers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to sign shortstop Gary DiSarcina to a three-year, 
$2.5-million contract. Center fielder Chad Curtis was offered a three-year, 
$4-million contract by the Angels, but the two sides remained more than 
$500,000 apart late Wednesday. If Curtis does not sign, he will be renewed on a 
one-year contract for about $425,000.

 Angel owners Gene and Jackie Autry came to the workout to introduce themselves 
to second baseman Kevin Flora, whose wife was killed last year in a car 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 They spoke for several minutes discussing Flora's well-being, and Gene Autry 
gave Flora a newspaper article that detailed Flora's plight overcoming the 
tragedy.

 Damion Easley, showing the Angels that he will be able to make the adjustment 
to third base, went two for three with two RBIs in an intrasquad game and made 
two plays on slow rollers to third base that caught Manager Buck Rodgers by 
surprise. "I think he's going to be just fine," Rodgers said. "His reflexes at 
third are as good as they ever were." Easley was limited to 73 games last 
season because of recurring shin splints that eventually resulted in surgery. . 
. . Rookie outfielder Garret Anderson hit a homer over the right-field fence 
against Mark Langston in his first spring at-bat. Curtis hit a three-run homer 
against Joe Grahe, and first baseman Nelson Simmons hit a homer against John 
Farrell. . . . Outfielder Bo Jackson struck out against Hilly Hathway and Craig 
Lefferts. . . . Starter Russ Springer gave up two hits, two walks and three 
runs to the six batters he faced before Rodgers pulled him. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Tired of the pressure and frustrated with the judges, British ice dancers 
Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who won the gold medal in the 1984 Winter 
Olympics and the bronze at Lillehammer, retired from competitive skating 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The British couple, who won the gold medal in 1984 at Sarajevo, made the 
announcement after finishing third in their Olympic comeback at Lillehammer. 
The decision means the pair will not try for a fifth world title at this 
month's championships in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a long hard think about it, and we have decided that we will not, 
repeat not, be going (to Japan)," Dean said. "We couldn't skate any better than 
we skated (at the Olympics). It was one of those memorable performances. We 
were disillusioned a little bit about how it happened, but we were elated by 
the reaction. The audience were our judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Torvill: "I think it was a good note for us to end on. That is what we 
will remember about our return to competition skating."

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; FLY'N J. BRYAN WILL TRY TO GO THE EXTRA 
MILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan, the colt who will try to stay undefeated Sunday in the 
$150,000 San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita, is not named after either J. Brian 
McGrath, recently appointed commissioner of the Thoroughbred Racing Assns. 
tracks, or Brian Mayberry, who trained the colt last year. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Fly'n J. Bryan is named after the son of Joseph Fenley, who owns the 
horse. Young Fenley was on hand when his namesake ran six furlongs in a quick 
1:08 2/5 to win his first start by 4 1/2 lengths on Jan. 22, but was missing 
when Fly'n J. Bryan waded into stakes competition on Feb. 13 and won the San 
Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his son's absence that day, Joseph Fenley said: "The truth is, he 
couldn't handle the stress of being the only 5-year-old in the Turf Club." 
</P>
<P>
 The people always feel the stress before the horse does, even if one of them 
is only two years older than the horse. Potentially, Fly'n J. Bryan could be 
the best horse Doug Peterson has had since Seattle Slew, and the trainer 
doesn't want to waste the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this horse can stretch out some," Peterson said this week. "He should 
be able to handle a mile, a mile and a sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond that, I'm not so sure. As we find out, I don't want to beat him up. 
I'd rather have a horse at the end of the year who's ready to run in the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint than a horse who's been ruined by the Kentucky Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan ran three-quarters of a mile while beating maidens, then went 
an extra eighth in the San Vicente. The San Rafael, at a mile around two turns, 
was first run in 1981. It will be the most important California race for 
3-year-olds this year and will have more impact nationally than Saturday's 
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990-92, the winners of the San Rafael -- Mister Frisky, Dinard and A.P. 
Indy -- also won the Santa Anita Derby. In 1986, Ferdinand lost by a 
half-length to Variety Road in the San Rafael, then won the Kentucky Derby 2 
1/2 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan's sire, Ogygian, was one of the early favorites for the 1986 
Kentucky Derby, having won all three of his races as a 2-year-old by a 
cumulative 20 1/2 lengths. New Yorkers were hyping him as the best since 
Spectacular Bid, but Ogygian was seldom ready to run in the big races. He 
missed the Breeders' Cup Juvenile because of sore shins he didn't even get to 
the Derby preps because of an injury suffered when he kicked a paddock rail at 
his farm. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ogygian did run, he usually ran fast and usually won, but there was no 
proof from seven victories in 10 starts that he would have been effective 
beyond a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogygian's progeny don't seem to be long-winded, either. Ramblin Guy, a 
multiple stakes winner as a 2-year-old, showed early speed in the San Vicente 
before finishing last. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry, who trains Ramblin Guy, also started out caring for Fly'n J. Bryan. 
The colt was entered in a race last summer at Hollywood Park but was scratched 
when he wrenched an ankle. In the fall, through a recommendation by Tom 
Cavanagh, Fenley switched trainers and gave Fly'n J. Bryan to Peterson, who 
also trains for Cavanagh. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan has gone through the sales ring twice. As a yearling, he was 
sold at a Keeneland auction for $40,000. Five months later, as an unraced 
2-year-old at Calder, Fly'n J. Bryan was bought for $110,000 by Mayberry for 
Fenley, who after withdrawing from his airline freight business in Los Angeles 
decided to invest in horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan is the first, and in that respect Fenley is trying to copy 
something Fred Hooper did in 1945. Hooper won the Kentucky Derby with the first 
horse he ever owned, and Hoop Jr., a $10,000 yearling purchase, was also named 
after the owner's son. Hooper, 96, is still looking for that second Derby 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Not having raced at 2, Fly'n J. Bryan is bucking tremendous odds. The only 
horse to win the Derby after not making his debut until 3 has been Apollo, who 
won the eighth running at Churchill Downs in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
 Short on experience, Fly'n J. Bryan is long on sang-froid . "There's something 
different about this horse," Peterson said. "He's got the head of an older 
horse. That attitude and disposition are bound to help him. He's got the body 
of a 3-year-old and the mind of a 5-year-old. The big question, of course, is 
how far he'll run. Some horses wind up outrunning their pedigrees, and we hope 
that he's one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson trained Seattle Slew in the year after the colt swept the Triple 
Crown for trainer Billy Turner in 1977. Seattle Slew won the Marlboro Cup and 
the Woodward Stakes for Peterson, earning an Eclipse Award as the best older 
horse in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Shackled by drug and alcohol dependency, Peterson reached the nadir of his 
career in the early 1980s. He became sober and worked his way back, taking 
various jobs such as a clerk for race entries at Los Alamitos. Four years ago, 
Peterson had a contender for the classics, but Nuits St. Georges broke down 
while running in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 41, warmed to the mention of Nuits St. Georges. "That horse was sold 
recently in Kentucky for $2,000," Peterson said. "I hope they give him a nice 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Five other horses -- Tabasco Cat, Flying Sensation, Fumo di Londra, Powis 
Castle and Shepherd's Field -- are expected to run against Fly'n J. Bryan in 
the San Rafael. . . . Bien Bien, the high weight at 120 pounds, is expected to 
be entered today for the Santa Anita Handicap, and then his owners and trainer 
will decide whether to run Saturday. Other probables are Hill Pass, Kissin 
Kris, Region, The Wicked North, Stuka, Nonproductiveasset and Myrakalu. . . . 
Laabity, the $1.3-million yearling who was second to Fly'n J. Bryan in a maiden 
race, ran third Wednesday at Golden Gate Fields. . . . Jockey Pat Valenzuela 
begins a five-day suspension today, the result of his mount being disqualified 
from second to third place in a race last Saturday. . . . Dramatic Gold, winner 
of the Bradbury at Santa Anita, is going to run in the Florida Derby a week 
from Saturday, according to reports from Gulfstream Park.

2ND CHANCE, 2ND LOSS FOR CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleveland High lost its second chance in the second quarter Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by one with three minutes left in the first half in a 4-A City 
Section semifinal, Dorsey scored seven consecutive points, didn't trail again 
and went on to a 70-59 victory before 1,000 at Crenshaw High. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland was eliminated from the playoffs by Carson last Friday, but the City 
section ruled Carson used an ineligible player in the game. The Cavaliers were 
reinstated to the playoffs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland (14-9) used a trapping press to stay with the Dons for the entire 
game, forcing seven turnovers in the third quarter, but not getting closer than 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jermaine Hall scored 12 of his 18 points in the final quarter, helping pull 
Cleveland to within 52-49 with 4 1/2 minutes left, but Dorsey hit eight of 11 
free throws to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough because we didn't have a lot of practice," Cleveland forward 
Randolph Henry (10 points) said. "We just had to out there and play hard. They 
were just a little better shooting and rebounding." 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting came in the form of guard Shewyn Morgan, who scored 17 points for 
Dorsey (18-8). Forward Jovan Colbert added eight points and 12 rebounds, seven 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know what to expect; we hadn't played (Cleveland) since early in 
the season," Colbert said. "We were preparing for Carson, we were used to them, 
but (the Cavaliers) were very different and better than in December." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey beat Cleveland in December, but the teams hadn't met since. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had to rely on help from the bench as physical play led to early 
foul trouble. Cleveland's Jimmy Harris picked up his fourth foul a minute into 
the second half and didn't play the rest of the game. Henry gave the Cavaliers 
a boost off the bench with 10 points, and Rasheem Smith played point guard for 
nearly the entire second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons had help as well off the bench. Jason Hawzell scored eight of his 10 
points in the first half and sophomore center Charles Johnson added seven 
points before fouling out midway though the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of grabbing and holding going on," Cleveland center Louis 
Fernandez (14 points) said. "Whenever I tried to get free, my jersey was 
grabbed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey will play Southern league rival Crenshaw for the championship Saturday.

VENTURA PULLS AWAY IN SECOND HALF; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PIRATES DEFEAT RANCHO 
SANTIAGO, 95-66, AFTER TRAILING AT HALFTIME OF SECOND-ROUND REGIONAL GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anybody who is serious about beating the Ventura College men's basketball team 
should put the Pirates away when they have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't, the consequences can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates trailed in double-digits in the first half before going on a 
rampage after intermission and routing Rancho Santiago, 95-66, in a 
second-round game of the Southern California regional playoffs before 3,400 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (33-2) advances to a third-round game at home Saturday night against 
Imperial Valley, an 81-75 winner over Cerritos on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura defeated Rancho Santiago in the second round for the second 
consecutive year. But the Pirates, seeded No. 1 in the regional, had to rally 
in the second half after trailing, 41-40, at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were mentally out of it," Ventura Coach Philip Mathews said. "We knew they 
were very good defensively. We knew we had to do certain things offensively but 
we didn't do them." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Pirates did was commit seven turnovers in the first 10 minutes. They 
fell behind, 16-5, with 14 minutes 40 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (21-12) took advantage of the Ventura mistakes, and forward 
Matt Kordik scored 17 of his 21 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mathews switched defensive assignments on Kordik after halftime, taking 
forward Brandon Jessie off the 6-foot-7 sophomore and assigning guards D'Mitri 
Rideout and Tracy Lundy to rotate in tailing Kordik. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked to near perfection. Kordik managed only four points in the second 
half as the Pirates cranked up the pace and routed Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out slow," Jessie said. "(Mathews) said the guy was kicking my butt. I 
accepted the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to guard Kordik, Jessie took out his wrath on the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore made nine of 11 shots in the second half (including two 
three-point baskets) and a free throw for 21 of his game-high 26 points. After 
Ventura guard Joey Ramirez opened the scoring in the second half with a 
three-point basket, Jessie scored the next 10 points for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez finished with 18 points and Steve Amar added 17. Center Michael Tate 
had a game-high 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Sean Amos had 24 points for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are bigger and stronger than we are," said Dana Pagett, the Rancho 
Santiago coach. "They just wore us down."

<P>
 The opportunity for Cypress to win a league championship might never be 
better. Esperanza, El Dorado and Katella--the dominant teams in recent 
years--are a bit down and the Centurions have plenty of talent. After 
back-to-back third-place finishes, this could be their year. They have an 
anchor in Brito, who was a Times Orange County selection as a freshman. He hit 
.542, which was second in the county, and had four home runs and 33 runs batted 
in. He's bigger and stronger this season, but the Centurions won't depend on 
one player. Also back is Flanagan, who was 7-1 during the regular season, and 
Larsen, who was 3-2, but beat El Dorado in the finale to clinch a playoff spot. 
Both were all-league selections. Martin moves from catcher to shortstop this 
season. He also is a solid No. 2 hitter. Bratcher will take Martin's spot 
behind the plate. Rios gives them more depth on the mound. There are holes to 
fill, for sure. But the time could be right for the Centurions to step up in 
class.

NBA ROUNDUP; HOME NO HELP FOR CELTICS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parquet floor didn't matter. The mystique is gone, leaving Boston Celtic 
remnants who last won in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price led five teammates in double figures Wednesday night as Cleveland 
won its eighth game in a row, 110-96, over the Celtics, who stretched a losing 
streak into a second month and a 13th game. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who had 32 points and 10 assists, had 13 points in the first quarter. 
Boston never led after Robert Parish scored the first basket of the game on an 
eight-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hot. And when you feel that way, you just go with it," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Douglas had 25 points and Jimmy Oliver 17 for the Celtics, who have 
been as cold as a New England winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Hill scored 22 points, Gerald Wilkins 14 and John Williams 13 for 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 After Parish's jump shot, the Cavaliers scored the next nine points to take 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Price had an all-world game," Celtic Coach Chris Ford said. "Our defense was 
lacking early in the game. They were hitting wide-open jumpers and taking the 
ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd expect things to be different at home after our road trip, but they 
weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 131, Detroit 107 -- Clyde Drexler scored 20 of his 28 points in the 
second half when the Trail Blazers outscored the Pistons, 73-43, at Auburn 
Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the seventh in eight games for Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 106, San Antonio 96 -- Karl Malone scored 24 points and Jeff Hornacek 23 
at San Antonio, where the Jazz continued its recent success against top teams 
and won its seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 108, Minnesota 100 -- Steve Smith scored eight of the Heat's 11 overtime 
points as Miami blew a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter but won at 
Minneapolis.

 New faces should emerge in the sprints, but Stanford again is expected to 
dominate the three-day Pacific 10 Conference men's swimming championships, 
which open today at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The field is wide open in the 50-yard freestyle today and the 100 freestyle 
Saturday.The top swimmer is Cardinal senior Bill Schell, who finished third in 
the both events last year. Other contenders are teammate Joe Hudepohl, second 
in the 100 freestyle last year, and UCLA's Kyle Depold. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin Sven Hackmann could challenge Arizona State's Cristiano Michelena, the 
defending Pac-10 champion in the 500 freestyle and 1,650 freestyle, in both 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, the defending NCAA champion, will be trying to win its 13th 
consecutive Pac-10 title. Its swimmers will be defending six individual titles: 
Trip Zedlitz in the 200 individual medley today; Hudepohl in the 200 freestyle, 
Derek Weatherford in the 100 backstroke and Tyler Mayfield in the 100 
breaststroke Friday, and Kurl Grote in the 200 breaststroke and Weatherford the

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: SUDDENLY, SAM RETURNS TO RIDE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Ermolenko, world and national speedway motorcycle champion from Cypress 
known as Sudden Sam because of his fast reactions, just keeps coming back from 
one accident after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Ermolenko, who took a career-threatening spill last Oct. 28 in England, will 
return to the track Saturday night when the Coors Light Spring Classic opens 
the 26th speedway season at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa -- the 
same track where he won the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stories that came out of England were a bit exaggerated about how badly 
hurt I was," Ermolenko said after arriving in Southern California from his home 
in Hatton, England. "My right leg had two clean breaks, one on the shin and one 
on the femur, and I had a cracked vertebra in my back. I was in the hospital 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then, I've been in the gym, either here or in England, nearly every 
day. It's been a long haul, but I think I'm ready for a few laps." 
</P>
<P>
 Ermolenko, 33, who joined Bruce Penhall as the only American riders to win 
both the world and national titles in the same year, will not be part of the 
regular competition Saturday night, but will ride in several exhibition match 
races during the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm OK, but I'm not 100%, by any means," he said. "I can walk and can almost 
run, and I'm strong enough to ride. I hope to be ready when the (British 
Speedway League) season starts March 21." 
</P>
<P>
 Ermolenko is captain of the Wolverhampton Wolves and was the leading scorer in 
the British League last year before being injured in a spill on his home track 
two races from the end of the season. With their star rider out, the Wolves 
lost the season-deciding match in a tiebreaker with Bellevue. Two other 
Americans, Bobby Ott and Shawn Moran, rode for Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to winning the world championship at Pocking, Germany, and the 
national title a month later in Costa Mesa, Ermolenko was a member of the 
United States' winning World Cup team and with Ronnie Correy was a runner-up in 
the World Pairs competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hurt real bad last October, but the accident was nowhere near the worst 
I've had," Ermolenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Ermolenko was hit by a car and spent two months in the hospital 
recuperating from a broken shoulder and elbow and crushed thighbone. A year 
later, riding in a motocross, he fell and ruptured his spleen. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, after having switched from motocross to speedway racing, he fell 
during an international race in Denmark and broke a wrist and an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he fell during the world long-track championship and was hit by a 
trailing motorcycle in what was his worst accident. One leg was broken in three 
places, and surgeons worked seven hours piecing it back together. He was in the 
hospital for four weeks and did not ride again for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other former national champions -- Bobby Schwartz, Brad Oxley and Mike 
Faria -- will be in Saturday night's field, along with four Southland riders 
who compete in the British League -- Greg Hancock, Josh Larson, Billy Hamill 
and Dukie Ermolenko, Sam's younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular weekly Friday night speedway season at Costa Mesa will open on 
April 1. 
</P>

 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Jeff Purvis, 35, of Clarksville, Tenn., was named to take over 
the Winston Cup ride of his late friend, Neil Bonnett, who died in a crash last 
month at Daytona International Speedway. Purvis will enter eight races in 
Bonnett's Chevrolet Lumina, owned by James Finch. 
</P>
<P>
 HONORS -- Ten new members have been elected to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of 
America: Bobby Unser, open-wheel; Cale Yarborough, stock cars; Bob Glidden,

Desert series, is scheduled for Saturday near Barstow. Racing will start at 9 
a.m. from the Sidewinder exit off I-15. . . . The KCR Challenge winter series 
for stock cars at Kern County Raceway in Willow Springs will end Sunday with 
IMCA Grand American and sportsman cars sharing the spotlight. . . . Dave 
Simpson, an auto parts salesman from Alta Loma, will be one of four drivers 
competing this weekend near Istanbul, Turkey, for the right to represent the 
United States in the 15th annual Camel Trophy Adventure next month in South 
America. Two will be chosen for the 20-day rally.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: KERNEN FINDS RELIEF WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The struggles of the Cal State Northridge baseball team's pitching rotation 
may have a silver lining: The relief corps, which historically hasn't received 
much work, has performed well. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Orr, Aaron D'Aoust and Jason Vargas have allowed seven earned runs in 24 
innings. The total includes a spot start by Orr against Ohio State, in which he 
allowed three earned runs in seven innings, and a spot start by Vargas in a 6-4 
victory over Cal Baptist Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 All three are right-handed junior college transfers. Vargas hasn't allowed a 
baserunner in two innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge usually finishes near the top of the heap in complete games among 
NCAA Division I teams. Through 14 games, starters have completed eight starts. 
In 1993, Matador starters completed 31 of 56 games. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Northridge has some options. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that we have some guys who can contribute," Coach Bill Kernen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (5-9) finished the Florida Gator Slug-Fest a bit tattered, but also 
battle-tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were exposed to some adverse conditions -- namely in a 14-2 loss 
to host Florida before more than 2,200 raucous fans -- that should help the 
team grow. Northridge finished the tournament with a 1-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I hope the players take with them is that we played against teams that 
are some of the best in the nation," Kernen said. "We held our own in a hostile 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they'll look around and say, 'Hey, we belong in this mix.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Shanahan's six-hit outburst in Sunday's doubleheader against Ohio State 
was a bit mystifying. He entered the game batting .182 with three runs batted 
-- all on a three-run homer against Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game started at 9:30 a.m. Maybe it was the coffee. Or the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had French toast -- the same thing I've had every day," Shanahan said. "So 
it definitely wasn't that." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan, a junior and a returning starter, banged out six hits in the two 
games and added three RBIs. Even though Shanahan had been struggling, Kernen 
inserted him in the cleanup spot Saturday against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel personally that that's where I should be," Shanahan said. "I know I've 
struggled, but I'm still confident in myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Northridge begins Western Athletic Conference play March 11 with a 
three-game series at home against Hawaii. The Rainbows are probably the team to 
beat in the West Division. Hawaii (12-6) is the only WAC team ranked (19th) by 
Collegiate Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If it works, don't fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed to be the credo Matador softball Coach Gary Torgeson used to guide 
his team to the championship of the Fabulous Four tournament in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round, Kathy Blake shut out Cal, 2-0; Jen Richardson beat Santa 
Clara, 13-0, on a two-hitter; and Amy Windmiller beat San Jose State, 1-0, on a 
one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did Torgeson do in the second round of the round-robin tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing different. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake downed Cal again, 1-0; Richardson tossed another two-hitter against 
Santa Clara, winning, 3-0; and Windmiller again faced San Jose State, although 
this time CSUN lost, 1-0. The Master's 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Penberthy is the Mustangs' fifth-leading scorer (9.4) this season, but he 
could play a major role in the team's quest to make the NAIA basketball 
playoffs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 freshman from Fresno Hoover High averaged 17 points in the last 
five games of the regular season while shooting 62.0% from the field and 59.1% 
from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Penberthy has rung up big numbers against overmatched opponents -- 
Master's won four of its last five games by an average of 50.5 points -- he 
also scored 15 points in the second half of a 88-84 loss to Biola on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's just getting more comfortable and more familiar with our 
offense," Coach Bill Oates said. "He's starting to know where the shots are 
going to come from." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rogerio Soares missed the final two games of the regular season with an 
injured left knee and is listed as questionable for Friday's game against 
Christian Heritage in the first round of the NAIA Far West Region Independents 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Soares, a 6-foot-6 junior from Brazil, is averaging only 7.0 points and 2.8 
rebounds per game, but he is an integral part of Master's eight-man rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The term hard-luck pitcher can be defined in two words: Matt Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander was the losing pitcher twice last week through no 
fault of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday against Cal State Dominguez Hills, Davis tossed a four-hitter and 
lost, 1-0. On Saturday against Pt. Loma Nazarene, he was the loser when the 
Mustangs committed two errors in the 13th inning to drop a 4-3 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting good pitching all year," Coach Chris Harrison said "We're 
just not playing solid defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the luck of Davis finally is changing. On Monday, the Mustangs hammered 
Cal Lutheran, 13-3, and Davis was the winning pitcher. Cal Lutheran 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran's three-game series with LaVerne for first place in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference baseball standings turned into a 
mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
 LaVerne's bats were no competition for Cal Lutheran's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Arroyo tossed a three-hit shutout as the Kingsmen downed LaVerne, 2-0, in 
Friday's opener. Then Marc Weiss nearly matched the performance with a 
complete-game four-hitter, blanking LaVerne, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nightcap, LaVerne managed five hits -- and a few runs -- but still 
lost, 5-3. Around the Campuses . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Master's forward James Mosley has been on a shooting tear, making 49 of 80 
shots (61.3%) and 12 of 18 (66.7%) three-pointers in the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Erin Bailey of Cal State Northridge moved to sixth on the all-time school 
list in the men's long jump when he leaped 24 feet 7 inches to win that event 
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation indoor championships at the Reno 
(Nev.) Livestock and Events Center on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teresa Stricklin of Cal State Northridge won her second consecutive women's 
shotput title in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championships with a 
mark of 46-10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tyrone Gayles set a Cal State Northridge record of 62-7 1/2, which was good 
enough for third place in the 35-pound weight throw at the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation championships. Gayles' mark -- which improved his previous 
school mark by 2 1/2 feet -- exceeded the provisional qualifying standard for 
this month's NCAA championships.

 It was a tough first year for Lappin. "We were a bunch of young pups and we 
got whipped," he said. Things should be better this season. Heck, even last 
season ended well. The Saxons beat El Dorado near the end of the season to 
avoid going winless in league play. They also scored eight runs in the seventh 
inning in the league finale against second-place Los Alamitos. They still lost, 
12-11. But Loara does return seven starters, who should help improve on last 
season's record. "We'll be better and we'll be competitive," Lappin said. 
Boomsma was a second-team all-league selection. Roncevich will probably be the 
No. 1 starter. Ortiz will get the first shot at the No. 2 slot. Ortiz played 
center field last season, but didn't pitch because he was coming off arm 
problems. He threw well over the summer. Ortiz and Hoffman were also 
second-team all-league selections. Hoffman is in his fourth year on the varsity 
and has been a starter at catcher the past two seasons. Kirkland, a reserve as 
a freshman last season, will be a key at shortstop.

 Bryant takes over this season, succeeding Rob Megill who resigned. Bryant 
played baseball at Cal State Fullerton and was a starter on the Titans' 
national championship team in 1984. He inherits a team that could do even 
better than its second-place finish of last season. They have a good nucleus of 
players and a terrific transfer in Bozman, who was at Bellflower a year ago. 
Bozman was a Times Orange County first-team selection as a running back in 
football and many believe his best sport is baseball. He is a solid hitter and 
has good speed. The infield is solid with Barnett, Blackledge and Taylor, who 
all are returning starters. Taylor hit .410 and scored 22 runs. Barnett, a 
starter since his sophomore season, had a team-high 26 runs batted in. He also 
scored 25 runs and had 18 stolen bases. The Griffins have a good group of young 
players to mix in. A lot will depend on pitchers Campbell and Cunningham. Both 
were on the varsity last season, so they have some experience. But one will 
have to step forward and be the ace. If one or both come through, then the 
Griffins will be tough to beat.

 Finished a disappointing fifth last season after going 9-2 in nonleague play. 
The Knights do have a quality player in Wright, son of former Angel Clyde 
Wright. Baseball America lists Wright as the fourth-best high school prospect 
in the nation. He hit .451 with seven home runs and 26 runs batted in. Problem 
is, there's no one who can keep teams from pitching around Wright. He'll be 
more effective on the mound. Wright was 5-4 with 80 strikeouts and was named 
second-team All-Division I. Rojo returns as his catcher and Park is back at 
second base. David Reese, Mike Stevenson and Mike Villegas are seniors and one 
of them probably will end up as the No. 2 starter. The question is which one? 
For better or worse, they are all equal heading into the season. The Knights 
are depending on players with only junior varsity experience. A lot lower 
expectations this season, but, when Wright is on the mound, the Knights will be 
tough.

 The Golden Hawks missed the playoffs last season, a rarity. They had qualified 
in five of the previous six seasons. El Dorado should return this season. The 
Golden Hawks return four players who were first-team all-league 
selections--Cuevas, Flores, Moore and Reyes. Flores was 8-3 last season and is 
one of the top pitchers in the county. Reyes is an outstanding leadoff hitter. 
The infield should be solid, with Cuevas and Moore returning. The team has a 
good mixture of experience. A key will be how well Patterson develops at 
catcher. Because of injuries last season, the Golden Hawks went through three 
catchers, which hampered their pitching and allowed other teams to run wild. 
Patterson is talented, but he's a sophomore. Mike Castillo is another sophomore 
the Golden Hawks will depend on heavily. It might be a bit much to expect El 
Dorado to win the league title, but the playoffs are reachable.

 Not much chance of the Aztecs equaling last season's success. But then, there 
wasn't much left to win a year ago. Esperanza advanced to its fourth section 
title game in seven seasons and won its second Division V-A title. The Aztecs 
beat Encino Crespi, then ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today, in the 
semifinals and Simi Valley, then ranked No. 1, in the final. Those are fond 
memories and the Aztecs might have to cling to them. Only two starters return. 
Murrietta has had to battle back from a knee injury suffered in football. When 
healthy, Murrietta is a dangerous hitter. He led the county in batting average 
during the regular season and hit .531 overall with 25 runs batted in. Webb hit 
.262 and drove in seven runs. Hild spent much of the season injured, but 
returned in time for the playoffs. He was 1-0 with a save and a 1.86 earned-run 
average. Hild will now have to become the ace. Viscusi hit .277 while splitting 
time in the outfield. Quezada had only 10 at-bats. The rest of the team has no 
varsity experience. The Aztecs will probably make the playoffs. They might even 
challenge for the league title. But another title will take a lot of doing. 
But, hey, they will always have last season. Curran has even made a highlight 
tape.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; FRESNO STATE TAKES THE AIR OUT OF TITAN OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, the nation's top-ranked baseball team in two polls, was 
held to four hits and host Fresno State beat the Titans, 5-2, in a 
nonconference game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Minor (3-2) pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs and 
striking out six. Fresno State is 6-8; Fullerton 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were coming off an impressive weekend during which they beat 
Georgia Tech and Oklahoma on the way to winning the Anaheim Hilton & Towers 
tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 The victories gave Fullerton the top spot in the nation, according to 
Collegiate Baseball Magazine and USA Today. Baseball America has Fullerton No. 
2 behind Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Things started well for Fullerton on Wednesday when lead-off hitter Dante 
Powell hit a home run, his fifth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Titans didn't score again until Brian King opened the ninth with his 
second home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had the tying run at the plate with one out in the ninth, but 
pinch-hitter Sal Mancuso lined into a game-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State tied the score at 1 on a home run by James Borges in the second. 
The Bulldogs added two runs in the fourth against starter Jon Ward (0-1). 
Fresno got two unearned runs in the sixth off reliever Chad Rolish. 
</P>
<P>
 In other nonconference baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco State 10, Concordia 1 -- Concordia (3-8) fell behind 10-0 after 
six innings as six San Francisco State pitchers held the Eagles hitless after 
Alex Vicario led off the game with a base hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Daniel got the loss for Concordia, giving up 10 runs and seven hits in 
four innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's first-round Golden State Athletic Conference playoffs: 
</P>
<P>
 Point Loma Nazarene 72, Concordia 71 -- Center Lori Carper scored 24 points 
for Point Loma Nazarene in its upset victory. At the end of the first half, 
Concordia was leading by four points and could not fend off Point Loma's strong 
second-half play. Gitte Mejer had 29 points for Concordia (15-13). 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Christian 80, California Baptist 57 -- Snaja Simidzija had 
22 points and 14 rebounds and Jamie Zitterkopf had 11 points and 12 rebounds 
for Southern California College in the first round of the conference playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards will travel to Azusa Pacific for a second-round game Friday at 
7:30 p.m.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL; BENCHING WAKES UP WHITLOCK, AND SADDLEBACK WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback basketball Coach Bill Brummel wasn't pleased with the effort of 
several of his players in the first half of the Gauchos' Southern California 
men's playoff game against visiting Rio Hondo Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his point with Tes Whitlock by banishing the team's leading scorer to 
the bench for the final five minutes of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think Tes was playing very hard," Brummel said. "Everyone needs to 
be jogged a little at times." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock took the benching to heart and scored 19 points in the second half to 
help Saddleback to a 66-54 victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (23-8) advanced to play Saturday at Long Beach State in the final 
round of regional play. The winner advances to the State tournament, which 
starts next Thursday at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock finished with a game-high 26 points. He was nine of 15 from the field 
but made only six of 12 free throws. He entered the game averaging 21 points.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was my wake-up call," Whitlock said about being benched. "I knew Coach 
was a little upset with the way we were playing. To me it was like, 'Pick it up 
or you're going to be turning in your uniform.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback led, 32-29, at the break, but the Gauchos were a much sharper unit 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock made a lay-in off a give-and-go from Antoine Jefferson to give 
Saddleback a 32-43 lead with eight minutes 43 seconds left. At that point, he 
had scored five of his team's first 21 second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock added two free throws to put Saddleback ahead, 56-43, with 5:26 left. 
Rio Hondo, which has been eliminated from the playoffs by Saddleback the last 
three seasons, never got closer than 10 points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback also displayed its skill at using the clock late in the game. The 
Gauchos worked the ball around for 34 seconds before Derrick Walsh missed a 
three-point try with 2:38 left. Jefferson got the rebound and Saddleback again 
started to move the ball around. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Josh Borella got open off a screen with one second on the shot 
clock and made an 18-footer to put the Gauchos up, 63-49, with 2:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson (11 rebounds), Walsh and Eric Ambrozich each scored 10 points for 
Saddleback. Ambrozich, who fouled out, was the only Saddleback starter to come 
out in the second half. Saddleback switched to a zone defense for much of the 
second half in an effort to stay out of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was sort our plan," Brummel said about leaving his players in. "We 
looked at them and they didn't look that tired." 
</P>
<P>
 In other playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 95, Rancho Santiago 66 -- Visiting Rancho Santiago (21-12) was 
eliminated by top-seeded Ventura (33-2) for the second consecutive year. Sean 
Amos had 24 and Matt Kordik added 21 for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Jessie, a former Edison High School standout, scored a team-high 26 
for Ventura. He also had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City 96, Fullerton 79 -- Kevin Carlson had 18 points as visiting 
Fullerton ended its season 24-11.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; GRANT GAINS SOCCER FINAL AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Grant High girls' soccer team advanced to its second second consecutive 
City Section championship game with a 2-0 semifinal victory over Granada Hills 
Wednesday, but the Lancers won't be facing the team they expected in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers were hoping to avenge last season's title-match defeat to 
Chatsworth, but the Chancellors lost to San Pedro in the other semifinal.  
</P>
<P>
 Grant (11-3-2) will play the Pirates Saturday at noon at East L.A. College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sort of looking forward to the rematch," Grant Coach John Robb said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we'll be happy to focus on San Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant juniors Nicole Bucciarelli and Jamie Jacobs each scored a second-half 
goal at Granada Hills (10-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers and the Highlanders tied, 1-1, in Valley Conference play earlier 
this season and were tied again, 0-0, at halftime in their rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 But five minutes into the second half, Bucciarelli scored after a corner kick 
by Katy Walzer, and 13 minutes later assisted on Jacobs' insurance goal.  
</P>
<P>
 Bucciarelli has 43 goals and 13 assists this season.

SAN PEDRO STUNS CHATSWORTH, 2-1; GIRLS' PLAYOFF SOCCER: CHANCELLORS STOPPED IN 
SEMIFINALS, ERASING BID FOR SIXTH CONSECUTIVE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Losing was inevitable, probably, but when it finally happened to the 
Chatsworth High girls' soccer team, it was nonetheless shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning all five championships since City Section play began in 1989, 
Chatsworth's pressure-filled quest for a sixth was ended by San Pedro in a 
Wednesday semifinal. Pirate forward Danica Holt scored with six minutes 
remaining in overtime to hand the Chancellors their first-ever defeat in City 
play, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great few years," said Jack Sidwell, a Chatsworth assistant who 
has been a part of four of the team's championships. "But all good things must 
come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro's Holt said that her team -- which lost to Chatsworth by six goals 
in a preseason practice match -- knew about the Chancellors' remarkable streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was about time they lost," she said. "We pushed hard and we 
really wanted it. It feels great." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Chatsworth players were in tears after the match, consoling each other as 
they disassembled the goals and nets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you want to break down and cry," said sophomore Kim Pickup, who 
proceeded to do just that. "We should have put more into practice. We didn't 
take it seriously enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Said goalkeeper Tawni Takaga: "We weren't even thinking about the semis. We 
were just thinking finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Their minds appeared to be elsewhere early in the match. In the 12th minute, 
San Pedro (12-4) was awarded a free kick six yards from the Chatsworth goal 
because goalkeeper Takaga picked up a pass from her own player, which is 
against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably a mental mistake on my behalf," Takaga said. "I could have 
dribbled it. But there is so much gray area (in the rule's interpretation). The 
pass was intended for my sweeper but it went by her." 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro's Nicole DeLuca scored on the short kick to make it 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (14-1-1) tied the match in the second half on a difficult 15-yard 
shot by sophomore Michele George, but missed several opportunities to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the fourth minute of the second 10-minute overtime period, Holt ended a 
dynasty by heading a perfect corner kick from DeLuca into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much pressure (not to be the first team to lose)," Chancellor 
sophomore Michele Charles said. "It hurts even more that we lost for the 
Chatsworth program."

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: A TIME FOR SONGS, FOR JOY, FOR SORROW

<P>
 As the lights dimmed and the curtain rose, the passion of Zlata Lyashkevich at 
the piano filled the room with the music of Moshe and Rose Gershovitz's boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The music was a fitting overture to a program dedicated to Russian Jewish 
artists and writers killed under Josef Stalin's dictatorship, as it was 
composed by this son of Russian Jewish immigrants -- Jacob Gershovitz. We know 
him as George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
 The music: "Rhapsody in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in this audience of about 250 were white-haired; they had lived in 
Stalin's Russia. For them, this Sunday afternoon gathering at the Westside 
Jewish Community Center was at once joyous and sorrowful. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Vera Pauker, who came to America in 1980. Pauker, who's on 
staff at the center, dreams of a Russian theater in Los Angeles. "There are so 
many Russian Jewish singers and actors here, and they cannot find any work." 
</P>
<P>
 They include pianist Lyashkevich and bass Yuri Edelman, both 51, an artistic 
team for six years. They came from Moscow nine months ago. Lyashkevich, a 
graduate of Moscow Conservatory, teaches part time at California State 
University, Los Angeles, and plays at an Italian restaurant in Glendale. 
Edelman, who sang with the Moscow Philharmonic and in concerts and opera 
throughout Eastern Europe, is working as a carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lyashkevich says, in Russia things are far worse. "The artist's life is 
very hard now because of politics, the economy. Nobody goes to concerts. There 
is no money for tickets. We are not needed in our country." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, despite their considerable talents, is it any picnic here, where their 
names are not household words and English does not come easily to them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Arta Shess, 55, an Armenian, who arrived in 1992. A powerful baritone 
who sang major opera roles throughout Eastern Europe, he now is relegated 
largely to singing at venues such as senior-citizen centers. 
</P>
<P>
 For this audience, his songs needed no introduction. He sang first in Yiddish, 
about a rabbi. Then he sang Eli, Eli, a Hebrew prayer, throwing kisses to an 
audience that lured him back with a cadence of clapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he can sing in English, he says, "I have wonderful voice, but nobody 
knows me here." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman wishes that there was more call for a Russian-born singer with limited 
English. He will tell you that he is very happy to be in America and he is 
optimistic. His attitude seemed to echo the theme for the day, Nit Gedeiget, 
Yiddish for "Cheer up -- don't worry." 
</P>
<P>
 But the stage backdrop, a sort of mask of tragedy, was a grim reminder of the 
obliteration of Jewish culture and tradition in Russia during the '30s and 
'40s. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russian, narrator Ana Feldman, a former Moscow University professor, told 
the story of Solomon Mikhoels, creator of the Yiddish State Theater in Moscow 
in the '20s and its director until he died in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 The official line: The actor, an activist who also headed the Jewish 
Anti-Fascist Committee, died in a car accident. Many Jews, however, think he 
was murdered by the Soviet secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 46 years later, he was present in spirit on a scratchy recording from his 
most famous role, "King Lear." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our future is in the hands of our children," says Feldman, who then brought 
on seven boys and girls in blue and white -- the colors of Israel -- to perform 
a dance, L'Chaim ("To Life"). Still, none in this hall had forgotten the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman spoke with passion of the Soviet purges of the '40s, the arrests on 
trumped-up charges of hundreds of the Jewish cultural elite. "Every night 
people were expecting someone to come and arrest them." On Aug. 12, 1952, after 
secret trials, 24 Jews, among them poet Perets Markish and children's writer 
Lev Kvitko, were executed. 
</P>
<P>
 This concert was for remembering them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In his booming bass, Edelman, accompanied by Lyashkevich, sang in Yiddish 
about the search for peace and love and the good life. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, children brought flowers up to the artists, who led audience 
members -- now on their feet -- in singing, in Hebrew, Shalom Alechem . 
</P>
<P>
 Peace to you. 
</P>
<P>
 This program, with English interpretation, will be presented again at 2 p.m. 
March 20 at Westside Jewish Community Center, 5870 W. Olympic Blvd. One Good 
Turn Deserves Another 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11, 1992, Darlene Theakston and Marcus Magee -- his kidneys were 
deteriorating as a result of childhood-onset diabetes -- checked into St. 
Vincent's Hospital. They checked out a week later, with one of her kidneys at 
work in his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miracle," says Magee, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 He had hoped this would be an engagement of sorts, an unbreakable bond. But, 
alas, the romance fizzled. They remain good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Theakston, a 27-year-old jobless legal secretary -- and about 40,000 
others -- entered a drawing at the tribal-run Casino Morongo near Palm Springs. 
Guess who walked off with the expenses-paid trip for two to anywhere in the 
world -- plus $2,000 mad money? 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that two years earlier doctors had told her there was only a 
one-in-a-million chance that her kidney would be a match for Magee, Theakston 
has to wonder if she has "a direct line with God all of a sudden." Some would 
simply argue that one good deed deserves another. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-April, Theakston, who lives in Santa Monica, will fulfill a dream when 
she and Julie Jackson of Rancho Cucamonga travel to Egypt and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 She's feeling just fine. "I am missing a rib," she says, referring to the one 
surgeons removed to get to that kidney. The rib is in a jar in her closet.

INTO THE NIGHT / MARK EHRMAN: YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO PARTY, TOO

 The Scene: A no-expletives-deleted gathering at the Arena nightclub in 
Hollywood for "Banned Together," the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation 
of Southern California's Grammy night "celebration of artistic free expression" 
and benefit. The fete marks the second year of the ACLU's Generation X 
outreach. "At most of our events, we don't get many young people," explains 
ACLU executive director Ramona Ripston. "This is a way of getting the message 
to them about how important the Constitution is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Musical Roster: Competing with Garry Shandling and the awards ceremony 
(televised with nearly audible sound in the upstairs bar) was an indie-heavy, 
ultra-alternative lineup consisting of Bottom 12, Love Jones, Black Market 
Flowers and John Wesley Harding. The evening's headliner was the Seattle "riot 
grrrl" band, 7 Year Bitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The festivities were hosted by Yippie co-founder and venerable 
rabble-rouser Paul Krassner with guest appearances by twentyish 
actress/activist ("not an oxymoron," quipped Krassner) and "Melrose Place" star 
Daphne Zuniga. The crowd, which numbered around 500, was an even mix of 
strait-laced card-carrying liberals and sartorially-expressive Gen-X rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: A megacaloric, ultra-eclectic buffet, which included corned beef from 
the Stage Deli, Ed Debevic's burgers and fries, oysters from Orso, tamales 
courtesy of the Cobalt Cantina, Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, Starbucks Coffee, 
pastries from the Old Town Bakery -- just to name a few of the gastronomic 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "It's so easy for people to become insulated, close-minded, fearful 
and contracted," said Zuniga. "The more different people are allowed to express 
themselves, the easier it is for the rest of us to look and learn and feel 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Free Speech Award: Neo-folk singer John Wesley Harding who, before launching 
into his very topical set, announced, "I hate the Grammys. I always have." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Festive Party Favor: Departing guests received a card entitled "If You 
are Arrested" enumerating one's rights when in custody. You never know.  
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Admission was $25 per person, plus $5 for a food pass. On sale 
were "You Have the Right Not to Remain Silent" T-Shirts for $10 and ACLU mugs 
for $5. The evening's net was $10,000.

 High school students of Hispanic descent are invited to participate in a play 
commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 80-foot-long MEChA Mural at Nealley 
Library at Rancho Santiago Community College's Santa Ana campus.(A portion of 
the mural is pictured above.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago graduate Louie Olivos Jr. wrote the play about the mural and 
its creation two decades ago. The play will be performed during Cinco de Mayo 
festivities at the college. The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Atzlan is a 
student organization that focuses on Chicano culture and history. 
</P>
<P>
 Students interested in being in the play should call Olivos at (714) 543-5598. 
Rehearsals will be Tuesday evenings and Saturday mornings.

any, and take the test. Most people tend to stress out and do really bad, but I

test; I probably should have, but I haven't."

 Melissa Faber, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Villa Park

a lot the night before the test."

 Musical place mats for babies, an unparalleled travel manual, holders for 
eyeglasses and several handy household products are new this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Music to Eat By: Coming in mid-April are Musical Meals place mats to entertain 
infants in highchairs. They're made of washable vinyl and aren't loud enough to 
drive parents crazy. Babies start the music by pushing a microchip enclosed in 
an unopenable pouch. Introduced by Amy Kallman Epstein, who brought out the 
Read a Mat series of children's place mats 10 years ago, Musical Meals mats 
come with one of four songs: "London Bridge," "Mary Had a Little Lamb," "Old 
MacDonald" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." Each measures 8.5 x 13.5 inches 
and includes colorful drawings. Suggested retail is $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical Meals and Epstein's new Color a Mats, which come with crayons and a 
carrying case for about $5, will be available nationwide in selected toy, gift, 
book, linen and children's stores, or by calling Straight Edge at (800) 
READMAT. 
</P>
<P>
 Small Book, Big Tips: "The Authoritative Six Ounce Travel Encyclopedia" is a 
lengthy title for a little vinyl-covered manual that's the best on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The encyclopedia offers 144 pages of tips on trip planning, packing, home 
arrangements, first aid, travel with children and pets, and safety, as well as 
tables of temperatures in 223 U.S. and foreign cities, money units, time 
differences and electricity in 149 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also metric-conversion tables, maps, world air miles, international 
road signs, and telephone tips and area codes. The Picture Language section has 
236 drawings to help a traveler find items ranging from a Band-Aid to a beauty 
shop without speaking the language. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel Encyclopedia ($12.95) is available nationwide in bookstores, library 
shops, luggage and gift stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area, you can find it at Sport Chalet, Rand McNally Map and 
Travel stores, Vroman's in Pasadena, UCLA Bookstore and the downtown Los 
Angeles Public Library store. Or order by sending $12.95 plus $1.50 shipping 
and handling to Ready-Set-Go!, Box 6415, Shawnee Mission, Kan. 66206. 
</P>
<P>
 Gripping Stuff: Wearers of eyeglasses who have been looking for those great 
little Wedgees glasses retainers available five years ago need search no more. 
They have been reintroduced as Grippers, similar wedge-shaped sleeves that fit 
over each arm of the earpieces to keep glasses from slipping off. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft neoprene sleeves also cushion pressure. Grippers ($3.95 a pair, 
including shipping and handling) can be ordered from Grippers, 1623 Glorietta 
Blvd., Coronado, Calif. 92118; (619) 435-5675. They come in black or brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Bag Deal: The Bag Bag is a simple solution to an annoying kitchen problem: 
where to store plastic shopping bags. This 8-by-16-inch duffel allows you to 
store up to 60 bags and dispenses them one at a time. Made of non-shrinking 
unbleached cotton, Bag Bag hangs on a doorknob or a hook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bag Bag (suggested retail from $2.99 to $4.99) is available locally at 
Gelson's stores, Crown Hardware stores in Orange County or Farmers Market at 
Fashion Island in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also sold through several catalogues, among them Brookstone, (800) 
926-7000; Sears Shop at Home, (800) 438-8858, and Colonial Garden Kitchens, 
(800) 245-3399. Or order it ($3 plus $1 shipping) from the Bag Bag Corp. by 
calling (800) 847-8447. 
</P>
<P>
 No-Scratchers: 3M Co. has recently introduced Scotch-Brite Never Scratch Wool 
Soap Pads that will scour delicate kitchen surfaces and equipment -- stove 
tops, microwaves, non-stick cookware and glasses -- without scratching. 
</P>
<P>
 And kudos to 3M from the environment. The pads, which look like steel wool, 
are made from recycled plastic beverage bottles and include biodegradable 
phosphorous-free detergent. Even the packaging is made of recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Never Scratch Wool Soap Pads in Los Angeles at Lucky, Ralphs, Vons 
and Food 4 Less grocery stores. If you can't find them, call 3M's consumer hot 
line, (800) 362-4356. They retail at 75 cents for a package of four, and $1.25 
for eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning Made Simple: Nevr-Dull, a specially treated cloth, simplifies 
cleaning and shining of aluminum, brass, chrome, copper, gold, pewter, silver 
and steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed as a chrome cleaner by Eagle One, a Carlsbad manufacturer of 
auto-care products, Nevr-Dull can be used in your home, car or boat. Just tear 
off a small wad of the cloth, rub slowly over the metal surface and buff with a 
dry cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevr-Dull ($3.99 for a five-ounce can) is available nationwide at automotive 
stores. Locally, you can find it at Pep Boys and Chief Auto Parts.

CHECK IT OUT: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; 'MY FATHER, THE HERO' MAKES MODERN 
FAIRY TALE A SWEET DREAM; TEEN REVIEWS OF BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES AND OTHER THINGS 
OF INTEREST.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TARA BUDZYN and DANA LENETZ, Tara Budzyn and Dana Lenetz are students at 
Foothill High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana: Imagine being on a Caribbean island. The sun is shining, crystalline 
waves crash against the white sandy beaches, and the sounds of "Hey, Mon" and 
reggae music float harmoniously through the air. It is the ideal vacation 
except . . . your dad is with you! But for Katherine Heigl's character, Nicole, 
in the film "My Father, the Hero," going on vacation with her father is not a 
problem. In fact, it is the proverbial "blessing in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Speaking of blessings, don't forget to mention the appealing face of 
newcomer Dalton James who plays Ben, the local resident and hotel employee. 
Where did this guy come from -- my wildest dreams? 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Put your hormones on hold for a minute, Tara, so we can talk about the 
movie. The plot revolves around Nicole, who goes on vacation with her divorced 
father, Andre, who has lived in France for five years. Convinced that the 
vacation is going to be a complete disaster, Nikki complains during the entire 
trip, until she sees Ben. From then on, Nikki tries to capture Ben's attention 
and his heart. To impress him, Nicole almost sabotages her father's reputation 
and the entire vacation by telling Ben that her father is her lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: And the director almost sabotages the movie by ceasing to recognize that 
Heigl's character is supposed to be only 14. I just don't think the Frederick's 
of Hollywood bathing suit look is appropriate in this film. The thong bathing 
suit and mini-dress does, however, draw attention away from Heigl's weak 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Oh, Tara, you are such a cynic! Even though her acting will not win any 
Oscars, I think that she portrayed the conniving, boy-crazy teen-ager 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: To me, the only perfect thing in this movie is the stellar performance 
of Gerard Depardieu. He definitely earns his reputation as the most popular 
actor in France in his portrayal of the ever-patient, slightly zany, 
unselfishly loving father. His antics on water skis, the dance floor and the 
piano create spontaneous reaction out of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Of course, the mere presence of James is also perfect. Although he has 
that "Beverly Hills 90210/Melrose Place" look, he does create a compassionate, 
understanding and mysterious character that just does not exist in the teen-age 
species. But a girl can dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: I think everyone who sees this movie will have sweet dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara and Dana: We recommend seeing "My Father, the Hero" to those who love a 
good laugh, a fairy-tale ending and a great soundtrack. And of course, bring 
Dad along!

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: HUMOR, INNOCENCE STILL LIVE IN SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The violent news footage from Sarajevo somehow masks the resilience of those 
who have not been cut down by sniper fire and Serb artillery. How exactly does 
life go on amid chronic carnage and fear? 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Sarajevo writers and a teen-age girl are answering the question 
with books about the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sarajevo: Survival Guide" mimics the format and straightforward style of 
Michelin's tall, palm-sized Baedekers while serving as a grimly humorous 
archive of life in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was written in Sarajevo by FAMA, a group of artists and intellectuals. As 
their introduction states, the guidebook intends to take visitors through the 
city and teach them how to survive "without transportation, hotels, taxis, 
telephones, food, shops, heating, water, information, electricity." 
</P>
<P>
 Some excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
 "Water: The washing machine is a household appliance from some long-gone 
times. It has no function. The women of Sarajevo are again first-class 
laundresses. The only thing lacking is a battledore, lye soap and a clean river 
to wash what they have." 
</P>
<P>
 "Eating: Each person in Sarajevo is very close to an ideal macrobiotician, a 
real role model for the health-conscious, diet-troubled West . . . People are 
healthy, in spite of everything, for no one eats animal fat anymore, nor meat, 
nor cheese -- meals are made without eggs, without milk, onions, meat, 
vegetables. We eat a precious mix of wild imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gifts: A bottle of clean water, a candle, a bar of soap, shampoo, some garlic 
or an onion. Passionate love is expressed here by a handful of wood, a bucket 
of coal, a complete edition of books which lack humor and poetry. Could you 
spare some Vladimir Illyich Lenin? Last winter has proven that his books burn 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 15, Workman Publishing Co. will distribute 25,000 copies of 
"Sarajevo: Survival Guide," which are being printed in Croatia. The publisher 
will price the guide at $10 and donate all profits to FAMA and its work. 
</P>
<P>
 Out with far more publicity is "Zlata's Diary" (Viking), 13-year-old Zlata 
Filipovic's newly published chronicle of two years in the Sarajevo war zone. 
She will arrive in the United States on Sunday, where her itinerary will 
include visits to five cities and a string of media interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zlata's Diary" first appeared in a Croat edition published by UNICEF and has 
become a bestseller in France, where Zlata and her parents were able to 
resettle late last year. A spirited auction among more than a dozen publishers 
for the American rights ended with Viking's winning offer of $540,000. Film 
rights went for a reported $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Emotions stirred by an innocent in harm's way, as well as Zlata's exhaustive 
efforts on behalf of her book, should propel sales of the 200,000 copies Viking 
has printed. Early reviews in Publishers Weekly and the Los Angeles Times have 
been strong.  
</P>
<P>
 However, her work also received a dismissive knock in the New York Times this 
week ("An inauthentic, posturing quality prevails") that has prompted some 
publishing observers to suspect other book critics may feel the same way and 
ignore the diary, leaving it to the news pages rather than belittle a child. 
Chilling Talk From FBI Vet: Hire a driver and get a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the "bare minimum" advice to business executives and prominent people 
"of high risk" given by James Fox, the former head of the FBI's New York 
office. In his first effort as security columnist for Forbes FYI, a quarterly 
supplement sent to Forbes' 700,000-plus subscribers, the man who became a 
recognizable TV face after last year's World Trade Center bombing warns 
corporate types that they, too, might be kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are wealthy, or even look as if you have money, you are a potential 
victim," he says in the March 14 issue. Among Fox's tips: Don't use company 
titles when making hotel reservations . . . Vary jogging and commuting routes . 
. . Don't flaunt wealth.  
</P>
<P>
 Fox, who was in the FBI for 31 years, is known for tough talk. He recently 
retired after being suspended for making what were considered inappropriate 
public comments about the World Trade Center case.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WOMEN TRYING TO LIVE AS BEST THEY CAN; NAKED LADIES BY 
ALMA LUZ VILLANUEVA ; BILINGUAL PRESS, $22, 288 PAGES

 "Naked Ladies" is the second novel from poet Alma Luz Villanueva, author of 
"The UltraViolet Sky" and "Weeping Woman: La Llorana and Other Stories." The 
provocative title takes its name from a type of wild flowers called Naked 
Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are enough racy scenes for the reader who may judge the book by its 
cover alone. In the novel, Villanueva explores a variety of relationships: 
interracial, heterosexual and homosexual. She approaches each with sensitivity 
and passion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the novel we meet Alta, a 27-year-old Mexican-American 
woman and a mother of three. Alta is driving home when she sees a mugger trying 
to grab the purse of another young mother. The woman, even as she holds a baby 
in one hand, refuses to let go of her purse, and is screaming at the mugger. 
Across the street two men stand and do nothing as the woman struggles. 
Impulsively, Alta turns the wheels of her car and quickly rams her bumper into 
the man. He lets go of the purse and limps away. 
</P>
<P>
 The would-be victim, Katie, befriends Alta. And although she is white and 
well-off, and Alta is poor and Mexican-American, the two share the experience 
of being in abusive marriages as well as being young mothers. Across the 
boundaries, a friendship is formed. 
</P>
<P>
 During their first dinner together, with both of their families, Katie and 
Alta talk in the kitchen, while their husbands watch sports in the living room. 
As Doug, Katie's husband, continually summons the women to get him beers, both 
women grow more exasperated. " 'Here, give me the blessed beers so I can 
baptize him,' " says Alta, clearly the brave one. " 'So you can what?' " asks 
Katie. Alta goes into the living room, opens a beer and pours it over Doug's 
head. As Doug jumps into the shower, the women collapse in laughter. Race and 
economic class mean nothing when it boils down to people just being people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh, Alta's husband, is struggling with the notion of difference, however. 
When the novel begins, we see only that he goes on drunken binges, spending the 
paycheck Alta needs to run the household. What we eventually learn is that 
Hugh, the big, beefy steelworker, is a closet homosexual. By having married 
Alta and fathering children, he has the cloak of a family to protect him from 
the homophobia that runs rampant in the steelyard where he works. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Alta enters therapy, taking Hugh with her, and the truth emerges. When 
Hugh's lover tests positive for AIDS, Alta is devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most inspiring elements of this novel, published by the Bilingual 
Press at Arizona State University, is the wonderful portrayal of strong women. 
There is Katie, who wins the struggle for her purse, but loses a harrowing 
battle against breast cancer. There is Jade, an Asian-American teacher who must 
deal with harassment by a couple of local lowlifes. And there is Alta, always 
struggling to improve her situation and to be there for her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the teen-age pregnancy that forced her to marry Hugh, Alta goes back 
to school part time and ultimately gets her bachelor's degree. She becomes a 
counselor and falls in love with a colleague, Michael, an African-American man. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael is struggling with a history of racism and rage, but together he and 
Alta discover that, through love, they can move past the boundaries of 
ignorance and prejudice. Michael and Alta learn that although you cannot change 
the world, you can change the way you live in the world. And sometimes that is 
the most courageous act of all.

SOUNDS: VETERAN VIBES PLAYER GIBBS HITS HIGH NOTES; AT 69, AND WITH DOZENS OF 
ALBUMS BEHIND HIM, HE'S STILL GOING STRONG. HIS QUARTET WILL PLAY IN OJAI ON 
SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jazz veteran Terry Gibbs has a musical biography that spans the world. He's a 
vibes player and bandleader with three dozen albums and hundreds of tunes to 
his credit, boxes of awards and was Steve Allen's music director for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean that the 69-year-old Gibbs is ready to rest on his 
laurels. He's still attracted by a good gig, and good gigs can pop up in 
out-of-the-way places. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Gibbs heads up the hill to Ojai's Wheeler Hot Springs, where his 
quartet will provide the next event in the restaurant's ongoing series of jazz 
dinner concerts. Joining Gibbs will be longtime associates Frank Capp on drums, 
Tom Ranier on piano and Dave Carpenter on bass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wheeler connection is also a family connection. Gibbs' son Gerry, a 
drummer, played there last month, with saxophonist Joe Henderson, and raved 
about the room to his father. The elder Gibbs saw an opportunity to make one of 
his rare appearances in the area while taking advantage of an intimate setting 
for a quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a recent phone interview from his home in the San Fernando Valley, 
Gibbs, fearful of being misquoted, asked the reporter if he was using a tape 
recorder. The interviewee's concern isn't surprising: It would take a 
note-taker of virtuosic dexterity to keep up with his rapid-fire patter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the job, whether behind his vibes or navigating a big band, Gibbs has a 
similar amicable intensity. He won't be accused of being a restless innovator, 
but Gibbs articulates with a focused energy and a fearsome sense of swing. 
</P>
<P>
 You really did come up right in the midst of the whole be-bop sensation of the 
'40s, didn't you? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I got in on the ground floor. I learned so much from that in combination 
with the swing era. There were some great players -- Lester Young, Roy 
Eldridge, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Goodman. I worked with Benny, which was one of 
the highlights of my career. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you sense that, in be-bop, there was a kind of revolution underfoot in 
jazz at the time? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I was in the service, and I grew up with a guy named Tiny Khan. He died 
when he was 29, unfortunately. When I say Tiny -- he weighed close to 400 
pounds. We were all young players. Tiny, Johnny Mandel and I were all kids 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came home on furlough, Tiny said to me, "You've got to hear this new 
music called be-bop." Now, that's like me telling you that there's this new 
music called "bubligheti." The term be-bop sounded that foreign. He took me to 
hear Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, I had given up playing vibes because I had more technique than I 
knew what to do with. I was a classically trained xylophone player. I went back 
to drums. When I heard Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, I didn't know what 
they were doing at all. All I knew was that they were playing 50 billion notes 
-- especially Diz. 
</P>
<P>
 I was home on furlough for 15 days and never went home to see my folks. I 
followed them from 52nd Street until they closed at 4 in the morning, up to 
Minton's until 10 o'clock in the morning -- around the clock. I don't remember 
shaving or taking a shower. I listened to them playing. 
</P>
<P>
 I started playing vibes again. I played 4 million notes. One out of every 
17,000 was right. Rhythmically, I caught onto the be-boppers fast because I was 
a percussion player. Harmonically, they were so far ahead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When I look back now, it's really so logical and simple. One thing follows 
another. Everything Charlie Parker played -- and that Supersax does -- was a 
song. Everything that came off the top of his head was a song. Nobody could 
write a song as good as he played. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you wind up in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 I had a little group from 1953 to '57, which was such a winner that we were on 
the road some 50-odd weeks a year, traveling all over. In those days, you never 
flew. You got in a car. I was actually a driver; I loaded up the thing, and I 
was the leader at the time, also. I worked so hard for four years that we just 
got burnt out. 
</P>
<P>
 I was going to come out and do studio work because I play all the percussion 
instruments. I was going to get into the studios. But I came out here, worked 
for five days and never wanted to see a studio again. 
</P>
<P>
 I've done conducting for Steve Allen for 16 years on television. I enjoy 
writing all the music and putting it all together, but I don't want to sit 
there and suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that you have a natural instinct to be a leader. Is that some kind of 
inherited trait? 
</P>
<P>
 I've been a leader practically all my life. I enjoy putting things together. 
But, believe it or not, I take good directions. I'll listen to anybody in the 
band. My Dream Band albums won every award in the world. It took 16 of us to 
make that. I listen and pick out what I think is the best, and then put it 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Those big band albums from about '59 to '62 are still my favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 But, believe it or not, what I'm going to do Sunday in Ojai I enjoy doing more 
than anything else -- playing with a quartet. I don't do it for anybody but me. 
I don't play for an audience. I hope that they like what I do, but I've got to 
satisfy me first. Details

THEATER REVIEW; FESTIVAL PUTS STUDENT WRITERS AT CENTER STAGE; THE ANNUAL 
VENTURA COLLEGE SHOWCASE IS STRONG ON COMEDY. THE OUTSTANDING ONE-ACT TAKES 
CUES FROM 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE.' 
</P>

<P>
 Of all the year's activities, it's the annual Student One-Act Play Festival 
that gives Ventura College theater students their greatest opportunity to glow 
-- or to fail, miserably. This year's edition, ending this weekend, varies in 
quality, of course. But there's no failure, and a bit of promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Simon, David Mamet and Wendy Wasserstein needn't worry; this quartet of 
sketches shows that their writers (and most of the performers) aim less at the 
Broadway or off-Broadway stage, and more at "Saturday Night Live." The good 
news is that the two purely comic pieces here are, for all their shallowness, 
at least the equal of most of what winds up on "SNL." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither is the most effective or well-wrought piece of the evening. That 
honor goes to "The Circus Harlequin," the show's second-half opener, written 
and directed by Mark Johnson. Like the two comic pieces, it seems inspired by 
television writing: It could have been an episode of "Alfred Hitchcock 
Presents" or perhaps "The Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 A young woman (Carissa J. Martin) joins a traveling circus as a clown after 
her fiance abandons her, "because, he said, I wasn't fun to be around, 
anymore." She is hired by the oily owner (Colin Wilson) who advises her that 
the troupe is a family, and that "nobody leaves the circus." Soon she 
encounters a veteran clown (Nick Justiniano), who doesn't speak, and doesn't 
seem to hear. Eventually she finds out why, and she discovers that the circus 
owner wasn't speaking metaphorically. Brrr . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Billy Alvarado also appears, in a dual role, and the acting throughout is the 
least florid of the evening -- quite an accomplishment, considering that two of 
the main characters here are clowns! 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the show consists of two comic sketches. "A Lovely Day," 
written and directed by Amy Garrett, takes place on a city street where a young 
man (Kenny Luper) spots someone about to jump from a building. As he attempts 
to stop the impending suicide, Luper's character meets wacky stereotypical 
characters: a dotty old woman (Sunny Kristine), a pair of camera-toting 
tourists (Jayne Okruhlik and James C. Minics), and a foot-patrol policeman 
(Vince Ugolini), who for some reason is dressed as a forest ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art Kills," written and directed by P.J. Galligan, takes potshots at 
contemporary art, again with a cast pulled from the Comedy 101 cliche list: a 
snotty gallery owner (Christopher Colone), snobbish patrons (Thomasen Stork, 
Jill Waggoner, Susi Wong), pretentious artists (Kelly Hufford, Jazz Walea) and 
a couple of naive students (Brittany Jones; Becky Stier). 
</P>
<P>
 Galligan chooses his target without showing evidence of knowing anything about 
it. One of the gallery's installations, involving plumbing fixtures, is 
actually pretty interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Garrett, he populates his play with stupid characters, admittedly 
considerably easier to write than smart ones. Containing some real wit, the 
sketch was a crowd-pleaser at last week's opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 The final one-act of the evening, "Etaine and Etaire," may strike some viewers 
as exploring the same superficial and pretentious art as "Art Kills." 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of Siamese twins (Jenypher R. Owens and Sarah P. Meaney) who are joined 
at the back, long to be separated. After their wish is granted in a dream 
sequence, they discover that their relationship is truly symbiotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the play (written by Karen Villeneuve-Hambrick) isn't without merit: 
There's an interesting use of video, it's a clever idea to have the twins sing 
in harmony, and director Susan Compton and actors Owens and Meaney have come up 
with some nice choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays take place on two stages in the college's theater building, so 
there's some moving-around for the audience. There is wheelchair accessibility, 
but entailing more labor than usual. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Student One-Act Play Festival 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m.; Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. Ends 
this Sunday.

THEATER REVIEW; COUNTRY HITS OUT OF STEP IN STORY OF THE OLD WEST; BUT THE 
MELODRAMA TROUPE'S STRONG ACTING HELPS SAVE THE SILLY PLOT OF 'BAD DAY AT 
GOPHER'S BREATH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With no genre safe from its grasp, the Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & 
Vaudeville Company moves to the Old West for its current production, "Bad Day 
at Gopher's Breath." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, as usual, combines a silly plot with song and dance numbers by an 
enthusiastic troupe of young performers. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the story concerns a gang of desperadoes intent on performing one 
last robbery: the bank in Gopher's Breath, Colorado Territory. Inept under even 
the most favorable circumstances, the gang here is hindered by the town's 
corrupt sheriff -- himself after the big payroll -- and by the gang's Rawhide 
Rawlings' having fallen in love with the banker's niece. A bounty hunter is 
after the sheriff, Temperance Union workers are intent on bringing prohibition 
to Gopher's Breath, and everybody tends to break out into song and dance at the 
slightest provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The script, credited to Al and Lee Ver Schure, has been larded with 
more-or-less present-day country hits, among them "Achey Breakey Heart," "Tulsa 
Time" and the Judds' "Girls' Night Out." None of them fits the story, 
particularly, let alone the time period. And the rather flaccid performances 
are likely to create nostalgia for the comparatively energetic original 
versions. This must be one of the very few instances of someone singing with 
less energy than Don Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the acting here is stronger than many of the Melodramas, 
with a cast of beefy guys who play with real punch as well as great costumes. 
Among the wimminfolk , singer-choreographer Erin Appling -- a Melodrama 
stalwart -- is noteworthy, and Carla Jimenez has a voice to be reckoned with, 
even if she, too, was unable to show any drive on top of the feeble rhythms 
supplied throughout last Saturday's matinee performance. Of the men, all of 
whom are fine, David Webster plays hero-by-default Rawlings, Robert Craig is 
the bounty hunter who narrates the story, J.C. Bishop is the sheriff, and Scott 
Cunningham and Andrew Hicks are a couple of the knockabout outlaws. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Bad Day at Gopher's Breath." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Thursdays at 7 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Matinees 
Saturdays and Sundays at 3 through April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Company Theater, 45 E. 
High St., Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Thursday, $6; Fridays, $10; Saturday evenings, $12. Saturday and 
Sunday matinees, $12 adults; $9.50 seniors and children. Group rates are 
available for matinees only. Visa and MasterCard accepted.

THEATER REVIEW; DARK OF THE MOON' GOES A LITTLE HEAVY ON THE HOKUM; THE DRAMA 
IS A MIXTURE OF MYTH AND FOLKLORE PEPPERED WITH THE EROTIC AND SUPERNATURAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 An elaborately staged rustic fantasy with music, "Dark of the Moon," set in 
the Smoky Mountains, is an amalgam of Greek mythology and Southeastern American 
folklore with a touch of "Rosemary's Baby." Despite the story's fairy-tale 
aspects, its sensuality and violence make it unsuitable for youngsters -- if 
only for its climactic rape, set in a revival meeting full of approving 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, concluding its run this weekend at Moorpark College, is based 
loosely on the traditional folk song "Barbara Allen." Howard Richardson and 
William Berney's story tells of John, a witch who falls in love with the mortal 
Barbara Allen. The mystical Conjur Woman grants his request for mortality, 
under the condition that John and Barbara marry and she remain faithful to him 
for a year. John realistically presumes that it's a bad idea to let the 
townspeople know that he's a former witch, but they suspect something's up. 
First, John refuses to set foot on consecrated ground. And then, Barbara gives 
birth . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty of room for hokum here, and very little of that opportunity 
goes unexplored by the playwrights and director Les Wieder -- from the 
mock-countrified dialogue to dressing up John as a piece of '50s urban beefcake 
plopped into the "Hee-Haw" cornfield. There's enough chemical smoke in a couple 
of scenes for a 1975 Deep Purple concert. And to call some of the performances 
"overacting" would be an understatement comparable to calling Roseanne Arnold 
"feisty." 
</P>
<P>
 But "Dark of the Moon" is fantasy, and you buy into it or you don't. If you do 
-- as last week's opening night audience did -- there's a lot of merit to the 
production, starting with Mickey Howell's atmospheric set and Christopher 
Hoag's brilliant music and sound effects, and continuing with Joshua Morrow and 
Tricia Hughes, a handsome couple portraying John and Barbara Allen. Steve 
Connell is effective as the thwarted Marvin Hudgens, bullying until defeated in 
a fight by John Boy's witchery -- and then still bullying but stepping gingerly 
every time he passes the witch. 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Matsuda has arranged some nice choreography, the most effective being a 
show-opening ballet between John and Barbara Allen. Members of the cast sing 
several songs, some traditional, some written for the show. The aforementioned 
rape scene is the most violent in the show, by far, and there are some very 
sensuous moments: When witches played by Mandy Moncibais and Arabee Koch climb 
all over John, it's something to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the large supporting cast, notable comic performances are turned in by 
Colleen Ogilvie as a contentious girl and Greg Crooks as an enthusiastic 
resident of the towns. Details

NIGHT LIFE: MAE MOORE SCORES WITH 'POWER OF LOVE, NOT THE LOVE OF POWER'; 
LYRICS FROM CANADIAN SINGER'S NEW ALBUM ARE THOUGHT-PROVOKING. SHE MAKES HER 
VENTURA COUNTY DEBUT TONIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 She's got a serious album, a serious haircut and a swell sense of humor. The 
album is "Bohemia" by Canadian Mae Moore; the haircut is from the Moe Howard 
Barber School, and the woman will be making her Ventura debut tonight, going 
head-to-head with those Simpsons, which is a prime example of why mom bought 
you that VCR for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bohemia," not the brewski of the same name, is a song about today's 
descendants of those '50s beatniks and '60s trippy hippies. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Moore's best line: "Prejudice is something we can transcend / Coming 
into season the world will flower / With the power of love / Not the love of 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 In another song, she refers to the great 1930 anti-war flick, "All Quiet on 
the Western Front." With references like that, don't expect a Rush Limbaugh 
sticker on her guitar case. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore released an album in Canada a few years ago, but "Bohemia" is her 
American debut. While recording, she received divine guidance -- Steve Kilbey 
of the Church produced. Moore talked things over recently from her Vancouver 
home, moments before leaving to rent a famous movie about World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 So you've got a album on a major label. Are you rich yet? 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet -- I'm still renting. I think that's how you can tell. I don't even 
have a car. 
</P>
<P>
 How is your vision of "Bohemia" different than that of the hippies in the '60s 
or the beatniks in the '50s? 
</P>
<P>
 I was too young to be a hippie, and I've always been on the fringe of 
whatever's happening. I think today it's less laid back; also, the Vietnam War 
was going on then. People now seem to be having actual discussions about things 
instead of just watching television. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone seems to quote your ". . . the power of love not the love of power" 
line. Is Barney right; are things really getting better? 
</P>
<P>
 I dunno if things are changing or not. Personally, I'm an optimistic, hopeful 
person. That's what makes me get up in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are there so many good musicians in Canada, and are there more musicians 
than hockey players? 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing else to do here. There's so much space between everything. I 
guess you could stare at the wheat fields, I dunno. As far as hockey players 
go, I've never thought of that one. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of young people don't even know that Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant are 
dead, and here you are referring to the greatest anti-war film ever made, "All 
Quiet on the Western Front." What was your favorite scene? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm embarrassed to say, I've never seen it, but I will. I'll go out and rent 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of your album is serious -- is music serious business? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not, even though "Bohemia" is partly autobiographical. But I've been 
told that I laugh way too much even though I'm serious about my music. 
</P>
<P>
 So you're not one of those frowning folkies all dressed in black? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, no, not at all. But one time, I opened for Morrissey and I wore black. 
This isn't a folkie thing. We're a power trio and very loud. I have a bass 
player that plays upright bass and a guitar player who has been called "The 
Digital Blizzard." 
</P>
<P>
 What's the process for selecting a single from an album? 
</P>
<P>
 My management and I lobbied hard for "Bohemia." It's the cornerstone of the 
record. It sets up an atmosphere and establishes a sense of place instead of 
one of the more poppy songs. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the writing process like for you? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm driven. It's never a chore. It's like eating chocolate. I'm very 
stimulated by visual things, and I absorb things like a sponge. 
</P>
<P>
 What's it like being the opening act? 
</P>
<P>
 It depends on who you're opening for. It's very difficult without a sound 
check because you only have 30 minutes to get your point across. Being 
comfortable with your sound is so important. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think Mae Moore music is like? 
</P>
<P>
 It's lyric-oriented, acoustically driven. It's searching music, a cheap way to 
travel, and music to make love by. Oh hey, I just got a fax. My record was 
reviewed in Outlaw Biker magazine. At least I wasn't the centerfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Not enough tattoos? 
</P>
<P>
 I have plenty of tattoos -- emotional tattoos on my heart that I'd never show 
to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 When did you decide to become a musician? 
</P>
<P>
 I was lying on my bed listening to the radio, and this David Crosby song came 
on that just blew me away. I started playing the guitar when I was 14 or 15 
years old. My mom died when I was 16, and I sort of turned to the guitar to get 
away from depression. I've always been sort of a shy person, so I started to 
write to work things out in my mind. But if it would be possible to make a wish 
and have it come true, it would be to hear yourself on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 All musicians want to know this one. How does a band get signed? 
</P>
<P>
 I think you have to have something different. You have to have songs. Anyone 
can come up with a halfway decent sound with synthesizers and computers, but 
you need that intangible something. I was friends with some people in bands, 
and one of them got one of my demos to the president of Sony Canada and he came 
to see me play. It was a good night; the place was packed and he offered me a 
deal. I wasn't really stressed or anything -- if it happens, it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you do for fun? 
</P>
<P>
 I took up surfing because Vancouver Island has waves, plus we don't have a 
shark problem; they're little lemon sharks. I paint; I went to art school, and 
I'm hoping to do an art show soon. I read a lot. I watch movies. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next?

 We're going to tour with the Dummies for three weeks at least, maybe a few 
more, then go to Australia, Tokyo and London. Details

WORDS & IMAGES: QUAKE MADE MATTERS WORSE AT OUR LIBRARIES; HARD-HIT BY BUDGET 
CUTS, MANY FACILITIES FACE EVEN MORE SEVERE FUNDING SHORTAGES NOW. IT'S TIME 
FOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT.

 If you are an active member of any Friends of the Library group, you are aware 
of the crisis in funding. If you don't know about it, a small lecture -- with a 
self-serving element -- is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 For struggling libraries heavily damaged by the Jan. 17 earthquake, as was the 
Thousand Oaks facility, the funding crisis has become catastrophic. But even 
before the earth shook, the Camarillo Library had to cut services: staff down 
by 50%; library hours drastically reduced; telephone reference and information 
assistance gone; the community room no longer available to local groups because 
of diminished staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Why aren't we outraged? If education is not a priority and we rear generations 
of illiterate people indifferent to the printed word, then magazines, 
newspapers and books will become museum artifacts. No newspapers, no 
columnists, no work for writers. No work for me.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: TWO-STEP TURNED INTO WEDDING MARCH; A PROFESSOR AND HIS 
SWEETHEART STARTED STUDYING DANCING FROM SCRATCH AND WENT ON TO BECOME THE BEST 
IN THE WEST.

 If you think Joe Diffie's hit song, "John Deere Green" about Billy Bob and 
Charlene tells a great love story, keep reading. But be warned: It might lead 
you to Ventura Western Days, a three-day dance workshop weekend March 11 
through 13 in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, Bob Gray, then a 52-year-old geology professor at Santa 
Barbara City College, had never danced a step in his life. But the Mucker's 
Ball, his department's annual fund-raising event, was ominously near. So Bob, 
who was recently divorced, signed up for a six-week basic country-Western dance 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Cinderfella made it to the ball. But he was so frustrated trying to 
coordinate his footwork and turns that Professor Bob dropped out of dance 
class. And he took it four more times before giving himself a passing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did meet a sweetheart. And in November, 1991, Marcia Spranger, a 
marketing consultant with an MBA, put on her cream-colored waltz competition 
dress. Bob, the Ph.D., wore a Western suit. They were married among friends on 
the dance floor at the SouthWestern Regional Grand Championships, in 
Burlingame, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met through dancing. And it was and is still a big piece of our lives. So 
it seemed right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they met in 1988, Marcia was engaged to someone else and was fighting 
breast cancer. "I was working hard to do positive, fun things. Dancing was 
really good therapy for me. I had fun and forgot everything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob was in the class because "he didn't want to look like a complete idiot," 
said Marcia, who turns 52 this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then Bob took me to see my very first competition event. I remember telling 
him, 'I would really love to do this.' And he said, 'I can't do this!' But he 
did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Marcia have competed nationally for four years in the Silver Division 
(minimum age 45, joint age 100+), and they have a roomful of trophies to show 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, they were recognized as Best in the West and named Overall Champions 
of the SouthWestern Regional Grand Championships by placing first in all seven 
of their dances. It was the first time this had ever been done by a competing 
couple. Last year, they became Silver World Champions in East Coast Swing and 
Pony Swing at the First World Championship of Country Western Dance, held in 
Nashville. And about six weeks ago they took second place overall at the same 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 To help defray the cost of competing, Bob and Marcia began teaching four years 
ago for the Santa Barbara Recreation Department and for the Goleta Valley 
Community Center. They also give private lessons in their home studio. 
</P>
<P>
 And Marcia is the editor and publisher of a bimonthly country-Western dance 
magazine, Western Express, which began as a newsletter for the Grays' dance 
classes in Santa Barbara, and grew into a national magazine with a circulation 
of 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 And on March 12, local dance enthusiasts can take advantage of the couple's 
experience during their workshop and demo for Ventura Western Days. There, Bob 
will draw on personal experience to help beleaguered weekend social dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell our story to the guys and they say it makes them hang in there," said 
Bob. "It's very difficult for the man. Most are there to please their 
significant other. And it takes an enormous amount of time to learn how to turn 
the lady at the right time, maintain the flow of the music patterns and keep 
footwork going as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man initiates the move and has got to do it on the right count. So it's 
like learning how to drive a car: clutch, take your foot off the gas, brake and 
shift all at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 So take it from Bob, who's been there. "Men's egos are fragile and dancing 
doesn't always come easy. If you want to be a good two-stepper -- as in 
athletics -- you've got to have persistence and practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man doesn't want to look foolish on the floor. But unless he's got enough 
gumption to learn, he will throw the lady all over the dance floor." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Bob and Marcia Gray will teach intermediate two-step and perform a 
dance demonstration during Ventura Western Days, an annual three-day weekend of 
country dancing, workshops and competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: California Ballroom-American Legion Hall, 83 S. Palm St., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Dance workshop, 12:30 p.m. and demo at 9:15 p.m. Saturday, March 12 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Three-day admission pass per person until March 5, $35, $15 for age 17 
and under one-day tickets, $10. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: 647-1893 for details on Ventura Western Days; 682-8437 for information

JAUNTS; WHEELCHAIR TENNIS COMPETITORS PROVE THEY KNOW ALL THE MOVES; PLAYERS -- 
SOME OF THEM NATIONALLY RANKED -- WILL SHOW THEIR AGILITY IN DOUBLES TOURNEY AT 
PIERPONT RACQUET CLUB.

 Tim Ambler probably wouldn't be playing tennis these days if he hadn't broken 
his back in a climbing accident and landed in a wheelchair, partially 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 If that makes little sense, come see Ambler in action this weekend in the Hot 
Wheels Tennis Tournament in Ventura. It's a mind-boggling competition featuring 
athletes who play tennis from wheelchairs. And Ambler, ranked seventh in the 
United States, is among the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Put on by the city of Ventura and the Rehabilitation Institute in Santa 
Barbara, the tournament runs Saturday and Sunday at the Pierpont Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators will see a round-robin doubles playoff with teams composed of a 
wheelchair player randomly paired with an able-bodied player. The rules are 
nearly the same as regular tennis, except that the wheelchair players get two 
bounces if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Players can also enter another division of competition designed to show just 
how tough it is to swing a racket from a wheelchair. In this one, an able 
player gets in a wheelchair and pairs up with a real wheelchair player to 
square off against a similarly matched duo. The result is a little like bumper 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's enlightening how much it takes to do it," said Renee Gomez, the 
tournament organizer and a therapeutic coordinator for Ventura. She expects the 
tournament to draw 40 to 50 competitors including wheelchair and non-wheelchair 
players. Some of them are hotshot players, like Ambler, who play the tennis 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, after the tournament, Ambler will play an exhibition doubles match 
with fellow hotshot wheelchair athlete Tito Bautista of Santa Barbara and two 
able-bodied players. 
</P>
<P>
 To watch the 27-year-old Ventura man play isn't so much an opportunity to see 
good tennis as it is to see amazing wheelchair moves. After all, he must muscle 
the chair into place before he even takes a swing at the ball. It's tennis made 
infinitely harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambler, who grew up in Louisiana, wasn't a tennis player before his 1990 
accident. He had gone to college on a golf scholarship, and later ended up in 
the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 He was rock climbing for fun on a weekend away from Marine duty when he fell 
40 feet, breaking his back and his left arm. But after only a few months in a 
wheelchair, he took up tennis and quickly honed his skills. Now he wears a leg 
brace and is able to walk short distances, but he can't run. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking up tennis was difficult, he said, because he had to incorporate the 
wheelchair into an already challenging sport. Position and timing were crucial. 
He uses a 25-pound ultra-light chair, made by Camarillo-based Kuschall of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he played 12 tournaments all over the country last year, his key 
interest right now is graduating from UC Santa Barbara this spring with a 
biology degree. Then he wants to go for a graduate degree and eventually teach 
science and coach sports. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Hot Wheels Tennis Tournament, a competition featuring wheelchair 
tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday and Sunday; play begins at noon both days. On Sunday, 
able-bodied players take to wheelchairs in play beginning at 2 p.m. Exhibition 
match at 5 p.m. Sunday, with a reception to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Pierpont Racquet Club, 500 Sanjon Road, Ventura. (Take Sanjon exit 
off Ventura Freeway.) 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: The deadline for registering to play in the tournament has passed. For 
information, call 658-4739.

KIDS ON FILM; DURANTE AND AN EVER-THICKENING PLOT STEAL THE SHOW; IN "GREEDY," 
A GROUP OF BACK-STABBING RELATIVES, PANICKED THAT THEIR MANIPULATIVE OLD UNCLE 
JOE (KIRK DOUGLAS) IS ABOUT TO WILL HIS MILLIONS TO A SHAPELY LIVE-IN "NURSE," 
SEEKS HELP FROM HIS LONG-LOST FAVORITE, DANNY (MICHAEL J. FOX), WHO THEN GETS 
SUCKED INTO THE FAMILY RIVALRY. (RATED PG-13)

<P>
 Being a sneak preview, hardly anyone knew what to expect, except that they 
were about to see a movie with Kirk Douglas and Michael J. Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, it was the ever-twisting and thickening plot that stole the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Uncle Joe playing mind games to see who really loved him? Was he really 
rich or was he really in debt? Was Danny trying to deceive him? 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have named it 'Deception,' " 11-year-old Matt Khalil said. "I 
loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some adults found the movie dragged some and the ending predictable. But even 
older kids said they were hugely surprised by the final plot twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good movie, better than I expected," said Heather Cohn, 19. 
"Normally, I fall asleep in movies, and I didn't fall asleep in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Cannon, 22: "I thought it was great. It was very hilarious. The 
whole plot was just excellent. Great twists. Very funny. The ending was just 
spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon, a fan of "Saturday Night Live," especially liked the performance of 
SNL regular Phil Hartman as one of the sleazier cousins who has no problem with 
trading all respect and dignity for his chance at a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the audience cheered when Hartman -- his perfect image shattered at a 
family dinner by his defiant teen-ager's "Make me!" retort -- actually picks up 
the boy and whisks him away to the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do the relatives cover up their own imperfections to gain Uncle Joe's 
favor, they also hire private detectives to spy on one another to discredit 
their rivals for the inheritance. They undergo sex-selection fertilization to 
ensure that they will produce male heirs. Those who don't name their girls with 
variations of Joe. They bring him $400 stuffed birds for his collection because 
"you have to spend money to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 To show up his relatives, Danny even performs his boyhood Jimmy Durante 
imitation that Uncle Joe used to love. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Kawaguchi, 9, was impressed with a black-and-white clip of a Durante 
performance that introduces the movie. He didn't know who Durante was before 
the movie and he didn't know afterward. But, still, he was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who are concerned about language (and even those who usually are not) 
should be warned that a number of the laughs rely on colorful insults and 
swearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are concerned about sex or nudity should know that many of the other 
laughs rely on whether or not "nurse" Molly will sleep with the frail, elderly 
Uncle Joe. We are also treated to the tattooed buns of Michael J. Fox, which 
some of us could live without. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Kenneth said he couldn't rank it with his all-time favorites. 
Given the choice, he said he'd probably put it in the other category of those 
"I might forget about tomorrow."

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; FESTIVAL LINES UP 15 WORKS BY CHICANOS; SHOWN 
OVER FIVE DAYS AT OXNARD COLLEGE, MOVIES INCLUDE 'THE ART OF LOWRIDING.'

<P>
 A festival featuring Chicano films kicks off Friday at Oxnard College in what 
organizers hope will become an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first attempt isn't a small one -- 15 films over five days -- everything 
from the murals of Diego Rivera to documentaries on the United Farm Workers to 
surveys of Aztec ruins. There's even a movie titled "Low and Slow: The Art of 
Lowriding." 
</P>
<P>
 James Vega, a vocational counselor at the college and festival organizer, 
defended the decision to mix a movie about a pop subculture together with more 
serious subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think lowriding is a form of showing pride and we need young people to get 
involved in activities that show positive results like lowriding." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival opens Friday with a locally produced docudrama about working 
conditions at a Somis flower ranch. "Slave Case: USA" is a 10-minute 
work-in-progress about the mistreatment of hundreds of Latinos that led to 
slavery charges against ranch owner Edwin M. Ives in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film contains re-enactments of the process by which the workers were 
smuggled here and the conditions they worked in, surrounded by barbed wire and 
subjected to psychological abuse," said Vega, who is a co-producer of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavery charges were dropped as part of a plea bargain in which Ives pleaded 
guilty to corporate racketeering. He agreed to pay $1.5 million in back wages 
to 300 former workers, the stiffest fine ever levied in a U.S. immigration 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a tremendous response when we debuted the film at Ventura College on 
Nov. 4," Vega said. "We're expecting a big crowd Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 "Slave Case" screens at 6 p.m. in building LA-6. The rest of the festival 
continues Monday through Thursday. For more information call 646-2875. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 If 15 Spanish language or Chicano films aren't enough, you can visit the Santa 
Barbara International Film Festival, also starting Friday and running through 
March 13. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday the festival features "El Lado Oscuro del Corazon," an Argentine 
film. On the following Friday, the Santa Barbara festival is featuring 
"Cronos," a Mexican vampire movie, and on Saturday the world premiere of 
"...and the earth did not swallow him," a film based on the life of Chicano 
writer Tomas Rivera.

FASHION; FUR WEARERS ARE FEW, FAR BETWEEN IN VENTURA COUNTY; SHIFT IN PUBLIC 
SENTIMENT HAS MADE WHAT WAS ONCE THE ULTIMATE HIGH-FASHION STATEMENT NEARLY A 
RARITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This is a story about an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Once common in these parts, the fur wearer appears to be dying out, or 
possibly migrating to the East Coast, where they are known to be indigenous. 
</P>
<P>
 We tracked them carefully this season; but sightings were rare. Fur coat 
owners in Ventura County seem shy and hard to flush out. We decided they had 
moved on to better territory -- unless, of course, they are hibernating. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that we didn't explore likely habitats. We checked out what were once 
prime mink venues, keeping a low profile, ready to spring should one stroll 
within interviewing distance. But, there was little action. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, on probably the coldest evening of winter, we were at a sizable 
church in Newbury Park. There may have been 300 congregants attending Mass, all 
wearing sweaters, sweat shirts, gabardines, parkas or Windbreakers. No fur. Not 
so much as a tail on a collar. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a blustery afternoon, we were at a gallery opening at Carnegie Museum 
in Oxnard. Same thing; not a fur in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 We spoke with a thirtysomething professional woman in Ventura, who asked that 
her name not appear in this space. She admitted to having brought a mink jacket 
with her upon relocating from the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't wear fur here -- no way. It's too scary," she said, "People might 
hate me." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arrival, her mink was denned, so to speak. She sold it this winter to a 
man from somewhere else who promptly hustled it across the state line to 
present to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 It got us to thinking. We figured if there was fur out there, it might gather 
at Leisure Village in Camarillo, where traditions count. We spoke to Shirley 
Kordell, president of Brandeis University National Women's Committee, Ventura 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of furs among the residents, she said, but she hasn't seen one 
in a long while. They are all kept in closets, not worn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of the public sentiment; and I agree with the sentiment," she 
said, "They shouldn't be killing those animals for their furs." 
</P>
<P>
 Daunted, we checked with Sandy Bardos of Port Hueneme, for many years a 
fashion consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of anyone who has one," she said. "The people who are hip are 
not doing it. Fur is ostentatious; it makes a statement -- people have stopped 
wanting to make that statement. It's the same thing as ivory. It makes us think 
of a healthier planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Still on the trail, we reconnoitered at a Brahms-Dvorak gig at the Ventura 
Symphony -- the perfect lure. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay dirt! Fur wearers broke cover as curtain time neared, traveling mostly in 
pairs, or accompanied by cloth-covered male escorts. We counted four jackets, 
two stoles and one bold, blond coat. The wearers were stately, silver-haired 
types, easily overtaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them spoke with us, anonymously. They had bought their minks many years 
ago, out of state, they said. One explained it was her first public venture in 
the coat in a while; it is usually reserved for private parties. The other 
woman said she was new in town -- and clearly thought California reporters were 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 These sorties left us wondering: Who buys the coats at the one remaining fur 
salon in the county -- Bullock's of Thousand Oaks? 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the store, without being asked, said that fur is a "renewable 
product that doesn't pollute or cause any environmental damage -- such as fake 
furs do," adding that 90% of Bullock's furs are ranched, not trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how sales are going, he assured us that the salon is still successful. 
Sales figures are not yet in for 1993, but he thinks they are up. Like fur 
sales nationally, they dropped for three years, then increased 10% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to compare the Thousand Oaks store's receipts with other Bullock's 
salons, saying this is one of their smaller outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular furs in the store are mink and fox, he told us, and most 
purchases are of casual, reversible jackets, which have lambskin on the 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute -- it was starting to come together. Here was the explanation we 
were looking for. Fur fanciers have found a way to indulge while being socially 
correct. They are buying furs, and wearing them inside out! 
</P>
<P>
 That's it, we decided. Throughout the county, they go about their routines in 
ho-hum leather; then, when they travel to the frozen north, or wherever, 
they're ready to flaunt mink. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cinch. One heads out to Oxnard Airport wrapped in lambskin, climbs 
aboard a plane, and waves farewell to one's unsuspecting friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Once alone, it's the old Clark Kent maneuver. The traveler heads to the 
restroom, and, voila! Moments later, out comes sleek mink, its rich folds 
rippling with each stride up the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she runs the risk of confrontation by her seatmate -- unless that 
person, too, has a costume change under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Privacy in winter garments is only to be expected. It's a sign of 
the '90s -- furtive fur.

SHOP TALK; COMPARING DISCOUNT PRICES CAN MAKE CENTS; PENNY PINCHERS AND COUPON 
CLIPPERS, BE ADVISED. THE CHAIN STORES' NAMES ARE IDENTICAL, BUT THE TAGS ON 
ITEMS ARE NOT.

 Maybe you don't clip candy coupons. Maybe you don't wait for your favorite 
brand of aspirin to go on sale before buying it. Maybe you don't save bars of 
soap until there's no more than a fingernail's worth left -- and then pronounce 
it dead only after it slides from your hands and slithers down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people take major steps to scrimp and save on everyday household items. 
Maybe you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 But we'd be willing to bet you also don't go out of your way to find the 
highest prices on items either. We'd be willing to bet that all things being 
equal -- like convenience of location -- you would shop where the items you 
want the most cost the least. Maybe you'd even go so far as to do the vast 
majority of your shopping at discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week we visited some local outlets of well-known discount chains to see 
how discounted these discount items are. We took five frequently purchased 
items -- candy, shampoo, soap, juice and pain relief medicine -- and did a 
little price comparison (tax not included). 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with juice. If you've got kids, no doubt you've got juice. We 
chose cranberry juice cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
 First we stopped at the Walmart in the Shopping at the Rose shopping center in 
Oxnard. A 64-ounce plastic container of Ocean Spray cranberry juice was going 
for $2.32. The same size container of Sam's Choice (the house brand) was priced 
at $1.97. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oxnard Target store, the price was $2.34 for the Ocean Spray and $1.99 
for Greatland (the house special). The price of that same Ocean Spray in the 
Ventura Target was $2.44, and at the Simi Valley Target it was $2.99. Greatland 
was going for $1.99 in Simi Valley, but $2.07 in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Valley K mart, Ocean Spray was $2.67 and Nature's Classic (the 
house brand) was $1.97. At K mart in Ventura, the prices were $2.54 (Ocean 
Spray) and $1.97 (Nature's Classic). At the Thrifty store in Ventura's 
Buenaventura Mall, a 48-ounce glass jar of Ocean Spray was $2.19. And at the 
Price Club in Oxnard, where things are sold in bulk, Ocean Spray was going for 
$4.89 per gallon (and 64 ounces is half a gallon). 
</P>
<P>
 Had enough to drink? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's move on to candy -- our personal favorite, and darn it if we didn't feel 
obligated to do a taste test, just to be thorough. We decided to focus on a 
one-pound bag of peanut M&Ms. 
</P>
<P>
 At Walmart, the bag was priced at $2.17; at Target in Oxnard, $1.99 (it was a 
dime cheaper at the Ventura Target), and at the Ventura K mart, it was selling 
for $1.99. At the Price Club, a three-pound bag of peanut M&Ms was $5.09. 
(Don't think we weren't tempted.) 
</P>
<P>
 After handling all that chocolate, we figured we'd better wash our hands. We 
priced a few common brands of soap bars. 
</P>
<P>
 A twin-pack of Dove cost $1.55 at Walmart, $2.11 at the Ventura K mart, and 
$2.39 at the Buenaventura Mall Thrifty. At the Price Club, an eight-pack was 
$7.29. As for Target in Oxnard, one bar is regularly priced at $1.09, but was 
on sale: six bars for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-pack of Zest was $1.92 at both the Oxnard and Ventura Targets, $2.07 
at the Ventura K mart, and $2.29 at the Ventura Thrifty. A dozen Zest bars were 
$5.99 at the Price Club. 
</P>
<P>
 While we were in the health and beauty section, we picked out a couple of 
shampoos. Suave (12 ounces) was 97 cents at Walmart, 99 cents at the Target 
stores, $1.68 at K mart, and $1.59 at Thrifty. Revlon Flex (15 ounces) was 
$1.58 at K mart, $1.59 at the Targets, $1.23 at Walmart, and was on sale at 
Thrifty for $2.09 (regularly priced at $2.69). 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, we took a look at the medicine aisle -- all these numbers kind of 
gave us a headache. A package of 50 generic ibuprofen tablets was $2.66 at K 
mart, $1.96 at Walmart, $1.96 at the Oxnard Target, and $2.35 at the Ventura 
Target. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't hurt to compare prices, not only between chains, but between stores 
in the same chain. And if you happen to find a sale along the way, 
congratulations.

THEATER REVIEWS; PLAY WITHIN A PLAY SETS STAGE FOR REDEMPTION; AUSTRALIAN 
PRISON INMATES IN 'OUR COUNTRY'S GOOD' DISCOVER UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES 
THROUGH THEIR ROLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of us, the theater is rarely more than a diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the real-life circumstances depicted in Timberlake Wertenbaker's "Our 
Country's Good," the very act of putting on the first play ever performed in 
Australia proved to be a major turning point, not only for the participants but 
for the social evolution of a continent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1789, the inhabitants of the Australian penal colonies were the cast-off 
dregs of British society: transported convicts serving out their days in 
isolated squalor under the brutal regime of their naval officer jailers. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the colony's newly arrived governor and a well-intentioned lieutenant 
enlisted some of the most hard-bitten convicts to perform in a makeshift 
staging of one of the few scripts in their possession, it was a social 
experiment without precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the colony's hellish conditions, so vividly evoked in Ensemble Theatre 
Company's impeccable production, we witness nothing less than the redemption of 
lost souls through the process of creating art. 
</P>
<P>
 That the convicts' play itself is an inconsequential farce makes no 
difference. The real value of their participation lies in the undreamed of 
human possibilities they discover through their roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've seen rich ladies before, haven't you?" their director, Lt. Ralph Clark 
(Ivan Pelly), queries as he tries to get them to assume the postures 
appropriate to their characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I've robbed a few," replies Liz Morden (Emma-Jane Huerta), a convict 
under sentence of hanging. As rehearsals progress, Morden's moral sensibilities 
evolve with stunning force. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side of the process, Pelly's Clark descends from an initially 
superior stance as he's drawn into a desperate affair with another convict 
(Alison Coutts). 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Vore plays the bullying officer violently opposed to the play. 
"We'll be holding balls for them next," he sneers with great distinction. His 
abusive treatment of the convicts makes for some of the evening's most 
harrowing moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertenbaker's extraordinary celebration of transcendent human capability uses 
adult language and situations in the service of its hard-hitting realism, so 
mature viewing is advised. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 11-member cast donning multiple roles in rapid-fire succession, the 
play's challenging production logistics have been handled as smoothly as the 
delivery of its powerful message by director Robert G. Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 The few rough spots are usually matters of pacing: A little more breathing 
room is needed for the emotional shifts that accompany Clark's love scene and 
for the surreal commentaries by a native aborigine (Mark Lee). And one 
pathetically self-deprecating, fever-racked character (Bink Goncharoff) expires 
with such an exaggerated flourish -- arm flopping in an enormous arc just as 
his girlfriend pleads with him not to die -- that the effect is laughable 
rather than tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, maybe we're just not that sorry to see him go. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Our Country's Good," Alhecama Theatre, 914 Santa Barbara St., Santa 
Barbara, through March 20, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sunday 
matinees at 2 p.m. Cost: $14 to $19. For reservations or information, call 
962-8606. SOUTH PACIFIC 
</P>
<P>
 In the masterfully unreal universe of Rodgers and Hammerstein, "South 
Pacific," now in its 50th anniversary year, endures as one of the team's most 
exotic retreats. If you're looking for escape, why not head for a tropical 
island paradise where the inhabitants spontaneously give voice to their 
feelings in perfectly rhymed song, and where full-bodied orchestras lie in wait 
behind every palm frond? 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you're not tempted by the seductive airs of "Bali H'ai" and "Some 
Enchanted Evening," PCPA Theaterfest's revival offers other notable 
enticements. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list are two strong actors -- Jonathan Gillard Daly and Kerry Neel 
-- who breathe new life into the familiar romantic leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly elevates the character of Emile de Becque, the reclusive plantation 
owner, to an embittered figure of near-"Casablanca" stature after his true love 
Nellie (Neel) bails on their engagement when she learns about his first 
marriage to a now-deceased Polynesian. His subsequent rendition of "This Nearly 
Was Mine" reopens the wounds of failed love affairs the world over. 
</P>
<P>
 After establishing an engaging self-confidence in her early numbers, Neel's 
wholesome, girl-next-door Nellie is convincingly torn apart by the racial bias 
she discovers within herself, something she can't even explain. 
</P>
<P>
 The parallel story line about doomed interracial love between a naive young 
lieutenant (Tim Fullerton) and a beautiful island girl (Alysa Sylvia Lobo) 
founders somewhat on the shoals of the former's self-absorbed delivery, but it 
proves the only weak link in an otherwise impressive cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's broadside attack on the deep-rooted prejudice beneath the surface 
of the American ideal is one of its most surprising elements. For that, we have 
to thank the musical's unusually literate source material -- James A. 
Michener's "Tales of the South Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, director Brad Carroll gives full weight to the hard-hitting 
social commentary. Yet his impeccable staging never loses sight of the primary 
mission of "South Pacific": a romantic fantasy of the most unabashedly 
sentimental kind. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a production guaranteed to make you long for love, danger or a more 
adventurous choice in plays, as the case may be. 
</P>
<P>
 * "South Pacific," Allan Hancock College Marian Theater, Santa Maria, through 
March 13, Thursdays through Sundays at 8, matinees Wednesdays, Saturdays and 
Sundays at 2, $11-$17, (800) 549-PCPA. THE GOOD PERSON OF SZECHWAN 
</P>
<P>
 The name Bertolt Brecht isn't one we normally associate with zany mirth. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the cranky old Marxist himself eventually relented from all that 
austere, social moralizing and conceded that entertainment had some place in 
the theater after all. In his later works, he incorporated many forms of 
popular entertainment, from street theater to vaudeville to cabaret-style 
song-and-dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to do justice to the spirit -- rather than the dogma -- of Brecht, 
director Peter Lackner has brought a spirit of whimsy and optimism about the 
human condition to his staging of "The Good Person of Szechwan" for the UC 
Santa Barbara department of dramatic arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad slapstick, surreal sound and visual effects, and a fair amount of 
improvising enliven this ironic modern parable about a social order which 
rewards evil and punishes good. 
</P>
<P>
 When three gods visit the mortal world in search of a "good person," the best 
they can come up with is a prostitute, Shen Teh, who gives them shelter. They 
reward her with money, which she uses to start a "legitimate" business (a 
tobacco store), but she's quickly exploited and driven into bankruptcy by the 
unscrupulous people of Szechwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when Shen Teh disguises herself as a man and begins practicing shady 
business dealings (including selling opium) does she regain her former wealth 
and status. 
</P>
<P>
 As Shen Teh and her male alter ego Shui Ta, young Rina Mimoun handles the 
shifts in her character with promising dexterity. For the most part, however, 
the appeal is not in the student performers themselves but in the extravagant 
staging in which Lackner employs them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brecht completed a more-familiar earlier script called "The Good 
Woman of Szechwan," for this freewheeling adaptation Lackner chose the 
seldom-performed, more tightly focused "Santa Monica" version the author 
revised during his World War II exile in the United States. The later version 
was also the script that fractured his partnership with Kurt Weill, a 
historical interest item sure to perk up the umlauts of Brechtian scholars 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Good Person of Szechwan," Hatlen Theatre, UC Santa Barbara, Thursday 
through Saturday at 8, $10, (805) 893-3535. JOAN OF ARC 
</P>
<P>
 Two paragraphs were omitted from the recent review of "Joan of Arc" at Santa 
Barbara's Trinity Episcopal Church. As the missing section contained the only 
reference to the play's librettist and producer, they're included here for 
balance and completeness: 
</P>
<P>
 "Little remains of the original libretto by Susan Stewart Potter (no relation 
to composer David) which, like the grain of sand that provokes an oyster to 
secrete its pearl, brought forth the satisfying score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally serviceable, the much-revised lyrics are still occasionally 
strained (an ambitious cleric smirking 'Besides if she's a heretic/Then I 
assure my bishopric,' and so on)." 
</P>
<P>
 The review went on to note that the performances commendably overcame the 
pedestrian lyrics.

MUSIC; TOMBO COMBO ADDS SOME HIGH VOLTAGE TO ITS ROOTSY BLUES; THE BAND HAS A 
'RURAL DELTA' STYLE THAT INCLUDES PLAYING STEPHEN FOSTER TUNES ON TENOR BANJO 
AND SLIDE GUITAR.

 Santa Barbara's Tombo Combo doubled in size during the last year. Instead of 
two guys playing acoustic roots music, now it's four guys doing that stuff, 
only louder, and using a lot of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always been an electric musician," said slide guitar player Tom Murray 
during a recent interview. "Every blues place is a dance place, and they don't 
really want to hear acoustic music. And why should we limit ourselves? If 
you're good, you can back it up. We're a very hard act to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Tombo Combo will be returning to Toes Tavern on State Street for a free 
Wednesday night performance. For more than three years, it was just Spider 
Murphy on banjo and Murray on slide guitar and Leon Redbone-like vocals. The 
band now includes Jack Tyson-Joshua on bass and Rod Rolle on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing in Joseppi's, and the two guys that manage Toes came in," 
Murray said. "They ended up dancing around with chairs on their heads, so we 
blackmailed them into giving us a gig there a few weeks ago. We like that 
place, but we also want to play SOhO and Nicolby's in Ventura. Everyone in the 
band has been around, so I'm not going to book any gigs that are going to make 
anyone want to leave the band." 
</P>
<P>
 The band has a bunch of originals, written by Murphy and Murray. While most 
bands play covers of this week's happening popular artist, Tombo Combo plays 
covers that are so old, nobody cares or remembers who wrote them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got around 25 originals," said Tyson-Joshua. "We also do a lot of 
traditional songs that are really old. I mean we do 'Camptown Races' but no one 
today even knows who Stephen Foster was." 
</P>
<P>
 A rootsy band with a tenor banjo and slide guitar somehow seems incongruent 
with the lower State Street scene in Santa Barbara where kids just want to 
dance to Spencer the Gardener, Munkafust and Common Sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play a little bit of blues, bluegrass, country and zydeco," Rolle said. 
"We call it jumpin' juke joint music." 
</P>
<P>
 "People try to put us in a category, but they don't know what to call us," 
Murphy said. "We have a rural Delta sound, like something you'd hear from 
somebody's porch on the bayou. We steal from all the various juke joint 
styles." 
</P>
<P>
 And every town seems to have a blues scene that won't get big, but also won't 
go away. Blues Night is traditionally any night a club owner can make anything 
instead of nothing, which usually means Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Santa Barbara blues are silly," Tyson-Joshua said. "People hear the 
blues fifth hand and don't understand the tradition, the history. After a 
couple of Stevie Ray Vaughan records, people think they know what the blues are 
about, when very few musicians even have a clue. Also, most of these people 
wouldn't even go to a real blues joint." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right -- a lot of people just try to copy the blues," Murray said. 
"They don't try to make up their own sound. That's exactly what we're not 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 And they spend their days as well as their nights trying to teach people what 
the blues are about; Murray, Murphy and Tyson-Joshua are music teachers. "I've 
had most of my students for two or three years," said Murphy, co-owner of 
Murray and Murphy's Guitar Man Studio. "We've been doing this long enough so 
that we don't take students just because their parents have money and want to 
get rid of the kid for an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Murphy and Murray are grooming the next generation of local S.B. 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you can play scales, the next step is to realize that you can make your 
own music," said Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Tombo Combo has a tape entitled "Big Time," but it came out last year before 
they electrified. They're hoping for a CD by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Tombo Combo's Ventura debut will be March 18 at Nicolby's. Details

COVER STORY: CULTURAL EVOLUTION; IT'S A NEW ERA AT THE VENTURA COUNTY MUSEUM OF 
HISTORY AND ART. YOU WON'T FIND THE TWO-HEADED LAMB ANYMORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This frequently asked question at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art 
has nothing to do with either history or art: Whatever happened to the 
two-headed lamb? 
</P>
<P>
 "We get people in all the time who remember that thing from when they were 
children and ask where it is," said Yetive Hendricks, an 82-year-old Ventura 
resident and longtime museum docent. 
</P>
<P>
 For four decades at the museum, the anatomically incorrect critter was a 
favorite attraction "that everybody liked to touch," recalled Delee Marshall, a 
docent since 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, the stuffed lamb collects dust, not pats on the heads. 
The creature can be found grazing atop a storage cabinet in the museum's 
off-limits basement, sharing cramped quarters with collections of marbles, 
Kewpie dolls and other sideshow oddities. 
</P>
<P>
 A symbol of the museum's quirky parochialism -- and casual disregard for high 
professional standards -- the lamb was put out to pasture in 1977. That was 
when the museum moved into its present headquarters across from San 
Buenaventura Mission and "finally entered the 20th Century," said Richard 
Esparza, former executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still not considered in the same league as Santa Barbara's Museum of 
Natural History and Museum of Art, Ventura's 80-year-old institution continues 
to evolve into a higher cultural entity in the post-two-headed lamb era. Not 
only is it closing in on accreditation by the prestigious American Assn. of 
Museums -- only 739 museums in the country have met the strict requirements -- 
but the county facility is already drawing a bead on the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the museum was awarded a hard-to-get $50,979 grant by the National 
Endowment for the Humanities to plan the redesign of its history exhibits. 
Executive Director Ed Robings calls the award "one of the most exciting things 
to happen around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings and newly hired Curator Tim Schiffer expect to take the museum into 
the world of interactive high-tech and give the exhibits a more contemporary 
interpretive spin. 
</P>
<P>
 And while publicly financed museums such as the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art are experiencing rough financial times, the county museum -- which became a 
private, nonprofit corporation in 1978 -- is on stable footing and is even 
considering expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had to cut back our hours and do the drastic things other museums 
have done," Robings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pluckiness has always characterized the museum. It has helped it survive as a 
cultural oasis for more than eight decades in a city once called a cow town -- 
by a deputy mayor, no less -- and in a county with no tradition of support for 
the arts (the county government will spend about $43,000 on the arts this 
fiscal year compared with Santa Barbara County's $840,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Started as a county-run department in 1914, the museum owes its origin to 
pioneer families and its longevity to their descendants who, along with a 
devoted corps of volunteer docents, continue to give the museum all the tender, 
loving care of a family heirloom. The present 25-member board of directors 
echoes with mainline names from the county's early days: Corvarrubias, Orcutt, 
Smith, Marriott, Dailey, Dudley, Leavens, Banner, Miedema, Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family has always been interested in supporting the museum -- we come from 
pioneer stock and want to preserve the past," said Katherine (Kay) Hobson 
Haley, the museum's financial adviser, and the great-granddaughter of William 
Dewey Hobson, known as the "father of Ventura County" and daughter of Edith 
Hobson Hoffman, a major benefactor of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is an offshoot of the Society of Ventura County Pioneers, which was 
created on the steps of the county courthouse 103 years ago. According to 
Robings, Cephas L. Bard, regarded as the "first white doctor in the county," 
was elected president. Bard collected Chumash artifacts, many of which, in lieu 
of cash, were given for medical services. He left his collection to the society 
when he died in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
 With no quarters of its own to display the 229 artifacts, the society donated 
them to the county in 1913. At a meeting in December, 1914, the Board of 
Supervisors adopted a resolution to finance the Ventura County Pioneer Museum. 
The collection was exhibited in the Chamber of Commerce room at the county 
courthouse (which later became Ventura City Hall). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county contributed $150,000 to $200,000 a year in operating costs 
and officially ran the museum, the society continued to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Society member E. M. Sheridan was curator for 23 years, and he never met a 
curio he didn't like. He displayed family photos, peculiar shaped rocks, pink 
Kewpie dolls, square nails, shoe boxes filled with arrowheads. And then there 
was the ever-popular two-headed lamb, which was born on a Hidden Valley farm in 
the early '30s, stuffed and given to the museum shortly thereafter, Delee 
Marshall says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a real small-town museum," said Marshall, a 76-year-old Ventura 
resident. "People would bring us anything that was a curiosity. Sheridan would 
put it in a case and make a label. We had no real theme." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, the county finally moved the museum into a squat, 3,000-square-foot 
building at 77 California St. Eight years later, the Ventura County Historical 
Society -- successor to the Pioneer Society -- signed a contract with the 
county to operate the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, Edith Hobson Hoffman led a fund-raising campaign to build a larger 
and more architecturally appealing building. When she died in 1970 at the age 
of 80, county Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg tapped her daughter to 
take charge of the money-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at a meeting and he put his hand on my shoulder and said to the 
assembled group: 'Let's put Kay in charge -- I know she'll get it done,' " said 
Haley, a feisty 74-year-old who lives on a 350-acre ranch overlooking Lake 
Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley was the logical choice. In the '60s, Edith Hoffman had purchased a 
parcel of land for the purpose of building the new museum, but the property was 
not only too small, it was found to contain Chumash artifacts, putting it 
off-limits to development. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after their mother died, Haley and her brother, land magnate Walter 
Hoffman, donated to the museum an appropriate half-acre of land across the 
street from the mission. The museum, in turn, sold it to the city for about 
$55,000; in exchange, the city gave the museum a 99-year lease, at $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley and Hoffman, with the help of then-Ventura City Councilwoman Barbara 
Udsen, raised more than $650,000 to build a handsome hacienda-like building 
with terra-cotta floors, cedar beams and 15,700 square feet of space. Haley 
even contributed succulents from her ranch to landscape the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The museum would not be there today without Kay Haley and Walter Hoffman," 
Esparza said. "I always told people I worked for Kay Haley even though she had 
no official designation." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Edith Hoffman, the museum's biggest benefactor was Fritz 
Huntsinger, a Ventura philanthropist who put up $350,000. Galleries bearing 
their names greeted visitors at the museum's grand opening in June, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything went smoothly for the little museum -- until the county pulled the 
plug. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the passage of Proposition 13 forced the county to make radical 
budget cuts. To save about $200,000 a year, the Board of Supervisors ended the 
county's 64-year relationship with the museum. Losing all its funding, the 
museum had no income or operating capital. Haley remembers her reaction to the 
county's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was speechless," she said. "We all were." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors at first considered closing the museum, Esparza says, 
but then decided to go on without county help. Lending itself $50,000 from 
funds left over from building construction, paring staff and launching a 
corporate membership drive -- 200 were sold at $100 each -- the museum was able 
to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Independence from the county is now viewed as a stroke of good fortune. In 
three years, the museum was able to pay back the $50,000 loan and become 
entirely self-supporting, Esparza says. Even with an annual operating budget of 
about $350,000 today, the museum manages to break even by relying on 1,800 
members, donations and admissions from 27,000 annual visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also has a $700,000 endowment, which is minuscule compared with 
some museums (even the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's $21-million endowment 
is considered paltry by national standards). Aside from receiving $35,000 a 
year from the city of Ventura, the museum also charges the county $20,000 for 
taking care of the Bard collection and storing county archives in the museum 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Being dropped by the county "forced the museum to become much more of a 
community institution," said Esparza, now executive director of the Nevada 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1978 crises, the museum sent out an SOS to the community. "We 
figured out how much it cost to run the museum for a day, an hour and a 
minute," Esparza said, "and people would give us money to keep us open. School 
kids brought in bags of quarters. Somebody even sent in a check for $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the board of directors -- once almost the exclusive domain of pioneer 
descendants -- became more diversified. "Used to be that bloodlines were 
everything on the board," said Hendricks, the docent. "Now they want people 
from all spheres of (society)." 
</P>
<P>
 While some museum boards have a reputation for meddling in operational and 
curatorial affairs instead of concentrating on setting policy and raising 
money, the local board of directors "has been fairly hands off," said Kathy 
Hartman, assistant curator. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum that was spearheaded by pioneers will no longer see county history 
through their eyes. In the redesigned museum, the pioneers' romanticized 
version of the West will be replaced by a new interpretation based on ethnic 
and environmental conflicts, says Margo McBane, who wrote the grant that won 
the NEH award. This shift away from the pioneers' perspective, however, does 
not bother even those board members with strong ties to the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The museum may have been by and for old families, but it's for everyone in 
Ventura County now," said William L. Orcutt, incoming board president and 
descendant of a pioneer Santa Paula family. "I've been fighting to get the 
(historical exhibits) changed. It's absolutely mandatory. Our interpretation is 
very archaic." 
</P>
<P>
 Curator Schiffer expects the redesign to take the museum to a higher level. 
"The NEH grant is a quantum leap for the museum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing redesign plans in the next few months, the museum will apply 
for another NEH grant to implement the changes. "If we do everything right, we 
should get the grant," Schiffer said. "Getting the first one was the hard 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 While upgrading its history displays, the museum may also buff up its art 
image. Although a permanent collection of George Stuart Historical Figures is 
highly respected, and the annual Assembly of the Arts (a competition for local 
artists currently running through Sunday) is well-received by critics, the 
museum is not known for putting on daring art shows. 
</P>
<P>
 All that could change with the arrival of Schiffer, who ran the College of 
Creative Studies Gallery at UC Santa Barbara and has a reputation for injecting 
excitement into his shows. Hired in October, Schiffer, 39, doesn't know whether 
he will be able to stretch the aesthetic in Ventura: "That remains to be seen," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the annual hunt for cash and endowments, museum officials are 
considering a much-needed expansion. The museum's 170 docents have to meet at a 
church because the museum lacks a multipurpose auditorium. Art collections have 
been turned down because the museum has no extra storage space. The Huntsinger 
Gallery, home to the historical displays, only has room to exhibit a fraction 
of the 23,571 objects in the museum's collection. And the highly respected 
upstairs research library, with 25,000 photos, 5,000 books and 500 maps, "is 
jammed to the ceiling," said Librarian Charles Johnson, associate director of 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Yount, a board member and chairman of the planning committee, expects 
the museum to begin a major fund-raising effort this year, after expansion 
plans are "totally in place and we have all our ducks in a row." She believes 
that the museum is well-positioned to make dramatic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Others share her optimism. "This museum is going places," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the two-headed lamb, no doubt.

Q & A WITH TIM SCHIFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Josef Woodard 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Schiffer, the Ventura County Museum of History and Art's new curator, is a 
bright, soft-spoken sort, with a broad-based curiosity and a penchant for 
change and challenge -- within reason. A taste for moderate change is a 
characteristic job requirement in a museum such as Ventura's -- aiming to 
please as large and wide a crowd as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old Yale graduate spent eight years teaching at the College of 
Creative Studies, an academic enclave at UCSB. At CCS, Schiffer gained valuable 
experience running the gallery space, known for its chance-taking exhibitions 
outside of commercial or general public considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another story entirely at the Ventura museum, where accountability is 
paramount, an active board and membership check every move, and aesthetic 
conservatism is the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his arrival in the curator's chair last October almost coincided with 
the museum's plum National Endowment for the Humanities grant, Schiffer is seen 
by many as a timely force for positive evolution at a key time in the museum's 
history. "I think some people expect me to work some sort of wonder and do a 
make-over with this museum, and it's not in my job description," he said, 
laughing. "I'm just trying to do my job." 
</P>
<P>
 But the very nature of that job may be in transition, as the museum goes 
through a growth spurt and continues to refine its identity -- one that wavers 
on a line between history and art. Schiffer recently spoke about riding that 
fine line. The next day, he was off to Washington, D.C., to learn a thing or 
two from the NEH. 
</P>
<P>
 How does this new role differ from the job you had at UCSB? 
</P>
<P>
 This is much more complex, because there are more people involved. This museum 
has a lot of different facets to it. It's a historical society with a library 
and there is a mixture of art shows and historical shows. That makes it a bit 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the whole organization of the museum -- the board, the docents. 
It's a much larger institution. It involves working with a lot more people. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the issue and importance of diplomacy come up more often? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, to a certain extent. I'm trying to coordinate the different activities -- 
the tours, the membership drive, long-range planning for the museum that we 
need to be aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 The NEH grant that we just got is, for me, very exciting. My part of it 
involves coordinating the efforts of a number of different people to try and 
get this plan for the new exhibit done. There is a lot of responsibility 
attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like this grant might usher in the next phase of the museum's life. 
Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 I think so. I think this museum is on a definite upward tack. I hope that it 
will allow us to have a really good installation in the gallery. This museum 
gets a lot of use by school kids and tour groups, so it should be really good. 
It's one of the only things of its kind that's available in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The art aspect of the museum came into being much later than the historical 
component. Does that color the attitude toward exhibitions? 
</P>
<P>
 There is, not animosity, but some people in the membership favor the 
historical aspect, and some favor the art aspect. When they changed it to the 
Ventura County Museum of History and Art, some people thought that was a good 
change, and some didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 I think people are OK with it. I gave a lecture about art a few weeks ago and 
40 of the docents showed up. That was a good showing. A lot of the shows that 
we do are crossover between history and art, like the (late Santa Paula artist) 
Cornelius Bottke show coming up. We're going to do a show of all his etchings. 
He's part of the history of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, I'm going to do a tool show this summer -- featuring 
historical tools and appliances. I think that will go in the opposite way: It's 
a historical show that will have an art side to it, because a lot of those 
tools are almost art. Old tools get into the art realm. 
</P>
<P>
 My idea is that you try to have a variety of shows so that people will be 
encouraged to come in and broaden their interests a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you feel that you have to do that with kid gloves on, not stepping too far 
outside of certain parameters of taste? 
</P>
<P>
 I would say that I don't see it being a museum for cutting-edge contemporary 
art. I just don't think that's what the museum is about. The mission of the 
museum, as it's written, is about Ventura County art-wise and history-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of what the art shows should do would be to encourage artists in Ventura 
County and give them some kind of venue to show their work, and also to show 
historical work that relates somehow to the county or is by county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, I'm hoping to do a show of Otto and Vivika Heino, the ceramic 
artists from Ojai. They've been here since the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you have in mind to change the identity of the museum? 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because there's an endowment in the museum now for art exhibits, I 
think that will change the identity of the museum in terms of what kinds of 
things it's able to present. There is funding for doing good art shows and 
catalogues, occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a fine arts committee that provides support for doing the art shows. 
They organize the Assembly of the Arts show on their own. It's a really 
positive group. 
</P>
<P>
 They're interested in forming a collection of art as opposed to just 
historical things. We own a few nice paintings and a few prints and things, but 
they're interested in trying to keep artwork in the county and eventually -- if 
the museum expands -- having a permanent exhibition space for artwork. We've 
drawn up an art accession policy. 
</P>
<P>
 And you play a critical role in that whole process of accenting the art of the 
museum's title? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my background is in art, but right now I'm finishing the Portuguese 
show, which will be the next show. I've put a lot of energy into that. It's 
about Portuguese immigration to Ventura County and the Portuguese community. 
It's funny: It's taken a lot more time than a comparable art show would take, 
because I have to find all the material. Josef Woodard

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THAI FOR THE TIMID AND THE ADVENTUROUS; A NEW OJAI EATERY 
SERVES UP FRESH AND EXCITING FOOD WITHOUT RELYING ON SUGAR AND MSG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While you can't fish for fresh salmon in the waters around Thailand, a small 
Thai restaurant in Ojai has come up with a specialty of fresh salmon poached in 
a Thai spicy and sour broth. The marriage of flavors in this dish is marvelous, 
and makes a compelling argument for the shrinking global village. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the restaurant is certainly a citizen of this village. Chieko 
Latawan Lopez came from Northern Thailand as a teen-age exchange student to 
live with a family in Santa Paula. Later, while attending Ventura College, she 
met her husband, who had been born in Mexico. She says she opened Lanna Thai 
six months ago for two reasons: "I love to cook; and I love to hear people say, 
'I love your food.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A cheerful, yet casual place with a patio garden decor, most of the 
restaurant's dishes conform to traditional Thai cooking, except that they 
contain very little sugar and no MSG. The kitchen also makes use of a greater 
variety of fresh vegetables than I've seen in other Thai restaurants, and the 
dishes are not as explodingly hot as Thai food can get. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the outstanding spicy and sour salmon soup ($12.95), all the soups 
were excellent here, most of them built on the same base of hot lemony broth, 
laced with lemon grass, lots of mushrooms and, in the case of tom kha ($3.25), 
a taste of coconut milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the perfect place to take, as we did one day, someone who is leery of 
Thai food. We showed our Nervous Nellie how a person can order a meal of won 
ton soup (very tasty), garden rolls (similar to spring rolls) and Thai fried 
rice with assorted vegetables (fairly bland) and come away thinking the food 
isn't that different from mild Cantonese cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are much more exciting meals to be concocted, from both the 
regular and vegetarian menus. For starters, I liked the yum woon sen salad 
($5.95) with its thin silver noodles and warm, savory lime dressing. Even 
better, pla goong salad ($7.95) had grilled shrimp on top of spikes of julienne 
vegetables, with lemon grass, mint, cilantro and zesty chilies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pad Thai ($6.95), a classic rendition of this popular noodle dish came with 
sticky, orange-colored noodles and chubby shrimp, garnished with cooked eggs, 
bean sprouts and peanut crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Every curry I tasted here was appetizing, including kang ped ($5.95), a mild 
curry with plenty of bamboo shoots and kang ka ree, and a dulcet yellow curry 
made with potatoes and onions and coconut milk. The two standouts were the 
prawn curry ($7.95) made with red peppers, carrots and peas, and pleasingly 
sweetened with chunks of pineapple, and a classic panang curry, consisting only 
of meat and red peppers coated with a spicy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Another dish, mint leaves ($5.95), which came with a choice of meat (the beef 
was a bit tough), created an arresting dialogue of flavor between the mint and 
the chilies. While the service was terrific, and the prices were quite good, it 
wouldn't hurt to improve the quality of the meat they're using. 
</P>
<P>
 This place is also kid-friendly, and happy meals for the little ones would 
include the chicken coconut soup, spring rolls and skewered, barbecued meat 
satay ($6.25). 
</P>
<P>
 For young and old, they offered one dessert: homemade Thai coconut ice cream, 
a pleasingly icy concoction. Textured with hard flecks of coconut and, believe 
it or not, bits of corn, we thought it also contained green peas, but were told 
that was "Thai Jell-O." I like surprises, especially when they taste so good. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said she has a woman cooking in the kitchen who used to cook with lots 
of sugar and MSG. The woman at first strongly resisted the restrictions against 
their use. According to Lopez, it wasn't long before she came to her and 
announced, "Oh boss, you really proved it." Details

EARTHWATCH: NEW POLICIES INSURE AGAINST TAINTED LAND; EMERGING SPECIALTY MAY BE 
ONE WAY TO CLEAN UP CITIES AND FARMS FASTER THAN THE EPA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Until recently, I would never have thought to turn to an insurance broker for 
help in saving the planet. But it turns out they might be playing a more 
important role in this effort than one might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 John Theiss, a Westlake resident, is a liability insurance executive who deals 
with places as big as the L.A. subway and as small as a trailer park. His 
specialty is the new field of "environmental liability transfer insurance" -- 
policies designed to give real estate owners and their bankers some peace of 
mind when they're worried they might get stuck with toxic turf on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few (commercial sellers) are sitting on property that isn't 
contaminated," Theiss says, referring to American business's messy past. 
</P>
<P>
 For us regular folks who aren't burdened with any real estate to sell, this 
new wrinkle in the insurance business is nevertheless of interest. It just 
might be the way to clean up America's environmentally damaged cities and farms 
faster than government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Theiss and other local experts I consulted say some newly available real 
estate insurance policies "allow for the funding of cleanup," as he put it. 
Such policies until recently were hard to get and prohibitively expensive. But, 
according to Theiss, since the industry has turned to biologists, chemists and 
other scientists -- instead of lawyers and statisticians -- to calculate risks, 
they have been able to get realistic estimates of costs. Now insurance 
companies don't have to charge sky-high premiums out of fear of the unknown. 
Several new firms have appeared, specializing in this type of insurance. One 
company in Wisconsin is even called Planet Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by the public's demand that we not be gassed, toxified or irradiated by 
negligent neighbors, legislatures have passed environmental laws with teeth in 
them -- but held back on public funding for such cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a result of U.S. Supreme Court decisions this year, owners and their 
mortgage bankers -- even if they themselves did not do the dirtying -- may have 
to pay for environmental cleanup instead of leaving the job to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Canny buyers these days won't take possession of certain kinds of real estate 
until they know they're covered by one of these new policies. They are 
demanding that the seller either clean up environmental messes beforehand or 
provide appropriate insurance. Real estate sellers will be provoked into 
environmental virtue by the threat of never finding a willing buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Theiss was one of many people I contacted who predicted that this is going to 
be an element in almost every future real estate transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Eric Voulgaris, an industrial property specialist with the realty 
firm Grubb & Ellis in Oxnard, environmental insurance will "probably be more 
important than title insurance eventually." Meaning: It may be more important 
that you prove you have clean land than clean title. 
</P>
<P>
 Once sellers have gone through these hoops and dealt promptly with whatever 
environmental issues turn up, they can even get reasonably priced insurance 
against future, unforeseen, environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one expert, Jim Fitzpatrick of PHW Environmental Risk Services in 
the rust belt city of Troy, Mich., "This (trend) is even heading toward the 
residential area -- to protect the value from collapsing due to an 
environmental exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 Patt McDaniel of McDaniel Insurance Services in Ventura cautioned about 
announcing an environmental millennium, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (new) policy forms are not standardized . . . and there are important 
differences in the policy features offered by various companies . . . and an 
environmental risk assessment survey is required." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, one thing is certain: If a property is purchased and turns out 
to have an environmental problem, it may be too late to obtain coverage to 
clean it up. Details 
</P>
<P>

liability and cleanup, is now becoming available. Consult your insurance 
broker. Other sources are McDaniel Insurance Services, (805) 658-1084; Jim 
Theiss, (818) 548-7500; ERIC Underwriters Agency, (800) 234-9221; and United

THE RIGHT STUFF; FROM IMPORTED CHEESES TO HALAL MEATS, THERE'S A MARKET FOR 
EVERYTHING HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ever-changing demographic of Orange County has brought with it an 
explosion of ethnic awareness. One way to get acquainted with other cultures is 
through the kitchen. After experiencing an exotic dish at a restaurant, there 
is often the urge to reproduce it at home, something best accomplished after a 
visit to one of our many ethnic specialty markets. 
</P>
<P>
 This is only a smattering of what is out there, but it is a good 
cross-section. A more in-depth look at ethnic markets crops up periodically in 
the Thursday Food section, whenever Linda Burum's pieces are featured. Burum, 
author of "A Guide To Ethnic Foods in Los Angeles" (Harper Perennial, $11), 
knows more about markets than anyone I've met. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of pure exotica, nothing beats an Asian entry like the Bolsa 
Supermarket in Westminster's Little Saigon, which caters to both the Chinese 
and Vietnamese community. On a street lined with huge food emporia like Little 
Saigon Supermarket, Viet Hoa and others, this is my favorite. Nowhere else is 
it more apparent how the foods of those regions differ from our own products. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, there is a greater emphasis on freshness. You'll find few processed 
foods in here, save the pickled and sweetened items used to enhance the Asian 
table. Second, there is a mind-numbing array of foods that we simply do not use 
in Western cooking. One way to familiarize yourself with these foods is to grab 
a copy of "Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients" (William Morrow, $22.95). Another 
way is to mill around in here, keeping your eyes, ears, and especially your 
nose, open. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin a journey to this market in the huge produce section, where dozens of 
fruits and vegetables unseen in most Western markets sit on display alongside 
the more familiar ones. There are piles of fresh water chestnuts, green 
tamarind, bushels of pea shoots, bins of thick-skinned pomelos (similar to a 
grapefruit, only sweeter), betel leaves and dozens of fragrant herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, walk back to the enormous fish department, perhaps the biggest in 
the county, where live shellfish tanks stocked with Manila clams, baby lobster, 
crab and much more are flanked by whole tilapia, carp, stripers and an endless 
array of shrimps, laid out, eyes open, in row after row. 
</P>
<P>
 Several aisles are devoted to fish sauces and salted condiments that the south 
Asian table cannot do without: nuoc mam, chili sauces, oyster sauce, flavored 
soys -- a staggering inventory. There are noodles, noodles and more noodles, 
fashioned out of rice flour, wheat, even beans, most of them made by local 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the front of the store are the rices, sold mostly in bulk packages of 
either 25 or 50 pounds (expect to pay about $10 for 25 pounds, depending on the 
brand and quality). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is a huge housewares section where cooking equipment, plates, 
rice bowls and chop sticks are sold. In short, everything you'll need to cook a 
first-class Asian dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Supermarket, 9550 Bolsa Ave., Westminster. (714) 839-8002. Open daily, 9 
a.m. to 9 p.m.  
</P>

 Pascal and Mimi Olhats of Pascal restaurant took a calculated risk opening 
Pascal Epicerie and Wine, a small French market housed in a free-standing 
building adjacent to the couple's restaurant. An epicerie is, in Pascal's own 
words, "a grocery store for spices, cheeses, canned foods." What the Olhatses 
have opened is really more of an epicerie fine , adding house-made charcuterie, 
pastry, fine wines. Suffice to say that there is nothing else like it in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a rustic, decidedly upscale place, done in the earthy colors of a 
Mediterranean village, complete with slate floor, a wine cellar and tasting 
tables. Don't bother looking for the products sold here in Vons or Lucky. Many 
of these foods are prepared on the premises in a large rear kitchen: cooking 
aids such as basic stocks; pates like a smooth duck terrine, creamy chicken 
liver mousse or peasanty beef daube; packaged dinners; homemade croissants and 
pastries; great sandwiches like grilled lamb with feta. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal says it is his restaurant customers who convinced him to open this type 
of shop, but he confided that he has already pulled in lots of business from 
the local French community. There are jams, vinegars and teas from the famous 
Fauchon in Paris, breads are trucked in daily from La Brea Bakery in Los 
Angeles. Cheeses, which often vary greatly in terms of ripeness, are decidedly 
French -- classics such as Epoisse, Reblochon and St. Marcellin (tiny rounds of 
goat cheese suspended in herbed olive oil) and the more familiar Brie and 
Camembert. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the features that Pascal is most proud of is his ever-changing array of 
takeout cooked dinners, sold at $7.95. This is a chance to taste signature 
dishes from the restaurant -- sea bass with thyme crust, a rich seafood stew 
and others -- in your own home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wines are another draw here, and moderate price is again the selling point. In 
the totally separate wine room, wines from all over France are displayed. The 
majority of the inventory is kept in a temperature-controlled cellar, but the 
entire inventory is displayed in an inventive wooden rack, which runs around 
the room's perimeter. Among good buys are a '90 Fonsalette for $19.90, a crisp 
Sancerre for $10.50 and the venerable La Vielle Ferme red from Provence, $7. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal Epicerie and Wine, 1000 Bristol St., Newport Beach. (714) 261-9041. 
Open Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Closed Sunday.

<P>
 What a feast is Al Tayebat, an Anaheim market whose name means "wonderful 
tastes" in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling this colorful, boisterous market "stocked" would be a case of classic 
understatement. Walking in, you get a full dose of the sights, sounds and 
smells of the Middle East. The perfumes of coffee, coriander and olives hit you 
first, then the Arabic music. It's dizzying for a first-time visitor, but the 
women, many in shawls with children in tow, don't appear the least bit fazed. 
They are too busy packing up their carts with the bountiful foods of their 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 One side of the market contains row after row of rainbow-colored produce, 
peppers, eggplant, fresh herbs, tomatoes bursting with ripeness. In the rear, 
there is a counter for halal meat (butchered according to Islamic law) where 
the market's butchers prepare homemade sausages called ma'ani and the cracked 
bulgur wheat and ground lamb dish known as kibbeh . 
</P>
<P>
 Proprietor Sami Khouraki is proud of the wide variety of dry goods necessary 
for the preparation of a good Middle Eastern meal. There are large burlap bags 
of fragrant basmati rice, bulgur and semolina wheats, and fresh spices such as 
cumin, allspice and cardamom, vital to the home cooks who shop here. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallon cans of imported olive oil are stacked nearly to the ceiling, exotic 
sounding brand names such as Middle East, Indo-European and Al Wazir. There are 
long, flat loaves of fresh Afghani bread, the sesame confection halwa (halava 
in English), dried apricots imported from Turkey, honeys, pistachios, even a 
wide selection of European candies and specialty items. 
</P>
<P>
 "My customers are a sophisticated lot from all over the Middle East," Khouraki 
says, "and they are used to products from Europe as well as from their own 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Should you find the prospect of confronting so many unfamiliar foodstuffs 
daunting, head for the cookware and cookbook aisle in this store. Al Tayebat 
sells several Lebanese and Middle Eastern cookbooks, as well as the various 
cooking implements a fledgling Middle Eastern cook needs to get started. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Tayebat, 1217 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714) 520-4723. Open Monday 
through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Closed Sunday.

 From the robust tastes of the Middle East we go to the delicate, almost 
ethereal flavors of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebisu Market is part of a family business started 10 years ago by Kazuto 
Takeda. The market has expanded into a bakery, ramen (Japanese noodles, eaten 
in soup) shop and soon-to-be-opened Japanese spaghetti parlor.  
</P>
<P>
 The heart and soul of any Japanese market is the fish counter; because many 
Japanese people fancy raw fish, the quality of the fish sold has to be near 
perfect. Ebisu's fish counter features a wood slat board written in the 
Japanese syllabary called hiragana , just as you will see in a Little Tokyo 
sushi bar. But not to worry, the English names are right there, in small print 
next to the fish themselves. The fine selection includes gorgeous chunks of 
yellowtail, whole pompano, flounder and assorted exotica. It's as impressive as 
you'll find anywhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The market is further notable for fine produce such as gobo (burdock root); 
small, flavorful Japanese eggplant; pumpkin; Japanese sugar potatoes; various 
seaweeds; dried and pickled roots; mushrooms and everything necessary to make a 
good Japanese dashi , the soup stock that most Japanese dishes depend on. Of 
course there is plenty of Japanese rice, and the rice cookers that you'll need 
to prepare it properly. Takeda's son Joe has a special line of tuna jerky made 
especially for him. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also find a huge inventory of sakes; Japanese beers such as my 
favorite, Ichiban Shibori from Kirin; teas, such as the caffeine-free hojicha 
and the ubiquitous green tea; a whole aisle of the rice crackers called senbei 
, and various other Japanese products, ranging from bento box lunches to 
ceramic chopstick rests. Should you get uncontrollably hungry during all this, 
there is, surprise, a take-out sushi counter, back of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebisu Market, 18930-40 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 962-2108. Open 
Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.  
</P>

 Sydney and Mario Silvi opened Al Dente 11 years back, more out of necessity 
than ambition. When it comes to the staples of Italian cooking, this crowded 
but elegant Los Alamitos market has nearly all bases covered. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll gasp, as I did, when you see just how complete a market it is. The 
starting point has to be the pasta section, where pastas in undreamed of size, 
shape and color reside. The Silvis use five different companies to get the 
largest variety of cuts, anything from al carciofo -- artichoke in the dough -- 
to patrician air-dried pastas in brown paper sacks that are two to three times 
more expensive than the cellophane-packaged versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to the market's huge, glassed-in deli counter for salumeria (cold cuts and 
sausages) and cheeses. Al Dente sells more than 15 different types of salamis 
(purveyed locally or in Canada), prosciutto from San Daniele in Italy's Friuli 
province (which aficionados consider the world's finest), and the best imported 
Parmigiano for livening up that pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 There are chefs in the rear kitchen who make lasagnas, stuffed shells and 
sauces for your pasta, tonno (tuna), pesto, Bolognese, Arrabbiata and more sold 
at $4.95 for a half pint. The condiment section contains flavored vinegars; a 
wondrous selection of nut oils; specialty items such as Agrumata, olive oil 
perfumed with orange rind and tomatoes in ways you didn't know existed; pickled 
garlic; fancy mustards, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally there are breads, in this case brought in from a Sun Valley bakery 
called Pane Pane that Mrs. Silvi swears is the best around. The breads, by the 
way, have zero fat, dairy products or sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 The back room is the most crowded part of the market, with wines, candies, 
aprons, place mats, coffees. There is a great selection of top-drawer Chiantis, 
Brunellos and Barolos, as well as modest wines at one-fifth the price of the 
big hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Italians are big on their candies, and the inventory peaks around Easter. Look 
for chocolates such as hazelnut-filled Baci (kisses) from Perugia, the coated 
nougat called torrone , Amaretti cookies, biscotti for dipping in coffee. 
Coffee? No problem. Al Dente sells coffees from Illy, Pasquini and other 
well-known coffee makers, not to mention espresso pots and complicated looking 
gadgets fitted with milk steamers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mmmm, mmm. Make sure your trunk is empty before you head out. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Dente, 11092 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos. (310) 698-1124. Open Tuesday 
through Saturday, 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 4 p.m. Closed Monday.

 The cooking of Mexico has long been popular here, and the advent of large 
chains such as Viva and Tianguis, often featuring comals (griddles) that churn 
out fresh tortillas like an assembly line, make shopping for Mexican foods 
easier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 I still prefer the small, neighborhood markets for this kind of shopping, 
places such as El Toro in Santa Ana. El Toro has wonderful cuts of meats -- 
marinated steak, oxtail, pig's knuckles, honeycomb tripe, chorizo -- and a 
homey feeling that I find comforting. Where else would you find pinatas 
suspended from the ceiling, hear mariachis blaring from oversized speakers, and 
be able to munch on cajetas de leche (milk fudge) or calabasas (candied 
pumpkin) as you shop? 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans tend to buy their grains and legumes in bulk, and most of the beans, 
rices and corn products sit in huge rear bins, waiting for shoppers to scoop 
them up into plastic bags. I counted nearly a dozen types of fresh chilies -- 
among others, chipotles, poblanos, anchos and guajillos -- in here, and at 
least two dozen more varieties dried and packaged in four-ounce plastic bags. 
Of course there is handsome produce such as avocados, jicamas, papayas and a 
wide selection of leafy vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it would be more convenient, even less expensive, to shop in the big 
bright Mexican supermarket chains. But I don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole point of shopping ethnic, for me, is to absorb a little of the true 
essence of a culture. That's what makes an experience such as this worthwhile 
and what makes the food on the table taste special. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro, 1340 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 836-1393. Open daily, 7 a.m. to 10 
p.m.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: MOTORHEAD, "ORGASMATRON" (1986), SINCLAIR  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Motorhead first revved up its cacophonous engine back in the mid-'70s, 
many critics chided the group for its exceptionally brutish delivery and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two decades later -- now that Motorhead has influenced a plethora of 
speed and thrash demons, from Overkill to Slayer -- it is clear that the 
heaviest of the British metal bands actually was a pioneering outfit, years 
ahead of its time. 
</P>
<P>
 The last great Motorhead album, "Orgasmatron" ranks with "Ace of Spades" and 
"Bomber" as one of the scuzzy unit's most intensely satisfying. Chock full of 
humongous guitar riffs and throbbing, fat-bottomed rhythms, this is work 
designed for the most incorrigible headbanger; fans who favor such pop-metal 
acts as Poison need not apply for membership in the relatively small but loyal 
Motorhead army. Still, like the best of the band's albums, "Orgasmatron" offers 
hooks aplenty. You definitely can sing yourself hoarse to such big-time rockers 
as "Deaf Forever" and "Built for Speed," or revel in the meaty guitar figures 
found in "Claw." 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the thundering music here is defined in large part by 
vocalist-bassist Lemmy Kilminster's guttural growl. Lemmy has the type of 
menacing vocal style that can send small children and animals scurrying for 
cover. He's the perfect vehicle for the macho bluster found in tracks like 
"Mean Machine." Play this one loud. JON MATSUMOTO

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: GONE, "THE CRIMINAL MIND", SST  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people, at least some of the time, like to have their brains pulverized 
by a rampant rock guitar. Gone exists to satisfy that desire. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio, led by former Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn, takes an 
all-instrumental approach, the better to carry out its purpose without having 
itself or the listener sidetracked by the complications of verbal 
communication. Pure sensation is the primary objective, with Ginn's guitars and 
his band mates' drums and bass marshaled for maximum impact. The album contains 
no ballads or quiet interludes. Often, the drums hammer with the drill-press 
slam of industrial rock. The guitar is solely an abrasive instrument, scraping 
and straining. This is emphatically not recommended for those who dislike 
racket. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who crave a bit of noise, Gone arranges it deftly. For all the 
rawness of his delivery, Ginn is a sharp crafter of riffs, and that's what he 
primarily deals in on this album. His dissonant solos, mercifully brief, are 
intended strictly to plant a moment's chaos in the heart with numbers that are 
otherwise coherently structured. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks themselves are brief (the average is under three minutes) as Gone 
establishes a riff, savors it and then quickly lets it go. Without that 
brevity, music this pounding and insistent would leave a listener insensate; 
Gone wants its audience to remain sufficiently conscious to appreciate the 
bludgeoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 17 tracks on "The Criminal Mind" sound as if Joe Satriani had been 
taken off his hard rock guitar-hero's shining pedestal and sentenced to make 
noise in a grimy basement. A few numbers, notably "Smoking Gun in Waco," go to 
unpleasant extremes of cacophony. But most have something tasty to offer. In 
"Pull It Out," the band advances in laboring steps, like Sisyphus pushing his 
rock, with each phrase capped by a braying guitar groan of pain and 
exhilaration. "Row Nine" is a catchy, Knack-like New Wave rocker with the 
polish taken off. And "Freeny," the longest and most elaborate piece, captures 
the simultaneous drama and goofiness of prime surf rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is clearly capable of playing with refinement, yet goes for crude impact 
as a matter of choice -- a choice that those seeking a noisy buzz are apt to 
appreciate. MIKE BOEHM

WANNA DANCE?: ROXBURY PACKS THEM IN WITH LOTS OF SUNDAY PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sundays have usually been slow evenings for clubs, unless they're hosting gay- 
or reggae-themed nights, which many have begun to do. But five Orange County 
promoters -- Groove Way, Unity, Riptide, KGB and PJ Productions -- brought the 
crowds into Roxbury South in grand style this past Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,300 TYTs (that's Trendy Young Things) walked through the doors 
that night. At 11:30, another couple hundred had to be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt much of the success had to do with the welcoming of patrons ages 18 
to 20. This was their big moment to see the illustrious club without employing 
a fake ID. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it was also their last. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the club's city-issued dance permit only covers patrons ages 21 
and older, a fact pointed out by police sometime around midnight. Sunday nights 
will go on, but without the teens. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss might not affect the party too much, since there appeared to be a 
healthy number of drinking-age patrons with plastic bracelets on hand for the 
Sunday opener. Judging by the good times everyone seemed to be having, the gig 
should get plenty of return customers. So stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggae still had a presence here, by way of the live musical stylings of 
Takaras in the bar downstairs. A different band with a different sound will be 
featured weekly. Look for the L.A. Bass Disco Sensation on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, deejays Ewok and Riff Raff, as well as guest deej Freddy Snakeskin 
of KROQ, pumped the room full of dance hits. There were some disco faves, KROQ 
flashbacks and a couple of newer alternative numbers, but it was mostly 
commercial house and pop.  
</P>
<P>
 And don't expect to flow through the club too easily, either. The stairway was 
clogged most of the night, the dance floor was almost impenetrable, and finding 
lost buddies was an exercise in search and rescue.  
</P>
<P>
 A fashion show kicked off the night Sunday, and more will be featured in 
coming weeks. That's good, because it will give organizers a chance to get it 
together. As it was, this was one of the least exciting events of the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night drink prices are $2 for domestic beers, $3.50 for imports, $4 for 
wells and wines by the glass, and $1.50 for sodas. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxbury is also open Wednesdays, with reggae below and hip hop upstairs; 
Thursdays, for the "disco is not dead" crowd, and Friday and Saturday nights, 
featuring dance hits.

COMEDY: JUGGLING LAUGHS, STUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though Orange County jugglers Owen Morse and John Wee are among an elite 
clique (Wee, in fact, knows of no other members) that can pass 10 clubs back 
and forth, they realize that's not going to keep any crowd entertained for an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 So they make sure to toss some laughs into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comedy has been part of it all along," Wee, 27, said from his Garden Grove 
home Tuesday afternoon, before opening a six-night run at the Irvine Improv. 
"It didn't take long to realize that people's interest in juggling is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting. A lot of people don't know what to expect. They lump us 
into the goofy mime/magician type of stuff. Most are quite surprised after they 
see us. It's definitely a comedy show with juggling." 
</P>
<P>
 And after Tuesday's opening show, it's obvious that local comedy fans have 
struck gold here. Besides Wee and Morse, also on the bill are O'Brien & Valdez, 
arguably the best stand-up team working today. This is as potent a 1-2 punch as 
the club can put together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Passing Zone has been together almost six years. Wee and Morse, also 27, 
met at a 1986 juggling convention in San Jose. Morse, of Lake Forest, was 
working solo in Orange County while earning a psychology degree at UC Irvine, 
and Wee was winding down a partnership in the Midwest, where he earned an 
economics degree from Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized we have a similar style, a similar sense of humor," Wee said. "We 
were interested in similar kinds of juggling. There aren't many jugglers who 
can pass nine clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Northfield, Minn., native graduated, he headed west. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long to earn recognition. In 1990, they did the first of two 
"Tonight Show" appearances and even had a chance to hit Johnny Carson with a 
fake bowling ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, they've performed at trade shows, conventions and special events 
as well as colleges, comedy clubs and pro basketball halftime shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably gone at least half the time," Wee said, adding that they also 
hold four records in the Guinness Book of World Records. "That's what's nice 
about doing Irvine. It's a chance to be on home turf." 
</P>
<P>
 What: The Passing Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 When: At 8:30 tonight, March 3; at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Friday, March 4; at 8 
and 10:30 p.m. Saturday, March 5, and at 8 p.m. Sunday, March 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Irvine Improv, 4255 Campus Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to the Jamboree Road exit and 
head south. Turn left onto Campus Drive. The Improv is in the Irvine 
Marketplace shopping center, across from the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>

KID STUFF: HITTING A BARD PATCH; GOLDEN WEST BRINGS SHAKESPEARE TO LIFE IN 
'STAGE' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "T o be, (Oh, lord, here we go . . .) or not to be, (This is, like, sooooo 
boring . . .) 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question. (Wait, was that an earthquake? No, darn it . . .) 
</P>
<P>
 Whether 'tis nobler (C'mon! I'm dying here . . .) to suffer the slings and 
arrows (Yeah, right. He should suffer through this class, sometime . . .) of 
outrageous fortune . . . (Fortune! Omigod, I forgot my lunch money!) 
</P>
<P>
 William Shakespeare may be lauded as the greatest poet and playwright in 
English literature, but if ol' Bill were alive today, even he would probably 
find high school kids a tough audience. Not that many adults don't find reading 
the Bard's works a daunting task, too. Given a choice, most of us would rather 
curl up with the manual for our Taiwanese microwave than tackle "Venus and 
Adonis." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday and Wednesday, however, Golden West College will premiere a show 
that may help ease your Bard-o-phobia. Called "All the World's a Stage: 
Shakespeare's Monologues," the one-hour student production will feature scenes 
or soliloquies from five of Shakespeare's best-known works. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehearsals have been directed by Charles Mitchell, a theater arts professor at 
GWC. But because Mitchell was in a serious car accident last week, his wife -- 
Renata Florin, an adjunct theater arts instructor at the school -- will step in 
to direct the actual run. Performances are free and will be held at 8 p.m. in 
the school's Community Theater.  
</P>
<P>
 The program is the first of its kind to be staged by the community college's 
theater department and targets high school audiences and up, said David 
Anthony, the school's dean of fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students who are reading Shakespeare will see it come to life before their 
eyes," Anthony promised. "Live theater is so different from just reading a 
play; it's being there, the ambient feeling, seeing actors and actresses in the 
roles that give the words a whole different dimension." 
</P>
<P>
 "All the World's a Stage" features 30 actors, including high-schoolers and GWC 
theater students in their 20s through 40s.  
</P>
<P>
 To create the show, Mitchell selected scenes from "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," 
"Macbeth," "As You Like It" and "The Merchant of Venice" that represent some of 
the most familiar themes in each play, including the scenes surrounding the 
murder in "Macbeth" as well as the young prince's confrontation with Ophelia, 
and the lady's subsequent insanity scene in "Hamlet." Also featured will be 
some of the most powerful and recognizable monologues from "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 The cut-and-paste approach also allowed him to put more emphasis on the female 
characters in Shakespeare's canon, said Mitchell. Scenes featuring Lady Macbeth 
(including the famous "Out, out, damn spot" soliloquy) and Portia (doing her 
courtroom scene) from "The Merchant of Venice" are among the selections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Golden West has steered away from Shakespeare for its public 
performances, running more toward musical theater and mysteries. The main 
reason, Mitchell said, was money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do a multi-scene approach, Shakespeare is very expensive to produce 
and it doesn't draw like a musical," he explained. To cut costs, GWC students 
constructed a versatile Old Globe-style set as well as Renaissance-era costumes 
that could be used for multiple productions. Both were used last season when 
GWC performed "The Comedy of Errors," and will be seen again Friday through 
March 13 in a staging of "Romeo and Juliet," as well as in "All the World's a 
Stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell compared his new monologue program to a revue ("You could call it 
'The Best of Shakespeare,' " he said with a laugh), and says he's eager to see 
how young adults respond to it. If funding could be found, he said he would 
consider repackaging it as a touring show that could visit area high school 
theater and literature classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to perform (Shakespeare works) as much as possible, to introduce 
audiences to it as well as our own students," explained Mitchell. "This is a 
learning experience for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 What: "All the World's a Stage: Shakespeare's Monologues." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Tuesday and Wednesday, March 8 and 9, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Golden West College Community Theater, 15744 Golden West St., 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit at Golden West Street and 
drive south. Turn left on McFadden Avenue, then right on Gothard Street. 
Metered parking is available in the Gothard Street lot.

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: WORLD TOUR LOOKS FOR BIGGER SPLASH IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An item in one of the surfing magazines about a vote taken by the Assn. of 
Surfing Professionals board, which runs the world tour, caught the eye of 
Rockin' Fig and me. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is going to move the location of the final stop on the World 
Championship Tour from Hawaii's famed Pipeline to Australia in December. The 
Pipeline was the victim only because the board wanted to finish the season with 
what it hopes will be a bang. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I got a lot of mixed emotions about that move, Fig said. What do you 
think?  
</P>
<P>
 Many people believe Pipeline represents surfing's mystique. More than any 
other surf break, the place has symbolized the challenge, danger and beauty of 
surfing. Also, no other place has been so well-photographed so that people like 
me, who have never surfed there, can appreciate the place because of how we 
envision it. (Doesn't hurt to have a song named after it, either.) We contacted 
Graham Cassidy, the ASP's executive director, who lives in Australia but 
visited the ASP's Huntington Beach headquarters last week. 
</P>
<P>
 What's been the reaction to the change, Graham? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a mixed reaction," he said. "Some view it as a daring move. . . . 
In terms of people's perceptions of Hawaii, they think of the (great) waves. 
But the tour has to think beyond just the waves." 
</P>
<P>
 In Australia, the finals will receive greater fan support and greater media 
attention, Cassidy explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "More to the point, it's difficult to generate interest here and around the 
world from a rock in the middle of the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh man, I don't like that comment. Hawaii is the place where the real waves 
are, and for me, it sounds like a great place to have the finals. Media-wise it 
might not be as good as Australia.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides media attention, Cassidy said the move would give Australians an 
opportunity to host a mobile contest. 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, some of the best surfing contests are scheduled with a 
waiting period of days or weeks, with the particular break to be determined 
later. This helps organizers hold the contest at the best locale and in the 
best wave conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian surfers, Cassidy said, enjoy a vast following like that accorded to 
pro tennis or golf stars in the United States. Organizers are planning to have 
a long waiting period sometime in December and a "700-mile window" along 
Australian's eastern coast for the final contest.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to bring back the safari style of surfing," Cassidy said. "We 
may have everybody on buses and airplanes ready to head out." 
</P>
<P>
 People may not understand that and won't appreciate the move, Cassidy 
acknowledged. But he added that when the ASP tour hits Australia, it's treated 
like a Formula One race. The venue cities open up, and there's heavy coverage 
by newspapers and TV, with profiles on competitors and personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, glitz. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, take the first world tour event this year, coming up at 
Australia's Bell's Beach from March 31 through April 6. Rip Curl, a big 
Australian wet-suit manufacturer, sponsors it and daily attendance is expected 
to average at least 20,000 people with the finals drawing 35,000, he said. (By 
comparison, the ASP finals at Pipeline only draw about 5,000 people, according 
to ASP figures.) 
</P>
<P>
 And in Australia, they charge $5 per car (about $3.50 U.S.). No tour event 
here has ever asked an admission fee, but charging spectators is a concept that 
will be tried in Huntington Beach this year when Prime Ticket sponsors the U.S. 
Open of Surfing from Aug. 2 through 7. It is the only world-tour event in the 
continental United States. And, get your wallets ready, because they plan to 
tentatively charge $8 per head, said Don Meek, a Prime Ticket official. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for Prime Ticket to build a surf stadium with an entertainment 
stage and an exposition area for beach products. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be neat to see the Top 16 in the world here to rip it up. We get a 
sprinkling of those guys in the Bud Surf Tour , but all those heavy-hitters 
will be there for the U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
 What works in Australia could work in Orange County, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of having the U.S. Open here in Huntington Beach in August is that 
a lot of people who follow surfing will be coming out of that event thinking 
about the world tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Fig's already psyched. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Op Pro right before the Open, that means two pretty big contests in a 
ro w right here in HB. I know I want to see it happen.  
</P>
<P>
 Contests: The U.S. Bud Surf Tour visits Seaside Reef in Cardiff this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecast: According to Surfline/Wavetrak, surfers can expect fun waves in the 
head-high range beginning today.

DO IT!: SKIERS SAY TELEMARK, GET SET, GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who watched the ski-jumping competition in the Winter Olympics heard 
the term telemark a lot, in reference to the landings: one ski gliding in front 
of the other, adding stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Telemarking, named after a region in southern Norway, is a technique long-used 
among cross-country skiers, particularly in deep snow and other challenging 
backcountry conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works particularly well in conditions that are not ideal, the glop and 
slop that you sometimes get," said Dave Horine of Orange-based Pacific 
Wilderness Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the telemark is now moving beyond cross-country to the ski 
resorts, where more and more skiers are trying telemarking techniques on 
downhill slopes. Although it is still rare to find anyone telemarking on local 
ski runs, Horine says he frequently sees the technique when he skis resorts in 
Utah and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Wilderness Institute, which offers instruction in a variety of outdoor 
pursuits, will continue its current season of one-day introductory telemark 
courses Sunday. Other dates for "Telemark Skiing I" are March 12, 19 and 26. 
(Advanced classes are also offered). 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, classes have been a blend of cross-country and alpine 
enthusiasts, Horine said, and both are welcome. The cross-country skiers are 
looking to move to the next skill level; the alpine skiers are looking for a 
new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way telemarking is practiced today, it is truly a hybrid," Horine added. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics covered in the one-day workshop include body position and balance, turn 
initiation, steering and other basics. Classes are held at Big Bear-area ski 
resorts, where the twin luxuries of groomed snow and lift service allow more 
time to hone technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollees should have already mastered the gliding wedge (the "snowplow") 
before taking the class. Class size is small, usually about four students.  
</P>
<P>
 "I do it more for fun than anything else," Horine said. "It's just an excuse 
to go skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Telemark skiing workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, March 6, all day. Also, March 12, 19 and 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Call for meeting information. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $42, plus lift ticket ($30-$40).

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'FAMILY': A GRINNING, SOMETIMES SMIRKING LOOK AT EAST MEETS 
WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan-bashing may have been in vogue in Detroit and Washington during the 
'80s, but Japan- mania was more the attitude for the international film 
community that decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese movie-makers were on a roll, the cinematic equivalent of the revving 
Toyota and Honda companies. Akira Kurosawa was, as usual, at the forefront, but 
upstart directors such as Juzo Itami also struck with pictures such as 
"Tampopo" and "A Taxing Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Itami, Yoshimitsu Morita made an impact by exposing the radical shift in 
Japanese culture -- from a more traditional stance to a devoted love of 
everything American. Morita's "The Family Game," screening Friday night as the 
latest installment in UC Irvine's "Tragedy and Comedy" series, is a grinning, 
sometimes smirking, look at Westernization as it plays out in a seemingly 
conventional Japanese family. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 movie opens with a scene one critic described as "some dreadful, 
bourgeois parody of the Last Supper." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a long, narrow table are the members of Shigeyuki's family. He's 
the hero-narrator of Morita's comedy and he tells us right off that "everybody 
in my family is too much." 
</P>
<P>
 We can see that for ourselves. They furiously eat their food, jamming elbows 
into one another, reaching for bowls of rice, egg yolks and raw fish. As they 
slurp it all down, there's Shigeyuki (the deadpanning Ichirota Miyagawa), 
appearing bemused. 
</P>
<P>
 He's really at the center of Morita's movie, which follows his travails as a 
misunderstood teen-ager trying to cope with his cultures' expectations and all 
the mundane hassles that tend to follow high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound boringly typical, but Morita's screenplay (which was based on a 
novel by Yohei Honma) invigorates the subject matter by bringing in an 
arrogant, bed-hopping tutor (the glaring Yusaku Matsuda) to help him with his 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 There's comic friction between these two. The tutor is not a gentle sort; to 
encourage excellence from Shigeyuki, he says, "Study hard or I'll hit you. I 
don't mind blood, I watch the tube all day." In a more tender scene, he bends 
over Shigeyuki and coos, "You're cute. All those pimples -- the symbol of 
youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the interest we have in this odd relationship, Morita sways us with the 
cleverly composed images of Westernization. Students rush home to change out of 
traditional clothes and into American T-shirts and jeans. Shots of Japan's ugly 
industrialization, which, Morita implies, is a response to American business, 
is a little unsettling as we see the old being replaced by the modern. 
</P>
<P>
 How Shigeyuki's family fits into all this transition is key to understanding 
Morita's movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The director seems to be wondering if any Japanese family can withstand the 
shock of the new, when long-held beliefs give way to flashy, with-it-now 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Yoshimitsu Morita's "The Family Game." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, March 4, at 7 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The UC Irvine Student Center's Crystal Cove Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south 
to Campus Drive and take a left. Turn right on Bridge Road and take it into the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $2 to $4.

KIDS ON FILM: TWISTS IN 'GREEDY' MAKE FOR A GENEROUS PAYOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Greedy," a group of back-stabbing relatives, panicked that their 
manipulative old Uncle Joe (Kirk Douglas) is about to will his millions to a 
shapely live-in "nurse," seeks help from his long-lost favorite, Danny (Michael 
J. Fox), who then gets sucked into the family rivalry. (Rated PG-13) This being 
a sneak preview, hardly anyone knew what to expect, except that they were about 
to see a movie with Kirk Douglas and Michael J. Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, it was the ever-twisting and thickening plot that stole the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Uncle Joe playing mind games to see who really loved him? Was he really 
rich or was he really in debt? Was Danny trying to deceive him?  
</P>
<P>
 "They should have named it 'Deception,' " said Matt Khalil, 11. "I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some adults found the movie dragged some and the ending predictable. But even 
older kids said they were hugely surprised by the final plot twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good movie, better than I expected," said Heather Cohn, 19. 
"Normally, I fall asleep in movies, and I didn't fall asleep in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Cannon, 22: "I thought it was great. It was very hilarious. The 
whole plot was just excellent. Great twists. Very funny. The ending was just 
spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon, a fan of "Saturday Night Live," especially liked the performance of 
SNL regular Phil Hartman as one of the sleazier cousins who has no problem with 
trading all respect and dignity for his chance at a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the audience cheered when Hartman -- his perfect image shattered at a 
family dinner by his defiant teen-ager's "Make me!" retort -- actually picks up 
the boy and whisks him away to the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do the relatives cover up their own imperfections to gain Uncle Joe's 
favor, but they also hire private detectives to spy on one another to discredit 
their rivals for the inheritance. They undergo sex-selection fertilization to 
ensure they will produce male heirs. Those who don't name their girls with 
variations of Joe. They bring him $400 stuffed birds for his collection because 
"you have to spend money to make money."  
</P>
<P>
 To show up his relatives, Danny even performs his boyhood Jimmy Durante 
imitation Uncle Joe used to love. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Kawaguchi, 9, was impressed with a black-and-white clip of a Durante 
performance that introduces the movie. He didn't know who Durante was before 
the movie, and he didn't know afterward. But still, he was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who are concerned about language (and even those who usually are not) 
should be warned that a number of the laughs rely on colorful insults and 
swearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are concerned about sex or nudity should know that many of the other 
laughs rely on whether "Nurse" Molly will sleep with the frail, elderly Uncle 
Joe. We are also treated to the tattooed buns of Michael J. Fox, which some of 
us could live without. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Kenneth said he couldn't rank it with his all-time favorites. 
Given the choice, he said he'd probably put it in the other category of those 
"I might forget about tomorrow."

MEZZALUNA: GO FOR THE SCHMOOZE, STAY FOR THE FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Sunday evening at Mezzaluna, and the regulars have already assembled 
around the restaurant's L-shaped bar. A confident, attractively dressed Corona 
del Mar crowd sips moscato and grappa while nibbling on some of Orange County's 
most authentic Italian cooking and, more to the point, getting grandly 
schmoozed up in lilting Florentine-accented English by Romano Molfetta, 
arguably Orange County's most charming restaurateur. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no missing Molfetta; he's the rakishly handsome man behind the bar 
wearing a designer sweater, professorish spectacles and a tennis player's tan. 
Once upon a time he was an Alfa Romeo executive, but somehow he got into the 
food business along with friend and colleague Aldo Bozzi of the original 
Mezzaluna in New York City. (Neither of his Mezzalunas is related to the 
restaurants of the same name in Aspen and Beverly Hills.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though this Mezzaluna is open from late morning to the wee hours, I've 
never been here when Molfetta wasn't behind the bar. His wife, Pamela, is also 
a fixture, and together the two give this place a real neighborhood air, the 
sort that a good trattoria needs for survival in Italy. It's this fact, and not 
the chichi design or the delicious food, that explains Mezzaluna's lasting 
appeal. The air of familiarity makes Mezzaluna the most Italian of Orange 
County restaurants -- a ristorante integrale , integrated into the local scene, 
if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been easy, though. For its first few years the restaurant was 
struggling, in part perhaps because it is so resolutely Italian. Corona del Mar 
diners weren't taken with the restaurant's cracker-crust pizzas, chewy pastas 
or delicately flavored appetizers in the early days, nor were they totally 
comfortable eating fancy Italian dishes in what is really a fancied-up cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 But gradually, Molfetta's dogged charm, combined with Piedmontese chef Ugo 
Allesina's rustic cooking, won a steady following, and today the restaurant 
appears to be over the hump. There is likely to be a good crowd whenever you 
dine there now, and the air is often thick with conversation in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 The word mezzaluna , it should be mentioned, has two Italian translations: the 
crescent moon and a crescent-shaped kitchen chopper with two wooden handles. As 
a result of that double sense, the restaurant's walls are plastered with 
colorful interpretations of the waxing (or waning, if you are of the 
half-empty-cup school) moon done by various artists. The plates, the menu and 
other paraphernalia are decorated with a logo of the traditional chopper done 
in blue and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Open the black plastic menu cover (red if you come for lunch) and the first 
thing you see is a list of specials printed on bright red paper. This is where 
chef Allesina gets creative, even a touch outrageous. At the very top of the 
page is his tropical salad of shrimp, avocado, papaya and other ingredients -- 
something you'd expect to be served at a Mexican resort. When slightly ripe 
chunks of avocado meet slightly unripe chunks of papaya, the result is 
surprisingly pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find wonderful trattoria dishes like eggplant ravioli in a sauce of 
basil, tomato and goat cheese and orecchiette (ear-shaped noodles) with spicy 
sausage, rapini and tomato sauce. Allesina prepares a light, distinctly 
Japanese tuna carpaccio with watercress ( de rigueur in Corona del Mar, though 
scandalous to a red-blooded Italian), a crisp, nearly greaseless veal Milanese 
and a hearty, if pedestrian, chicken Parmigiana.  
</P>
<P>
 Neapolitan-style pizzas, cooked downstairs in a wood-burning oven, are listed 
on the menu's back page. I can't even think of coming here without ordering at 
least one pizza scamorza e radicchio, with smoked mozzarella, little pieces of 
broken radicchio and chunks of fresh tomato. The delicate smoke-flavored cheese 
plays off this crust like music, with the other components adding little grace 
notes of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza ai funghi (with mushrooms) is one you find all over Italy, the intense 
mushroom flavors somehow magnified by the oven's wood embers. There's even a 
traditional pizza Napoletana -- anchovy, capers, oregano -- even though Naples 
is a long, long way from Molfetta's home town of Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 The chef's lasagna verde alla Bolognese is rich and creamy, the bechamel sauce 
giving the green lasagna with meat sauce an effect as much French as Italian. 
Pappardelle ai funghi porcini -- wide, flat noodles with earthy porcini 
mushrooms -- have the richness of Allesina's own home region of Piedmont. 
Paglia e fieno (literally "straw and hay") is so named because it is composed 
of a mix of green and golden fettuccine, one made with spinach, the other with 
egg. Allesina serves them in a light tomato sauce with chicken, peas and 
broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
 I've also had a tasty version of capellini d'angelo here. The angel-hair pasta 
is served in a simple basil and garlic tomato sauce. It's big with the regulars 
at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 You can have piatti secondi such as seafood mixed grill or a sliced grilled 
steak similar to a Florentine beefsteak here, but main course dishes seem 
beside the point after the pizzas and pastas. The restaurant's light, ethereal 
desserts, though, make perfect sense. Take the coffee zabaglione. Zabaglione is 
essentially egg yolk and sugar whipped into a froth, and why more restaurants 
don't have the inspired idea to add a bit of coffee is beyond me. 
</P>
<P>
 For chocolate-lovers there's torta al cioccolato , sort of a bittersweet 
Italian fudge pie. Bavarese , otherwise known as Bavarian cream, is a molded 
dessert (here in the shape of a heart) fashioned out of gelatin, cream and 
fruit. Mezzaluna's is flavored with mango, served with a three-fruit coulis.  
</P>
<P>
 The heart shape is no coincidence, I'm guessing. This is one restaurant with a 
lot of heart, and if you don't believe me, belly up to the bar and see for 
yourself. Molfetta makes people feel like regulars in no time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezzaluna is high-end moderate. Antipasti are $3 to $12. Pizzas are $9 and 
$9.50. Pastas are $9.50 to $11. Main courses are $14 to $20.

PARKER'S PLACE: GIVING FREE REIN TO MALE IMAGE SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a lot of boys and men, I grew up much influenced by the more obvious 
forms of the "male image." 
</P>
<P>
 As a 6-year-old, I was constantly playing Army, lugging a plastic gun around 
the neighborhood, looking for fascists. A little later, I got a cowboy style 
"Fanner-Fifty" six-gun and holster, which I wore slung low, and practiced many 
hours at the quick draw and attendant deadly, squint-eyed stare. I was good. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there was the Steve Canyon jet helmet that turned me into a fighter 
pilot, a child's plastic bow and arrow set that transformed me into Cochise, a 
battalion of miniature plastic tanks that gave me a taste of Pattonhood, a 
large plastic knife that brought to mind Tarzan stabbing the alligator 
underwater (my brother played the gator), gladiator helmets and swords that 
returned me to the glory of ancient Rome, plastic Civil War weaponry that 
magically changed our suburban Tustin household into a tragic Shiloh of the 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a hero was mandatory, easy to do and affordable. More or less, it kept 
you out of trouble. None of the neighborhood parents, in those far-off days, 
worried that by buying their kid a toy six-gun, the kid would actually turn out 
to be a gunfighter, though I suspect that a lot of those boys would -- in their 
hearts of hearts -- rather be gunfighters than perform the dreary jobs they 
hold as adults. Who wouldn't? 
</P>
<P>
 As I reached high school, my male role models suddenly went from the imaginary 
to the real. What a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the days of Army and the Old West. Forgotten were the fury of 
Cochise, the trials of Hercules, the glum existential resolve of Sgt. Saunders 
on "Combat." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I was supposed to canonize the quarterback of the football team (a 
moron with a fair arm), and, well, what? Dream of the day when my skinny body, 
thin neck and wobbly knees would catapult me to stardom on the gridiron, in a 
patently boring game revolving around punts and real estate? Sure, there was 
Muhammad Ali, but I was too small, too weak, too white, and Sonny Liston 
terrified me. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of college and pop culture did little for my male image search. To 
play it straight and emulate my literary heroes, I would have had to become a 
dead genius, two criteria I had little chance of meeting as an undergrad with a 
healthy body and mediocre SAT scores. Anyway, Joyce was a great writer, but he 
had bad eyes and carried around his wife's underwear in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to the counterculture, I could certainly wear flannel shirts, grow my 
hair and affect a stoner's countenance but could never remember if "Heart of 
Gold" went C-F-G or F-C-D and, truly, I wasn't much drawn to being a miner 
anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 At some point, most adults realize that it's too time-consuming to live their 
lives while trying to be somebody else, too. But that burning desire to step 
into the hero's shoes never really goes away, which is what led me a few weeks 
ago to the Club riding school at Sycamore Trails Stables in San Juan 
Capistrano, determined to learn how to ride a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little time on my hands of late, I'd been keeping out a keen eye for an 
interesting frame in which to put myself, a fresh context, something 
challenging, something new, something . . . manly. Happily, I had been given 
two riding lessons as a birthday present by a good friend, one of the Club's 
apprentice instructors, Donna Shabdue. 
</P>
<P>
 I made the appointment, struggled into a pair of cowboy boots and drove out to 
Sycamore Trails. Heretofore, my experience with horses had been comprised of 
two events -- one unhappy and one tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 10-year-old on Grandma Mae's farm in Ohio, I'd mounted a barnyard pony 
that simply walked over to the fence and rubbed me off like I was a piece of 
chewing gum stuck to his side. As a 30-year-old, I watched a horse up in 
Mendocino County throw and trample to death its rider, a young girl named 
Julie. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, I was given Hudson. Hudson is 17-plus hands, 20-something-years-old 
and was saved from slaughter not long ago, then taken to Sycamore Trails and 
fattened up. His reputation is as a gentle and tolerant animal who can abide 
fools like me. At our introduction he regarded me with huge soulful eyes and an 
expression of uncensored distrust. I ran my hand down his neck, truly amazed at 
how strong this animal was. We brushed him down, saddled him up and led him to 
the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 My first idea, once on horseback, was wow, that's a long way down. I recalled 
Thomas McGuane's remark about how for a rider, after age 30, the ground just 
keeps getting farther away and harder. I kept hearing my wrist bone snap. I 
grabbed for the saddle horn, but there was none, Donna having decided I should 
begin English style. Hudson glanced back at me like a getaway driver looking 
for cops. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna regarded me with amusement and announced that I was about to "enter the 
Outer Limits," something about losing control of my seat, then proceeded to 
lead Hudson in a circle around her while I sat atop the brute. I asked her how 
many students got thrown this week and she said just one, from whom Donna had 
extracted 25 cents for the offense of falling. I offered her a tenner if she'd 
make sure I didn't. No deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Around me whizzed 10-year-old girls having fun, a concept that abandoned me 
the second Hudson began moving and Donna ordered me to sit up straight, put my 
hands on my hips and not look at the ground. "Look at the dirt, and that's 
where you're going," she said comfortingly. 
</P>
<P>
 I mastered the walk in a few minutes, not falling off. Next came the trot, for 
which I was allowed to hold onto these little cloth handles on the saddle pad, 
and pray. The seated trot went pretty well, but the other one -- the posting 
trot -- can be a bit punishing if you time the fall of your hips to coincide 
with the rise of the animal's back. One envisions the eunuch's options. 
</P>
<P>
 I was given the reins. For a few moments during the posting trot . . . the 
kind you do up on the irons, in rhythm with the horse . . . I got a taste of 
how a true horseman feels. I was tall in the saddle. I had a thousand and some 
odd pounds of horseflesh nominally under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Before me stretched not the parking lot of Sycamore Trails Stables and 
suburban Orange County, but the open prairie of the West, bad guys fleeing up 
ahead, my best friends galloping alongside and we're all dressed really 
bitchin' like in "The Long Riders," heading for a saloon staffed by corsetted 
ladies who will smile adoringly at us when we dismount and tie up to the 
hitchin' post, then allow us to drink whiskey, play poker and shoot card cheats 
until closing time. What a life! 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Hudson chose this moment to hit the brakes, rear and prepare to 
attack another horse that had come into his space. My Old West, male-image 
reverie was shrunk to the unheroic fact that I was only a nervous dope yanking 
the reins of poor spooked Hudson and holding on for dear life. He steered 
around the invader, and I got off as soon as I could, proud -- and thankful -- 
that I had survived. 
</P>
<P>
 I've yet to schedule lesson No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 I've given some thought lately to the idea of quitting while ahead. The 
thought has come that I'm too old for a career as a horseman, that perhaps I 
should just stick to the tasks at hand. I can write a paragraph, do the laundry 
or read a book as good as the next guy. But where's the fun in that? 
</P>
<P>
 Already I can feel the lure of trying it again, leaving the routine of the 
everyday behind and lighting out -- atop Hudson, boots a'glistenin' and dust 
flying in the wind of our gallop -- for the territory.

3-HOUR TOUR: AT TESSMANN PLANETARIUM, IT'S A STARRY, STARRY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, Anne Michaud is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When it's smoggy or overcast in Orange County, there is still a place you can 
see the night sky. In fact, you can see these "stars" during the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is the Tessmann Planetarium and Museum on the Santa Ana campus of 
Rancho Santiago College. The planetarium is so realistic that the stars appear 
to twinkle over silhouettes of the San Bernardino and Santa Ana mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3: The planetarium schedules tours by appointment on three weekday 
mornings. On Sunday afternoons, the public is invited to just drop in. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking lot in front of the planetarium says "30-minute parking," but you 
can ignore this sign on Sundays. One warning: Be prompt. You can't enter once 
the lights are dimmed and the show has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors pay an entry fee ($2 for adults, $1 for students and seniors) and are 
invited to sit along the cushioned benches that ring the room. The benches are 
designed with high backs so that an adult can rest his or her head and gaze 
heavenward comfortably during the hourlong show. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center of the planetarium is a large sphere. As the lights dim and the 
show begins, this sphere rises silently toward the ceiling. The sphere is 
pinpricked and lit from within so that the light creates a map of stars against 
the blackened dome. 
</P>
<P>
 The planetarium's creators have somehow managed to simulate the white 
intensity of the North Star and the orange shading of Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday shows are scripted and narrated by the Orange County Astronomers, a 
group of avid stargazers. The shows change regularly. In February, the group 
began an exploration of "Contact: The Search for Extraterrestrials." March's 
program is "Clusters of Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 By projecting slides against the dome's still-darkened inside, the astronomy 
club members tell their particular story of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they offer some general stargazing tips and lore about how the stars 
got their names. 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 3:15: After the show, stroll out behind the planetarium and take a look 
at the rocky water fountain. Though not large, it is pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 It is dedicated to a geology instructor, Thomas M. Hartnett, who "inspired 
students to learn about and care for the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, like most colleges, has kiosks where students and others post 
bulletins. If you are interested in a cheap room, salsa dance lessons or a 
benefit to raise money for Vietnamese refugees in Southeast Asia, check out the 
kiosks for details. 
</P>
<P>
 3:15 to 5: Less than three-quarters of a mile from campus is a pretty little 
park and access to the Santa Ana River bicycle path. 
</P>
<P>
 Alona Park runs along the river. If you enter at 21st Street, you will find 
the best spots for picnicking, complete with tables and outdoor grills. There 
is a basketball court, baseball diamond and swings and slides. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are more interested in the bicycle path, enter Alona Park at 19th 
Street. Follow the path that runs between the condominium building and the 
baseball diamond. Turn left, and you're there. 
</P>
<P>
 As concrete riverbeds go, this is one of the more scenic. The muddy water 
flows at some depth at this time of year. Wooden bridges, no longer in use, 
cross overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 As you travel beneath busy surface streets and a Kool cigarette billboard, the 
riverbed seems like a quiet hideaway. 1. Tessman Planetarium and Museum 
Building M100 Rancho Santiago College 1530 W. 17th St., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Tours by appointment at 9:30 a.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Drop-in tours 
at 2 p.m. on Sundays. (714) 564-6600. 
</P>

 2. Alona Park and Santa Ana River trail English and 19th streets, Santa Ana. 
</P>

HOSPITAL'S FATE DEBATED; VA MAY NOT REBUILD QUAKE-HIT SEPULVEDA COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the outside, the stately Sepulveda Veterans Administration hospital 
complex looks as though it weathered the Northridge earthquake fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
 Elderly veterans still stroll around its serene, campus-like grounds. Doctors, 
nurses and medical students bustle about the offices and clinics. All of its 
brick-faced buildings are still standing. 
</P>
<P>
 But walk inside some buildings and it is clear that the 39-year-old federal 
medical center sustained heavy damage in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The main hospital, Building 3, is uninhabitable, its corridors strewn with 
broken glass, damaged medical machinery and waterlogged chunks of ceiling. With 
dozens of pipes ruptured, there is no water service. The boiler room is 
unusable, depriving the hospital of heat. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, most of the 331 patients evacuated on the day of the quake remain 
scattered among other VA hospitals in West Los Angeles, Long Beach and Loma 
Linda. So extensive is the damage that Congress recently appropriated $43.6 
million just to clean up Sepulveda and reconnect its utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But with that work under way, questions are being raised about the future of 
the hospital, which employs more than 1,700 people and has long been a center 
for research in geriatrics and training of medical interns and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials in Washington are quietly discussing whether to rebuild the 
431-bed facility, at a cost of $188 million, or convert it into an outpatient 
care center. Conversion would carry a far smaller price tag of $119 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has been joined by private hospitals in Los Angeles, which argue 
that given the thousands of empty hospital beds in the region, Sepulveda should 
not be rebuilt if its patients can be permanently absorbed at other VA 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans themselves, perhaps the most vocal and influential group in the 
controversy, are split on the issue. Some favor reconstruction while others say 
the hospital should change its focus from inpatient care to less expensive 
outpatient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some veterans argue that the VA should take advantage of the quake 
damage to transform Sepulveda -- as well as other hospitals in the nation's 
largest medical system -- into a model of health care reform, keeping in step 
with the Clinton Administration's initiatives.  
</P>
<P>
 For six years, Sepulveda has been the site of a pilot outpatient program that 
proponents say could be extended to the entire, 172-hospital VA system. They 
argue that outpatient care makes more sense as the agency's budget shrinks and 
the veterans' population ages, creating a need for more long-term-care beds and 
fewer acute-care beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clinic services have reopened at Sepulveda, but Building 3 has been 
vacant since Jan. 17, when terrified patients were hurriedly evacuated by a 
small cadre of nurses and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gripping their mattresses, bedridden veterans were half-carried, half-dragged 
down several flights of darkened stairs as aftershocks swayed the six-story 
building and water from broken pipes cascaded into hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the shaking stopped, Building 3's three wings had split away from 
its core, as they were designed to. Rooftop heating and cooling machinery was 
wrecked. Operating rooms were littered with water-logged equipment, packages of 
anesthesia masks and tubes of bone cement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how, when or if we're going to be salvaging millions of dollars 
of equipment," said the hospital's chief engineer, Ed Safdie, during a recent 
inspection of Building 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the damage to Building 3 and its equipment was caused by flooding from 
broken water pipes. With maintenance workers initially preoccupied with helping 
get patients out of the building, the sprinkler system was not turned off until 
more than five hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also caused extensive damage by knocking computers, expensive 
medical machinery and other equipment to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Safdie said the VA appropriated $500,000 for internal bracing and anchoring of 
equipment at Sepulveda two years ago. But that money was diverted for 
additional waterproofing at the hospital after severe flooding hit the Valley 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A VA spokeswoman in Washington said "a number of buildings" at Sepulveda are 
likely to be retrofitted against earthquakes, but she didn't know what specific 
work would be done or how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1955, the Sepulveda VA is also a teaching hospital affiliated with 
medical schools at UCLA and numerous other universities. Last year, 364 medical 
residents and interns trained at Sepulveda. The hospital's budget this year is 
$112 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda conducts research on aging, drug and alcohol abuse, neurological 
disorders, heart disease and other problems. In 1993, more than $8 million was 
spent on research. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, Sepulveda was edging away from traditional inpatient 
care under a pilot program known as PACE, or Pilot Ambulatory Care and 
Education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in 1988, the program uses teams of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and 
psychiatrists to treat veterans in an outpatient setting. It emphasizes 
preventive health care and is seen as a potential money-saving alternative to 
long-term hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The program survived the quake. But what to do with the hospital -- given the 
amount of damage -- is being debated from Los Angeles to Washington within the 
VA, Congress and veterans' groups. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent briefing in Washington for members of Congress from 
California, VA officials outlined the pluses and minuses of renovating the 
hospital or turning it into an outpatient center. Under either option, the 
hospital's 145-bed nursing home would remain.

SCHOOL PROBE YIELDS LITTLE IN 5 WEEKS; INVESTIGATION: POLICE REPORT 'NO MAJOR 
REVELATIONS' ON ABUSE CHARGES. PARENTS AND FACULTY OF PRIVATE FACILITY IN SOUTH 
PASADENA SAY THE INQUIRY IS TAKING TOO LONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An investigation into allegations of misconduct by staff members at a small 
private school in South Pasadena has uncovered "no major revelations" of abuse, 
although the inquiry will not be finished until the end of this week, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there haven't been any significant developments," said South 
Pasadena Police Chief Thomas E. Mahoney. "No one thing has led us to something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney said it was too early to know if any of the 11 staff members at 
Stancliff School could face criminal prosecution, but none have been arrested 
and the school has remained open since police launched the investigation five 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know what the district attorney will do until we submit our 
report," he said. "(But) there has been no development so far that we were not 
perhaps expecting." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials and parents, many of whom have complained that the inquiry is 
taking too long, said they look forward to its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We parents have been putting a great deal of pressure on them to wrap this up 
and either make a decision (to press charges) or not," said Mary Smart, who has 
two daughters at the school. "They need to squelch the rumor mill and undo the 
damage they have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Since serving a search warrant and confiscating files and computer disks on 
the afternoon of Jan. 27, authorities have remained tight-lipped about the 
nature of the allegations, saying only that the inquiry involved multiple 
victims and suspects. Mahoney said Wednesday the investigation has focused on 
disciplinary measures at the 132-student school, which has a small campus on 
Arroyo Verde Road for kindergarten through eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary reason we went there was because we were concerned with the way 
disciplinary measures were applied to children at the school," he said. "It was 
relative to discipline and corporal punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Judith Thayer said Wednesday that the school has not used corporal 
punishment for about eight years, dropping the use of wooden paddles "because 
the times have changed." The school does require some unruly students to 
perform physical exercises as punishment, she said, including pushups and 
running laps around the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and school officials said investigators have been asking about two 
incidents involving Andrew Thayer, who is the principal's son and the school's 
physical education teacher and football coach. In one incident, Andrew Thayer 
and several students apparently placed a football player in a trash dumpster, 
and in another, Andrew Thayer placed a boy's feet and lower legs in an ice 
machine.  
</P>
<P>
 Judith Thayer said both of the incidents were meant in fun, one following a 
football victory and the other on a hot summer day. She said neither incident 
was intended as a form of discipline. Thayer said her son has temporarily 
stopped working at the school since the investigation began because "he has 
been overwhelmed by all of this."

REPAIRS MAY CUT SEATING AT COLISEUM; RECOVERY: PROJECT MANAGER SAYS WORK COULD 
LAST INTO DECEMBER. STADIUM'S CAPACITY MIGHT BE REDUCED TO 50,000 DURING EARLY 
PART OF FOOTBALL SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Coliseum's project manager said Wednesday that all earthquake 
repair work may not be complete until December, and the stadium capacity for 
next fall's football games could be as low as 50,000 while repairs continue at 
upper levels. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Don C. Webb sketched out the possibility that 1994 spectators 
might not have escalators to get to their seats or a full array of concessions, 
due to the need to construct new reinforcing beams for the outer wall, the 
contractor who will do the project was more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Tutor, president of Tutor-Saliba Corp., declared outside a Coliseum 
Commission meeting, "If we don't open the stadium with significant capacity by 
September, I'm leaving town on an extended tour of Europe, because I won't be 
able to face my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum's capacity last season was 67,802 for Raider games and as high as 
94,000 for big USC games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor said he is prepared to work virtually around the clock on a project that 
Coliseum commissioners were told will entail demolition and rebuilding of the 
entire interior passage at the upper concourse level, as well as substantial 
compacting of the earthen berm underlying the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, meanwhile, told commissioners he is increasing his previous estimate of 
the cost of repairs from $33 million to $34.7 million, and said the figure 
could go higher, especially if a number of concession facilities must be 
rebuilt when the beams are in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum Commission gave its approval for a $1.08 million contract for 
Webb and a staff of six to manage the project, and a contract of indeterminate 
cost for Tutor-Saliba to perform the work, with a provision for a 3.5% margin 
for overhead and profit. Commissioners said the cost of the work will be filled 
in when the precise figures are available, with the funds coming from federal 
and state disaster funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting last month under an emergency proclamation, the commission decided to 
award the contracts without bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, however, the commission's president, Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke; the vice president, Los Angeles City Council President 
John Ferraro, and contractor Tutor gave assurances to Danny Bakewell, head of 
the Brotherhood Crusade, and other black community representatives that 
minority subcontractors will receive a share of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before the commission, both architect Terry Miller of the HNTB firm 
and structural engineer Nabib Youssef said they have zeroed in on more reliable 
estimates of the earthquake damage to the Coliseum, and have substantially 
settled on the reconstruction that will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 They said this can be done without dramatic alteration of the stadium's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Webb announced that an agreement has been reached by the Los 
Angeles Conservancy, a preservationist group, and the California Office of 
Historic Preservation, allowing necessary temporary demolitions to proceed, 
exposing the damaged elements and facilitating the repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said it is possible that work on interior beams to support the outer 
wall, repairs on the peristyle end and rebuilding of the escalators and 
concessions will still be continuing when the football season begins. He said 
he had informed the Raiders of this, but that team officials had no immediate 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor called the prospect of such substantial ongoing construction next fall a 
"worst case scenario."

WESTSIDE REPAIRS ADD TO DRIVERS' POST-QUAKE TORMENTS; ROADS: MANY ASK WHY 
ROBERTSON BOULEVARD WORK COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL REOPENING OF FREEWAY. OFFICIALS 
SAY DELAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's one thing for traffic to grind to a halt because of an act of God. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a whole different story, insist aggravated motorists, when city 
bureaucrats barricade portions of post-earthquake freeway detours and alternate 
routes in order to undertake unrelated road and drainage repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the case on the Westside near Beverly Center, where bedeviled drivers 
are fuming about a pair of long-planned projects that have added a new layer of 
frustration to an already hellish commute. 
</P>
<P>
 The coup de grace for some commuters occurred this week when Robertson 
Boulevard was closed to through traffic at Burton Way for 17 days in order to 
help complete a $1.35-million storm drain and road repair contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very simple thing," said importer Peter Foster, while stuck for more 
than 10 minutes along a three-block stretch of Burton Way late Tuesday 
afternoon. "They shouldn't try to repair roads right now when it's not 
absolutely necessary. They should concentrate on the freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 Why couldn't such work be postponed until the Santa Monica Freeway is back in 
one piece? 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials argue that delays would cost the city untold thousands of 
dollars in added costs charged by the private contractor installing 3,500 feet 
of concrete storm drains under Burton Way. Moreover, contends City Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky, the pain is only relative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a problem no matter when we do it, with or without the 
earthquake," said Yaroslavsky, who gave the go-ahead to the project, which is 
in his council district. "It won't be easy. (But) people need to take a bullet, 
shove it between their teeth and bite hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said the drainage work has been needed for many years because 
water collects along the roadway after rainstorms and even after owners of 
adjacent apartment buildings water their lawns. Burton Way itself has been "one 
of the worst streets in the entire city for many years. It has been 
disintegrating and is in desperate need of reconstruction," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a contract with Excel Paving Co. of Long Beach was signed last year, 
the work did not begin until several days after the Jan. 17 temblor. Still, 
that was no reason to turn back, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, I'm one of these guys who believes once the Novocain 
is in your system and you find out you need three fillings rather than two, you 
go ahead and get it over with when you're already in the chair," he said. 
"Usually, your councilman is there to make you feel good. But once in a while, 
you elect a councilman to do what's in your best interest even if it doesn't 
appear to be at first blush. This is one such case." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Yaroslavsky has his share of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Mercedes, BMW and Jaguar that came down Robertson from the hills 
scratched their bottoms because of the huge potholes," noted a sales associate 
at an antique shop near the epicenter of the roadwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it myself in my Ford only once," she hastened to add, "because my car 
is so small it fits between the potholes." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some motorists, stuck in a maze of orange and white road barriers, 
sounded as if they were capable of rearranging the councilman's face, if not 
the car bumpers of more genteel motorists in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wrong, it's ridiculous," shouted a Bulgarian emigre, who said the 
chaotic situation reminded him of public works projects in his native land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it sucks, because of the freeway," another anguished driver said. 
</P>
<P>
 As road crews completed their work day late Tuesday, there were no traffic 
officers on hand to assist motorists befuddled by the detour signs or to 
monitor the moves of the angrier drivers, and the thoroughfare turned into a 
sea of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver who identified herself as pop singer Anita O'Day sounded much like 
the character in the old Kingston Trio song who couldn't find his way off the 
Boston subway system. "There's just no place to go. How do I make a left?" she 
complained as she neared the Robertson intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around two times already, maybe," echoed Russian immigrant Boris 
Mosenzhnik, who works as a mechanical engineer for the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. "The nighttime is the best time to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burton Way project, due to be completed in early summer, is one of several 
road repair bottlenecks between the Westside and Downtown Los Angeles these 
days. Among them are projects on Third Street east of La Cienega Boulevard and 
on Beverly Boulevard west of Vermont Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Burton/Robertson intersection is far north of the Santa Monica 
Freeway, Burton and other roads nearby are often used as alternatives to the 
closed freeway, and Robertson, to the south, is a major freeway detour route. 
</P>
<P>
 Project engineer Ken Wang of the city Bureau of Engineering said there was 
little choice but to temporarily close all but one lane eastbound and westbound 
on Burton and to fully barricade the north-south intersection, where more than 
1,500 cars an hour pass during peak periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a bulldozer and a hauling truck for removal," Wang said. "The 
equipment takes up most of the street. There is no room to keep it open, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City transportation engineering associate Randy Tanijiri said his department 
had recommended against closing the intersection, but that safety 
considerations won out. "In terms of building the project versus traffic, the 
council office decided they wanted the project built and in a safe manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of delay is difficult to pinpoint because there is no specific clause 
in the public works contract concerning city-instigated delays, said Stan Sysak 
of the Bureau of Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 But any delay would result in a "substantial" cost, according to Victor 
Hernandez of Excel Paving. "Nowadays, contractors, all they do is sue to get 
their money," said Wang. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, for his part, says that "any intelligent commuter on the Westside 
knows not to take Robertson all the way up to Burton or Beverly unless they 
have business there." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we'll live through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Such words were of little consolation to Beverly Hills Cab Co. driver Serof 
Abedian, as he sat stuck, fare-less, in traffic. "This is a very, very busy 
street," he muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable." Trouble Spot Robertson Boulevard is closed to through 
traffic at Burton Way in order to complete a $1.35 million storm drain and road 
improvement project. Traffic on Robertson in both directions must turn right on 
Burton Way. The project intensifies already clogged traffic on Westside streets 
used as alternatives to the Santa Monica Freeway, severly damaged in the 
Northridge earthquake.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SNOWPACK 
LEVEL TRIGGERS 9% WATER RATE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's primary source of water, the snowpack in the High Sierra, is not 
high enough to meet the demand of Los Angeles residents, meaning rates will 
increase 9% next month to pay for additional water, officials at the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The snowpack is about two-thirds of normal levels, triggering an automatic 
rate increase, officials said. The new rate takes effect April 1 and will add 
about $3.60 to the average family's bimonthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional revenue will be used to purchase water from the Metropolitan 
Water District. The new rate may be lowered by summer if snow levels increase, 
officials said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RLA STAFF CUT BY NEARLY 
HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RLA's new chief executive, Linda Griego, has cut the riot-recovery agency's 
paid staff nearly in half to 15 people in order to keep RLA afloat until 1997, 
when it is scheduled to go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego, who was named less than three weeks ago to head the day-to-day 
management of the nonprofit agency, said the restructuring will help her and 
new RLA Board Chairman Lodwrick Cook run a more streamlined operation, 
concentrating on aiding small and medium-sized businesses in impoverished 
neighborhoods to expand and create new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 To assist the effort, Griego said she hopes to open satellite offices in 
southern Los Angeles, Pacoima and in southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the employees terminated this week were chief financial officer Ed Smith 
and business development project manager Joel K. Rubenstein, the two remaining 
RLA staffers with direct links to initial RLA head Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no choice but to downsize -- the survival of the organization depended 
on it," said Griego, who added that she was also loosening the organization's 
ties to a small business lending agency created last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With RLA's decidedly mixed record of accomplishment, Griego said she could not 
base her budget on the possibility of receiving additional private 
contributions. "We have to show some momentum before we can count on that," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA, initially formed at former Mayor Tom Bradley's behest as the city's main 
response to the 1992 riots, will have a much reduced mission under one-time 
mayoral candidate Griego, who earns $150,000 a year in her new post. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the remaining seven-person economic development executive staff will 
take a "bottoms-up" approach to identifying businesses that need help 
expanding. The staff will also attempt to start business consortiums made up of 
small firms that manufacture medical equipment, auto parts, textiles and 
electronics. PAUL FELDMAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TRAPPED CAT FOUND 41 
DAYS (AND 8 LIVES) AFTER QUAKE 
</P>

<P>
 Tiffany the cat may be well on her way to becoming the poster puss of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 While she rested comfortably in her cage at a veterinary clinic in Saugus on 
Wednesday, having survived a six-week ordeal that might have taken a greater 
toll on a lesser cat with fewer lives to spare, clinic workers dealt with the 
media clamoring to capture the saga. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany, like many cats, bolted for cover when the ground moved under her paws 
Jan. 17. But Tiffany fled into a neighbor's storage closet and was later 
accidentally locked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's owner, Laurie Booth, searched for her cat, not knowing the feline 
was only feet away. Booth posted signs, quizzed neighbors and took out 
newspaper ads asking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday -- 41 days after the earthquake -- the neighbors found the cat when 
they went into the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany was dehydrated, starving and barely conscious. She had survived on no 
food, little water and a lot of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an amazing cat. She used up about eight of her nine lives on this one," 
said veterinarian Sandy Sanford, who is treating the cat at the Animal Clinic 
of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe she's still alive," said Booth, of Saugus. "She was 
like a piece of tissue paper -- frail and stiff and very cold." 
</P>
<P>
 "She just barely made it," said veterinarian John Burkhartsmeyer, who owns the 
clinic. "I don't think she would have made it much longer. She just had to live 
on her fat and protein. Bones and skin is all that's left." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth's thinking of a name change: "Lucky." REBECCA BRYANT

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
APPROVES SENIOR CITIZENS HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council gave its blessing Wednesday to a proposed senior 
citizens housing project along the Venice boardwalk that has been the focus of 
debate for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous council vote ended a 14-year debate raging in the seaside 
community over how to develop the project's four lots in the 100 block of Ocean 
Front Walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourteen years is long enough," said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who 
represents Venice. "It's time to get this housing built."  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Safran, a developer of low-income housing, will build a 25,000- 
square-foot, 64-unit apartment building adjacent to an existing senior citizens 
center. The council approved various permits and variances for the project, but 
Saffran still needs approval of rezoning from commercial to residential use.  
</P>
<P>
 He also must work out arrangements for construction subsidies from the Housing 
Department and the Community Redevelopment Agency. The project also will 
benefit from federal tax credits, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
AUDITORS SUGGEST WAYS TO CLOSE MTA BUDGET GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To close a massive budget shortfall next year, the county transit authority 
must consider reducing bus service, cutting some superfluous administrative 
positions and slashing salaries and benefits of thousands of employees, a team 
of independent auditors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A report presented to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority recommended 
that the agency eliminate bus routes that run parallel with trolley and subway 
services and cut back service on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Management should also endeavor to bring down labor costs as it enters into 
negotiations with the authority's biggest unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no harmless or painless means of reducing the MTA's expenses," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Many require changes either in fundamental policies and philosophies, 
or in the collective bargaining agreements that bear on the bus operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, compiled after a five-week study, comes as the MTA begins to 
grapple with the specter of a $126-million operating deficit in the coming 
fiscal year -- about 20% of the entire operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit did not address fare increases, but MTA officials are studying the 
possibility.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CERRITOS; 
SUPERINTENDENT LUCAS PUT ON INDEFINITE PAID LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ABC Unified District School Board has put embattled Supt. Larry L. Lucas 
on paid leave indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Cecy Groom offered no explanation for the move Tuesday night 
and the superintendent left the district's headquarters before the announcement 
was made.Board members then named Deputy Supt. Ira Toibin to replace Lucas 
until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas has headed the district since 1988. In July, the school board voted to 
extend his contract another year, to June, 1997, and to increase his pay by 
about $1,000, to $109,168. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently Lucas has clashed with a new majority, backed by the teachers 
union, that gained control of the school board in November after an 11-day 
teachers strike. Some board members had asked Lucas privately to leave about a 
month ago but he refused, his attorney, David C. Larsen, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district serves Cerritos, Artesia and Hawaiian Gardens, and parts of 
Lakewood, Norwalk and La Palma.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 3 INDICTED 
IN ALLEGED FRAUD SCHEME AIMED AT LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Los Angeles men who allegedly bilked 4,000 Latino investors from 
Southern California out of $10 million were indicted on federal mail fraud 
charges, a prosecutor said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Fadel, 30, Epigmenio Sandoval, 37, and Jose Castellanos, 35, were 
indicted on 18 counts each of mail fraud.Fadel also was charged with three 
counts of money laundering.  
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Ellyn Lindsay said the men, through the Fadel Group 
Investment Corp., solicited investors via Spanish-language radio and television 
stations, and through newspaper ads.  
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, Lindsay alleged, persuaded the investors to place their money 
with the Fadel group by promising rates of return of up to 24%. In exchange, 
the prosecutor alleged, Fadel, Sandoval and Castellanos promised to provide 
gems and property as a security. Instead, he said, the three men spent the 
money on themselves, giving out only gems and land deeds that were virtually 
worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Fadel faces up to 150 years behind bars and $6 million in fines. 
Sandoval and Castellanos face up to 90 years incarceration and $4.5 million in 
fines apiece.

SLIGHT JOB LOSS FROM QUAKE IS PREDICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A multibillion-dollar infusion of government earthquake relief and private 
insurance funds will fuel a temporary employment surge in the Los Angeles area, 
but the construction boomlet will soon wither, giving way to a small long-term 
job loss, according to a report Wednesday to the state Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most detailed analysis yet of the effects of the devastating Northridge 
earthquake on employment rates, researchers with UCLA's Business Forecasting 
Project estimated a loss of 29,300 jobs in Los Angeles County and 35,700 in the 
state during the first quarter of this year as a result of the Jan. 17 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 By the third quarter, reconstruction financed by about $14.4 billion in 
federal and state assistance and insurance payments will reverse the employment 
losses, creating 36,000 more jobs in Los Angeles County and 45,500 more in the 
state than would exist had the 6.8-magnitude quake not occurred, according to 
the UCLA report. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1996, however, "the stimulative effects of the earthquake will 
disappear," and Los Angeles County will have 12,600 fewer jobs, and the state 
18,500 fewer, than if there had been no quake, the forecast said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the quake by itself will not prompt business owners to shun 
Southern California. But while the quake "mainly reminds those making location 
decisions of seismic risks that were well known before, it still reinforces 
negative images of other disasters," including wildfires, riots and floods, 
analysts told the seismic safety panel at its meeting in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the long-term job losses are small when measured against the state's 
roughly 12 million workers and the huge cutbacks already felt in defense and 
aerospace employment, said Larry J. Kimbell, director of the Business 
Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbell noted that the state in recent years has lost about 150,000 defense 
jobs, and is expected to lose another 80,000 -- "10 times any permanent loss we 
would expect from the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Southern California is already in its worst recession since the 
Great Depression -- and that property values suffered their greatest decline 
since the 1920s even before the earthquake -- Kimbell described quake-related 
job losses as "a small-scale event." 
</P>
<P>
 Economically, "we've already had our 8.3," remarked his colleague Nancy 
Bolton, a senior demographer with the Business Forecasting Project, referring 
to predictions of the Big One, a quake of that magnitude occurring some day on 
the San Andreas Fault.  
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from members of the seismic safety panel, Kimbell 
acknowledged that such a giant quake would have profound economic effects. 
Whereas the Northridge quake will absorb about $1.9 billion in state relief 
funds, cleanup from the Big One could consume "half of the state budget -- $25 
billion," Kimbell said. LOS ANGEL

SCOTT HARRIS: A LETTER FROM 'EXHIBIT A' IN '3 STRIKES' DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Got another letter from my pen pal the other day. That's pen as in ballpoint 
and pen as in penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Simpson recognized the pun before I did. Now it's truer than ever 
because Simpson, a thrice-convicted felon, has been transferred from jail to 
state prison. When I first wrote about Simpson in January, he was facing a 
17-year sentence. As it turned out, he accepted a plea bargain with a 12-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, Simpson reports from Wasco State Prison, I've landed on my feet, 
ever the wily convict, yet an anomaly amongst the 'peckerwoods' (white 
inmates): a college man, well-spoken, articulate, clean-cut & shaven, no 
'tacks' (tattoos.) This generally works to my advantage, this professorial 
aspect, but can backfire (there are times to be a "wood," when a high-falutin' 
vocab. isn't appreciated.)  
</P>
<P>
 Brian's letters always make me leery. You have to worry about a con. That's 
con as in convict and con as in con job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as California contemplates building 20 more prisons and committing $2 
billion a year to operate them, Simpson is a decent Exhibit A in the unpopular 
case against "three strikes and you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you are disappointed that Simpson, 40, won't be spending the rest of 
his days in prison, as he would if the best-known "three strikes" proposal were 
now law. If he lived to the age of 80, that would cost us $1 million to house a 
man who is not prone to violence and might actually join the ranks of 
law-abiding taxpayers if he could kick his craving for crystal methamphetamine. 
(The defense will stipulate that during his last residential burglary, Simpson 
did swing a Christmas stocking loaded with a metal box when he was surprised by 
a boarder who happened to be a highway patrolman.) 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson may have targeted elderly victims in his burglaries but he didn't 
leave a trail of blood. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this criminal 
is that he had a middle-class upbringing and was attending UCLA when he 
spiraled into drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 This waste of opportunity may be all the more reason to regard Simpson with 
contempt. But as California moves toward passage of some version of "three 
strikes," the relevant question is whether Simpson's punishment fits his 
crimes. Under California's current laws, Simpson may be eligible for parole 
after six years if he behaves. So is six to 12 years enough for a three-time 
loser like Simpson? Or, as the "three strikes" initiative proposes, should such 
a felon be put away forever? 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of crime and outrage over the failures of the criminal justice system -- 
illustrated by the reckless handling of Richard Alan Davis, the accused killer 
of Polly Klaas -- have fueled the demand for extreme sentences and has 
politicians trying to look tough. Gov. Pete Wilson and his Democratic 
gubernatorial opponents have endorsed the harshest "three strikes" proposal. 
The National Rifle Assn. touts it as an alternative to gun control. The prison 
guard union, naturally, loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing wisdom in Sacramento, then, is that a creep is a creep is a 
creep. There is no distinction between the sicko who kidnaps, rapes and kills 
children and a petty thief armed with a Christmas stocking. All are beyond 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, politicians closer to the trenches, such as Sheriff Sherman 
Block and Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, oppose this measure. Assemblyman Richard K. 
Rainey (R-Walnut), a former sheriff, has offered perhaps the best alternative 
to the "three strikes" bill -- one that would impose life imprisonment for a 
third violent felony, or a third serious felony if the first two were violent. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief argument against "three strikes" is its expense, which would divert 
money from education, drug rehab programs, police and prosecutors. For years, 
California has spent more and more to put people in prison and less and less to 
educate children. Fifteen years ago, California was one of the top states in 
spending per student. Now it is near the bottom. More prisons haven't 
discouraged crime but, it seems, weaker schools have encouraged it. Troubled 
schools, the deterioration of family life, easy access to guns -- all have 
fueled the ugliness in youth crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Other arguments deal with practical effects. Doesn't the prospect of life 
imprisonment give felons incentive to murder witnesses? Garcetti, moreover, 
predicts a "tremendous jury backlash. Jurors are going to require more proof 
than 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti should know. His office is prosecuting the Menendez boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral argument against "three strikes" is one that no one wants to hear. 
People like Simpson's wife, Christine, and his father, Bob, a retired school 
principal, say Brian has let them down in the past, but they believe he may yet 
redeem himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, with credit for a year spent in jail, should be out in 1999. He might 
screw up again. But maybe he won't.

'I CAN NOW HAVE HOPE . . .'; PRIVATE GRANT TURNS LACKLUSTER SCHOOL IN CUDAHY 
INTO MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A grand education experiment was formally launched Tuesday at Elizabeth Street 
School in the tiny working class city of Cudahy, where teachers, parents and 
staff have received a $3.5-million private grant to turn their urban school 
into a national model for scholastic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Since receiving one of nine coveted national grants from a business-funded 
organization called the New American School Development Corp., Elizabeth Street 
School has been transformed from a lackluster elementary campus into bustling 
clusters of classrooms where students carry out assignments on state-of-the-art 
computers and video equipment and teachers strive to present classes in 
relevant themes, such as civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff has been involved in intense year-round training courses to update 
their own teaching and computer skills. The school, which has been converted to 
a kindergarten through 12th grade campus to better track student progress, also 
serves as a community link for health and social services. The entire school 
community -- parents, teacher, administrators -- are in the midst of creating a 
shared decision-making council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This learning center has showed me that there is hope for an American society 
that believes enough in teachers to invest in their professional growth," said 
eighth-grade English teacher Edwardo Munoz. "Every day I have responsibility 
for a hundred 13 and 14 year olds. I can now have hope for them." 
</P>
<P>
 As the school unfolds its plan to graduate students "who meet world class 
standards of scholarship and technology use," local educators intend to hold 
the school up as an example of how targeted resources and collaboration among 
teachers and administrators can prepare urban youths for the working world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elizabeth Street School model will be expanded later this year to another 
Los Angeles Unified School District campus, Foshay Middle School in 
South-Central Los Angeles. The projects have been dubbed the Los Angeles 
Learning Centers. The Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a business-backed 
education reform group, United Teachers-Los Angeles and the school district 
have worked together to create the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The curriculum will emphasize in-depth, thematic teaching that cuts across 
various subjects and attempts to provide real-world applications of the 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, for instance, a group of eighth-graders were assigned to produce 
a video presentation of the opening ceremony. While they had fun running the 
camera, their English teacher will be closely monitoring the written text and 
critiquing their spoken language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, these two schools have resources that other cash-crimped Los Angeles 
campuses can only dream of. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the giant school district, successful pilots have been launched for 
programs ranging from bilingual education to science instruction, but typically 
the models are not replicated at other schools because funding quickly dries 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help show how reform can be done," said Supt. Sid Thompson. "But 
other schools can't just go back and do it without resources." 
</P>
<P>
 The Learning Center grant has enabled the schools to spend nearly $1.3 million 
for computers so that students have laser disks and other components to make 
classroom lessons come alive on screen. About $585,000 has been spent on 
teacher training so that classrooms can change from static lecture halls into 
working teams of students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the infusion of money was needed to radically alter school operations, 
the idea behind the project is to set up a structure that can be 
self-supporting and incorporated in the schools' normal budget when the grant 
money runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The schools are in the process of setting up rigorous student assessment plans 
so that performance can be continually monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said a critical component for district-wide school reform will be 
finding resources for teacher training so that instructors can learn new ways 
to meet the needs of the city's diverse student population, many of whom are 
poor and speak little English. Computers, high-tech equipment and challenging 
lesson plans are useless unless teachers understand how it all works in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has currently adopted its own blueprint for reform called LEARN, 
which gives schools the freedom to control their own budgets and devise their 
own education programs. Thompson said the district must now find $4 to $6 
million to pay for staff training to launch the second phase of plan this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Street School Principal John Kershaw said that their gates will be 
open to educators and parents to evaluate components of their school programs 
for use at other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not realistic to think every school can get this kind of money," Kershaw 
said. "But as local schools get control of their own money, they can begin to 
use components of our plan."

OFFICERS IN GUNPLAY CASE CHARGED WITH FELONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The district attorney's office -- rejecting a contention by two Los Angeles 
police officers that they were not firing at a highway patrolman during a 
freeway shooting incident last month -- filed felony charges against them on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Ted S. Teyechea and Michael V. Herrera are scheduled for arraignment 
today on two counts each of assaulting a peace officer and shooting from a 
moving pickup truck at Scott Wall, a California Highway Patrol motorcycle 
officer who was parked on an on-ramp shoulder issuing a traffic ticket.Wall was 
not injured.  
</P>
<P>
 Teyechea and Herrera also were charged with firing with gross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all counts, the officers face maximum sentences of about 14 
years. They are free on $5,000 bail apiece and have been ordered to stay at 
home during their regular duty hours, said Lt. John Dunkin, a spokesman for the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD is conducting an administrative investigation and may "in the next 
few days" relieve them of duty without pay, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Herrera nor his lawyer could be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Levin, who represents Teyechea, said his client has been "grossly 
overcharged" in an attempt by prosecutors to get him to plead guilty to lesser 
offenses. "That is not going to happen," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred Feb. 9 near an on-ramp at the intersections of the 
Harbor and Redondo Beach freeways. The two LAPD officers had left their jobs 
and gone on a drinking spree, authorities say. Friends have said Herrera and 
Teyechea were shooting at street signs.

TRIAD HOSPITAL LOAN DEFAULT SPURS REFORM BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motivated by what he termed the "Triad hospital loan disaster," Assemblyman 
Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) has introduced legislation that would bar state 
employees and appointees from representing clients before their agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, introduced the bill 
following a committee hearing last week on the process by which Triad 
Healthcare Inc. of Encino obtained a $167-million loan guarantee from the 
state's Cal-Mortgage program -- the largest in the 25-year-old program's 
history. Triad defaulted last July, forcing state officials to suspend the 
program, which has helped many health care institutions qualify for 
low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was triggered by a Times investigation last December, which found 
that Triad's loan guarantee was approved over the objections of a Cal-Mortgage 
staff analyst and with the help of a Cal-Mortgage advisory loan committee 
member who also acted as broker on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan committee member, Goldman Sachs & Co. Vice President Vincent F. 
Forte, abstained from voting on Triad's application in December, 1990, as 
Cal-Mortgage rules required at the time. But Margolin said at the Feb. 22 
hearing that Forte still violated public expectations of ethical conduct on the 
part of state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting Forte's defense that he acted in accordance with state law and 
program policy at the time, Margolin called his role in the Triad deal "a 
rather clear and vivid ethical breech." Goldman Sachs netted $2.4 million in 
commissions as underwriter on Triad's original loan and the subsequent 
$167-million refinancing. The company has said Forte's conduct was ethical. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad's default last July leaves Cal-Mortgage's reserve fund, and potentially 
state taxpayers, on the hook for the debt. The company, which owns Sherman Oaks 
Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks, and West Valley Hospital and Health 
Center in Canoga Park, has since filed for federal bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin's bill, AB 3444, would apply to both paid state officials and 
citizens serving voluntarily on state commissions, boards or committees. They 
would be barred from appearing before the commissions either as paid 
representatives of the applicants or as employees of an applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to learn fully the lessons of Cal-Mortgage's (Triad transaction) and 
ensure that similar programs in state government also understand the lessons of 
this experience," Margolin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Health Committee plans to hold another hearing on Triad to take 
testimony from Larry G. Meeks, the head of Cal-Mortgage's parent agency at the 
time Triad's loan was guaranteed. Meeks currently is on leave from the agency, 
the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). 
</P>
<P>
 State officials now in charge of the Cal-Mortgage program said they have 
already implemented the conflict-of-interest safeguards in Margolin's bill. But 
Margolin said such safeguards should be a matter of state law, not 
agency-to-agency administrative policy.

HILLS' FATE IMPROVES WITH AGE; BASEBALL: NOW PLAYING AT OKLAHOMA, HE HAS 
OVERCOME EARLY HARDSHIPS TO MEET CHALLENGES ON THE DIAMOND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was a tumultuous freshman year at Esperanza High School for Rich Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Rick Hills, died in a Blythe mining accident in the summer of 
1987, just before Rich was to enroll at Moreno Valley Canyon Springs High 
School. Rich had to move from Riverside, where he lived with his father, to 
Yorba Linda to live with his mother and stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 What an emotional burden for a 14-year-old, dealing with the loss of a parent 
and the adjustment to life in a new town, new home and new school. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough to concentrate in class and on the baseball field. Hills, who 
thought he'd be good enough to play on Esperanza's junior varsity team in 1988, 
didn't excel in tryouts and felt lucky just to make the freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
 But life took a turn for the better on a May afternoon. Hills was one of a 
handful of lower-level players called up for Esperanza's Southern Section 5-A 
wild-card playoff game against Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought of playing wasn't in Hills' mind -- heck, he didn't even have a 
varsity jersey -- but then third baseman Kevin Webb pulled a hamstring running 
out a triple in the bottom of the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 With Aztec Coach Mike Curran planning to bring flame-throwing second baseman 
Doug Saunders in to pitch the top of the seventh, there were suddenly two 
infield vacancies. He told Hills to find a jersey and play catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so nervous I couldn't even button the jersey up," Hills said. "I had to 
have (teammate) Jason Moler do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing he knew, Hills was playing third in the top of the seventh. He was 
the first freshman -- and still the only freshman -- to play in a varsity game 
for the Aztecs in Curran's 14 years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry, with Saunders throwing, no one is going to pull the ball," 
Curran told his frightened freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Clairvoyant, Curran wasn't. With two outs and Esperanza holding a 4-1 lead, a 
hard grounder headed straight for Hills, who fielded it cleanly -- if not 
calmly -- and threw to first to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, nothing but good things happened for Rich," Curran said. "He was 
a tremendous player for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hills went on to become a three-year starter for Esperanza, and he recently 
began his third season as starting shortstop for Oklahoma, which won two of 
three games in last weekend's Anaheim Hilton & Towers Classic at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Things might have turned out this way regardless of whether Hills made that 
play as a freshman, but Hills can't underestimate the boost that experience 
gave him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's still one of the highlights of my career," said Hills, an All-Big 
Eight first-team selection last season. "After that game, I felt I gained a lot 
of respect from a lot of varsity players. They gained confidence in me and I 
gained confidence in myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Hills got more playing time during the Aztecs' 1988 run to the 5-A 
championship game, where they lost to Diamond Bar, 3-2, in Anaheim Stadium. He 
became the team's starting third baseman as a sophomore and moved to shortstop 
his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 195-pound Hills developed a reputation as one of Esperanza's 
hardest working and most consistent players, and he helped the Aztecs win 
Empire League titles in 1990 and '91. The '91 team was ranked No. 1 in the 
nation before losing to Long Beach Millikan in the 5-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But while several of his 1991 teammates were heavily recruited by Division I 
schools and scouted by professional teams, Hills couldn't seem to turn any 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawbacks: Hills didn't have great speed, and he might have been a little 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd talk to college guys and say I have a damn good shortstop and they'd say, 
'Sure, sure,' " Curran said. "It was one of those deals when you're wondering, 
'Geez, what am I seeing that no one else is seeing? Or maybe I'm not seeing him 
right. Or maybe he's not as good as I think.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hills had decided to attend Cypress College until Oklahoma Coach Larry Cochell 
called in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochell, who coached at Fullerton from 1988-90, had told a Southern California 
scout he needed a shortstop, and the scout gave him Hills' name. Cochell called 
Curran, who gave Hills a ringing endorsement, and the following week, Cochell 
came out to see for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooner coach, who took over a last-place program in 1991, liked what he 
saw. A week after the season, Hills was in Norman for a recruiting visit. He 
liked the town, the campus and loved the baseball facilities. He felt 
comfortable with the Oklahoma coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochell offered Hills a scholarship, the only Division I coach to do so. Hills 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, Big Time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched great teams like Oklahoma State on TV, and it was a little 
intimidating coming out of high school," Hills said. "I thought all the 
pitchers would be throwing 90 m.p.h. on the black. But I found out during my 
freshman year that I could play here, and I could make a name here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hills earned the starting shortstop position as a freshman and hit .328 with 
six homers and 23 runs batted in. The Sooners reached the 1992 College World 
Series, and Hills homered in their only victory in Omaha, over Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Hills improved to .361. He hit only two homers but became more of 
a clutch hitter, more of an opposite-field hitter and had 53 RBIs. He also 
reduced his error totals from 19 as a freshman to 12 as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hills is off to an excellent start this season, batting .438 with four 
doubles, two homers and 13 RBIs for Oklahoma, 7-1 and ranked 14th in this 
week's poll by Collegiate Baseball magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hills trimmed down from 210 pounds last season to 195, he's a little quicker 
and has made only one error in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought my weight was a problem, but I guess other people 
might have," Hills said. "It might not affect my play at this level, but at the 
next level, guys will be bigger, faster and stronger. In order to make it, I 
had to do something to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochell said he has been getting positive feedback from scouts, and he expects 
Hills to get drafted in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives us stability in the infield," Cochell said. "He'll make the routine 
play all day long, and that's what you want. He'll make the great play, too, 
but what coaches don't like is when there's a runner at third with two out, and 
a routine grounder gets thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's also an 'up' guy who won't let a bad at-bat affect him in the field. 
He's been a good player and a good person, a leader who sets the standard for 
younger players coming through the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Hills loves it at Oklahoma. His mother and stepfather, Donna and Jerry Stahl, 
moved to Arkansas last summer and are only a few hours away, and Hills couldn't 
be happier about his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one thing missing: his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me everything before I got to Esperanza and he loved watching me 
play," Hills said. "His memory drives me in a lot of ways. A lot of times when 
I get down, I think about what he would have wanted me to do, and it helps keep 
me going. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird, though. If that (accident) never happened, I never would have 
been involved with the Esperanza program, which is outstanding. Everything 
worked out for the best as far as baseball, but it would have been great to 
have him around. I guess everything happens for a reason."UNIVERSITY OF O

OPPONENT'S INJURY HAS ESPINO ON ROPES; BOXING: TRAGEDY ALMOST STRIKES TWICE FOR 
FORUM FIGHTER BUT MERCEDES, HIS LATEST FOE, IS RECOVERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Miguel Mercedes lost consciousness, Cecilio Espino lost hold on his 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeping uncontrollably, Espino limped back to the Forum dressing room Tuesday 
night, not knowing if tragedy again had followed him into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Espino did not know then that Mercedes' condition would eventually be 
stabilized, that the blood leaking into Mercedes' skull would be slowed, then 
stopped by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes did not need surgery and was moved out of the Cedars-Sinai Hospital 
intensive-care unit Wednesday. A doctor said he could be discharged Friday if 
the swelling in his skull continues to recede. 
</P>
<P>
 All Espino knew Tuesday night at the Forum was that the scene resembled the 
night in 1989, when Hector Ruiz suffered injuries that led to his death after a 
fight with Espino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was crying, yes," Espino said. "I saw his eyes were like, turning, and I 
was worried. Same exact thing with this guy happened with the other. So I was 
worried. I was thinking, 'Oh my God, it's going to happen again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On May 22, 1989, Hector Ruiz collapsed and died after a six-round fight 
against Espino in Mexico, almost causing Espino to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 All Espino could think of as Mercedes sank to the canvas Tuesday was that 
night in Mexico and the blood on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I would do if it happened again," Espino said. "You have a 
heart and you believe in God . . . it's hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in my dressing room and they told me, 'You know what? This guy is bad, 
he's in the (Forum medical unit).' I just pulled my pants up and went to see 
him. But I couldn't see him, he was already at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Ruiz tragedy, Espino said he consciously let up during fights. And 
he said he let up against Mercedes, who actually knocked Espino down in the 
first round. The fight was stopped at :45 of the 10th round, with Mercedes 
trapped against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hitting him with these hard punches, and I was thinking, 'Why doesn't 
this guy fall down and why doesn't the referee (James Jen-Kin) come in?' " 
Espino said. "I wasn't even trying to hit him a lot because I knew he was 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes, 33, lost consciousness and had to be carried from the ring on a 
stretcher after absorbing hundreds of blows from Espino in the super-flyweight 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests at Westside Hospital revealed a burst vein in the area between his skull 
and brain. But after doctors decided immediate surgery was unnecessary, they 
moved him to Cedars-Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks like he could be fine," said Robert Karns, the Forum's ringside 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fight was stopped, Mercedes sagged to the canvas from his stool. His 
eyes rolled, then closed. His hand gripped the bottom ring rope. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going in and out," his manager, Elvis Phillips, said Wednesday. "I was 
hitting him with ice water, splashing him with ice on his neck, just hoping and 
praying he would come back and not go away for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said Mercedes never lost consciousness again, but when the tests 
showed the bleeding, everyone knew the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he realized there was a problem that they were thinking about maybe 
operating, he started to get afraid," Phillips said. "I reassured him the best 
I could, told him it wasn't serious -- but it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes, a Dominican training in New York who had a 14-7 record before 
Tuesday and hadn't fought in 14 months, will never fight again, his manager 
said. His brother, Eleoncio, was the World Boxing Council flyweight champion 
but was shot and killed in the Dominican Republic in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said he hopes to meet with Jerry Buss, owner of the Forum, to discuss 
ways the Forum could help Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there's great concern for the fighter," said John Jackson, 
president of Forum Boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the most serious injury sustained in a Forum fight since July 22, 
1985, when light-heavyweight Chris Schwenke suffered permanent brain damage 
when he fell into a coma and underwent brain surgery after being knocked out by 
Prince Mohammed.

FINDING THEIR NICHE; USC: FRESHMEN BOSEMAN, JONES EMERGING AS BRUIN RIVAL 
O'BANNON NOW STRUGGLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was tough for USC's Stais Boseman and Avondre Jones to watch fellow 
freshman Charles O'Bannon gain national exposure while playing for highly 
touted UCLA at the beginning of this basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 With each soaring O'Bannon dunk and no-look pass shown as a television 
highlight during the Bruins' 14-0 run, Boseman and Jones simply shook their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because it was only a year ago that they were mentioned in the same 
sentence with O'Bannon as top collegiate prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real deserving for him (to gain national recognition) since he did 
come in and start as a true freshman," said Boseman, who attended Inglewood 
Morningside High and played against O'Bannon and Jones last season when they 
starred at Artesia. "But I could not help but feel frustrated seeing Charles 
and UCLA enjoy the success they have this year. You had to ask yourself why you 
weren't enjoying the same success." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first two months of the season, O'Bannon dominated the Pacific 10 
Conference as the league's top newcomer. Since then, however, his numbers have 
dropped, whereas Boseman and Jones have come on strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, these highly regarded freshmen will meet again when No. 15-ranked 
UCLA travels across town to play USC at 9 at the Sports Arena before a national 
ESPN audience. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, 19-4 overall and 12-3 in the Pacific 10, is tied for first place with 
Arizona in the conference standings and is trying to gain a No. 1 regional 
seeding in the NCAA tournament. USC (13-11, 6-9) needs a victory to keep alive 
any hopes of securing a National Invitation Tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
 It's pressure time for three freshmen who only a year ago were high school 
seniors preparing for Southern Section playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon, a 6-foot-7 leaper who was on three State championship teams at 
Artesia, began the season playing like a veteran. He averaged 11 points -- 
including three dunks -- and 6.3 rebounds a game in the first month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon and his older brother, Ed, led the Bruins temporarily into the No. 1 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 It all appeared so easy for O'Bannon as he made the transition from high 
school to college, while making Coach Jim Harrick look good for starting him in 
his first college game. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the situation changed. The Bruins began to struggle, and with every 
loss O'Bannon's luster began to dim. As teams around the Pac-10 scouted him 
more thoroughly, his scoring and rebounding averages dropped to 10.1 and 6.1 in 
29 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick still praises his young freshman's rebounding and defense, but has 
said that O'Bannon has had trouble in the Bruins' half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, Boseman and Jones have had different seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Trojans began the season by winning 10 of their first 12 games, 
Boseman and Jones played sparingly. They started six games and averaged only 
seven points and five rebounds in 29 minutes a game . . . combined . 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three games, however, they have displayed clear signs of the 
ability that made them blue-chip recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Trojans' defensive stopper, Boseman, a 6-4 guard, took center stage 
last Saturday when he played Cal's Jason Kidd one-on-one and came away with 
three big steals and 13 points in the Trojans' 86-78 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a 6-11 center, is third in the Pac-10 in blocked shots and has become 
an intimidating force.

WITH A NEW COUNTRY, SHE SEES NEW HORIZONS; L.A. MARATHON: MEXICAN-BORN OLGA 
APPELL HOPES TO GO PLACES AS AMERICA'S FASTEST FEMALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Funny how joining a country of 248 million can make a person feel so alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Appell raised her right hand with 109 others at the Albuquerque Elks Club 
last Friday and shivered not in joy, but weariness. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to be a day of excitement, of liberation. With one oath, 
Mexico's fastest female marathoner became the United States' fastest female 
marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
 She had made the most important run of her life, a run for the border. And she 
had finished. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did she feel so strange? Why could she not stop thinking about her 
disapproving brothers in the mountain town of Durango, Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 Why could she not stop thinking about a Mexican government official whose 
alleged extortion attempts drove her from the country? A man who has vowed to 
cause her more grief? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so happy," Appell said. "But also, I feel a little sad." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, at home with only her 6-year-old daughter, there was no party, no 
congratulatory phone call, no celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what Sunday is for. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing bib No. F1 for her first race as a U.S. citizen, Appell hopes to turn 
the Los Angeles Marathon into a personal welcoming reception. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes to see the course lined with Latino spectators. She hopes to hear 
cheers from those who also refuse to accept oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes not merely to finish among the leaders, but live up to her status as 
the favorite by winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, perhaps, she will hear a chant that will feel like a hug. It has become 
a cliche, but it will remind her that becoming a citizen was not just her best 
choice, but her only choice: "U.S.A., U.S.A."  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very, very special race for me," said Appell, 30. "All the Latino 
people, the sense of community there . . . all for my first race as an 
American. Yes, I want very, very much to win." 
</P>
<P>
 This new beginning also represents the end of a long, twisting road for this 
former secretary who began running to lose weight after giving birth to 
daughter Monique six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While she cites Monique's stability as the main reason she decided to join her 
husband, Brian, as a U.S. citizen, she admits she was also pushed from a 
country that once considered her a heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the government controls the press, I don't know if anybody even knows 
I am gone yet," Appell said. "But when they find out, well, maybe I won't be 
such a hero anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Her last major race as a Mexican was last fall in the New York Marathon, where 
she was second in 2 hours 28 minutes 56 seconds, faster than any American woman 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Brian Appell, her husband and coach, the president of the 
Mexican Athletics Federation, Mexico's governing body for track and field, 
asked for one-third of her $30,000 winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Nunez Arana allegedly phoned Brian Appell and requested $10,000 or he 
would suspend Olga from the federation because she was never given formal 
permission to run in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he was crazy," said Brian, a former track star at Fountain Valley 
High. "It was the last straw." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez, contacted through an interpreter at his Mexico City home Wednesday, 
called Appell's charges, "an absolute lie." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what this woman is looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez warned that the Mexican government would hold Appell to the letter of 
the international track law, which forbids a defecting athlete from competing 
in a world-class event for three years after their last appearance for their 
old country. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Appell ran for Mexico in the World Championships last August, the rule 
could prevent her from running in the 1996 Olympic Games at Atlanta were she to 
qualify for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. track officials cite a clause in the rule that allows athletes 
who change countries because of marriage to begin competing for their new 
country immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect her to be in the hunt for a medal in Atlanta," said John Mansoor, 
assistant to the executive director of USA Track & Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be the first time Appell has been given a break. She said that even 
from her first victory as a Mexican runner, she suffered from mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an American, I can now run stress-free," she said. "I can run where I 
want. I don't have to ask permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Appell said she was backed into a corner from the time she was a surprise 
3,000-meter winner in the Mexican national championships three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She had trained in Germany, so officials didn't believe she was Mexican. She 
had to retrieve her birth certificate from Durango before her victory was 
declared official. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, she said, she was forced to pay her way from Germany to an 
America's Cup race in Colombia because the Mexican federation failed to 
reimburse her plane ticket as promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in her moment of greatest triumph -- a marathon victory in the Pan 
American Games in Cuba in 1991 -- there was a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she wanted to run the 10,000 meters instead of the marathon, but the 
Mexican federation forced her to run the longer distance. Four weeks later, she 
faltered in the 10,000 meters at a lucrative meet because she was exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of her family, particularly two brothers, still wondered why 
she would turn her back on her homeland. Until she signed the papers in 
December, she questioned it herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Appell hopes Sunday will provide another persuasive argument. "I will wear the 
same running clothes as always, I will be the same runner," she said. "But I 
will be different." 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: AGASSI, TENNIS NEED EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every time I used to look at Andre Agassi, I would think of Eddie Stanky. You 
remember. The ballplayer of whom Leo Durocher once said, "He can't run, he 
can't hit, he can't throw. All he does is beat you." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Agassi won Wimbledon, and I realized I had misjudged him. This was no 
good-field, no-hit banjo artist. This was a tenacious, dangerous, superbly 
skilled player who would take a lot of beating. 
</P>
<P>
 His on-court demeanor was intimidating. On court, his eyes were cruel, 
merciless, the eyes of a dictator. They had no interest in you whatsoever. You 
were a statistic, not an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 From a distance, he appeared dislikable. He let his hair grow, his beard grow. 
He refused to tuck his shirt in, to wear white or do any of the things tennis 
used to make you do. He'd wear a tank top if he felt like it. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a rebel, but that had become kind of boring. Today, who isn't? He 
didn't appear to care whether you liked him or not so long as you gave him the 
line calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, he didn't seem to particularly care for his line of work. He 
dispatched opponents with the ruthless efficiency of a contract killer. When he 
got ahead of you, you were usually done for. He never really displayed a lot of 
emotion. It was unfortunate, but you were in his way. He was passionate, but 
not compassionate. 
</P>
<P>
 The public was fascinated by him. The groupies, of course, adored him. He 
managed to look cute in his kind of hyperactive way. But about the only 
concession he would make to the fans was, he would throw his sweaty shirt into 
a crowd of shrieking young girls at the end of a (winning) match. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Avenue cottoned to him. He was not your monotonous serve-and-volley 
player. Two-shots-and-the-point's-over. His matches were brawls, not recitals. 
Cockfights. Not your basic, "Nice shot, Grizzy!" type of politesse. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost never lost his composure. Not for him the McEnroe or Nastase 
tantrums. He got even with a backhand down the line, not a stream of curses. 
</P>
<P>
 He hurried everywhere. No one ever saw him saunter, stroll or even sit still 
very long. He always looked like a guy running for a bus. He came on court like 
a whirling gust of woodpeckers. He never stood still a moment. His eyes darted 
around. He was in a hurry. He seemed to want to get it over with one way or the 
other. He had more important things to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis had to respect him. He lost with a shrug. Sometimes, he won with a 
shrug too. He never seemed to change expressions much either way. 
</P>
<P>
 If he wasn't quite the image they wanted, he was a magnificent athlete. 
Charlie Pasarell, no less, thinks Agassi's hand-eye coordination was such that 
he almost never hit the ball anywhere but in the middle of the racket. He hit 
the ball exactly where he wanted to, most of the time. Usually, it was some 
place you had just left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a funny thing, but he always appeared smaller than he was. He wasn't 
small. He was just a shade under six feet. But his legs were not long, nor his 
arms. He scurried around the court like a chipmunk; he didn't have the reach of 
those long-legged Tildens of yesteryear. But when the ball came down, he was, 
like DiMaggio, usually there waiting for it. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning Wimbledon -- in 1992 -- his interest in the game seemed to begin 
to wane. He appeared overweight, listless. At times, not even competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 He had not come up through the traditional knotted-white-sweater, 
tea-between-sets atmosphere of tennis. Dad was a casino executive in Las Vegas, 
and young Andre was on the court very early and with much expected. 
</P>
<P>
 He was explaining the other night during the Newsweek Champions Cup at the 
Grand Champions resort here that he didn't have much of a choice in the matter. 
Someone put a tennis racket in his hands almost in his infancy. "I was packed 
off to a tennis camp when I was 13," he said. "I didn't have too many other 
options." 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, a sobering thing happened to Andre Agassi. His right wrist gave 
in to tendinitis. There was an operation. He suddenly couldn't play tennis at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 And he found, somewhat to his surprise, that he missed it. That he was right 
where he belonged all the while. He fell in the rankings. At 23, he was 
yesterday's roses. Not bad news, no news. He wasn't a burnout, he was a 
flameout. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't St. Paul falling off a horse, but it was a revelation. "I realized 
tennis is part of who I am," he said. "I realized tennis was me. That tennis 
was something I did, something I wanted to do, something I needed. My 
profession is very important to me now." 
</P>
<P>
 He bought a gym, lost weight, skipped fast foods, trained like a prizefighter. 
A sleek, new, streamlined Agassi hustled onto the court here this week and it 
seemed like old times. Vintage Agassi. Although his own serve rarely exceeded 
99 m.p.h., he easily returned 110-m.p.h. serves of his opponent. He easily 
dispatched Richey Reneberg, and visions of the Wimbledon championship began to 
dance in the heads. 
</P>
<P>
 He went before the press and termed his hiatus a "blessing in disguise," a 
turning point in his career. He added: "I am focused now." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis was ready to circle the wagons. Agassi was back and better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Or was he? 
</P>
<P>
 Alas! Tennis being tennis, Agassi went out the next afternoon to play a 
journeyman -- 99th in the world -- named Fabrice Santoro, a guy with no 
Wimbledon in his past -- nor probably in his future. 
</P>
<P>
 He beat Agassi in straight sets, 6-4, 7-6. This is bad news to the tournament 
-- and the game. It's nice to know Agassi now knows he needs tennis -- because 
the game sure needs him.

DESHIELDS HIT IN FACE WITH A FLYING BAT; DODGERS: HE SUFFERS BROKEN CHEEKBONE, 
BUT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH A PROTECTIVE MASK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a chilling moment Wednesday, Delino DeShields suffered a fractured 
cheekbone when a loose bat struck him on the side of the face as he stood near 
a batting cage. DeShields, the Dodgers' new second baseman, was taken by 
ambulance to Indian River Memorial Hospital in Vero Beach, where he was 
examined and released. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who will undergo outpatient surgery next week, can return to spring 
training drills as soon as he feels able. But Frank Jobe, Dodger team 
physician, said DeShields should avoid playing in a game until a plastic mask 
can be made to protect him as he heals. The mask, similar to one worn by Robby 
Thompson last season after he was hit by a pitch, will be available in about a 
week. The Dodgers open the exhibition season Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine, I'm living and I'm all right," DeShields said before asking that 
reporters wait a day to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred in the indoor batting cages when a bat swung by Mike 
Busch slipped out of his hands, crashed against the floor-to-ceiling netting 
and hit DeShields, who was standing outside the cage in an area where coaches 
and players often gather. The netting, which is not taut, easily gave with the 
force of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were hitting in the cage Wednesday because of heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The bat hit DeShields on the left side of his face, below his eye, cutting him 
in two places. Paramedics and trainers were summoned as a shaken Busch, a 
Dodger minor-leaguer, knelt nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bad -- if it hits him on the temple, he could have been killed," Brett 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 As news spread throughout the clubhouse, players ran to the batting cages to 
see if DeShields was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields remained conscious as he was tended to for about 25 minutes before 
being taken to the hospital, accompanied by trainer Charlie Strasser and Jobe's 
assistant, Dr. Pat McMann. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with him the whole time until he got into the ambulance," Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda said. "He seemed like he was in a great deal of pain. His 
eyes were all watery. I thought it was really something serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobe called DeShields "very fortunate," saying the fracture will not require 
pinning, as Alfredo Griffin's did in 1991 after he suffered a broken cheekbone 
when he slid into Barry Larkin's knee. Griffin wore a plastic mask and missed 
about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as bad of a fracture as Alfredo Griffin's was, and that is 
encouraging," Jobe said. 
</P>
<P>
 After DeShields had gone, Busch returned to the clubhouse and sat alone at his 
locker, staring. Players left him alone, except to tell him it wasn't his 
fault. Later, Busch said he was OK. "It was unfortunate," he said.

PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL / DAN HAFNER; WILL KIDD LEAVE BEFORE REACHING FINAL GOAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jason Kidd, probably the most sought-after prep basketball player to 
choose California, decided to play at Berkeley, he cited three goals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In his freshman season (1992-93), he wanted to help the Bears reach the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In this, his sophomore season, he wanted Cal to reach the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And next season, his plan called for the Bears to win their first national 
title since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The ease with which Cal advanced to the round of 16 last season made it appear 
possible that the 6-foot-4 playmaker would achieve all three. After winning 
eight of their last nine Pacific 10 games, the Bears defeated Louisiana State 
and Duke before losing to Kansas in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It now seems likely that Kidd, one of the country's best players, will not 
achieve either of his last two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be his fault if Cal doesn't make it to the Final Four this season. 
Injuries have cost the team two starters and an outstanding freshman guard, 
Randy Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 As for 1994-95, Kidd will probably be playing in the NBA by then. And junior 
Lamond Murray, also one of the nation's top players, might turn professional as 
well. Nobody has said any of this officially, but it seems obvious that Kidd 
would be at home on a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 The handicap of trying to carry a team with only seven players is proving to 
be a bit too much for Kidd and Murray. Both seem to be slowly wearing down. 
Their play enabled the Bears to build seemingly comfortable leads against UCLA 
and USC last week, before they wilted. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal managed to outlast the Bruins, but Saturday the young, physical Trojans 
simply wore the Bears out. The same thing figures to happen in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Few realize how important Alfred Grigsby and K.J. Roberts, the missing 
regulars, were to this team. As a sophomore last season, the 6-9 Grigsby was 
the fourth-leading scorer and No. 3 rebounder. He kept Monty Buckley on the 
bench. Still, with more playing time because of Grigsby's absence, Buckley is 
becoming a solid player. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Todd Bozeman's first moves after replacing Lou Campanelli as coach in 
February of 1993 was to put Roberts in the lineup opposite Kidd at guard. 
Roberts played a major role in the Bears' late spurt. He played so well that 
the man he replaced, Jerod Haase, transferred to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Grigsby and Roberts were lost early this season, probably because each 
tried to return too soon from injuries. Grigsby, who has a hamstring tear, 
played in three games, then re-injured himself. Roberts, who has a stress 
fracture in his foot, played in six games before he had to sit out the rest of 
the season. Duck broke his arm after playing in the first 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
 With four more Pac-10 games -- at home this week against Oregon and Oregon 
State, then on the road next week at Washington and Washington State -- the 
Bears, 10-4 in the conference, still have a chance to win the title. But it's a 
slim one at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona and UCLA, tied at the top with 12-3 records, each have three games 
remaining. The Bears would have to win all four, and the Bruins and the 
Wildcats lose at least one each, to tie for the title. Cal would win either a 
three-way or two-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a hard-fought victory over Oregon on Saturday at Eugene, Arizona is in 
the best position to win another Pac-10 title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, who are at home against Washington and Washington State this 
week, have won six games in a row since losing to the Huskies in Seattle. 
Arizona will finish conference play on March 12 against Arizona State at Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Wildcats have been coming on strong, the Sun Devils have been 
slumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like our chances," said Khalid Reeves, Wildcat senior guard. "I like the 
position we're in. We just have to keep bearing down in our last three games." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which won the Pac-10 title in 1991-92 (the only season Arizona hasn't 
been the champion since 1987), will play its last three games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they get past the suddenly aroused Trojans tonight at the Sports 
Arena, the Bruins won't be home free. They play Oregon at Eugene on March 12, 
and the Ducks have shown steady improvement. If Arizona and UCLA finish in a 
tie, the Wildcats would win the title because of a better record against Cal, 
which would finish third.

HENNING BECOMES TOP MAN AT BC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Henning, former coach of the San Diego Chargers and Atlanta Falcons, was 
named coach at Boston College on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeds Tom Coughlin, who left the Eagles on Feb. 21 to coach the 
Jacksonville Jaguars, an NFL expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Boston College's president, the Rev. J. Donald Monan, 
introduced Henning as Dan Topping, who was a former owner of the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning, 51, is still being paid by the Detroit Lions, who fired him in 
December after two seasons as offensive coordinator. He coached the Chargers in 
1989-91 and the Falcons in 1983-86 and has been an assistant with several pro 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 His college coaching experience has been as an assistant at Florida State and 
Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning's pro record was 38-73-1.

EVANS JOINS 3 OTHERS OUT OF JOBS; BASKETBALL: PITT, DAYTON FIRE COACHES. 
CREIGHTON AND FURMAN ACCEPT RESIGNATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Evans had taken Pittsburgh to five of the last seven NCAA tournaments and 
at one time this season had a 13-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Panthers lost seven games in a row to drop their record to 13-12, 
7-10 in the Big East, and on Wednesday they lost their coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans was one of four coaches who were fired or resigned from Division I jobs, 
including Jim O'Brien, who was fired at Dayton; Rick Johnson, who resigned 
before he could be fired at Creighton, and Butch Estes, who resigned at Furman. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans will stay through the Big East tournament and any postseason tournament 
the Panthers make. He is 147-96 since replacing Roy Chipman in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans previously coached at St. Lawrence College and Navy and has a 392-206 
overall record in 21 college seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien coached Dayton to only 10 victories in the last two seasons. He had a 
61-84 record in five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy with the decision that the university has made to fire me. I 
believe it is a mistake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to take any questions at his news conference and said his players 
would not be available to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had a 24-59 record in three seasons, including 7-22 this season. The 
22 losses were the most for a season in Creighton's 75-year basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about the program and the direction in which it was headed. 
We had to be satisfied that it was moving in the right direction," Tom Moore, 
Creighton's athletic director, said. "We had a question of whether Rick was 
taking us in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he had not had time to meet with his players to tell them of his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timetable decided on by the university didn't allow that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes had a 134-121 record in his nine seasons at Furman, but the Paladins 
slumped the past two seasons and are 9-17 this year.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY'S NAME SURFACES AGAIN IN NEWS REPORT 
ON IRS INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took 13 days of spring training before controversy found Darryl Strawberry, 
and the news that surfaced Wednesday was a little more than rehash of an issue 
that has plagued Strawberry for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Daily News reported that Strawberry is getting closer to being 
indicted for federal income tax evasion, a result of an investigation first 
reported in June. The report, quoting sources, said that Strawberry failed to 
disclose "in excess of $300,000" of income from signing autographs at baseball 
card and memorabilia shows, dating to 1988. It also said Strawberry had 
recently hired an attorney to work out a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dodgertown on Wednesday in Vero Beach, Fla., Strawberry said he had done 
nothing wrong. He said he hired attorney Marty Gelfand of Los Angeles about six 
months ago, who has told him there is no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you think he (Marty) would have told me if he was working out a plea 
bargain?" Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report surfaced at a time when things seemingly are going well for 
Strawberry. This spring, he has received rave reviews by the club for his 
attitude, work ethic and performance. "I don't think anything will disrupt me 
now from what I want to achieve," Strawberry said. ". . . You live and learn 
you can't change things that you've done, all you can do is to correct yourself 
from that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, has made it clear he will 
continue to give Strawberry a chance to turn things around, providing there are 
no new problems and the old ones are adequately resolved. Claire said that 
although he is aware of the reports, he has never been contacted by the IRS or 
any agency, and has no information. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News reported that the investigation, by the IRS and the U.S. 
attorney's office in White Plains, N.Y., includes former Mets Lenny Dykstra and 
Howard Johnson and former Dodger Eric Davis. The probe centers on the Mets' 
1986 championship team, but only Strawberry is facing criminal charges, the 
report said.

 Tom Candiotti will start in Friday's opening exhibition game against the New 
York Mets at Port St. Lucie. Greg Hansell, Roger McDowell and Jim Gott are 
scheduled to follow. For the Mets, Pete Smith, Frank Seminara, Mike Maddux and 
Mauro Gozzo will pitch. MARYANN HUDSON

WOLF HAS NO GRAND SCHEME; AFTER BANNER JUNIOR SEASON, EL CAMINO REAL'S ACE 
PITCHER HASN'T CHANGED HIS PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would have been the perfect way to end a high school career. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the mound in the stadium of your dreams. Crowd going wild. Tying 
run at third and winning run at second. Two out and a full count in the last 
inning of the biggest game of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 A curveball. A swing and a miss. Teammates mobbing you on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been the storybook finish to Randy Wolf's days at El Camino Real 
High. Would have been, but he was only a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 What now, Randy? 
</P>
<P>
 He's made a mess for himself. He did everything last year. Wolf pitched a 
no-hitter and a perfect game in consecutive starts. He earned a save in the 
City Section 4-A Division championship game at Dodger Stadium. He was named 
City 4-A player of the year and Times' Valley pitcher of the year -- all before 
his 17th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 This season Wolf has to throw three consecutive no-hitters, win all of his 
starts and end world hunger or he is merely treading water. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure? Not according to Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to do my best," the senior left-hander said. "I can't do anything 
other than that. I'm not going to think I have to throw four no-hitters or 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf shrugs his shoulders in response to questions about his success. This is 
the Wolf you expect. Laid-back. Blond hair and a big smile. No worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have a big head," teammate Clint Marcus said. "He doesn't let all 
of his accomplishments affect the way he acts toward other people. That's what 
makes him a really good leader on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the middle of pitching a great game, Wolf will do anything to avoid 
the spotlight. No fist-pumping antics. Just a smirk. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he strikes out the side or something, he'll come back to the bench and 
he'll have this big ol' smile on his face and he won't say anything," El Camino 
Real senior Justin Martin said. "That big ol' smile. He won't say anything, but 
you know what he's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 The way to get to Wolf -- and it sure isn't by trying to hit against him -- is 
by complimenting him. Want to see him off balance? Ask what it's like to be 
named the 47th best high school prospect in the nation by Baseball America 
magazine. "It doesn't mean anything," he said. "Who comes up with that stuff 
anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks ago, Wolf and Marcus were in a fast-food restaurant when 
someone recognized Wolf and asked about the draft. What kind of money would it 
take to sign Wolf away from a scholarship at Pepperdine? Wolf stammered and 
spit out the first thing that came to mind: "Five cents."  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't really want to say anything," Marcus said. "He just did something 
to change the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf doesn't want to worry about the draft or Pepperdine or no-hitters or 
3-and-2 curveballs or expectations. Not even Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think about (the championship game) a lot, almost every day," Wolf 
said, "but now I try not to think about it because I want to get there again. 
But it's a different team, so I try to forget about it and start over." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that we've created the image of Randy Wolf, the nice, All-American boy 
with the golden arm, forget it for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not always that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a temper that you wouldn't believe," his mother, Judy, said. "When he 
was 9 or 10, he didn't like a call the umpire made, so he yelled to him that he 
(was terrible)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's father, Jim, says Randy used to be frustrated when his teammates didn't 
perform to the level he expected of himself. Once, he was so upset he walked 
off the field in the middle of a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had an attitude and was always getting (ticked) off at everything," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another game, Wolf was playing outfield when his coach motioned for him to 
move a few steps. Next thing Wolf knew, a ball dropped for a hit near the spot 
he had vacated. When Wolf got to the dugout at the end of the half-inning, he 
made sure to tell the coach he had blown it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Wolf was a troublemaker, but he did need a few stern conversations 
from his father about sportsmanship and learning to play with others. "You'd 
never suspect it today," his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither would you suspect that Wolf is a head-banger. A real heavy metal 
maniac. Metallica. Anthrax. Doesn't matter. The harder the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listens to hard-core stuff," said Kevin Szymanski, a teammate of Wolf's 
last season at El Camino Real. "Really hard stuff that you've probably never 
even heard of." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems out of character for Wolf. He looks as if he ought to be listening to 
Garth Brooks, swinging in a hammock and sipping lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Randy Wolf who listens to Metallica is the one who won all those games 
and pitched those no-hitters. He's the one who prompted interest in the other 
Randy Wolf, the quiet one who doesn't want to talk about all of those victories 
and no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf often psychs himself up for a game by listening to heavy metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings that stuff on the field," Marcus said. "When he gets out there, 
he's really intense." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin simplifies: "He doesn't take any . . . from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Wolf was spectacular in his first year of pitching for the 
varsity last season. He was 11-1 with a 1.05 earned-run average. In 79 1/3 
innings, Wolf struck out 118 and allowed only 37 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing watching him throw," said Martin, El Camino Real's center 
fielder. "You just sit back and wait for the next fly ball or strikeout. It 
just gets repetitive. You knew when Randy was pitching you were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf started high school with the reputation of being a good pitcher. He 
pitched a no-hitter in an all-star game the summer before his freshman year. 
But El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio wanted to develop him as a hitter his first 
two years, so Wolf played solely in the outfield. He batted .404 as a freshman 
and .387 as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he could pitch," Maio says. "That wasn't a question. But we were 
bringing him along in the outfield. If I'm going to be wrong on a freshman, I'm 
going to be wrong waiting and using him too late rather than too early." 
</P>
<P>
 Maio points out that even Ryan McGuire, who is the only player other than Wolf 
to start for four years at El Camino Real, didn't pitch as a freshman. McGuire 
later pitched and played first base at UCLA and was drafted in the third round 
last year by the Boston Red Sox. Wolf can expect to follow McGuire into the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts' assessments of Wolf vary. About 200 watched closely when Wolf pitched 
last summer at the Area Code Games, a showcase for the stars of the high school 
class of 1994. Wolf's fastball has been clocked at 82 m.p.h., but the pitch 
moves. He has an excellent curve and a changeup, and throws all three pitches 
with pinpoint control. His greatest advantage, however, is baseball's dearth of 
outstanding left-handed pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-feet-11 and 180 pounds, he might not add much to his fastball. He also 
has the scholarship to Pepperdine in his back pocket, meaning it would probably 
take at least a $150,000 bonus to sign him. The Baltimore Orioles needed a 
package worth $300,000 to buy Newbury Park shortstop David Lamb out of his 
commitment to Pepperdine last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing Wolf wants, of course, is to talk about money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really thought about it much," he says. "I'm just trying to 
concentrate on this year and get back to Dodger Stadium."

<P>
 Having been forced to buck the odds so many times, did Andre Chevalier expect 
his college basketball career to end any other way? 
</P>
<P>
 With only tonight's game against San Diego State left to play, Chevalier needs 
29 points to become the leading scorer in Cal State Northridge history. 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation, once again, is to write him off. 
</P>
<P>
 His career high is 28. 
</P>
<P>
 His average is 14. 
</P>
<P>
 His chances for the record, therefore, would seem to be remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, there is the matter of Chevalier's track record. 
</P>
<P>
 Courted by Northridge only after a top recruit was declared academically 
ineligible, he has been a starter for the Matadors since the seventh game of 
his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, as a senior at Cleveland High, Chevalier averaged eight points a 
game. Yet here he is, four years later, challenging Jim Malkin's scoring record 
of 1,301 points, a standard that has been in the books for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Count him out? "No way," said Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy. "You never sell 
that young man short." 
</P>
<P>
 Many have. And have been proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier was born without two middle fingers on his left hand and he is 
legally blind in his right eye, conditions some critics predicted would 
preclude him from a successful Division I basketball career. And as a 
ball-handling point guard? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chevalier refused to let that opinion prevail. Defenders who chose to 
attack his alleged weakness often are left groping at air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we should force him to go to his left, to make him use that left 
hand," Grand Canyon Coach Leighton McCrary said. "But after two times down the 
floor we said, 'Why don't we go back to playing him straight up?' He is quick 
on quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Fuller, San Diego State's coach, also considered attacking Chevalier's 
left side. A few minutes studying film convinced him that he should reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "After watching him on tape and watching him play we forgot about that," 
Fuller said. "He's got a better left hand than a lot of our guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller rates the Northridge senior with the best point guards his team has 
faced. McCrary, whose team was scorched by Chevalier for 25 points, 11 assists 
and four steals last month, takes his praise even further. "He's the best guard 
we've seen this year, without a doubt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, coach at Northridge for the past 23 seasons, said he will remember 
Chevalier as "a tough, tenacious kid who gave a helluva lot of people fits." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier already owns Northridge career records for steals, assists and free 
throws, proof that he has flourished rather than merely survived under what has 
been the most challenging of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the entire Northridge team could say the same. The Matadors, 7-18 this 
season, have won 36 games and lost 72 during Chevalier's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individually I exceeded what everybody thought," Chevalier said. "But 
team-wise it's been worse than I ever expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, a fledgling Division I independent, was expected to lose in 
Chevalier's first couple of seasons. However, the Matadors, for a variety of 
reasons, have continued to flounder in each of their past two campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Northridge lost its entire recruiting class of front-court 
players because of injury, academic ineligibility and an automobile accident 
that ended the career of the team's top prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, there have been key injuries, the unexpected death of center 
Peter Micelli's father, and the drama of the Jan. 17 earthquake that left all 
but two Matador players temporarily homeless and the team without the use of 
its home court. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder, then, that Chevalier summarizes his career at Northridge by 
saying, "It's been good. It's been bad. It's been terrible. It's been tragic . 
. . a lifetime of experience in four years." 
</P>
<P>
 The low point has been this season, one Chevalier approached with confidence. 
A postseason berth, if not in the NCAA tournament of 64 then perhaps in the 
NIT, was within reach, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 How quickly those plans unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge opened with consecutive blowout losses against Stanford and 
Gonzaga. The third game, another defeat, Chevalier missed because of a severely 
sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the Matadors enjoying only their second victory after 10 losses, 
Chevalier suffered a broken bone in his right hand during a 90-72 victory over 
Buffalo on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, against UC Irvine, Chevalier missed all eight of his shots 
but still helped Northridge win. He made seven of eight free throws, including 
two with 19.6 seconds left to give the Matadors a 68-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The following game, a setback to St. Mary's, Chevalier again scored only seven 
points. Since then, he is back to his old self, having scored in double figures 
in nine of 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has returned to his typically frantic defensive routine: slapping at 
an opponent's dribble, doing jumping jacks in an effort to interrupt passes and 
diving after every loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining such a pace has not been easy. In the latter part of January, the 
Matadors were jolted both by a 6.7 earthquake centered near the Northridge 
campus and by the death of Nicholas Micelli, an avid booster of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier and his mother, Shirley, were displaced by the quake. The 
22-year-old senior admitted that basketball "was not a top priority" for many 
members of what came to be called "Team Tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the quake, when the team finally got back to playing 
basketball, the Matadors learned that forward Chris Yard, one of their top 
players, had suffered a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 As Northridge concludes its season tonight, there is new concern for another 
teammate. Brent Lofton, a forward Chevalier has known since high school, was 
benched last week at the request of team doctors who thought they might have 
detected a heart abnormality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says college is the best time of your life," Chevalier said. "I 
know I hope these weren't my best years. I hope things are going to get a lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 His experiences at Northridge might not have earned him a professional 
basketball career, but Chevalier is fairly confident he can handle the trials 
and tribulations of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a Matador certainly did not spoil him. 
</P>
<P>
 As a budget-conscious Division I independent, Northridge has in the past four 
years played at home only 39 times in 109 games. Often when the Matadors 
travel, they are booked on special two-for-one deals requiring pre-dawn 
departures on flights that routinely offer two layovers and no meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of things wear you out physically and mentally," Chevalier said. 
"It makes it tough sometimes. When people think of playing Division I 
basketball, they're not thinking about the way it is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Chevalier will leave Northridge with his records, the experiences of 
competing against the likes of UCLA, USC, Cal, Stanford, Missouri and Notre 
Dame and, possibly, as an academic All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pan-African studies major who is interested in a business career, Chevalier 
has a 3.23 grade-point average and has been a regular on the Dean's List. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my experiences at Northridge made me a better person," he said. "I 
don't know if it made me a better player, but I know I'm a stronger person." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly one capable of pulling a final surprise.

YOUNG, GIFTED AND THE BEST IN COUNTY; BASEBALL: KATELLA'S WRIGHT, ORANGE'S 
ARCHULETA, TUSTIN'S BAKER ARE AMONG THE TOP PLAYERS. 
</P>

<P>
 It's high school baseball season. Sunshine and blue skies. Sunflower seeds and 
bad hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bored at work? Then take the afternoon off and check out some of Orange 
County's best. 
</P>
<P>
 Young gun: Baseball America ranks Katella pitcher Jaret Wright as the 
fourth-best high school prospect in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Wright was 4-3 with a 3.01 earned-run average. Not the most 
impressive numbers, but his fastball has been clocked as high as 94 m.p.h, 
according to Katella Coach Tim McMenamin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a scrimmage Saturday and there were 50 scouts there, easy," McMenamin 
said. "There were 25 there, an hour before the game. When Jaret went to warm 
up, there was dead silence. I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright also can hit. He had a .451 average with seven home runs and 26 runs 
batted in. Wright, who plays in the outfield when he's not pitching, might be 
the best all-around player in Orange County. If Katella charged for its home 
games, Wright would be worth the price of admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as much fun is watching Wright's father, former Angel pitcher Clyde 
Wright, in the stands. Wright chips at umpires, opposing coaches, opposing 
players and even opposing fans. He's good for a few laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He keeps everyone loose," McMenamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy campers: A group of Foothill baseball players just couldn't wait for 
practice to officially begin Feb. 19. They were so eager, in fact, they spent 
the night of Feb. 18 on the Foothill baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was leaving school about 8:30 and I saw lights on the field," Knight Coach 
Gerry Sedoo said. "I walked down there and there they were, hitting in the 
batting cage. They had tents and sleeping bags and were set for the night." 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't exactly rough it. The players also brought a television set 
and a VCR. They watched "Major League" and "Eight Men Out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Practice started Feb. 19 and Feb. 19 began at midnight," Knight second 
baseman Jeff Pickler said. "We wanted to get it started." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening wasn't all fun and games, though. It rained part of the night. 
Hopefully, for the Knights, that wasn't an omen. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill finished last in the Century League a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit man: Orange's Saul Archuleta has in sight the county career record for 
hits. Archuleta, a three-year starter, has 97, 54 of which came last season. He 
is within range of Shawn Green's mark of 147. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, an outfielder for Tustin from 1988-91, got a $700,000 signing bonus 
from the Toronto Blue Jays in 1991. That number is out of reach for Archuleta. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally a senior: Tustin's Derek Baker, the seventh-best high school player in 
the nation, according to Baseball America, will be gone after this season. It's 
about time in the eyes of Tiller opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, a third baseman, began his varsity career with a three-run double in 
his first at-bat as a freshman. He hit .405 with five home runs and a 
county-high 37 RBIs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Young gun II: Seth Etherton might not attract quite as many scouts as Wright, 
but he's certainly no slouch. 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton, a senior pitcher, is 28th on the Baseball America list of high 
school players. He was 8-2 last season with a 1.44 ERA and led the county with 
110 strikeouts. Etherton, who has signed with USC, also hit seven home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pete's sake: Pete Zamora, pitcher/first baseman for Capistrano Valley, is 
listed as the 35th-best high school prospect in the nation by Baseball America, 
and scouts already are buzzing around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora, though, already has a trusted and knowledgeable adviser -- his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Zamora is his coach at Capistrano Valley and a former professional player. 
He played in the San Diego Padre organization, reaching the double-A level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was your classic good-field, no-hit outfielder," Zamora said. "But I came 
out of Chapman (College) the same year that the major leagues expanded. I 
walked into the Padres' first tryout camp and got a couple hits in front of 
Buzzie Bavasi. They signed me as a free agent." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zamora doesn't even try to dazzle his son with tales of great exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete will tell you that he's a better hitter right now than I ever was," said 
Zamora, "and he's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Zamora, who has signed with UCLA, isn't bad on the mound either. He was 
8-3 with a 1.45 ERA and 100 strikeouts last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Him again: Empire League football coaches thought they had it bad when Enrico 
Bozman transferred from Bellflower to Los Alamitos last summer. But baseball 
coaches might have it even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Many think Bozman, an outfielder, is better at baseball. He gained 1,532 
yards, scored 24 touchdowns and was named first-team all-county in football. 
How much better can he be? 
</P>
<P>
 Empire League coaches don't want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck of the Irish?: La Quinta's Jim Livernois was 13-3 last season and was 
named The Times Orange County player of the year. But fortunately for him, 
Kennedy comes up on the schedule only twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Livernois has lost to the Fighting Irish eight times in three seasons, 
including twice last year. It's a good bet Livernois doesn't celebrate St. 
Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Like father, like son: Troy outfielder Brad Downing beefed up over the past 
year, looking more and more like his father, former Angel Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Downing hit .290 last season with four home runs, numbers that should 
improve. But even if he does, don't look for a lot of sterling quotes from the 
senior outfielder. He's almost as media-shy as his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Brad that if he had the type of season he was expecting, then some 
reporter might want to do a story on him," Troy Coach Dane Ilertsen said. "He 
said, 'Oh, no. " 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Downing is equally shy about watching his son play. He usually hides 
down the foul line, well away from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ilertsen: "It'll be about the second inning and we'll hear Brian's Harley 
Davidson in the parking lot. Five minutes later, Brian will be hiding behind a 
pole down the line. Brian and Brad are very much alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Or so Ilertsen hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore jinx? Bobby Brito, Cypress' standout outfielder, may not have done 
himself a favor by being such a sensation as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Brito was second in the county with a .542 average. He also had four home runs 
and 33 RBIs. It guaranteed him three years of being thrown at and pitched 
around. In fact, he might not see another strike until after he graduates from 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher's pet: Laguna Hills' Brett Nista receives plenty of praise. As the 
43rd-best high school player in the nation -- according to Baseball America -- 
that's a given. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just his athletic skills that catch people's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least once a week, some teacher will come up to me and say what a great 
kid Brett is in class," Laguna Hills Coach Pete Tereschuk said. "They say what 
a pleasure it is to have him in class, just the opposite of what they would 
expect from someone who receives so much attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills' opponents would prefer Nista be a little nicer on the field. He 
hit .430 and led the county with 11 home runs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista has signed with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat? Esperanza's Jason Murrietta was the county's leading hitter last 
season with a .565 average, but he's getting a little tired of hearing about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's about all people talk to me about," said Murrietta, a catcher. "They 
come up to me and say, 'So, are you going to lead the county again?' How do I 
know? I wasn't thinking about it last year, so I'm not going to think about it 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 That might be wise. Murrietta is one of only two starters returning for the 
Aztecs. Pitchers are certain to treat him with care until his teammates prove 
they can hit. 
</P>
<P>
 A day to play hooky: Take the afternoon off on March 25. Capistrano Valley 
plays at Dana Hills in a South Coast League game. Zamora (UCLA) vs. Etherton 
(USC). The preseason's top two teams. Gosh, this could be fun. 
</P>
<P>
 They will play two more times, but the first meeting will set the tone. It 
could be epic. At the very least, it could kill an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring your own sunflower seeds. The Times Baseball Top 10 
</P>
<P>
 1. DANA HILLS The Dolphins have one of the county's top pitchers in Seth 
Etherton. They picked up another quality pitcher when Chris Toomey transferred 
from University. Dana Hills returns the middle of its defense -- catcher, 
shortstop, second base and center field. 
</P>
<P>
 2. CAPISTRANO VALLEY Will give the Dolphins a run for the league title. Pete 
Zamora is a notch below Etherton as a pitcher. The Cougars also picked up a 
second quality pitcher in Brandon Puffer, who sat out last season for 
disciplinary reasons. Six position players return. 
</P>
<P>
 3. EL DORADO Last season was an off year for the Golden Hawks and they missed 
the Southern Section Division I playoffs. But eight starters return, including 
three pitchers. Benito Flores was 8-3 last season. El Dorado will be the class 
of a very competitive Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
 4. TROY The Warriors return seven starters from a team that was 19-6 last 
season. Rick Parmenter finished 8-1 with 76 strikeouts. Brad Downing, Brian 
Logan and Nick Ruzzi are all solid hitting outfielders. The Warriors will test 
themselves in the Upper Deck tournament this year. 
</P>
<P>
 5. ORANGE Everyone, and that means everyone, is back. The Panthers were 
Century League co-champions, reached the quarterfinals of the Division II 
playoffs and could go farther this season. There is more pitching depth and 
experience everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 6. EDISON The Chargers finished second in the Sunset League last season and 
may improve a position this season. Todd Belitz gives them a mound ace. Jamie 
Surdock is a solid No. 2 starter when he's not playing shortstop. Two other 
starters return, plus four lettermen. 
</P>
<P>
 7. LAGUNA HILLS The Hawks return five position players and five, count 'em, 
five starting pitchers. Brett Nista is a quality player at shortstop. Casey 
Bennett is back at second base and Ron DiVito at third, so the infield is 
solid. All that is needed is one pitcher to step up and be the ace. 
</P>
<P>
 8. TUSTIN The Tillers, who won the Division III title, lost their top pitchers 
but should be among the top teams again. They return six starters, including 
the multitalented Derek Baker, and six other lettermen. If a couple of pitchers 
emerge, Tustin will be strong again. 
</P>
<P>
 9. FOUNTAIN VALLEY Sure, the Barons lost a lot. Brian Ponchak, their top 
pitcher and hitter, is at USC. But Fountain Valley won the Colt League World 
Series last summer, so the cupboard is not bare. Dave Hoppie returns at catcher 
and Daniel Keller is back at shortstop and will pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 10. MATER DEI The Monarchs a third-place team? Quite possibly, considering the 
county's top two teams are also in the South Coast League. But Mater Dei, as 
always, is loaded with talent. Erik Mattern returns at shortstop and Matt 
Treanor at catcher. Pitching, as always, is a question. 
</P>
<P>
 Others: Esperanza, Irvine, Katella, La Quinta, Los Alamitos, Marina, Santa Ana 
Valley.

MORE TESTING SCHEDULED FOR CSUN'S LOFTON

<P>
 The results of a battery of tests being performed on Cal State Northridge 
forward Brent Lofton showed that his heart is functioning "within normal limits 
for an athlete," a school spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofton, a senior, was held out of Northridge's basketball game against 
Southern Utah last week after complaining of chest pains and shortness of 
breath.He also will not play in tonight's game at San Diego State, the season 
finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary tests on his heart showed a potential abnormality, team doctors 
said. On Tuesday, Lofton underwent five hours of testing, including a treadmill 
test, and doctors were pleased by the results.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Barry Smith, the school's sports information director, said Lofton 
will not be released to play in tonight's game because doctors want him to 
complete an additional test that requires him to be hooked up to a heart 
monitor for 24 hours. 
</P>

 Lofton was unavailable for comment. MIKE HISERMAN

PREP BASEBALL '94: EMPIRE LEAGUE; MURRIETTA COMES BACK TO KEEP AZTECS TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Esperanza's Jason Murrietta looked down at his knee, which was swollen and 
sore, and the thought flashed through his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball."  
</P>
<P>
 Murrietta, a defensive back, injured his knee in the Aztecs' football game 
against Los Alamitos in November. He was hit on a punt return, causing a 
dislocated knee cap. 
</P>
<P>
 So there was Orange County's leading hitter flat on his back with his baseball 
career in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Murrietta was already gearing up for the struggle ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a few minutes, I calmed down," said Murrietta, a senior catcher. "I 
knew I would play." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knew it because they knew Murrietta. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it comes down to effort, Jason is always going to succeed," Aztec baseball 
Coach Mike Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrietta made the effort. The knee, fortunately, didn't need surgery. Still, 
it took time and effort before he could play again. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks of rehabilitation. Hours of swimming, weight lifting and riding a 
stationary bicycle. But by Christmas, Murrietta was again crouching behind the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason is a bulldog," Curran said. "He just works hard all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that work ethic that made Murrietta one of the most dangerous hitters 
in high school baseball last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit .565 during the regular season to lead the county. He reached base 18 
consecutive times during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrietta's bat and abilities as a catcher were a big reason the Aztecs won 
the Southern Section Division I championship. They beat Simi Valley, 3-0, in 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys like Jason win you championships," Curran said. "He's a great player and 
he's a leader. He shows others how to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Curran raves now, but he wasn't so sure about Murrietta as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out late because of basketball," Curran said. "He was this 5-foot-9 
kid who thought he was going to make the NBA. My freshman coach kept saying 
that this catcher Murrietta was really good. I thought, 'We'll see.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Curran saw, all right. He brought Murrietta up to the varsity as a sophomore 
because of injuries. Murrietta didn't waste any time, hitting a three-run homer 
in his first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrietta began in the outfield, but he was the team's starting catcher by the 
end of the season. He hit .237, but Curran liked more than just his physical 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason just isn't afraid," Curran said, "he plays the game like it's meant to 
be played." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: "I don't back down," Murrietta said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident last season during the Upper Deck tournament. Esperanza was 
playing Miami Westminster Christian, then ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA 
Today. A Westminster Christian player scored on a wild pitch and then spit on 
Murrietta, who had to be restrained by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost it a little," Murrietta said. "But I had a few words with them." 
</P>
<P>
 After the tournament, Esperanza won 16 consecutive games and the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game was a turning point for us," Curran said. "He showed us the 
attitude we had to have." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude will have to be on display more often this season. Murrietta is 
one of only two returning starters, and that could make him a marked man. Other 
teams probably will pitch around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think about leading the county in hitting again," Murrietta 
said. "That's all anyone ever asks me about. I just want to come through with 
runners on base. I want to produce runs. I want to do everything I can to help 
the team win." 
</P>
<P>
 And, if it comes down to effort, Murrietta will make it happen. Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, perennially one of Orange County's premier programs, rolled through 
league play and finished as the top-ranked team in the county. The Aztecs then 
stormed to the Division I championship. After losing the final two games of the 
Upper Deck tournament, the Aztecs won 16 in a row. They went into the playoffs 
unseeded, then routed Alhambra, Edison and Hesperia. In the semifinals, 
Esperanza defeated Encino Crespi, ranked second in the nation by USA Today, and 
in the final, defeated No. 1-ranked Simi Valley. "Maybe USA Today should take 
another look at their rankings," Coach Mike Curran said after the title game. 
Collegiate Baseball did, ranking the Aztecs second in the nation. Marcus Jones 
keyed the playoff drive. He won three playoff games and saved another. He shut 
out Simi Valley, 3-0, in the title game. Jones, who is playing at Long Beach 
State, finished 12-2. . . . Los Alamitos qualified for the playoffs for the 
first time since 1990. The Griffins were edged by Lakewood, 5-4, in the first 
round. . . . Cypress beat El Dorado in the league finale to qualify for the 
playoffs for the second consecutive season. In 1992, the Centurions upset No. 
2-seeded Huntington Beach in the first round. Last season, they weren't so 
fortunate, as they were bounced by Fontana, 13-1. . . . Esperanza's Jason 
Murrietta led the league and county in hitting with a .565 average. Freshman 
Bobby Brito of Cypress was second in both the league and county with a .542 
average. Jaret Wright of Katella hit .451 with a league-leading seven home 
runs. Brito led the league with 33 runs batted in. Poncho Ruiz of Esperanza hit 
.436 with five home runs and 28 RBIs. 1993 / IN REVIEW

FISCHER CLEARS 7-3 TO SET RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High, the runner-up in the high jump in last 
year's state track and field championships, cleared a Ventura County record 7 
feet 3 inches in a season opening meet against Ventura on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, a 5-foot-9 senior who has made a commitment to Wisconsin, cleared the 
height on his second attempt, then stopped jumping in order to conserve his 
energy for Saturday's Spartan Relays at Rio Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
 "His first attempt (at 7-3) was excellent, but he stalled out on top of the 
bar," Camarillo Coach Dennis Riedmiller said. "He knew he had it the second 
time, though. He was halfway over the bar and he yelled, 'Yeah!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer cleared 6-4 and 6-8 on his first attempts and 7 feet on his second 
after winning the long jump at 21-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 His 7-3 effort is the top high school mark in the nation this year and moves 
him into a tie for second on the all-time region list and into a tie for 13th 
on the all-time national list. Fischer and Ken Burke of Westlake (1985) 
previously shared the Ventura County record of 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Fischer and Eleazar Hernandez, winner of the 1,600 and 3,200 meters, 
Camarillo defeated Ventura, 76-61. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey Jay led Ventura with victories in the 100 (10.9 seconds), 200 (22.0) 
and 400 (49.7) meters. He also anchored the victorious 400 relay team (43.7).

HEBERT, WILSON PATIENTLY WAITING FOR BETTER DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Game No. 65 in the short life of the Mighty Ducks was a stinker, no question, 
but goaltender Guy Hebert could still manage a smile Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, today is a new day, a day to forget a 5-2 loss to the Montreal 
Canadiens and former teammate Ron Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
 "A loss is a loss," Hebert said. "I don't think we had a very good game 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no argument from Coach Ron Wilson, who was asked about the state of 
Hebert's goaltending since the Feb. 20 trade that sent Tugnutt to Montreal in 
exchange for forward Stephan Lebeau. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't very sharp tonight," Wilson said. "I'm not overly concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he paused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm concerned," Wilson continued. "He's gotta stop three or four of 
their goals." 
</P>
<P>
 In four starts since the trade, Hebert is 1-3 and has given up 16 goals. He 
went into Wednesday's game with a 2.88 goals-against average in 38 games. 
</P>
<P>
 It's March, a playoff berth is close at hand and every pass, every shot means 
so much more now. 
</P>
<P>
 A bad bounce here and a goal for the opposition, even if it happened to be the 
defending Stanley Cup champions, and the Ducks could miss out. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal's Brian Bellows scored through a screen in the first period. Ed Ronan 
fired a slap shot that somehow slipped through Hebert's pads and into the net 
in the second period. Mathieu Schneider slapped another shot through Hebert's 
legs in the third and Montreal had a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking of changing pads for a while," Hebert said, then realizing 
how that sounded, added, "I mean that's a sad excuse, but you know. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how a couple of those pucks got by me. I was in good position 
on all of them (the three soft goals). Both (through the legs shots) hit me 
solid. I saw the puck all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt's return surely meant more to Tugnutt and Lebeau, the former Canadien 
who played for the first time in Anaheim Arena. It was not a distraction for 
Hebert, however, and certainly no reason to fret over the result. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy where I am (in Anaheim)," Hebert said. "Maybe he won the 
battle tonight, but maybe I'll win the war." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick now is to focus on making the playoffs without cracking from the 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have accounted for the Ducks' flat offensive play against the 
Canadiens, Hebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe as a team we were squeezing the stick too tight," he said. "This is my 
first taste of playing on a team that was not expected to make the playoffs."

SWEET POTATOES: HOLD THE MARSHMALLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIE SIMMONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is only recently that I discovered how much I like sweet potatoes. For me, 
there are no happy childhood memories of the aroma of roasting sweet potatoes 
wafting from my mother's warm and cozy kitchen. My Italian-American mother 
prepared sweet potatoes just once a year -- for Thanksgiving dinner. I can 
still see them, topped with melted miniature marshmallows, brown sugar and 
pecans. I hated the way they looked and refused to eat them. 
</P>
<P>
 My appreciation for the sweet potato comes from my own kitchen -- and my 
personal quest to learn more about cooking with this gnarled, dead-looking, 
challenging and, ultimately, delectable tuber. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its "sweet" taste, a medium sweet potato contains only about 150 
calories -- comparable to the calories in a white potato. It is a superb source 
of Vitamin A and an excellent source of Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
 But what I love most is the sweet potato's versatility. I use it for soup or 
stew or serve it plain, either roasted, broiled or boiled. It is good cut into 
small pieces and added to risotto or pilaf. I cut up cooked sweet potatoes and 
add them to a frittata. They are even good in potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recipe below I take plain sweet potatoes, bake them whole and serve 
them split and filled with a mixture of black beans cooked with sweet red 
peppers, onion and spices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the oven is baking the sweet potatoes, bake some apples for dessert. 
Baste the apples with honey and bake until tender. They are especially good 
served warm, with the juices spooned over the tops. 
</P>
<P>
 BAKED SWEET POTATOES WITH BLACK BEANS AND VEGETABLES 
</P>
<P>
 4 large sweet potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chopped sweet red pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons chili powder 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 1 (14- to 15-ounce) can cut peeled tomatoes with juices 
</P>
<P>
 1 (15- to 16-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon minced, seeded jalapeno chile 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 lime wedges 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup plain low-fat yogurt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup cilantro leaves, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup thinly sliced green onion tops 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse sweet potatoes thoroughly, but do not peel. (Sweet potatoes darken very 
quickly once they are peeled.) Pierce with fork before baking to allow steam to 
vent. Place on foil-lined baking pan to catch juices. Bake at 350 degrees until 
tender when pierced with skewer or wooden pick, 40 to 60 minutes, depending on 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prepare black beans. Combine oil, sweet red pepper and onions in 
large skillet. Cook, stirring, until golden, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and 
cook 1 minute. Stir in chili powder and cumin along with tomatoes and beans. 
Bring to boil. Cover and cook over low heat 20 minutes. Stir in jalapenos. 
Season to taste with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, arrange 1 sweet potato on each dinner plate. Split potato open and 
mash slightly with fork. Spoon some black beans down center of each. Squeeze 
juice from lime wedge over each. Top with 1 spoonful yogurt. Sprinkle with 
cilantro and sliced green onions. Makes 4 servings. HONEY-BAKED APPLES 
</P>
<P>
 4 Golden Delicious apples 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 tablespoons raisins, dried currants or minced candied ginger 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons honey 
</P>
<P>
 Remove cores from apples with apple corer. Stand upright in baking dish. Cut 
butter into small pieces and stuff evenly into cored-out apples. Stuff some 
raisins into each cored-out apple. Drizzle tops with honey, dividing evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 In baking pan bake apples at 350 degrees, basting with pan juices every 15 
minutes until apples are tender, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly, basting with 
pan juices before serving. Makes 4 servings.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: BELL; LACK OF FUNDS MAY STALL WORK ON HISTORIC HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some say the James George Bell house is haunted. Others believe the 
118-year-old structure, once a brothel, is occupied by the city's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 These are myths surrounding the Victorian farmhouse built by the city's 
founder on a 350-acre ranch that is now the heart of Bell. But it's no myth 
that attempts to restore the inside of the home are threatened by a lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historic things are always put on hold when you have a tight fiscal concern," 
said Annette Peretz, director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to finance $250,000 to restore the landmark's interior to its original 
state, the City Council voted last summer to put restoration plans on hold. 
Officials agree the house's fate may remain in limbo as long as two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rolf Janssen said the council's decision was based on the fact that 
property tax revenue is declining and fewer funds are trickling down to Bell 
from Sacramento. Community Development Block Grant funds cannot be tapped 
because the city has not registered the house with the state Office of Historic 
Preservation as a historic building, Peretz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city purchased the house for $18,000 in 1968. Efforts to refurbish it 
began in 1989 when it was moved from Lucille Avenue to the Civic Center. The 
landmark had been taken from its original location at California and Gage 
avenues to Lucille Avenue about 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 Janssen said the home's latest location has restored its significance as a 
landmark: "This house has helped to create a sense of community. We want people 
to understand we are a distinct city that was created by a family with a lot of 
history in Southern California." JENNIFER OLDHAM

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY, BUILDER SETTLE SUIT OVER ENERGY PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council agreed Tuesday to accept a $16-million settlement from the 
builder and the operator of a city refuse-to-energy plant to resolve a lengthy 
legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Pittsburgh-based Dravo Corp. agreed to pay the city $6 
million now and another $4 million in monthly payments over several years.The 
plant's operator, Montenay Pacific Power Corp., agreed to make $6 million in 
additional repairs to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Dravo also agreed to dismiss a countersuit seeking $17 million in unpaid bills 
for the construction project. A federal judge must approve terms of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach sued Dravo in 1989, contending the city was losing millions of 
dollars a year because the plant, which began operation in 1988, was not 
producing enough energy. Long Beach sought damages of $49 million for alleged 
design and construction problems. JOHN POPE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has ordered an environmental study before deciding whether a 
controversial two-story mausoleum should be built at Resurrection Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Commission previously approved a request by the Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles to build the mausoleum. But residents, many from 
neighboring Monterey Park, contended the structure would clash with the 
graveyard's park-like setting, block homeowners' views and attract graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park City Council members last year asked for a review of the 
church's plans after hundreds of residents signed a petition opposing the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is scheduled to be finished at the end of July and will be paid for 
by the archdiocese. PSYCHE PASCUAL

EXPIRATION OF SEIZURE LAW STYMIES POLICE; FINANCES: NARCOTICS OFFICERS AND 
PROSECUTORS STRUGGLE TO OPERATE WITHOUT A VALUABLE -- AND PROFITABLE -- TOOL. 
NEW LEGISLATION IS IN LIMBO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Area law enforcement officials are grappling with the loss of a powerful tool 
and lucrative source of income -- the state's asset forfeiture law, which 
expired Jan. 1. No longer can they routinely seize cash and other property from 
alleged drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years the sale of confiscated assets tied to drug trafficking 
generated about $155 million in the state, including nearly $2 million in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 While the legislature considers new forfeiture proposals, police agencies and 
prosecutors remain stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Doug Storm heads the 30-member Orange County sheriff's narcotics team 
that recently found 2,000 pounds of cocaine in a raid at a Cerritos home. About 
$3 million in cash that the task force seized during raids is frozen in a bank 
account while the law is in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 forfeiture hearings and trials have been put on hold. "It's a 
complete mess," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard de la Sota, who handles 
forfeiture cases for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking away forfeiture laws means "a setback to our efforts to stop drug 
trafficking," said Sharon Diggs-Jackson, analyst for the Long Beach Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale of confiscated property have paid for training and 
equipment for narcotics officers and drug education programs, she said. The 
department has purchased a helicopter and has put about 10 confiscated cars and 
trucks into service. 
</P>
<P>
 Local police agencies were able to keep 76.5% of the proceeds from confiscated 
property under the old law. The rest was divided between local district 
attorneys offices and the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical forfeiture case involves cash, cars and telephones, Diggs-Jackson 
said. Long Beach police also have seized boats, motorcycles, stocks and bonds, 
personal watercraft vehicles, jewelry, high-tech weapons and even small 
airplanes. Also, Diggs-Jackson said, police have routinely confiscated items 
used in the drug trade, such as scales and money-counting machines. 
</P>
<P>
 New legislation has been held up because of a dispute over how strong the 
forfeiture laws should be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly approved a bill that would provide more safeguards for innocent 
owners of confiscated property. The Senate approved a bill similar to the law 
that just expired. A conference committee will try to resolve the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, contend the 
recently expired law was too tough. That law, which was passed in 1989, allowed 
police to seize items that were believed to be connected or traceable to a 
drug-related transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 law "put the burden of proof on the person," ACLU attorney Alin Friel 
said. "All the government needs is some element of probable cause, some 
informant who's never named, to implicate a house or car." The "probable cause" 
might also be otherwise inadmissible hearsay evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous law, which had passed in 1988, required a criminal conviction 
before any property could be seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU favors legislation similar to the 1988 version. Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), who helped draft the tougher 1989 law, favors reinstating the 
1989 version with minor revisions.

DISTRICT PUTS SUPERINTENDENT ON LEAVE, OKS TENTATIVE TEACHER PACT; SCHOOLS: NO 
EXPLANATION IS GIVEN, BUT LARRY L. LUCAS HAD REJECTED A BOARD REQUEST TO LEAVE 
A MONTH AGO.

<P>
 The ABC Unified District school board, in an unexpected move Tuesday night, 
put embattled Supt. Larry L. Lucas on paid leave indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Cecy Groom announced the move after the board emerged from a 
lengthy closed session. Lucas left the district's headquarters before the 
announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Supt. Ira Toibin was named to replace Lucas until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom offered no explanation for the move, but the superintendent and board 
have been on a collision course since a new board majority, backed by the 
teachers union, gained control in November during an 11-day teachers strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members had asked Lucas privately to leave about a month ago, but 
he refused, according to his attorney, David C. Larsen. Lucas referred all 
inquiries Wednesday to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's committed to the district," Larsen said. "He's demonstrated that by his 
past leadership."

 Lucas has headed the district since 1988. In July, the school board voted to 
extend his contract another year to June, 1997, and to increase his pay by 
about $1,000 to $109,168. Last month, however, the new board majority removed a 
clause in the superintendent's contract that provides for an automatic contract 
extension every year.  
</P>
<P>
 The new majority also tore up the contract that the board had imposed on 
teachers last fall. The new majority tentatively approved a pact that includes 
bonus pay for teachers, who had taken a 1.5% pay cut under the old contract, 
and restores smaller class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the pact said teachers deserve the improved terms and that 
students also will benefit. But critics, including three of seven school board 
members and top district administrators, called the proposed contract a 
potential budget-buster.  
</P>
<P>
 The tentative contract with the union includes a onetime 1% bonus, adds a paid 
planning day for teachers and rolls back class sizes to last year's levels. 
Teachers have already overwhelmingly ratified it and board members are 
scheduled to vote on the pact March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial consultant has determined that the district could face a 
$3.3-million deficit by June, 1995, if the school board approves the proposed 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If that estimate is correct, the board will have to authorize deep cuts in 
programs, including employee layoffs, to avoid bankruptcy, district officials 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have begun work on a list of potential cuts to present to the 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The district hired the Los Angeles office of the New York-based accounting 
firm Coopers & Lybrand to determine what the district could afford in contract 
concessions to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The district "gave too much money away in contract negotiations," board member 
Dixie Primosch said.  
</P>
<P>
 Groom and other board members recently said they suspect the analysis is too 
grim, but were not specific about how harmful budget cuts could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's probably enough money to pay for the contract," board member 
Sally Morales Havice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have blamed Lucas for the lingering bitterness over the strike last 
fall, and they say he is responsible for the gloomy financial predictions 
contained in the consultant's report. One union official said teachers are 
pleased Lucas has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be a sigh of relief," said Don Saul, co-president of the 
ABC Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Primosch, who has consistently supported Lucas, said the superintendent should 
have been praised, not punished, for raising academic standards and outlining 
goals for the district.

A NEW COURSE OF ACTION; MARY BUTLER SCHOOL USES THE ARTS AS A FOUNDATION FOR 
ACADEMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a working mother who wanted her daughter to attend a good school and also 
get dance and music lessons, Leslie Curtis-Moore found herself constantly 
juggling a hectic schedule. She also shelled out $375 a month for private 
school tuition, musical instrument rentals, clarinet lessons and ballet 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she enrolled her 10-year-old daughter, Tiffany, in Mary Butler School, a 
new Long Beach public school billed as a center for creative and performing 
arts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect (Tiffany) to dance the ballet, or play in a symphony 
orchestra," Curtis-Moore said. "But she's getting a broad exposure to the arts 
. . . without the stress (and cost) of all the rushing around." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators say that only a few of the 750 students are likely to become 
artists and performers. The goal is to use an arts education to make students 
art lovers as well as more successful, well-rounded adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, which serves grades three through eight, has two indoor theaters, 
an outdoor theater, a video recording studio and an animation laboratory. There 
are 20 pianos, music synthesizers and computers with music-related software. 
</P>
<P>
 Course offerings, which are taught in three-month blocks, include cartooning, 
country dance and instrument-making. Some classes have a less obvious link to 
the arts than others. In a beginning sewing class, for example, students learn 
fashion and costume design. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, students can choose from 24 electives. The classes take place during a 
50-minute afternoon period. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, students attend required academic classes, in which teachers 
make a particular effort to integrate the arts, said Principal Judi McEachen. 
</P>
<P>
 In one class, for example, students fashioned African masks to the sounds of 
recorded drum beats as a supplement to their study of African tribal history. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is not a real-life incarnation of the television series "Fame," 
where students at a performing arts high school devoted themselves almost 
entirely to sweat-drenched, painstaking rehearsals to shape themselves into 
professional performers. In fact, students who opt for only sports electives 
could graduate without ever taking an art class. 
</P>
<P>
 But all students receive exposure to the arts through field trips to such 
locations as the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for 
concerts. The school also teaches students "about being good audiences and 
appreciative of what's going on," said school district spokesman Dick Van Der 
Laan. 
</P>
<P>
 One such student is eighth-grader Paya Laerdonn, 14, who lives near the 
school. He said that although he usually prefers taking basketball and 
volleyball electives rather than art, he was planning to enroll in a video 
production class. He admitted being "a little" more appreciative of music and 
theater since coming to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school stages performances every three months, which appeals to Adam 
Osoro, an eighth-grader who took part in a one-act play. Osoro said he fell in 
love with acting about five years ago and enjoys pursuing his career goal at 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Thomas, who oversees the school's curriculum planning, said that 
participation in the arts should give students greater self-esteem and better 
presentation and communications techniques, as well as enhanced performance 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen that students who participate in the arts learn better and have 
longer-lasting learning," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Butler School, which was formally dedicated in October, is named for a 
community leader and parent activist who died in 1986. Butler, a mother of 
eight, worked for more than 40 years to improve schools and ease community 
racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The state provided about $6.5 million from bonds to pay for school 
construction and some equipment. A $365,000 federal grant helped pay for its 
indoor theater-in-the-round. A state grant of about $10,000 was used to 
purchase music and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations and arts organizations have funded field trips, sent guest 
speakers and helped create arts-related lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "District after district has made cuts to arts during these lean budget 
times," said Van Der Laan. "(This campus) is a rare exception to a disturbing 
trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Students from throughout the district can apply to attend Butler. The school, 
at 1400 E. 20th St., also draws from the surrounding neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 About 20 students enrolled in Butler in September after leaving private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is a mathematician and I believe in the value of art, dance and 
drama," said Curtis-Moore, whose daughter attended Long Beach Brethren before 
transferring. "Now we both have what we wanted."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; REVISED WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a revised plan for a $557-million tourist harbor 
and aquarium that drops a proposed cruise ship terminal and adds more open land 
and playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended to link downtown with the shoreline and attract more visitors, the 
Queensway Bay project calls for a major redevelopment of the downtown 
waterfront, mostly on an old landfill where the Shoreline Aquatic Park and 
lagoon are located. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed development would excavate nearly half of the park -- to be 
replaced with other greenbelts -- and dredge the lagoon to accommodate tall 
ships, dinner cruise vessels and fishing charter ships. The lagoon would be 
surrounded by shops, restaurants, hotels and an aquarium that is considered to 
be the linchpin of the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the bay, a 478-slip marina and outdoor amphitheater would be built 
between the Queen Mary and the TraveLodge hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's vote authorizes city officials to conduct an environmental review 
and explore funding options for the ambitious project. Long Beach will pay 
$124.9 million for such items as roadway improvements and parking lots. The 
Port of Long Beach will pay $41.8 million to build the marina, and the 
remaining $390.3 million is expected to come from private investors and 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials predict that the completed development would pump $275 
million into the local economy and create 3,500 jobs. JOHN POPE

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; QUEEN MARY POSTS LOSS OF $4.2 MILLION IN 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Queen Mary lost $4.2 million in 1993, with only one profitable month in 
the first year of operation under new management. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the RMS Foundation, headed by Joseph F. Prevratil, attributed 
the loss mainly to start-up costs and said December, 1993, earnings of $33,420 
indicated a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevratil said he expected to lose money the first year. RMS spent $3 million 
initially to reopen and refurbish the city's best-known landmark after the 
former operators, The Walt Disney Co., left in 1992. RMS, a nonprofit 
management group, took over the ship last February and began full tourism and 
hotel operations in June. The Queen Mary employs 550 people and will add 200 
jobs in the summer, Prevratil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year about 760,000 people visited the attraction. RMS paid about $223,000 
in hotel bed taxes and made about $221,000 in lease payments to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel currently has a 38% occupancy rate, Prevratil said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; FESTIVAL SPONSORS SETTLE DISPUTE WITH HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sponsors of an authors' festival that was canceled in the wake of problems 
with hotel reservations have settled their dispute with the Long Beach Sheraton 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary Women, which has sponsored the festival for 12 years, recently 
announced the settlement with the hotel's parent corporation, ITT 
Sheraton.Neither side would reveal terms of the agreement, but it is unlikely 
that the Festival of Authors will be rescheduled this year, said Charlotte 
Goforth, president of Literary Women. The 600 tickets sold for this year's 
festival will be refunded, Goforth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 5 event was canceled after the organization discovered that the hotel 
had booked the festival and a corporate meeting for the same date in the 
hotel's main ballroom and meeting rooms. The hotel chose to honor the corporate 
booking, Goforth said. Literary Women then threatened to sue the hotel.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; SHADOWLANDS OF ART ALONG THE SHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parking meters and light posts will be sprouting some strange shadows in 
the next few months along the sidewalks of Belmont Shore's main business 
arterial.  
</P>
<P>
 There'll be stained sunglasses, herons, palm trees, sea gulls and egrets over 
14 blocks along 2nd Street.The creations, by artist and educator Craig Cree 
Stone, are part of "Shadows Casting on the Shore," a $50,000 public arts 
project commissioned as the final stage of a $2.9-million street-widening. 
Stone also will produce 20 images on boulders along the street's median. The 
arts project will be funded by parking meter revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, who teaches in the American Indian Studies and Art departments at Cal 
State Long Beach, was selected by a public arts panel and confirmed by a 
commission consisting mostly of Belmont Shore residents. The arts project is 
expected to be completed by next fall.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; BOARD COMPLIES WITH SCHOOL CHOICE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Long Beach school board, complying with a state mandate, approved a plan 
Tuesday that will allow parents some latitude in choosing their children's 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for open enrollment for students throughout the district, but 
contains several restrictions that will limit choices, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, students can apply until April 22 to attend any school in the 
district through the 1994-95 school year. But the transfer could be denied if 
it would create a racial imbalance in a school's enrollment.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, most Long Beach schools are filled to capacity, and children who 
live in the neighborhood will have first priority to attend their local school. 
</P>
<P>
 No extra transportation will be provided by the district, officials said.

COVER STORY; THEY'RE CLEANING UP IN COURT; NEIGHBORS SUE LANDLORDS TO GET RID 
OF DRUG DEALERS AND TROUBLEMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She is an unlikely savior, an unemployed accountant leading a grass-roots 
crusade against drug dealers and their hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of crunching numbers, Betsy Bredau spends her days teaching frightened 
residents how to reclaim their streets. Neighborhood block captains revere her. 
Long Beach politicians refer constituents to her. Police chiefs in other cities 
want to pick her brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Her message is simple: It's up to property owners to get rid of drug dealers 
and other troublemakers. If they don't, neighbors will take those owners to 
court and probably win thousands of dollars in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as Bredau's fight to clean up a drug-infested duplex on her street 
has ballooned neighborhood-by-neighborhood into a new war on drugs in Long 
Beach. In eight months, she has helped residents win more than $53,000 in 
judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, just the threat of a lawsuit has prompted owners to act, 
neighborhood leaders say. At least 13 landlords have voluntarily fixed up their 
buildings or evicted problem tenants after Bredau contacted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some landlords complain they are being punished for a problem that is beyond 
their control. But police say Bredau has found an effective way to clean up 
trouble in neighborhoods. Community groups that have worked with her say they 
see results in weeks, a fraction of the time it can take the city to clean up 
buildings with suspected drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's made certain blocks in the city safer," said Lt. Don First, who is in 
charge of community policing for the Long Beach Police Department's south 
division. "To my way of thinking, she has accomplished a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau gets landlords' attention by hitting them where they are most 
vulnerable -- in the pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in a neighborhood near Bixby Park recently won $25,000 after a judge 
concluded that the owner of a building at 465 Almond Ave. had ignored 
complaints about frequent gunfire and people openly drinking and smoking 
marijuana, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen DeYoung, who lives next door to the two-story apartment building with 
wrought-iron bars over the windows, said she frequently cleared hypodermic 
needles and used condoms from her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the landlord, Bunrith Lor, ignored their complaints. Frequent 
visits by police also failed to deter the criminal activity, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 They sought help from City Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal, who referred them to 
Bredau. She told the group to keep detailed logs of incidents at the building 
for at least a week. The residents documented several incidents, including 
shots fired and suspected gang members loitering in front of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau sent Lor a stern letter asking that he hire a security guard and get 
rid of problem tenants, even if it meant paying them to leave. When Lor did not 
respond, the residents took him to Small Claims Court, alleging that the 
incidents had created a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our situation was so dangerous that we knew we were heading for a (deadly) 
shooting," said DeYoung, 41, who sent her 17-year-old son to live with 
relatives in Arizona for two months last summer. "It was either get help or go 
to one of our own funerals." 
</P>
<P>
 Lor, who lives in Cypress, said he could not afford to meet the group's 
demands, but that he has been evicting problem tenants since he took over the 
building last May. He also said he cannot afford to pay the judgment, and has 
appealed. Nevertheless, Lor and the community agree that much of the trouble 
has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau's approach is patterned after a program developed five years ago by an 
Oakland resident.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to take property owners to Small Claims Court, where it costs 
just $15 to file suit, cases are heard within 30 days and individual judgments 
can reach $5,000. Several residents could file suit, increasing the potential 
amount of awards. Litigants may not be represented by an attorney unless the 
case is appealed to Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakland and other cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, resident groups 
have won more than $760,000 in judgments since 1989, said Molly Wetzel, founder 
of Safe Streets Now!, the organization that pioneered the strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 Bredau read about Wetzel's group in a newspaper article while experiencing 
problems in her neighborhood near Bixby Park about two years ago. Cars cruised 
the street at all hours, stopping at a run-down duplex across from Bredau's 
Rose Avenue house. Strangers milled around -- drinking, fighting, yelling at 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Bredau, who lives with six cats and two dogs, had complained to 
the property owner, but he ignored her pleas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She frequently called police, who made two drug-related arrests. She even 
confronted the strangers, who threatened her and heaved bricks through her 
windows in the middle of the night, she said. She keeps photos of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau, 41, said she refused to move from her three-bedroom house because she 
liked the neighborhood of single-family homes, just four blocks from the ocean. 
So she and two neighbors decided to sue the owner, alleging that conditions at 
the property created a public nuisance. Bredau had no legal experience and did 
not consult a lawyer. She prepared by following a summary of a case Wetzel had 
filed against an Oakland property owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau and the neighbors were each awarded $1,000. And about two months after 
the court hearing, the problem tenants were evicted, Bredau said. Soon, 
children began to ride their bikes down the alley where cars once cruised at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful sense that we had new power," recalled Bredau, who said 
there have been no more problems. "We finally had a forum for complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 The property owner, Galileo E. Dacer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Bredau's success has spread through the Southeast area. She said she 
receives about five inquiries a day. Compton Police Chief Hourie Taylor invited 
Bredau to speak at a recent meeting of area law enforcement officials from his 
department, Montebello, South Gate, Bell Gardens and Lynwood. Taylor said he 
plans to try the strategy in Compton neighborhoods where drug activity has 
taken root. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears very expeditious," Taylor said of the approach. "Not only (will) 
the police get involved (by training residents), but it requires the 
involvement of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau, who was laid off in August from her accounting job at Lockheed, now 
works full time helping others reclaim their neighborhoods. She pays her bills 
with severance money and loans from relatives. She also is seeking a $20,000 
grant from the city Community Development Department to continue the work.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every other block has one of these pent-up problems," she said. 
Long Beach authorities and city officials see the approach as a new community 
policing tool in neighborhoods where police raids and other measures have 
failed to put an end to illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say it can take months, if not years, to force property owners to 
deal with problem tenants. Under state law, landlords who don't rid their 
buildings of drug problems can be barred from renting for up to a year. But 
police must document drug-related activity at a property. The process is often 
prolonged because residents are reluctant to contact police for fear of 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, residents who use Bredau's approach do not have to cite specific 
drug-related activity. They simply document "nuisance activities" such as loud 
parties, public drinking or loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-five times out of 100 it is drug-related," Bredau said. "The constant 
traffic in and out of the property and frequent loud arguments are the dead 
giveaways that they are selling drugs there." 
</P>

 Officials say Bredau's approach also has triggered more sweeping neighborhood 
cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the area around George Washington Middle School, northwest of downtown, 
apartment building owners, managers and tenants have gotten more involved since 
Bredau helped them clean up a notorious complex that had 26 drug arrests over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 One manager has installed caged lights at the back of a building to illuminate 
the alley. Others have painted addresses on building facades to help police 
respond to calls. One tenant painted the address of her building in 5-foot-long 
white numbers on the roof so police helicopters can see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a changed attitude," said resident Faith Palermo. "It shamed us that 
we had drug-dealing families right across from the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Many landlords say they recognize their responsibility to maintain rental 
properties, but contend they should not be required to take on the role of the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 They also complain that they sometimes are unfairly blamed for problems that 
have several sources. In a recent Long Beach case, a Municipal Court 
commissioner declined to penalize a landlord accused of ignoring drug dealing 
and other incidents at his central-area apartment building. After touring the 
neighborhood, Commissioner Jeffery P. Castner concluded that patrons at a 
corner bar also could have been contributing to the problems. Neighbors said 
the owner and employees of the bar have begun attending Neighborhood Watch 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some landlords have complained that Bredau's approach is too confrontational 
and that their efforts to clear up a problem are overlooked by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I was being mistreated," said Rick Hamblin, a North Long Beach 
property owner who was threatened with a lawsuit. Neighbors said gang members 
were visiting property Hamblin owns on East 68th Street and threatening 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin denies that the visitors were gang members. He said neighbors were 
overreacting to a parking problem in the alley behind his property. He said 
friends and relatives of a disabled couple double-parked in the alley during 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "My side wasn't even taken into consideration," he said. "The first thing 
(they) said was, 'We're gonna sue you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin said he eventually asked the tenants to leave after they did not pay 
the rent on time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Landlord representatives question the motives of some residents who decide to 
sue. "Is the point to reclaim our neighborhoods, or is the point to put some 
freebie money out there to a bunch of disgruntled tenants?" asked Nancy 
Ahlswede, executive vice president of the Apartment Assn., California Southern 
Cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Ahlswede said residents aren't aware of the pressures on owners, who are often 
denied loans to improve buildings in crime-ridden areas and fear retaliation if 
they try to evict problem tenants. Most landlords will work with resident 
associations if approached in a non-threatening way, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But some apartment building owners endorse Bredau's strategy. Tony Vigil, for 
example, said that as a result of Bredau's efforts, the neighborhood around 
Washington Middle School will be safer for his tenants, ultimately increasing 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest thing that's come here in years," said Vigil, 37. 
"They're putting pressure on other owners to shape up or ship out." Reclaiming 
Neighborhoods

ENTERTAINMENT; 'TWICE AROUND' IS TV-THIN BOTH TIMES 
</P>

 As time goes on, the two one-act sitcoms that make up playwright Murray 
Schisgal's "Twice Around the Park" look more and more as though they belong on 
television. Indeed, avid TV watchers should get a big kick out of them. But 
they're one-joke pieces, way too thin to sustain an evening of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Long Beach Studio, director J.D. Reichelderfer milks all the laughs 
Schisgal has provided. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Need for Brussels Sprouts," out-of-work actor Leon Rose is practicing 
his lip-syncing of an operatic aria for an upcoming commercial audition. When 
his screeching gets too loud, there's a violent banging on his door, announcing 
the arrival of Margaret Heinz, a police officer ready to write him a ticket for 
noise pollution. Of course, Margaret is -- in accordance with sitcom rules -- 
also the upstairs tenant. Anger is subdued, the two discover they're both 
recovering from disastrous marriages, and Cupid flies over, leaving his calling 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Need for Less Expertise," Gus and Edie Frazier attempt to follow an 
ersatz Eastern audiotape detailing exercises and rituals to help them realize 
the fullness of their marriage which, after 26 years, is faltering. The 
dialogue is right out of "The Bickersons" and the couple's eventual 
compatibility is brought about in as silly and pat a manner as is Leon Rose's 
with his upstairs neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the estimable Holgie Forrester, as both Margaret and Edie, can't keep it 
all from looking as if there should be a commercial between the two episodes. 
Unfortunately, in an effort to save the day, she stoops to mugging and vocal 
tricks. Roger Galloway -- fluffy-haired and bug-eyed as Leon, and 
plastered-down, mustached and puckered as Gus -- depends even more on mugging 
to punctuate the laughs. When he forgets the gimmicks, he can be very funny. 
Both actors look as though they're filling time between more interesting 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the lighting operator seemed, at the performance reviewed, to be dreaming 
of better things to come -- switching the house lights off, then turning the 
stage work lights on along with the stage lighting, turning off the stage 
lighting, then turning off the work lights, then turning the house lights back 
on, causing one member of the audience to ask, "Is it intermission already?" 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe that was just Reichelderfer's attempt to breathe another laugh into a 
shallow evening. 
</P>

 Two Southeast-Long Beach girls' basketball teams will attempt to defend their 
Southern Section championships Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood will try to defend its title in Division I-AA and Valley Christian in 
Division IV-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked No. 1 in the state by Cal-Hi Sports News, Lynwood (28-1) will meet 
Peninsula (24-3) in the I-AA final at 8:30 p.m. Valley Christian (25-2) plays 
Village Christian (24-1) in the IV-A final at 6:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood defeated Capistrano Valley, 58-41, in the I-AA title game last season 
and beat San Francisco Balboa, 65-51, in the state final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights have been lead by forward Timicha Kirby and guard Tawana Grimes. 
Kirby finished with 15 points and nine rebounds to lead Lynwood to a 52-32 win 
over Diamond Bar in the I-AA semifinals last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opponent, second-seeded Peninsula, is no stranger to championship games, 
having won the state Division I title in 1992. The Panthers are led by guard 
Mimi McKinney, who had 20 points and seven rebounds in her team's 60-38 win 
over San Gabriel in the I-AA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the third consecutive season that Valley Christian has advanced to 
a Southern Section final. The top-seeded Crusaders advanced to the Division 
IV-A final behind junior forward Jodi Parriott, who has scored 55 points in the 
past two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opponent, second-seeded Village Christian, advanced to the final with a 
68-58 win over Bell-Jeff last week. It will be Village Christian's first 
appearance in a Southern Section final. END OF THE ROAD 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State men's basketball team, in a five-way battle for second 
place in the Big West Conference, will complete its regular season when it 
plays conference games at Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (15-9, 9-7 in the Big West) will play Fullerton at 8:30 tonight and 
Irvine at 8:30 p.m. Saturday. Long Beach is in a three-way tie for fourth place 
with San Jose State and Nevada Las Vegas, one-half game behind Utah State 
(10-7) and one game behind Pacific (10-6). New Mexico State leads the Big West 
at 11-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach defeated Fullerton and Irvine in the first meeting between the 
teams in January. The 49ers had their highest point total of the season in a 
111-106 overtime win over Irvine and defeated Fullerton, 91-69. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton and Irvine also occupy the bottom of the conference standings. 
Fullerton is 5-11 and Irvine 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers split their final two home games last week, surprising New Mexico 
State, 84-83, and losing to UNLV, 74-70. Long Beach defeated New Mexico State 
behind 25 points by guard Rod Hannibal and 21 by forward Mike Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson, a 6-foot-7 junior, is the team's leading scorer with a 15.8-point 
average and Hannibal is second at 15.6 points. The 49ers will try to improve 
their position for the conference tournament that starts March 11 at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach starting point guard Jeff Rogers, who averaged 5.9 points and 3.1 
assists, left the team last week for personal reasons. PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 The Glenn High wrestling team, which won its second consecutive Southern 
Section dual meet title last week, had three of its wrestlers qualify for the 
state championship tournament Friday and Saturday at the University of 
Pacific's A.G. Spanos Center in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Granillo has qualified in the 189-pound classification along with Hector 
Ramirez in the 160-pound division and Miguel Soto at 119 pounds. Granillo was 
the only Southeast-Long Beach wrestler to win his division at the Masters state 
qualifying tournament at Fountain Valley High last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez advanced by finishing fourth at 160 pounds in the tournament and Soto 
was eighth at 119 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 All three also won matches in their team's 32-27 win over Mira Costa in the 
Division IV dual meet championship at Mira Costa last week, Granillo and Soto 
winning with pins. It was Granillo's pin of Mira Costa's Donny Montiel that 
clinched the title for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Granillo, Rudolph James of Long Beach Poly and Greg Ford of 
Whittier were the only other area wrestlers to reach their division final at 
the Masters tournament.

 Even on days when the Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe Museum in Montebello is closed 
to outsiders, a gray-haired man walks across its creaking wooden floors as if 
he owns it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Sanchez stops in front of a glass case that displays a sword.He draws 
water from a spigot in the yard, and sits in the salon built more than a 
century ago, when most of California was still owned by Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, 73, a grandson of Matias Sanchez, is one of three descendants who 
leads tours at the adobe and tells family stories. His cousins, Eleanor Zuniga, 
80, and James Jeffredo, 86, often join him. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who come here would rather go on a tour with a family member because 
they have anecdotes we don't have," said Lee Gardipe, president of the 
Montebello Historical Society, which operates the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardipe said the society is trying to get the family's stories down on paper 
so local schoolchildren will have written histories. Zuniga and Jeffredo, 
Sanchez's oldest living descendants, have vivid memories of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuniga remembers fruit trees circling the homestead, which is now surrounded 
by houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born on the east side of this house," Jeffredo said as he sat in an 
office that was once a bedroom. "I used to plant corn, potatoes and squash." 
</P>
<P>
 The original house was built in 1845 by Dona Maria Casilada Soto de Lobo.

 Despite years of increasingly pointed warnings and mounting legal challenges, 
sexual harassment at the Los Angeles Police Department remains an entrenched 
and serious problem, according to documents and numerous police officials who 
say there is a climate of hostility toward women that has until recently gone 
virtually unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records, internal police documents and interviews with police officers, 
supervisors and department critics reveal a number of cases of alleged 
harassment: from a sexually explicit computer program left in the terminals of 
female officers, to supervisors who press subordinates for dates, to three 
pending lawsuits involving claims that officers raped colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment of female officers takes on additional urgency because the 
department's top leaders believe women, who generally get high marks for 
avoiding excessive-force complaints, are a key component of the LAPD's 
much-vaunted plan to bring community-based policing to the city. Moreover, the 
LAPD is vigorously trying to hire more female officers to satisfy legal 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment is not unique to the LAPD, which like many organizations is 
trying to come to terms with new and sometimes misunderstood definitions of the 
practice. Some male officers, especially longtime veterans, say they feel that 
the rules have been changed in the middle of the game -- that they suddenly are 
being threatened with punishment for conduct that would have been laughed about 
just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to expect that when you go from one culture to another, from 
all-male to a mixture, that you're going to have some difficulties," said Judy 
Rosener, a professor at the UC Irvine graduate school of management. "We're 
playing new roles, but we don't have new rules. A lot of police officers don't 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League has looked at the issue from both sides, 
representing in separate cases men accused of sexual harassment and women 
complaining of it. "In a male-dominated profession, there was not enough 
education in preparation for women coming into the ranks. . . . That has 
created some problems, but we're talking about a small percentage of our 
officers," said the union's president, Danny L. Staggs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the LAPD attempts to tackle the problem, many credit Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams with taking important steps in the right direction. They are 
particularly heartened by the chief's decision to authorize a sweeping sexual 
harassment audit at the LAPD's West Los Angeles station, some details of which 
were first reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very clear that this administration without any shadow of a doubt 
is going to create a different environment for women in this department," 
Williams said Wednesday. "If a senior manager stands in the way . . . they're 
going to be gone. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such comments -- Williams' strongest public pronouncements on the 
subject -- some women officers and their advocates worry that it could take 
years for his efforts to yield tangible results. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum, who has enthusiastically backed 
Williams' attempts to attack harassment in the ranks, said it may take time to 
change the attitudes of a relatively small but entrenched number of officers 
who have yet to comprehend the importance of the issue. But he stressed that 
Williams has begun to turn the department around. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the LAPD is wrestling with dozens of complaints. According to 
public files and internal documents obtained by The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the past five years, there have been at least eight cases of female LAPD 
employees alleging that they were sexually assaulted by co-workers. There have 
been no criminal prosecutions. Three incidents are the subject of current 
Internal Affairs investigations. Three others are the subject of pending 
lawsuits: In one case the accused officer was fired after an in-house hearing, 
while the other two suits were filed after the accused officers were cleared by 
internal disciplinary boards. In another case, an officer was allowed to resign 
before the case was adjudicated internally. Still another resulted in a 1990 
lawsuit that was settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 * The LAPD logged 43 "gender-related personnel complaints" against police 
officers last year. Five were alleged assaults, four involved "inappropriate 
pictures/photos/video," and seven involved touching. In 25 cases, officers were 
accused of making inappropriate comments and in two cases officers were accused 
of both touching and commenting inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two studies, commissioned by the department in 1987, found widespread 
complaints among female officers about harassment and discrimination -- 
although the Christopher Commission determined that the LAPD had not followed 
up on those findings four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite reports calling attention to the problem, until last year the LAPD 
never compiled records of sexual harassment cases. Instead, the cases were 
included with other allegations under broad headings such as conduct unbecoming 
an officer. "I'm not willing to say (the data) was purposely buried, but 
certainly nobody cared to keep track," said City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, 
who chairs the council's Personnel Committee. "It was not important enough. 
That is what it tells me." 
</P>
<P>
 * In the last several years, the city of Los Angeles has spent more than 
$400,000 settling 11 sexual harassment cases -- six involving the LAPD. Another 
dozen or so cases are pending and at least three major law firms have notified 
the city that they intend to file additional sexual harassment lawsuits against 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 1,100 women officers on the department -- about 15% of the 
7,600 total. Some critics of department attitudes say harassment will not be 
erased until the number of women in the department comes closer to the 44% in 
the general work force. 
</P>
<P>
 As troubling as the harassment, according to many female officers, is the 
LAPD's historic indifference to the problem. Although the department began 
accepting female police officers in 1973 and has made steady gains in the 
number of women officers since then, commissions and studies from the late 
1980s and early 1990s portrayed harassment and discrimination as serious 
problems. Those internal studies produced little action. 
</P>
<P>
 All that has created a culture of acquiescence among many female LAPD 
officers, who say they have silently put up with harassment rather than fight 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned it's better to shut up and not do anything," said one 10-year LAPD 
veteran who said she put up with harassment for years before resigning in 1993 
and ultimately winning a $50,000 settlement from the city. "If you say 
something, you create enemies. . . . There's going to be some type of 
retaliation, whether it's your peers or your supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some female officers say they do not have confidence that the 
LAPD's Internal Affairs Division will fairly handle their complaints. In turn, 
that has undermined confidence in the department's women's coordinator because 
she is married to a captain at Internal Affairs. Department leaders say that 
distrust is unwarranted, but they acknowledge it exists. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that has left many female officers discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it as a normal part of work relations," said one officer who has 
worked for the LAPD for six years and who asked that her name not be used. "I 
think everyone thinks it's really not a problem until something really blatant 
happens to them or someone else they know. Then you start thinking back. When I 
started thinking back about all I had gone through, I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most serious accusations are the cases in which police officers are 
accused of sexually assaulting their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Department sources and others say there have been at least eight such 
allegations leveled against LAPD officers in the last five years. Two of the 
cases were disposed of, one when a lawsuit was settled out of court, the other 
when the accused officer was allowed to resign. But six incidents still are 
being contested, either within the department or in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three cases currently under internal LAPD review, one is based on an 
allegation that a police officer raped a colleague with his gun. The other two, 
sources say, involve police officers who allegedly forced subordinates to have 
sex with them in return for favorable treatment at work. 
</P>
<P>
 While those cases are being reviewed internally, three others are working 
their way through the court system. In separate lawsuits, three officers say 
they were assaulted by male LAPD officers. (The accusers' names are not 
included in this story; it is The Times' policy generally not to identify 
alleged victims of sexual assault.) 
</P>
<P>
 One officer who is suing said she had been partying at the Los Angeles Police 
Academy on Sept. 8, 1990; by her own admission, she drank too much that night. 
As some of her friends were leaving, she ducked into a women's restroom to 
vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her lawsuit, Officer Ernest Hill took advantage of her 
predicament to rape her while she was hunched over the toilet. On Oct. 16, 
three weeks after the incident, she filed a complaint with Internal Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting an investigation, the Internal Affairs officer recommended 
that Hill be sent to a Board of Rights, the LAPD's chief disciplinary body. But 
on Jan. 28, 1991, then-Chief Daryl F. Gates dismissed the charges against Hill 
because he was advised that a board would be unlikely to reach a conclusion 
because there were no other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfied, the female officer continued to press the department to take 
action against Hill. In late 1991, the matter was ordered to a trial board. The 
internal charges against Hill were sustained and he was removed from the 
department. His case, like the four others that have completed the internal 
LAPD disciplinary process, was referred to the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office; no officers were prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's attorney did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A second case cited in a lawsuit also began with a party at the Police Academy 
on May 29, 1991, where the woman met an officer of the LAPD's elite Metro 
Division. According to her lawsuit, the officer offered her a ride home. She 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, she says that the male officer asked to come in, and she let him. 
According to her, he left to move his car a short time later. She believed he 
had gone for the evening, so she went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few minutes later, defendant . . . re-entered (her) home, without her 
knowledge or permission," the suit against him and the LAPD asserts. "After 
returning to (her) home, and despite (her) repeated demands that he stop, 
defendant . . . forcibly sexually assaulted" her. 
</P>
<P>
 The female officer has not worked full time since 1991 and says in her suit 
that she is suffering from a stress-related heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The male officer, in a closed hearing, was found not guilty by a department 
Board of Rights. He remains on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The male officer's lawyer, Robert E. Kelly Jr., said his client is an innocent 
victim who spurned the woman's advances. "Harassment may be a problem (at the 
Police Department)," Kelly said, "but my client is not part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The third pending court case in which sexual abuse is alleged involves a 
rank-and-file officer and one of the department's top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1992, the female officer allegedly asked a high-ranking LAPD 
official for some advice. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason -- attorneys on each side offer conflicting explanations -- 
the two officers agreed to meet at the man's apartment after work. Once there, 
according to the female officer's lawsuit, the man threw her on a bed, pinned 
her down and raped her. She contends that as she lay weeping beneath him, the 
male officer said: "I am an old man, this will not take too long." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his attorney, Barry Levin, the male officer admits having sex 
with the woman but denies that he raped her. An LAPD Board of Rights, in a 
closed hearing, cleared him of wrongdoing last year. Her suit against him and 
the department goes to trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rape cases are by far the most serious allegations of sexual impropriety 
by LAPD officers against their colleagues. But there are scores of other 
complaints scattered throughout the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the harassment seems merely juvenile: In the late 1980s, a computer 
program of two people having sex began making the rounds in the department. 
Male officers would occasionally leave a disk with the program in the terminal 
of a female counterpart, along with a note suggesting that the female officer 
call up "Parkme," the name of the program. When she did, the crude graphic 
would appear on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, the alleged harassment gets more personal, according to a 
variety of pending civil lawsuits: 
</P>
<P>
 Take Cynthia Juarez, who complained in 1987 that she was subjected to "lewd 
remarks and conduct" -- including those from a colleague who allegedly shook 
her shoulders to make her breasts shake. Or Alicia Robalino, a civilian 
employee who said that after she broke off an affair with a co-worker, he 
launched a campaign against her, following her home, breaking into her 
apartment and at one point throwing her from a moving car. Or the woman 
identified in court papers only as "Jane Doe," who filed suit last year against 
the LAPD after a homicide detective named Carlos Brizzolara allegedly made 
sexually explicit remarks to her, asked her out on dates and, on one occasion, 
pushed her head toward his lap as she bent over to retrieve a napkin in a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Another officer who witnessed the restaurant incident told an LAPD Board of 
Rights that the female officer jerked her head up and said, "Cut it out." 
Brizzolara, according to the female officer and the witness, explained his 
actions by saying: "I thought that's what you wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Rights cleared Brizzolara of sexual harassment as a result of 
that incident -- but not because it doubted that the incident actually 
occurred. The Board called Brizzolara's conduct totally inappropriate, while at 
the same time declining to find him guilty because, in its words, there was "no 
evidence of sexual gratification or sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was among those dissatisfied by that board's work, and he ordered a 
second board to review a second set of sexual harassment allegations against 
Brizzolara; that time, Brizzolara, who through his lawyer on Wednesday denied 
any wrongdoing, was found guilty on eight of 11 charges. He is appealing, and a 
judge has ordered the LAPD to grant him yet another Board of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the initial board ruling argued that sexual gratification is not a 
legal element of harassment. If it were, legal experts note, men could 
effectively harass women and then plead innocence by saying they did not enjoy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I tell people about that ruling, they laugh out loud," said Carol Sobel, 
an ACLU lawyer who is handling the female officer's lawsuit along with many 
others brought by alleged harassment victims. "No one can believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment and discrimination in the Police Department were highlighted 
by a series of reports in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, internal LAPD studies found that more than 75% of female police 
officers said they had been the subjects of sexist comments from colleagues on 
the job. Seven out of 10 female officers said they did not believe they were 
judged based on their abilities, and more than half told investigators that 
they had male partners who made unjustifiably negative remarks about their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Those reports were reviewed by the top supervisors of the department. But in 
1991, the Christopher Commission concluded that nothing had been done in 
response to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the commission said the department was riddled with "widespread 
and strongly felt gender bias." Its report cited interviews with training 
officers and excerpts from "blatantly sexist messages" sent over LAPD 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attempt to address the difficulties faced by female police officers 
came last fall, when the Women's Advisory Council to the Police Commission 
completed its study of women in the department and warned that significant 
problems remained. Since then, its authors have hailed a few steps by Chief 
Williams, but they say more aggressive action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This audit is the first thing that they have really done," said Katherine 
Spillar, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and a co-chair of the 
Women's Advisory Council. "But this is a problem that has gone unaddressed for 
years. Sexual harassment has been sanctioned by the leadership of this 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Problems and perceptions of gender bias and sexual harassment in the 
department have altered working relationships, imposing new standards on a 
traditionally male work force as women have broken into new areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some male officers complain that they are being held to politically correct 
standards of behavior even as some female officers worry that their tolerance 
of inappropriate conduct has inadvertently encouraged that conduct to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people who are blatant harassers and have been for years and years," 
said Sgt. Carol Aborn, who has been with the LAPD for more than 10 years and is 
a former president of the Los Angeles Women's Police Officers Assn. "Nothing 
has been done about them for all that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly, Aborn added, that is because many women have been unwilling to make 
complaints, either because they fear retaliation or because they have 
acquiesced to feeling uncomfortable at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught between those choices, some have chosen to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Roberts spent 10 years as an LAPD officer before leaving last summer to 
become a commander in Perris, Calif. Roberts finally left, she said, in part 
because she was tired of the racism and sexism that she encountered within the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Rightly or wrongly, many female officers believe retaliation is common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the women I represent feel like they're victimized twice," said 
Sobel, the ACLU lawyer. "First by the harasser and then by the disciplinary 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 One sergeant, who asked that her name not be used, said working conditions for 
women have improved during her 13 years on the job, but she recounts incidents 
in which her male colleagues made her uncomfortable. Officers screened porno 
movies in the station, posted sexually explicit pictures of women on the walls, 
forced kisses on her and occasionally failed to back her up when she called for 
help. She never filed a complaint about any of those incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to survive out there," said the sergeant, who estimates that 90% of 
LAPD harassment goes unreported. "You need them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the far-flung reaches of the LAPD, there are a few areas that some women 
say they have learned to dread. Chief among them is the West Los Angeles 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, West Los Angeles was home to a pair of informal groups of 
male officers: The first called itself PALS -- short for "Police Against Lousy 
Supervision." It was followed by creation of a second, MAW, an acronym for "Men 
Against Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Some male officers who knew of the groups say they were merely jokes, that no 
genuine hostility was directed either at supervisors or at women. But after 
previous investigations turned up little, the LAPD last year launched what 
department sources say is the most aggressive effort it has ever undertaken to 
root out the problem of sexual harassment in the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting last fall, a lieutenant and three detectives began pulling West Los 
Angeles officers aside and conducting interviews to assess the working 
conditions at the station. What emerged from four months of that process and 
more than 100 interviews, according to department sources, was a 
still-unreleased portrait of a police station beset by harassment: of officers 
who openly disparaged the abilities of their female counterparts, of training 
officers who would go for an entire shift with barely a word spoken to their 
female trainee, of openly racist and sexist remarks and, in at least a few 
instances, of male officers failing to come to the aid of females. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would get in a patrol car and the fellow would lean over and say, 'I don't 
want to hear from you. I don't believe you belong here. Just sit there and be 
quiet,' " said one female LAPD officer who worked at West Los Angeles in the 
mid-1980s. "And that's just what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, two veteran officers, Stephen McNicholas and Jay A. Varga, have been 
transferred out of West Los Angeles. A personnel complaint obtained by The 
Times last month accused the pair of making sexist remarks and of failing to 
come to the aid of female officers on two separate occasions. Department 
sources say Internal Affairs now is investigating whether to bring internal 
charges against those two officers, both of whom vehemently deny any 
wrongdoing. Those same sources say that other officers and their supervisors 
also are under investigation to determine whether they created or tolerated a 
working environment hostile to women. 
</P>
<P>
 At West Los Angeles, some officers accuse LAPD management of orchestrating a 
"witch hunt," against McNicholas and Varga under the guise of a management 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what gets described as sexual harassment is really just sniveling," 
said one male West Los Angeles officer who asked not to be identified. 
"Management is just trying to punish Jay and Steve. The rest of this is just a 
smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Williams declined to discuss the West Los Angeles audit in 
detail, but he acknowledged that sexual harassment and bias are longstanding 
problems within the LAPD, as they are in many law enforcement agencies. 
Williams pledged to attack those issues and create a working environment where 
women need not be afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams added that he intends to create a department ombudsman for 
investigating harassment and bias complaints. He said he will propose creation 
of that unit "very shortly," and promised to invest it with broad investigatory 
powers separate from the Internal Affairs structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum said such steps should demonstrate the LAPD's new resolve to thwart 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has been static along these lines for so long," Greenebaum 
said. "That is not the case anymore. . . . This is a change in the way the 
department is being run, and it's coming from the top." Friction on the Force 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated warnings and lawsuits, documents and interviews show that the 
Los Angeles Police Department continues to grapple with sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender-related harassment complaints in 1993 Assaults: 5 Comments: 25 
Comments, touching: 2 Pictures/videos: 4 Touching: 7 Note: Of the 43 
complaints, 29 were lodged in the first six months of the year. Department 
officials say that is evidence that the LAPD's efforts to root out the problem 
are beginning to yield results. But critics say the drop reflects a lack of 
confidence among women officers that sexual harassment will be properly 
investigated and disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender Equity 
</P>
<P>
 Women's advocates argue that the best way to protect female officers from 
harassment is to build a genuinely diverse work force. They are pushing for 44% 
of the LAPD's annual hires to be women, a figure that mirrors the percentage of 
women in the working population. Although the LAPD is far from achieving that 
goal, it has made significant progress in adding women to the ranks.

DISTRICT'S CALL FOR PARENTAL ADVICE STIRS COUP ATTEMPT; SCHOOLS: DEMAND FOR 
MAJORITY ROLE FOR VOLUNTEERS IS UNLIKELY TO BE ADOPTED. BUT IT COULD ALTER 
OTHER REFORMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Hundreds of volunteers couldn't resist the open invitation from Los Angeles 
Schools Supt. Sid Thompson: Come write a chapter on how to include parents in 
the district's ambitious reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Thompson and district leaders are confronted with an 
unexpected problem of their own making. The volunteers have staged a coup and 
demanded that parents hold the majority vote -- and thus the power -- on new 
councils that would make nearly every important decision at schools, from 
hiring teachers to setting a budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-page report -- born of intense frustration over a school bureaucracy 
that they view as being unresponsive to students' needs -- recommends an 
unprecedented transfer of power held by principals and school district 
officials, and threatens to complicate carefully laid plans already under way 
to reform the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have reached a point of bubbling frustration that we no longer want 
to be advisers -- we want to be decision-makers," said Kathleen Dixon of San 
Pedro, one of three leaders of the parent committee. "This is an incredibly 
powerful message that I hope will be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Group leaders, who represent parents from San Pedro to the San Fernando 
Valley, acknowledge that they do not believe their bold plan will be adopted as 
is. But their pledge to bring parent power to the forefront of district 
policy-making in the coming months has created a potentially volatile 
situation: finding a way to appease vocal parents who are demanding a role in 
the district's unprecedented restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 To move the restructuring along, Thompson asked anyone in the district to help 
devise recommendations for his review. After studying reports from 10 volunteer 
committees, he will bring his final proposal to the school board in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring plan calls for the elimination of regional offices. Instead, 
the district will be broken into clusters -- autonomous groups of high schools 
and their feeder campuses that would share services such as maintenance and 
accounting that are now run from Downtown offices. Clusters would be free to 
design their own instructional programs to allow teachers to do a better job of 
tracking students from elementary to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents group presented their demands in a two-hour meeting Friday with 
Thompson. He made no promises but "was incredibly receptive," giving them 
reason to hope that the initiatives will get a fair hearing among 
policy-makers, parent leaders said. They have begun to lobby Board of Education 
members, whose reactions range from open-mindedness to skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a proposal that the board is going to have to seriously consider," 
school board President Leticia Quezada said. "What will happen in the process, 
I don't know. But this is a voice that has gotten louder and louder." 
</P>
<P>
 It is particularly vexing for the district that the parents' plan to run all 
645 schools through parent-dominated councils conflicts directly with the basic 
premise of the district's highly promoted LEARN plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under LEARN, school principals -- not parent-majority councils -- work in 
collaboration with parents and teachers to decide how to run their campuses. 
The LEARN blueprint, unanimously adopted by the board nearly a year ago, is 
purposefully vague when it comes to school governance so that school 
communities are free to tailor their own plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow we will have to steer between all of this and figure out what we will 
do," Thompson said of the new parent plan. "I'm not saying yes, no, or anything 
in between. I'm saying they have given me a very definite feeling and it's my 
intention to give it full-light-of-day discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent leaders said they carefully considered the LEARN blueprint in their 
discussions and they do not oppose the vaunted plan, which was developed over a 
two-year period with input from more than 600 business leaders, educators, 
parents and community activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we like to say is that LEARN is kind of a skeleton and we are helping to 
flesh it out," Dixon said. Their goal was to find a way to guarantee that 
parents across the city will have a voice in school district affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for parents to have 10 of 19 seats on a panel that also 
includes the principal, one other administrator, three teachers, two students 
and two non-teaching employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The council would have authority over student discipline, curriculum, staff 
training and the use of all school equipment. It would conduct an annual survey 
of parents' needs and develop programs to ensure that those needs are met. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar parent-majority council would be set up at the cluster level. And 
yet another would function at a districtwide level. The Board of Education 
would remain in place as a policy-making body with veto power over parents' 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Mark Slavkin said he is reluctant to embrace their 
recommendations because of the LEARN conflicts. He refuses to endorse any plan 
that would impose a governance structure on all schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "A process built as carefully and thoughtfully as LEARN should not be 
discarded because a self-appointed group comes forward and says 'that wasn't 
our thing and we want to do it differently,' " Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others community leaders and parents involved in LEARN, while saying the 
frustrations are justified, believe the plan would be a step backward for 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent district history suggests that the parents' idea for school governance 
would fall short, like a similar proposal forged during the bitter 1989 
teachers strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's school-based management plan -- which called for teachers to make 
up half of school council membership -- has only taken hold in 92 schools 
because of lingering animosity between teachers and administrators and the lack 
of resources to help schools develop reform plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The importance of LEARN was to get away from this 'who is in control, who 
holds the most votes' way of doing things," said Genethia Hayes, director of 
Project Ahead, an education program run by the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference. "I don't want us in a mold once again as adults fighting for 
territorial rights, when what we should all be doing is working together." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, however, have no misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
 While other restructuring committees -- made up mainly of teachers, 
administrators and district employees -- met during working hours in cafeterias 
and conference rooms throughout the district, parents conducted their Saturday 
morning sessions in the board room. They took their places around the the big 
horseshoe-shaped board table and swiveled in board members' chairs. Spanish, 
Korean and Armenian translators helped the ethnically diverse group follow the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, their final Feb. 19 gathering took on the air of a sports assembly 
with parents applauding and cheering as they read aloud sections of their 
completed document. A section calling for parents participation at district 
labor union bargaining tables drew the loudest cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have been pushed and pushed back, and more and more decisions are 
being made by teachers and administrators," said Nereida Johnson, whose 
children attend Granada Hills High School and Sepulveda Middle School. "Since 
these are our children, we should have a major say in their education." 
</P>
<P>
 Their ultimate weapon, parents said, can be fired in the voting booth, whether 
the occasion is a school board election or a statewide school voucher 
initiative to give them tax money to spend on private education. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are our children and the school district works for us," Dixon said. 
"Board members are elected by us." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also want to have their say at school board meetings and asked for two 
advisory seats on the Board of Education, an idea that was introduced by school 
board member Barbara Boudreaux last month but was tabled when a majority of 
board members said the motion was vague and did little but give parents another 
advisory voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parent leaders said the school board's unwillingness to embrace the 
simplest of initiatives in their plan makes them suspicious of the board's true 
resolve to make parents equal partners in school reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted parent input on a firsthand basis and present it at the same time 
that decisions are being made," said Walter Waddles of South-Central Los 
Angeles, a co-chairman of the committee and father of two elementary school 
boys. "I think they feel threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 The parent issues have raised red flags with leaders of unions for teachers 
and principals who are reluctant to criticize the work of parent volunteers but 
believe the plan has overstepped parental boundaries in education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate their frustration, but the way they are going about this will 
only cause more hostility," by pitting parents as a power group against 
administrators and teachers, United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen 
Bernstein said.

WILSON BOND ISSUE FOR QUAKE AID BLOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first legislative test, Gov. Pete Wilson's $1.05-billion bond issue to 
help pay the state's share of recovery costs from the Northridge earthquake 
went down to surprise defeat before an Assembly committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the Republican governor's election-year reconstruction 
program failed in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee against opposition from 
Democrats who argued against the state incurring more debt. They would rather 
meet the state's obligation through a temporary tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the setback, Wilson's bond proposal, or some version of it, seems to 
be the only politically realistic option available. Most Republicans in both 
houses oppose temporary tax increases and, because it takes a two-thirds vote 
in both houses to raise taxes, majority Democrats cannot act without Republican 
support. The bond bill could be reconsidered as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that this happened, but we are not greatly concerned," said 
J.P. Tremblay, a Wilson spokesman. "We believe this bond issue is the right 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
 The bond legislation, which would be subject to voters' approval June 6, would 
repay costs already incurred for repair of damaged roads and state and local 
public buildings. It also would supplement federal relief by financing 
low-interest loans to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and supporters of the plan had anticipated heated debate at the 
committee hearing, but they also expected the measure to win approval and go to 
the full Assembly for a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback sent Wilson aides and the author, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), scrambling to find favorable votes to overturn the defeat. The bill fell 
four votes short of the 12 needed for approval. Seven Republicans and Democrat 
Barbara Friedman of North Hollywood voted for it while eight Democrats and 
Republican Ross Johnson of Placentia voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican and Democratic sources indicated privately that in the rush to get 
the bill before the committee, the usual lining up of votes and consultations 
apparently did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats generally favor a temporary increase in the sales tax or gasoline 
tax, or a combination of the two, to help finance the state's $1.9-billion 
share of the massive earthquake recovery project. In 1989, a temporary 
quarter-cent sales tax was enacted after the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has ruled out an election-year tax increase as a "last resort," saying 
that the recession-weakened California economy cannot withstand higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other elements of the governor's recovery plan include delaying payment of 
$334 million owed to the federal government for disaster relief and cutting 
$290 million worth of unspecified state services from the budget. Democrats 
want the proposed cuts identified now, which Wilson has refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, President Clinton and 
Congress swiftly committed $9.5 billion in federal relief to Southern 
California, an action that seemed to ease the pressure on Wilson and the 
Legislature to also act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Democrats assailed the Wilson bond issue, charging that it would 
be irresponsible to sell bonds, a form of borrowing, when the state faces a 
multibillion-dollar budget deficit and may incur billions more in prison 
construction costs if "three strikes and you're out" anti-crime bills are 
enacted, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) asked if the governor had a backup 
plan in case voters rejected the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's representative, Steve Olsen of the state Department of Finance, 
said he was not prepared to discuss any contingency plan. He told Burton that 
voters' defeat of the bonds "certainly is a possibility, but I think it is 
unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton shot back, "It's the most gutless thing this tough little Marine 
(Wilson) has ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, whom Wilson had picked to carry the bill, was so confident the 
committee would approve the measure that he did not appear to argue the case. 
Instead, he held a news conference in his San Fernando Valley district, where 
he is the target of a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a telephone interview, Roberti said he had been assured by Wilson 
and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) that the bill faced no 
problem in the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was as surprised as anyone at the committee's vote," Roberti said of 
Brown.

CLOSURE OF OCCUPIED LANDS DEEPENS PALESTINIAN ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All Abdul Nabi Natsheh wanted to do was go to his bank down the road in 
Jerusalem. But the gray-haired Palestinian teacher found his way blocked this 
week by Israeli troops guarding their frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are forbidden," a young soldier told Natsheh, dressed in a tweed coat and 
tie and urgently fingering his yellow worry beads. Natsheh's legal work permit 
for Jerusalem was unfolded but waved away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone from the West Bank is forbidden," the soldier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after Israel eased restrictions on Palestinians crossing from 
Israel's occupied territories into the parts of Israel where tens of thousands 
of Palestinians work, bank, shop and live, the doors are shut again. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown is designed to protect Israel's 5.3 million citizens from 
Palestinians bent on revenge for last week's massacre in a West Bank mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, daily clashes between rock-throwing Palestinians and police have 
resulted in the shooting deaths of a dozen protesters this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Israeli action once again clearly maps the frontiers of what Israel 
considers its sovereign territory. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, it raises questions about the future of that porous, 
embattled border if Mideast peace negotiators decide to make the West Bank part 
of an autonomous Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the 2 million Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip put up 
their own checkpoints to scrutinize the papers of the 130,000 Jewish settlers 
who live there? And what about Jewish visitors? Will they be turned away on the 
whim of Palestinian soldiers, as Israeli soldiers turned away Natsheh? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Jewish settlers themselves have plenty of anxiety about their 
ability under a Palestinian government to survive in their communities, which 
dot the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical is the plea of Rechela Shalit, 45, who lives with her husband in 
Shiloh, a Jewish settlement up the road from here, and who now carries a gun on 
her trips to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let them have the fertile fields. With a good heart, I will give it to them," 
Shalit said. "But just let us live on these hills peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the border post at A-Ram, overlooked by an army tower and operated by 
half a dozen soldiers, the daily experience of Palestinians trying to go to 
work or do errands in Israel is not breeding good feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a permit, but they turn me back. This is the worst injustice," said 
Natsheh, who teaches at a college in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 A mild-mannered 49-year-old, he would seem an unlikely threat to Israeli 
security. His treatment, especially the refusal of the authorities to recognize 
his legal permit to travel to Jerusalem, angers him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see with your own eyes. The Jews get to go through, and us, they turn 
back," he said. "It's racism is all it is." 
</P>
<P>
 All across Israel, scores of the checkpoints are cracking down on Palestinians 
seeking entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars with blue license plates, indicating West Bank registrations, and people 
with identity documents in red plastic folders, identifying Palestinians, spend 
hours in line, while the yellow-plated cars of Israeli residents are waved 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all part of the daily harassment of Palestinians," said a U.N. official 
who was on hand at one checkpoint to help get U.N. workers into Jerusalem. 
Several U.N. buses have been turned away at other checkpoints, despite the 
presence of U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another thing in Arab people's lives to keep them under thumb," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the busiest of those points of entry is A-Ram, on the main road leading 
to Jerusalem from the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Palestinians evade the roadblock entirely, walking quietly through the 
rock-strewn gully less than 100 yards away. If they get caught, and some do, 
they are assessed a 450-shekel fine, or about $150, which they must pay at the 
Jerusalem post office -- if they gain entry to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sihad Kaisba, a 49-year-old father of 12, was trying to get to Jerusalem, 
hoping to obtain some day work and cash his last paycheck, for about $170, so 
he could feed his family. He weighed that need against the risk of a fine and 
decided to try to walk around the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible if I get caught, but what choice do I have?" he asked before 
walking quietly, and successfully, around the border guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, after a series of stabbings and attacks on Israelis by 
Palestinians, the government first sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The grip on the territories was eased, finger by finger, first for doctors, 
teachers and students and, later, for construction workers and others with 
passes from an employer in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the crackdown this week, more than 50,000 Palestinian workers were 
crossing the border each day. That has slowed to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-day strike by West Bank Palestinians was followed by a curfew imposed 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatma Mahmoud Jaba, a 50-year-old from the West Bank who works as a maid in a 
Jewish house in Jerusalem, was turned away at one checkpoint. But she tried her 
luck at A-Ram, where she and other women in the colorful thobe dresses of the 
Palestinians were being allowed through without a check. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not good," Jaba said. "I'm dying inside. Nobody in the world is 
helping us. Why don't the Americans do something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Natsheh, who has seven children at home, said he is too old to try to 
circumvent the roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just keep coming here and try to get across," he said, trudging home 
with his Arabic-language textbooks under one arm. "Tomorrow, the next day and 
the day after, until they let me in." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "one day, if there is peace, I will have my full rights."

SUCCESSES ON BOSNIA BOOST U.S. FOREIGN POLICY TEAM; BALKANS: PRESIDENT CAN 
BOAST OF A NON-ECONOMIC INITIATIVE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. CHRISTOPHER IS SMILING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The praise heaped on the United States by officials from Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as they signed a preliminary peace agreement Tuesday night 
was enough to bring a smile even to the usually dour face of Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year in which the news from Bosnia has come in only two varieties -- 
bad and worse -- Christopher, President Clinton and their deputies suddenly can 
cite a string of successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, for the first time, observers can point to something that can 
legitimately be called a Clinton Administration plan for Bosnia -- Clinton's 
first non-economic initiative in foreign affairs in his 13 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 On most foreign policy issues -- the Middle East, Haiti, Somalia, Korea -- 
Clinton's team has basically continued policies of the George Bush 
Administration or kept a careful distance. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the emerging Clinton approach to Bosnia -- cajoling the Bosnian 
government and Croatia into a working alliance while using North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization force to intimidate Serbian separatists -- marks a sharp 
departure from Bush's policy of not taking sides among the combatants in 
Bosnia's three-sided war. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's initiative, which he launched last month after the deaths of 68 
people in the bombing of an open-air market in Sarajevo, could provide a 
valuable boost in the public perception of Clinton's foreign policy team. But 
it also puts the Administration more directly on the spot in case anything goes 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our judgment, that's worth risking," an Administration official said. "The 
effort in the next few weeks is going to be critical." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's efforts continued to draw praise from both Bosnians and 
Croats on Wednesday. At a news conference, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic complimented U.S. efforts and said American diplomats had pledged to 
"remain committed to this. We welcome that commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 As efforts now turn toward drawing the Serbs -- the third party to the warfare 
-- into an agreement, Silajdzic said he expects Russian pressure will be needed 
to bring the Serbs to the table. He dismissed criticism that the agreement he 
and Croatian representatives signed Tuesday night is merely a piece of paper 
that cannot stop the bloodshed. "All wars ended with a piece of paper and an 
agreement," Silajdzic said. "A piece of paper can be very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added, the de facto alliance between his government and the Croats 
will provide greater leverage if the Serbs do not agree to talk. "What happens 
if they attack (is that) we will have to defend ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia's ambassador to Washington, Peter A. Sarcevic, echoed that sentiment. 
"There is important international pressure" on the Serbs now, he said. As a 
result, "we can see that there are changes in their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying on Capitol Hill, Christopher said he believes the agreement will 
help "create a balance of power more likely, I think, to make the Serbs willing 
to negotiate seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher plans to meet next week with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. 
Kozyrev in Vladivostok for talks that are expected to concentrate on the next 
steps in Bosnia. So far, the Administration and the Russians have loosely 
coordinated their actions, with Washington working on the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government and the Croats while Moscow has cajoled the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the effort to draw the Serbs into an agreement succeeds, the Administration 
will face two new political risks. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Clinton has pledged that once an agreement is reached, the United 
States will provide troops for an international peacekeeping force. Gen. David 
Maddox, commander of U.S. forces in Europe, told reporters here Wednesday that 
he expects such a force to eventually consist of between 20,000 and 30,000 
soldiers. "I ain't goin' in with two squads," he said. "We won't go through 
that operation and not lose an American soldier." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of American troops in the Balkans drew nervous comments from 
several senators Wednesday as Christopher testified on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The second area of risk involves money. Even as they signed the peace 
agreement Tuesday, the Bosnian and Croatian representatives talked of the need 
for reconstruction aid -- a point that Croatian ambassador Sarcevic repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Muslim-Croatian fighting in central Bosnia has been caused by the 
destabilizing impact of tens of thousands of refugees fleeing hostilities 
elsewhere in the region, he said. To prevent the bloodshed from starting anew, 
"a plan of economic recovery for this region" is "very important, crucial," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the unpopularity of all forms of foreign aid, those demands could become 
difficult for the Administration if a peace agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now those risks remain in the distance, and Administration officials 
have been concentrating on how to build on their recent successes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three weeks: 
</P>
<P>
 * A U.S.-instigated NATO ultimatum forced Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw or 
surrender their heavy weapons around Sarajevo, bringing a relative peace to 
that capital city. 
</P>
<P>
 * NATO planes shot down four Bosnian Serb aircraft, breaking the powerful 
inertia that had prevented the alliance from actually using military power in 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 * A U.S.-brokered set of negotiations resulted in the federation agreement 
between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Croat forces. 
</P>

 After months of inconclusive warfare, there now is "a remarkable convergence

COLUMN ONE; 'NEW' KGB: ON TOP OR ON SKIDS?; RUSSIA'S REVAMPED SPY AGENCIES 
SUFFER FROM SLASHED BUDGETS, POOR MORALE AND A DIZZYING IDENTITY CRISIS. BUT 
THE CIA 'MOLE' CASE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT JUST HOW BAD THINGS REALLY ARE.

 As the American intelligence community tallies the damage done by the Aldrich 
Ames espionage affair, it also will try to answer another question: Just how 
good is the new, "reformed" KGB? 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations that the Kremlin had a high-level "mole" inside the CIA -- and 
that Russian counterintelligence has rooted out a Russian defense plant 
executive spying for Britain -- are certain to raise new fears about the reach 
and activities of Russian intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the spy-versus-spy fervor comes at a time when the old KGB has 
been abolished and the two intelligence services that succeeded it appear to be 
in disarray, racked by budget crises, a 30% cut in staff, wrenching 
reorganization, an embittering loss of prestige and a disorienting change in 
mission since the Cold War's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest of CIA official Ames, charged with spying for Moscow in exchange 
for more than $2.5 million, has prompted cynical spy-watchers to ask: How did 
the Russians afford it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise to discover that they still had enough money to buy Jaguars 
for their agents," said Christopher Andrew, a historian specializing in 
espionage at Cambridge University. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames allegedly was recruited in 1985, when the Soviet Union was richer and 
intensely anxious about the Ronald Reagan Administration's military buildup. It 
was not until 1991 that Ames' profligate spending, including a $25,000 down 
payment on a Jaguar sedan, reportedly drew American authorities' attention to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged U.S. officials believe that Ames may have given Russian intelligence 
lethal information about the identities of American agents and operating 
procedures. But if Ames is a turncoat, he may be among the last of a breed that 
will be difficult to replace. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian sources today paint a portrait of a tamer, poorer and far more 
disorganized intelligence network that poses a greatly reduced threat to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financial difficulties, political confusion, the complete lack of guidance 
from the political leadership as to what are the most crucial areas -- all of 
this has been extremely detrimental to the intelligence community," said Alexei 
G. Arbatov, a national security analyst at the Institute of World Economy and 
International Relations in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian intelligence today "might continue some operations, but clearly they 
would be on a much, much smaller scale than previously," Arbatov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the old KGB was financed on such a shoestring that its overseas 
"residents," or spy station chiefs, were reportedly permitted to spend no more 
than $300 without approval from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the money crunch is so severe that employees of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service, the KGB successor agency that would have supervised Ames, do not have 
access to personal computers and must share typewriters, according to the New 
Daily, a feisty new Moscow newspaper. In an expose last week, it documented the 
disarray in Russian intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 A paper shortage has forced agents to type reports on the backs of old 
documents. Their offices can no longer afford subscriptions even to Russian 
newspapers and magazines, let alone foreign periodicals, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the other half of the 
former KGB, confirmed in an interview that his agency also has not been 
allocated money for subscriptions this year. Even so, he said, money would be 
found to reward an especially well-placed source. "In case we need additional 
money to pay valuable agents, we may apply directly to the president," said the 
spokesman, Sergei P. Bogdanov. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union always had great difficulty recruiting American agents. KGB 
documents smuggled out of the Soviet Union by defector Oleg Gordievsky show 
that KGB bosses repeatedly reprimanded subordinates for an "unacceptably low 
standard" of recruitment, Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordievsky escaped from Russia in 1985. The last complaint he smuggled out is 
dated February of that year. Ames is alleged to have been recruited in May, 
1985. But Andrew said Western scholars have no documents after that date to 
indicate whether the KGB was satisfied with the information it was allegedly 
getting from Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 After working undetected as a double agent for the British for 11 years, 
Gordievsky was fingered at precisely the time when Ames was allegedly 
recruited. "I have no proof that Ames was responsible, but the fit is a 
striking one," Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Soviets had problems snagging Americans, Russia is finding the task 
even tougher, said the New Daily article, which was based on interviews with 10 
unnamed agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because money was short and agents motivated by lucre tend to be unreliable, 
most Soviet foreign agents came in two types: idealists who wished to help the 
socialist workers' state; and anti-American activists, usually in the Third 
World, who sought to counter U.S. "hegemonic" intent toward their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents who wanted to build communism have lost interest now that Russia has 
embraced capitalism and is defending its own national interests, not the 
workers of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one of these people -- and some of them had cooperated with us for 20 
years -- would work for the idea of a Great Russia,' " the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor V. Ivanenko, former head of the Security Ministry, said in an interview 
Monday, "Of course, it is getting increasingly costly to recruit agents now 
that the intelligence service has to rely mostly on material incentives, with 
the old ideological dogmas forgotten and forsaken. But we still can play on 
universal human values -- on the natural resistance to American egotism." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jeffrey Richelson, a Washington-based expert on intelligence, said 
that in recent years none of the Americans spying for Moscow has been 
ideologically motivated. They either wanted money or to settle a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the Soviets got priceless secrets for a pittance. In 1978, the 
KGB paid former CIA employee William Kampites just $3,000 for the manual to a 
KH-11 "keyhole" satellite, for which the Soviets would likely have shelled out 
vastly more, Richelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanenko said agents are finding sources of financing that would have been 
heresy in Soviet times. In some places, operatives are allowed to open 
businesses -- to provide a better cover and to raise money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not only foreigners that are proving difficult to recruit. Most 
bright, multilingual Russian graduates from elite universities would rather 
land a job at IBM than in the supposedly reformed KGB. The number of students 
at the Andropov Red Banner Institute, which trains intelligence staff, has 
dropped from 300 to about 50; the students are no longer Russia's best and 
brightest, the New Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
 After purges, attrition and two chaotic reorganizations, the Foreign 
Intelligence Service (known to the CIA as the SVRR), and the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service (SVR), have about one-third fewer employees than 
the old KGB, Russian officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The counterintelligence agency says it has slashed its work force from 137,000 
to a still-enormous 75,000. There are no comparable estimates for the Foreign 
Intelligence Agency, which handles intelligence gathering outside of Russia, 
including in the former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative analyst J. Michael Waller, director of the International Freedom 
Foundation in Washington, argues that the KGB may have become leaner but 
remains just as mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole KGB, like the entire Soviet bureaucracy, was bloated with a lot of 
do-nothing personnel," Waller said. He added that the Foreign Intelligence 
Service remains "world class." Moreover, he argues, despite all the talk about 
the "reformed" KGB, Russia's civilian government does not fully control the 
intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
 Many former KGB leaders were purged after the August, 1991, attempt to 
overthrow Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But KGB veterans continued to 
dominate when the agency was turned into the Russian Security Ministry later 
that year. In December, President Boris N. Yeltsin abolished the Security 
Ministry and split its functions between the two new agencies, the SVR and the 
SVRR. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system of the organs of the VChK-OGPU-NKVD-MGB-KGB-MB turned out to be 
unreformable," Yeltsin said in a harshly worded decree that spelled out all the 
acronyms by which the secret police have been known since Bolshevik days. 
</P>
<P>
 All employees were ordered to undergo a recertification process that was 
widely interpreted as a license to purge. On Wednesday, the just-fired head of 
the counterintelligence agency, Nikolai M. Golushko, said that of the 250 
senior officers who have undergone recertification procedures since December, 
14 had failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people fled the old KGB as soon as they could do so without political 
repercussions. Insiders complain that many of the very best -- skilled 
intelligence analysts, linguists, computer and communications experts -- have 
found more lucrative jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides losing massive numbers of personnel, Russia has closed 30 overseas 
listening posts. Its once-massive agent network in Eastern Europe has been 
gutted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say all of these factors have affected the quality of the daily 
intelligence briefing that appears on Yeltsin's desk each morning. "Only the 
Lord knows what garbage we are sending them," one SVRR source told New Daily. 
"But they swallow it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Waller is skeptical. Russia hasn't said which overseas spy stations it closed, 
and it could have abandoned that many in strategically unimportant Third World 
countries where the KGB's main job was to promote local Communist parties, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials insist the infamous old KGB is no more. Russian intelligence 
is now forbidden to use "substances damaging to human health" -- presumably the 
poisoned umbrellas and truth serums of old -- as well as to blackmail people 
into cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides catching foreign spies, the counterintelligence agency handles 
counterterrorism, drug trafficking, illegal arms sales, smuggling of 
radioactive materials and even prevention of industrial accidents, Bogdanov 
said. A report of shoddy maintenance on an aircraft led to an engine being 
replaced, preventing a near-certain crash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like nearly every other Russian intelligence official interviewed in recent 
months, Bogdanov complained of a marked escalation of Western intelligence 
gathering inside Russia and in the other former republics since the breakup of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Broke or not, as long as Russian intelligence believes the West is trying to 
take advantage of its new vulnerability, the spy game will go on.

U.S. ADMITS AGENTS SHOT INNOCENT MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal authorities made a rare public apology Wednesday to an innocent man 
who was shot and seriously wounded when heavily armed agents stormed his house 
in a midnight drug raid 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Alan D. Bersin said the government admits liability and intends to 
pay monetary damages to Donald Carlson, who has filed a $20-million lawsuit 
against agents of the U.S. Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration 
and other federal and local forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were deceived by our informant and must accept responsibility for that 
fact," Bersin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, a 41-year-old computer company executive with no criminal record, 
awoke around midnight Aug. 26, 1992, to the sound of violent pounding on his 
front door, according to his suit. After trying to telephone police and yelling 
without response for the intruders to identify themselves, he grabbed a pistol 
and fired two shots. The agents knocked down the door with a battering ram, 
hurled an explosive device and shot him three times -- twice after he had 
dropped the gun and lay helpless on his bedroom floor, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson suffered serious wounds, including lasting damage to his respiratory 
system, arm and shoulder, his lawyer said. An agent received a superficial leg 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
 No drugs were found. Carlson was the victim of a bogus tip from an informant, 
who told wild tales about heavily armed South American drug traffickers using 
Carlson's home in suburban Poway as a cocaine warehouse, authorities say. The 
informant was charged in January with lying to agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy for everyone involved is that although everyone acted in good 
faith, Mr. Carlson was still severely injured," Bersin said. "Law enforcement 
investigations are designed to be conducted in as fail-safe a manner as 
possible. However, in the case of the Carlson shooting, the system did fail." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a judge's order, authorities did not disclose the results of three 
internal investigations into the case involving Operation Alliance, a 
multi-agency narcotics unit based at the U.S.-Mexico border. The incident 
forced federal drug fighters here to toughen rules on using confidential 
informants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Customs agents named in the lawsuit have not been disciplined, said John 
Kelley, special agent in charge of the agency's San Diego office. He declined 
to comment on the internal investigation. Officials said they hope to discuss a 
settlement with Carlson, but did not specify an amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The response from Carlson's attorney was brief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say we agree with one thing: The government is liable," said R. J. 
Coughlan Jr. "Beyond that, whether we agree or disagree will be based on 
conversations with Mr. Carlson and full evaluation of what they are saying." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit paints a nightmarish picture, accusing three Customs agents, a 
federal prosecutor and other officials of acting on uncorroborated information, 
ignoring warnings about the informant's credibility and conspiring to cover up 
misconduct. The defendants allegedly "misused the search warrant process . . . 
to bolster their own reputations and careers" and "advance the war on drugs," 
according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials say they determined that the informant, Ronnie Edmonds, had 
falsely implicated several other people, including a San Diego County law 
enforcement officer, in a cocaine ring that did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant, however, asserted that he never gave agents Carlson's address 
and asked them to delay the raid so he could verify the location, according to 
the suit. He is imprisoned while awaiting trial on 25 counts of giving false 
statements to government agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid's catastrophic outcome prompted San Diego anti-drug agencies to 
re-examine their rules on the use of confidential informants, who are often 
convicted criminals operating in a murky nether world between investigators and 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a practical matter these situations are being looked at in a different 
light," said a federal prosecutor who asked not to be identified. "I think 
there already has been a tightening up of rules for handling informants." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the DEA has held mandatory special training sessions for all 
agents regarding informants, according to spokesman Jack Hook. Other agencies 
are also reviewing procedures, according to Bersin, who became U.S. attorney 
late last year. He said the decision to admit liability was "the right and fair 
step to take given the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the government has accepted liability in such a case in 
the San Diego area and one of only a few similar cases nationwide, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't typically admit liability when people are shot and the damage is in 
very large amounts," an official said. "It is extremely rare."

CLINTON URGES ARAFAT TO RENEW PEACE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton appealed personally to Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat and angry Palestinians on Wednesday to resume peace 
talks with Israel, warning that a breakdown in negotiations would "hand a 
victory" to the Jewish extremist who massacred 48 worshipers in a West Bank 
mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the peace talks don't get back on track, then we are rewarding the damage 
and the death wreaked by the extremists," Clinton told reporters at the White 
House. "We don't want to do that. We want to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made an impassioned appeal 
of his own to Palestinian leaders to resume the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe at this stage, the leadership of both sides, Palestinians and us, 
have to stand up to overcome pain, sorrow and agony and to understand that the 
real solution is in the political field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using similar arguments, Clinton and Rabin called for logic to prevail over 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both insisted that the only chance the Palestinians have to improve their 
living conditions in the Israeli-occupied territories is to resume negotiations 
over limited self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 But they both ruled out measures that Arafat has demanded as a condition for 
resuming the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 He has said that all Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip should be 
disarmed and that the settlements should be moved away from Arab population 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged that the mood among Palestinians after the Hebron 
massacre is so angry that logic apparently has little appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians in the occupied territories and in refugee camps in Jordan 
and Lebanon are condemning Arafat for trying to make peace with Israel at all, 
arguing that the peace process somehow made it easier for an American-born 
Israeli settler to shoot up the Ibrahim Mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know (Arafat's) under a lot of pressure at home, and I understand that," 
Clinton said. "The only thing that I would say to the Palestinians who are 
pressuring Arafat not to resume talks is that that is the surest way to hand a 
victory to the madman who killed all the Palestinians in the mosque." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking up the same theme, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the 
Palestinians must get beyond their demand for revenge and realize that only 
peace will give them "a different future." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that any hiatus (in the talks) . . . is to the benefit of the 
extremists," Christopher said. "They are able to exploit delay, pointing out to 
the people on the ground that the present circumstances are not causing any 
progress and thus urging people there to turn to more extreme measures." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to meet Friday with Nabil Shaath, a top adviser to Arafat, on 
ways to restart the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But PLO sources said that Shaath's only objective is to persuade Washington to 
apply more pressure on Israel, a step the Administration has already ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to foreign correspondents in Jerusalem, Rabin said that Israeli and 
PLO negotiators were tantalizingly close to agreement on the details for 
Palestinian self-government before the Hebron massacre intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to the atrocity in Hebron, we were closer than ever to an agreement on 
security measures, to maps on how Gaza and Jericho should be delineated and how 
to transfer power from Israel's military government to the (Palestinian) civil 
authority," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Rabin's rejection of Palestinian demands to dismantle settlements and 
disarm settlers, Israeli police imposed restrictions on 18 Jewish activists in 
the ultranationalist Kach and Kahane Hai movements. The militants were ordered 
to turn in their army-issued weapons and were placed under travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has also made other conciliatory gestures, including the release this 
week of 570 Palestinian prisoners. Another 400 are to be freed today and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel "is not blind" to Arafat's need for 
concrete concessions before he can return to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 A top Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, arrived in Jerusalem from PLO 
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, with a letter from Arafat to Rabin, outlining 
PLO proposals for resuming the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinians want to see certain changes on the ground," Erekat said, 
"and Israel's response to our position will be a test of its sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, often-violent protests over the massacre continued across the 
occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two Palestinians were killed, and hospitals reported nearly 100 wounded in 
the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 17-year-old was shot dead in Hebron, according to military sources, when 
hundreds of youths poured into the streets, throwing stones and firebombs 
during a three-hour lifting of the curfew that has kept the town's population 
of 65,000 largely confined to its houses for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Jericho, a rally turned violent with hundreds of demonstrators stoning 
police and soldiers, who opened fire, killing a 20-year-old Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said he intends to maintain the widespread curfews in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip and to bar most residents of both regions from Israel until the 
violence subsides, although this means that more than 50,000 Palestinians are 
unable to get to their jobs in Israel.

SCIENTISTS SEARCHING FOR 'MISSING' QUAKES; GEOLOGY: DATA SHOWS TOO FEW TEMBLORS 
TO ACCOUNT FOR FAULT SHIFTS, RESEARCHERS TELL HOUSE PANEL. SOME SAY THIS COULD 
MEAN A SERIES OF NORTHRIDGE-LEVEL JOLTS IN COMING DECADES, OR A SINGLE MUCH 
BIGGER ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scientists examining movement along faults in Southern California said 
Wednesday that the region may be in for a series of earthquakes comparable to 
the Northridge temblor -- or a single far greater quake -- in upcoming decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucile M. Jones, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, 
told a House committee that the Southern California Earthquake Center has 
looked at 150 years of quake data and concluded that there have not been enough 
quakes to explain all the shifting along faults. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying at a hearing of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, Jones 
said the region has experienced "only one-third the number of large and major 
earthquakes" expected, given the rate of movement along faults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the missing earthquakes?" Jones said. Her answer was that stresses 
accumulated inside the earth may be unleashed in the coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the executive director of the Southern California Earthquake 
Center said he was "a little bit aghast" that the conclusions were announced 
Wednesday, but he added that the findings are endorsed by scientists in the 
group. There is some disagreement, however, about the probability of quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've reached a point now where our models are predicting more 
Northridge-type earthquakes or bigger earthquakes in the future than we've had 
in the last 150 years," said Tom Henyey, the center's executive director. The 
Southern California Earthquake Center was established by the National Science 
Foundation to improve the methodology for forecasting quake movement in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighting the lack of certainty in earthquake analysis, Henyey added that 
it is also possible that seismic stress has not increased. Scientists are still 
evaluating data for a detailed report to be released this summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the center's overall finding is consistent with concerns 
expressed by other scientists that the Jan. 17 Northridge quake may have been a 
forerunner, if not a foreshock, to a more intense temblor or a series of 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Lindh, chief of seismology for the Geological Survey at Menlo Park, said 
Wednesday there were one or two serious earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay 
Area each decade for 70 years before the catastrophic quake in 1906. He said 
that such a pattern -- which has also been recorded in Japan and Russia -- 
appears to be repeating itself in Southern California in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this evidence that the stress level in the ground in Southern California 
is building back to the point where there will be another great earthquake?" 
Lindh said in an interview. "The answer is probably yes. Then the question is: 
How soon? We probably don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who is also a visiting research associate at Caltech, offered three 
possible explanations for what she called "the L.A. dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
 The first is that the region is in for "at least five more earthquakes as 
large as the Northridge earthquake," a magnitude 6.8, she said. Under this 
scenario, the high rate of damaging quakes in the Los Angeles area in the last 
six years may be the long-term norm. 
</P>
<P>
 The second option, Jones said, is that "we are building up the stress to a 
much larger earthquake" of magnitude 7.5 to 8. She said that "only one 
magnitude 8 would be needed to release the energy of 30 magnitude 7 events." 
</P>
<P>
 The third possibility is that movement on the faults is occurring without 
precipitating earthquakes. Jones said such slippage might explain some of the 
"missing" quakes but not all. Slippage of faults without corresponding quakes 
has been "shown to be an important part of the picture elsewhere in the world 
but not so far in Southern California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining which of the explanations, or combination of them, is right would 
require "analysis of five to 10 years of data from improved geodetic and 
seismic networks," Jones said. She said that funding is inadequate for research 
on earthquake prediction and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Henyey said that the earthquake center's study was based on historic seismic 
activity, examination of the sidewalls of major faults dating back as far as 
3,000 years and a relatively new process of using satellites to measure 
movements of Earth's crust as small as a millimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the center has devised an analytic model that indicates "the 
earth is apparently straining at a much more rapid rate than would be suggested 
by past earthquake history."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THIS PARTY IS BRING YOUR OWN BUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Michael Huffington is like the party crasher whose gall in showing up 
uninvited is quickly forgiven when he brings his own vintage wine, hors 
d'oeuvres, gifts for the host and a beautiful date. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) is the enormously wealthy -- "I have no financial 
needs that cannot be met" -- son of a Texas oilman who moved to California in 
1991 and, in effect, bought himself a congressional seat. The political novice 
spent $5.4 million of his own money on a 1992 race that trampled fellow 
Republican Robert J. Lagomarsino, a respected native and nine-term congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he believed in term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, only a few months into his own first term, the Texas transplant 
announced he wasn't satisfied being a mere House member and wanted to run for 
one of California's U.S. Senate seats. And anybody who has been watching 
television -- especially the Winter Olympics -- has seen him again dipping into 
his own vast fortune, buying millions of dollars in political advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 He is considered by most political pros to be a shoo-in for the Republican 
nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in November. And if he 
should upset Feinstein -- which until recently seemed inconceivable but now is 
looking like a long-shot possibility -- what next? 
</P>
<P>
 Would the ambitious junior senator from the nation's biggest state lock his 
sights on the Republican vice presidential nomination in 1996, seeing it as a 
steppingstone to the Oval Office? Would a newly arrived Texan have the chutzpah 
to promptly run for the House, then instantly for the Senate? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Huffington at the Republican state convention last weekend whether he 
was pledging to serve a full six-year term if elected to the Senate, thereby 
resisting any temptation to immediately flirt with presidential politics. It 
was a question most politicians answer with weasel words, trying to avoid a 
potential trap by saying something like, "It is my full intention to serve . . 
. . " Their intentions later can change. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year Huffington was more candid, if less politic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way," he responded unhesitantly. "I wouldn't exclude any 
options. I would not exclude any options at all. If the people want me to do 
something else, fine. But I'm running for the Senate with no intent to do 
anything else after that -- just as when I ran for the House, I had no 
intention of running for the Senate at this stage. But am I glad I'm running 
for the Senate? You better believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are words that normally would sound an alert among potential party 
rivals, such as Gov. Pete Wilson. The governor's own presidential prospects 
will be revived if he defies the odds and wins reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson, who has more immediate political concerns, quietly is cheering on 
Huffington for the same reason most other Republican candidates are: the 
neophyte's apparent willingness to spend many millions of his own money and 
stay out of some contribution troughs where they are feeding. His personal 
wealth is "in the ballpark" of $50 million to $70 million, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, God bless him. He's putting in his own money," observes state Senate 
Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is an expectation that Huffington -- although he hasn't yet 
committed to it -- will give the California GOP a million or so to help finance 
voter registration and turnout. This will benefit all Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 And just making Feinstein run hard will force her to solicit and spend 
contributors' money that otherwise would benefit other Democratic candidates, 
such as the party's gubernatorial nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also should have mainstream voter appeal in a general election: 
He's a fiscal conservative who opposes tax increases but a social moderate who 
supports basic abortion rights and gay rights and voted for the Family Leave 
Act. He is a co-chairman of the "three strikes" initiative -- which he is 
helping to finance -- and favors modest gun controls. 
</P>
<P>
 He is intelligent, articulate, energetic, likable, TV handsome -- and inspired 
by a beautiful, brilliant wife: Greek-born Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington, a 
noted author and TV talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
 One crucial but not insurmountable task for Huffington will be to persuade 
voters that it's not unfair or undemocratic to be super-rich and finance most 
of his own campaign. "I'd rather be beholden to the voters and not the special 
interests," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also must convince Californians he knows enough about his new state to 
understand its problems. "God gave me a brain. I can hear what the problems 
are," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington crashed the party uninvited, but he could become the hit -- as long 
as he pays his own tab.

STUDY FINDS BIG GAP IN WORKERS' HEALTH COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half of the people covered by Medi-Cal are employed full or part time 
but do not receive health insurance from their employers, according to a new 
UCLA study. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing health care to these uninsured workers costs taxpayers at least $4 
billion per year, E. Richard Brown told the state's Task Force on Health Care 
Reform in Sacramento on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of uninsured in the state has also been growing, reaching 6.3 
million people in 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, 
he said. One of every six uninsured people in the United States lives in 
California, and the number of uninsured residents is growing more than twice as 
fast as the number with insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to the problem is straightforward, Brown told the task force 
headed by state Sen. Diane Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, we need to require employers to provide a contribution to 
health coverage," he said. "And we need to provide subsidies to both employers 
and low-income families to help pay for the cost of coverage. We do provide 
subsidies now, but they are not being distributed fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of every 10 uninsured Californians work for -- or are dependents of an 
employee of -- firms with fewer than 25 employees, according to the study 
published by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. Most such firms have 
historically been unable to provide health care coverage for employees because 
of low profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
 But one-fourth of the uninsured work for -- or are dependents of an employee 
of -- companies with more than 100 employees, which traditionally provide such 
coverage. "Many large and small firms increasingly hire contingent temporary 
and part-time workers, usually without benefits, only for peak work periods," 
said Roberta Wyn, a co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "When an employer decides that he can't, or doesn't have to, provide coverage 
. . . then the costs of care are borne by other people -- taxpayers," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking only at the non-elderly population because virtually all the elderly 
are covered by Medicare or other insurance, the study found that the number of 
uninsured in California rose by 422,000 between 1989 and 1992, a 6.6% increase. 
In contrast, the number of people with private insurance rose by only 164,000 
during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall percentage of uninsured remained stable at 23% because Medi-Cal 
coverage of the non-elderly increased from 10% of the state population in 1989 
to 12% in 1992.

WILSON CALLS FOR UNIFIED CRIME BILL; POLITICS: GOVERNOR CHARGES THAT THE SENATE 
IS TRYING TO EMBARRASS HIM BY ADVOCATING FIVE CONFLICTING MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson urged legislators Wednesday to iron out the conflicts among 
five crime bills before sending the legislation to his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, complaining that the state Senate is playing politics in an effort to 
embarrass him, said he wants legislation that mirrors the "three strikes and 
you're out" initiative that is on its way to the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Republican governor said, the Legislature should send him 
other bills with provisions that are even tougher than the proposed ballot 
measure, including a law that would send two-time rapists, child molesters and 
arsonists to prison for life without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said he wants these proposals sent to him in a way that blends the 
most stringent parts of all the bills. He criticized a recent Senate maneuver 
that would prevent him from doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the opportunity to give the public all the protection it needs," 
Wilson told reporters in his office. "We shouldn't play political games." 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting with five state assemblymen who are carrying the legislation, 
Wilson seemed to be making some headway in advance of a showdown scheduled for 
the Senate floor this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those conferring with the governor was Republican Assemblyman Richard 
Rainey of Walnut Creek, a former county sheriff who is pushing a competing bill 
that is narrower than the "three strikes" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ballot initiative and a bill that parallels it would require a 
life term for anyone convicted of a felony after committing two serious or 
violent felonies and one other felony of any kind. Conceivably, a two-time 
loser who wrote a bad check could face life in prison under the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Rainey's bill would trigger a life sentence only if the third 
crime were also a serious or violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, circulated by a Fresno man whose daughter was killed by a 
repeat felon, apparently has enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The 
sponsor, Mike Reynolds, said Wednesday that he was submitting signatures in 40 
counties and planned to wait until Monday, his deadline, to file the final 
petitions while watching progress of the bills moving through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's competing measure has the backing of many prosecutors and judges who 
fear that the Reynolds initiative would overwhelm the criminal justice system 
and needlessly crowd the prisons with nonviolent, elderly inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative leaders have made it clear in recent days that their members are 
loathe to vote against the original "three strikes" bill or any of the similar 
measures that carry the same name. That is why five bills that include some 
competing provisions are on the fast track toward the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said earlier that he was prepared to sign all of the bills and let the 
courts sort out the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Senate committee on Monday added amendments to four of the bills that 
would automatically repeal all but the last one Wilson signs. And that bill 
would be repealed if the voters passed the "three strikes" initiative in the 
fall.

GRAY DAVIS TO RUN FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Controller Gray Davis announced his candidacy Wednesday for lieutenant 
governor, saying he seeks to become "an ambassador of hope" to help turn around 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the stance of a Sacramento outsider, the veteran Democratic 
politician assailed leaders of both major parties for failing to solve the 
state's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of the last decade, other states were preparing themselves for the 
economic competition of the 90s," Davis said. "But California's leaders -- 
Republican and Democratic -- sat back, cocky and complacent, in the false 
conviction that our undeniable natural advantages . . . would simply sell 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 51, said he would turn the lieutenant governor's office -- historically 
a political dead-end -- into a platform for ensuring that home-grown inventions 
lead to jobs in California, not in other states or nations. 
</P>
<P>
 With his wife, Sharon, at his side, Davis made his announcement to about 50 
supporters, including half a dozen lawmakers, and in front of a banner that 
read, "Gray Davis, Bring California Back." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is unopposed by any major candidate in the Democratic primary in June. 
With nearly $2 million in his campaign treasury, he appears to be the early 
favorite against two lesser known Republican candidates for the post being 
vacated by Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who is retiring from politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying for the GOP nomination are Assemblyman Stan Statham of Oak Run, who has 
proposed dividing California into three states, and Sen. Cathie Wright, a 
veteran Simi Valley lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis seemed to be sharpening his lines for the fall campaign, aiming his 
barbs at Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and his GOP predecessor, George 
Deukmejian. He said the state's sagging economy was made worse by 11 years of 
Republican governors "who believed that state government had no role to play in 
preparing for California's economic future." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he wasn't running for the state's top spot, Davis paused and said 
there were already three well qualified Democrats in the governor's contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who served as chief of staff to the state's last Democratic chief 
executive, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., was twice elected to the state Assembly 
from Los Angeles before winning the controller's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, he lost a Democratic primary race for U.S. Senate to Dianne 
Feinstein.

 A Continental Airlines plane nearly plunged into a bay when it aborted a 
takeoff from La Guardia Airport during a snowstorm and skidded into a 
dike.Twenty-nine of the 110 passengers aboard Denver-bound Flight 795 suffered 
injuries, said Robert Leonard, an Emergency Medical Services spokesman. The 
twin-engine MD80 jet was taking off about 6 p.m. EST when it tried to abort the 
flight, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Moderate snow and 26 m.p.h. 
winds were reported but officials said it was too early to tell if the weather 
was a factor.

 Armenia's only rail supply link was cut early Wednesday when an explosion 
seriously damaged a bridge in a region of Georgia populated mainly by ethnic 
Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb went off along a 70-yard-long bridge in Georgia's Marneulsky region, 
the country's Interior Ministry reported. The region lies in the Caucasus 
Mountains near the Armenian border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are totally cut off from the rest of the world," Armenian government 
spokesman Vladimir Manoian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have been fighting for six years for control 
of the largely Armenian-populated Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.

KURDISH LAWMAKERS ARRESTED IN TURKEY; RIGHTS: TWO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO BE 
CHARGED WITH TREASON AFTER IMMUNITY IS LIFTED. MOVE ADDS TO GROWING SENSE OF 
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Police arrested two leading Kurdish members of Parliament on Wednesday, in a 
move that added to Turkey's growing atmosphere of political and economic 
crisis, escalating nationalist sentiment and diminishing respect for human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Security forces took Hatip Dicle and Orhan Dogan into custody after right-wing 
parties in Parliament voted to lift the immunity from prosecution of several 
lawmakers who belong to Turkey's only legal Kurdish nationalist group, the 
Democracy Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever they do to us, we will go on saying what we believe," Dogan said in 
a corridor of Parliament before police drove him away. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men will be charged with treason and may face the death sentence, 
Turkish state television said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kurdish members of Parliament facing prosecution and arrest may increase 
to seven. They will probably be joined by Hasan Mezarci, a maverick Islamic 
fundamentalist member of Parliament who is accused of a crime against the state 
for insulting Kemal Ataturk, the long dead founder of the secular republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiery Dicle infuriated many Turks, particularly in the armed forces, when 
he said a bombing by the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) last month that 
killed five Turkish army cadets was a justifiable act of war. He is accused of 
harboring PKK guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 The other five Kurds have gotten in trouble only on the basis of speeches they 
made, usually demanding more rights for Turkey's ethnic Kurds, 20% of Turkey's 
60 million people. "We are only being prosecuted for crimes of thought," said 
Ahmet Turk, a Parliament member, who, despite his name, is a leading Kurdish 
nationalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Turk and Leyla Zana, another member of Parliament, have taken the Turkish 
Kurdish case to Washington and were recently part of a Kurdish delegation 
received by French President Francois Mitterrand. But the Turkish government 
seems ready to brave all Western criticism due to a sense of crisis advancing 
from all fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats worry that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller may be ready to fan 
the flames of Turkish nationalism in a risky bid to buttress her sagging 
support and deflect worries about the economy. The Turkish lira and financial 
system are under intense strain after years of poorly managed economic growth 
fueled by foreign borrowing stumbled in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciller organized a rally on Monday to "Respect Ataturk," but only about 10,000 
people turned up, some of them true believers but many of them schoolchildren 
and state workers bused in to Istanbul's Taksim Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Even such public displays, however, may not be enough to preserve Ciller's 
regime. Although few diplomats believe a new spate of rumors of an impending 
coup, nobody rules out military intervention in the politics of a country that 
has suffered three coups since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of military unease has been encouraged by the worsening Kurdish 
insurgency in southeastern Turkey. Almost 11,000 people have been killed there 
since 1984, and it is now one of the worst areas of open conflict in the Middle 
East. The secularist officer corps also fears an explosion in votes for Islamic 
parties in nationwide municipal elections on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kurds have their complaints too, noting that 70 or so activists of the 
Democracy Party have been killed; they contend the assassins have been 
protected by the state. "I've been in Salvador, and there is no doubt in my 
mind that these are death squads," one Western diplomat said.

JAPAN'S HOSOKAWA GIVES UP PLANS TO FORM NEW CABINET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two weeks of futile efforts to win approval from his coalition partners, 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced late Wednesday that he is abandoning 
plans to form a new Cabinet to carry out economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In his third late-night news conference in three months, Hosokawa said he will 
retain his existing Cabinet, at least until Japan's fiscal 1994 budget is 
enacted, to maintain unity of the seven lower house and eight upper house 
parties supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
 The new blow to his leadership nonetheless displayed what appears to be an 
irreparable split between the right and left wings of his coalition, which 
embraces a political spectrum ranging from Liberal Democratic Party defectors 
to Marxist-imbued Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 It also forces him to retain as a chief aide and coordinator of the Cabinet a 
leader who has openly questioned his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap created a two-week hiatus in Japan's efforts to resolve trade 
frictions with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to reach agreement on a framework for economic relations in a 
meeting with President Clinton on Feb. 11, Hosokawa promised to act "urgently" 
to come up with a new Japanese proposal. But now a deadline has been set for 
the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised news conference that began after 11 p.m., Hosokawa 
said he had wanted to form a new Cabinet to focus on economic reforms and 
U.S.-Japan economic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission of enacting political reforms, the Cabinet's initial goal when 
Hosokawa took over last August, has largely been accomplished, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But he could not win approval from the left-leaning wing of his coalition, 
Hosokawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Constitutionally, the prime minister is empowered to act alone in appointing 
and dismissing cabinets or ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition is built upon a delicate balance. A zigzag course is 
unavoidable," Hosokawa admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in two months that the prime minister was forced to bow 
to his coalition's left wing. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Socialist rebels defeated Hosokawa's political reform bills in the 
upper house, forcing him to accept a compromise with the opposition Liberal 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 And in February, when Hosokawa announced his intention to raise a 
controversial consumption tax to finance income tax cuts -- also in a 
middle-of-the-night news conference -- the Socialists threatened to bolt the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, Hosokawa withdrew his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who sided with the Socialists 
against Hosokawa's tax proposal, refused to resign or accept another Cabinet 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialists and the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party supported 
Takemura and warned that any Cabinet shuffle would split the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura condemned as "imperialistic" a Hosokawa proposal to amalgamate the 
coalition parties into a single parliamentary negotiating group to deal with 
the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister said he had scolded Takemura but had received assurances of 
future cooperation from the leader of the New Party Harbinger.

SENATE OKS BAN ON BENEFITS TO DRUG ADDICTS, ALCOHOLICS; LEGISLATION: PROBE 
FINDS DISABILITY, LUMP-SUM PAYMENTS BEING USED TO FEED SUBSTANCE ABUSE. BILL 
ALSO MAKES SOCIAL SECURITY AGENCY A SEPARATE UNIT. 
</P>

<P>
 The Senate on Wednesday approved a ban on federal disability benefits for drug 
addicts and alcoholics who do not receive treatment but use the payments to 
feed their habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate added the provision before passing a bill to make the Social 
Security Administration an independent federal agency instead of a unit of the 
Health and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure now goes to the House, where approval is expected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), who sponsored the amendment, said that only 3% 
of the 250,000 persons who now receive disability benefits related to their 
substance abuse are being treated for their addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Safeguards in the $1.4-billion federal program are so inadequate, Cohen said, 
that benefits are often paid to drug dealers or users who spend the money on 
heroin or cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Cohen added, alcoholics or drug addicts have squandered 
retroactive lump-sum payments of up to $20,000 on drinking sprees or on 
purchases of cars that they subsequently wrecked in drug-related crashes. One 
tavern owner in Denver, he said, received $160,000 in a recent year as 
"custodian" for alcoholic customers. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff investigation produced other examples of abuses: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Bakersfield, Calif., a drug addict receiving Supplemental Security Income 
benefits died of a lethal overdose from drugs purchased with thousands of 
dollars of retroactive payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * An alcoholic in Van Nuys, Calif., who was awarded lump-sum benefits of 
$26,000 bought two cars and a van, went on a drinking binge and wrecked all 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 * A California man who received $19,000 in retroactive payments used the money 
to buy cocaine in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen's amendment would require good-faith compliance with treatment programs, 
where available, and give addicts or alcoholics who receive benefits a priority 
for entrance into federally funded programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it would require that cash benefits be paid only to government 
institutions or private agencies who would manage the funds for the addicted 
person. A three-year limit on payments to substance abusers would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This amendment is intended to make sure that addicts and alcoholics get 
treatment for their addictions and to stop federal cash payments from going 
into a needle or into a bottle," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the Republican staff of the Senate Special Committee on 
Aging found that federal payments totaling $1.4 billion were made to 250,000 
drug addicts and alcoholics under the Social Security Disability and 
Supplemental Security Income programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, fewer than one-third were subject to any controls or monitoring of 
the funds they received. Fewer than 8,000 persons were known by the Social 
Security Administration to be in treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the number of persons receiving benefits for substance abuse has 
climbed by 150% in recent years, Cohen said: "The word is out that this is an 
easy way to get cash." 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying measure, making the Social Security Administration independent, 
was approved by the House in 1982 and 1986 but never before by the Senate.

U.S. OFFICIALS URGE OPIATE USE TO EASE CANCER PAIN IF NEEDED; MEDICINE: FEARS 
OF ADDICTION TO PAINKILLERS ARE UNFOUNDED, A HEALTH CARE AGENCY REPORTS. IT 
SAYS VERY OLD AND VERY YOUNG OFTEN ARE UNDERTREATED. 
</P>

 Cancer patients should receive opiates if necessary to control pain, and the 
fear of addiction should not be an obstacle to access, federal health officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the most persistent barrier to effective pain control is the 
unfounded belief" that using such drugs will result in addiction, the Agency 
for Health Care Policy and Research said as it issued new clinical practice 
guidelines for managing cancer pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, challenged 
this and several other long-held assumptions that it said have impeded efforts 
to ease the often considerable pain experienced by those battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer is diagnosed in more than 1 million Americans annually, and more than 8 
million either have cancer or a history of the disease. Pain can result from a 
tumor pressing on bone, nerves or body organs, or from treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone experiences pain but, in those who do, "unrelieved pain can 
produce unnecessary suffering," and can affect "a patient's ability to cope 
physically and psychologically" with the illness and the therapy, the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines will be widely distributed to physicians, nurses and other 
professionals involved in cancer care and to hospitals, hospices, cancer 
patient advocacy groups and others. 
</P>
<P>
 A special panel that drafted the guidelines said careful dosing and 
administration of the drugs, followed by tapering off once the medication no 
longer is needed, would prevent addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this tremendous confusion about addiction and substance abuse in this 
country -- confusing people involved in street crimes with the legitimate use 
of morphine and other opiates for pain relief," said Dr. Richard Payne of the 
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, co-chairman of the panel that drafted 
the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reviewed the scientific evidence exhaustively," Payne said. "There is very 
little or no evidence to support the fact that people who take these drugs for 
pain relief become addicted." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also debunked the idea that the very old and very young are less 
sensitive to pain than other age groups. People in those age groups are 
frequently undertreated -- the young because they are often unable to orally 
communicate their pain and the elderly because of the notion that pain is a 
normal part of aging, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel called for an aggressive approach to pain management but recommended 
that conservative treatment always be tried first. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the panel emphasized that patients be regarded as the best experts 
on their pain and urged that health professionals ask them regularly about 
their pain, just as they would about other aspects of their disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said pain can be controlled by simple and readily available means 
in about 90% of cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, much cancer pain goes unrelieved because health professionals 
are not trained to assess it and patients often are reluctant to report it, the 
agency said.

 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich took administrative action against Honeywell 
Inc., ruling that the firm discriminated against women in its hiring and 
promotion practices in the 1970s.Ruling on a case that was brought by Labor 
Department investigators in 1977, Reich said he had determined that Honeywell 
discriminated against thousands of women at offices, warehouses and factories 
around its Minneapolis-St. Paul base. He said he is asking an administrative 
law judge to determine what compensation, if any, Honeywell should pay. A 
Honeywell spokesman disputed the ruling, saying: "We have always taken the 
position that the allegations are unfounded."

 The White House said President Clinton retains full confidence in Associate 
Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell, whose legal billing practices are being scrutinized 
by Hubbell's former law firm.Clinton "stands by Webb. He believes him, believes 
his denial," Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. The vote of confidence 
followed a Washington Post report that the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, Ark., 
where Hubbell and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were once senior partners, 
is looking into charges that Hubbell overbilled clients or used the firm's 
money for personal expenses. In a statement, Hubbell denied ever overbilling a 
client.

 Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and the U.S. government squared off before the 
Supreme Court on whether federal judges can review government decisions to 
close military bases it considers obsolete.Specter argued that a judge should 
be allowed to consider a suit on the closure of the Philadelphia Naval 
Shipyard. He contended that hearings on the shipyard should be reopened because 
Navy leaders "fraudulently withheld" reports showing the long-term value of the 
base from the panel that selected which facilities would be closed. But 
Solicitor General Drew Days said that if one member of Congress can engage in 
"cherry picking" to protect his local base, the shutdown plan would fall apart.

SERB ATTACK BREACHES SARAJEVO TRUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebel Serbs launched three rocket-propelled grenades Wednesday at government 
troop positions in Sarajevo, violating the U.N. cease-fire and raising fears 
that the city's recent calm will prove to be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the capital, Serbs pounded two Muslim enclaves and continued to block 
relief convoys -- despite their encouraging promise a day earlier to open an 
airport in the region to relief flights. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said Serbs fired the three grenades at Bosnian positions around 
the Jewish cemetery in downtown Sarajevo. A U.N. spokesman, Lt. Col. Bill 
Aikman, said Serbian artillery also fired Tuesday on the Muslim town of Breza, 
just north of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 While in both cases the Serbs clearly had breached the 3-week-old cease-fire, 
the attacks apparently were not serious enough to trigger a North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization air strike under the alliance's Feb. 9 ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Grenade launchers were not listed among the heavy weapons that had to be 
removed from a 12-mile radius around Sarajevo, and Tuesday's attack came from 
outside the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials quoted Serbs as saying they fired the grenades because 
Muslim-led government forces were violating the cease-fire themselves by 
reinforcing their trenches.

SERGEANT JAILED FOR HOMOSEXUAL ACTS ON AIR BASE

<P>
 A U.S. Air Force sergeant was sentenced to 60 days in military jail after 
being found guilty of illegal homosexual acts at an American base in Germany, a 
U.S. military spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The court-martial was part of a military investigation into homosexual 
activities at Ramstein Air Base involving eight U.S. airmen, including a 
high-ranking officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said Sgt. Mark Rayford of the 86th Operations Support Squadron 
at Ramstein was stripped of his rank, fined $1,000 and sentenced to 60 days' 
confinement at a U.S. correctional facility at Mannheim. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ramstein military court Tuesday evening found him guilty of sodomy, 
solicitation to commit sodomy and indecent exposure, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayford was the fourth airman to be court-martialed after the investigation 
uncovered homosexual activities last year at the giant base near Kaiserslautern 
in southwestern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton last year signed into law a policy of "don't ask, don't 
tell" under which gay men and lesbian women can serve in the military so long 
as they keep their sexual orientation private. The law is expected to be 
challenged in court.

IN RUSSIA, BOSNIA SERB LEADER BLASTS U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, blasted the United States 
on Wednesday for usurping the role of the United Nations in making peace in the 
former Yugoslav federation, saying Russia is a more "impartial and reliable" 
mediator in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that the United States of America could be possibly at the same 
time biased in favor of Muslims and impartial," he said on the second day of a 
visit to Russia, a traditional patron that has pressured the Bosnian Serbs into 
two major concessions that the United Nations has been unable to extract from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lashing back, Karadzic said the United Nations should not be "abandoned," 
leaving only one power -- presumably the United States -- to arbitrate the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters in English and Russian, Karadzic said he is still 
studying the agreement signed Tuesday in Washington between the government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bosnian Croat separatists to form a federated state, 
whose boundaries would include large chunks of territory now under Serbian 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Outmaneuvered by both Washington and Moscow, Karadzic touted Slavic 
solidarity, then headed off to watch a soccer match with Russia's best-known 
booster of the Serbs, ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, who has said that any NATO air strikes against the Serbs in 
Bosnia would be tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia, had met with 
Karadzic during a recent visit to the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand each other quite well," Zhirinovsky said. "He speaks in Russian 
without translators, and we are satisfied with each other's positions." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be best for Russia to be neutral in the conflict in the former 
Yugoslav republics, Zhirinovsky said. "But in principle, we are more on the 
side of the Slavic peoples and Orthodox peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 He also heaped scorn on the United States' latest efforts to try to resolve 
the Muslim-Croat conflict. "What is new in the American initiative? There is 
nothing new," Zhirinovsky said. "They are threatening, setting conditions. The 
best initiative would be to leave Bosnia, Herzegovina and Montenegro (the last 
of which composes, with Serbia, the rump Yugoslavia) in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party's "shadow foreign minister," 
lawmaker Alexei V. Mitrofanov, said that, in principle, they support a 
withdrawal of all foreign troops from the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitrofanov said he believes that "the United States has an interest in keeping 
up this source of destabilization in the center of Europe." Nevertheless, he 
called the Russian initiative to send peacekeepers in return for Serbian 
concessions "a step in the direction we pointed out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good to have Russian troops in Bosnia," Mitrofanov said. "To try 
bombing Bosnia while there are 400 Russian paratroopers in blue helmets there 
is to walk on a tightrope." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, while expressing deep sympathy with its traditional Serbian allies 
and fellow Orthodox Christians -- thus depriving Zhirinovsky and his 
nationalist allies of sole political ownership of the emotional issue -- Moscow 
has twice in the last two weeks forced the Bosnian Serbs to bow to 
international demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian promises to send peacekeepers to Sarajevo helped persuade the Bosnian 
Serbs to comply with a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ultimatum to remove 
or surrender heavy artillery inside a 12-mile zone around Sarajevo by Feb. 21. 
And on Tuesday, Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev 
announced that the Bosnian Serbs will allow the Tuzla airport to reopen, 
provided Russian observers are present to guarantee that only humanitarian 
cargo is brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter concession, which came only a day after NATO shot down four Bosnian 
Serb warplanes, was "difficult for them," said Vladimir F. Shumeiko, chairman 
of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament.

 U.S. and Vietnamese negotiators have agreed in principle on the opening of 
liaison offices and on U.S. war claims against Vietnam, the Hanoi government 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said two days of talks, critical 
steps in establishing diplomatic relations, ended "with a very positive 
result."The statement said more meetings will be held later to finalize the 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations -- together with what the U.S. State Department called a 
"productive exchange of views" in New York on human rights -- marked a 
promising start to a new chapter in ties opened when Washington scrapped the 
19-year economic embargo against Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington will be upgraded to embassies if 
relations continue to improve, officials have said.

PACKWOOD LOSES BID TO RETAIN DIARIES -- IN COURT OF LAST RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Packwood lost his last bid to keep his private diaries out of the 
hands of Senate investigators as Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on 
Wednesday refused the Oregon Republican's request to shield the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The embattled senator, accused of sexually harassing former employees, has 
contended that it would violate his "right to privacy" under the Constitution 
if he were forced to reveal his personal diaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rehnquist, acting alone, said it is "quite clear" that a majority of 
justices do not agree with that view of the law. Neither the 4th Amendment's 
ban on unreasonable searches nor the 5th Amendment's protection against 
self-incrimination provides grounds for blocking a legitimate Senate subpoena, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief justice noted that Packwood may have undercut his own case by 
"tampering" with the diary tapes and transcripts. This suggests an attempt to 
obstruct justice, Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 A former secretary, who since 1969 had transcribed Packwood's taped 
recollections, told Senate investigators last year that some tapes and 
transcripts had been altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's court order clears the way for a former federal judge to begin 
examining the diaries to see what is relevant to the Ethics Committee inquiry. 
Kenneth W. Starr, a widely respected lawyer and former U.S. solicitor general 
in the George Bush Administration, was chosen by the Senate to review the 
diaries and eliminate strictly private matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Rehnquist's order, Packwood issued a statement saying that he 
is concerned about a "loss of civil liberties" demonstrated by his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "A precedent has now been set that will not protect the private thoughts and 
property of American citizens from government snooping," he said. "No one's 
private papers are safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood's case will be the subject of a nationally broadcast television 
interview Friday night. In the interview, Packwood says he has had 
"professional counseling" for his drinking and sexual problems. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Senate investigators, 29 women, most of them former employees, 
have said that Packwood sexually harassed them. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, the senator says that he had "hugged and kissed and been 
hugged and kissed by hundreds of women, without sexual overtones to it" during 
his Senate career.

HALF OF TRIPS TO EMERGENCY ROOMS FOUND NOT URGENT; HEALTH: FAMILY DOCTORS COULD 
HANDLE PROBLEMS AT ONE-THIRD OF THE EXPENSE. GOVERNMENT STUDY SHOWS HOW 
UNINSURED AMERICANS PUSH UP COSTS FOR OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half of the 90 million annual visits to the nation's hospital 
emergency rooms are for non-emergencies that can be treated by a family doctor 
-- at a third of the cost, a national survey found Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as many people visited an emergency room for sore throats and coughs as 
for chest pains, said the study by the National Center for Health Statistics, 
an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are likely to figure in the health care reform debate because 
they offer vivid proof that most uninsured Americans have no regular form of 
medical care and because they demonstrate how those Americans' lack of coverage 
pushes up insurance costs for others. An estimated 38 million Americans have no 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found, for instance, that those with the highest rate of 
non-emergency visits were under age 24 -- the group least likely to have 
insurance. Sixty-one percent of their visits were not emergencies -- compared 
to the overall rate of 55%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study shows how emergency rooms have become the 'family doctor' for too 
many Americans," HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said. "But emergency rooms are not 
intended to deliver routine medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patients at emergency rooms don't get the timely, preventive services that 
come with regular medical care. And the cost is three times higher than visits 
to the doctor's office." 
</P>
<P>
 The high rate of non-urgent use of emergency rooms is not surprising, said 
Kate Perrin, an official of the American College of Emergency Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a tremendous and growing reliance on emergency departments to 
provide care for segments of our population that are no longer covered in 
traditional ways," Perrin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high incidence of non-emergencies, the patients treated were given 
an abundance of diagnostic tests, many of them expensive. The study said 73.7% 
of visitors had their blood pressure taken, 28.7% had blood work-ups, 16.8% 
received chest X-rays, 13.2% had electrocardiograms and 2.4% underwent CAT 
scans or magnetic resonance imaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The study expanded upon two studies released last year, one by the General 
Accounting Office, the other by the American Hospital Assn. The GAO study 
concluded that 43% of visits to emergency rooms in 1990 were not urgent. The 
AHA study said one of three emergency room visits were made by people seeking 
primary care. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest study covered 1992 and was based on a sampling of 432 hospitals 
around the country, said author Linda F. McCaig, a researcher at the center. By 
design, hospitals that might skew the results were excluded, such as federal 
facilities or those with a preponderance of chronically ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said 42% of all visitors had Medicare or Medicaid coverage and 
another 36% had private insurance. Most of the rest, McCaig said, were 
uninsured and could not pay for their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his drive to overhaul the health care system, President Clinton has made 
universal coverage his guiding principle. Administration officials have 
stressed that the cost of treating the uninsured is passed on to the insured 
through higher fees. Such cost-shifting will continue, experts agree, unless 
all Americans have insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, reporters asked Clinton about two new polls that show 
significant erosion in public support for his health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could it be otherwise?" Clinton said. "I mean, look at the millions and 
millions and millions of dollars that have been spent by interest groups to 
trash the plan, people that don't want to assume any responsibility for their 
employees, people that don't want to assume any responsibility for providing 
basic health care, people that think they can get just a little better deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the President said: "I still am actually pretty optimistic about 
this, because what happened is, every time I get a chance to speak to the 
American people about it, support goes back up, like it did at the State of the 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington Post-ABC News poll found that, for the first time, more people 
disapprove of Clinton's plan than approve, by a 48%-44% margin. And a CNN-USA 
Today poll found an 11-point decline in support for the plan since a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee decided to 
bypass the customary step of having a subcommittee consider the plan before 
sending it to the full committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the decision is in the interest of time. Health subcommittee Chairman 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said he and Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) 
are concerned that they will not have the cost estimates they will need to 
draft their version for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a larger problem is with the moderate and conservative Democrats on 
the panel who oppose the President's plan to require employers to provide their 
workers with health coverage, as well as the premium caps in the measure.

POSTAL SERVICE SEEN LIKELY TO ASK PRICE HIKE FOR FIRST-CLASS STAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Postal Service board of governors is likely Monday to propose an increase 
of 3 or 4 cents in the price of a first-class stamp, with the rates to become 
effective early in 1995, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the independent Postal Rate Commission, which has up to 10 
months to make a decision, the hike would be the first since February, 1991, 
when the first-class stamp rose from 25 cents to the current 29 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of governors also will call for price increases in all other 
categories of mail, but precise rates are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful Mailers Council -- which includes newspaper and magazine 
publishers, greeting card firms, banks, utilities and direct marketers -- has 
called for a 10.3% increase for all classes of mail. That proposal would 
translate into a 3-cent hike for first-class stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service had a deficit of $1.7 billion last year and officials have 
decided that they must seek additional revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rate hikes normally are spaced three years apart but Postmaster General Marvin 
Runyon's aggressive cost-cutting program, which included early retirement for 
48,000 postal workers, has enabled the system to operate for an additional year 
without raising prices. Runyon saved the system $1.8 billion last year, 
according to Postal Service estimates.

EAST PUMMELED AGAIN BY SNOW, SLEET AND RAIN

<P>
 Another major storm system slammed the Eastern Seaboard on Wednesday, dumping 
snow, sleet and rain from Maine to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty sick of this," said Rhonda Lynch, a legal secretary in 
Martinsburg, W. Va."We're hoping that if March is coming in like a lion, it'll 
go out like a lamb." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as two feet of snow was possible in the hills of western Maryland and 
south-central Pennsylvania, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The big storm extended along most of the Eastern Seaboard and Appalachians, 
with snow edging into New England at the same time Florida had thunderstorms 
and at least one tornado. Flooding in the Sunshine State brought out snakes and 
floating clusters of fire ants. 
</P>
<P>
 As the storm slowly chugged up the coast, Maryland was pelted with rain and 
snow, and New Jersey got a nasty mixture of several inches of snow topped with 
sleet and rain. Massachusetts' heaviest snowfall was not expected until this 
morning's rush hour. Up to a foot of snow was expected in the western end of 
the state, with 20-foot seas along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Gov. George F. Allen declared a state of emergency after the state 
was hit with snow in the north and freezing rain in the south. There were more 
than 170,000 power outages statewide, and numerous roads in the southern part 
of the state were blocked by falling trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten inches of snow fell Wednesday on Virginia's central Blue Ridge near 
Charlottesville and Winchester. Up to five inches of snow in northern 
Virginia's Washington suburbs snarled traffic on Interstates 95 and 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools were closed in parts of western and northern Virginia, including 
Caroline County, where students have missed about two weeks of class this 
winter.

SIMPSON SEEKS 5-YEAR CUT IN LEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), an influential voice in the perennial 
immigration debate on Capitol Hill, Wednesday unveiled legislation to lower 
temporarily the number of legal immigrants admitted to the United States and to 
increase the penalties for those who smuggle immigrants into the country 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by statistics indicating that immigrants now make up 35% of the 
nation's annual population growth, Simpson proposed cutting the number of legal 
immigrants to 500,000 from 675,000 in each of the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary reduction, he told reporters, would give authorities a breathing 
period in which to focus their efforts on stemming illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a decade of high immigration coupled with a tough recession and high 
unemployment, it is time to take a breather. In some particularly hard-hit 
areas of the country, there is a growing concern about the heavy costs to the 
taxpayer, not only of illegal immigration, but legal immigration as well," said 
Simpson, ranking Republican on the Senate subcommittee that deals with 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's bill also would cap the number of refugees who could be given asylum 
in the United States at 80,000 annually, unless Congress raises the limit for a 
"crisis or an emergency." It would double the penalty for smuggling illegal 
immigrants into the country to 10 years imprisonment and provide for the death 
penalty if an immigrant dies during a smuggling attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is only one of several legislative initiatives likely to be 
debated this year as lawmakers, responding to public pressure, begin pushing 
for a comprehensive reform of the nation's immigration laws.

IN A MAN'S WORLD; WOMEN WERE A NOVELTY WHEN PATRICIA FOGERSON JOINED THE LAPD; 
'YOU JUST KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND KEPT GOING,' SHE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of Patricia A. Fogerson's 25-year career with the Los Angeles Police 
Department is the chronicle of a delicate and somewhat confusing effort to 
negotiate a place in the police fraternity -- where the pressures to conform 
were enormous and neither the men nor the women were quite sure how to act. 
</P>
<P>
 She started with the department in 1969, when a woman's only escape from desk 
work was in juvenile. She went on to become the first female drill instructor 
at the Police Academy in the mid '80s and retired last week as a detective in 
the bunco-forgery division. 
</P>
<P>
 She went through the academy twice, the second time to gain promotions after 
legal action forced the department to put women in the field. The instructors 
didn't bother to assume even a veneer of welcome -- and one, she says, even 
tried to sabotage her scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Fogerson matter of factly recalls how, during a physical aptitude exam, the 
instructor deliberately switched her running time with that of another woman 
who didn't perform as well. Another instructor lectured the class about how 
women just didn't have the guts and strength to be police officers. Female cops 
would, he assured the recruits, prove fatal to their male partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years before, Police Chief Ed Davis had declared, "When the L.A. 
Rams hire . . . women tackles, then I'll put women in police cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Women tried to cope. "You just kept your mouth shut and kept going and did the 
best you could," Fogerson said. In the patrol car, some of her early partners 
didn't know whether to treat her like a sister, a date or a colleague. One male 
officer insisted on opening the door for her and buying her dinner. Another 
officer, with whom she worked for only one day, confided in her about a 
longtime extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pouring his heart out to me. To this day I don't know his name," 
Fogerson says, still amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the partner who introduced her to his wife, saying, "This is 
what I'm working with." 
</P>
<P>
 To get along, Fogerson became one of the guys. She cracked jokes about her 
flat chest, showed up at roll call smoking a cigar and once ripped open her 
shirt to reveal a T-shirt bearing the image of two strategically placed fried 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was working in the Hollywood Division in the early '80s, a supervisor 
would regularly grab her and force her head into his lap. "I didn't even 
realize that was sexual harassment. I didn't feel offended," said Fogerson, who 
developed neck problems as a result of the routine. "It was always funny, 'Ha, 
Ha.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I acquiesced," she said, adding that she now believes the behavior was 
inappropriate. "Somewhere along the line, I got educated. . . . Looking back on 
it, psychologically I probably did it to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where does sex harassment start?" Fogerson asked. "Where do you draw the 
line?" 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, Fogerson says women are now accepted and treated well in the 
department. Indeed, she complains that they are favored at the academy, where 
she says they are given more chances than men. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she acknowledges that sexual harassment of female officers 
can be found in every division in the department -- and is in some sense 
condoned because supervisors don't take adequate steps to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Department is still a man's world, and if you go in there and 
don't believe that, you don't see the big picture."

LEBANESE CAB DRIVER ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON JEWISH STUDENTS IN N.Y. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested a 28-year-old Lebanese cab driver Wednesday and charged him 
with being the gunman who staged a bloody attack on a van packed with Jewish 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 After witnesses helped reconstruct the license plate of the car used in the 
attack on the Brooklyn Bridge, police arrested Rashad Baz at his home in 
Brooklyn and charged him with 15 counts of attempted murder, four counts of 
assault and several weapons possession violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers also seized a small arsenal of high-powered weapons during the 
arrest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested later were two Jordanians, Hlai Mohammad, 32, and Bassam Reyati, 27, 
both of Brooklyn. They were charged with hindering prosecution of a crime and 
possession of a weapon. A police spokesman said officials believe that they 
helped Baz dispose of the guns and the car used in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which left 
one young man brain-dead and another critically wounded and raised fears that 
the gunman was retaliating for the massacre of Palestinian worshipers by an 
extremist Jew in the West Bank city of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are comfortable he is the shooter at the bridge yesterday," Police 
Commissioner William Bratton said at a City Hall news conference, where the 
first arrest was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the search for a motive continued, detectives indicated they were 
questioning additional witnesses and people who knew Baz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not ruling out anything at this juncture," Bratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said members of the city's Arab American community 
had provided help in the investigation and that the arrest sent a signal: "Our 
streets are not open to bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a remarkable result to have the shooter in custody," said Manhattan 
Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau, whose office will prosecute the case. "The 
investigation is not over. There is a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives who arrested Baz, who entered the United States on a student visa 
in 1984, found no political literature, but they recovered a cache of weapons, 
including two 9-millimeter pistols -- the type used to shoot at the van -- a 
fully loaded shotgun known in the drug trade as a "street sweeper," a 
semiautomatic rifle, a silencer, a stun gun and a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 A blue Chevrolet described by witnesses as the vehicle used in the shooting 
was recovered in a Brooklyn body shop. Shell casings from the kind of bullets 
fired at the van were found in the auto, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police ballistics experts conducted tests, comparing bullets fired from the 
seized weapons to bullets recovered from the van. 
</P>
<P>
 The white van with 15 Hasidic students was attacked Tuesday by a lone gunman 
firing two pistols. The students were returning from a Manhattan hospital where 
Grand Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the leader of the Lubavitcher sect, had 
undergone cataract surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Four students were hurt in three separate bursts of gunfire -- on an approach 
ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge and later in the middle of the span. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians said Aaron Halberstam, 20, one of the victims, was on life-support 
with an irreversible brain trauma. They said that the outlook for his recovery 
was "zero." 
</P>
<P>
 A second student, who was also shot in the head, was in critical condition 
with an "extremely poor" prognosis, according to officials at at St. Vincent's 
Hospital in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said that two other wounded students would recover. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton telephoned Halberstam's family Wednesday. "My prayers are 
with them, with their son and with all of those affected by this spasm of 
brutal violence," Clinton said. "It is an outrage that this crime, which has 
overtones of a hate crime, could occur in our American community. It is a 
tragedy that such a tender, intelligent boy could be the victim of such 
brutality and immutable violence."

WALL STREET TOUGHS OUT A ROLLER-COASTER DAY; BLUE CHIPS PLUMMET, THEN REGAIN 
GROUND, AS BONDS RECOVER

 Stocks and bonds suffered deep selloffs early Wednesday as investor pessimism 
appeared to reach a crescendo, only to give way to a wave of buying that 
produced stunning comebacks in both markets by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 After five days of losses, the Dow industrial average was well on its way to a 
sixth losing session early Wednesday, falling more than 50 points in the first 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But a turnaround that began shortly thereafter built steam as the day wore on, 
and the Dow closed with a gain of 22.51 points at 3,831.74. The broad market, 
however, remained weak, though it too fought back from its lows. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields on 30-year Treasury issues rocketed as high as 
6.92% overseas before U.S. markets opened Wednesday, up from Tuesday's close of 
6.78%. 
</P>
<P>
 But in New York trading, the T-bond yield moved gradually lower throughout the 
day and finished at 6.77%. Shorter-term yields also eased. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said downbeat economic statistics released Wednesday helped calm the 
inflation jitters that have bedeviled markets in recent weeks, as investors 
have focused on the potential for rising prices in the increasingly robust 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important than the economic reports was the spreading feeling early 
Wednesday that both stock and bond markets were overdue for at least a 
temporary snap-back, analysts said. In Wall Street parlance, the bond market in 
particular "was very oversold," said Philip Roth, analyst at Dean Witter 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year T-bond yield has zoomed from a 21-year low of 5.79% last fall, and 
was 6.35% as recently as Feb. 4. That was when the Federal Reserve Board 
officially boosted short-term interest rates by 0.25 point -- the Fed's 
acknowledgment that the economy was growing fast enough to warrant restraining 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market has plunged as interest rates have rocketed. At 3,831, the 
Dow is off 3.7% from its all-time high reached Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters in recent weeks have warned investors that the U.S. market 
is ripe for a classic drop, or "correction," of 5% to 10%, as markets worldwide 
suffer profit taking and as stock prices adjust to the new reality of a strong 
economy and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, well-known Lehman Bros. market guru Elaine Garzarelli said on 
CNBC-TV that the U.S. stocks could fall as much as 10% in the current setback. 
She had previously said the correction range would be 4% to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kevin Logan, economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said U.S. 
bond yields may finally have risen far enough to attract buyers, despite 
inflation concerns. As rates have surged in recent weeks, many potential buyers 
have remained frozen simply because of the severity of bonds' selloff, Logan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders have blamed the sharp rise in bond yields on dumping of bonds by 
high-powered speculators, such as so-called hedge funds that operate worldwide. 
Those funds appeared blindsided by the Fed's rate hike, causing them to 
jettison bonds here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, markets have been battered by fears that hedge funds' heavy use of 
derivative securities, such as futures and options, could cause unexpected 
losses throughout the world financial system as the funds unwind their trades. 
</P>
<P>
 Those worries struck again Wednesday, with rumors that Bankers Trust of New 
York had suffered major losses in derivatives. Its shares were delayed opening. 
Once trading began the stock fell as low as 76 7/8, then closed at 78 1/2, off 
2 1/4. The bank said only that "operations thus far for 1994 have been 
profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts warn that the markets' jitters may continue for a while, and 
that stocks are vulnerable to deeper profit-taking even if interest rates 
stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, despite the Dow index's rebound, most broad indexes closed 
lower. Also, losers outnumbered winners by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, although the margin had been 5 to 1 early in the day.  
</P>
<P>
 Further declines in many foreign stock markets had weighed on Wall Street at 
the opening Wednesday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index dropped 471.85 points to 
19,744.77 on renewed fears of a U.S.-Japan trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index sank 46.72 points to 2,020.33, while London's 
FTSE-100 index fell 20.5 points to 3,248.1. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, however, the Bolsa index rebounded with the Dow, rising 48.53 
points to 2,562.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues caught bargain-hunters' eyes, pulling the Dow up. Winners 
included GM, up 2 3/8 to 60 1/2; Caterpillar, up 3 1/8 to 112; Kodak, up 1 1/4 
to 44 1/4, and Alcoa, up 2 to 76 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil issues also rose, with Chevron up 2 1/8 to 87 1/4, Mobil up 1 5/8 to 80 
and Exxon up 1 to 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some technology issues gained, including Motorola, up 2 5/8 to 106; Lotus, 
up 3 to 72 1/2, and Autodesk, up 1 5/8 to 59 3/8. But AST Research plunged 5 
1/4 to 23 1/2 after it warned that revenue growth will slow in the near-term. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, many financial issues remained weak. SunAmerica fell 7/8 to 
34 1/2, Citicorp lost 3/4 to 39 5/8, First Chicago lost 1 1/4 to 47 and 
PaineWebber eased 1/2 to 26 1/8. But the Dow utility index managed to rally, 
adding 2.24 points to 211.64. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished lower against most foreign currencies, but managed to 
recoup some losses triggered by the release of German money supply figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign exchange traders said the dollar plummeted after Germany reported that 
its M3 money supply measure jumped 20.6% on an annualized basis in January 
compared to the average rate in the 1993 fourth quarter. The Bundesbank said 
the figure was distorted by special factors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many investors took the number as a sign that German inflation could 
come roaring back. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's cautious central bank, anxious to choke off inflation, has lowered 
interest rates very slowly and had been expected to drop them again soon, but 
that may not happen now. A halt to interest rate cuts in Germany could support 
the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed at 1.704 marks in New York, down from 1.708 Tuesday, after 
falling below the psychologically important level of 1.700. It also fell 
against the Japanese yen, closing at 104.15, down from 104.60 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gold eased on the New York Comex to $377.80 an ounce, down 50 
cents. Silver was up 0.3 cent to $5.28.

CAREER LINKS; BUSINESSWOMEN ARE PUTTING ON GOLF SHOES TO GET AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many businesswomen trying to break through the "glass ceiling" that hinders 
their advancement in corporate America are finding that a good way to do it is 
with golf club in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while women executives typically take up the sport to gain an equal 
footing with male colleagues, many of them find the best rewards come from the 
networks and contacts they make with other women they meet on the links. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women in our organization find they not only generate business on the course 
with men, but with women. . . . As women progress in owning businesses and are 
successful in the marketplace, they are more social and interested in bonding 
and networking," said Annette Roe, a Century City law firm administrator who 
helped establish the Los Angeles chapter of the Executive Women's Golf League. 
This may be particularly beneficial in the Los Angeles area, which is second 
only to New York in the number of female business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are more apt to share their ideas and nurture," Roe said, adding that 
five hours on a golf course provides plenty of time for sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesswomen's soaring interest in golf has helped make the still-fledgling 
Executive Women's league and others like it booming successes. Nancy Oliver 
formed the group in West Palm Beach, Fla., less than three years ago to learn 
how to play golf; she has since set aside her public relations business and 
devotes her time to overseeing the growth of the league to more than 60 
chapters nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of the women who join Roe and Oliver on the course confirms a 
finding of a study on the glass ceiling by executive search firm Korn/Ferry 
International and UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management. In comments on 
that study, released this week, many women said golf was career-enhancing, 
helping them gain entrance into the informal "club" of executives. Glass 
ceiling is the term given to the hurdles that women and minorities find largely 
keep them out of the executive suite or boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women who have reached the upper ranks of senior management are finding that 
golf gives them an advantage in socializing with their male peers on a business 
and personal level," Caroline Nahas, a managing partner of Korn/Ferry's Los 
Angeles office, said in a statement. Golf "gives them an entree to that 
informal club, helping build relationships outside the office that are critical 
to being completely accepted within a corporate culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Harris, a golfer for four years who now runs her own company, Harris 
Financial Advisors in Torrance, said golfing "allows me to find a common ground 
with a lot of male executives. If they're not interested in talking about 
investing or about their profession, we can always talk about where we played 
last." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anne Ronce, a San Francisco activist and writer on glass ceiling issues, 
said: "If someone likes to play golf and thinks it helps, more power to them. 
They should do that; it's a lifetime sport and it's wonderful. But the larger 
issue is: Are women being evaluated and promoted fairly? Is golf the solution 
to the problem of the glass ceiling? No, and it's insulting to think that it 
could be." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, golf -- a still predominantly male game -- has its own glass ceiling 
of sorts, say women who have gone a few rounds on the links. Many private 
country clubs across the nation still bar women from holding full memberships; 
most still restrict women's tee times or in other ways make it difficult for 
women to be full participants with men in golfing's social environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf is not a haven for women executives, said Marcia Chambers, a contributing 
editor to Golf Digest magazine who has been covering the sport for five years 
and is now writing a book about the problems women face on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "First you have to get in, and women are often barred at the clubhouse door," 
Chambers said. And when they are not allowed on the greens at the most popular 
and convenient tee times for business-oriented golf, "it puts the woman 
corporate executive in a difficult position as to how corporate clients might 
view her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesswomen, like most women golfers, spend most of their golfing time on 
public or daily-fee golf courses rather than private courses, statistics from 
the National Golf Foundation show. Because women spend more money on equipment 
and clothing than men (they buy for themselves and their mates), and now 
account for more than one-fifth of all golfers and 37% of all beginning 
golfers, some golf-related businesses have begun catering to women, and clubs 
are easing up on restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 But more women are finding that golfing with the guys may not even be the best 
way to spend their time on the course. Beginning businesswomen golfers "learn 
to golf so they ultimately can play with the men," Oliver said. "But what they 
find when they take up the game of golf and meet other women . . . they learn 
together, laugh together, they become friends and find that the other women 
have the potential to provide them with as much business as a man can." Women 
Golfers 
</P>
<P>
 The number of women who golf peaked in 1990. Women make up 21.8% of all 
golfers.

 1992: 5.41 million

WALL STREET TOUGHS OUT A ROLLER-COASTER DAY; MOTHER NATURE PUTS TWIST ON 
ECONOMIC REPORTS FOR JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bad weather in the Northeast and the earthquake in Southern California helped 
reduce personal incomes in January and sent new-home sales plunging 20%, the 
Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When combined with a third study that said help-wanted advertising also fell 
in January, analysts said the reports show that the economy is cooling from its 
feverish growth rate of 7.5% in the last three months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors on Wall Street, still nervous about reports Tuesday that hinted at 
an inflation comeback, initially sent stocks and bonds into a nose-dive 
Wednesday. But later, the markets reversed direction after investors generally 
interpreted the reports as signs that the economy was slowing and inflationary 
pressures were easing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed Wednesday with a gain of 22.51 points, 
while the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond -- a barometer of long-term 
inflation trends -- closed at 6.77%, down 0.01% from Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some panic selling early," said Alfred Goldman, an analyst with A. 
G. Edwards & Sons, a St. Louis-based brokerage firm catering to individual 
investors. "But then people calmed down and realized that the news was pretty 
good because it showed the economy was slowing down a little." 
</P>
<P>
 The 0.3% drop in Americans' income in January was the first decline since 
July, but analysts said Mother Nature made matters look worse than they really 
are, according to the Commerce Department's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages and salaries actually rose a healthy 1% in January from December, the 
report said. But the quake caused $42.5 billion in uninsured losses -- 
including a $29.9-billion drop in the rent that landlords collect -- and that 
helped to push overall income lower. 
</P>
<P>
 A decline in subsidies to farmers and higher Social Security payroll taxes 
also hurt personal earnings in January, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such onetime influences made the overall decline misleading because it 
"doesn't reflect fewer dollars in people's pockets," said economist Mark Vitner 
of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. If the effects of the quake and those 
other events were left out, Vitner said personal income would have climbed 
0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 In another twist to its report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending 
actually rose 0.5% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $4.53 trillion. Spending on services, from airline travel to hospital 
visits, jumped 0.9%, while spending on big-ticket items, such as cars and 
appliances, climbed a more modest 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings rate dropped to 3.3% in January from 4.2% in December, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 New-home sales were hurt by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and severe 
snowstorms on the East Coast, dropping sales 20.1% from torrid levels in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Many builders in Southern California said their sales screeched to a halt in 
the first week or two after the quake, while prospective buyers on the East 
Coast were reluctant to visit new housing tracts in sub-zero weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also had a very strong December, so some letdown could be expected," said 
Michael Carliner, chief economist for the National Assn. of Home Builders in 
Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report that also suggested the economy may be cooling, the 
Conference Board said its monthly Help-Wanted Advertising Index dropped four 
points in January from December. 
</P>
<P>
 The business-funded research group, which tracks advertising volume at 51 
major newspapers across the country, said advertising was strongest in the 
Rocky Mountain states. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said its final figures show that 
the U.S. trade deficit jumped more than 37% to $132 billion last year from 
$96.1 billion in 1992. It was the largest trade gap since 1987. The trade 
deficit with Japan reached a record $60.4 billion, up from $50.5 billion in 
1992. Personal Income and Spending

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: WHINING ABOUT FCC ROLLBACK WON'T PAVE INFORMATION 
HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 " Oh what a tangled web we weave When first we practice to deceive " 
</P>
<P>
 "Ill-advised, improperly based, probably illegal and probably 
unconstitutional," fulminated TCI's John Malone about the Federal 
Communications Commission's proposed cable rate cuts, which purportedly 
cratered his company's multibillion-dollar multimedia merger with Bell 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unsettled regulatory climate made it too difficult for the parties to 
value the future today," Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith coolly explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's decision "did not in any way make the future of the cable industry 
more unsettled," insisted FCC Chairman Reed Hundt. "Our adoption of a 
comprehensive set of regulations clarified the industry's future." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. . . . Still, you almost have to feel sorry for Malone and 
Smith. Barely five months ago, they were heralded as gutsy visionaries who were 
going to reinvent telecommunications -- the Wilbur and Orville of multimedia.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, they're portrayed in the business media as just a couple of 
hype-spewing klutzes who couldn't close a deal. Fickle, fickle, fickle. . . . 
Those clever Wall Street analysts, of course, knew it all along. 
</P>
<P>
 What's so baffling, however, is not that the Bell Atlantic/Tele-Communications 
Inc. acquisition fell apart, but the bizarre reason the parties offered for its 
collapse. An excellent case could be made that the deal collapsed because Bell 
Atlantic shares -- and then TCI shares -- eroded because investors (for 
whatever reasons) felt the deal was just too pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Bell Atlantic and TCI simply couldn't come to terms. That's a 
good, honorable reason for a deal to fail. You would think Malone and Smith 
would be comfortable saying that. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Bell Atlantic and TCI blamed the FCC's proposed 7% cable rate 
rollback -- which the entire cable industry knew was coming -- as the deal 
breaker. That is downright weird. Are they being serious? Or are they telling a 
little multibillion-dollar white lie that will come back to haunt them? 
</P>
<P>
 Of all people, Bell Atlantic's Smith should know that telecommunications 
deregulation over the past 12 years has aimed to promote competition, cut 
prices and encourage innovation. Thanks to divestiture, competition and new 
technologies, AT&T has cut its long-distance rates more than 40% over the last 
decade. Emerging competition is now beginning to cut prices for cellular phone 
services. If you want to talk about truly vicious price competition, look at 
the personal computing industry John and Ray claimed they wanted their massive 
multimedia merger to embrace. PC and peripheral prices regularly plummet 15% a 
year. Hey, you can even rent a hit movie for $1.99 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 So when competition finally comes to local cable and telephone companies, do 
Ray Smith and John Malone think they'll only have to cut their telecom prices 
by a measly 7%? The fact that they blame government regulators for blowing 
their deal reveals that these guys are out of touch with the marketplace they 
ostensibly want to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did they think cable got itself re-regulated in the first place? Because 
everybody loved their local cable company and felt they were getting terrific 
service? These guys are whining that they need to charge their customers more 
in order to pave their (groan) information superhighway. Sorry, but that's not 
what a competitive marketplace is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 But why should that be a surprise? TCI has no real competition in most of its 
markets. It's a legal monopoly. So is Bell Atlantic. Malone and Smith may be 
visionaries, but they are practicing monopolists. They're not comfortable with 
the concept that the future of their industry lies not just in providing 
mind-boggling interactive multimedia services, but in price wars as intense as 
anything the airlines have waged. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait till the Frank Lorenzo of cable TV emerges. Then let's see how tough a 
competitor John Malone or Ray Smith really is. Consider the FCC rate cut an 
interesting test of how local cable companies might respond to future price 
competition. TCI and Bell Atlantic have failed that test with flying colors. 
The message is that a merged TCI/Bell Atlantic wasn't prepared to compete on 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if the FCC's rate cut wasn't the real reason for the 
breakup, then you have the leader of the nation's largest cable company and the 
chairman of one of the largest telephone companies telling what can politely be 
called an untruth. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would they do this? Do they believe that blaming "the government" will 
help them in some way? 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the nation's broadcasters have been ardently lobbying Congress for 
the right to take new frequency spectrum allotted to high-density television 
and use it, if they like, for pay TV or other services. If not, they make no 
promises about any new service being developed. What are they prepared to pay 
for this additional flexibility and capacity? Why, nothing, of course. Talk 
about a government entitlement program! Make them bid for the frequencies, 
don't just give them away. 
</P>
<P>
 The common theme here is that the telecommunications industry is now trying to 
paint Big Government and regulation as the obstacles to their progress and to 
innovation. It won't work. The real barrier to innovation is that the 
technology for the right price just isn't here yet. Look at Time Warner's 
delayed experiment with high-tech cable TV in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 By treating government as the enemy, the telecommunications industry thinks it 
can get the people on its side. The industry is wrong. What it will discover is 
that people will welcome even more government intervention, because that's the 
only relief they see from the imperial behavior of the Smiths, Malones and 
their broadcast brethren, who are asking them to pay more at a time when 
competitive pressures are holding everything else down -- including their 
paychecks.

 Miriam Grimm of Danville, Calif., figured she had a sure winner.When Levi 
Strauss & Co. launched a hunt for the oldest pair of existing Levi's, Grimm 
sent in the pair she bought in 1931 and wore throughout the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Too young, vintage-denim historians ruled. The winner was a torn 1920s pair 
submitted by a Texas geology student, who found them at the bottom of a Nevada 
gold mine shaft. When Heath Rackley found them, they were stiff as a board. He 
tossed them in the washing machine, and they survived to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 His prize? A trip to San Francisco, $1,000 and a custom pair of Levi's -- 
without the rips. MARTHA GROVES

NO PLANS TO SHED TROUBLED UNIT, SAYS HEAD OF PRUDENTIAL; SECURITIES: CHAIRMAN 
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PARTNERSHIP DEBACLE HAS HURT THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY.

 Prudential Insurance Chairman Robert C. Winters said Wednesday that the 
company has no plans to divest itself of its Prudential Securities subsidiary, 
despite a relentless wave of unfavorable attention drawn to the brokerage by 
the investigations and lawsuits stemming from its problems involving limited 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting with journalists, Winters sought to focus attention on the parent 
company's strong financial performance in 1993, including a boost of its 
capital by $869 million to $10.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also apologized for "mistakes" made while he has been in charge that 
have harmed thousands of small investors and led to a federal criminal 
investigation of both the insurance company parent and brokerage subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hurt too many of our customers," Winters said. "The public image of 
Prudential has suffered during my watch, and I feel the weight of that burden." 
</P>
<P>
 But in response to a question, he added, "I have received a lot of assurances 
from the board that I continue to have their full confidence." And Prudential's 
directors have "every confidence" in the brokerage, as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick Simmons, chief executive of Prudential Securities, confirmed that the 
partnership debacle is taking a toll on the brokerage, though, like most Wall 
Street firms, it continues to have strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage has set aside reserves of $430 million because of the legal 
problems. And Simmons said its mutual fund business and several other product 
lines grew more slowly than expected in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He also confirmed that there has been an upsurge in the number of brokers 
leaving the firm since the beginning of the year -- about 80, Simmons said, a 
number he attributed to the impact of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Prudential Securities settled federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission charges that it failed to supervise brokers, misled investors who 
bought partnership units and ignored promises it had made in an earlier SEC 
disciplinary settlement. The brokerage agreed to pay at least $371 million in 
fines and restitution to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, several state insurance departments have begun 
investigations of Prudential, in part for its role in the sale of limited 
partnership units. Winters said Wednesday that he expects the New York 
insurance department to fine the company because it illegally sold financial 
products that regulators had ruled could not be marketed in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Winters said he did not know how large a fine to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential has also drawn criticism for hiring Anthony J. Amaradio, a 
high-producing Orange County insurance salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential hired Amaradio in 1991, just after he was fired by the Equitable 
Life Assurance Society, where the National Assn. of Securities Dealers charged 
that he had made deceptive sales pitches to customers and placed false 
advertising. No further charges have been filed, but Amaradio is the subject of 
further investigation by the NASD for his sales practices since joining 
Prudential. 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to a question, Winters said that if the firm had it to do over 
again, it probably would not have hired Amaradio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an example of one where probably today we wouldn't hire this 
individual," Winters said, because the company is now being watched so closely 
by regulators and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaradio has obeyed all rules during his time with Prudential, Winters said, 
adding that the company has no plans to sever its ties to him. Amaradio has 
denied any wrongdoing.

 SEC Chief Faults Inequities in Regulation: Banks that sell mutual funds are 
not subject to the same regulations as securities firms, and that's bad for 
investors and perhaps for the overall economy, Securities and Exchange 
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. told the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee's investigations panel, which is reviewing the planned merger of 
mutual fund Dreyfus Corp. and Mellon Bank Corp. With the merger, Mellon and its 
affiliates would be the largest mutual fund investment adviser, managing $76.8 
billion in mutual fund assets. But Levitt noted that federal law exempts banks 
from the rules that cover brokers and investment advisers, including SEC 
inspections.

 Viacom Completes Tender Offer for Paramount: Although it will still be several 
weeks before the merger of the two companies is completed, Viacom, which owns 
MTV, Nickelodeon and other cable channels, said it accepted for payment nearly 
61.7 million Paramount shares under terms of a $107-a-share cash tender offer 
for 50.1% of its nearly 123 million shares.It said more than 120.3 million 
shares were tendered by the midnight Tuesday deadline for the tender offer. As 
a result, it will determine the pro-ration for accepting the shares tendered by 
March 11, when it intends to pay for the controlling stake. It will exchange 
securities for the remaining 49.9% of Paramount shares at a later date.

A SHAKY BOTTOM LINE; VALLEY FIRMS TABULATE BITE EARTHQUAKE TOOK FROM PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Just as the physical force of the Northridge earthquake hopscotched around the 
San Fernando Valley, picking and choosing the victims of its worst punishment, 
some Valley companies are taking a hit to their bottom lines because of lost 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems cited include damage to facilities and merchandise and lost sales 
in the days after the Jan. 17 quake. Some insurance companies face big payouts 
for claims. Financial institutions could suffer if homeowners walk away from 
their mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics Corp., a Chatsworth maker of computer printers and communications 
products, said Wednesday that it lost $242,000 on sales of $5.6 million in its 
fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31, mainly because of earthquake-related 
setbacks. A year earlier, Datametrics earned $256,000 -- excluding a onetime 
accounting gain -- on revenue of $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was shut down for four days after the quake because it had no 
electricity. Later, shipments of materials used in Datametrics products didn't 
arrive. The delays were particularly damaging because they came at the end of 
the quarter and because the recession has forced companies such as Datametrics 
to time shipments tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the nail in the horse's shoe that makes you lose the war," 
Datametrics Chief Executive Sidney E. Wing said.  
</P>
<P>
 The company also suffered because workers needed time off to deal with 
personal problems, Wing said. And every time an aftershock rattled, "they 
wanted to get out of the building," even though city inspectors have deemed the 
structure safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Fan Co. in Woodland Hills estimated its earthquake damage, 
including merchandise destroyed by the temblor, at between $200,000 and 
$500,000. None of the products were earthquake-insured, and the company is 
still assessing its water damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be an impact on quarterly earnings," Controller Neil MacDonald 
said. Fortunately for Beverly Hills Fan, before the earthquake it had already 
rung up $1.6 million in sales, double that of the first quarter a year earlier. 
The company said that if it posts a profit this quarter, it will be a small 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Art publisher and retailer Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc. in Van Nuys 
said its first-quarter sales will probably be "significantly" lower because of 
the earthquake and the severe cold in the Midwest and East Coast. The firm 
hopes to recover at least some quake-related losses from its insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence said quake damage has kept its galleries closed in the 
Northridge Fashion Center and Sherman Oaks Fashion Square shopping malls. Its 
headquarters was also shut down for two weeks after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter ended March 31, Martin Lawrence lost $1.7 million on $4.7 
million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those companies likely to feel an earnings bite from the earthquake are 
property-casualty insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Industries, the Woodland Hills parent of 20th Century Insurance 
Co. and 21st Century Casualty Co., estimated its quake claims at $160 million. 
After taxes and reinsurance, the total will drop to $62.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of that will be in the first quarter," said Richard Dinon, 
senior vice president at 20th Century, the state's sixth-largest carrier of 
earthquake insurance. In the first quarter of 1993, the company earned $23.9 
million on $263.1 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at Amwest Insurance Group Inc., the earthquake "is going to be 
immaterial" to earnings, said Steven R. Kay, chief financial officer. That's 
because the Woodland Hills company specializes in writing surety bonds 
guaranteeing construction and other projects. In fact, said Kay, Amwest might 
benefit if the earthquake spurs rebuilding. "That's what you need surety bonds 
for. It could be an opportunity for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and savings and loans also stand to feel some pain from the quake. 
American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks, one of the nation's largest Small 
Business Administration lenders, cited the Northridge earthquake as one reason 
it added to its loan-loss reserves for 1993. As a result, its earnings declined 
54% in its fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, to $197,899 from $430,556 a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Financial Corp. said it does not expect a "material loss" from 
the quake. Two buildings at its large Chatsworth complex were badly damaged, 
but rebuilding costs should be covered by the savings and loan company's 
insurance, spokesman Steve L. Hawkins said.  
</P>
<P>
 A bigger problem would occur if large numbers of homeowners who can't afford 
to rebuild their quake-damaged houses walk away from their mortgages, Hawkins 
said. The company is optimistic that that scenario won't come to pass because 
most borrowers who are taking advantage of Great Western's offer to place a 
90-day moratorium on mortgage payments do not have severe structural damage on 
their properties -- and many have earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank estimated that it has $1.5 billion in real estate loans 
in earthquake-affected areas. But Judy Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the 
Glendale-based thrift, said the extent of any losses won't be known for another 
week or two. She said Glendale Federal was calling all its borrowers and 
depositors and inspecting properties. "There are still so many variables." 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies also said it is too soon to tell what impact, if any, the 
earthquake will have on profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven M. Besbeck, president of Creative Computer Applications Inc., a 
provider of information systems for laboratories and pharmacies, said his 
company didn't resume full operations until a few weeks after the quake. Its 
Calabasas offices were drenched when sprinklers went off during the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Besbeck has hired specialists to determine whether the company's electronic 
equipment is salvageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have an effect on the quarter that ends Feb. 28," he said, "but I'm 
not even sure about that yet."

U.S. AUTO MAKERS EXPECT RECORD PROFITS THIS YEAR; SALES: INCREASED PRODUCTION 
SCHEDULES AND REDUCED REBATE EXPENSES SHOULD COMBINE TO SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST BIG 
THREE EARNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With auto sales moving into high gear, Detroit's Big Three car makers are 
planning sharp increases in second-quarter production rates, setting the stage 
for record profits this year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates by industry watcher Ward's Automotive Reports, General 
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. plan to build 2.69 million cars 
and trucks in the United States next quarter, up almost 11% from the 2.43 
million vehicles built a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say the robust production schedules, coupled with a steady 
decline in rebate expenses, should translate into record profits for the 
quarter and the year for the once-beleaguered auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "1994 will set an all-time earnings record for the Big Three," said Dean 
Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst Ronald Glantz. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, GM, Ford and Chrysler posted combined profits of more than $7 
billion. But S.G. Warburg & Co. auto analyst David Healy expects that to almost 
double this year to $13 billion, with the biggest profits coming in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second quarter could be the best of the year," Healy said. "Usually by a 
small margin, the second quarter is the best production period of the year and 
therefore probably the best earnings period of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Detroit's Big Three earned more than $2.3 billion in the second 
quarter, a mark analysts say should easily be surpassed this year as the 
industry continues to reduce the amount of money it spends on rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is so strapped for inventory that it's substantially reducing 
incentives for fleets as well as the consumer," Glantz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the fourth quarter of last year, GM, Ford and Chrysler reduced the 
average retail rebate by $245 to just under $800 per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect the onslaught of new vehicles, like the Dodge Neon, Ford 
Contour and Chevrolet Lumina later this year, to allow auto makers to trim 
those costs even further in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor helping Detroit is the increasing age of the motor fleet and 
the growing popularity of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Glantz, one out of every four cars on the road today is more than 
12 years old and will need to be replaced soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to keep up with demand, U.S. auto makers are increasing output, 
particularly of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ward's, Detroit's Big Three are planning to build 1,342,000 
trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles in the second quarter, up 15.4% 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger car output by GM, Ford and Chrysler is expected to rise a more 
modest 6.3% to 1,344,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 The push toward trucks has surprised even some auto executives, forcing 
companies to try to find ways to squeeze out additional vehicles without 
building new assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for example, GM said it will add a third work crew at its Flint, 
Mich., van plant in May and delay the closing of its Pontiac West factory in 
Michigan for two months to keep up with demand.

U.S. TO SPEND $50 MILLION ON NEW CHIPS; TECHNOLOGY: VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE 
ANNOUNCES THE PROGRAM TO BUILD A CENTER FOR SEMICONDUCTOR STUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that the federal government will spend 
tens of millions of dollars to help U.S. companies "develop the computer chips 
of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore spoke at a ceremony at which it was announced that the Clinton 
Administration will spend $50 million over five years to establish a center for 
the simulation and modeling of semiconductor materials, manufacturing processes 
and chip design. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100-million program will be set up by the Department of Energy and the 
semiconductor industry, which will pick up the other half of the cost, Energy 
Secretary Hazel O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the Administration will also seek 
funding for a $25-million, five-year National Semiconductor Metrology Program 
to help the industry meet its challenges, including developing ever-smaller 
measuring tools. 
</P>
<P>
 With Brown, O'Leary and representatives of the semiconductor industry at his 
side, Gore said the industry is at the heart of the global electronics 
revolution and is important to the United States for both economic and national 
security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computers and information-processing equipment are the engines pulling our 
economic recovery over the last year, accounting for most of the growth -- 
three full percentage points of the growth -- in U.S. industrial production," 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said semiconductors will be the "V-8 engines on the information 
superhighway" the Administration is fostering and will continue to give the 
United States an edge in developing "smart" weapons that minimize casualties 
while destroying targets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said the industry has been investing heavily to meet its challenges, 
plowing more than 25% of sales last year into research, development, new plants 
and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This extraordinary high rate of investment is one reason the United States 
has regained the leadership worldwide of the semiconductor industry that it 
lost to Japan in the 1980s," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said that while the $50 million for the modeling and simulation center 
could come from existing funds in her department's budget, the Administration 
will have to ask Congress to approve most of the $25 million for the Commerce 
Department program. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it has not been decided where the modeling and simulation center will 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said in a statement that the semiconductor industry employs 
2.3 million Americans and is expected to grow to $2 trillion a year by 2000.

47 SENATORS JOIN FOES OF PLAN TO RAISE ETHANOL USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Siding with an uncommon alliance of environmentalists and oil companies 
against Midwestern corn farmers, almost half the U.S. Senate sent a letter 
Wednesday to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency urging it to drop a plan 
to mandate the use of ethanol in cleaner-burning gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), the group of 47 senators said the ethanol 
requirement would boost the cost of gasoline and unfairly favor one additive 
over another. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining in the criticism were Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), chairman of the 
Senate Energy Committee, and the panel's ranking Republican, Sen. Malcolm 
Wallop of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the opposition of its staff scientists, the EPA proposed in December that 
30% of the new gasoline, due in Los Angeles and the rest of the nation's 
smoggiest cities in 1995, include an oxygenating additive made from a renewable 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential election, the Bush Administration first overrode 
an agreement -- reached in 1991 negotiations that included environmentalists, 
regulators, the oil and natural gas companies and the ethanol lobby -- not to 
mandate a specific fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's December proposal went even further, virtually 
assuring ethanol -- primarily made from corn -- a major share of the new 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for ethanol is strong in Corn Belt states. It has been led by the 
politically potent Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., which produces up to 70% of the 
nation's ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
 But both the oil and natural gas industry -- which produces methanol, a rival 
oxygenate -- and many environmentalists have questioned ethanol's high cost of 
production and its volatility, which actually could increase air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many people in the Congress who know that ethanol is not a panacea 
for our energy fuel needs in this country," Richard J. Stegemeier, chairman and 
chief executive of Unocal Corp., said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration touchiness about the issue was obvious Monday, when 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena retracted much of a detailed letter to 
Budget Director Leon Panetta that outlined his objections to the ethanol 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena staffers said the letter, in which Pena wrote that he strongly opposed 
the provision, did not represent his true views and was signed, mistakenly, by 
an automatic signing device, not Pena himself.

 Litton Posts Second-Quarter Loss: Litton Industries reported a $151.3-million 
loss due to spinning off its non-defense businesses.The loss for the three 
months ended Jan. 31, the equivalent of $3.32 per share, came on sales of $804 
million. That was up from $754 million a year earlier on comparable defense 
electronics and shipbuilding operations. Litton recorded $174.7 million in 
special charges for splitting off its energy exploration data and automated 
assembly line businesses into a separate company. Setting aside the charge for 
discontinued operations, Litton's profit rose 27% during the quarter. Litton 
attributed the higher operating earnings to reduced interest expenses, improved 
sales of advanced electronics and a strong performance in Navy shipbuilding.

 Microsoft Reworking Programs to Avoid Patent Claims: Reacting to last week's 
loss of a patent infringement lawsuit, the software company is believed to be 
revamping as many as six programs that make use of its disputed 
data-compression technology.Microsoft executives said the cost of changing the 
products will have no material effect on the company. But one official called 
the effort "a distraction." Last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered Redmond, 
Wash.-based Microsoft to pay Carlsbad-based Stac Electronics Co. $120 million 
for infringing patents that underlie a technique making it possible to cut in 
half the amount of hard disk space required to store information. Microsoft 
said it plans to appeal the verdict.

 GM, UAW Reach Agreement to Avert Strike: The tentative accord between General 
Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers was over a three-year contract for a 
GM plant in Oklahoma City.Linda Smith, a secretary at UAW Local 1999, said 
agreement was reached about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. The union, which represents 
4,500 workers at the plant, had set a 10 a.m. strike deadline. A union 
spokesman said the final bargaining session lasted 30 hours. Details of the 
agreement were not immediately available. The agreement averted what would have 
been the first strike in the 15-year history of the plant, where the Cutlass 
Ciera and the Buick Century are produced. Talks had been under way for eight 
months.

HOME SHOPPING TAKEOVER BATTLE II; TELEVISION: INFOMERCIAL MAKER NATIONAL MEDIA 
TRIES TO UP THE ANTE IN THE PURCHASE OFFER BY VALUEVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the heels of QVC's failed run at Paramount, another home shopping takeover 
battle is escalating as infomercial maker National Media Corp. tries to thwart 
a bid from ValueVision International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The $140-million battle is tiny in scale compared to the $10-billion fight for 
Paramount Communications Inc., which home shopping giant QVC Network Inc. lost 
to cable programmer Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal comes complete with a proxy fight, high-priced Wall Street 
advisers, speculation over a "white knight" third buyer, and the avid 
participation of takeover stock specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is also being watched as a bellwether of the budding infomercial 
industry, which has an image as something of a gaudy souvenir stand but is 
closing in on $1 billion a year in revenues. Infomercials are program-length 
commercials that are used to inform an audience about a product. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be watching with a lot of interest," said spokesman David Savage of the 
National Infomercial Marketing Assn., an industry group. "There's a lot of 
shakeout in the industry right now, and this is just a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Savage said the outcome of the deal could help place a value on other 
infomercial firms. Such firms typically buy time on cable television channels 
and produce commercials selling products such as jewelry, electronics and 
knickknacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercials run during time leased from cable television channels, often 
late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 ValueVision, a Minneapolis-based television home shopping network run by 
veterans of a similar firm sold to QVC in 1989, made a cash and stock tender 
offer last month of $10.50 per share, or about $140 million, for National 
Media. 
</P>
<P>
 ValueVision's network reaches 10 million homes, mainly via cable and satellite 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia-based National Media rejected the bid Feb. 18, as it had an 
earlier, lower offer from ValueVision, as "financially inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 ValueVision then launched a proxy battle to elect a new board at National 
Media's annual meeting March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, National Media said this week that it was willing to be sold, at 
a price. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question, if our investment bankers surface a relationship that 
makes sense at the right price, we would certainly sell the company," Craig 
Streem, National Media investor relations vice president, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Streem said National Media had made contacts with other firms about a possible 
sale. He declined to say whether talks are under way and said there were no 
plans to meet with ValueVision unless it makes a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
 ValueVision Chairman Robert Johander said in a telephone interview Wednesday: 
"They clearly want us to bid against ourselves. We have no interest in bidding 
against ourselves. Their rhetoric isn't going to get us to raise our bid." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said ValueVision might pay more if it learned new and compelling 
information about National Media. 
</P>
<P>
 Johander and other ValueVision officials were in Philadelphia Wednesday to 
meet with National Media shareholders as part of the proxy campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation over possible additional buyers includes King World Productions 
Inc., syndicator of television shows such as "Oprah Winfrey" and "Jeopardy!" 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's somebody else out there (as a buyer), you can make a lot of money 
on this," said one arbitrager, who estimated that 30% to 40% of National 
Media's stock is now in the hands of arbitragers. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of National Media's stock has nearly doubled since ValueVision made 
its first stock purchases in December. National Media stock closed Wednesday at 
$9.875, up 12.5 cents on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 ValueVision now holds 8.6% of National Media's 13.5 million shares, compared 
to about 18% held by National Media officers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unique twist, ValueVision said last week that National Media may have 
swallowed its own poison pill takeover defense -- thus enabling ValueVision or 
other outside shareholders to buy National Media stock at half-price -- through 
stock purchases by officers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 ValueVision will probably seek a Delaware court ruling on whether the pill was 
triggered, Johander said, but he said the issue was not a major obstacle to its 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle has also highlighted the emergence of the Philadelphia area as "the 
Hollywood of home shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 The region serves as headquarters to three of the country's top five 
infomercial firms, Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is led by privately held American Telecast, in suburban Paoli, 
Pa., followed by National Media. Regal Communications Corp., also in the top 
five, is also based in suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, QVC, of West Chester, Pa., the nation's largest cable home 
shopping network, announced last month that it will start its own infomercial 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to explain the proliferation in Philadelphia, Savage was stumped. "I've 
been in this job for over a year, and I don't know the answer to that 
question."

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: CD-ROM TAX PROGRAMS? WASTED BYTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IRS, meet CD-ROM. The two leading tax preparation programs, ChipSoft's 
TurboTax and Meca's TaxCut, are now available on multimedia compact discs for 
those who want moving pictures and sound along with forms and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimedia versions require an IBM-compatible personal computer with 
Windows, a CD-ROM drive and a sound board. There are also non-multimedia 
versions on floppy disks for Windows, Macintosh and MS-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia tax programs may be eye- and ear-catching, but when it comes to 
filling out your tax returns, they're not much more useful than the floppy disk 
versions of the same programs. More on that later, but first let's look at the 
basic tax preparation software you can get on a CD or floppy disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Any version of TurboTax and TaxCut can prepare your federal and, in many 
cases, state returns. The same can be said for Parson Technology's Personal Tax 
Edge and Computer Associate's CA-Simply Tax. In each case, you have the option 
of entering information directly on an on-screen replica of an IRS form, or 
submitting to an "interview" and letting the program put the data on the forms 
for you.  
</P>
<P>
 TaxCut does the best job at shielding you from IRS forms. The program 
pioneered the use of the interview format and this year has added another help 
system called the Navigator, which uses graphics to help guide you through the 
return. The interview takes place on the top half of the screen, while tax and 
program advice appear on the bottom. You can optionally view the tax forms on 
the bottom of the screen as you enter data on top.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TurboTax also has an interview system, called EasyStep, but it's not quite as 
easy to use as TaxCut's. The program is very good for people who are 
comfortable with filling out IRS forms. Yet there is still plenty of 
context-sensitive on-line help, including official IRS instructions that are 
keyed to whatever form and line you're working on. 
</P>
<P>
 Both programs provide access to all the forms most people need, and they 
greatly reduce data entry by automatically copying information from one form to 
another. They also do your arithmetic and calculate the amount due or 
refundable. Each of them prints IRS-approved forms and makes it possible to 
send them in electronically through an IRS-approved service bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs are clearly better than filling out your forms by hand. At a 
street price of less than $40 (add $10 to $15 for the CD-ROM versions), they're 
probably more cost-effective than going to one of the mass-market tax 
preparation services staffed by people with limited training. 
</P>
<P>
 However, computer programs don't protect you from entering incorrect 
information, and they are limited in terms of how much advice they can give you 
when it comes to lowering your tax obligation. Anyone with a complicated tax 
scenario may be better off with a CPA, tax attorney or other tax professional. 
</P>
<P>
 By delivering special versions on CD-ROM, Meca and ChipSoft have been able to 
add instructional material that, in theory, should make the programs easier to 
use. I'm not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 ChipSoft took a cafeteria approach with its multimedia version. In addition to 
the basic Windows version of TurboTax, there are several extra programs, 
including a video guide featuring Fortune magazine Managing Editor Marshall 
Loeb, an on-disc version of J.K. Lasser's best-selling tax guide, an 
interactive tax savings guide and IRS on-line instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 The TurboTax CD also comes with the state tax preparation software for 
California and New York. Residents of other states can use the enclosed coupon 
to order their state software by mail, at no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Watching mini-movies of Loeb talking about taxes isn't my idea of 
entertainment, and it's not an efficient way to learn about tax savings. He 
does give some excellent advice, but his comments would be just as easy to 
understand in written form. Besides, the film clips are very basic and general. 
You can get far more information on TV and radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasser's "Your Income Tax," which does not include any sound or video, 
contains useful advice, but ChipSoft chose a poor way to deliver it. To read 
the guide (which is a graphic image of the printed book) you need to install 
the Adobe Acrobat Reader. The software, which comes on the CD, is copied to 
your hard disk. You must also copy another piece of software, Adobe Type 
Manager, which not only takes more disk space but, once installed, runs 
automatically every time you start Windows, whether you need it or not, hogging 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't mind this if the CD came with an un-install program to get rid of 
these files. But it doesn't. I'm not sure which is harder, removing a Windows 
program from the various places it has inscribed itself on your system or 
filling out IRS tax forms by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 TaxCut, by the way, does come with an un-install option. After you're done 
with your taxes, the program automatically removes itself from your hard disk, 
although it does not delete your data files.  
</P>
<P>
 Meca took a different approach. With Multimedia TaxCut, the instructional 
material is integrated into the program so that audio and video help pops up as 
your prepare your return. But the use of sound and video doesn't really make it 
any easier to complete your tax returns. There are two multimedia features. One 
simply reads aloud instructions that are already on screen in the non-CD 
version. I found it annoying and a lot more time consuming than just reading 
the instructions on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The other multimedia tool presents a series of clips of the program's author, 
tax attorney Dan Caine, explaining various aspects of the software and tax law. 
Caine's mini-lectures do include some useful information, but again, it's the 
type of information that could easily be displayed in text form. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm all for using sound and video as a teaching tool. A video clip is a great 
way to show how a heart valve works or illustrate the trajectory of a 
spacecraft. Sound clips are wonderful ways to teach music or provide a clip 
from a historically significant speech. But talking heads on a tax preparation 
program are a waste of bytes.

AUTHORITIES RAID 2 FUTURES TRADING FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Department of Corporations and the federal Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission on Wednesday jointly raided two businesses alleged to be 
selling gold, silver and currency futures without proper registration. 
</P>
<P>
 The targets, Lida International Financial Data in San Gabriel and Worth 
Financial Data in San Francisco, were barred from doing business under a state 
administrative action, pending a federal court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies allege that Lida and Worth, both owned by Topworth International 
of Hong Kong, sold futures primarily to Asian residents of California but 
failed to register their brokers with the CFTC. Officials also alleged that the 
futures, if they existed, were not traded on regulated exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it's possible that the trades never took place," a spokeswoman for 
the corporations department said. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as $30 million may have been collected from 5,000 investors by the 
companies since 1991, the state agency said. It will make a formal announcement 
of the raids today. Executives at the companies could not be reached. TOM

TEENS SUGGEST WAYS TO HELP CURB GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The teen-ager's voice was scratchy and distant over the public address system, 
but his frustration was clear as he described to county officials the lack of 
opportunity that drives his peers to pick up spray paint cans and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just no jobs for us," said Juan of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was one of the first callers Wednesday to Youth Rap, a one-day hot 
line to survey students about their solutions for curbing the county's graffiti 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez and county schools Supt. John F. Dean fielded 
calls and jotted down the ideas that students countywide had devised during two 
weeks of class exercises. The officials also talked with 25 students gathered 
in a Department of Education boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestions varied little. The students talked of tougher penalties, 
dedicating certain community walls for taggers to paint legally and enforcing 
curfews. The most common request was for more activities or jobs to keep kids 
off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they do this because they don't have other things to do," Juan said, 
adding that he has been looking for a job with no luck. "I think Orange County 
is beautiful, the beaches and the weather and the malls. But it's going to end 
up just like L.A. with all the homeless and gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Other callers suggested after-school art programs to provide taggers with 
legal canvases for their handiwork, or clubs that focus on music. 
</P>
<P>
 "For these people, it's a way to express themselves," a girl from Irvine told 
the officials. "If they have (a club), it might give them a different way to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said he was somewhat surprised to hear the students cite a lack of 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business over and over about needing something to do, that made an 
impression on me," Dean said afterward. "Not all kids are sports-minded. It'd 
be great if we could extend the activities somehow, with this music group for 
example. But the budget -- well, it just kills us. Everything relies on money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said he also was glad to hear the students, both the callers and some 
members of the audience, support the idea of enforcing curfews. "I think if we 
could nail some of these (taggers) on curfew, it might go a long way toward 
changing the minds of the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth, 13, of Sycamore Junior High School in Anaheim, stood up and told 
Dean and Vasquez that a curfew would not deter youngsters who are already fixed 
on rebelling. "It's not going to work because they're just going to run away 
from home." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Sycamore student in the crowd, Maria, 14, said many of the suggestions 
miss the point. To stop tagging, she said, parents must be able to control 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents should get to know their kids, because you guys don't even know what 
your kids are doing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he was happy to hear the students put forward the idea of tougher 
penalties, a linchpin concept of his Graffiti Task Force formed last summer. 
The task force has advocated a change in the state law, lowering the felony 
vandalism level from $5,000 worth of damage to $400. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to hear that," a chuckling Vasquez told a young caller who 
suggested the level go lower still, to $250. "We'd be doing big business then." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said the similarity of the student suggestions to the task force's 
agenda is encouraging. "It means we're on the right track, so it's very good to 
hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions to the Youth Rap hot line, both the two dozen calls handled by the 
two county officials and another 40 handled by a bank of operators, will be 
compiled and returned to the county's school districts within 40 days. For 
information of the program or to find out about upcoming Youth Rap sessions,

JURY AWARDS $175,000 IN 'CHEWING ACCIDENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A jury awarded $175,000 on Wednesday to an unemployed truck driver who said 
his jaw was dislocated when he crunched on a bone while eating a "boneless" 
chicken sandwich at McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck driver, Claude Allan Hart, was relieved by the verdict, but said, 
"There's no amount of money you can put on what I've been through. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 4 1/2 years of pain can't be compensated with money," said Hart, who said 
he can open his mouth no wider than an inch and chews food with his front 
teeth. "It's been hell." 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury took four hours to decide that the 
chicken patty maker, Cargill Poultry of Buena Vista, Ga., was negligent in 
making the breaded patty with a one-inch bone inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Michael E. Wenzel said Cargill officials were disappointed 
with the decision and are considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors found that the two other defendants named in Hart's civil lawsuit -- 
the McDonald's franchise owner and the trucking company that delivered the 
patty -- were not liable for the "chewing accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, 42, of Stanton, said he ordered his usual lunch of french fries, a 
chocolate milkshake and a $1.99 McChicken sandwich at a McDonald's in Orange in 
September, 1989. Three bites into the sandwich, Hart testified, he felt an 
"explosion" on the right side of his head. He said he pulled out a bone lodged 
vertically in his mouth and gave it to the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, his jaw became swollen and made "clicking and popping" sounds 
whenever he opened his mouth, Hart said. Doctors diagnosed him with a jaw 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's attorney, Johnna J. Hansen, said her client has $9,500 in unpaid doctor 
bills, and will require $30,000 in oral surgery to repair his jaw. She said she 
was pleased with the award, saying the $175,000 is "an adequate amount to 
compensate Mr. Hart."  
</P>
<P>
 The defense, however, contended that Hart suffered from a pre-existing jaw 
problem, and that biting on the bone did not cause the damage Hart claimed. 
Wenzel told jurors that Hart had seen a dentist only twice in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the mishap, Hart said, he sang in a rock 'n' roll band and had a hearty 
appetite. Since then, he said he has slurred speech and can only eat soft foods 
such as oatmeal, cereal and peanut butter on bread.  
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said that the jury's verdict "sends a message to the defendants that 
they should have simply paid Mr. Hart long ago." Before trial, she said, the 
defense's highest offer was $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy about it and glad its finally over," Hart said. "Its been a 
long, long battle."

GRAND JURY BEGINS PROBE IN DEPUTY'S FATAL SHOOTING; HEARING: IT'S UNCLEAR IF 
BRIAN SCANLAN, THE TRAINING OFFICER WHO SHOT DARRYN ROBINS, WILL TESTIFY. A 
TIGHT LID IS KEPT ON PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury began hearing testimony Wednesday on the 
politically volatile Christmas Day shooting death of a sheriff's deputy, as 
local prosecutors turned the case over to the panel to decide on possible 
criminal charges against a training officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities kept a tight rein on the secret proceedings, refusing to say who 
was scheduled to appear or what issues would be addressed during the grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hearings are in progress. Period," said Assistant Dist. Atty. John 
Conley, who is overseeing the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing was clear: Brian Scanlan, the training officer who authorities 
say fatally shot 30-year-old Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins during an impromptu 
training session behind a Lake Forest movie theater, was nowhere to be seen at 
the grand jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear when or whether he may testify. Scanlan's attorney, James 
Stotler of Santa Ana, would not comment on the issue Wednesday, an aide said, 
and Scanlan himself has declined to talk about the case. He is on leave from 
his job pending the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Robins may have been playing the part of a driver pulled over 
in a "hot car" stop when Scanlan, 32, shot him accidentally. While sheriff's 
officials say an informal and unscheduled training session is not unusual, they 
have acknowledged that the use of a loaded weapon during the session did appear 
to violate several department training policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury, made up of 19 members, is expected to hear sworn testimony on 
training procedures and forensics issues, along with details of the shooting 
from investigators on the scene. Sheriff Brad Gates, who has been criticized by 
some civic groups for his department's handling of the case, is not expected to 
testify, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said the grand jury will subpoena most of the witnesses from whom it 
wants to hear testimony. "That's routine. . . . You can't take the risk that 
someone might change their mind about appearing. It's kind of like a party -- 
people say they'll be there, and then they don't show, even the most friendly 
witnesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The panel will continue its work today, with Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King 
assigned to question witnesses before the group. Twelve grand jurors would 
ultimately have to vote to indict Scanlan if he were to be prosecuted in 
Robins' death. 
</P>
<P>
 While Conley said that it is "tough to predict" how long the grand jury probe 
may last, he said he expected a decision on the filing of charges by the end of 
this month. "I can't conceive of it taking any longer than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities originally predicted at the time of the shooting that they would 
make a decision on whether to file charges against Scanlan by the end of 
January.  
</P>
<P>
 The delay has only fueled attacks from minority groups about the handling of 
the investigation, but many of these critics said they welcomed the district 
attorney's decision two weeks ago to turn the case over to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The tactical move followed repeated calls from minority groups for an 
independent investigation into the shooting, and it appeared to offer 
prosecutors the chance to distance themselves from the ultimate decision on 
Scanlan's criminal liability in the case.

DEMAND OVERPOWERS PEPPER SPRAY SUPPLIES; ONE SELF-DEFENSE PROGRAM OVERWHELMED 
BY RESPONSE; TWO NEW SITES TO OPEN SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gene Covell doesn't believe in using guns for self-protection, but he has no 
problem with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-year-old salesman took a break from his job Wednesday afternoon to 
complete a two-hour training session where he was taught how to properly use 
the tear gas, which became legal under California law Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had considered carrying it illegally, just to have something effective to 
protect myself," Covell said. "I'm in and out of parking lots a lot, so I feel 
exposed. I want something for self-defense, but I don't like guns. They kill 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Covell was among the dozens of people who have been crowding into the offices 
of Martial Arts Security Service Inc. in Santa Ana for the last two days for a 
course in pepper spray tear-gas training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in business since 1978 and I've never seen anything with this kind 
of impact," said William S. Ungerman, the school's president. "We've taken over 
500 calls. I'm sure it will level off, but there has been a tremendous 
response. We never expected this." 
</P>
<P>
 When properly used, the stinging pepper spray, known as oleoresin capsicum 
tear gas, disables a person by forcing his eyes shut and restricting his 
breathing. The searing pain and difficulty in breathing are initially acute, 
subside within 10 to 15 minutes and are usually gone within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Assailants can be disabled from a distance of as much as 10 feet, Ungerman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, Ungerman's school was the only site in Orange County to 
receive state certification and the materials needed to teach the use of pepper 
spray. Two others, California Security and the Gendarme Institute, both in 
Garden Grove, have received their state licenses and will also be offering the 
training soon, officials at the two companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The training course, which can cost between $30 and $45, includes watching a 
30-minute videotape, passing a 30-question test, and test-spraying a canister 
filled with a harmless substance such as water. 
</P>
<P>
 The local schools are among the more than 200 sites statewide that have been 
licensed by the state Department of Justice to sell the spray. The substance 
was legalized by the Legislature on the condition that users be trained to 
properly use it before being allowed to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 The spray itself, which is sold in three-ounce canisters for between $14 and 
$20, will be available at about 14 other locations locally, including law 
enforcement uniform stores and community colleges where training courses will 
be offered, said Clay Segar of Defense Technology Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be pretty easy for someone to pick up once they have their permit," 
said Segar, whose company has been authorized by the state to sell pepper 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Vilensky, regional manager of Uniforms Inc. in Santa Ana, said his company 
is also selling the tear gas and has received a flood of inquiries this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling people to go over and get the training," Vilensky said. "We also 
caution them that if they give the pepper spray to someone else, like their 
wife or girlfriend, and that person is not authorized to carry it, it's 
breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a misdemeanor to carry pepper spray tear gas without legal certification 
and a felony to use the spray in the commission of a crime, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine resident Teddy Jones, 56, said she had been trying in vain for months 
to buy pepper spray by calling police departments and veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a lot of walking in the woods, and I want it to protect myself against 
dogs, animals and people," said Jones, a retired schoolteacher. "I want it for 
peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 As Jones prepared to watch the 30-minute video at Martial Arts Security 
Service Inc., she said she was annoyed at the trouble she had to go through to 
get the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea that people have means of legal protection, but I 
think it's foolish to make people go through all of this," said Jones. "You 
don't have to go through a test when you buy a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Woods, a 41-year-old general contractor from Aliso Viejo, said 
legalization of pepper spray is long overdue, especially since it is already 
available in 47 other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather use (pepper spray) since it's non-lethal," Woods said. "It's a 
good thing for people to have. When someone who is trying to attack you can't 
see or breathe, they go down." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law was authored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), who 
said she carried the legislation to give people who want to protect themselves 
an alternative to buying guns.

CRASH VICTIM'S COMA ENDS, BUT NOT TROUBLES; MEDICINE: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MUST 
LEAVE HOSPITAL, HAS NOWHERE TO GO. MEDI-CAL, INS SAY HE'S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR 
REHABILITATION HE MUST HAVE.

 The broken figure sitting in a wheelchair at Tustin Hospital Medical Center on 
Wednesday barely grasped the meaning of "good morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Sanchez Morales, a 24-year-old illegal immigrant, has drifted out of a 
four-month coma with a hazy recollection of the past and an even foggier vision 
of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 He nearly died in a car crash. But now, the time has come: He must leave the 
hospital. How -- and where -- he will somehow get the therapy and 
rehabilitation to rebuild his body and mind has become the great and terrible 
question of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll die if he's released from the hospital," said Sanchez's cousin, 
Asuncion Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 For Roberto Sanchez, once strong and self-assured, this has been a terrible 
way to lose his dream and his dignity. In many respects, his story is like that 
of other seemingly faceless migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nation where 37 million Americans lack health insurance, illegal 
immigrants are said to consume at least $2 billion in health care costs 
annually. In California alone, state health officials say, more than $880 
million will be spent on health care for immigrants this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a broader issue: access to health care. Whether this man 
is here legally or illegally, he has, like everyone else in this country, the 
right to full and complete health care," said John Palacio, an official for the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez never wanted it this way. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, he was a vital young man eking out a living by growing corn in a 
tiny village about 60 miles outside Acapulco. But the soil dried and became 
infertile. The region, saturated with jobless men, offered no help. 
</P>
<P>
 Penniless, married, with two infants and another on the way, Sanchez, like 
hundreds of thousands of his compatriots, sought to solve his woes by coming to 
this country illegally to work. He left his family behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In June he settled in San Juan Capistrano, where his brother, Socorro Sanchez, 
and cousin Asuncion live. Sanchez worked in menial jobs here and there, 
sometimes as a baker, making enough money to send some back home. But the 
luckless man saw his hopes for a better future for his wife and children 
shattered in a devastating car crash in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Followed by Border Patrol agents who wanted to question them about their 
resident status, Sanchez and four other Latinos tried to lose the agents by 
speeding away. Sanchez was a passenger in the car. They smashed into another 
vehicle and their car rolled down a ravine into a Lake Forest back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 While his four partners and the driver of the other car sustained broken bones 
and other somewhat significant injuries, only Sanchez was gravely hurt. He was 
taken with head trauma and broken legs to a county hospital, where he underwent 
brain surgery paid for by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 After the surgery, he lapsed into a coma and was transferred to Tustin 
Hospital Medical Center. After four months unconscious, he emerged from his 
deep sleep in early January. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials are in a dilemma. Having seen the young man through a 
life-threatening period, they must now release him. It is not only a question 
of dollars, says Kathleen Santoro, manager of the hospital's Case Management 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not allowed to keep him here," she said. Under its state license, the 
hospital can treat patients in a vegetative state or suffering acute trauma 
from brain injuries, broken necks, drug overdoses or near-fatal gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, she said, "is so much better than any of the (acute trauma) cases we 
are taking care of right now." 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, the hospital, which is outfitted to deal with coma patients but 
not with their rehabilitation, can't handle the next stage of his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Medi-Cal, which has paid the hospital more than $100,000 for Sanchez's care 
during his comatose period and is willing to pay for his stay in a nursing 
home, will not pay for rehabilitation or for the period he has been at the 
hospital since he recovered consciousness two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Medi-Cal's complex rules, he does not qualify, according to Santoro. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be help out there for him, Santoro said, if he had the money to 
pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities say he doesn't 
qualify for rehabilitation funding under its RUCOL (residing under color of 
law) program that allows people in the country legally to receive special 
medical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the INS Western Region, said that in a 
situation such as Sanchez's, "there doesn't appear to be any relief. . . . I 
just don't know that there are any provisions in our law that would entitle him 
to long-term health care if he is illegally in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart goes out to this man and his family," Kice said. "He had an 
unfortunate set of circumstances, but what about the taxpayers? Should they be 
responsible for the costs of this man's long-term (rehabilitation? Some U.S.) 
citizens need the same therapy and are not getting it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who can barely speak, appears not to understand his situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members who live in Orange County and who are indigent feel powerless. 
Having stayed away from the hospital for fear it would force them to take 
Sanchez with them, they finally went to see him this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient's brother, Socorro, could not fight back the tears as he explained 
that he and the other five brothers in the clan, all of them back home in the 
state of Guerrero, Sanchez's native state, are helping Sanchez's family survive 
by "each cooperating a little, enough for (mother and children) to have 
something to eat each day." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members say they understand the arguments against rehabilitative 
treatment for Sanchez, but they hope people will see beyond the politics of the 
situation and help their relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be sent to Arturo Montez, president, LULAC, P.O. Box 1810, Santa 
Ana, Calif. 92702, or people may call (714) 527-9007.

CITY CRACKS DOWN ON 5 MOTELS IN VAN NUYS; CRIME: CONDITIONS AIMED AT CURBING 
PROSTITUTION ARE IMPOSED. SOME FEAR THAT COSTS COULD FORCE SOME OWNERS OUT OF 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sweeping message to businesses on a crime-plagued strip of Sepulveda 
Boulevard, a city zoning administrator Wednesday ordered five Van Nuys motels 
to hire their own security officers and work more closely with police -- or 
risk being shut down as magnets for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials called the move the first of its kind to eliminate a 
neighborhood crime problem by cracking down on more than one business. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate City Zoning Administrator Daniel Green imposed at least 27 
conditions on each motel. He also asked Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin 
Braude, who initiated the investigation that led to the action, to seek 
additional police, encourage tougher anti-prostitution laws and add traffic 
signs that discourage prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Some police and residents touted the conditions as a victory for Braude and 
neighbors who complained about the motels. But others said they are concerned 
that the cost of the conditions could force some motels out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Braude took a good leadership action," said Don Schultz, president of 
the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. "He's the first one who's taken it this far and 
I'm proud that he did." 
</P>
<P>
 "These conditions are going to help us with prostitution, no doubt about 
that," said Capt. James McMurray, commander of the Police Department's Van Nuys 
Station. "I just hope the motels can find a way to pay for it without going out 
of business." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one motel manager felt the same way about the conditions, which also 
include a $4,052 bill to reimburse the city for the cost of the investigation, 
called a revocation process. This process can lead to the motels' closure if 
conditions are not met. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfair," said Gene Ho, manager of the El Cortez Motel in the 5700 block 
of Sepulveda Boulevard. "Right now, the economy is bad. Business is bad. . . . 
We'll take this to court. (Prostitution is) not just the motels' problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a responsibility for the motel owner. There is a responsibility for 
the city," Green countered. "Our desire in the planning department is not to 
shut the business down, but with these conditions, the nuisance should abate." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision marked the first time the city has imposed zoning conditions on 
more than one business in the same area at the same time to alleviate a crime 
problem, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his decision, Green recommended that Braude's office seek legislation that 
prevents prostitutes from getting out of jail the same day they are arrested, 
as well as support increased police presence on Sepulveda Boulevard, roughly 
from Burbank Boulevard to Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Green also asked Braude to seek "no stopping" signs on east-west streets 
adjacent to Sepulveda to prevent prostitutes from being picked up in cars. He 
also suggested that Braude contact the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
and ask the agency to remove bus benches where prostitutes can loiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these things are reasonable and within the scope of probability and 
possibility," said Cindy Miscikowski, Braude's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude initially asked in December for an investigation of criminal activity 
at all 11 Sepulveda Boulevard motels in his district. Following an initial 
inquiry, city zoning officials decided to conduct a public hearing in January 
that dealt with only five motels. 
</P>
<P>
 The motels include The Cinema, Chateau, Bali Hi, Town House and El Cortez 
motels. 
</P>
<P>
 Green's decision requires the motels to hire eight-hour daily security guards 
and a 24-hour on-call security service. Other conditions include providing 
adequate lighting, erecting signs forbidding prostitution and limiting access 
to and from Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Green also ordered the Chateau to install a surveillance camera. But Jaimey 
Lo, the Chateau's manager, said the motel will close this week because of 
recent fire damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the motels will be required to join a neighborhood or business 
watch, employ managers fluent in English and meet monthly with vice officers to 
help them identify suspected or habitual criminals seeking to rent rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Motel owners were unavailable for comment. But managers at the Town House and 
the El Cortez said they will seek legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The motels have until March 17 to file an appeal to Green's order. If no 
appeal is filed, the owners will face a review hearing within the next six 
months, Green said. If the conditions are not met or have not worked by that 
time, the city can close the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Green's decision comes after neighbors and police testified at a public 
hearing last month about crime and other problems at the motels, which included 
complaints about drug dealing and prostitution. In his decision, Green called 
all the motels "a public nuisance" because of the volume of criminal activities 
at and around each location.  
</P>
<P>
 Police responded most to the Town House, where there were 87 arrests between 
1992 and 1993. The Bali Hi had 64 arrests between 1992 and 1993 and the Chateau 
had 45 arrests in 1993 alone. Forty crimes were reported at The Cinema between 
1991 and 1993. By comparison, only 19 crimes were reported at the El Cortez 
during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schultz said the prostitution problem has gone on far too long. Added 
security for the motels is "simply a cost of doing business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Romana Catton, a member of the Chisholm Estates Neighborhood Watch, 
wondered if the conditions were too strict, but was not disappointed that the 
city took action. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her group has been working with the Bali Hi and the Town House to 
eliminate the crime problem. "Right now, both motels are clean," Catton said. 
"And I can't say that about the other ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Bali Hi and Town House have paid security, according to Catton and a 
Town House spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray said that although prostitutes sometimes live in the motels, there 
are many others, including current Northridge earthquake victims, that rely on 
them for cheap lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we put these motels out of business by virtue of these conditions," 
McMurray said, "we've done a disservice to the community."

CALLING STUDENTS BACK; CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED TO BOOST LOW ADULT ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Worried that a drastic drop in enrollment at community adult schools after the 
Northridge earthquake could threaten future attendance-based funding, school 
district officials are launching an all-out campaign to draw students back to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Already struggling to boost enrollment that stagnated with the economy in the 
last few years, Los Angeles Unified School District adult schools suffered an 
additional blow when the quake hit, displacing students or leaving them simply 
too rattled to return to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am concerned for the long term," said James Figueroa, who oversees the 
district's adult schools, which teach English as a second language, citizenship 
and other subjects in day and evening classes to about 400,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is going through great changes, starting with the civil unrest and 
followed by the floods and fires and now the earthquake. People are becoming 
more reluctant to go out in the evenings." 
</P>
<P>
 More than six weeks after the temblor, many San Fernando Valley campuses have 
20% to 30% fewer students than they had at this time last year. At the hardest 
hit campuses, including El Camino and Kennedy, enrollment still hovers at 40% 
of the pre-quake attendance in some classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the missing are recent immigrants, who make up the majority of English 
as a second language classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their jobs are gone, they lost furniture, possessions, living accommodations. 
These things are taking their full-time attention," said Martin Conroy, 
principal of Reseda Community Adult School. "When you have these kinds of 
problems, school's going to have to go. Once it goes, your pattern shifts and 
it's hard to get back into a schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 One group may not return under any circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
 According to teachers and administrators at many Valley adult schools, 
countless numbers of students packed their belongings and fled to their native 
countries or other states after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Blake, an ESL teacher at the Reseda Community Adult School, said two 
women in her class headed for Mexico after the temblor. "When you are really 
scared, you need to be with people you can really talk to," she said. "You 
don't want to be a stranger among strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Others like Jose Flores, a student at Reseda Community Adult School, are 
having trouble getting back on schedule. Flores, 24, lost his apartment in the 
earthquake and slept in his car for more than two weeks while he applied for 
assistance. During that time, his English class was not the first thing on his 
mind. He returned to school two weeks ago, but his attendance is still 
sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be hard to come back to normal," said Flores, who works as a nurses' 
aide at a Tarzana rehabilitation center. "I'm planning to go back to school, 
but I lost everything I had. I have to replace everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators are launching new efforts such as a districtwide televised 
learning program this month that will allow students to watch lessons on 
television and report to school only periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage former students to return and potential ones to enroll, the 
district is spending $30,000 in advertisements on buses and local foreign 
language radio stations with messages like: "Our doors are still open" and "We 
are up and running." District officials are also urging principals and teachers 
to campaign for students in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Portnoy, assistant principal at Kennedy San Fernando Adult School, 
printed thousands of fliers for distribution at elementary schools, libraries 
and retail shops to encourage students to return. 
</P>
<P>
 While a section of the California Education Code will likely protect the adult 
schools from the immediate financial loss that would normally be inflicted with 
decreased enrollment, administrators worry that the earthquake -- coupled with 
the sluggish economy and the increased reluctance of students to leave home at 
night -- will have a long-term negative effect on enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district has an enrollment cap beyond which it will not receive 
state funding, officials are scrambling to attract as many new students as they 
can because projections put this year's attendance rates well below the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Reyes, director of the district's adult schools, said reaching those who 
are still out of class will be a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer a student stays out, the less likely he is to return," Reyes said. 
"Our students come to us on a voluntary basis. Any time there is any change in 
the normal routine, that affects us. It seems like one thing after another in 
the past few years."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; JAIL VISITATION HOURS DOUBLED TO 4 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department has doubled the number of days per week 
the public can visit prisoners in Orange County Jail -- a decision that almost 
restores the visitation time lost because of budget constraints several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and a civil rights attorney involved in the issue said 
Tuesday that visiting privileges have been increased from two days to four days 
after considerable negotiation and the threat of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us from March, 1992, to March, 1994, to get those days back," said 
Dick Herman, a private attorney whose work for the American Civil Liberties 
Union has helped improve jail conditions. "It was a hard-won fight out of the 
limelight, but it is very important for the prisoners, many of whom are in jail 
on minor charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sheriff's new policy, the public can visit prisoners at the men's 
and women's facilities Thursday through Sunday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Jail used to have five days of visitation per week before 
Sheriff Brad Gates, faced with a tight budget, decided to scale them back in 
early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction subsequently became part of a pending federal civil rights 
lawsuit involving living conditions in the County Jail system. In that case, 
however, U.S. District Judge Gary Taylor ruled that two days' visitation did 
not violate the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Taylor's decision, Herman threatened to file another lawsuit in state 
court, alleging that the reduction violated a state law requiring visits within 
24 hours of someone's arrest and a court ruling overturning a no-visitation 
policy for Los Angeles City Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy County Counsel James L. Turner, the county's attorney in the visitation 
dispute, said the sheriff has been trying to restore visitation days for the 
last two years although he is not required to under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the dispute, Turner threatened to seek court sanctions against 
Herman if he filed another lawsuit. A new case would be "frivolous," he said, 
because there is no state law to support the allegations and Judge Taylor has 
already ruled that two days' visitation is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff has always had a policy of allowing as much visitation for 
inmates as his budget and staffing would allow," Turner said. "Unfortunately, 
due to a fiscal crisis, hours of visitation were required to be reduced." DAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COMMUNITY GIVES BACK TO VOLUNTEER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Mary E. Selz saw homeless parents and their children in Orange 
County, she was compelled to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 So she, with the help of others, founded Thomas House Temporary Shelter in 
Garden Grove for families living in their cars or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 For that and for a variety of other contributions to her community, Selz, 57, 
of Fountain Valley was recently recognized as Fountain Valley Chamber of 
Commerce's 1993 Citizen of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother of four and grandmother of five, Selz has been a Brownie troop leader 
and has raised money for such organizations as the American Cancer Society and 
United Cerebral Palsy. She also has taught Catholic education classes and 
helped coordinate volunteers who visited senior citizens in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a warm heart for people in need, and it has been manifested not just 
with the shelter, but in everything she's been involved in," said Mayor John 
Collins, one of the judges and a past recipient of the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go back through all the names of citizens of the year, (many are) 
high-visibility people," he said. "Not many people are going to recognize the 
name Mary Selz, but it's people like her who make the major accomplishments in 
our community and who have that volunteer spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Selz said it is a "wonderful feeling" to receive the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I have done a lot of things in my life, but it's a drop in the bucket 
when I compare it to what God has given to me: my family and good friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Selz refuses to take all the credit for founding the shelter. Her husband of 
34 years, Bernie, was also instrumental. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the heart of Thomas House," said Sister Kathy Stein, the shelter's 
program director. "Without them, it wouldn't have started or continued. They're 
inspirational people." 
</P>
<P>
 Selz said about a dozen friends pitched in with support and seed money to 
start the shelter, named after St. Thomas Villanova, who helped the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter opened in 1987 in a low-income neighborhood lined with stark 
concrete apartment buildings with sparse landscaping. The shelter started with 
one three-bedroom apartment, and the first family was a single mother with a 
young daughter and infant son. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Thomas House consists of four apartments in the same building, two 
apartments in a nearby complex and one apartment in Santa Ana. Financed through 
donations and grant money, the shelter currently serves nine families with a 
total of 18 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein said residents stay three months, look for jobs and child care or attend 
job training programs, and they must attend classes in life skills such as 
parenting, budgeting and savingmoney. 
</P>
<P>
 Selz said Thomas House is its own reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to know that they didn't slip back, that they're working and 
making it."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; TEACHERS GET GRANTS FOR CLASSROOM USE

<P>
 The Irvine Education Foundation has distributed $24,000 in grants to teachers 
that will bring equipment, supplies and materials to classrooms throughout the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 24 "mini-grants" were handed out by the nonprofit group last month. 
They will fund everything from special microscope equipment for a science class 
to videotapes for a library. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants represented only a fraction of the more than 60 funding requests 
received by the foundation from Irvine Unified School District teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mini-grant program was established in 1987 as a way of providing teachers 
with classroom items that the increasingly cash-strapped district simply could 
not provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, just a few hundred dollars can really help the students so much," 
said Elizabeth Thomas of the foundation. "The teachers have to use a lot of 
creativity and inventiveness to teach their classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Fund raising for the grant program reached a record high this year because of 
matching donations made by several Irvine companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants will fund: 
</P>
<P>
 * A hands-on science exhibit at Irvine High School designed to increase 
students' interest in the subject. The exhibit is located in a busy hallway on 
campus. The subject of the exhibit will change each month. 
</P>
<P>
 * A drama writing and production project for Los Naranjos Elementary School 
and Irvine High School students. Elementary school students will write dramas 
that will be performed by high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Audio-visual equipment that can project images from a microscope onto a 
large movie screen. The projector will be used in a science class at Woodbridge 
High where there are not enough microscopes for all students. 
</P>
<P>
 * CD-ROM and laser videodisc software in such subjects as history, literature 
and social sciences for Turtle Rock Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 * The purchase of videotapes for the library at Sierra Vista Middle School. 
The tapes will deal with such issues as personality development, parenting, 
self-esteem and substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has already begun fund-raising activities for next year's 
mini-grants. The goal is to raise $45,000 to $50,000.SHELBY GRAD

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE'S ANIMAL SCIENCE STUDIES CHANGE FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a stressful week editing videotape at a Burbank television studio, 
Elissa Lenard slips into her alter ego: a wool-spinning shepherd at the Pierce 
College farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Substituting a grungy T-shirt and jeans for her professional garb, Lenard, 45, 
is happy for the change of pace. She hopes to someday make raising sheep for 
wool her full-time profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still need my current income to live and to be able to buy hay," Lenard 
said, fingering the oily fleece of a ewe. "But I'd quit my job right now if I 
could. This is what I really enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenard is one of a new breed of students at Pierce who are helping change a 
shrinking animal science curriculum from a largely meat-producing study to one 
that emphasizes animal care and the production of wool, milk and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five years, the school's agriculture department has sought to 
attract students like Lenard by buying more exotic types of sheep from the 
Europe and the Middle East, and even llamas, for wool projects. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as several years ago, Lander said, most of the sheep raised at 
Pierce were bred for slaughter. Now, he said, most are used primarily for their 
wool. 
</P>
<P>
 The change mirrors a shift in focus for the entire farming operation at 
Pierce, which began in 1947 with an emphasis on raising cattle, pigs and 
chickens for meat, and which has recently suffered major cutbacks, said Mick 
Sears, chairman of the agriculture department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years, he said, the populations of sheep, cattle and pigs 
have dwindled in half -- to about 30 heads of each -- as the department adjusts 
to students' greater interest in veterinary science, horse raising and other 
small-scale animal projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is the growing perception among students, especially in an 
urban area like this, that agriculture is something that is only practiced out 
on the range," Sears said. "Also, most people feel it is difficult to make 
money that way, whether that is true or not." 
</P>
<P>
 As the face of animal science at Pierce has changed, Sears said, more women 
have become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, most of the 600 or so students taking classes in the 
agriculture department were men, Sears said. Now, he said, the number of 
students has dropped to about 400, more than 60% of whom are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenard, for one, is glad for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the old guys laugh when they see us out here spinning wool," she 
said. "It's a macho thing. But I don't care." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BOARD OKS STUDY OF EVENING HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Board of Education has taken a step toward creating an evening 
high school on the Hoover High School campus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board voted to set up two committees to study the idea, 
designed to alleviate overcrowding among the city's three secondary schools. As 
envisioned, the school would offer classes from 2:15 to 9 p.m. in addition to 
classes from 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the board voted to consider the creation of a night school along 
with several other options to reduce overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 The two committees, the Evening School Planning Task Force and the Career 
Academy Task Force, will have 37 and 33 members, respectively, including 
parents, community representatives, students, teachers, principals and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Evening School Planning Task Force will make recommendations on 
curriculum, extracurricular activities, scheduling, staffing, hours of 
operation and student recruitment strategies, according to a report by Jim 
Gibson, secondary education administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Career Academy Task Force will study whether an evening school should 
emphasize specialized areas such as retail sales, entertainment, publishing, 
and business, or if it should stick to a traditional curriculum, the report 
said. Both committees are scheduled to report to the board in June. 
</P>
<P>
 To implement the evening school proposal, officials face the difficult task of 
convincing a portion of the district's 7,111 high school students that they 
should attend school from 2:15 p.m. to 9 p.m. rather than the traditional hours 
of 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., said Vic Pallos, district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be difficult to recruit kids to attend school at night," Pallos said. 
"We're going to have to come up with an attractive package to get kids to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the evening school would offer classes for 350 students. 
Administrators hope that 700 students in grades nine through 12 will volunteer 
to attend evening school classes within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The board studied other options to relieve overcrowding, including year-round 
schooling, building a new high school, boundary changes and open enrollment, 
which allows students to choose to attend a school other than the one in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these recommendations, board members voted to table open enrollment and new 
school construction. To help with overcrowding in the short term, three 
portable classrooms will be added at Glendale High School for the 1994-1995 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round schooling is not a feasible option at the high school level because 
of sports and advanced placement class schedules, Pallos said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

 The city has been reimbursed $35,239 for the cost of a citywide special 
election last November on the controversial Measure A.  
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. and the Newport Conservancy last year agreed to pay for the 
cost of the election.Voters were asked to decide whether to purchase 138 acres 
of prime acreage near the Upper Newport Bay for $68 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Irvine Co. paid its half and on Monday, the Newport 
Conservancy paid its portion, said Councilwoman Jean H. Watt, who is also 
president of the environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is nice to have it done," Watt said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A lost by a wide margin -- about 65% of Newport voters opposed the 
plan.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; YMCA KICKING OFF YEARLY FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The West County Family YMCA is kicking off its annual fund-raising campaign 
this month to support its youth programs and hopes to top last year's $50,000 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many kids that get lost in the shuffle, and those are the kids 
we're really trying to reach out to," said Greg Guest, a longtime YMCA member 
and fund-raising volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go toward defraying the cost of the YMCA's many youth programs, 
including a weeklong camping trip in the San Bernardino Mountains, swimming and 
karate lessons and the 75-year-old national Indian Guides program that 
encourages parents to become more involved with their children through outdoor 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 children participate in the West County YMCA programs, said 
Executive Assistant Kevin Dugoncevick. The association has served children in 
Huntington Beach, Westminster, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove, Seal Beach and 
Cypress for 30 years, and provides scholarships to those who cannot afford the 
price of activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although children must pay to participate in the activities, the fees do not 
cover all the costs of the programs and scholarships, she said. The weeklong 
camping trip, for example, costs between $150 and $250 for each child, but the 
YMCA will take children who can only afford to pay $5, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the association's $1.02-million budget comes from fees for its 
after-school child-care program, Dugoncevick said. About 5% comes from fund 
raising.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY'S RANCHO AREA TO ALLOW MOVIE STUDIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motion picture studios can now move into a business zone of Burbank's Rancho 
neighborhood, but only after obtaining a permit from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 An amendment to city zoning laws to allow the change was approved by the City 
Council in a 4-1 vote Tuesday night, with Councilman Bob Bowne dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 The change alters the Rancho Master Plan, adopted by the city last year to 
preserve the mainly single-family residential area, which also includes some 
properties that permit horse ownership. The master plan eliminated some 
business uses -- including studios -- in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's action was prompted by a developer who had tried to interest a small 
motion picture studio in the site of the now-vacant Von's store on Alameda 
Avenue. The studio lost interest in the location, but the developer, Rediger 
Investment Corp. of Burbank, went ahead with a request for a zoning amendment, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted McConkey, head of a local homeowners group, said he objects to the zoning 
change because a "motion picture studio" is too broadly defined. But William J. 
Smith, a member of the committee that drew up the master plan, said that even 
though studios were omitted from the list of acceptable uses, he would support 
the change if any studio was required to get a permit from the city to locate 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In considering the change, city officials originally suggested that the 
studios simply be listed as an accepted use, but that sound-stage floor area be 
limited to no more than 10% of the property. But the council rejected that 
suggestion, and instead required that each studio wanting to locate in the area 
get a conditional use permit, given after review by the Planning Board and, 
possibly, the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council extended the city's early retirement incentive 
program, created to help balance the budget for the 1992-93 fiscal year. 
Officials promised employees that there would be no layoffs. But a freeze was 
placed on wages until this year and other cost-cutting measures were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 11 employees have taken the early retirement offer, and with the other 
steps the city saved nearly $800,000. The action Tuesday night gives any 
employee retiring between April 1 and Sept. 1 of this year an additional two 
years credit on their service record. City officials expect four employees to 
take the offer. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RECALL DRIVE SPARKS FEUD BETWEEN UNIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Efforts to recall Mayor Charles V. Smith and three other City Council members 
have triggered a public fight between the police officers' and firefighters' 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional rivals in local politics, the two unions are now on opposite sides 
of the recall drive. The firefighters, angry about last year's cuts in the Fire 
Department, are supporting the recall, which the police officers oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements this week, officials from both unions have also charged each 
other with using the recall as part of attempts to sway the council at a time 
when both unions are in the midst of contract negotiations with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters have been working without a contract since Dec. 31, 1992. The 
police officers, whose contract expired last December, have been negotiating a 
new contract for the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (police officers) have invested a lot of money on this council," said 
Mike Garrison, a director of Westminster Firefighters Local 2425. "They don't 
want this council removed." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the police officers union spent more than $40,000 to support Smith 
and council members Charmayne S. Bohman, Tony Lam and Frank G. Fry Jr. Fry is 
not a target of the recall. The fourth recall target, Councilman Craig 
Schweisinger, was elected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters supported Smith's opponent, Joy Neugebauer, and council 
candidate Margie Rice, who both lost the election. The firefighters union 
contributed more than $5,000 to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort, launched last October, stems from the council's decision to 
cut more than $1 million from the Fire Department's budget last year, a move 
that led to layoffs and one firetruck being put out of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Brackett, president of the 100-member Westminster Police Officers Assn., 
said that charge is unfair and inaccurate, "because if this council is a police 
union council, we should have a contract by now." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being asked for take-aways in employee benefits," Brackett said. "The 
council is trying to work with a budget. If it means we have to take cuts, as 
long as they are justified, we have to take those cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Brackett said that Smith, Schweisinger, Bohman and Lam should not be recalled 
"just because they cannot afford $1 million for the Fire Department to spend on 
overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Brackett said the "firefighters can not justify their excessive overtime. They 
have exceeded their $75,000 overtime budget (for this fiscal year) in just 1 
1/2 months." 
</P>
<P>
 According to city financial records, the Fire Department spent more than 
$280,000 in overtime from July 1 to Sept. 15, 1993. Firefighters union 
officials say the overtime is justified because city officials have refused to 
hire more firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Registrar of Voters is in the process of verifying the signatures 
turned over by recall proponents Feb. 21 to determine if there are enough valid 
names to call a recall election. City Clerk Mary Lou Morey said that she 
expects the registrar to finish the check by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 If a recall election is held, it will likely coincide with the June 7 state 
primaries, Morey said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; COUNCIL DECIDES TO QUIT LEAGUE OF CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to drop out of the League of California Cities 
because of dissatisfaction with the organization and to save $28,000 in annual 
membership dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater, a critic of the organization, said during 
Tuesday's council meeting that the league had become a "social club not 
interested in listening to our concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadwater also complained that Garden Grove has to pay higher membership fees 
than most other cities because of its population (149,700), but has only a vote 
equal in value to smaller cities that pay less dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing against the pullout, Councilman Ho Chung said the league has performed 
valuable services for Garden Grove and that tough economic times make it an 
especially bad time to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 "All cities should be working together more than ever," Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to drop out of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Kessler, who joined Chung in casting a dissenting vote, said the 
decision makes Garden Grove an outcast among cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are like a little boat that's stuck in the water without an engine," he 
said after the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove is the second of the state's 470 cities to leave the league, 
officials said. Redlands withdrew last year because of money problems but is 
planning to rejoin later this year, a Redlands City Council spokeswoman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove City Manager George L. Tindall recommended renewing membership, 
claiming that the league provides the city with valuable services, including 
legislative advocacy, legal information and municipal training services. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Hodge, executive director of the Orange County division of the 
League of California Cities, said Wednesday it was unclear how long Garden 
Grove will be permitted to participate in local division matters because of its 
decision to not renew its membership at the state level. The city has paid 
local dues through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodge said he is hopeful that Garden Grove will rejoin the league when city 
officials realize that it's a valuable resource, particularly in dealing with 
major economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County division works on countywide and regional issues on behalf 
of cities. The division is made up of 154 city council members from the 
county's 31 cities.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; AMBULANCE CONTRACT IS AWARDED TO MEDIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted on Monday to switch ambulance companies, a decision 
council members called one of the toughest they've faced. 
</P>
<P>
 The three firms competing for the franchise were rated nearly equal. But, 
citing superior response time and better equipment, a divided council awarded 
the contract to Medix Ambulance Service, replacing the previous company, 
Southland/Lifefleet Ambulance Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three (emergency care) providers were excellent," said Councilman Joseph 
D. Lowe, who supported Doctor's Ambulance Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William S. Craycraft voted for Lifefleet. "It was a very hard 
choice." He said Lifefleet had provided "excellent" service. "They've been 
absolutely great . . . they've been very active in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1,050-point system developed by the county Fire Department, Doctor's 
picked up 996 points -- two points ahead of both Southland and Medix. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said they were swayed by Medix's rating of 191 points in 
response time, compared with 186 points awarded to Doctor's and 170 points to 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the council put the (franchise) out to bid, we did it because we wanted 
to get the company with the best response time," said Councilwoman Sharon Cody. 
"It was definitely one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make, but I'm 
comfortable with Medix." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will not have to pay the ambulance company because the franchise 
agreement gives the company the right to charge customers for service. 
Ambulance rates are set by the county and range from $225 to more than $300, 
depending on whether a patient needs medication before being taken to the 
hospital. All three firms indicated they would be charging the maximum rate for 
a service call. 
</P>
<P>
 Medix officials said they would move the company's corporate office to Mission 
Viejo, which Cody said influenced her decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If on the odd chance there's a disaster, their vehicles would be close by," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lowe, a county Fire Department captain, wasn't impressed by the firm's 
decision to move or its listed response times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers can be misleading," he said. "I've worked with all three 
(ambulance firms) and I'm most comfortable with Doctor's." 
</P>
<P>
 All three firms had strongly lobbied the council in the weeks before the vote, 
Cody said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; POLICE CHIEF OUTLINES NEIGHBORHOOD PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Randall Gaston released the city's new Community Policing Plan 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is aimed at reducing crime and improving the relationship between 
officers and residents in eight neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen officers are being assigned full time to the program, which will be 
implemented March 14. The program calls for officers to learn the concerns of 
each neighborhood's residents and property owners and help them organize 
Neighborhood Watch programs. It seeks to eliminate feelings of mistrust between 
the department and residents, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for opening four "storefront" police substations in the 
northern, southern, eastern and western parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan does not say which neighborhoods will be targeted, and Gaston did not 
return several calls for comment Wednesday. The neighborhoods were selected by 
the department after input from the city's Gang/Drug Task Force, the Code 
Enforcement Department and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston wrote in a 29-page report on the program that it is needed for several 
reasons, including the public's changing expectations of police officers, 
changes in the city's ethnic composition and the city's increasing crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to deal with community concerns relating to crime, the fear of 
crime, social and physical order and neighborhood decay, the Anaheim Police 
Department has adopted a policing philosophy based on a community policing 
concept," Gaston wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fundamental to this philosophy is the belief that these serious issues can 
only be impacted through strategies that employ a total community effort 
involving police, government, school, church and neighborhood partnerships," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has had similar programs in the past on a trial basis and both 
residents and the police considered them successes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable program targeted the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood between 1989 
and 1992. One officer was assigned full time to the neighborhood, which is 
considered one of the city's most violent. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer's job was to meet with residents and property owners and help them 
deal with their neighborhood's problems. The crime rate did drop and more 
crimes were solved. The program ended when a federal grant dried up. TERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city entered the world of curbside recycling this week with generally 
positive results. City officials said Tuesday that collections of trash and 
recyclables during the first two days of the long-awaited recycling program 
occurred on time and with few problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than two dozen residents have complained to officials about the bulky 
size of the 100-gallon recycling bins that households must use to dispose of 
their trash and recyclables, according to council members. Residents said the 
4-foot-tall bins are difficult to move and don't fit through their side gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The College Park East and Marina Hill districts are the first sections of Seal 
Beach to begin the recycling programs. Homes in those areas were given two 
100-gallon bins late last week -- one for normal trash, the other for 
recyclables. About 10,000 people live in the two neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The bins are much larger than normal 50-gallon trash cans, and residents soon 
realized the containers were difficult to move and store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't go through some of these narrow side gates, so some people have to 
leave the (bins) outside in the front," said Councilman Frank Laszlo, who has 
received more than 10 complaints about the containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens who live alone are especially concerned about the bins, which 
they said are hard to move and far too big for the amount of garbage generated 
by small households, Laszlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said residents can request to have their 100-gallon bins 
replaced with smaller 66-gallon models. But in most cases, it will take several 
weeks for the containers to be exchanged. There is also talk of eventually 
offering residents 33-gallon containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe said the recycling program has been warmly received by 
environmentally conscious residents who until now have had to take their 
bottles, cans and newspapers to a center at Cal State Long Beach for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Town district will be added to the recycling program this summer. The 
gated communities of Leisure World and Surfside use private hauling services 
and will not be affected by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is contracting with Briggeman Disposal Services for the recycling 
service.SHELBY GRAD

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ARTIST SKETCHES FOR STREETSCAPES WIN APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Streetscapes, an ambitious plan to attract more pedestrian traffic along 
Ventura Boulevard, has inched closer toward reality with the approval of artist 
sketches for the busy thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board accepted the designs late 
Tuesday. Although the project is not yet funded, officials hope that the 
designs offer a first glimpse of how the boulevard might look one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Robinson, a landscape architect representing Woodland Hills, presented 
her sketches and said her goal is to give the area a more rural feeling through 
the use of more greenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have a more rural feel than urban feel," Robinson said. That will 
mean planting more trees and incorporating them with three distinct proposed 
districts -- historical, educational and center city. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, chairman of the review board, said the first work on Streetscapes 
probably won't come until 1995, but "a lot of things have to happen before 
then. We are in a very preliminary stage." Streetscapes is predicted to cost 
$100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from five communities along the boulevard, including 
homeowners and business people, have worked on the project for six months. 
Architects have been donating their time to create a different identity for 
each area, from Woodland Hills to Universal City, Brain said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Nelson, an architect representing Tarzana, said he plans to increase 
the number of trees in his area. "Edward Rice Burroughs founded Tarzana and was 
the creator of Tarzan," he said. "So we want to create a jungle-like area." He 
also proposed using brick paving, perpendicular street parking on the street 
and flowers to make the area more "pedestrian friendly."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; 2 PLEAD NO CONTEST IN ASBESTOS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men pleaded no contest Wednesday to charges that they worked as safety 
monitors on a North Hollywood asbestos removal project without being qualified 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Harold S. Vites ordered Dennis J. 
Gray, 33, and Ivan D. Paxton, 27, who had worked at a city Department of 
Transportation building in North Hollywood, to pay a total of $13,500 in fines 
and surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray and Paxton, who were not certified asbestos safety monitors at the time, 
nonetheless monitored concentration levels of airborne asbestos at the facility 
in the spring of 1993. In June of that year, after they had been caught working 
illegally, they earned their certifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Vincent B. Sato, who handled the case, denied that the city 
had been overly aggressive in prosecuting the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is quite clear," he said. "You can't act as a site surveillance 
technician independently without being certified by the state. That's a crime. 
. . . A consultant has an economic incentive to use uncertified people while (a 
certified supervisor) is not there because they can do more sites, to make more 
money. That's why the penalties are so harsh -- to discourage this kind of 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sato said there were no signs that the public or asbestos workers had been 
exposed to unsafe levels of the substance, which if inhaled can cause lung 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Sadowsky, Gray's and Paxton's attorney, said the law in this matter is 
not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with a new statute, which is very poorly written," he said. 
"(Gray and Paxton) and their employer were under the impression that they could 
do the work that they were doing on an asbestos-related project. The fines were 
heavy, but . . . for them to fight the matter would have been far more 
expensive. The employer decided that it was best for everyone concerned to try 
to resolve the case, and that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiated settlement provided for Paxton to pay $8,100 in fines and 
surcharges and Gray, $5,400. If the case had gone to trial, they could have had 
to pay as much as $97,200 between the two of them, Sadowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA officials found the two technicians working at the facility when they 
inspected the asbestos removal project in May, Sato said. The building, at 
12544 Saticoy St., is a former warehouse being used by the parking enforcement 
bureau. KAY HWANGBO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; WATER DISTRICT SEEKS TO KEEP CITY IN FOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials at the Los Alamitos County Water District said they will fight a 
proposal by Los Alamitos to break away from the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 After a unanimous vote last week, water district directors said the proposal 
will not benefit the 7,000 households and business users the district serves. 
Instead, the plan could result in higher fees, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district, created in 1952 before Los Alamitos became a city, 
maintains about 64 miles of sewer lines in Los Alamitos, Rossmoor and portions 
of Seal Beach and Cypress. The district, which services only the sewer system, 
gets an average of $1.25 a month from property owners, which is added to their 
property taxes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council approved a proposal to take over sewer services 
within the city limits. Los Alamitos makes up about half of the 4,000-acre 
properties that the water district serves. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the city could provide a better service by merging sewer 
services with other public works operations. In addition, the administrative 
cost of a water district office and the salaries of the general manager and 
board directors would be eliminated. A saving estimated as high as $70,000 
could be used to increase the reserve funds for maintenance and future repairs 
of the sewer lines, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials, however, dispute that amount, saying that the 
operational expenses are just a little over $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, council members decided to postpone plans to file an application 
the Local Agency Formation Commission, which would have started the process to 
"detach" from the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi said that more time is needed to study the effects 
of the proposed separation, particularly on the remaining areas of the water 
district. In addition, he said city and water district officials should work 
together and avoid spending taxpayers' money in a public relations war. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the plan should reach LAFCO, and let that agency, which 
is responsible for forming, dissolving, and merging public agencies, decide on 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "LAFCO understands this thing better than we do," Selvaggi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara F. Anderson, LAFCO executive officer, said that there have been 
discussions between herself and Los Alamitos city staff, but she cannot make a 
recommendation yet on the proposal. BERT ELJERA

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; PERMIT OKD TO MOVE LAUREL HALL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After five years of dealing with red tape, Laurel Hall School in North 
Hollywood has been granted permission to move. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Board of Zoning Appeals granted a conditional-use permit that 
allows the school to move from its present location on Radford Avenue to a 
three-acre site across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit was granted on the condition that a proposed wall be pushed back 20 
feet from the property line, which will cut the school's proposed playground by 
about one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is part of a $150-million proposal by Forest City Development, which 
includes converting the aging Laurel Plaza, a one-level mall, into a 
three-level, 1-million-square-foot shopping complex with three new department 
stores, 5,400 parking spaces and room for a 10-story office tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer agreed to relocate Laurel Hall School to make room for the mall. 
If the mall goes forward, the $8-million school will be built next to Emmanuel 
Lutheran Church, which owns the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make room for the monster mall," grumbled Robert Carcia, president of Slow 
the Overdevelopment Process, a community group that has fought the project 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Other conditions included submitting final landscaping plans to Councilman 
Joel Wachs' office for final approval, said Thomas Henry, planning deputy for 
Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will not be moved unless the mall project is approved. Forest City 
Development still faces a Planning Commission hearing that will address zoning 
changes needed before the mall can be expanded, and final approval for the 
entire project by the Los Angeles City Council in a few months. JEANNETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL SETS RECALL ELECTION FOR JUNE 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recall election of three City Council members and the city clerk will be 
held June 7, in conjunction with the state primary elections, the City Council 
decided Tuesday in a unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will be asked whether they want to recall City Clerk Anne M. York, 
Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and Don 
Bankhead. They will also be asked to decide if they prefer another special 
election or an appointment process to fill any vacancy created by the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 All four officials have said they will fight the recall and are in the process 
of setting up a campaign fund, Bankhead said. So far, the four have raised 
$375, McClanahan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Babcock, chairman of the Fullerton Recalls Committee, said his group 
has raised $400 for the recall campaign and will hold its first public 
fund-raiser March 20 at the Ice House in Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the recall will be successful and we want to put our efforts into 
identifying candidates" to fill the posts, Babcock said.  
</P>
<P>
 Babcock said his group is looking for potential City Council candidates who 
will work to repeal the utility tax. The group wants candidates who have never 
worked in the public sector, are strong supporters of a free market system and 
have not opposed the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall election will cost the city $118,500, and a special election to 
fill any vacancy that occurs will cost an additional $118,000, Deputy City 
Clerk Audrey Culver said.  
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began in July, when the City Council voted 3-2 in favor of 
an unpopular 2% tax on water, telephone, electricity, natural gas and cable 
television bills, despite objections from hundreds of residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members Bankhead, McClanahan and Catlin voted in favor of the tax; 
council members Julie Sa and Chris Norby opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, a group of residents formed the Fullerton Recalls Committee to 
punish what they call unacceptable behavior by the council members.  
</P>
<P>
 Babcock said York is a target because she delayed the recall process when she 
rejected recall petitions against the council members, saying they exceeded the 
legal word limit. But York says she was simply doing her job and consistently 
responded within a day to paperwork regarding the recall. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 18 STADIUM BEAMS WILL BE REINFORCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved a $497,000 contract with a construction 
firm to reinforce 18 steel beams at Anaheim Stadium to bring them up to 1994 
seismic building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the Northridge earthquake in January, which toppled the 
stadium's 17-ton Sony Jumbotron scoreboard, dramatized the need to retrofit the 
beams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a safety issue," said City Manager James D. Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was awarded to SME Industries, based in Roseville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they want the work completed by the start of baseball 
season. The California Angels' first preseason game at Anaheim Stadium is April 
2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the costs for the beam work will come out of the stadium's budget 
reserves. The beams were installed in 1980 as part of a stadium renovation that 
lured the Rams to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city is also working to repair the damaged Jumbotron. City 
officials hope to recover those expenses from either the contractors who 
installed the scoreboard or, as a last resort, from federal and state emergency 
relief aid.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CITY PASSES RULES ON REDEVELOPMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously adopted an ordinance imposing deadlines 
on the Redevelopment Agency's ability to establish loans, give cash advances or 
collect taxes to repay debts. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the ordinance is necessary in order to comply with a new 
state law that requires cities and redevelopment agencies to adopt deadlines in 
an effort to curb "real and perceived abuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea has three redevelopment areas. They are in the downtown, north-central 
and northeast parts of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new ordinance, which takes effect in April, the city may not go into 
debt to pay for redevelopment projects in those areas after Jan. 1, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will have 20 to 30 years to stop collecting taxes from 
businesses and residents in the redevelopment areas to repay the debts. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance "just establishes termination dates," said Susan M. Georgino, 
director of redevelopment services. MIMI KO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FIRMS HIT BY QUAKE GET FEE EXTENSION

<P>
 The owners of businesses that were damaged in the Northridge quake will have 
an extra 10 weeks to pay license fees under a proposal approved by the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The relief plan, drafted by Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Joel Wachs and 
passed Tuesday, extends the date at which taxes are considered delinquent to 
May 15.Normally, the fees for business licenses are due Feb. 1 and become 
delinquent March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also waives penalties and interest that the city would normally 
add to late payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday also approved a recommendation by Councilwoman Laura 
Chick to waive all city permit fees for home and business owners who want to 
rebuild quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city will not lose revenue under the proposal because the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency has offered to reimburse the city for the lost 
fees. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SLAVKIN URGES REPORT ON QUAKE RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Convinced that lessons lie in the crumpled bookshelves, fallen light fixtures 
and structural damage left at many schools by the Northridge earthquake, Los 
Angeles school board member Mark Slavkin is calling for a comprehensive report 
to evaluate the district's response to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think anybody can go through an earthquake of this magnitude 
without learning something," Slavkin said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced the motion asking for the report hoping to formalize the 
evaluation process and keep a priority on the issue of earthquake preparedness. 
It is set to go before the school district board for a vote on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of human nature to let the sense of urgency slack and get 
diverted," Slavkin said. "But we can't just say we were lucky and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 If the motion is approved, the evaluation process will include input from 
parents and district employees about what went right as well as wrong at Los 
Angeles Unified School District campuses during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin said that a variety of issues, from cracked walls to employee disaster 
training, need to be addressed. While most schools fared well structurally in 
the quake, Slavkin said the report must examine why some suffered more damage 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the schools, books, chemicals and other materials tumbled from 
cabinets. Bookcases and filing cabinets toppled. Light fixtures and ceiling 
tiles fell from above. Slavkin said the report must address how to make 
internal fixtures and supplies more secure to prevent injury to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Other preparedness measures, which were not tested in the pre-dawn quake, such 
as communication systems, water and food supplies and employee training, he 
said, also need evaluation. SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERISM PROJECT GETS A HELPING HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In setting their 1994 agenda, directors of the fledgling Los Angeles 
Volunteerism Project had pinpointed disaster response as a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Northridge earthquake jolted Los Angeles awake Jan. 17, the 
luxury of planning disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when this happened it was, 'Uh oh. The horse was out of the barn before we 
built the barn,' " said Pat Paolilli, director of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Volunteerism Project, which started in late fall and handled its 
quake relief efforts from the Panorama City office of the Volunteer Center of 
the San Fernando Valley, was designed to coordinate six privately funded 
volunteer centers in Los Angeles County. The aim is to increase volunteerism 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was modeled after a San Francisco program that increased community 
volunteering by 45% in three years. The San Francisco project worked out a 
disaster plan for that area in response to the Loma Prieta quake, but the Los 
Angeles group had not gotten that far. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we just started working," Paolilli said. "Our colleagues in San Francisco 
faxed us some plans." 
</P>
<P>
 The project brings together the volunteer centers of the San Fernando Valley, 
Greater Pomona Valley, Los Angeles , La Mirada, San Gabriel Valley and South 
Bay-Harbor-Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the quake, volunteers from all six centers filed into the 
San Fernando Valley center in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, 10 telephone lines had been installed and calls from people 
wanting to volunteer and agencies needing manpower starting pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Friday noon it was clear to us we were under-phoned. So we ordered 20 more 
lines," Paolilli said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 36 days it took calls, the hot line matched 3,600 volunteers with about 
600 agencies that asked for help, said Suzanne Lewis, the center's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the immediate crisis is over, operators are monitoring the phones 
until Friday, taking messages and suggesting volunteering opportunities.

 About 20 Orange County sheriff's deputies are expected to call in sick today 
as part of a job action protesting eight months of unsuccessful contract 
negotiations with the county, a deputies' association spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is not to have an adverse impact on the Sheriff's Department or 
the citizens of the county," said Robert MacLeod, general manager of the Assn. 
of Orange County Sheriff's Deputies. "We merely need to let the county know, in 
as modest a way as possible, that our members are frustrated by the bargaining 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod said the association's 1,300 members overwhelmingly supported the job 
action, which will affect only the northern unincorporated areas of the county. 
He said there will be more protests if the county does not respond with a 
better wage and benefit package. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Sheriff Walter W. Fath said the job action will "not disrupt 
service" to any of the communities covered by the North Division. No city that 
contracts for Sheriff's Department services will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's "blue flu" job action will be "of limited scope" and occur during the 
day shift. It will last about 8 1/2 hours and involve about 11 patrol officers 
and 10 investigators from the department's North Division, MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod said the association is asking for a three-year contract with a 3.5% 
pay raise for both the second and third years. The deputies are not asking for 
a raise in the first year. The county has offered 3% raises for the second and 
third years.  
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod also said the county is not sufficiently funding medical and other 
benefits for deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies have been working without a contract since October. Negotiators 
from the association and county had been meeting for four months before the 
contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider declined to discuss the details 
of the county's offer, but called it a "fair offer."  
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, who was aware of the deputies' plans to protest, said the sickout 
will have "no effect" on his recommendations to the Board of Supervisors 
regarding the contract. He added that the county will not seek a court order to 
prevent the deputies' job action. 
</P>
<P>
 Fath said deputies from the midnight shifts will remain on duty today and 
deputies from the evening shifts will be brought in early to cover the absent 
patrol deputies.

PLACENTIA OKS $10,000 REWARD IN CATHY TORREZ SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The City Council has approved a $10,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the person or people involved in the stabbing death of 
Cal State Fullerton student Cathy Torrez, raising to $30,000 the amount being 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's employer, Sav-On Drugs, and her union, United Food and Commercial 
Workers Local 324, each have offered $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council originally had planned to offer a $5,000 reward, but increased the 
amount when it realized how much the two other organizations were offering. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city should (offer) at least $10,000," Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode said 
during Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved two proposals to honor Torrez, 20, whose body was 
found in her car in the parking lot of Placentia Linda Community Hospital on 
Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's new learning center, located about one mile from the house where 
Torrez lived with her family, will be called the Cathy Torrez Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Naming the learning center, which opened in Placita Santa Fe last December, 
for Torrez is a fitting tribute because Torrez worked at two local schools, in 
addition to her job at Sav-On, Eckenrode said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a learning center, and she worked as a tutor at Ruby Drive Elementary 
and Valencia High School," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also decided to plant a tree in her memory at Kraemer Park, where 
Torrez worked as a summer day-camp leader two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Bennett, Torrez's mother, said Wednesday she appreciates all that the 
city is doing to "keep Cathy's memory alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez was an honor student at Cal State Fullerton, majoring in sociology. She 
wanted to be a social worker or a juvenile probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, one student will be reached by this and will be inspired by what 
Cathy was trying to do and will be able to accomplish the things that Cathy 
wanted to do," Bennett said. "I want to believe that something wonderful can 
come from this tragedy."

JUDGE FINDS GM GUILTY IN WASTE WATER DUMPING CASE; ENVIRONMENT: THE AUTO MAKER 
IS ORDERED TO PAY $9,594 FOR THE INCIDENT BUT WILL PROBABLY FILE AN APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 General Motors Corp. on Wednesday was found guilty of an illegal waste water 
discharge from its former Van Nuys auto assembly plant and ordered to pay 
$9,594 in fines and costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing in Los Angeles Municipal Court stemmed from an incident last 
year in which GM maintenance workers flushed about 17,000 gallons of chemically 
contaminated waste water into Tujunga Wash in Van Nuys instead of properly 
disposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, GM and city prosecutors are expected to appeal the decision by 
Municipal Judge S. Patricia Spear, who found the company guilty of a single 
misdemeanor count while dismissing two other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that we had a finding of guilty," said Deputy City Atty. Don 
Kass. "I'm hopeful that we're going to prevail on appeal to resurrect the 
charges that were dismissed," Kass said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM attorney Gary A. Feess could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, filed last June, involved the discharge of a blend of water and 
the corrosion-inhibiting chemical Dearborn 547, which is a mixture of sodium 
hydroxide, sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite. Workers preparing to dismantle 
cooling towers at the auto plant on Jan. 27, 1993, drained the fluid, which 
flowed along the ground and into the wash, which empties into the Los Angeles 
River in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were alerted when a nearby resident reported seeing a 
reddish-colored liquid in the wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of disposing of the waste in a legal and environmentally safe manner, 
two maintenance workers merely opened valves and allowed the mixture of water 
and chemicals to flow onto the ground," said City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was found guilty of a single violation of the state Department of 
Fish and Game code, while a charge of violating the state water code and a 
second fish and game count were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 GM was ordered to pay the maximum fine of $2,000, a $3,400 penalty assessment, 
and $4,194 for investigative costs of the state Department of Fish and Game and 
Los Angeles County Fire Department. GM also was placed on two years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker manufactured Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds at the 
plant at 8000 Van Nuys Blvd., but ceased production there in 1992.

PROSECUTOR CHALLENGES SUSPECT'S ALIBI IN SLAYING 
</P>

<P>
 Continuing to profess his innocence, a parolee accused of killing an 
armored-truck guard during a robbery underwent a withering cross-examination 
Wednesday from a prosecutor who hammered away at inconsistencies in his alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Often raising his voice and gesturing with his arms, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff 
Jonas hurled a barrage of questions at Sean Darnell Slade, 27, who is accused 
of murdering Edwin Maldonado on July 20, 1992, during a robbery at the Home 
Depot in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want to tell the jury?" Jonas asked Slade at the start of 
questioning. "Look them in the eye," the prosecutor demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I'm not guilty," Slade responded. "Second, all this right here didn't 
have to be. Thirdly, certain people wanted to see bad things happen in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed on who wanted "bad things" to happen, Slade looked at Jonas and 
said: "Starting with you." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant also accused Elizabeth Floyd, the mother of a man Slade 
admittedly killed in 1987, of being a liar. After police developed a composite 
drawing of the suspect in the Home Depot slaying, Floyd contacted authorities 
and said Slade was the man they were looking for. Her information led to his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade pleaded guilty in 1988 to manslaughter in the man's death and was 
sentenced to state prison. He was paroled only 25 days prior to the Home Depot 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maldonado carried $82,000 from the manager's office in the Foothill 
Boulevard home improvement store, a gunman ran up and, without warning, shot 
him in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 When the guard fell to the ground, the robber fired two more shots into his 
head. A Home Depot employee standing a few feet away testified that Slade was 
the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he did when he first took the witness stand Tuesday, Slade reiterated 
that he had nothing to do with the crime.

SANTA ANA MAN WHO DIED IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana man killed in a motorcycle accident Tuesday night has been 
identified as 22-year-old Emigdio Flores Marquez, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez was northbound on Anton Boulevard at a high rate of speed when he lost 
control of his motorcycle, slid along a curb and then was thrown off the bike 
into a tree, said Police Sgt. David Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez, who was not wearing a helmet, died at the scene.  
</P>
<P>
 After he was thrown, Marquez's motorcycle careened another 100 feet before it 
crashed into a tree.

GUARD SHOOTS INMATE DURING BRAWL AT LANCASTER PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A guard shot and wounded an inmate at the state prison here Wednesday, the 
third such incident in the past month and the fourth since the prison opened in 
February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 p.m. shooting occurred after an unknown number of maximum security 
inmates began fighting with "manufactured weapons" and refused orders by guards 
to stop, said prison spokesman Kenn I. Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Three inmates were injured in the fight, although only the gunshot victim was 
taken to a hospital, Hicks said. The other two were treated by prison medical 
staff for superficial wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the three inmates were not released pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about the same time that the prison's new interim 
warden, John Ratelle, took control of the facility after the ouster last week 
of Warden Otis Thurman. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman, who had been in charge of the prison since it opened 13 months ago, 
was told to retire or to accept a demotion and transfer after four escapes, 
including two by maximum security inmates, according to sources in the state 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of maximum security inmates, Hicks said, were on their way from their 
housing unit to the prison yard when an unknown number of them began fighting, 
using improvised knives. 
</P>
<P>
 After orders to halt were ignored, Hicks said, a control-booth officer fired a 
single shot from a 9-millimeter carbine, hitting one inmate in the left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar incident occurred Feb. 9, when a guard shot one of two inmates who 
were fighting and ignored orders to stop. On Feb. 15, a maximum security inmate 
was shot after taking "an aggressive stance" and refusing to leave his cell 
when ordered to do so.

ACTOR FACING CHARGES TO HOST POLICE GOLF TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite recent accusations that his golf swing was employed on the wrong side 
of the law, Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson is scheduled to serve as 
celebrity host of a police-sponsored golf tournament to raise funds for the 
families of slain, sick or injured officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson, who faces criminal charges that he attacked a car with a golf club 
in a Studio City traffic dispute Feb. 8, is slated to host the 23rd 
Police-Celebrity Golf Tournament, scheduled for May 14 at the Rancho Park Golf 
Course in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Promotion of the tournament with Nicholson in that role had begun before the 
actor was charged this week with vandalism and assault by the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office, said LAPD Cmdr. Dave Gascon, the tournament chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon sidestepped questions Wednesday about the effect of the charges on 
Nicholson's role. But he said he hopes that the publicity given the charges 
against the actor will not harm the tournament, organized by the Los Angeles 
Police Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit organization that raised nearly half of 
the $446,000 it spent last year from tournament proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation provides money to the families of officers with catastrophic 
illnesses and has established a college scholarship fund for the children of 
disabled or deceased officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that's not lost and I'm sure Mr. Nicholson and everyone else involved 
want to provide some comfort for the families of these police officers," Gascon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a celebrity, but he has the same rights as anyone else" to a presumption 
of innocence until he stands trial, Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Bressler, Nicholson's agent, declined to comment on whether the actor 
would actually play in the tournament, in which sports and show business 
celebrities are placed in foursomes with police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson, who received a lifetime achievement award from the American Film 
Institute at a Beverly Hills reception Wednesday night, will be arraigned in a 
Van Nuys court March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson also faces a separate civil suit by Robert Blank, 38, of Hollywood, 
owner of the car he allegedly hammered, shattering the windshield. Blank 
contended that he was injured by flying glass and that he feared for his life.

AUDIT URGES REDUCTIONS IN BUS SERVICE, SALARIES; TRANSIT: THE REPORT COMES AS 
THE MTA BEGINS TO DEAL WITH PROJECTED $126-MILLION OPERATING DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To close a massive budget shortfall next year, the county transit authority 
must consider reducing bus service, cutting superfluous administrative 
positions, and slashing salaries and benefits of thousands of employees, a team 
of independent auditors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A report presented to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority recommended 
that the agency eliminate bus routes that run parallel with trolley and subway 
lines, and cut back service on weekends. Management should also endeavor to 
reduce labor costs as it enters into negotiations with the authority's biggest 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no harmless or painless means of reducing the MTA's expenses," the 
report said. ". . . Many require changes either in fundamental policies and 
philosophies, or in the collective bargaining agreements that bear on the bus 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, compiled after a five-week study, comes as the MTA begins to 
grapple with the specter of a $126-million operating deficit in the coming 
fiscal year -- about 20% of the entire operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be, as an organization, . . . under great stress as of July 
1," said MTA chief Franklin White, referring to the start of the next fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit did not address fare increases, but MTA officials are studying the 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison with five other major public transit agencies nationwide, 
including those in New York and Chicago, operations and maintenance costs for 
MTA's bus service hover near the average, according to the report. However, 
wages for drivers and mechanics are at least 10% higher. Sick leave, vacation 
and medical costs have also increased -- by 20% in the last fiscal year alone, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA must press those issues as it begins talks with its major unions 
representing bus drivers, mechanics and clerks, whose contracts expire June 30, 
the audit recommended. The authority should also consolidate some smaller 
operating divisions to cut overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA alternate director Marvin Holen called the report helpful but warned that 
the authority could not "plunge pell-mell ahead" with its recommendations 
absent a more complete picture of the agency's operations -- including an 
analysis of rail services, which auditors were not asked to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 While bus service accounts for nearly 90% of MTA's $710-million operating 
budget, more than half of the shortfall is attributable to rail operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Holen also criticized suggestions that the MTA scale back bus service where 
routes run parallel to rail lines, both above and below ground, and duplicate 
municipal services, as in Culver City and Long Beach. Such a move would 
undermine the authority's attempt to fashion an integrated countywide transit 
system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that savings could accrue from streamlining administration 
of the MTA, a super-agency created when the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission and Southern California Rapid Transit District merged. 
</P>
<P>
 Finances will also probably be an important factor as the authority considers 
appointing a single security force to patrol all of its transit services -- 
rail, bus and subway. Officials are weighing a bid from the MTA's in-house 
police, and one submitted jointly by the county Sheriff's Department and Los 
Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent audit conducted last month concluded that using transit police 
would be more cost-effective at $87 million a year, about $24 million less than 
the LAPD-sheriff's plan. Most of the difference comes from the fringe benefits 
-- especially pension contributions -- that each agency grants its employees, 
according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a reply to the audit, Los Angeles police officials contend that the 
cost difference is actually much smaller, accusing the MTA police of providing 
"artificially deflated" or inaccurate figures. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Police Chief Sharon K. Papa called the accusations a red herring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to divert attention away from a 30% cost difference" between 
the two proposals, she said. "I'm happy that the audit that was done by an 
independent firm said (there is a) $24-million difference, because it validates 
what we've said all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the in-house force patrols buses and the Red Line, while the 
Sheriff's Department covers the 22-mile Blue Line trolley under a $13.5-million 
agreement. The sheriff's contract ends June 30.

AROUND THE VALLEY: THIS WRITER SPARES AUDIENCE NO PUNCHES -- AND THEY LOVE IT

<P>
 The eager, sober-faced audience knew they were in for it when Harlan Ellison 
asked how many of his listeners fancied themselves writers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the crowd of about 160 people shifting uncomfortably on hard 
chairs in a room at the Warner Center Marriott raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison, who has written stories about people caught flat-footed and 
slack-jawed in the face of unexpected danger, paused a moment, perhaps to allow 
the weaker-willed people time to flee before he pounced. Then he recalled a 
line from an obscure writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are already too many people who mistake a love of reading for a talent 
for writing," he said. Then he looked up. "You think I'm going to savage you. I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began an evening with Harlan Ellison, a small man of pugnacious good 
humor who has been described as a "prolific author, fiery critic and general 
all-around nuisance." Ellison, whose credits include 60 books, numerous 
television scripts and short stories, some of which are among the most 
reprinted stories in the English language, stalked the room, microphone in 
hand, fulminating against the idiots that bark at his heels and mischievously 
telling unflattering stories on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, he almost seemed to be daring his worshipful listeners to disapprove 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the vaguely worded topic, "On Being a Writer," gave Ellison the 
opportunity to rage against the things that irritate him as a writer. When 
asked the repugnant question "where do you get your ideas?" he invariably says 
he subscribes to an idea service in Schenectady. "Inevitably, at the end of the 
lecture, some ----- will ask for the address," he said, then warned everyone in 
the room not to make that mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison's scoldings reflect his belief in the need for an artist to separate 
himself from the people who appreciate his work. He feels a writer "must not 
only ignore his audience, he must despise his audience . . . For better or 
worse, I have an adversarial relationship with my audience." 
</P>
<P>
 He told two particularly unflattering stories about himself. In the first, he 
described in detail how he beat a traffic ticket he deserved by lying to the 
judge so convincingly that the policeman who gave him the ticket threatened him 
outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he avoided the policeman's patrol area. 
</P>
<P>
 The second story was even nastier. Awakened during a cold snap by a 
misdirected call from a man asking for a cab to be sent to pick him up, he told 
the man to stand on the frozen street until the car arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last I heard he was a statue," Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recounted his bon mot when a fan asked him an insulting question. 
"When I hear a question like that, I think 'you weren't born yesterday, because 
nobody could get that stupid in 24 hours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's mean," he said of his behavior. "I'm not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing he did could break the spell over people who paid up to $45 each 
to the Learning Tree University to hear him fulminate against everything from 
the fools who screwed up the printing job on his most recent book to critics to 
his own fans. 
</P>
<P>
 His listeners seemed to enjoy it in the same way people seek out restaurants 
whose waiters insult the guests, as though being ill-treated was part of the 
fun of the experience, even when the person handing out the abuse insists he is 
in deadly earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a crack-up," said Julie Ustin, a clinical art therapist of 43 who likes 
to write and illustrate children's stories. She hasn't published any yet. 
Worse, a bad case of writer's block has stymied her writing for the past three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 She hoped Ellison might help break the shell that had hardened around her. 
"He's getting me off," she said during a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hoping for inspiration was Susan Tombrelli, a 31-year-old hospital public 
relations woman who has written since she was 4 and has produced several novels 
"I wouldn't show anyone if they bribed me." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Ellison's barbs had scared her off, she demurred. "He's very 
entertaining," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of her need to write, it's beyond choice anyway. "Unfortunately, I can't help 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison wears his rage and his opinions as heavily and proudly as a Russian 
general wears his decorations. But, for this crowd at least, it was no more 
possible to disapprove of him than to hate Hulk Hogan or Charles Barkley or any 
of those other figures of uniquely American dimensions, people so outsized that 
a new measuring system is required to chart the breadth and depth of their 
personae. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the star athletes, whose form of self-inflation can be distilled as 
soliloquies to the "wonder of me," Ellison was by turns literate and prideful, 
then -- possibly tiring of the professorial -- vulgar and spiteful. And always, 
and this is surely why they came, entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he proposed calling the seminar "Conversations With God And 
Other Useless Activities." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was spared his barbs, even himself. He admitted he is not his favorite 
author, though he made it clear he is pretty damn good in his own eyes. 
Self-reviewing his latest book, "Mefisto In Onyx," he said it would "blow your 
underwear off." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the thousands of people throughout history who have made a living 
writing, he said only three or four have really made a difference. "For the 
most part," he said, "we are toilers in fields of lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this, there seemed something more purposeful to his rants than 
simply to play the mischief-maker. Perhaps this was his way of finding the 
freedom to write, by rejecting all other demands people laid on him so he could 
find his way back to that place where he first discovered inspiration. Then 
again, perhaps he just likes to set off little incendiary devices in his 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wind up with a lot of enemies because I will not perform," he said, then 
dismissed the pretense in the remark: "Not that I think I'm so ---- special."

FIRE IN AN UNOCCUPIED WING OF DISNEYLAND HOTEL SOON CONTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire broke out in an unoccupied, two-story section of the Disneyland Hotel 
complex about 8:55 p.m. Wednesday and was contained in about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was confined to the second floor of the structure, which was being 
renovated, but officials did not immediately know how it started or how much 
damage was done.There were no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the blaze may have broken out on the ground floor, where 
plumbing work was being done earlier Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was discovered by hotel employees, according to Lindsay Schnebly, 
manager of publicity for Disneyland Resorts. No other buildings in the complex 
were threatened by the fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, at 1150 W. Cerritos Ave., is called Villa 15, and contains 
meeting rooms and some guest rooms. It is detached from the main towers of the 
Disneyland Hotel, according to Anaheim fire officials.  
</P>
<P>
 By 10 p.m., some firefighters were still working to extinguish hot spots in 
the walls, but others were being sent back to their stations.

JUNIOR HIGH TEACHER CHARGED IN MOLESTATION OF FORMER STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Kraemer Junior High School teacher has been charged with molesting a 
14-year-old boy, court officials confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Lynn Smith, 36, of Orange was arrested by Placentia police at 12:20 
a.m. on Feb. 26, department spokeswoman Corinne Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had received an anonymous phone call regarding "possibly suspicious" 
activity in a parked car in the 1600 block of Sierra Madre Circle, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, they made contact with two people in the car -- Smith 
and a 14-year-old boy, Loomis said. Smith was arrested on suspicion of child 
molestation and booked at County Jail. She later posted $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged victim, a former student of Smith's, was not placed in protective 
custody, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 As required by state law, Smith was "assigned to home duty" after her arrest, 
said Tim Van Eck, assistant superintendent of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified 
School District. Smith will continue to be paid pending the outcome of an 
investigation based on the criminal case, Van Eck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith faces eight charges of child molestation. Her arraignment is scheduled 
for March 28 in Municipal Court in Fullerton. All of the felony counts 
pertained to one youth.

ARMORED TRUCK'S GUARD IS ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An man disguised in a postal uniform robbed an armored truck guard Wednesday 
as he was making a delivery at the American First Federal Credit Union, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man entered the credit union in the 6800 block of Knott Avenue about 10:30 
a.m., according to Sgt. Robert R. Chaney Jr. A few minutes later, a transport 
company guard with a money bag walked into the bank and was confronted by the 
robber, who displayed a semiautomatic handgun and ordered the guard to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber fled with the money in what police believe was a late 1980s Honda 
Accord.

WOMAN FENDS OFF ASSAULT WITH FAST THINKING AND SWIFT KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quick-thinking, 20-year-old woman used a hip roll and a swift kick in the 
groin to fend off an assault, the Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that about 8:30 p.m. 
Tuesday, she entered the underground parking garage at her apartment in the 
22700 block of Lake Forest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 She noticed a man under a vehicle and assumed he was making repairs. But as 
she got out of her car, the man attacked her from behind, reaching around and 
unzipping her pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "My baby was in the car," the woman said, "and at first I just wanted him to 
get away from me and the baby. She was in the back seat, crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had no self-defense training, the woman knocked the man backward 
with her hip, spun around and kicked him in the groin. That sent the assailant 
to his knees, and he was last seen crawling out of the garage on all fours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had couple seconds of panic," the woman said, "and then then I told myself 
not to panic -- that's the worst. . . . When I figured out what he wanted, I 
took control of the situation," she said. "I just wanted him to get away from 
the car and away from the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies are looking for the man, Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband has been out all day trying to find Mace or pepper spray," the 
woman said.

SAN CLEMENTE COMPLETES WATER DEAL WITH MARINE BASE; UTILITIES: OFFICIALS SAY 
SUPPLIES PIPED FROM CAMP PENDLETON WILL COST 25% LESS THAN WHAT IS BEING PAID 
TO CITY'S MAIN SUPPLIER, THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 City water customers will see their rates go down because of a water rights 
lease recently approved with Camp Pendleton, water district officials told the 
City Council on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Contradicting earlier concerns expressed by the council and community, Tri 
Cities Water District officials said underground water piped from Camp 
Pendleton will cost 25% less than water from the district's current supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Metropolitan Water District has told us their rates will double in the 
next five to seven years," said Craig Strickland, a Tri Cities board member. 
"Therein lies the benefit." The estimated $5-million cost of drilling the wells 
will be paid by Tri Cities. The Marine Corps will repay its half of 
construction costs by giving water to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the project could be completed by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente water users make up about 70% of the district's 70,000 customers. 
The district also serves portions of San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the San Mateo Groundwater Basin, the underground reservoir holds 
enough water -- about 2,000 acre-feet -- to supply San Clemente and other 
district customers for several months in case of a water emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the basin will be used as an emergency backup, the district will be 
able to draw the water under other circumstances. For example, if Tri Cities' 
main supplier, the MWD, increased its rates beyond what Camp Pendleton would 
charge for water use, the local agency could tap the underground reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be some limits on the amount of water the Tri-Cities district can 
use, although exact amounts haven't been established yet, say Marine officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The MWD is offering rate credits to Southern California agencies that find new 
water supplies within their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Karolyn Koester questioned the quality of the water, saying another 
Camp Pendleton reservoir had been fouled by waste water from the base's 
treatment plant.  
</P>
<P>
 But Marine officials said the San Mateo Basin is not connected to that water 
treatment plant, and the water there is of high quality.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the water agency completed the deal to stave off consolidation of 
the Tri-Cities district with three other local water authorities, an idea being 
considered by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's agreement was the result of about five years of discussions with 
Camp Pendleton officials, who might not want to work with a new, consolidated 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract allows the Marines to back out if a new water agency is created. 
</P>
<P>
 But Col. Steve Fisher, community planning officer for the base, said, "We 
think the deal has merits no matter who will be there," he said. "Wejust needed 
to protect ourselves (with an escape clause) because this is our sole source of 
water and we're going to protect it."

14 DEPUTIES COMPLETE SPANISH-LANGUAGE COURSE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE SEVEN-MONTH 
PROGRAM STRENGTHENS INTERVIEWING, INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS. CLASSES ARE NOW 
TEACHING 90 ADDITIONAL OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some Orange County sheriff's deputies have been moonlighting at night. Not as 
security guards, but as students, learning Spanish to better serve and protect 
county residents who don't speak English.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, they received felicidades for their efforts as 14 
deputies graduated from a seven-month course where they learned to ask 
questions in Spanish such as, "Can I see your license and registration?" and 
"What does the suspect look like?" 
</P>
<P>
 They were a part of a first-time Spanish class given through the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. In addition to the approximately $300 per pupil paid by 
the department, deputies spent about $250 of their own money and about 150 
hours of their time on lab work and conversation drills. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: "These students have reached the level of functioning fluency," 
said Guillermo R. Frixione, CEO of One Twelve USA, the Burbank-based language 
school that taught the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nine more classes teaching about 90 deputies are underway, and those 
students are expected to graduate in about one month, according to Joe Davis, 
the lieutenant who heads the Laguna Niguel sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Other police departments offering Spanish classes to their officers include 
those in Fullerton and Santa Ana where classes have been taught for the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really helps interviewing a victim," said Deputy Ralph Lumm, a course 
graduate. "I was working evenings and making lots of traffic stops. I thought 
it would be a lot easier . . instead of (the suspect) using broken English and 
me using broken Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking the course, Lumm would sometimes ask a passerby to serve as an 
interpreter, or call in a bilingual officer for help, which could take an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that time suspects can get away, and victims and witnesses can change 
their minds or forget things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes took place in the Laguna Niguel sheriff's station and the Laguna 
Niguel City Hall every week in the evenings or on weekends. The participants, 
most beginners, volunteered for the classes and fit them in as their shifts 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We accommodate to any need," said Frixione, whose organization has been 
teaching Spanish to law enforcement workers and other community-based 
organizations in Los Angeles and Orange counties for the past 10 years. "The 
whole idea is that they have a more fluid command of the public they serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Course work ended in September, but because of staff changes at One Twelve, 
the graduation ceremony was not held until Wednesday. In the interim six 
months, at least one graduate's language skills grew rusty. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Lumm on Wednesday had difficulty translating some phrases without 
referring to notes he carries with him in the field. According to Frixione, 
that is not uncommon. The program is 75% successful, he said, adding that some 
students will need to look at their notes when they encounter Spanish speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fluency in the conversation level will depend on the individual, and how 
often they have a chance to use the language. Some are more involved with the 
Hispanic community than others, and have a better chance to expand that 
knowledge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Donna Hendry, who patrols Mission Viejo, said she, too, has forgotten a 
bit since the class ended about six months ago. Since then, "I've pulled my 
books out and I'm trying to review," she said. "When I'm around it, everything 
starts to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The course was easier and more practical than the Spanish she learned in 
school, she said, and now, because she is able to talk to suspects and victims 
in Spanish, they are more cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Teresa Deegan, who teaches drug education and crime prevention in 21 
public schools in the South County area, listened to practice tapes on her 
45-minute commute to and from work. "I can understand so many words now that I 
had no clue of before," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Class valedictorian John Heppert got a chance to practice his language ability 
at the graduation ceremony at Laguna Niguel City Hall on Wednesday morning. 
Given a Cross pen for his good attendance and high tests scores, he said, " Muy 
bonito! " Bilingual Beat 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen Orange County sheriff's deputies graduated from a seven-month course 
Wednesday that taught them Spanish phrases to use when dealing with Spanish 
speakers with limited English skills. Here are some of the phrases, followed by 
their Spanish equivalents, including questions deputies would routinely ask of 
a suspected drunk driver, speeder, or assault victim: 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop the car and get out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alto y salga del carro." 
</P>
<P>
 "Walk a straight line." 
</P>
<P>
 "Camine en linea recta." 
</P>
<P>
 "How much have you been drinking?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuanto ha bebido usted?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you coming from, and where are you going?" 
</P>
<P>
 "De donde viene, a para donde va?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I have you on radar at 65 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour zone." 
</P>
<P>
 "En mi radar lo tengo a 65 millas por hora en una zona de 55 millas por hora." 
</P>
<P>
 "May I see your driver's license and registration?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Puedo ver su licencia de manejar y el registro de su carro?" 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the dates that you are required to go to court to take care of the 
ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 "Estos son los dias que usted tiene que presentarse a corte para arreglar 
estas infracciones." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Esta usted herido?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Donde le duele?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Was this done by a friend, husband or stranger?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Esto fue causado por un amigo, por su esposo o por un desconocido?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What direction did the assailant go?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Por que lado se fue el asaltante?" 
</P>

3 FACE FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CHARGES IN GUARD'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men arrested in connection with the slaying of an unarmed security guard 
were charged Wednesday with first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Lewis R. Rosenblum said his office will prosecute the 
suspects to the fullest extent of the law because of the "senseless and brutal 
nature" of the crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Lee Alonzo Jr., 19, is accused of gunning down former Marine Dagoberto 
Carrero while Carrero was working the night shift as a security guard at the 
Century City Theatre in Orange on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Alonzo fired five shots from a handgun through the 
glass doors, hitting Carrero in the head and the back. Investigators said 
Alonzo shot Carrero because of an argument the two had had a month earlier at 
the movie theater.  
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, the other two defendants, Rafael Maldonado, 20, and Jessie 
Pena, 19, drove Alonzo away from the crime scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblum said Alonzo's two accomplices were charged with murder because they 
aided and abetted the commission of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge B. Tam Nomoto in Santa Ana set bail at $250,000 for each man. 
Their arraignment hearing was postponed until March 25.

MERCURY CLIMBS INTO THE LOW 80S; WEATHER: SLIGHTLY COOLER BUT STILL-SUNNY

LOS ANGELES.

 Unusually warm temperatures, including a record-setting mark in downtown Los 
Angeles, sent many to the beaches Wednesday and made it seem like summer had 
arrived early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, January through March is the rainy season in Southern California," 
said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts 
for The Times."But of the larger storms that usually come through, very few 
have developed." 
</P>
<P>
 While temperatures may cool a bit in the next few days, forecasts call for 
more sunny and dry weather, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, temperatures reached 78 degrees in Santa Ana, 83 in Fullerton and 82 
in Lake Forest. The same-day record for Orange County is 87 degrees, set 16 
years ago in Santa Ana, according to WeatherData. The normal temperature for 
this time of year is about 69 degrees.

<P>
 In downtown Los Angeles, the mercury hit 87 degrees, breaking the 86-degrees 
record set on the same date in 1910, the National Weather Service reported.

 Nowhere was evidence of the heat greater than at local beaches, where bigger

COUPLE KILLED OUTSIDE APARTMENT IDENTIFIED; VIOLENCE: MAN WAS FATALLY SHOT 
WHILE SITTING IN A PARKED CAR. WOMAN IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT WAS SLAIN AFTER SHE 
TRIPPED WHILE FLEEING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities Wednesday identified the bodies of a man and woman killed outside 
a Lancaster apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman said a fingerprint check determined 
that the woman was Latonya Walker, 23, of Adelanto, a town near Victorville in 
San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, also identified through fingerprint records, was identified as Ronald 
Greene, 22, of Upland, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were sitting in a parked car just after midnight Tuesday when a 
man armed with a .44-magnum pistol approached the rear passenger window and 
shot Greene in the head, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who was in the driver's seat, ran from the car but tripped, deputies 
said. She begged the gunman not to shoot, telling him that she had three 
children, witnesses reported. But the man fired three times, striking her in 
the head, hand and upper torso, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman then walked a short distance away, placed the weapon on the ground 
and continued walking, deputies said. Investigators later recovered the gun. 
They also discovered that Greene was carrying several thousand dollars when he 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detectives believe the case may be narcotics-related," Sheriff's Deputy 
Benita Hinojos said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying occurred outside an apartment complex in the 43400 block of 32nd 
Street West. 
</P>
<P>
 "In years past, we've had a lot of problems there with narcotics trafficking 
and gangs," said Sgt. Bob Denham of the Antelope Valley sheriff's station. "But 
for the last several years, it's been very quiet over there." 
</P>
<P>
 No further progress on the case was reported Wednesday. The Los Angeles-based 
homicide detectives assigned to the case were out of town, attending an 
investigators' convention, the sheriff's homicide bureau said.

'FARM' OWNER ACCUSED OF ANIMAL CRUELTY; DISPUTE: AUTHORITIES CONFISCATE 12 
PONIES AND HORSES FROM CHATSWORTH PROPERTY. WOMAN IS DETAINED BY POLICE, THEN 
RELEASED.

<P>
 The owner of Reseda's only pony ride and petting zoo was arrested Wednesday on 
suspicion of animal cruelty -- allegedly in connection with not trimming her 
ponies' hoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal regulation officials also confiscated 12 of Linda Menary's ponies and 
horses from her property in Chatsworth with the aid of Sandi Venables, who runs 
a Chatsworth-based nonprofit horse rescue agency, both Menary and Venables 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals were taken by trailer to the West Valley Animal Shelter, where 
they are awaiting a veterinarian and a horseshoer, Venables said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department 
confirmed that Menary was detained on suspicion of animal cruelty, then 
released. She said she drove herself there after Department of Animal 
Regulation officers told her that she was under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident pitted two of the San Fernando Valley's most prominent 
equestrians against each other. Menary, who owns a pony ride known as "The 
Farm" on Tampa Avenue in Reseda, has been locked in a high-profile tussle with 
city regulators for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently sued the city to prevent officials from shutting down the pony 
ride after she tried and failed to get a land-use permit to keep it open. 
</P>
<P>
 Venables is a former manicurist and bail bondswoman who runs Jolene's Horse 
Rescue, a charity organization devoted to saving horses from neglect, cruelty 
and the slaughterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's incident occurred at a property Menary owns in the 22100 block of 
Chatsworth Street, about several miles northwest of the pony ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Venables recounted with outrage how, acting on a tip, she went onto the 
property Tuesday when Menary wasn't there and took pictures of the animals. She 
then showed the photos to animal regulation officials, and helped them during 
Wednesday's raid. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the horses and ponies had hoofs that had grown five to six inches 
beyond where they should be, a potentially crippling condition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked like little elf feet. . . . It was just unbelievable," Venables 
said. Hoofs should be trimmed every six to eight weeks, Venables said, adding 
that Menary's animals appeared not to have had a trim for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary said she arrived at the property as officials were loading animals into 
trailers, and agreed to turn herself in after calling her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary called the raid an overreaction by animal regulation officers. "I think 
it's harassment," she said. "I think it's retaliation because I sued the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit they (the ponies) needed their feet trimmed and that it was urgent," 
she added. "But they left me a notice that I was to do it within 24 hours. If I 
was in jail, how was I supposed to trim their hoofs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Animal regulation officials could not be reached for comment.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TEACHER FILES CLAIM OVER ALLEGED ASSAULT; 
EDUCATION: THE SANTA CLARITA INSTRUCTOR CONTENDS THE DISTRICT FAILED TO 
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE HER ALLEGATIONS OF A SEXUAL ATTACK BY A COLLEAGUE.

<P>
 A 44-year-old elementary school teacher who was allegedly sexually assaulted 
by a male colleague in a classroom filed a $1-million claim against the school 
district Wednesday for its handling of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gary Paul said the "claim for damages" presented to the Saugus Union 
School District is the first step in suing the government agency, which now has 
45 days to respond. State law dictates that in order to sue a government 
agency, that agency must first be notified in writing that grounds for legal 
action exist. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the claim, district officials failed to thoroughly investigate 
the alleged Nov. 5 attack by teacher and former Sheriff's Deputy Edward Keith 
Culhane on a female fellow teacher at Santa Clarita Elementary School. District 
and school officials then conspired to cover up the alleged attack by directing 
the victim not to report it to law enforcement officials, the claim states. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we find out, the more apparent it becomes how horrendously this 
matter has been handled," Paul said Wednesday. "This situation never should 
have been permitted." 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Troy Bramlett dismissed the claim as "an obvious attempt to get 
some money" that would not stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just see one inaccuracy and one false statement after another," Bramlett 
said. "I don't think the board will give them one penny." 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane, 35, last month pleaded not guilty to felony counts of rape by a 
foreign object, sexual assault and attempted forcible oral copulation stemming 
from the alleged attack. 
</P>
<P>
 He is free on $50,000 bail and is scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing 
March 17. If convicted of all charges, he faces a maximum of 10 years in state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In the claim, Paul said the district "negligently hired Culhane, an individual 
with a long history of engaging in sexual harassment towards women and of other 
sexual misconduct." In a news release issued separately from the claim, Paul 
cited statements made by Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Flotz at Culhane's Feb. 15 
arraignment alleging that Culhane was forced to leave the Sheriff's Department 
because of complaints of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim states that following the attack, "district authorities embarked on 
a systematic program to defame (the alleged victim's) character and to protect 
Culhane from further scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane, who was arrested after the alleged victim filed a criminal complaint 
with the Sheriff's Department on Jan. 14, has been on paid administrative leave 
since Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane was a deputy sheriff with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
from January, 1982, to August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bramlett said that the former deputy came to the district with "glowing 
commendations" from former employers and members of the community, and that 
there was no indication he was capable of violence. He said the Sheriff's 
Department provided only basic information such as dates of employment and 
assignment locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district allowed Culhane to return to work after conducting a 
four-day investigation of the attack that proved inconclusive, Bramlett said 
the board is now seeking to fire the first-year teacher and is asking an 
administrative hearing officer to consider the request. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this step was not taken earlier because the alleged victim would not 
agree to testify -- a claim she disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all going to come down to 'who believes who,' " Bramlett said. "We just 
want to get this thing into a judicial process and then let the chips fall 
where they may."

BERGEN SIGNS 5-YEAR, $285-MILLION PACT WITH DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Giant drug wholesaler Bergen Brunswig Corp. said Wednesday that it has signed 
a $285-million deal with the U.S. Department of Defense to supply the federal 
government with drugs for 20 military hospitals in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year contract, finalized this week, is the largest pact the 
Orange-based firm has signed with the government to date and represents a 
growing trend by Bergen Brunswig and other drug wholesalers to secure large 
distribution agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are out there and they are efficient enough to be competitive," 
said Kevin E. Silverman, a health care analyst with Kemper Securities in 
Chicago. "What's important about this deal is the pattern of signing up the big 
deals." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman said the industry can expect more of the same from Bergen Brunswig, 
a $7-billion-a-year firm that is second only to McKesson Corp. of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bergen Brunswig completes its painful reorganization, which includes 
layoffs of about 500 workers and closure or reductions at some facilities, it 
should be even more competitive, said Silverman, adding that it could operate 
extremely well on margins of about 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Efficiency is the key in this new (health care) environment," Silverman said. 
"And they have it. Not too many businesses can operate on those kind of 
margins." 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract covers 20 military hospitals in Texas, New Mexico and 
Oklahoma, the company said, and is the company's second government contract to 
be signed in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Bergen Brunswig signed a one-year contract worth $19 million to 
supply pharmaceuticals to 18 military hospitals in Philadelphia and Tidewater, 
Va., company spokeswoman Karen Wiley said. That contract also has four one-year 
renewal clauses, each worth about $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bergen Brunswig has also been aggressive recently in securing large 
commercial contracts, Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the company signed a five-year contract with drug retail chain 
ShopKo Stores Inc., based in Green Bay, Wis. That contract to supply 
pharmaceuticals to ShopKo's 118 stores is expected to generate more than $1 
billion in sales and would give it a significant penetration in the upper 
Midwest, where one of Bergen Brunswig's strongest competitors, Cardinal 
Distribution Inc. of Ohio, is based. 
</P>
<P>
 And in December, Bergen Brunswig renewed a contract with American Medical 
International, which is expected to generate about $200 million in sales over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen Brunswig stock rose 25 cents a share Wednesday on the New York Stock 
Exchange to close at $19.875.

 Just A Thought, a new retail business at Fashion Island in Newport Beach, 
sells gift baskets through an outdoor cart at the shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Just A Thought is more than a business, however. It was created with the help 
of a grant from the Department of Rehabilitation and the Alternative Training & 
Learning Center, a nonprofit agency that helps people with disabilities and 
internal head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Just A Thought provides an "integrated work environment" for both disabled and 
non-disabled people, according to Wendy Garrison, manager of Fashion Island's 
specialty retail programs. "It teaches them, step by step, how to become 
self-sufficient and active within the business community."

WESTERN DIGITAL SHARES SURGE WHILE AST'S TAKE PLUNGE; TECHNOLOGY: THE STOCK 
MARKET REACTS SHARPLY TO REVISIONS IN THE TWO O.C. COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS' 
QUARTERLY EARNINGS ESTIMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stock prices for two of Orange County's biggest computer makers moved 
dramatically Wednesday -- though in opposite directions -- after the companies 
revised their quarterly earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 AST Research Inc.'s stock plummeted $5.25 a share to close at $23.50 in heavy 
Nasdaq trading after the personal computer maker said that earnings will fall 
short of earlier projections. In contrast, Western Digital Corp.'s stock shot 
up $2.25 to close at $18 on the New York Stock Exchange after the company 
announced that its results will be better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 For AST, the tumble totaled $8 in a two-day period. The company's stock fell 
$2.75 Tuesday amid rumors that AST will cut its computer prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Edwards, AST's chief financial officer, told analysts in a conference 
call Wednesday morning that sales to North American distributors and resellers 
have dropped, bringing down revenue and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us that AST's sales growth (from a year ago) is going to be only 60% 
instead of 70%," said John Coyle of Standard & Poor's Corp. "That's still a 
nice growth rate, but the pared-down revenue obviously will have an impact on 
earnings." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, analysts had estimated that AST would report earnings of $15.2 
million, or 48 cents a share, for its third fiscal quarter, which ends March 
31. That would compare to profit of $11 million, or 35 cents a share, for the 
same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle said AST's new problems prompted him to revise his third-quarter 
earnings forecast to about $13 million, or 39 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Devlin, AST's vice president of sales for the Americas, said that "a 
number of factors" brought revenue down, including pricing pressures in the 
industry and the Northeast's cold front.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had such a tremendous quarter last quarter that it simply set expectations 
too high," Devlin said. "We wanted to set the right expectations so that when 
we get to the end of the quarter people won't find we gave them information not 
in line with what we finally report." 
</P>
<P>
 While AST's stock took a hit, Western Digital's enjoyed a surge in price.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles A. Haggerty, chairman, president and chief executive officer of 
Western Digital, announced in a press release that earnings for the third 
fiscal quarter ending March 31 should be about $24.7 million, or 55 cents a 
share, well above analysts' projections of 28 to 42 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 For the same period a year earlier, the disk drive maker reported a profit of 
$1.6 million, or 5 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggerty said revenue for the latest quarter will be "north of $425 million," 
more than 30% above last year's third-quarter sales of $325.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Haggerty said the introduction of high-powered chips on the market by 
companies such as Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc. has increased the demand for 
the kinds of high-capacity disk drives that are made by Western Digital.

ADMAR CONTRACT WITH N.Y. LIFE REAPS $100,000

<P>
 The Admar Group Inc. said it has earned about $100,000 so far on a contract 
with a large New York insurance company to negotiate and manage discounted 
hospital fees on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana developer and marketer of managed health care programs said 
Wednesday that its open-ended deal with New York Life Insurance Co., signed 
last July, has led to decreases in hospital costs for about 200,000 New York 
Life members.The company did not specify the cost savings New York Life 
incurred because of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it shows that it has been achieving what we wanted it to do," said 
Admar Group spokesman John Gray. "It's been very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said Admar Group manages, markets and negotiates discounted fees with 
hospitals around the nation for New York Life. Admar Group earns a percentage 
of New York Life's savings from its hospital contracts based on Admar Group's 
performance, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, Admar Group has contracts with 1,400 hospitals and 84 insurance 
companies, covering a total of about 7.2 million members in 38 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who are members of New York Life's Med lect program still pay 20% of 
medical costs under the contract, but since the total costs are held down, 
their share is smaller than what the average patient pays, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Admar Group stock was unchanged on the Nasdaq market, closing at $2.0625 a 
share on Wednesday. The Admar Group

responded by pledging $68,000. So the corporation has donated 13 grants of 
$1,000 each to United Way-funded agencies for the 1993-94 campaign. 
</P>

FDA OKS SALES OF DAVSTAR DEVICE TO TREAT INCONTINENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Davstar Industries Ltd. has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to sell an electrical device that was designed for use by women 
suffering from incontinence. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokeswoman Lucy Walther-Kral said that Davstar officials have not 
determined how its DriStar Incontinence Management System will be sold.But she 
added that the company is looking at distributing it through retail outlets 
along with selling it to nursing homes and home health care companies. 
</P>
<P>
 She also declined to say how much the device is expected to add to the 
company's bottom line, but pointed out that the potential market for the device 
is about $10.3 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1993, Davstar posted a loss of $5.9 million on annual sales of $3.9 
million, due in large part to research and development investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The DriStar, which can be plugged into electrical wall sockets or run on 
batteries, is about the size of a bread box and consists of a flexible hose 
that is connected to a small pump on one end and a specially designed feminine 
pad on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 The pump, which is normally run 24 hours a day, removes moisture from the pad, 
Walther-Kral said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted positively to the news. Davstar stock closed at $6.375 a 
share Wednesday on the American Stock Exchange, up $1.675 a share.

INJUNCTION GIVEN IN ALLEGED STOCK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has won a permanent injunction against 
10 defendants who allegedly ran a $1.6-million penny-stock fraud during the 
mid-1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramon D'Onofrio of Anaheim Hills and the others were accused by the SEC of 
running up the price of Kinesis Inc., a Kirkland, Wash., company that makes 
athletic shoes.The injunction prohibits the defendants from violating SEC laws. 
It also orders D'Onofrio to pay a $700,000 judgment.  
</P>
<P>
 The SEC alleged that D'Onofrio and the others drove the price of Kinesis stock 
up to $22 a share from $5 through a series of sham transactions.  
</P>
<P>
 The SEC said that D'Onofrio previously had been convicted four times of 
security fraud and had been enjoined five times by the SEC for violations of 
security laws.

BORROWERS OF THE '80S ARE BECOMING BARGAINERS OF THE '90S; CONSUMERS: A LITTLE 
KNOWN STATISTIC ECONOMISTS USE SHOWS PEOPLE ARE LOOKING MORE FOR LOW PRICES 
THAN PRESTIGE LABELS. THRIFT IS IN, AND THOSE WHO LIVE BEYOND THEIR MEANS ARE 
VIEWED AS FOOLISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CUNNIFF, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a traditional once-a-year holiday gathering of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it at a thrift shop," said the owner of a handsome sport jacket. He 
explained that he never bought anything at full price anymore, but you wondered 
if modesty was pride disguised. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this the same fellow who so conspicuously displayed his Guccis and his 
Jaguar in 1987? Who might have bragged about how much -- "Did price really 
matter?" -- not how little he paid for the sport jacket? 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate saleswoman spoke. "It's a problem," she said. "Everyone wants a 
bargain today, and they're not afraid to ask." She lamented the passing of the 
mid-1980s, when couples outbid each other for properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days when people dared to experiment with their money and their 
way of life, when something new meant something good, when people bought with 
abandon because they could always pay for it in a better tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not so certain now. Security dictates behavior. The future is as 
uncertain as the present, and those who live beyond their means are viewed as 
foolish. Thrift is in. If you're cautious you're prudent; you're with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed. People have hunkered down and are buying down. You can 
prove it by a little known statistic economists call the consumption deflator. 
It shows people are looking more for low prices than prestige labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Should you question statistical proof, as many do today, then let the big-name 
symbols such as Betty Crocker and the Marlboro man tell you about their battle 
with lower-priced generic brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent signs of economic strength, family budgets are tight. Spending 
has risen at the slowest rate since World War II. Savings rates have dwindled. 
By some estimates a third of households have no discretionary income -- nothing 
left after paying for basics. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence also shows a more cautious and responsible attitude about 
indebtedness. Although consumers borrowed more with their credit cards this 
past year than in 1992, overall installment debt remains substantially lower 
than its 1990 peak. Loan delinquencies, a sign of debt recklessness, are at the 
lowest level in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges is a picture of Americans feeling stress, regardless of what 
economists and government officials and their statistics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Official data do indeed show an expanding economy. Personal income, for 
example, rose 2.3% in the second quarter after declining 1.4% in the first. 
Inflation figures released earlier this month were tame. Interest rates, though 
slightly higher in recent weeks, remain quite low. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can the economy be up when so many people feel down? Has the American 
consumer changed fundamentally? 
</P>
<P>
 "Twaddle," says Fabian Linden, an economist at the Conference Board, a 
business research group that has studied consumer behavior for decades. 
Consumers just don't change quickly in fundamental ways, he says; they react 
rationally to the economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 By this reckoning, when the economy emphatically improves, you will see 
consumer behavior change in predictable ways. In Linden's view, the media 
obsession with how consumers might react to this or that event is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent Conference Board reading on the consumer mood showed a sharp 
rise in confidence during November. But Linden and other economists cautioned 
not to read too much into a one-month snapshot view. 
</P>
<P>
 Another longer-term Conference Board study shows disposable income has risen 
45% in the past two decades. It suggests living standards of the average 
American will basically double in slightly more than 35 years -- a single 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the same study also provides an explanation for consumer stress. 
It found that over the past 20 years, women accounted for 60% of the 
incremental increase in the U.S. labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Change in the family structure has ramifications across society," says 
Stephen J. Hoch, a professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in 
behavioral science. It takes better management of time, yes, and money too. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, unlike periods when the economy expands swiftly, good news today is 
bad news too. Low interest rates help debtors but hurt savers. Prices may be 
stable, but state and local taxes have jumped. The cost of health care, which 
everyone wants, has become an issue in every home. 
</P>
<P>
 These anomalies cast shadows of doubts on the performance of the economy. They 
create confusion and a cautious, not-now-but-later mood among consumers. But 
they're not the only causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also contributing is the greatest job insecurity of any postwar economic 
recovery; until recently, slow pay raises and falling real estate values; big 
debt hangovers from the 1980s; low or no savings. All are factors, and their 
restraining influence is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Less measurable is the impact of events less direct: Government deficits and 
the failure to contain them; a sense that business and jobs are changing in 
ways difficult to comprehend; violent crime; the quality of education. 
</P>
<P>
 Such items -- anyone can enlarge the list -- help produce contrasts in 
behavior between 1993 and a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadly and perhaps superficially, we were careless or exuberant in the 1980s 
and we are overly cautious in the '90s. In the mid-1980s we were confident in 
our economic direction, which was up; in the early 1990s we have our doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we try to make the most of it, harboring assets and putting our houses 
in order if we can, and smiling for the world to see, like the fellow at the 
party who no longer can afford a full-price sport coat, let alone a Jaguar.

PACIFIC PLANS FOUR PREMIERES; MUSIC: AMONG THE OFFERINGS IN COSTA MESA WILL BE 
A NEW ORCHESTRATION OF MUSSORGSKY'S 'A NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN' IN DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new orchestration of Mussorgsky's "A Night on Bald Mountain" will be one of 
four world premieres during the Pacific Symphony's 1994-95 season, announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The others will be the previously announced Vietnam War commemoration 
commissioned by the orchestra from Elliott Goldenthal, and two pieces by the 
orchestra's composer-in-residence, Frank Ticheli. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Bald Mountain" orchestration will be by clarinetist-composer Daniel 
Lochrie of the Nashville Symphony, completed as part of his doctoral studies at 
Ohio State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike more familiar orchestrations by Rimsky-Korsakov or Leopold Stokowski 
(or even a choral-orchestral version by Vissarion Shebalin), Lochrie's score -- 
according to Pacific music director Carl St.Clair -- attempts to be more 
faithful to Mussorgsky's own late piano-vocal score, which he intended to 
orchestrate but did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are actual note differences (from the other versions)," St.Clair said 
Wednesday at his home in Turtle Rock. "There's a devil's theme that is not 
present (in the other versions) and thousands of different changes. I think 
it's very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ticheli pieces will include a fanfare to open the season and a major work 
to be played in May. The fanfare will a "solemn" one, St.Clair said, in keeping 
with the seriousness of the opening program which includes Mozart's Requiem and 
James Hopkins' "Songs of Eternity." That piece, first done last year by the 
Pacific Chorale, was commissioned by a Santa Ana couple in memory of their 
26-year-old son who had been killed in a freeway accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people realize it," St.Clair said, "but in the last two seasons 
we have not done less than 17% contemporary American music. That would surprise 
even our subscribers. I don't count it by the number of pieces; I count it by 
the total minutes of music. And I'm very happy at the response. The audience is 
always talking about the new pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Soloists for the season will include violinists Nai-Yuan Hu and Robert 
McDuffie, and pianists Alain Lefevre, Seung-Un Ha and Horacio Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 Hu, first-prize winner in the 1985 Queen Elisabeth International Violin 
Competition in Belgium, will be playing with the Pacific for the first time. 
McDuffie played during the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre was the soloist last month for Corigliano's Piano Concerto, which he 
and the orchestra are recording for Koch International Classics. Ha played last 
summer during the orchestra's outdoor series at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. Guiterrez played with the orchestra in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guest conductors will include Maximiano Valdes, music director of the Buffalo 
Philharmonic since 1989, and George Cleve, who conducted the program with Ha at 
Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 All the announced concerts will take place at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa. The Thursday concerts, for the third consecutive 
year, will be broadcast live over KUSC-FM (91.5). 
</P>
<P>
 The season: 
</P>

ALMOST HOLLYWOOD...THEY'LL KILL FOR A CHANCE AT THE BIG TIME; . . . JUST ABOUT 
ANYTHING GOES IN THE QUEST FOR FOREIGN SALES; MOVIES: AT THIS YEAR'S AMERICAN 
FILM MARKET, INTERNATIONAL BUYERS AREN'T LOOKING FOR ART FILMS. THEY WANT -- 
AND FIND -- FLYING FISTS, NUDE WOMEN WITH GUNS, CAR CRASHES AND LOTS OF STUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While debate rages in America over the level of violence in entertainment 
programming, Hollywood continues to spew out a steady stream of graphic movies 
to the world, many that end up on video in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For months Hollywood has been under siege by the White House, the Justice 
Department and segments of the public to clean up its act, forcing TV networks 
to tone down the content of shows and movie studios to boost production of 
family films. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for the past week in sun-drenched Santa Monica, hundreds of international 
buyers are trekking to the Loews Hotel for this year's American Film Market, on 
the hunt for product to fill their theaters, video outlets and air waves in 
their respective nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The sellers at the market are not the major studios but by and large small, 
low-end independent product suppliers, who are hawking such action/erotic 
titles as "Teenage Catgirls in Heat," a wacky comedy from the people at Troma, 
Inc., Crown International's "Housewife From Hell," "Skinner," an exploitative 
"Silence of the Lambs" wanna-be directed by Ivan Nagy of Heidi Fleiss fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Look down any hallway at the Loews, enter any guest suite, survey any display 
at the AFM -- and the chances are good you'll see movie posters and slick 
brochures depicting actors brandishing guns. Show a seductive woman gripping a 
gun and you have the ultimate sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kronovet pops a videocassette into the VCR and invites a guest to watch 
the trailers from a trio of low-budget films his company has produced. It 
doesn't take long for the action to commence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fists fly. Guns fire. People fall down dead. A partially-nude woman gets 
sliced up the belly by a madman named Jack. Two lifeless women sit side by 
side, their blood-smeared necks slit from ear to ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe any of these films are violent just for violence's sake," 
Kronovet explains -- perhaps a little tongue-in-cheek -- over the sounds of 
women screaming and guns blazing in "Deadly Eyes," "L.A. Task Force" and "Blind 
Vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kronovet is president of Gun for Hire Films, a small production company that 
is selling its product to foreign buyers at AFM. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Gun for Hire Films, we have a moral in our stories. The moral is very 
simple. The good guy wins, the bad guy loses hard," he says in an interview at 
which he hands a guest a complimentary key chain with a dangling miniature 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are companies like Capella International, Miramax or Ciby 
2000 that offer quality films with A-list actors and directors at the AFM, but 
most buyers come to find gunplay and sex. For discerning buyers, they can 
purchase such higher-quality films as "Nell" with Jodie Foster from PolyGram 
Film International, Jack Nicholson in "The Crossing Guard" from Miramax and 
"Two Bits" with Al Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio from Capella. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are nine films for sale that were well-received at the 
Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether it's the promise of an action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, 
which Imperial Entertainment is pre-selling months before the untitled film is 
even shot, buyers know they aren't necessarily coming to AFM to purchase 
art-house pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Those film companies that have artsy dramas and comedies for sale, find that 
they just don't sell like hard action movies or erotic thrillers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogs Bark Blue," a family drama about two boys trying to work through the 
death of their father, proved to be a tough sell, according to Scott Wiseman, 
executive vice president of Falcon Arts & Entertainment. On the other hand, he 
has had success with "Hard Evidence," which he describes as "a 'Lethal Weapon' 
kind of action film -- car chases, explosions, gunshots." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiseman said foreign buyers rarely want to know about the plots of his movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some buyers from Brazil who came in and said they wanted erotic 
pictures with a story line, " Wiseman recalled with a laugh. "I looked at them 
and said, 'Yeah, one or the other, which one do you want? I got them both.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that censorship varies from country to country, some sellers shoot 
several versions of their films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Improper Conduct," a story of sexual harassment in the workplace from Everest 
Entertainment, was filmed in three versions: G-rated for American television, 
an R-rated version for late-night cable, and an even stronger version for video 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan would like a lot of sex but not violence and sex combined," said Jag 
Mundhra, president of Everest. "But many European markets want stronger films." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers from Eastern Europe, where communist governments once prevented 
gratuitous violence or erotic entertainment, now want both, AFM vendors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We distribute to Eastern Europe and they do not want films that are cut," 
said Arthur Schweitzer, president of Cinevest Entertainment Group. "They'll 
take gratuitous violence. . . . On the other side, we deal with Islamic 
republics and these countries, whether they be Malaysia or Pakistan or other 
countries, have strict censorship of gratuitous violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginka Andreeva, president of Multi Video Centre in Sofia, Bulgaria, said 
action and science fiction films are particularly popular in her country, and 
added that there is no restriction on violent content in films shown there. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to see them," she said of action films. "Personally, I prefer 
melodrama." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every country wants shoot-em-ups. Arni Samuelsson, a theater-owner from 
Reykjavik, said moviegoers in his native Iceland want to see the level of 
violence in films toned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are asking us if possibly we would not bring them this type of film 
anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it isn't the violence itself that attracts foreign buyers, 
filmmakers say, it's any action on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a chase film, there doesn't have to be violence and death," said 
Shauna Shapiro Jackson, executive vice president of Showcase Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The foreign buyers like stunts," Jackson said. "It's not necessarily how many 
people get killed in the movie. I tend to not pick up films that are too bloody 
because that film does tend to be a censorship problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Cinequanon Pictures International is featuring "Skinner," from Nagy, the 
ex-boyfriend of alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss who single-handledy 
scandalized Columbia Pictures last summer. Nagy even tossed a cocktail party 
the other night at Tatou in Beverly Hills, bringing along "Carlotta," who an 
aide to Nagy said was once one of Heidi's girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked the premise of "Skinner," the aide replied: "Basically, it's about a 
serial killer who, after murdering his victims -- all of whom are women -- he 
skins them and wears the skin as a trophy. It's a very dark version of 'Silence 
of the Lambs' with a Nagy twist to it. He made the film to exorcise the demons 
from his relationship with Heidi." 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma for some sellers at AFM is how do you compete with companies that 
are offering films filled with sex and violence? 
</P>
<P>
 One company that faced that dilemma was Live Entertainment, which has the 
foreign rights to a small-budget film called "The Beans of Egypt, Maine." The 
movie stars Martha Plimpton, Rutger Hauer and Kelly Lynch and is based on the 
critically praised novel of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 While the film will be released domestically under that title by I.R.S. Media, 
Live Entertainment has been marketing the film at AFM under the racier title 
"Forbidden Choices." 
</P>
<P>
 That has producer Rosilyn Heller upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like an exploitation movie, practically," Heller said. "We said (to 
Live), 'We've got such a unique title, why change it to something that is so 
totally forgettable?"' 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Live Entertainment said "Forbidden Choices" is only a 
working title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the picture is a commercial picture," she said. "Our goal is to 
market it in the best way possible. For this market, we decided this was the 
strongest way to market this picture. No final decision has been made on the 
release name of the title. This is simply how we are selling it."

SKATEGATE: AND NOW THE MOVIES; TELEVISION: NETWORKS RUSH TO CAPITALIZE ON NANCY 
AND TONYA. AND THERE MAY EVEN BE A FEATURE FILM DOWN THE ROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the grand tradition of quickie TV movie subjects such as "Lethal Lolita" 
Amy Fisher, cult leader David Koresh and alleged parent slayers Lyle and Erik 
Menendez, the Icewomen cometh. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, NBC and Fox are moving at triple-lutz speed in their plans for movies 
based on Olympic ice-skating silver medalist Nancy Kerrigan and rival Tonya 
Harding. Another producer is hoping to put together a feature film with 
Harding's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two of the television movies -- those at Fox and ABC -- are being 
rushed into production for broadcast during the May ratings sweeps, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It usually takes me more time to see a movie than I'll have to make this 
one," quipped Steve Tisch, producer of a Kerrigan-based film being made by 
Disney for ABC. He added, "ABC feels we should be competitive with the other 
two movies." 
</P>
<P>
 While the ABC project focuses specifically on Kerrigan and will involve her in 
the production, the Fox and NBC efforts will center on the Kerrigan-Harding 
rivalry and will be written largely from newspaper reports and public records. 
The fourth project would tell Harding's story, and is contingent on her 
agreeing to sell rights to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks and producers said that public interest in the two ice skaters is 
far from the cooling-down stage, even though their highly anticipated showdown 
at the Winter Olympics in Norway ended last Friday. In that competition, which 
drew some of the largest audiences in TV history, Kerrigan won the silver while 
Harding finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripts for the three television films are being written at break-neck speed, 
even though Harding's fate is uncertain and Kerrigan's post-Olympic behavior 
has come in for some criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding continues to be investigated by law-enforcement officials for her 
possible involvement in the Jan. 6 assault on Kerrigan. And the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. has scheduled a disciplinary hearing for March 10 in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., to determine whether Harding can remain a member of the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kerrigan, who signed an estimated $2-million deal with the Walt 
Disney Co. for a TV movie, a prime-time special, a book and appearances at 
Disney theme parks, became the target of some unwanted publicity following 
comments she made during last weekend's appearance at a Disney World parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In video taped by KNBC-TV Channel 4 in Los Angeles, Kerrigan was heard to say, 
"This is so corny. This is so dumb. This is the most corny thing I've ever 
done." The footage was aired on CNBC's "Tom Snyder," NBC's "Late Night With 
Conan O'Brien" and NBC's "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials declined to comment on Kerrigan's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch said that the Kerrigan movie for ABC "will deal with her as she prepares 
for the Olympics. I'm not sure where it's going to end, but it will probably 
end very close to her winning the medal." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the film would not focus too closely on the Kerrigan assault: 
"It will be dealt with, but that's not the story we're trying to tell. It's a 
family movie. There'll be nothing scandalous about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was interviewing actors and actresses for the movie this week, and 
was under no pressure from the network to cast a known actress as Kerrigan. 
Kerrigan will be doing her own skating in the film, and will re-create routines 
from a number of competitions, Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also hoping that he would be able to use CBS footage from the Olympics. 
But CBS officials said they will not allow any of their tape to be shown by 
anyone other than them. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC officials said their film about Harding and Kerrigan is not targeted at 
this point for the May sweeps. It is being written by Phil Penningroth, the 
writer of NBC's "Amy Fisher: My Story," using material in the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox officials declined to comment on their film. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Zev Braun said he finds Harding the more fascinating movie subject of 
the two skaters and is negotiating with her representatives for the rights to 
make a movie either for TV or theatrical release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy is not interesting," he said. "She's an interior person. She's 
inarticulate and inexpressive. As far as personalities go, Tonya represents the 
underclass of America. What she has gone through has captured the imagination 
of many of us. She's been victimized by her mother, her husband, and still 
she's one of the greatest skaters of our time."

ROSEANNE'S KISS: AND NOW THE AFTERMATH; TELEVISION: ABC REPORTS FAVORABLE 
REACTION, WITH ONLY TWO STATIONS IN SMALL MARKETS REFUSING TO CARRY THE 
EPISODE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The controversial kiss between Roseanne Arnold and Mariel Hemingway came off 
Tuesday night, apparently without much of a kiss-off from viewers, advertisers 
or ABC stations. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC officials said Wednesday morning that they had received about 100 calls at 
their New York headquarters regarding the "Roseanne" episode, broadcast the 
night before, in which Roseanne Conner (Arnold) was kissed in a gay bar by a 
lesbian stripper played by Hemingway. About 75% of the calls expressed a 
favorable reaction, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Roseanne" executive producer Tom Arnold said that some advertisers 
had dropped out of the episode, ABC said the commercial time was fully sold. 
And only two of the network's 225 affiliated stations declined to carry the 
episode, ABC said. The network refused to identify them except to say they were 
not in the 150 largest markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the calls we got from viewers found the show funny and wondered what 
all the fuss was about," said Stephen Battaglio, director of media relations 
for ABC. "The reaction showed that 'Roseanne' has a loyal audience that has 
accepted the fact that the show will take on controversial subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 According to ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co., the show was seen in about 
19.9 million homes and attracted 30% of the available audience. That was 
slightly higher than what "Roseanne" has been averaging for the season, and 
easily beat the other networks. CBS' three-hour Grammy Awards telecast averaged 
about 15.2 million households, garnering its second-lowest rating ever (ahead 
of only 1989). 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's "Roseanne" episode had been the target of a heated struggle for 
weeks between network executives and the show's executive producers, Roseanne 
and Tom Arnold. The Arnolds had complained that ABC initially refused to show 
the kiss because executives felt it was inappropriate for a prime-time 
situation comedy that would be seen by children. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC had declined official comment about whether the kiss would be shown, but 
wound up airing the episode with a disclaimer advising parental discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday afternoon, Tom Arnold said the network had just informed him that 
the show would air unedited. "The folks at ABC really went to bat for us with 
the corporate people who didn't want to air the episode, and I will never 
forget them for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold appeared Tuesday night at a West Hollywood benefit for the Gay & 
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/L.A., which had lobbied the network to show 
the kiss unedited. The overflow crowd at the Love Lounge watched the episode 
and whooped loudly at the physical encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Berg and Stan Zimmerman, who wrote the episode and helped put together the 
benefit, said they were pleased with the way the furor ended and with the 
crowd's response. "We're surprised it caused as much ruckus as it did, but 
we're glad it's over," Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad it aired," said Lee Werbel, executive director of the local 
GLAAD chapter. "I just don't see what the big deal was about. It was never a 
show about the kiss. It was a show about Roseanne's reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 In the episode, Roseanne was caught off guard when she realized that Sharon, 
the lover of her other gay friend, Nancy (Sandra Bernhard), had taken a real 
liking to her. As the two sat alone at a table, Sharon told her that they ought 
to hang out more often together, then kissed her tenderly for about five 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Rakolta, head of Americans for Responsible TV, which has criticized 
programs dealing with sexual matters, said Wednesday that the kiss was meant to 
"spike ratings and was really gratuitous," but added that she had no specific 
objection to it. "I just think it was on too early, and it was not something 
that children should see." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Westenhoeser, a lesbian comic, also took issue with the episode -- but 
for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes us look predatory," she said. "There's a bar full of lesbian women, 
but yet Mariel Hemingway goes for the only straight woman in the place. I don't 
get it."

SANTA BARBARA FILM FEST NO LONGER A MODEST AFFAIR; MOVIES: STARTING FRIDAY, THE 
CITY WILL PLAY HOST TO NINE WORLD PREMIERES, NEARLY 100 FILMS AND ABOUT 25,000 
FILMGOERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In 1986, John G. Thomas volunteered for the first Santa Barbara Film Festival, 
a relatively modest four-day affair that met with some success. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, eight years later, his film "Healer" opens the ninth annual 
festival, a 100-film, 10-day event with nine world premieres expected to 
attract 25,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, for one, couldn't be happier. "Being the opening night is a wonderful 
thing for us," said the 46-year-old director, who hopes to get his film, which 
examines themes of aging through the eyes of two paramedics, picked up for 
distribution. "Hollywood comes up there (and) the Santa Barbara Festival is 
very important because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's program will include sections titled "Australian Horizons," "Best 
of the British," "Contemporary Chinese Cinema," "El Cine en Espanol," "Made in 
Canada" and "U.S. Independents," as well as categories for world cinema, 
documentaries and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 To close the festival on March 13, festival artistic director Phyllis de 
Picciotto chose Gramercy's "Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould," a 
Canadian film consisting of 32 vignettes about the iconoclast pianist that won 
four Canadian Genie Awards. Other highlights of the festival include world 
premieres for: ". . .and the earth did not swallow him," a film about the 
experiences of Chicano migrant workers based on the book by Tomas Rivera; 
"Chuppa: The Wedding Canopy," a film about Holocaust survivors who finally have 
a Jewish wedding; "Latin Legends," a documentary about Latino professional 
boxers featuring Edward James Olmos; and "Living With. . . ," a documentary 
about a Santa Barbara home for people with AIDS. The festival will also pay 
special homage to actress Alfre Woodard and early screen star Buddy Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become relatively easy to look good," said de Picciotto. "I look for 
honesty, I look for fun, I look for entertainment, I look for a fresh 
perspective." She's especially excited about " . . . and the earth did not 
swallow him" and "Latin Legends," two "landmark films of Hispanic content." 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian filmmaker Aaron Kim Johnston is giving his film, "For the Moment," 
its U.S. premiere at the festival. He first came to Santa Barbara in 1991, 
looking for distribution for his film "The Last Winter." He didn't find it, but 
he's coming back in March to look for distribution for his new film, which 
tells the story of a World War II romance in Canada between an Australian pilot 
and a young Manitoba woman. He also finds Santa Barbara to be "an acid test for 
American sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the main goal of the city is to attract tourists. Besides locals, 
the festival attracts a mix of California weekenders, Los Angeles industry 
types and vacationers looking to take advantage of the festival and Santa 
Barbara's weather and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The city promotes the festival as the ideal winter getaway, and even 
filmmakers aren't immune to the appeal. Johnston added that, "when you live in 
Winnipeg, Santa Barbara is a very attractive place to go in March." 
</P>
<P>
 * For a complete screening schedule or more information, call the film 
festival hot line: (805) 689-INFO. Festival headquarters will be at the 
Graphics Gallery, at 1220 State St., Santa Barbara, and will be open 1 to 6 
p.m. daily during the festival.

CITY HALL NEWS; MAYORS WILL TRY TO FILL AIR QUALITY BOARD OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayors from throughout the San Gabriel Valley and beyond meet today to try to 
fill an opening on the Southland's air quality board after a stalemate that has 
left the area without representation for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates for the position are from the San Gabriel Valley, which 
has the worst air pollution problems in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities have tried three times since November to elect a replacement for 
Henry Morgan, who was the area's representative on the 12-member South Coast 
Air Quality Management District Board. Morgan was recalled from the Covina City 
Council in November and had to vacate his AQMD seat Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 But no candidate has received the necessary support: votes from two-thirds of 
the 63 cities involved, with at least two-thirds of the population. That 
translates into 42 cities with a collective population of at least 2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the stalemate, the interests of the 63 cities went 
unrepresented last month, when the board voted to reject a plan to regulate 
toxic industrial air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has left us without representation," said Sierra Madre Mayor Clem L. 
Bartolai. "We've had vote after vote. It's so frustrating. The two-thirds 
criteria is impossible with cities switching sides, and others not even 
appearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the mayors will be voting in Alhambra on whether the seat should go to 
La Canada Flintridge Councilwoman Joan C. Feehan, La Puente Councilman Louis R. 
Perez or Pomona Councilwoman Nell Soto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope my candidacy can break the deadlock," said Feehan, 62, an eight-year 
councilwoman who has served on a AQMD policy committee and recently joined the 
race with the backing of Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last three months, Soto, 67, and Azusa Councilwoman Cristina 
Cruz-Madrid, 44, have competed for the seat. Soto is seen as sympathetic to 
industry concerns, while Madrid is seen as an environmentalists' candidate who 
has taken on the region's quarries over air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a vote in late January, Madrid received the support of 19 cities, while 
Soto was backed by 33, with 11 cities absent. At that point, the mayors decided 
to open up the election to other candidates, and Feehan and Perez, both seen as 
moderates, joined the race. Meanwhile, Madrid backed out, saying she would 
support whoever among Soto's opponents seems to have the most votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find some new blood. Someone who won't represent just industry's 
(lobbyists)," said Madrid, who believes her candidacy was scuttled by firms 
facing pollution regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto -- who is the target of a recall petition in her hometown -- said 
environmentalists and business leaders need to compromise on air quality 
issues. "The environment ought to be protected, but we shouldn't sacrifice 
business for it," she said.

SUSPECT HELD, FOUR SOUGHT IN COVINA KIDNAPING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego man was arrested at a Covina apartment complex Monday after a 
kidnap victim escaped and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Cortez Rodriguez, 27, was stopped by Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department deputies as he walked away from the victim's apartment in the Club 
Pacifica complex at 21042 E. Arrow Highway about 6:30 p.m., Deputy Diane Hecht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five men kidnaped the victim, a 38-year-old Colombian man who asked that his 
name be withheld, as he walked to his van about 8 a.m. that day, Hecht said. 
Four men forced the victim into his van and drove off while Rodriguez allegedly 
held the victim's wife and three children hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 After driving around for several hours, the victim pulled over in Huntington 
Park and managed to escape.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim dialed 911 to report the hostage situation, and deputies from the 
Walnut sheriff's substation surrounded the apartment and captured Rodriguez. No 
one was hurt, Hecht said. The four kidnapers in the van are still at large.

CONDO RESIDENTS SEEK $7.7 MILLION FROM DEVELOPER; COURTS: SUIT ALLEGES THAT THE 
BUILDING IS POORLY CONSTRUCTED, NOISY AND LEAKS WHEN IT RAINS. DEFENSE CONCEDES 
SOME FLAWS BUT SAYS OWNERS EXPECTED TOO MUCH.

<P>
 At first David Shultz was merely annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 When his upstairs neighbor walked around, the pots in his kitchen rattled and 
it sounded as though she might drop through the ceiling. He could even hear her 
use the facilities more clearly than he cared to. Aggravating, but not 
alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about 1 1/2 years ago, water laden with construction chemicals seeped 
through the garage roof onto his wife's car, ruining the paint job. Not long 
after, parquet floors in Shultz's ground-level condominium separated and 
swelled up to four inches. One day he discovered that sections of bathroom 
flooring did not have the materials required to prevent fire from spreading 
between units. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Shultz was unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shultz, a real estate broker and property manager who moved into the 
Pasadena condominium complex in late 1989, wasn't the only one at 515 S. Orange 
Grove Blvd. with such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of 16 owners who paid $600,000 to $1 million for their condos and 
who have taken their case to Pasadena Superior Court. They are seeking $7.7 
million in damages from Orange Grove Partners, a corporation established by 
developer Victor Illig and his wife, Evangeline, to build and market the units. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense concedes that the building has needed repeated repairs, but says 
the work sought by homeowners is excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Judson, homeowners association president, testified during the trial that 
he has had to replace his entire living room, dining room and den ceilings 
because of water damage. A section of his dining room is cracking again and 
Judson believes it too will cave in. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Moule, 82, said persistent leaks during rainy seasons have forced her 
to place buckets in strategic locations to catch dripping water, and to cover 
her carpet with plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, residents in seven of the 16 units have reported significant water 
leaks. Almost uniformly, residents complain about excessive noise and faulty 
air-conditioning and heating systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Moule said her daily routine consists of walking in stocking feet, brushing 
her teeth in the guest bedroom, flushing toilets only during the day and using 
her oven to warm the kitchen in the morning -- all so she won't disturb her 
neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the residents are elderly people who moved into the condos from large 
single-family homes, seeking a simpler life that still afforded a measure of 
luxury. Shultz, 57, is the youngest homeowner. Five widows in their 70s and 80s 
live in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really thought we were going to get the ultimate," said Ray Judson, 67, a 
civil engineer. Instead, he insists, they got "nothing but problems. Nothing 
but problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association filed a suit in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson said he and the other homeowners, who have spent more than $500,000 on 
the suit, originally just hoped to have the nagging problems end. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare the suit, residents hired architectural, structural and mechanical 
engineers to root out evidence that their problems were not being corrected. 
According to the homeowners, the experts found worse -- poor engineering and 
shoddy construction. The result, they say, is an unsafe building. "That's when 
this thing suddenly escalated," Judson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that many of the 150 steel tie-downs, which are supposed to 
help fasten the building from the roof to the foundation, are missing or were 
installed improperly. Homeowners also complain that the complex's walls were 
not assembled according to seismic specifications, and could collapse in a 
large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illigs declined to discuss the lawsuit, but their lawyer, Bruce Gridley, 
agreed that the building is not watertight and that dripping and buckling 
plagued several homeowners. Gridley maintains, however, that leaks were being 
repaired right up until the lawsuit was filed, when they were halted at the 
homeowners' request. 
</P>
<P>
 Gridley denies the building is unsafe and said that homeowners' structural 
complaints, such as missing steel tie-downs, are misleading. He said that as is 
typically the case, the condominium's builders anticipated this type of 
construction problem and compensated by installing more than are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the building's structural components meet safety requirements, 
Gridley added: "When a building is not performing structurally, you know it. 
The walls are cracked, the flat surfaces would be sagging, and the walls would 
be leaning. Even after the recent earthquake that isn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gridley, the trial was triggered more out of the homeowners' 
disillusionment with living in the close quarters of a condo complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these people have been disappointed because I don't think they've 
fully understood what that meant," Gridley said.

YOUTH BOXING CLUB IS ON THE ROPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its run-down warehouse where sunlight can't pierce the grimy windows, an 
Alhambra boxing club has become a place where youths who are struggling to stay 
out of trouble learn not only about jabbing but also about self-esteem and 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the nonprofit club, which also sponsors a 10-week Toastmasters public 
speaking program for youths, is fighting to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where next month's rent will come from," said Antonia Tellez, 
47. She and her husband, Rudy, a 47-year-old former boxing manager, opened the 
club in July, 1991, with $3,000 of their own money and donations. It offers 
boxing instruction and a safe place to go for youths who might otherwise end up 
in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds began to dry up in December when the city stopped paying the $1,100 
monthly rent on the club's South Palm Avenue warehouse. The city had agreed to 
provide the first year's rent at the site, the club's third home in three 
years. A $2,500 grant from Pacific Bell was exhausted last month, leaving the 
club with $500 a month from the county probation service to pay the rent and 
bills.  
</P>
<P>
 Youths at the club say they probably will be on the streets and involved in 
gangs and tagging without it. The club name was even changed recently from the 
Alhambra Youth Boxing Club to the West San Gabriel Youth Athletic Club to 
attract sponsors wary of boxing's connotations of violence , but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city officials praise their efforts, the Tellezes say they have been 
offered nothing more than a loan this year. City officials say they have 
already paid $11,000 in rent and cannot continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The club started with more than 250 youngsters. But today, after relocating 
twice to smaller facilities, the club's membership is down to 109. 
</P>
<P>
 It began in a vacant warehouse on South Raymond Avenue. It then moved to 
another warehouse owned by Southern California Edison Co. on Marengo Avenue. 
Edison later sold the property and the club moved again in January, 1993.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; SCHOOL OFFICIAL TO LEAVE FOR NEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A school district administrator demoted last year for concealing the removal 
of a special-education department computer will become superintendent of an 
Imperial County school district this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Klentschy, 49, administrator of elementary instruction, told the 
Pasadena school board last week that his goal had always been to become a 
superintendent for a school district.He will assume the top educator position 
in the El Centro School District, next to the Mexian border, on March 14, 
almost a year after he was demoted from associate superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The demotion came after the school district discovered he had helped conceal 
the removal of the computer by then district security chief Charles Parcell to 
his department. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pasadena police, Klentschy authorized moving the computer to the 
security office. However, after special-education workers discovered the 
computer missing, Klentschy reportedly supported the theory it had been stolen. 
As a result, Klentschy's annually salary was cut from $86,900 to just over 
$77,000. He also forfeited $15,000 in vacation pay.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SAN DIMAS; PLAN CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT AT BONELLI 
PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recently completed draft master plan for Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park 
calls for expanding Raging Waters amusement park and adding a camping area and 
an indoor recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for the 2,000-acre park, which has been criticized as too 
development-intensive by a local group called Coalition to Preserve Bonelli 
Park, allows the popular water slide amusement park to build nine acres of 
rides on an existing parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under the proposed master plan, Raging Waters would develop five acres 
into a retail village and would build a new park entryway. It would pave 
several dirt parking lots in Bonelli Park and add about 12 acres of parking 
with 1,400 spaces. That would bring the total to 4,500 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to new hiking and biking trails, the draft master plan calls for 
14 more acres of campground -- including tents, cabin tents and RV spaces -- 
and construction of a 10,000-square-foot multipurpose center. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental studies on the proposed master plan are scheduled to begin soon. 
Members of the park advisory committee expect those studies and a final draft 
of the master plan to be sent to the County Board of Supervisors this fall for 
consideration.

<P>
 More than 3,000 people in the San Gabriel Valley area participated last week 
in World Vision's annual "30-Hour Famine," an international hunger education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 In a symbolic gesture, groups from Pasadena Covenant Church and Duarte High 
School fasted for 30 hours Friday and Saturday and accepted pledge 
contributions for each hour they went without food. Last year, a million 
teen-agers worldwide raised more than $15 million for hunger programs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fast, some groups arranged sleep-overs with hunger education 
programs or with food service at homeless shelters.

 When the Rev. Richard J. Anderson arrived at Sierra Madre Congregational 
Church the morning of Jan. 17, he entered the 66-year-old sanctuary to find 
fallen plaster and damaged stained-glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
 He was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Anderson has learned to expect the worst from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the church put off expansion plans when the Whittier Narrows quake 
damaged plaster and concrete. The plans were back on again three years ago, but 
the Sierra Madre quake severely damaged the bell tower and choir room. Repairs 
cost $350,000; the church postponed expansion again. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation was about to again submit pledges on the $2.3-million 
expansion and renovation project when the Northridge quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Whittier Narrows quake, church members pledged the funds needed to 
repair the damage and to retrofit the church, a $140,000 project that was 
completed eight months before the 1991 quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long history of earthquake-related damage," Anderson said. "This is 
really not something new for us." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the pledge drive is proceeding.

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; AVALANCHE POTENTIAL NOT JUST A SNOW JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the time of year that U.S. Forest Service ranger George Duffy looks at 
the behavior of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 He digs into snowpacks to check the layering. He whacks off a column of snow 
to see how easily it shears. He examines snow crystals under a magnifying glass 
to check for strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy and other rangers are watching for avalanche dangers in the Angeles 
National Forest, especially in the danger times between storms. So far, rangers 
say the chances of major slides are minimal, and they are not aware of any snow 
avalanches in the forest's main areas. But they are watching steep slopes in 
the Mt. Baldy area and other popular spots, ready to post warning signs if 
treacherous conditions exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a pile of white stuff on the ground," Duffy warned. "It's 
always getting stronger or weaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Duffy said, people forget the dangers when they see the soft, pretty 
snow. In fact, every year in the forest there are two or three snow-related 
fatalities and about 100 injuries in incidents including falls and slides, 
Duffy said. Two skiers died in an avalanche on the back side of Mt. Baldy in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem snow includes soft powder atop an old, hard layer; in that case, an 
avalanche can be triggered by the weight of the new snow itself or by a skier 
or sledder who puts extra weight on the snow pack "and away it goes," said Tom 
Spencer, the forest's district recreation officer. "Sometimes, it's just 
hanging there by a hair trigger, waiting to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow visitors should avoid steep slopes, especially in areas with no plant 
growth to secure the snowpack in place. Danger signs include small balls of 
snow rolling down a slope, an indication that the snow is unstable, Duffy said. 
Also, he said, your boot should make a clean indentation in the snow. If powder 
falls into your footprint, that's a sign of loose snow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sudden weather changes are also potentially hazardous, Duffy warned. For 
instance, someone could sled safely all morning and then take a lunch break 
during a subtle weather change in which the sun drops over a ridge and casts a 
shadow over the slope. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as it's in shadow, bingo, it's going to start breaking up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 People should not assume that rangers will post warning signs at all dangerous 
spots within the 694,000-acre forest, he said. And they should keep their 
jackets zipped and hats and mittens on as insulation in case of an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not discouraging people from coming to the snow after a snowfall," 
Duffy said. "The thing you have to do is stay away from steep, open slopes."

TOPICS / TRANSPORTATION; HOUSE PANEL TO LOOK AT 710 PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A House subcommittee will conduct a hearing Tuesday on the proposal to extend 
the Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710) through South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Subcommittee on Surface Transportation will listen to opponents and 
proponents of the project as part of a day of hearings on California 
transportation projects.Funding for the 6.2-mile extension would need to pass 
through the subcommittee before the project could be built. South Pasadena 
officials said the hearing was called after they shared their concerns about 
the project with Rep. Nick Rahall II (D-West Virginia), chairman of the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, the California Transportation Commission has delayed a final 
decision on the freeway extension until April 26 or 27, said Pete Hathaway, 
commission chief deputy director. The state commission will hear a final 
presentation from staff on the route this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Highway Administration, which would provide 85% of the project's 
funding, will make its decision on the freeway in May after the state 
commission makes its final determination. Congress would still need to approve 
the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park) has introduced a bill to remove 
a legal roadblock to the route. The bill would allow Caltrans to place the 710 
through South Pasadena without the usual agreement of the city. Last year, a 
Sacramento judge ruled a similar 1982 law authored by Martinez's father -- Rep. 
Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), then a state assemblyman -- had lapsed. 
Caltrans has appealed the decision.

 Representing its biggest order ever from the U.S. Postal Service, 
Pasadena-based Avery Dennison Corp. has won a $14-million contract to produce 
more than a billion self-adhesive stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year contract calls for Avery Dennison to produce up to 2 billion 
self-adhesive stamps per year. Production at the company's Clinton, S.C., 
production facility will begin in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery Dennison filled a Postal Service order for the world's first 
self-adhesive Christmas stamp in 1974. The company, one of the nation's largest 
producers of self-adhesive labels and other office products, stands to win big 
if the Postal Service decides to switch to mostly self-adhesive stamps rather 
than water-activated ones.

COVER STORY; ACCURATE TO A FAULT; SEISMOLOGY: SCIENTISTS ARE SLOWLY UNRAVELING 
THE COMPLICATED PUZZLE OF QUAKE ACTIVITY IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. THEIR 
HIGH-TECH TOOLS MIGHT SHOW WHICH SYSTEMS TO FOCUS ON.

 For decades, the San Gabriel Valley has been home to much of the nation's 
earthquake re search. And although the 6.8 Northridge temblor caused only 
modest damage locally, its deadly upward punch refocused attention on the 
theory that serious seismic activity is continuing in the Los Angeles Basin -- 
much of it increasingly centered in or near the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past seven years, four of six earthquakes in the basin registering 
5.0 or larger were centered in the San Gabriel Valley or nearby Upland, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone from about zero activity to a lot of activity," said Richard 
Morton, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey at UC Riverside. "That's 
what's really troublesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists and seismologists sprang into action when the Jan. 17 temblor 
struck Northridge, killing at least 57 people causing more than $20 billion in 
damage. Since then, they have busied themselves in the San Fernando Valley, 
setting up portable seismographs, measuring ground movement and examining 
cracks in the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Their findings about the Northridge quake could affect how scientists view the 
faults and earthquake activity 20 miles to the east in the San Gabriel Valley. 
The research "might change our picture of how these (San Gabriel Valley) faults 
interact together," said Lucile M. Jones, a U.S. Geological Survey 
seismologist. "It might tell us which are more important than others." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have been working for years to unravel the horrendously complicated 
puzzle of faults in the San Gabriel Valley and much of the Los Angeles Basin. 
The valley's fault system is far more complicated than the notorious San 
Andreas fault zone just over the mountains to the east, seismologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not clear how the pieces fit together," said Jones, the seismologist 
well-known to local television viewers for her savvy translations of what all 
the shaking means. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pieces include active faults like the 60-mile-long Sierra Madre, 
considered the biggest threat in the valley capable of generating a 
7.5-magnitude shock. Shorter, less-threatening faults such as the Raymond, 
Cucamonga, Whittier, Eagle Rock, San Jose and Clamshell Saw Pit also thread 
through the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the issue are faults such as the 50-million-year-old San Gabriel 
Fault. The San Andreas of its day, the only energy the San Gabriel generates 
now is controversy. Scientists debate whether movement 11,000 years ago on this 
fault means it still should be considered active, Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the activity scale is one of the more recently discovered 
faults, the Elysian Park Fold and Thrust Belt. A thrust occurs when one side of 
a slanting fault moves closer to its parallel side. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elysian Park belt, skirting the San Gabriel Valley's southwestern edge, 
was discovered when it emerged as the prime suspect in the Whittier Narrows 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the giant lines of these faults are webs of smaller faults, not 
significant enough to even warrant names. 
</P>
<P>
 Buried and unseen faults become known, as did the Northridge fault and the 
Elysian Park belt, only when an earthquake shakes the earth, Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Northridge fault, the Elysian Park Fold and Thrust Belt is a blind 
thrust, meaning the fault line cannot be seen on the surface. Small hills on 
the surface may give some idea of the existence of blind thrusts underneath, 
but because their location cannot be pinpointed, scientists may have no 
knowledge of these faults until an earthquake hits. With the same seismic 
energy as other faults, these may not be more dangerous but do carry the added 
punch of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "These buried systems are very important criteria," Jones said. "We can have a 
6.6 anywhere in Los Angeles. . . . You can understand them, but basically you 
can't get the extent of them until an earthquake happens." 
</P>
<P>
 And earthquakes are always happening. Usually their magnitude registers below 
3, the level at which seismologists begin studying quakes as major seismic 
events. From 1900 to 1920, seismologists saw little need to study the Los 
Angeles Basin, which enjoyed relative seismic quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the following two decades -- 1920 to 1940 -- saw a cluster of temblors. 
Big quakes hit the southern end of the county, including a 6.4-magnitude tremor 
in Long Beach in 1933. Residents as far north as Monterey Park still recall 
pianos rolling out their back doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then followed 30 more years of quiet, until a 5.2 quake rumbled through the 
San Gabriel Mountains in 1970. The temblor was noted mainly by scientists 
because of its remote location on Lytle Creek. But the following year, nearly 
everyone took notice when the 6.4-magnitude Sylmar quake killed 58 people and 
caused $511 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only quake this century to rupture the surface of the Los Angeles 
Basin, a rare event because earthquake fissures typically occur one to 12 miles 
below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the cluster continued through the 1970s and 1980s. Quakes in the 
San Gabriel Valley or nearby included tremors in 1987 in Whittier Narrows, 1988 
in Pasadena, 1990 in Upland, 1991 in Sierra Madre and this year in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But what it means, no one knows. Are we at the beginning, middle or end of a 
cycle? "Only history will tell," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sierra Madre Fault is the biggest danger locally, Jones said she 
cannot predict when it might strike the San Gabriel Valley, except to say a 5.0 
quake is expected in the next 200 years. The problem, she said, is that society 
wants earthquake hazard information on a human time scale measured in years, 
instead of a geologic one measured in eons. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing the valley has in its favor, and that makes it unusual in the Los 
Angeles Basin, is the relatively solid geology, Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bedrock of the San Gabriel Mountains -- except for the lower, newer rock 
of the hills near Glendora -- provides a stable base during earthquakes, Morton 
said. In the valley floor, deep water tables -- below 35 feet -- provide safety 
against liquefaction, the movement of waterlogged soil that plagued Santa 
Monica in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley has long been the center of earthquake research in the 
United States, dating from 1928, when Caltech established a seismology lab in 
Pasadena. In the 1930s, Caltech Prof. Charles F. Richter developed a scale of 
measuring earthquakes that made his last name a household word. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, a group of Caltech scientists, using the name Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, received a $5-million Army grant for rocket research. JPL went on 
to become an internationally known military and space research lab, entering 
seismic research with satellites in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, the U.S. Geological Survey affiliated with Caltech, now 
recognized as one of the world's premier quake labs. 
</P>
<P>
 And the effort to understand San Gabriel Valley's faults is always under way, 
using a variety of methods: Satellite data 
</P>
<P>
 A constellation of 24 Defense Department satellites -- circling the globe and 
sending data back to 45 portable receivers worldwide -- yields information 
about the creep of tectonic plates, noting movement as little as a quarter of 
an inch. The receivers, placed at various sites at yearly intervals, record 
whether the ground has moved since the last placement. 
</P>
<P>
 Based since the 1980s at JPL, the program received a recent boost of $63,000 
from a National Science Foundation grant. It enabled Gregory A. Lyzenga, a 
geophysicist at Harvey Mudd College, to add two receivers to the four in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the laptop computer-size receivers and one-foot-diameter antennas, 
Lyzenga and students from the Claremont Colleges last fall roamed the 
mountaintops and valleys in San Gabriel Valley. They busied themselves placing 
the receivers in various locations so that the satellites could retrieve the 
data and compare it for movement against data from the same spot recorded a 
year ago. When the Northridge quake struck, they were sent scrambling again for 
aftershock data to measure ground movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit of a strange bird," said Lyzenga, a college undergraduate 
teacher suddenly plunged into the world of research science to rub arms with 
scientists armed with doctorates far removed from the classroom. "This is a 
very modern development. Literally three to five years ago it would have been 
unthinkable." Trenching 
</P>
<P>
 Digging into the first five to 20 feet of earth, scientists measure rock 
displacements and deduce the movement and magnitude of old quakes. They can 
pinpoint the era of these older quakes using another technology: radiocarbon 
dating of organic debris captured in rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Through radiocarbon dating, Caltech geologist Kerry Sieh and others analyzed 
the Raymond Fault in the San Gabriel Valley and the San Andreas Fault, both 
near Wrightwood on the north side of the San Gabriels and 20 miles north into 
the desert. In one spot, he gathered a history of 12 earthquakes in the last 
1,800 years, one of the more complete records available. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Wrightwood, evidence of an 1812 tremor and others yielded clues to 
earthquake patterns. Some major quakes did not seem to occur at both locations, 
even though they were separated by a mere 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sieh's trenching also led him to conclude that the southernmost end of the San 
Andreas Fault, between Indio and the Salton Sea, is the most likely area to 
next generate an earthquake. Explosives 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning this fall, scientists from the Southern California Earthquake Center 
at USC and the U.S. Geological Survey will set off 60 small blasts at least 50 
feet underground from Seal Beach through the San Gabriel Valley to the Mojave 
Desert. The blasts equal a magnitude 2.5 earthquake, tremors that occur at the 
rate of 40 to 50 on a normal day in Southern California, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosions are usually placed in spots perpendicular to fault lines to 
give the best readings and to allow differences in the rock to be easily 
discerned, said Jim Mori of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The northeast route followed by the blasts will roughly parallel the San 
Gabriel River, with up to 10 explosions set off in the valley, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using ammonium nitrate to create gentle shock waves, scientists will measure 
wave travel speeds to reveal the underlying geologic structure -- the 
geological equivalent of a human X-ray. The speed at which the waves bounce off 
underlying rock and travel back to the surface allows scientists to determine 
what sort of rock and soil lies underneath. Mathematically, Mori said, the 
information gives a detailed picture of the fault location and the geologic 
structure. Seismic networking 
</P>
<P>
 Located at Caltech for the past three years, a computerized system stores 
Southern California quake facts culled from 220 sites. Small sensors the size 
of a soup can, with accompanying electronic equipment, are piled in garbage 
can-size barrels. These barrels are scattered 10 to 15 miles apart to allow 
scientists to carpet the area and get overall readings for the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of sites are located in the flats of the San Gabriel Valley; another 
20 are in the San Gabriel Mountains, where the bedrock gives better readings, 
Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to hide them," he said, adding that solar panels sometimes used to 
power the equipment are very often hit by bullets from target shooters or are 
pulled off by thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitive seismographs, capable of recording zero-magnitude quakes -- that is, 
the very smallest quakes -- are set up to collect data. After major shocks 
measuring magnitude 5 or better, additional portable seismographs are hustled 
out to even more sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, called a "jukebox" by some scientists, enables researchers to 
retrieve data via computer and avoid traveling to Pasadena to spend weeks 
reading through computer tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and her husband, Egill Hauksson of Caltech's seismology lab, are network 
experts. Together or with other scientists, the couple have written on most 
major quakes in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Their data has helped reveal the geometric structure of faults in the San 
Gabriel Valley, the direction of slippage in earthquakes, the geometric and 
geologic fit of faults and the determination of fault systems. Such information 
can yield the discovery of potentially hazardous faults or future earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this research activity, much is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what makes them start or stop," Jones said. "Or why they happen 
today instead of tomorrow. We don't know what is the trigger."

PEOPLE: IN MARATHONS, HE MANAGES TO SKATE BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Genco of Covina plans to set a record in the Los Angeles Marathon this 
Sunday as the first amputee to skate 35 marathons on one leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he concedes, he's probably the only one-legged marathon skater. 
</P>
<P>
 Genco, 58, propels his 120-pound body by thrusting his crutches, customized 
with special shock-absorbing tips, tennis handle grips and arm rests wrapped 
with red, white and blue duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 A hypnotist by trade, Genco got the idea to skate a marathon from a client, a 
competitive roller skater from Long Beach. He raced the Long Beach Marathon in 
1979 and got hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has raced every Los Angeles Marathon since the event began nine 
years ago, and has finished all of them. It takes him a little under four hours 
to complete the 26-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost his right leg when he was 3 because of a birth defect, but Genco says 
he never felt limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a large family, with 11 brothers and sisters, so I did everything 
they did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That included biking, swimming and leading a Boy Scout troop. But one-legged 
marathon skating was a sport he developed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the trials all marathon runners face -- heat, thirst, exhaustion -- 
Genco has his own. Strewn with cast-off paper cups, the streets are an obstacle 
course. One year, he slipped on a cup, Genco said. Another time it was an 
orange peel, another time a piece of candy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The runners are really great," he said. "They picked me up, threw me on my 
crutches, and said keep on going."

UNEARTHING AN UNSPOKEN RAGE; ELLIS COSE EXPLORES THE ANGER OF BLACK 
PROFESSIONALS FEELING STYMIED BY RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hushed conflict simmers, a disquiet of a difficult sort, hard to discern, 
even harder to rectify. Underneath, however, it rages. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new book, "The Rage of a Privileged Class" (HarperCollins), Newsweek 
essayist Ellis Cose sees what he terms a broken covenant as the root of the 
often unspoken rage among many African American professionals. It is, says 
Cose, "a serious American problem: . . . the broken covenant of the pact 
ensuring that if you work hard, get a good education and play by the rules, you 
will be allowed to advance and achieve to the limits of your ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Successful by outward appearances and ever striving, many African Americans 
box daily (and inwardly, most times) with a subtler hue of racism, 
discrimination and alienation set deep within corporate America's concrete 
core. So many have found that no matter the background or the physical 
trappings -- Coach bag, tony address, season tickets to the opera -- somehow 
they will never be allowed the same perks and privileges afforded their 
upwardly mobile white colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether persistently passed over for promotion, locked into a "black job" 
(community affairs director, for example) or blatantly not invited to the 
country club, many black professionals choose silence, rather than make waves, 
and mark time until they explode. 
</P>
<P>
 Cose conducted a series of interviews with black professionals -- many who 
hold Ivy League degrees, take home upward of $50,000 annually and excel in a 
myriad of professions from law and academia to journalism -- to confront the 
sobering reality of the post-civil-rights landscape. Although some African 
Americans reaped rewards, thus gaining access to a once-off-limits world, Cose 
asks why "a full generation after the most celebrated civil rights battles were 
fought and won, are Americans still struggling with basic issues of racial 
fairness?" 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to square promise with reality centers this flame of rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of 'things' happening, instead of careers taking off," writes Cose, 
"blacks are being stymied. They are not running into a glass ceiling . . . but 
into one made of cement and steel . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Cose forages for answers or, at the least, primes the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Race does matter, its hold on public consciousness, not a phantom, but quite 
real. So, too, is the fear that vocalizing inequities could damage, if not 
cost, a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: At the heart of the book is the whole question of America's 
difficulty addressing discrimination and racism. What do we have the most 
trouble talking about? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I don't think we have trouble talking about race. I think we have 
trouble talking about it intelligently. . . . We tend to talk in stereotypes, 
or in sound-bites, or from behind huge defenses we've erected . . . . People 
don't see the same reality. You almost get into this caricature of a 
conversation . 
</P>
<P>
 You have whites going through all kinds of contortions trying to prove that 
they aren't racist . . . that what you think is racist isn't racist. And then 
you have blacks going through the opposite sort of dance . . . . So you have 
people who . . . connect with somebody of another race as a representative as 
opposed to as a person . 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So many black professionals end up serving as cultural ambassadors or are 
seen as something as separate and apart from the rest of the race? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. . . . Given the way things have worked in this country, it is much 
more likely that blacks are going to know whites, than that whites are going to 
know blacks. So you are forever having blacks put in this situation of having 
to sort of explain black people to white people. . . . Because of the 
misperceptions, because of the stereo types . . . it's no surprise that you 
have a hell of a time having an intelligent conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You write that "creating a color-blind society on a foundation saturated 
with the venom of racism requires something more than simply proclaiming that 
the age of brotherhood has arrived." It's often difficult for a person of color 
to explain just why such a society is not a realistic possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. And it's so hard to cut through. Part of the reason why so many people 
who are white want to declare that society is color blind is because they are 
most commonly the ones who are blamed for being racist. To be a racist is to be 
a bad person -- and they're not bad people . . . they are "color blind . " . . 
. People will say: "I'm not racist, but . . ." and the "but," inevitably 
(precedes) something that you would think was racist. . . . But (since) they 
started off by saying "I'm not racist," it's like this magic incantation: All 
of a sudden it makes everything perfect.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cose says he didn't want to write a book that could be misconstrued as a 
treatise stating that the sole barrier blocking blacks from mainstream success 
was racism: "Because that's too easy to dismiss. . . . It isn't so. In a sense 
it's a much more subtle reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many black professionals he encountered looked at the chance to tell 
their stories as long-awaited catharses, some deny that discrimination has 
posed any real threat, or at least never cast a shadow over their own progress. 
The theory is that if you try hard enough, no wall is too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Author and professor Shelby Steele, lauded and vilified after his 
controversial collection of essays, "The Content of Our Character," appeared in 
1990, believes that perceived inequities are at times exaggerated, and that too 
much is passed off as a casualty of race. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 25 years the stresses of new freedom, which have greatly 
intensified black vulnerability, have led us . . . to claim more racial 
victimization than we have actually endured as a way of recomposing that 
unacknowledged vulnerability," writes Steele, who, like Cose, is black. "This 
is not to say that we have not experienced victimization, only that our claims 
have been excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You touch a lot on the sense of alienation many middle-class blacks 
experience. What is at the root of it and how does it most commonly manifest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some of it isn't that much different from alienation . . . blacks of any 
economic strata in this country (feel), which has to do with the whole sense of 
opportunities being denied or of inequities being present. I think some of it 
is fairly unique to people who are middle class, or at least to people who are 
striving for certain kinds of accomplishments. . . . They've invested heavily . 
. . yet still find certain doors don't seem to open for them. I think that 
alienation is a little bit different than the people who sort of decided very 
early: "Hey, the game is stacked against me so I'm not going to play."  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are your hopes for racial parity in this country? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Certainly we're not going to reach it in this generation. But I think if we 
abandon it as a goal then we are in effect saying that we accept a second caste 
system for blacks and that we accept ceilings on black aspirations and that we 
accept this severe racial stratification because we can't do any better. I 
think its worse to accept that than to continue work toward ending it.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: In your research, did you find more people who still have a fighting spirit 
than those on the verge of giving up? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. And it may very well be because most of the people I interviewed . . 
. were fairly successful, who even though they were still dealing with a lot of 
negatives in their lives, had clearly come quite far . . . . With black 
Americans in general, we are accustomed to dealing with all of these kinds of 
problems. We as a race have never decided en masse to give up. Clearly a lot of 
us have, but I think that as a majority, we're far from that. * 
</P>
<P>
 Added to an already formidable load, Cose points out, the black middle class 
is often taken to task for not taking care of "its own," or as the venerable 
church saying goes: "Lifting as you rise." 
</P>
<P>
 As the underclass continues to struggle, pundits black and white, and 
agitators from the Left and the Right point to those who have ascended to 
provide relief or, at the very least, some semblance of a solution. This, Cose 
argues, only makes it that much more difficult to move racial dialogue out of a 
narrow and skewed arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of race (especially when it comes to the discussion of the 
struggle of some African Americans) seems forever tethered to poverty and 
crime, as if inseparable. Media saturate us with depictions of the deplorable 
living conditions and hopeless existences that confine a segment of black 
America and, Cose concedes, they are as excruciating as they are demanding of 
our attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he stresses, "America can hardly afford to use the plight of the black 
poor as an excuse for blinding itself to the difficulties of the black upwardly 
mobile. . . . Moreover, one must at least consider the possibility that a 
nation which embitters those struggling hardest to believe in it and work 
within its established systems is seriously undermining any effort to provide 
would-be hustlers and dope dealers with an attractive alternative to the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems of one, he says, fail to cancel those of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a level of resentment that exists on the part of the underclass in 
regard to the privileged who express resentment over racism, or not being able 
to get even further ahead? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's a bit more complex than resentment from people who are not 
able to get ahead. I think that we as a society have some serious problems with 
blacks who are successful, and I think that we particularly have problems with 
blacks who are successful in what is considered the mainstream because, first 
of all, there is this assumption that real blacks, authentic blacks are poor. 
So if you're not and you're doing OK, somehow you stop being black.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Or you're not black enough?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Right. So you hear a lot of this talk. There is a lot of resentment anyway, 
because there is a sense . . . on the parts of many whites that these people 
ought to just be grateful because they have somehow transcended the natural 
state of blackness. And I think there is also a resentment from a lot of blacks 
who feel that these people have somehow . . . abandoned them or sold out . . . 
. And certainly in some cases that might be true, but at the root of it is a 
lot of ambivalence about black success in this society. And I think that cuts 
across color lines.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You observe that as the nation progresses, we've moved from a country 
concerned about the denial of civil rights to one obsessed with reverse racism 
and quota systems. How and why did that happen? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the sense of a lot of white people was that: "We've been working on 
this race thing for a long time. It must be solved." But I think the other part 
of it is that a lot of . . . whites in general began to feel vulnerable -- 
especially as we entered the perilous economic times and people started getting 
laid off from work, and started hearing that they had lost their job because of 
some affirmative action program . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I think a lot of whites decided . . . that they were the ones who were being 
disadvantaged . . . . And from their vantage point it's easy to see how they 
got there -- when they are hearing from demagogues in their workplace that all 
these minorities and women are taking all the jobs. And since they don't really 
see what's going on clearly with black Americans, and since they certainly 
don't hold themselves responsible for the bad things that are happening to 
black Americans, they feel abused.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: For those African Americans who are struggling through corporate America, 
what do you recommended as a tool for coping? 
</P>
<P>
 A: By trying very hard to get yourself rooted . . . having an identity that is 
beyond work. . . . For some people it means devoting themselves to community 
work. For other people it just means maintaining close contacts with people who 
they know accept them . . . I think that many people who are in that situation, 
who work in these corporations feel . . . they have to almost apologize for 
doing it, and sort of apologize for being what they are. And that's just an 
unhealthy situation. I think people certainly need to convince themselves that 
they need not feel guilty because they are working in the white man's 
corporation.

 "Mom, where do crash-test dummies come from?" 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that crash dummies can get into more than one type of accident, a 
pregnant mannequin turned up recently in a General Motors test laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, neither Vince nor Larry, symbols of seat-belt sanity and stars of 
countless TV safety commercials, has taken responsibility for siring the 
plastoid bundle of joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, GM and University of Michigan scientists are conducting research 
into the safety of both mother and child in car crashes, going so far as to 
create an "inert dummy" that simulates a 7-month-old fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 They strongly recommend seat belts for all pregnant women, just as for 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 We still can't help but wonder where to find cigars that say: "It's a dummy."

BED AND (REALLY) BORED; SHOPPING: SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT MATTRESS IN A SEA OF 
'POCKETED COIL SYSTEMS' AND 'REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY' CAN BE SLEEP INDUCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Can I help you?" asks Bea the department store saleswoman, dwarfed in a 
wall-to-wall sea of mattress technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a new bed," you say. 
</P>
<P>
 A big bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Big enough for two adults, one small-but-growing child, one baby who's just 
learned to roll, seven Dr. Seuss books, a laptop computer, two Sunday 
newspapers, a portable TV, a breakfast table and four pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 And a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite song of your small-but-growing child runs through your head: 
"There-were-four- in-the-bed, and-the-little-one-said, 'Roll over! Roll over!' 
So-they-all-rolled-over and one-fell-out. Plop. There-were-three-in-the-bed . . 
.' "  
</P>
<P>
 So it's not just a bed you're buying. It's a place to hang out for the next 
10.8 years. Fittingly, the $4 billion bedding industry agrees. They don't just 
sell you a mattress. It's a mattress and box spring, also known as a "sleep 
set." 
</P>
<P>
 Never go to buy one alone, unless, of course, you live that way. So says the 
Better Sleep Council of Alexandria, Va. So you drag along the growing child, 
the second adult and the rolling baby for a morning of bed browsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a look," says Bea, the sleep set saleswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an ocean of sleep sets stripped down to their pale stitched floral outer 
coverings, which top the piles of inner "comfort layers," pocketed coil systems 
and hundreds of coils in the "revolutionary technology" of the continuous-wire 
spring unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whew. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the superpremium, the ultrapremium, the Correct Posture Maxipedic. The 
Beautyrest Superb. The Posturpedic Concerto. The Crown Jewel. The Correct 
Comfort Deluxe. 
</P>
<P>
 You can go firm-firm, plain firm, soft-soft, plain soft, super support, plain 
support, all with varying density, thickness and choices of filler material. 
</P>
<P>
 The rolling baby begins to cry. You sit down on a soft-soft. You sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 The bed. Inevitable, immutable. The place where you go every night, come rain 
or shine or PostureTech Coil with patented Sensory Arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sine qua non ," says Alan Dundes, University of California, Berkeley 
professor of anthropology. "It's basic. Bed and board. Bed and breakfast. You 
can do without a dining room table or you can set your books up with bricks and 
boards. But people need a place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 A place to recuperate. To spend roughly 220,000 hours, or approximately 
one-third of the average lifetime, or more if you count the VCR, the Seuss 
books and the Sunday papers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "King or queen?" Bea wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here, in the showroom, that it all happens. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where bed meets American marketing to plumb the singular psychology of 
the American mattress consumer. Think about it: The bed is the only piece of 
furniture that plays a pivotal role in every major life stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's where we play, create, love, conceive, convalesce and give birth," says 
Alecia Beldegreen, New York interior designer and author of "The Bed," a 1991 
coffee-table pictorial history. "It's where we dream and where we die. It's 
where the entire human drama is enacted." 
</P>
<P>
 Swell. All of a sudden, you're not just buying a mattress. You're choosing a 
stage and sound system for the Day on the Green of your life. In fact, Rossini 
composed operas in bed, Beldegreen says. "Proust wrote 'Remembrance of Things 
Past' in bed. Winston Churchill governed Britain from bed. French kings held 
court and issued edicts from bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Groucho Marx was right: Anything that can't be done in a bed isn't worth 
doing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's see . . . if you hook up the laptop to the system at the office, sell 
the car, join the Internet, invest in an interactive phone system with fax 
machine and cappuccino maker, you'll never have to leave this 
comfort-option-laden corner of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The song crescendos. " . . . and-the-little-one - said, 'Roll over! Roll 
over!' "  
</P>
<P>
 Bea the sleep set saleswoman reels you back to the mission at hand: Joining 
the ranks of Americans who last year purchased nearly 30 million adult-size 
conventional mattresses and box springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bedding is a very promotion-driven business," says a marketing executive from 
one of the leading U.S. mattress manufacturers. "People don't walk around in 
their normal day thinking about their mattresses. But then there's some 
trigger, usually a life event, like a change in family structure, a marriage, a 
move, a backache. The trigger establishes a need. Then the consumer is open to 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, suddenly, all the world's a bed. Every newspaper seems to carry a 
10% Bonus-Savings, Four-Days-Only! mattress sales (Plus Free Bed Frame!). Your 
friends don't just have beds, they have box spring dimensions. The freeway 
teems with Chevy Luvs transporting old ones to college-freshman apartment 
dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 You start wondering about practical things, such as, just where did Louis XIV 
keep his 400-plus beds? How did he wash the sheets? 
</P>
<P>
 When Hugh Hefner became a new father a few of years ago, did he buy a rubber 
protective mattress cover for his famous circular bed? 
</P>
<P>
 And if Macbeth had tried a Correct Comfort 3000 FX with heavy duty insulators 
and hourglass coils, would he still have heard the voice that cried, "Sleep no 
more?" At this point, you are ready to buy. But which? 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, there were no choices. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only straw and animal hide. Later there were feathers and covers and 
pillows piled high -- the higher the pillows, the more important the bed's 
occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beds have always denoted status," Beldegreen says. Of course, there were 
variations along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlemagne and other medieval warriors slept on beds propped up at 45-degree 
angles so they could spring into battle at a second's notice. The Japanese 
favored the futon. Persian nomads, the water-filled goatskin and still others, 
the hammock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Industrial Revolution brought the spring, which made the bed bounce. Soon 
followed the ingenuity of the American bedding industry, which turned the 
Princess and the Pea into king- and queen-size "advanced mattress technology." 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last 30 years we've evolved with a lot of different techniques, many 
more types of filling materials and spring technologies," says Donald S. Simon, 
chairman of the Serta Mattress Co. in the sleepy Northern California town of 
Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started in this business almost 50 years ago," says Simon, "there were 
two firmnesses, soft and firm, in two qualities. Today, it's like women's 
ready-to-wear. There's a new invention every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Like coil count. Coil gauge. Special construction to add support to the lumbar 
region. Posturized filler. Foam, fiber, wool padding. Comfort layers. Degrees 
of thickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of it as giving people more comfort options," says Andrea Herman of 
the Better Sleep Council. "Sleep is a very individualized comfort issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Add the finicky regional retailers who want their own particular color, 
design, stitching or quarter-inch adjustment here or there, and a mattress 
maker could end up with 10, 20 or 50 slight variations on a particular mattress 
theme, each with a different name. Masterpiece Grandeur. Masterpiece Marquis. 
Correct. Exquisite. Elite. Classic. Harder-Than-Nails. Softer-Than-Springtime. 
</P>
<P>
 You ask Bea the sleep set saleswoman what the names mean. "They're just 
names," she says. "Like Bob and Bill and Sue. You have to try them to see which 
one you like. Like Goldilocks." 
</P>
<P>
 You look around and see that it has already happened. In the corner of the 
showroom is a light blue king-size set where the second adult, the growing 
child and the rolling baby are happily recovering from the morning's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take that one."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; THE BIG STUDY; THE SAT COLLEGE-ENTRANCE EXAM HAS 
UNDERGONE SOME MAJOR CHANGES. WILL CRAMMING HELP? INSTRUCTORS OF PREPARATION 
COURSES SAY MOST STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM TEST-TAKING AND TIME-MANAGEMENT 
STRATEGIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HALLIE KIM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hallie Kim is a senior at Brea Olinda High 
School in Brea. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 College entrance exams are enough to make any high school student worry. 
</P>
<P>
 And recent changes to the Scholastic Aptitude Test -- the first since 1974 -- 
have spurred new anxieties, with more students signing up for preparation 
courses and others trying to absorb new test-taking strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2 1/2-hour exam, to be given next on March 19, was renamed last year to 
Scholastic Assessment Test I (SAT I). Students preregister for the test, which 
is used along with grades and other information by colleges to determine 
whether an applicant will be admitted. It is taken by juniors and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The SAT I still includes two 30-minute verbal sections and two 30-minute math 
sections. However, the Test of Standard Written English, a section universities 
had once used to determine placement in English courses, has been eliminated. 
In its place will be one 15-minute verbal section and one 15-minute math 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 Alterations in the verbal sections include the elimination of antonym 
questions, the addition of dual-passage exercises and an increased emphasis on 
critical reading questions. Changes to the math sections allow the use of a 
calculator and "student-produced response questions," in which answer choices 
are not provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the verbal, there's an attempt, a desire to test more directly some of the 
critical reading skills and some of the reasoning skills that are needed in 
higher education," said David Hubin, chairman of the SAT Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubin, who is executive assistant to the president at the University of 
Oregon, said changes were made with the intention of bringing the SAT "more in 
line with the type of reasoning skills that students are going to need in 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reading comprehension portion of the exam is expanded. In one part, for 
example, there are questions that ask you to relate two passages that both deal 
with a theme and to look for points of comparison, to look for ways in which 
the authors might agree or disagree. So, in a sense, it tests some higher-level 
skills of reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the test-taking advice offered by Hubin and instructors of preparation 
courses, which vary from one-day workshops to six-day courses and can cost from 
under $100 to more than $600, concerns familiarity with the test and time 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Even "The Official Guide to the New SAT I," which is published by the College 
Board and is distributed free at high schools, states: "Become thoroughly 
familiar with the test directions." 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Teri Sorey, an instructor at the SAT I verbal skills 
workshops that are part of the university extension program at UC Irvine, 
familiarity with the test is reason enough to take an SAT I preparation course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a smart move, if nothing more than to become familiar with what you'll 
be expected to do," Sorey said, adding that it is important to "take some 
practice pretests and determine what are your strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking a preparation class can help confidence levels," Sorey added. "When 
you walk into the test, you've done it so many times and you're so familiar 
with the strategy that I think it eases the stress level. And that alone can 
help students do better." 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming familiar with the test will also help students know how to budget 
time, Sorey said. That way, students will know which tasks are easier or harder 
and "to do the easier things first, so that you don't run out of time."  
</P>
<P>
 One time-management strategy, according to Adam Sand, director of Princeton 
Review in Orange County, a test-preparation firm, is to approach each verbal 
section knowing that some questions take less time to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the verbal side, one of the things that we're saying is, you should do 
(each section) not in the order they give it to you, but in the order that 
makes more sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The analogies are actually some of the easiest questions on the test. You 
should do the analogies first. Then you do the sentence completion and then do 
the critical reading last. . . . All the questions are worth the exact same 
amount of points, so why take your time on critical reading -- questions that 
will take you so long because you have to read the whole passage to do those 
questions -- when you can get the exact amount of points for an analogy that 
might take you 30 seconds?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other techniques for the verbal sections include ways to approach the 
dual-passage reading comprehension exercise. Students at the UCI Extension 
workshops are encouraged "to skim the questions first, then read the first 
passage (and) answer the questions that are about the first passage, (which) 
will always be the first batch of questions," Sorey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then skim the next batch of questions, read the second passage, answer the 
next batch of questions -- the last two, or three at most, will be asking them 
to compare. Don't read both passages and then answer the first questions. Just 
treat them as two separate things until you can get to the last couple of 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob McIlhenny instructs SAT prep courses through the community services 
departments at Orange Coast and Irvine Valley community colleges. One method he 
encourages is to divide a reading passage into parts for easier comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have (the students) read the questions before they read the section itself. 
Then take the section and divide it up into 10- to 12-line increments," 
McIlhenny said. "And then, sort of digest each section at a time and maybe take 
little notes or underline words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of this . . . they usually can answer three to four of the five 
questions there right off the bat." 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to any reading comprehension exercise, single-passage or dual, is 
"active reading" and comprehension, Hubin said. "One of the things I believe 
affects a student's verbal section, particularly in the reading comprehension 
section, is the ability to concentrate while doing the reading comprehension 
passages." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tendency for that to be the section where a student's mind wanders 
and they start to wonder (why) they're reading something about a particular 
topic when it's not one that interests them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've recommended to students," Hubin said, "is that they set up a mental 
framework to concentrate on the article by first skimming it and then skimming 
. . . the questions, not with the idea that they would try to answer those 
questions without reading it, but to set up a framework so that they can 
anticipate what it is that the article or two articles deal with. And then to 
rehearse reading actively, to read with questions in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 That is far more productive than trying to "concentrate better by 
concentrating better on concentrating," Hubin said. "For example, if you're 
reading something about flotation in the gray whale, even if that's not a topic 
intrinsically interesting to you, you should pose questions like, why does a 
whale float? Under what conditions? Does cold water affect it? . . . and so 
forth. And almost contrive active engagement with the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 To handle analogy questions, the preparation courses give students the mental 
tools to help define the relationship of words. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put the two words that are in the analogy in a definitive sentence 
showing their relationships. And you drop the words out, then try all your 
choices. You don't change your sentence at all, though," McIlhenny said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite everything," Sorey observed, "the one common denominator in terms of 
high scores in the verbal section of the SAT is the amount of reading a student 
does. (High scoring students) are the kids who have been reading since they 
were young. That's their habit. That's how they learn vocabulary. That's how 
they learn sentence structure. . . . That's how they develop their thinking 
skills in order to have the logic to do the analogy sections of the test.

<P>
 "For these kids, going through the SAT is an exercise rather than challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 New test-taking instructions on the math section cover the use of a calculator 
and the completion of "student-produced response questions," also known as 
"grid-ins." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be critical for students to get a sense of when the calculator 
is a useful tool and when it's a distraction and time-consuming. And to do 
that, they need to practice," acknowledged SAT committee chairman Hubin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students should make sure that they're using a calculator they're completely 
comfortable with. Essentially, a basic, four-function calculator is all that's 
needed. Students should know that calculator well and should have done a 
practice test and already rehearsed what types of problems they'd want to use a 
calculator on and what types of ones they'd come to realize they could solve 
better by estimation or some method other than calculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Princeton Review director Sand advises students similarly: "The 
calculator is recommended, but it's not required. . . . One of the techniques 
that we actually stress is that the calculator is your friend but don't overuse 
it. I have a feeling that most students, when they have a calculator in their 
hand, it's their crutch." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as grid-ins, Hubin recommends familiarity. "Most students have taken 
multiple-choice exams, and most students have taken problem-solving exams in 
their math course work. But this is a format that they should become familiar 
with, where you actually grid in bubbles indicating the mathematical value that 
you're choosing, and students would benefit from practice on that." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dealing with the concept of 'hey, there's no guessing here,' . . 
. you need to start from scratch and deal with these, but (it's good to) come 
up with some sort of an answer because there's no penalty for guessing," 
McIlhenny said. "So, don't spend a lot of time on it, but realize that it's 
well worth your while to at least try them." 
</P>
<P>
 Students greet the changes with mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like the math changes, the grid-ins, because . . . when they 
had the multiple choice for all of them, you kind of had the benefit of the 
doubt and you could plug in answers," said Jaime Saul, a 16-year-old junior at 
Villa Park High School who is enrolled in the Princeton Review courses there. 
"But this way, it's all you. You have to come up with the right answer, and I 
don't like that."  
</P>
<P>
 Says Dan Henig, 16, also a junior at Villa Park: '(The dual passage) is really 
hard because it's toward the end of the test usually, and you're already tired 
from reading everything else. It's pretty hard because you have to compare . . 
. while you're running out of time." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Villa Park High School junior Bryan Choate, 16, who also attends the 
Princeton Review, likes the changes. "In a way, I kind of actually like the 
grid-ins because you get a more definite answer with what you do and it's not 
like you really have to guess at anything. Once you get your answer, you can 
put it in." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sand, the changes are minimal. "They've really only changed 25% 
of the test." Test Yourself 
</P>
<P>
 The more familiar you are with the SAT I, the more comfortable you'll be 
taking it, say those who coach students for the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Free booklets containing a complete practice test are available at school 
counseling centers. Those taking the practice test need to set aside several 
hours, using the same timing allowed during the actual test. 
</P>
<P>
 Hints from the booklet: Don't waste time during the actual test by reading 
directions -- learn them ahead of time. Be familiar with answer sheets. 
Practice using your calculator. Read the booklet thoroughly and don't throw it 
away -- there are test-taking tips you may want to review right before the 
test.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; A REMEMBRANCE; THOMAS HALLEEN: A CARING TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA OKIKAWA, Lisa Okikawa is is a senior at Cypress High School in Cypress. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are few times in our lives when we are deeply touched by the courage and 
determination of a single person. Recently, the faculty and students of Cypress 
High School suffered a great loss in the death of teacher Thomas Halleen. 
</P>
<P>
 Halleen was chairman of the Social Science Department, as well as an English, 
government, sociology and world history teacher. He had been an instructor at 
the school for 21 years. He helped shape the school before its opening, giving 
his views on how it should look and influencing school rules and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had a law degree, he chose teaching as his profession, for he was 
happiest with "his children." Halleen enjoyed challenging his students' minds 
-- purposely taking opposing views during discussions in order to provoke 
thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 A "celebration of life" ceremony was held at Cypress High for Halleen 
following his death Feb. 8. Many students spoke fondly of their teacher; of his 
influence on their lives. One student said Halleen had "made me a better 
person." Another called Halleen "my mentor and guide." Halleen knew outward 
appearances weren't important; thoughts were. He knew what people were all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Halleen had suffered several heart attacks, yet he always bounced back with 
more energy to teach his students and to be with the people he cared most 
about. Despite having cancer diagnosed last year, he came as often as possible 
to teach.  
</P>
<P>
 Since his death, many have mentioned Halleen's smile and genuine caring for 
others. He was especially in tune with the younger generation, even listening 
to their music. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students looked forward to entering his class at the beginning of the 
year, to being a part of his classroom discussions. I feel fortunate to have 
been among his students. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be greatly missed. The kindness and humor he displayed so easily will 
forever be remembered.

IN CALIFORNIA, THE KING DIDN'T DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN HOGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Golden State -- home to the California Dream, the California Roll and . . 
. the California King mattress. Dimensions: 72 inches wide and 84 inches 
long.That's four inches longer and four inches narrower than king-size beds 
made and sold in the other 49 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Just why is a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say it's because Californians are more freewheeling. Others say the 
Cal-King, as it is sometimes called, simply is built for tall, thin people. If 
you move your California King to, say, Cleveland, it's a headache: You must 
special-order sheets to fit your now odd-sized bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how a bed became king, according to bed manufacturing lore: 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after World War II, a Los Angeles mattress merchant decided that 
Californians, Angelenos in particular, had big enough houses and big enough 
lifestyles to warrant Big Beds. So he built a bed six feet wide by seven feet 
long, or 72 inches by 84 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 And he called it the California King. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers in other parts of the country thought the Big Bed was a great 
idea, but that the Californian was not. If you build the Big Bed 76 inches 
wide, they argued, all you have to do is double up two single box springs (38 
inches wide) underneath. If you make it 80 inches long, you just have to add an 
extra row of coils. 
</P>
<P>
 This King caught on. It was dubbed the "Eastern King" to distinguish it from 
its longer, narrower California counterpart, which Golden State manufacturers 
held to for reasons the rest of the world can only guess at. 
</P>
<P>
 As one mattress merchant says: "It's great for Michael Jordan, but I'm 5-8, so 
it doesn't do a thing for me." MARY ANN HOGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; HOSPITAL COOL TO MERGER WITH RIVAL CATHOLIC FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of South Bay Hospital in Redondo Beach have given a cool reception 
to a merger proposal from a rival hospital in Torrance, labeling it 
"unacceptable" and saying negotiations are under way with two other potential 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 But the merger proposal, from Little Company of Mary Health Services, will 
still be discussed at a public meeting at the hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Company of Mary announced Friday that it was interested in buying the 
203-bed South Bay Hospital and merging it with its 374-bed nonprofit Catholic 
hospital in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 That would reduce the number of acute-care hospitals from four to three in the 
southern South Bay area.  
</P>
<P>
 The financially ailing South Bay Hospital recently lost a major managed-care 
contract with Cigna Health Care of California that accounted for 22% of its net 
revenue. The hospital also has been hurt by changes in the health-care 
business, such as shorter patient stays and increased emphasis on managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Company of Mary proposal calls for creating a single hospital with 
two sites. South Bay Hospital, which is now publicly owned and privately 
managed, would become a nonprofit Catholic facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal was deemed "unacceptable" by South Bay Hospital Executive 
Director Dennis Bruns. In a letter dated Friday, Bruns told Little Company of 
Mary officials that South Bay Hospital's operator, American Medical 
International, "is currently in negotiations with other prospective operators." 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of South Bay Hospital would be complicated by its status as a 
publicly owned facility that is leased to a commercial hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations would involve at least three parties: the potential buyer, AMI 
and the Beach Cities Health District, the public agency that owns the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in the three beach cities might be required to approve a sale, 
depending on the terms of the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 The health district's board of directors plans to discuss the Little Company 
of Mary proposal at its meeting at 5 p.m. today. The meeting, in the auditorium 
at South Bay Hospital, 514 N. Prospect Ave, is open to the public.

TRADE SHOW IN VIETNAM TO BE ALL-AMERICAN AFFAIR; COMMERCE: O.C. CONSULTANTS 
SEEKING POTENTIAL CLIENTS TO ATTEND EVENT LIMITED TO U.S. COMPANIES. IT BEGINS 
APRIL 21. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs from across the United States are preparing for the first trade 
show in Vietnam since the fall of Saigon in 1975 to exclusively feature U.S. 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 companies have signed up to exhibit their wares in Hanoi at a 
four-day fair that begins April 21, said Dick Pirozzolo, a spokesman for 
Vietnam Investment Information & Consulting in San Diego, which is organizing 
the trade show. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam has played host to other trade fairs since the Communist government 
took over, but this will be the first to feature American firms only, said Ban 
Doan, an aide to Vietnam's United Nations ambassador in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will benefit both Vietnam and America," Doan said. "The two sides can 
exchange commerce information and talk about working together." 
</P>
<P>
 Major firms participating at the expo include soda bottler Pepsico Inc. of 
Purchase, N.Y., and Radix Group International, a Los Angeles firm that arranges 
freight shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to get a hotel room in Hanoi since February," said Ellen 
Numis, director of sales and marketing for Radix. "Everything's booked up 
because of the trade show." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County consultants will attend the fair, hoping to network with 
potential clients, though no county businesses have signed up to exhibit their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 George Dang, an international business consultant and president of Alca 
International Co. in Irvine, said he will travel the 8,500 miles to Hanoi to 
meet with potential clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam is the gold rush right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wendy Kroll, president of Healthcare Professional Management Inc. in 
Irvine, will rendezvous at the fair with leaders of the Vietnamese Women's 
Union, which works on women's issues, to discuss how to bring immunization to 
Vietnamese children at low costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many pharmaceutical companies that want to do business with 
Vietnam," Kroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Vietnamese singer who has been popular in Vietnam since the 1960s will 
travel from Westminster to Hanoi to entertain at the trade expo. Organizers 
declined to release his name, fearing he might be harassed by factions in the 
Vietnamese American community that are opposed to reconciliation with the 
Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County singer will be the first expatriate musician to perform in a 
major concert in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure he gets to the trade show safely," said Peter Tran, 
co-executive director for VIIC. 
</P>
<P>
 Since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo with Vietnam Feb. 3, American 
companies can now share in as much as $9 billion worth of trade and investment 
in that country, according to the United States-Vietnam Trade Council in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty U.S. firms already have representative offices there through a special 
license granted by the U.S. Department of Treasury, but they have not been 
allowed to conduct actual business. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, Vietnam has bought more than $4 billion in goods from 
Asian and European nations, according to VIIC. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said he and fellow colleagues at VIIC decided to organize the expo after 
their first return visit to their birthplaces two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were walking around the open markets and saw American products being sold 
illegally everywhere," he said. "American things are so popular in Vietnam, 
though trade shows have only featured European and Asian products. We thought, 
'Why not have an expo for American companies?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The expo came together quickly with the cooperation of the two governments, 
which were eager to share in the benefits a trade fair might bring. 
</P>
<P>
 It was arranged in September, months before Clinton's decision to lift the 
trade embargo. But VIIC officials said the U.S. Department of Treasury's 
approval of the fair signaled to them months ago that the embargo would soon 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't make sense for the U.S. government to allow their companies to 
display goods only to take those goods back to America," Tran said. "Businesses 
want a chance to sell their products at the trade show." 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton announced the lifting of the commerce ban, he also said 
negotiators would discuss the opening of liaison offices between the two 
countries. On Wednesday, U.S. and Vietnamese officials announced that the two 
governments have agreed in principle to open offices in each other's capitals, 
a key step toward establishing diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. office in Vietnam's capital would deal with trade and human rights 
issues and continue the effort to uncover information about American MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
 VIIC officials said they hope the opening of Communist Vietnam to U.S. trade 
will increase the standard of living for the country's 71 million people, whose 
per capita income in 1992 was about $220 annually. More foreign presence in the 
Southeast Asian country might also improve human rights for residents there, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As more people find jobs, they can better feed and clothe their families," 
said Hung Le, co-executive director for the consulting firm. "And hopefully 
freedom would slowly come in, too." 
</P>
<P>
 With a literacy rate of 88%, Vietnam's well-educated population promises not 
just a market for U.S. products such as soft drinks and electronics, but also a 
potentially low-cost labor pool, VIIC executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the trade show has yet occurred, VIIC executives are so confident it 
will succeed that they have begun planning a second one -- this time in Ho Chi 
Minh City (formerly Saigon) in October.

RAMS HIT WITH ULTIMATUM ON PRACTICE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a testy exchange between the Los Angeles Rams and local officials, the 
school district that owns the team's practice facility has told the Rams to 
renew their lease on the Rams Park complex by March 11 or get out. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by protracted negotiations, Magnolia School District officials 
issued the ultimatum in a letter this week. Team officials replied that they 
may have to abandon the spot where players have practiced since 1980 and look 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease impasse has increased speculation that the Rams intend to leave 
Anaheim after next season. The Rams have publicly stated they are interested in 
exploring deals with other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Mercier, superintendent of the Magnolia School District, said the Rams 
have refused to sign a lease agreement that essentially was completed several 
weeks ago. Ram officials have repeatedly stalled the negotiations by raising 
"non-issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much longer can they drag this out?" Mercier asked. "The board is saying, 
'Let's have a decision.' Either this (agreement) is something you can live with 
or not. They're beating the same stuff to death." 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Rams executive vice president, said the team has "no intention" of 
signing the present lease offer, which covers the practice facility at the 
former Juliette Low Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the strong possibility that we could be evicted from the 
practice facility," Shaw said. "It looks like that is what they will do and I 
guess we will have to figure out (where we will find) another practice site." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle is Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth, who is acting as 
chief negotiator in the talks on the lease agreement. "We're trying to work out 
an amicable resolution to this," said Ruth. "The school district has been 
terrific. In my opinion this should not be that difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said the Rams "just want to pin down the details (of the 
agreement) like any other business would do." 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff on the practice facility lease has heightened tensions between 
team and city officials who seem on the verge of parting ways after a 15-year 
marriage. Rams officials have publicly said they are looking at more modern 
stadiums and better financial opportunities in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the team will officially notify the city May 3 that it is exercising 
an escape clause in its Anaheim Stadium lease agreement. The notification means 
the Rams will be free to look elsewhere, but they still could negotiate with 
Anaheim and decide to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercier said he suspects the team "is stringing the district along" until it 
knows where it will ultimately play. 
</P>
<P>
 Since moving to Anaheim from Los Angeles in 1980, the Rams have used the 
school site under a complicated agreement among the city, the team and the 
district. Under it, the city sublet the site from the district and then leased 
it to the Rams. That agreement expired Dec. 31, but was extended for a month by 
the district so all parties could renegotiate a lease extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times in the past two months, city and district officials said they 
thought they had reached a deal with the Rams only to have the team refuse to 
sign the agreement. In fact, the agreement has been on the City Council's 
agenda for approval five times since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," said Mercier, who noted that the city has made great 
efforts to resolve the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the agreement was yanked off the agenda once again. Under that 
aborted document, the Rams would have signed a 10-year lease with a five-year 
extension option. The lease would have provided an escape clause for the Rams, 
allowing the team to leave after giving six months' notice and paying the 
school district one year's rent of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement also had the city subsidizing $120,000 of the team's annual 
$250,000 rent, with the subsidy coming out of Anaheim Stadium's $21-million 
operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the negotiations say the deal was killed by Rams officials, 
who want to be absolved of the team's obligation to restore the school site to 
its original condition when the team vacates the property. It is an obligation 
the team had agreed to when it moved to Anaheim, according to city and district 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the team believes the city may be responsible for part of the 
restoration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials on Wednesday said they are hopeful that a lease agreement for 
the practice site will be reached before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 To many people in the city, the machinations around the practice site lease 
are further proof that the Rams will leave Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rams' stadium lease expires in 2015, the city agreed to add an 
escape clause in 1990 to settle a lawsuit brought by the team concerning the 
construction of the Anaheim Arena. It is a concession that the city now 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he remains optimistic that the team can be persuaded to stay in 
Anaheim.

<P>
 Currently, city officials are looking at options to improve Anaheim Stadium 
and offer the team other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Orange County investors are also exploring the possibility of 
purchasing majority ownership of the team, though Rams owner Georgia Frontiere 
has said that will not happen. Meanwhile, the Rams Booster Club has asked the 
business community to step up and buy season tickets to increase attendance and 
Rams revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercier, however, said the district, for one, is tired of catering to the 
Rams' every whim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at Disney and the way they reach out to the community with the Ducks 
and try to give something back to the city," Mercier said, " . . . and then I 
look over in the other direction and see the Rams fighting for every last inch 
of property, giving nothing back to the city and just wanting to take."

SEX HARASSMENT REMAINS TOUGH LAPD PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Despite years of increasingly pointed warnings and mounting legal challenges, 
sexual harassment at the Los Angeles Police Department remains an entrenched 
and serious problem, according to documents and numerous police officials who 
say there is a climate of hostility toward women that has until recently gone 
virtually unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records, internal police documents and interviews with police officers, 
supervisors and department critics reveal a number of cases of alleged 
harassment: from a sexually explicit computer program left in the terminals of 
female officers, to supervisors who press subordinates for dates, to three 
pending lawsuits involving claims that officers raped colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment of female officers takes on additional urgency because the 
department's top leaders believe women, who generally get high marks for 
avoiding excessive-force complaints, are a key component of the LAPD's 
much-vaunted plan to bring community-based policing to the city. Moreover, the 
LAPD is vigorously trying to hire more female officers to satisfy legal 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment is not unique to the LAPD, which like many organizations is 
trying to come to terms with new and sometimes misunderstood definitions of the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar complaints and lawsuits have surfaced in several Orange County police 
departments, including Anaheim, Orange, Newport Beach and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Some male officers in the LAPD, especially longtime veterans, say they feel 
that the rules have been changed in the middle of the game -- that they 
suddenly are being threatened with punishment for conduct that would have been 
laughed about just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to expect that when you go from one culture to another, from 
all-male to a mixture, that you're going to have some difficulties," said Judy 
Rosener, a professor at the UC Irvine graduate school of management. "We're 
playing new roles, but we don't have new rules. A lot of police officers don't 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League has looked at the issue from both sides, 
representing in separate cases men accused of sexual harassment and women 
complaining of it. "In a male-dominated profession, there was not enough 
education in preparation for women coming into the ranks. . . . That has 
created some problems, but we're talking about a small percentage of our 
officers," said the union's president, Danny L. Staggs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the LAPD attempts to tackle the problem, many credit Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams with taking important steps in the right direction. They are 
particularly heartened by the chief's decision to authorize a sweeping sexual 
harassment audit at the LAPD's West Los Angeles station, some details of which 
were first reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very clear that this administration without any shadow of a doubt 
is going to create a different environment for women in this department," 
Williams said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum, who has enthusiastically backed 
Williams' attempts to attack harassment in the ranks, said it may take time to 
change the attitudes of a relatively small but entrenched number of officers 
who have yet to comprehend the importance of the issue. But he stressed that 
Williams has begun to turn the department around. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the LAPD is wrestling with dozens of complaints. According to 
public files and internal documents obtained by The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the past five years, there have been at least eight cases of female LAPD 
employees alleging that they were sexually assaulted by co-workers. There have 
been no criminal prosecutions. Three incidents are the subject of current 
Internal Affairs investigations. Three others are the subject of pending 
lawsuits: In one case the accused officer was fired after an in-house hearing, 
while the other two suits were filed after the accused officers were cleared by 
internal disciplinary boards. In another case, an officer was allowed to resign 
before the case was adjudicated internally. Still another resulted in a 1990 
lawsuit that was settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 * The LAPD logged 43 "gender-related personnel complaints" against police 
officers last year. Five were alleged assaults, four involved "inappropriate 
pictures/photos/video," and seven involved touching. In 25 cases, officers were 
accused of making inappropriate comments and in two cases officers were accused 
of both touching and commenting inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite reports calling attention to the problem, until last year the LAPD 
never compiled records of sexual harassment cases. Instead, the cases were 
included with other allegations under broad headings such as conduct unbecoming 
an officer. "I'm not willing to say (the data) was purposely buried, but 
certainly nobody cared to keep track," said City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, 
who chairs the council's Personnel Committee. "It was not important enough. 
That is what it tells me." 
</P>
<P>
 * In the last several years, the city of Los Angeles has spent more than 
$400,000 settling 11 sexual harassment cases -- six involving the LAPD. Another 
dozen or so cases are pending and at least three major law firms have notified 
the city that they intend to file additional sexual harassment lawsuits against 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 1,100 women officers on the department -- about 15% of the 
7,600 total. Some critics of department attitudes say harassment will not be 
erased until the number of women in the department comes closer to the 44% in 
the general work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's historic indifference has created a culture of acquiescence among 
many female LAPD officers, who say they have silently put up with harassment 
rather than fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned it's better to shut up and not do anything," said one 10-year LAPD 
veteran who said she put up with harassment for years before resigning in 1993 
and ultimately winning a $50,000 settlement from the city. "If you say 
something, you create enemies. . . . There's going to be some type of 
retaliation, whether it's your peers or your supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some female officers say they do not have confidence that the 
LAPD's Internal Affairs Division will fairly handle their complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 All of that has left many female officers discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it as a normal part of work relations," said one officer who has 
worked for the LAPD for six years and who asked that her name not be used. "I 
think everyone thinks it's really not a problem until something really blatant 
happens to them or someone else they know. Then you start thinking back. When I 
started thinking back about all I had gone through, I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most serious accusations are the cases in which police officers are 
accused of sexually assaulting their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Department sources and others say there have been at least eight such 
allegations leveled against LAPD officers in the last five years. Two of the 
cases were disposed of, one when a lawsuit was settled out of court, the other 
when the accused officer was allowed to resign. But six incidents still are 
being contested, either within the department or in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three cases currently under internal LAPD review, one is based on an 
allegation that a police officer raped a colleague with his gun. The other two, 
sources say, involve police officers who allegedly forced subordinates to have 
sex with them in return for favorable treatment at work. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer who is suing said she had been partying at the Los Angeles Police 
Academy on Sept. 8, 1990; by her own admission, she drank too much that night. 
As some of her friends were leaving, she ducked into a women's restroom to 
vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her lawsuit, Officer Ernest Hill took advantage of her 
predicament to rape her while she was hunched over the toilet. On Oct. 16, 
three weeks after the incident, she filed a complaint with Internal Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting an investigation, the Internal Affairs officer recommended 
that Hill be sent to a Board of Rights, the LAPD's chief disciplinary body. But 
on Jan. 28, 1991, then-Chief Daryl F. Gates dismissed the charges against Hill 
because he was advised that a board would be unlikely to reach a conclusion 
because there were no other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfied, the female officer continued to press the department to take 
action against Hill. In late 1991, the matter was ordered to a trial board. The 
internal charges against Hill were sustained and he was removed from the 
department. His case, like the four others that have completed the internal 
LAPD disciplinary process, was referred to the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office; no officers were prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's attorney did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A second case cited in a lawsuit also began with a party at the Police Academy 
on May 29, 1991, where the woman met an officer of the LAPD's elite Metro 
Division. According to her lawsuit, the officer offered her a ride home. She 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, she says that the male officer asked to come in, and she let him. 
According to her, he left to move his car a short time later. She believed he 
had gone for the evening, so she went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few minutes later, defendant . . . re-entered (her) home, without her 
knowledge or permission," the suit against him and the LAPD asserts. "After 
returning to (her) home, and despite (her) repeated demands that he stop, 
defendant . . . forcibly sexually assaulted" her. 
</P>
<P>
 The female officer has not worked full time since 1991 and says in her suit 
that she is suffering from a stress-related heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The male officer, in a closed hearing, was found not guilty by a department 
Board of Rights. He remains on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The male officer's lawyer, Robert E. Kelly Jr., said his client is an innocent 
victim who spurned the woman's advances. "Harassment may be a problem (at the 
Police Department)," Kelly said, "but my client is not part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The third pending court case in which sexual abuse is alleged involves a 
rank-and-file officer and one of the department's top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1992, the female officer allegedly asked a high-ranking LAPD 
official for some advice. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason -- attorneys on each side offer conflicting explanations -- 
the two officers agreed to meet at the man's apartment after work. Once there, 
according to the female officer's lawsuit, the man threw her on a bed, pinned 
her down and raped her. She contends that as she lay weeping beneath him, the 
male officer said: "I am an old man, this will not take too long." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his attorney, Barry Levin, the male officer admits having sex 
with the woman but denies that he raped her. An LAPD Board of Rights, in a 
closed hearing, cleared him of wrongdoing last year. Her suit against him and 
the department goes to trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rape cases are by far the most serious allegations of sexual impropriety 
by LAPD officers against their colleagues. But there are scores of other 
complaints scattered throughout that department and others, including several 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, four Orange County police departments received such complaints. 
Four non-sworn female employees of the Anaheim Police Department accused a 
sergeant of sexually harassing them, which provoked an internal investigation. 
The results were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Police Department fired three officers for alleged sexual 
misconduct with civilians, and was sued by a former employee who charged sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten current or former female members of the Newport Beach Police Department 
filed a sexual harassment suit against the department and two officers, a 
lawsuit that some of the former employees settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Irvine police chief is being sued by four female officers for alleged 
sexual discrimination. In a separate complaint, an internal investigation 
conducted by the department found "absolutely no evidence" that officers had 
sex with women in the back seat of patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a former San Clemente police officer was sentenced to seven years in 
prison for raping a colleague on the force and sexually assaulting another 
women. Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter described the 
officer, David Wayne Bryan, as "a person who was running amok." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the harassment in the Los Angeles Police Department seems merely 
juvenile: In the late 1980s, a computer program of two people having sex began 
making the rounds in the department. Male officers would occasionally leave a 
disk with the program in the terminal of a female counterpart, along with a 
note suggesting that the female officer call up "Parkme," the name of the 
program. When she did, the crude graphic would appear on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, the alleged harassment gets more personal, according to a 
variety of pending civil lawsuits: 
</P>
<P>
 Take Cynthia Juarez, who complained in 1987 that she was subjected to "lewd 
remarks and conduct" -- including those from a colleague who allegedly shook 
her shoulders to make her breasts shake. Or Alicia Robalino, a civilian 
employee who said that after she broke off an affair with a co-worker, he 
launched a campaign against her, following her home, breaking into her 
apartment and at one point throwing her from a moving car. Or the woman 
identified in court papers only as "Jane Doe," who filed suit last year against 
the LAPD after a homicide detective named Carlos Brizzolara allegedly made 
sexually explicit remarks to her, asked her out on dates and, on one occasion, 
pushed her head toward his lap as she bent over to retrieve a napkin in a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Another officer who witnessed the restaurant incident told an LAPD Board of 
Rights that the female officer jerked her head up and said, "Cut it out." 
Brizzolara, according to the female officer and the witness, explained his 
actions by saying: "I thought that's what you wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Rights cleared Brizzolara of sexual harassment as a result of 
that incident -- but not because it doubted that the incident actually 
occurred. The Board called Brizzolara's conduct totally inappropriate, while at 
the same time declining to find him guilty because, in its words, there was "no 
evidence of sexual gratification or sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was among those dissatisfied by that board's work, and he ordered a 
second board to review a second set of sexual harassment allegations against 
Brizzolara; that time, Brizzolara, who through his lawyer on Wednesday denied 
any wrongdoing, was found guilty on eight of 11 charges. He is appealing, and a 
judge has ordered the LAPD to grant him yet another Board of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the initial board ruling argued that sexual gratification is not a 
legal element of harassment. If it were, legal experts note, men could 
effectively harass women and then plead innocence by saying they did not enjoy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I tell people about that ruling, they laugh out loud," said Carol Sobel, 
an ACLU lawyer who is handling the female officer's lawsuit along with many 
others brought by alleged harassment victims. "No one can believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment and discrimination in the Police Department were highlighted 
by a series of reports in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, internal LAPD studies found that more than 75% of female police 
officers said they had been the subjects of sexist comments from colleagues on 
the job. Seven out of 10 female officers said they did not believe they were 
judged based on their abilities, and more than half told investigators that 
they had male partners who made unjustifiably negative remarks about their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Those reports were reviewed by the top supervisors of the department. But in 
1991, the Christopher Commission concluded that nothing had been done in 
response to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the commission said the department was riddled with "widespread 
and strongly felt gender bias." Its report cited interviews with training 
officers and excerpts from "blatantly sexist messages" sent over LAPD 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attempt to address the difficulties faced by female police officers 
came last fall, when the Women's Advisory Council to the Police Commission 
completed its study of women in the department and warned that significant 
problems remained. Since then, its authors have hailed a few steps by Chief 
Williams, but they say more aggressive action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This audit is the first thing that they have really done," said Katherine 
Spillar, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and a co-chair of the 
Women's Advisory Council. "But this is a problem that has gone unaddressed for 
years. Sexual harassment has been sanctioned by the leadership of this 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Problems and perceptions of gender bias and sexual harassment in the 
department have altered working relationships, imposing new standards on a 
traditionally male work force as women have broken into new areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some male officers complain that they are being held to politically correct 
standards of behavior even as some female officers worry that their tolerance 
of inappropriate conduct has inadvertently encouraged that conduct to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people who are blatant harassers and have been for years and years," 
said Sgt. Carol Aborn, who has been with the LAPD for more than 10 years and is 
a former president of the Los Angeles Women's Police Officers Assn. "Nothing 
has been done about them for all that time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the far-flung reaches of the LAPD, there are a few areas that some women 
say they have learned to dread. Chief among them is the West Los Angeles 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, West Los Angeles was home to a pair of informal groups of 
male officers: The first called itself PALS -- short for "Police Against Lousy 
Supervision." It was followed by creation of a second, MAW, an acronym for "Men 
Against Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Some male officers who knew of the groups say they were merely jokes, that no 
genuine hostility was directed either at supervisors or at women. But after 
previous investigations turned up little, the LAPD last year launched what 
department sources say is the most aggressive effort it has ever undertaken to 
root out the problem of sexual harassment in the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting last fall, a lieutenant and three detectives began pulling West Los 
Angeles officers aside and conducting interviews to assess the working 
conditions at the station. What emerged from four months of that process and 
more than 100 interviews, according to department ources, was a 
still-unreleased portrait of a police station beset by harassment: of officers 
who openly disparaged the abilities of their female counterparts, of training 
officers who would go for an entire shift with barely a word spoken to their 
female trainee, of openly racist and sexist remarks and, in at least a few 
instances, of male officers failing to come to the aid of females. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would get in a patrol car and the fellow would lean over and say, 'I don't 
want to hear from you. I don't believe you belong here. Just sit there and be 
quiet,' " said one female LAPD officer who worked at West Los Angeles in the 
mid-1980s. "And that's just what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, two veteran officers, Stephen McNicholas and Jay A. Varga, have been 
transferred out of West Los Angeles. A personnel complaint obtained by The 
Times last month accused the pair of making sexist remarks and of failing to 
come to the aid of female officers on two separate occasions. Department 
sources say Internal Affairs now is investigating whether to bring internal 
charges against those two officers, both of whom vehemently deny any 
wrongdoing. Those same sources say that other officers and their supervisors 
also are under investigation to determine whether they created or tolerated a 
working environment hostile to women. 
</P>
<P>
 At West Los Angeles, some officers accuse LAPD management of orchestrating a 
"witch hunt," against McNicholas and Varga under the guise of a management 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what gets described as sexual harassment is really just sniveling," 
said one male West Los Angeles officer who asked not to be identified. 
"Management is just trying to punish Jay and Steve. The rest of this is just a 
smoke screen."

pork and onion. Place beans on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring 1 quart water to boil in saucepan. Add garlic, tomato puree, salt, 
pepper, dried mustard, maple sugar, molasses, bay leaves and vinegar. Simmer 1 
minute. Mix well and pour over beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Score strips of salt pork crosswise, about every inch, without cutting 
through. This prevents strips from curling while cooking. Place strips on top 
of beans and liquid. Cover pot and bake at 250 degrees 5 hours, checking 
occasionally (first at 2 hours, then every hour), to be sure liquid is just 
barely covering beans. Add more water as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 After 5 hours, remove cover of bean pot and cook 1 hour more. Remove strips of 
salt pork and stir pot before serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

 Each serving contains about:

carbohydrates; 21 grams protein; 5.15 grams fiber.
