WHO IS TO BLAME?; A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE WAR CRIMES OF THE 20TH CENTURY EXAMINES 
BOTH THE HAZARDS AND URGENCY OF HONESTY; THE WAGES OF GUILT: MEMORIES OF WAR IN 
GERMANY AND JAPAN, BY IAN BURUMA (FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $25; 330 PP.)

By William H. Gass, William H. Gass is a novelist and critic and the director 
of the International Writers Center at Washington University in St. Louis. Due 
out next year is his novel The Tunnel, the fictionalized memoir of a historian 
sympathetic to the Nazi regime.

 The shameful memory market, where Ian Buruma's remarkable book takes us, has 
many stalls. Perhaps there has been in the whole of history no more murderous 
an age, no period more productive of pain -- of death, dislocation and despair 
-- than our own century. Our civilization has found new ways to go mad, 
contrived fresh methods of mass destruction, gone to wars as if wars were 
parties, and created several calamities to signal that it has outdone nature's 
most glamorous disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, like the plume of the Bomb, guilt's contamination grows. 
Commencing at ground zero, the guilty are, first, those who did it ; second, 
those who ordered it done; third, those who made possible its doing; fourth, 
those who proposed it ; fifth, those who justified it ; sixth, those who 
applauded it ; seventh, those who profited from it ; eighth, those whose job it 
was to obscure and deny it ; ninth, those who knew about it but did nothing; 
tenth, those who did not know of it but ought to have known; and if it is the 
dropping of the Bomb, or if it is the rape of Nanking, or if it is the loss of 
World War I or II, or the Holocaust it self, then perhaps it may be that even 
the children of the guilty are guilty, that groups are guilty, that races, 
nations, languages should bear the blame (the victims are guiltiest of all), or 
if you wish to go that far, that man himself -- man's cruel character and evil 
nature -- is at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much that is painful to remember, our period is one in which 
forgetting is fundamental; yet, paradoxically, we occupy a time when most news 
travels in a flash, and bad news in a blink. To cover our ears and comfort our 
conscience, we have learned to make noise, for in the din our attention can 
wander. 
</P>
<P>
 In this examination of the very different ways in which Germany and Japan have 
dealt with the legacy of World War II, Buruma makes clear and distinct the 
voices that make up this babble. By moving back and forth between the tender 
memory centers in these countries -- Auschwitz, Hiroshima, and Nanking -- and 
by concentrating on the courtroom with its judgments and defenses, the 
schoolroom with its textbooks and official explanations, and the museum with 
its "educational" displays, he allows us to distinguish one excuse from 
another, to catch an accusation here, a confession there -- through the usual 
stages of denial, explanation and counterclaim, sordid and shameful 
recollection, recognition and acceptance. But he also permits us to review, 
like a regiment, long ranks of resentment, to listen to blame played as if by a 
brass band, to observe how the Left's wings flap from side to side to keep the 
Right's from flight, while the Right's wings fold to bring the whole bird down. 
Like a technician, he separates the sounds so we can hear the huckstering of 
horrors, too, as countless anxious interests try to clear the air, clean the 
slate, escape or confront that demon -- truth -- while making a profit, gaining 
an advantage for their policies, justifying the punishments they are about to 
inflict on their enemies, maintaining their moral superiority and fond 
self-regard. 
</P>
<P>
 To follow the fate of the memories of atrocity and defeat in Germany and 
Japan, Buruma monitors the media, does his local history homework, attends the 
theater, reads novelists, visits sites, memorials and museums, and conducts 
numerous interviews with as many participants and whistle-blowers and 
apologists as will speak to him. He draws them out wonderfully, often with 
painfully paradoxical results, as was the case with Azuma Shiro, an 81-year-old 
veteran of the Japanese Imperial Army who had come forward to embarrass the 
regime with an account of the behavior of Japanese soldiers during the Invasion 
of China. Women were raped as a matter of course, and then killed lest they 
bear witness rather than bastards; rape, after all, was against military 
regulations. Since Azuma was suffering from a venereal disease at the time, he 
abstained, a restraint whose point might pass many of us by in view of the 
murders which concealed the crime. One has to wonder, as well, if the women 
might have been spared their lives had the army had no such rule against rape, 
but rather had advised its soldiers to have fun, fornicate and bring shame to 
the families of their enemies, as the Serbs seem to have intended. 
</P>
<P>
 And who is more guilty: the bureaucrat who signed the order, or the camp guard 
who herded the allegedly infested to the showers? Is it praiseworthy to have 
distanced yourself from your acts by letting George do it when what George does 
is to assault a helpless naked woman in the mud she will be murdered in? Is it 
more villainous to have fashioned a fine blade, or to have used it to 
decapitate an enemy? To have pondered the most efficient way to burn stacks of 
bodies, or to have stacked and burned them according to the most efficient way? 
To have bottled nerve gas or invented it? To have flown the Enola Gray or 
chalked some braggish insult on the side of the Bomb? 
</P>
<P>
 Questions . . . questions . . . how they continue. Are the books I read before 
I marched patriotically off to battle to be blamed? Are authoritarian parents 
part of it? Love of church or country? Is romantic music responsible? 
Obscurantist philosophy? A feudal history? And there is always the runaway 
consequences of unbridled power. Guilty all, maybe, Cain included, though not 
guilty equally or in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the war is over, the camps are closed, the soldiers have come home, 
from the homes they've burned, to happy hearths and loving wives. Normality 
needs to be restored. Pride needs to be regained. Why dwell on the 
disagreeable? Let us go forward into a financially fine future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wages of Guilt" is dotted with vivid accounts of the hatred and 
harassment endured by both Germans and Japanese who have persisted in the 
pursuit of unpleasant truths. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buruma does not exonerate even these truth seekers, for he understands how 
condemning people can turn into a great sport. Hoist on a newly won piety, we 
can hide our own bad acts behind the crimes of others. The responsibility for 
our presently unpleasant state lies elsewhere than ourselves: A ruler we once 
thought divine is to blame; a general of unimpeachable character and skills 
proved cowardly and stupid; a weapon of unheard-of horror did us in; and we 
were, of course, lied to by everybody, by our judges and priests and teachers 
and leaders and gods. The East Germans pulled this off perfectly for a while, 
calling themselves Communists and continuing to live like Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it must not happen again. We shall rub every nose in it . It must never 
be forgotten. Remember the Maine, the Alamo, Pearl Harbor. War crimes trials 
are of great educational value, because they bring the truth to light and let 
it be known. They do? Or are they forums of propaganda -- vindictive, 
self-serving and self-righteous? Who is to try whom, anyway? Do any deserve to 
escape whipping? Put Dresden with Hiroshima and add Nagasaki to the pot, and 
you get deeds about as dastardly as deeds get. Perhaps we can trade our imp of 
Satan for your Instrument of the Devil, even-steven? Who's to blame if all of 
us are? 
</P>
<P>
 The first generation (who were involved in it and dirtied by it) desires to 
forget. Destroy the camps, clean up the countryside, rebuild the cities, fail 
to mention this or that when telling its story, if its story has to be told at 
all. The second generation, however, wants to remember. The children do not 
wish to be soiled by the sins of their -- for the most part -- fathers. Perhaps 
a camp can become a museum; perhaps a ruined church can serve as its own 
memorial stone; perhaps classes in former crimes can be held, movies shown, 
days of devotion set aside. During one of those moments of memory, however, 
consider why Hegel invented the dialectic. After "forget!" after "remember!" 
comes "revise!" 
</P>
<P>
 A new lawn would look nice around the crematorium. Not everyone was evil, 
either: How about the heroic resistance? There have been holocausts before. 
Remember what the Romans did to Carthage? We need to recruit better Buchenwald 
girl guides. After all, Buchenwald is an East German shrine where many a 
Communist martyr died. It is also a camp the Soviets kept open until 1950 in 
order to punish a fresh set of enemies. We deny, for the time being, that the 
Imperial Japanese Army forced Korean women into prostitution. We also deny the 
existence of Chinese slave labor in Japan, and if there were such camps they 
were necessary, and if the Chinese were badly treated, it was because they 
tried to run away. These "truths," which the Left has so heedlessly embraced, 
disgrace the memory of our glorious soldiers and sailors, especially the 
Kamikaze pilots, whose sacrifices should never be vilified, even if they were 
in vain, and even if there is no special realm where they now recline in 
comfort. You think we were bad, what about you guys? 
</P>
<P>
 Our guide Buruma is not without his opinions, but what makes him exemplary in 
this regard is his ability to see the strengths as well as the weaknesses in 
varying points of view. Nor does he wag his finger and say "shame" all the 
time. He is mapping our maneuvers, noting the secret reasons for our public 
principles, understanding the hazards of honesty as well as its urgency. To 
escape the blame, the pain, the pursuit of Furies, the mind will make excuses, 
contrive a rescuing metaphysic, rewrite history as though it were a play being 
tested out of town, and place on its face a melancholy look, or one of ignorant 
innocence, whatever will seem to work. Perhaps it will do to appear serenely 
indifferent, or to assume a studious and calm concern as though examining 
sickly plants. Failing that, murder more or go mad. 
</P>
<P>
 You accuse me of leaving the toilet seat up? Well, you never turn off a light. 
You Yanks want to bring up a few rapes by aggrieved and frightened Japanese 
soldiers when your country cindered an entire city with one bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 If most of us are eager to evade blame, why are a few so willing to accept it? 
Mea culpa is not the name of a red convertible. But suppose I wish to call 
myself a German because I think in that way I can bring Bach and Goethe, Durer 
and Brahms, nearer to my soul. Does Himmler move in too, with all his friends? 
One tongue tastes sour and sweet with equal ease: The language of Heine and 
Hitler was the same, if not their style of speech. If I wish to claim the 
glories of my culture and argue that they live on to some degree in me, how 
much of the other, the it , must I admit I also am? The desire on the part of 
many liberal young Germans to face the truth of their history, to resolve that 
it, in any form or version, shall not happen again (fine as these sentiments do 
indeed seem), nevertheless suggests that tribalism still holds them in thrall, 
and that nationalism still pulls at their sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if one treats the Holocaust as a part of the course of history, 
then it loses its almost holy status; it will have causes and explanations, and 
these can bear the blame and become its justification. On the other hand, if 
the Holocaust is regarded as unique, inexplicable, then nothing prepared its 
coming; no one can assure us it will not occur again; it is like a 
counter-miracle; and who can be blamed for being caught up in such an unnatural 
catastrophe and swept away? 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Buruma's book is a catalogue of such quandaries. Offering no solutions, 
making no predictions, it simply gives us a picture of the moral climate. While 
Buruma's focus is war crimes in Japan and Germany, moral climates travel the 
globe. There are brief periods of arrogant heyday followed by oppressive 
humidity, disillusion, shame and gloom. He concludes on a cautiously hopeful 
note, which I wish I could qualmlessly enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 I firmly believe that an ideal life would be one lived without illusions, but 
disillusionment also grows old. We tire of being wise and of constantly 
creeping to conclusions. We weary of being sane and seeing life as a long slow 
slide of sorrow. So former lies are likely to be welcome once again, in their 
fashionable and glossy get-ups. Goat glands couldn't make us feel better than 
injections of fresh falsehood. Give us a moment to throw a little ritual dust 
in our eyes; then we'll sally forth to live a little, mouth slogans, raise 
Cain, sin some and get in trouble.

 Mary Williams Walsh's "War and Remembrance" (May 22) must strike a chord in 
anyone who has tried to communicate with a father who, though loved, remains 
mysterious. The piece captures in a natural, understated way the connection -- 
and lack of connection -- between the generations. The backdrop of Normandy 
makes more poignant her perception that "life doesn't work out like an Italian 
opera."

 Thank you for "War and Remembrance," a warm and touching story. As a 
70-year-old veteran of the World War II battles of the South Pacific, and as 
the father of an equally wonderful, loving daughter, I was quite moved by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps such splendid, kind and caring children are our greatest victory for 
the service we performed in that war.

 My unit, as did Thomas Edward Walsh's, sailed across the English Channel to Le 
Havre to reach the battlefields of France. In late December, 1944, during the 
Battle of the Bulge, I was captured and taken to a German prisoner-of-war camp 
near Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
 Discouraged and hungry, I took a walk one morning up to the main gate of the 
camp. Suddenly, the loudspeaker burst forth with a phonograph recording of Bing 
Crosby singing Irving Berlin's "Blue Skies." When I heard Bing's marvelous 
voice, my morale perked up and I knew then I could make it through to the end 
of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 After we were liberated, our packed American troopship sailed across the 
Atlantic and entered New York Harbor. In the distance, I could see the uplifted 
torch on the arm of the Statue of Liberty. It's a memory I will never forget.

 Reading "War and Remembrance" stirred memories for me. I, too, was at Norfolk 
House, only I was there in October, 1942, before the North Africa landings, and 
in January, 1944. I was a stenographer and typed many of the planning papers 
for Operation Overlord. 
</P>
<P>
 My recollections of the buzz-bomb terror over London are vivid. I counted 70 
flying over the city in one day. Once a bomb landed in the street near our 
quarters in the Sloane Square area. It hit just at breakfast call, when many of 
the staff were boarding trucks to go eat. More than 50 were killed. I was 
fortunate in that I was on my way out but had not left the building.

 Just a minor correction in "War and Remembrance." The Mauretania, not 
Mauritania, was built for Cunard White Star by Cammel Laird and requisitioned 
for government service in 1940. It was named after an ancient district from 
Roman times that included most of the present northern Morocco and western 
Algeria. This was not the same as the modern Mauritania of northwest Africa.

HE SHE WE; READING STONEWALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In Robb Forman Dew's "The Family Heart: A Memoir of When Our Son Came Out" 
(Addison Wesley) the novelist and her professor husband are surprised and not a 
little embarrassed by their own lack of knowledge about what being gay is all 
about. Although they counted lesbians and gay men among their friends and 
believed themselves unprejudiced against gay people, they found their son's 
coming out not only a shock to their family's emotional system, but to their 
own knowledge of the world. Nobody reading this remarkable and affecting book 
will forget the images of confusion -- the novelist's thought that they should 
pack up and move to San Francisco, the two parents in bed in that revelatory 
summer, he planning railroad trips they did not intend to take, she stringing 
enough popcorn decorations for a dozen Christmas trees. As Robb Forman Dew 
found out, we are in your lives and yet you don't really know much about us. 
That self-imposed ignorance is not benign but consequential. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25th anniversary of Stonewall is an ideal occasion for readers to remedy 
their own lack of information. The little rebellion at a gay bar in Greenwich 
Village, where the bar's patrons, many of them drag queens an other 
"disreputable" types, resisted routine police repression, was not the first 
time gays fought back, nor were gay bars the only places where gays and 
lesbians resisted society's repression. What made Stonewall a turning point was 
that its resistance spread to the streets, and subsequent spread of that from 
there into the public mind. 
</P>
<P>
 While some might question Stonewall's status as a revolutionary event, few 
would question its significance as a cultural event. Whatever else it signaled, 
Stonewall symbolizes the emergence of an openly lesbian and gay public literary 
culture. Lesbian and gay committees of correspondence fueled the consciousness 
of the movements for homosexual liberation. It was through literature 
(Melville, Wilde, Whitman and Stein, as well as that literature locked in 
library stacks or under the counters of newsstands) that significant numbers of 
gays began to understand themselves and one another and construct the secret 
histories that have sustained them. To read was the way gays could try making 
sense of feelings the culture in general still insists that they ignore, deny 
and change. 
</P>
<P>
 To write, as it happens, was an equal imperative. There has always been a 
special affinity of lesbians and gay men for the work of culture. Some have 
seen this as the gay "office" in society. But gay writing was itself a danger. 
It was his letters that convicted Oscar Wilde, and the necessity for literary 
codes, pseudonyms and the resources of the samidzat characterized pre-Stonewall 
gay writing. Stonewall 25 reminds us of the vital and voluminous writing and 
publishing about lesbian and gay lives and concerns, not only by the small gay 
presses and feminist presses that have always sustained lesbian and gay writing 
but by the university and commercial presses that have come to recognize the 
large readership for works by and about gays, as the publishers of the titles 
discussed below indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The development of a lesbian and gay scholarship from all disciplines and 
quarters, not just the university (and not only from gay individuals) has been 
a striking post-Stonewall development. George Chauncey's "Gay New York: Gender, 
Urban Culture and the Making of the Gay Male World 1890-1940" (Basic Books) is 
a landmark gay history of the city that hosted the largest and most various gay 
life, not to mention the Stonewall incident itself (which Chauncey's projected 
second volume will cover) and with Los Angeles and San Francisco cradled the 
gay movement. Chauncey argues that the very phenomenon of Stonewall and the 
contemporary lesbian and gay liberation movement have made us blind to the size 
and variety of gay life before World War II. He identifies three myths of gay 
life, that gays were isolated, that gays were invisible and that they 
internalized society's prejudices against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Chauncey's study of the great metropolis interestingly complements "Boots of 
Leather, Slippers of Gold" (Routledge) Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy's and 
Madeline D. Davis's history of the lesbian working class community in Buffalo. 
Drawing on oral history as well as records, the authors have represented a 
microcosmic study of a fascinating and vital community. The importance of class 
and race and the techniques of survival in the face of oppression marked the 
historical experience of these women. Kennedy and Davis have written about the 
specific local development of a consciousness of kind that is required for a 
liberations movement and that they show existed before Stonewall in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo lesbian community is the setting for one of the year's most 
powerful novels, "Stone Butch Blues" (Firebrand Books) by Leslie Feinberg. This 
extraordinary story of Jess, a he-she growing up in a blue collar city in the 
1950s, coming out into factories and gay bars in the early '60s and deciding to 
pass as a man in order to survive, recaptures the essential experience of the 
lesbian (or gay man) whose nature is perceived by society as somehow unnatural. 
The coincidence of these two explorations of lesbian experience in the same 
city and the same historical period is itself an important marker. Kennedy and 
Davis, for instance, show how the "cleaning up" of the Buffalo police in the 
early '60s had the effect of making the lesbian community more vulnerable to 
police repression, a repression Feinberg's Jess experiences unforgettably in 
"Stone Butch Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 A key function of gay studies has been to recover the gay cultural past. No 
serious readers can doubt any more that the gay sexual orientation of Walt 
Whitman or Henry James, Gertrude Stein or Willa Cather, of Cole Porter or 
Countee Cullen, etc., played a significant part in their lives and (in most 
cases) in their work; the discussion has profitably been shifted to how and 
where sexual orientation, like race, gender and reading, is reflected in art. 
Whitman, for instance, has been shown by such scholars as Michael Moon 
("Disseminating Whitman," Harvard University Press) to have been guided by a 
variety of concerns related to what we would call his sexual orientation in the 
revision of "Leaves of Grass." Gay and lesbian studies have been the occasion 
for powerful reconsiderations of the traditions of western literary and 
cultural expression. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's collection of essays, "Tendencies" 
(Duke University Press) continues her excavation of what lies at the heart of 
western culture and gives a virtuosic example of how contemporary theory can 
discover new worlds in the familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 A striking example of lesbian and gay scholarly activism is a new anthology of 
"The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology" edited by Philip Brett, Elizabeth Wood and 
Gary C. Thomas. The essays in "Queering the Pitch" (Routledge) take all manner 
of approaches to discover what being lesbian and gay has to do with being 
musical an old code word for being homosexual. Thomas' "Was George Frederick 
Handel Gay: On Closet Questions and Cultural Politics" and Susan McClary's 
"Constitution of Subjectivity in Schubert's Music" show how the question of a 
composer's homosexuality forms an essential part in understanding the music. 
Phillip Brett's essay on "Eros and Orientalism in Britten's Operas" and his 
powerful essay "Music Essentialism, and the Closet" define the challenge that 
this particular collection and the gay studies impulse in general present to 
cultural complacency and how much we all have to gain as listeners, readers and 
people from it. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial example of gay scholarship of the moment is the 
extraordinary book by historian John Boswell, "Same Sex Unions in PreModern 
Europe" (Villard Books). Boswell's research has yielded the texts of liturgies 
from medieval Europe that he believes indicate church solemnizing of "the 
same-sex equivalent of a medieval heterosexual marriage ceremony (though not 
necessarily a precise equivalent of its modern descendants.)" His book is 
meticulous, evidence based, well written and above all scholarly. Boswell makes 
the texts he has discovered available to the reader in a detailed context that 
not only supports his own interpretation but gives the attentive reader grounds 
to make an independent judgment. The heated response to news of the book shows 
how resistant many people still are to the possibility that history might 
subvert contemporary prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading Stonewall means also reading the novels, plays, poems, autobiographies 
and essays that abound in contemporary literature. AIDS has been the occasion 
of an extraordinary amount of important writing, the occasion of great 
suffering, tremendous losses to the literary community and of striking 
creativity that can only be suggested here. Terry Wolverton's "Blood Whispers: 
LA Writers on AIDS Vol. 2" (Silverton Books, The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian 
Community Services Center) includes such writers as Luis Alfaro, Eloise Klein 
Healy, James Carroll Pickett, David Vernon and Ms. Wolverton herself. Paul 
Monette's new collection, "Last Watch of the Night" (Harcourt Brace) continues 
this talented and perceptive writer's reports from the front in a world that 
AIDS has transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Wayne Kostenbaum's extraordinary "The Queens Throat: Opera, 
Homosexuality and the Mystery of Desire" (Vintage) refashioned the traditional 
gay male partiality for the opera, and especially its divas, into an amazing 
book. His new book of poetry, "Rhapsodies of a Repeat Offender" (Persea) 
continues his passion, in common with that of other lesbian and gay writers, to 
express in new forms and especially in a free and open way, passions and 
interests that had been coded before. Kostenbaum's poems signify the 
replacement of hitherto secret codes with something more than telling the 
secrets, with literature. He refigures the gay response to its icons in post 
Stonewall terms: "Once, Garbo was whispering secrets of performance/in a 
bandaged voice, and I was listening, and no toxins in the field/of vision arose 
to violate the soliloquy, unfolding/with the tranquility of all final 
compositions." 
</P>
<P>
 In her new book, lesbian novelist Katherine Forest addresses another 
sustaining imperative of Stonewall writing. "Flashpoint" (Naiad) is a political 
novel in the honorable tradition of American political writing. Several lesbian 
and gay friends gather at a mountain cabin in anticipation of Governor Pete 
Wilson's shabby veto in 1991 of a gay rights bill he had promised to sign. In 
the course of this honest and resonant book the stories of lesbian and gay life 
in America, the intertwining of survival skills with the horror of what made 
living into surviving, become the focus of individuality and community, sharing 
and dispute. Like Stonewall itself, as a historical event, a commemorative 
celebration and now a literary event, "Flashpoint" understands and insists that 
it is in relation to freedom and to coming out that lesbian and gay people 
define themselves. It is in this sense above all that Stonewall resonates and 
probably always will.

 I would like to clarify a point in the article "Speed Demon" (by Peter 
McAlevey, May 22) which said that Ford would be facing incipient challenges at 
the Indianapolis 500 from Toyota. While Toyota is conducting an extensive R&D 
program to determine the feasibility of competing in Indy car racing as an 
engine supplier, no final decision has been reached.

THE PIANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My thanks to Wanda Coleman for "Off the Same Boat" (On the Town, May 8). I 
remember once when a fine grand piano was delivered to my pupil's house.Her 
father, mad as hell, summoned me to his house. "You chose this piano for us! 
What the hell is the matter with it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The piano movers were either forgetful or inexperienced. There is a hidden 
lever that locks a piano's dampers away from contact with the strings during 
transport. No matter what one does, the strings cannot be muted and will 
continue to sound, when struck, until they die away naturally -- quite a long 
time in music. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not release the lever immediately but staged an impromptu music lesson, 
showing how certain notes and chords can be mixed, resulting in marvelous 
colors; how even harsh dissonances can be reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not my first such demonstration -- not by a long shot -- but I remember 
thinking, on my way home, that, counting myself, the girl and her parents, 
there were at least five very different ethnicities represented in that music 
room. I say at least five for I am not sure that I know all of my own 
inheritance.

SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE; LAST WATCH OF THE NIGHT: ESSAYS TOO PERSONAL AND 
OTHERWISE, BY PAUL MONETTE (HARCOURT, BRACE: $21.95; 320 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on who is remembering the event, it was a black lesbian or a Latin 
drag queen who hurled the first bottle that summer night. The particulars of 
the rioting that followed the 1969 police raid on a New York gay bar called 
Stonewall have since lapsed into the convenient shadows of legend. Twenty-five 
years later, the burning barricades that were part of a larger bonfire -- the 
anti-war movement, the Black Panthers, Women's Liberation -- have been paved 
over with the creamy concrete of parade ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid flow of history can easily dislodge moments in time like Stonewall, 
sweeping them up into a tidier narrative of banner waving and chest beating. Or 
simply usurping them to sell beer and dance tickets. In his 12th book, Paul 
Monette probes the core of what lingers behind, beyond the tides of history and 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 essays of "Last Watch of the Night" form the latest installment of his 
autobiographical writings and round out the trilogy that began with "Borrowed 
Time: An AIDS Memoir," then "Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story." Writing 
between August, 1992, and New Year's Eve, 1993, Monette was battling full-blown 
AIDS, "leashed to three separate IV drugs and a small mountain of oral 
medication." Yet the resulting collection is not just a descriptive journal of 
disease and treatment. The broad range of the essays, from a portrait of his 
stalwart dog, Puck, to a meditation on the gravestones of his two lovers, 
attest to more cerebral ambitions. "What I wanted to do instead was look at the 
vectors of my life, the people and places and politics that had stuck with me, 
resonant still despite the deluge of the last twelve years of calamity. How had 
it changed the way I looked at things? Had anything survived intact? And did 
anything mean the same anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no. Widowed twice, Monette writes eloquently about loss. A lapsed 
atheist, Monette writes lucidly about belief. A veteran novelist, Monette 
writes acidly about the homophobic press. While he writes about change 
competently, substantive transformation is another issue. Monette has subtitled 
this collection, "Essays Too Personal and Otherwise," and there's the rub. 
Rather than speak from an experience, Monette tends to speak for it. Much of 
this has to do with the conventional way Monette employs the personal: 
Throughout the collection, "I" too easily lapses into "we," which Monette uses 
to speak as the definitive voice of all lesbians and gay men. Throughout, this 
proves a handicap in addressing the broader contradictions that have sharpened 
in the last two years of political upheaval. These incongruities surfaced most 
clearly during the 1993 march on Washington, which Monette covers in his essay, 
"Mustering." 
</P>
<P>
 After undergoing radiation treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma lesions on his penis 
and his left thigh, Monette crosses the country with a volume of Sappho's 
poetry. Surveying the masses of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans-gendered 
people assembled in the nation's capital that weekend, Monette asks: "Would we 
leave no doubt that we were assembling here for patriotism's sake?" He does so 
without irony, without even a pause to discuss the crimes that are being 
committed around the world in the name of American patriotism. Although Monette 
bemoans the relegation of people with AIDS to the background of that weekend 
("That's not what this march is about," an organizer remarks), he eventually 
gets caught up in the festive swirl, and the deeper problems of the moment get 
swept under the rug: the hypocrisy of a lesbian and gay "civil rights" movement 
clamoring to join the American military even as the Pentagon drops another 
round of Tomahawk cruise missiles on Iraqi heads and rues only that "there were 
no CNN cameras there to record the strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout these essays, Monette's personal tone has trouble keeping up with 
the complexities of the issues he examines. Leafing through Sappho's poetry on 
the flight to Washington, he muses on her legacy as a lesbian poet: "Even if 
all the books are burned, I thought, somehow the emotions survive." Then he 
introduces a lukewarm argument against the idea that sexual identity is a 
social construction. "The post-structural theorists define what 'knowing' is, 
and it doesn't include self-knowledge about sexual orientation." Confused? So 
is Monette. "Doesn't make any sense to me," he writes, and then begs off by 
saying that his own "limited expertise is the history of the heart, and there 
are no breaks in its utterance through all written time." Then he quotes some 
Sappho, as if this will clarify everything. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the emotionality Monette invokes, however, most of the essays in "Last 
Watch" feel strangely tepid. His command of literature is impressive, but 
Monette is more effective when he dusts away the canonical reveries and courts 
the vein-biting stealth of Joan Didion in "Getting Covered." Uncovering his own 
battles with the press, both "alternative" and "mainstream," Monette turns to 
the case of Tony Johnson, 14 years old and living with AIDS when his book, "A 
Rock and A Hard Place," debuted. One reporter launched a cruel campaign to 
discredit Johnson, claiming that he was merely a publisher's invention. While 
not surprised at some of the media's more callous gibes, Monette's indignation 
is righteous and sharp: "The disappearing of Tony Johnson's account of the 
unaccountable world is rather more sinister still. Because it's a way of 
denying AIDS as well as him. And a hundred years hence, when all the tabloid 
victims of 1993 will be dust and ashes, the names no longer ringing the 
teensiest bell, the course of the plague will still attract the bewildered gaze 
of history. And when the Elvis sightings no longer fire the populace, and 
everyone has chewed Howard Hughes's two-foot fingernails to the quick, the 
storm troops of revisionism will trumpet their distortions from the rooftops." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Monette seems more concerned with retelling the grand narratives of 
history than questioning the monstrosity of the original text. "Always, you 
understand, the right wing questions our patriotism, as if the flag were all 
theirs as well as the Bible," he writes in "The Politics of Silence." If there 
is any doubt as to who owns such material, Monette closes the essay by quoting 
the national anthem. Rather than problemize the right wing's Bible thumping and 
flag waving, he simply claims it as his own. "No one in America seemed to want 
to draw the circle that connected the World Trade Center bombing, the killing 
of a doctor at an abortion clinic in Florida, the standoff in Waco," he 
complains in "Mustering." "No one in America was interested in the rise of 
worldwide fundamentalism, the politics of retreat from the modern world." 
Without distinguishing between the real assault on women's reproductive rights 
and the media-imagined Islamophobia that billowed out of the World Trade Center 
that year, the links Monette is trying to make fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 By merely lumping events together into one glorious milkshake of homogeneity, 
the connections seem even more strained. "I didn't think the Lincoln of my 
understanding would have had any trouble equating the Civil Rights struggle of 
people of color with the latter-day dreams of the gay and lesbian movement," 
Monette writes, as the march swarms across the Lincoln Memorial. But the 
disparities in conflating these two struggles are often painfully evident and 
unexamined in Monette's own writing: the African American woman with a "crisp 
white uniform and billowing apron worthy of Tara"; the thieving Asian cabdriver 
who "could have been Aziz in 'A Passage to India,' oversolicitous but not 
without charm." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy enough to excuse such lapses by invoking the license of liberal 
individualism and personal testament. If "Last Watch of the Night" is about 
anything, it is about how a writer who hopes to be immortalized or at least 
remembered by each succeeding generation in a way that he himself defines. But 
Monette's book exposes the limitations of conventional uses of the personal 
essay. His vision of history is seen from a solitary viewpoint that erases the 
diversity of voices that make history. Well-written though they are, what these 
essays fail to acknowledge is that there are more than a million beings in the 
human heart. Ultimately, "I" is just one of them.

SEPARATED BY DIFFERENCES; HOW DO THE LAWS OF THE LAND INSTITUTIONALIZE 
DISCRIMINATION?; CREATED EQUAL: WHY GAY RIGHTS MATTER TO AMERICA, BY MICHAEL 
NAVA AND ROBERT DAWIDOFF (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.95; 144 PP.)  
</P>

<P>
 We live today in a fragmented culture, a place of sectarianism and special 
interests, where the focus tends more to the things that separate us than to 
the things we share. It's an unfortunate development -- although, perhaps, 
inevitable, given the promises this country has made and broken to the 
disenfranchised over the years -- for it comes with an accompanying narrowness 
of vision, a sense that we should just pay attention to our own back yards. Yet 
despite history's failings, the essential strength of American democracy has 
always been its goal of community, its philosophy of empowerment for all. 
Michael Nava and Robert Dawidoff note in "Created Equal: Why Gay Rights Matter 
to America": "Identity politics based on ethnicity, gender, class, or religion 
is the order of the day. But the faith remains . . . that liberty is advanced 
by the wider access of all sorts of people to fundamental civil and human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 "Created Equal" is an attempt to apply the rhetoric of the Civil Rights 
movement to the cause of gay equality, bypassing the issue's more emotional 
aspects in favor of a carefully considered argument for "the principle of equal 
protection under the law." Originally prompted by Governor Wilson's September, 
1991, veto of "a bill that would have prohibited discrimination in employment 
on the basis of sexual orientation," Nava and Dawidoff -- the former a lawyer, 
the latter a professor of history at the Claremont Graduate School -- contend 
that homosexual rights are not a matter of special treatment, but rather a 
classic case of minority empowerment that has relevance to everyone, straight 
or gay, who believes in America's democratic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 This assertion is so clearly true that it hardly seems, at first glance, to 
need restating. It's only common sense that the laws of a free nation should be 
applied equally, no matter what. But common sense has little to do with the 
attitudes of people who "think that (they) neither want nor need to know about 
gays and lesbians," and it is to them that the authors have addressed this 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with a discussion of sodomy statutes -- even now, oral and anal sex 
is illegal in 23 states -- they expose the institutionalized intolerance faced 
by homosexuals in the U.S. "Sodomy laws," they explain, "however lax or 
intermittent their enforcement, are the foundation of discrimination, hindering 
family formation and preventing legalized same-sex marriage. They justify 
second-class citizenship and cannot be looked upon honestly without 
acknowledging that they still stigmatize certain citizens, making them virtual 
outlaws, and encourage and reinforce prejudice against those citizens whether 
or not they break the law." 
</P>
<P>
 With that as a starting point, Nava and Dawidoff discuss the ways in which 
legislation and discrimination interact. Why, they ask, are gay couples denied 
the right of matrimony, and the consequent benefits -- financial, legal and 
emotional -- it allows? How could homosexuality be sufficient cause for a 
Virginia woman to lose custody of her child? 
</P>
<P>
 Central to their argument is the 1986 case of Bowers vs. Hardwick, in which 
the Supreme Court upheld Georgia's sodomy law after it was challenged by a gay 
man arrested in his own home for being in bed with another man. Although the 
court had consistently extended the right of heterosexual privacy in cases such 
as Roe vs. Wade, Justice Byron White concluded in Bowers that "constitutional 
guarantees of liberty do not 'extend a fundamental right to homosexuals to 
engage in acts of consensual sodomy. . . . Proscriptions against that conduct 
have ancient roots.' " But, as Nava and Dawidoff rightly suggest, the idea that 
something should be proscribed because it has always been so is ridiculous, a 
logic of prejudice, not of law. To drive home the point, they quote none other 
than Oliver Wendell Holmes: "It is revolting to have no better reason for a 
rule of law than that it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still 
more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long 
since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the power of its arguments, however, "Created Equal" has its problems, 
principally the authors' propensity for academic language, and their 
distracting habit of reiterating major themes. In addition, their tendency to 
harp on the evils of fundamentalist religion becomes a little tiresome after a 
while. I'm no fan of the religious right, but when it comes to homosexual 
equality, Christian zealots are just the most visible of the opposition forces; 
as Nava and Dawidoff themselves admit, "the revulsion many men and women feel 
at the thought of sexual activity between people of their own sex remains a 
formidable obstacle on the path of gay rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Such qualifications to the contrary, Nava and Dawidoff appear at times 
consumed by the idea that "the opposition to gay rights is the advance guard of 
the religious right's wholesale invasion of the political life of this country. 
. . . Although gays are the present target of the counterrevolution, the rest 
of America is not far behind." It is, in fact, the subject of "Created Equal's" 
longest chapter, a 38-page jeremiad called "God Hates Fags," which, although 
powerful and moving, relates only indirectly to the legal questions at the 
heart of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the indifference, if not the outright hostility, most of the straight 
America has toward homosexuality, I can understand the temptation to tie gay 
rights to some larger specter of oppression that should concern us all. At the 
same time, though, I disagree with the contention that the religious right has 
shaped anti-gay attitudes to suit its own cause. More likely, it is the 
attitudes that have fostered an environment where fundamentalists can plant 
their poison and watch it take root -- a truth even Nava and Dawidoff seem to 
recognize. "We do not expect that if constitutional protections are extended to 
gay and lesbian Americans, the derogatory stereotypes and beliefs about them 
will immediately disappear," they write. "But if they are ever to disappear, 
the state must, at the very least, stop perpetuating them by using them to deny 
gays and lesbians their basic rights." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, if gay rights do matter to America -- and of course they do -- it's 
not because they represent the front line in the battle against the religious 
right. Instead, they matter because the diminishing of any citizen diminishes 
us all, because in a society that calls itself democratic, no one is truly free 
unless everyone is. That is the crux here, the issue that will not go away. And 
the sooner we accept it, the better off we'll be.

COMING OF AGE; TENNESSEE WILLIAMS: EVERYONE ELSE IS AN AUDIENCE, BY RONALD 
HAYMAN (YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $27.50; 268 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Ehrenstein, David Ehrenstein is a free-lance writer and critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like Charles Chaplin and Orson Welles, Tennessee Williams is one of those 
supremely troublesome artists the cultural watchdogs of this country have never 
quite forgiven themselves for letting in the front gates. Wildly hailed for 
their early works, the silent clown and the sound-era writer-director went on 
to be damned by both the popular press and the academy for subsequent efforts 
deemed either "too serious" (Chaplin) or "not serious enough" (Welles). With 
Williams, however, the thumbs-down signal came in a much more cryptic fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of his twin Broadway triumphs, "The Glass Menagerie" and "A 
Streetcar Named Desire," Time magazine declared Williams guilty of creating 
works that were "basically negative" and "sterile." Why were these seminal 
contributions to the American theater, whose vivid language, complex characters 
and rich emotional texture had captured the world's attention suddenly being 
dismissed so offhandedly? Because Time knew that Tennessee Williams was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1940s, homosexuality was deemed unfit for open discussion in a 
"family" publication like Henry Luce's, so the (aforementioned) code language 
was used to get the point across instead. But by the 1960s (then) New York 
Times drama critic Stanley Kaufman had mustered up the effort to be somewhat 
less cryptic when he revealed in a Sunday column that "three of the most 
successful playwrights of the last 20 years are (reputed) homosexuals" whose 
works offered "a badly distorted picture of American women, marriage, and 
society in general." There was no doubt that Tennessee Williams and Edward 
Albee were two of the names on Kaufman's hit list, but the identity of the 
third man was somewhat obscure: You could count on being the toast of every 
cocktail party in town back then if you knew it was William Inge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily it would be the height of absurdity to launch a polemical attack 
against a foe who can't be identified by name. Kaufman, however, wriggled off 
this hook by declaring that "in society the homosexual's life must be 
discreetly concealed": "Society" supplied the excuse for not naming names. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this social pressure, the critic insisted, that forced gay playwrights 
to create "two-sex versions of the one sex experiences" they "really" knew -- 
thus leading to "distortions" of heterosexuality. Claiming he wasn't making a 
case of sexual apartheid, Kaufman declared this sad situation was "our" fault 
(all New York Times readers apparently being heterosexual) and that homosexual 
playwrights should be "allowed" to write freely. But the truth of the matter 
was Tennessee Williams had never made any effort to "discreetly conceal" his 
sexuality: he had been writing freely about such matters long before Kaufman 
gave him permission to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary subject of Williams' writings (both dramatic and fictional) was 
the social outcast -- people whose lives were so marginal their presence barely 
registered. Going beyond the limits of realism, Williams discovered in the 
voices of these outcasts a means of creating a new sort of theatrical poetry. 
Far more inspired by women than men in his writings, Williams dealt with 
homosexuality for the most part in passing. Still, short stories like "One Arm" 
and "Desire and the Black Masseur" and such one-act plays as "Auto-Da-Fe," 
"Something Unspoken" and "Suddenly Last Summer" find him illuminating different 
aspects of gay life. Significantly one of Williams most important full-length 
works, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," deals explicitly with an All-American football 
hero who would rather share his bed with another All-American football hero 
than his far from unattractive wife. 
</P>
<P>
 You will look long and hard to find any mention of this simple fact in any of 
the initial reviews of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," which invariably insisted that 
its hero's motives for spurning his wife were "vague" and "mysterious." But 
then what could you expect from a critical context that refused to recognize 
that Albee's "The Zoo Story" was about a homosexual pick-up, insisted on seeing 
the thoroughly heterosexual "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" as a transvestite 
tragicomedy, and praised Inge as the poet laureate of middle-class 
heterosexuality with his "Come Back Little Sheba" and "Bus Stop," only to 
scream "degenerate" when he turned to homosexual themes in "Natural Affection" 
and "Where's Daddy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course that was back in the (allegedly) freewheeling 1960s. Today with Tony 
Kushner's self-proclaimed "gay fantasia" "Angels in America" winning the 
Pulitzer prize, the atmosphere would seem to be ripe for a proper reassessment 
of Williams' work. His plays, in near-constant revival, are more popular than 
ever. Moreover, a whole generation of new writers -- Kushner in particular -- 
bears witness to his incalculable influence on the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is something of a shock to come across a book like Ronald Hayman's 
"Tennessee Williams: Everyone Else is an Audience." Claiming to be a study of 
the relationship between Williams' life and art, this 268-page volume is little 
more than a rehash of every canard that has been volleyed at the playwright 
since Time fired the first shot across its bow. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 20 years of drug and alcohol addiction, coupled with devastating 
openness about his promiscuous homosexuality, had all but destroyed one of 
America's greatest playwrights," screams the dust jacket. Paying only the 
mildest lip service to Williams' talent, Hayman strikes sob-sister-like poses 
of disingenuous concern for the substance abuse, hypochondria, and emotional 
problems that plagued the playwright's later years. Raising a sternly 
disapproving eyebrow at Williams sexual life, Hayman makes not the slightest 
effort to comprehend it, going so far as to state "in his dealings with men 
(Williams) often enjoyed talking as if he -- and they -- were women," utilizing 
such terms as "My Dear Daughter" and "My Sainted Mother." 
</P>
<P>
 In a year that has seen such insightful studies of gay artists as Edmund 
White's "Genet" and Brad Gooch's Frank O'Hara biography, "City Poet," there's 
no excuse for Hayman's inability to navigate the simplest forms of camp slang. 
But you can't expect much from a writer who toes the '60s-era line on the 
alleged transvestite substitutions of gay playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
 That Williams was able to identify with both sexes is not merely a measure of 
his talent, but a key to why the plays continue to fascinate audiences 
regardless of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to have a doctorate in English to recognize the fact that 
Williams used persons and incidents in his own life as models. But it takes 
more than a little insight to explain how Williams transformed raw reality into 
the stuff of fiction. Hayman doesn't even try.

 One can only wonder at this biographer's motives when in another passage he 
quotes Gore Vidal's approving words about Williams' dedicated writing habits 
only to turn around and remark that: (Williams) spent so many strenuous hours 
at his typewriter that he gave the impression of being self-disciplined, but 
the need to write was so urgent that it was more like self-indulgence." These 
are dangerous words coming from Hayman who, in an exceedingly short space of 
time, has put biographies of Sade, Nietzsche, Kafka, Brecht, Sartre and Proust 
under his belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' life may have been a mess -- particularly toward its end -- but the 
same can't be said of his art. "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Summer and Smoke," 
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Sweet Bird of Youth" are in near-constant revival 
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago Vanessa Redgrave brought "Orpheus Descending," one of 
Williams' most eccentric plays, to unexpectedly vivid life. And, if reviews are 
to be believed, a Chicago theatrical company has revealed "The Night of the 
Iguana," a work frequently cited as proof of Williams' late period decline, to 
be thoroughly first-rate. Maybe there's hope for such problematic works as 
"Camino Real," "Out Cry" and "The Red Devil Battery Sign" provided the right 
actors and directors can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also an opening for a new Williams biographer.

 The Learning Tree (Bravo Sunday at 5 p.m., Monday at 10:30 a.m., Friday at 6 
p.m.) is photographer-turned-filmmaker Gordon Parks's autobiographical 1969 
film about growing up black in a Kansas farming community in the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 The King of Marvin Gardens (Cinemax Wednesday at 4:10 a.m.), Bob Rafelson's 
memorable 1972 mood piece, set in a seedy Atlantic City, stars Jack Nicholson 
and Bruce Dern as brothers, one striving to prevent the other from destroying 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Icicle Thief (Bravo Thursday at 6 p.m., Friday at midnight): Outraged at 
how TV chopped up his films, Italian filmmaker Maurizio Nichetti got inspired 
revenge in this delicious 1990 comedy-satire in which a mysterious power outage 
scrambles the world of films with that of TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanda (Bravo Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 10 a.m.) is an extraordinary 1971 
work in which Barbara Loden stars in her own film as the woebegone girlfriend 
of a two-bit crook (Michael Higgins); what emerges is a fully realized portrait 
of a pair of losers, drawn in gritty realistic style and filled out with humor 
and despair.

 I don't think too many people are aware that CBS has canceled "Evening 
Shade."I hope that all its fans will write CBS and protest the cancellation 
loud and long. If CBS doesn't bring it back, hopefully ABC or NBC will acquire 
it. It was one of the few quality shows left on TV.

 "A Century of Women" (TBS) was extremely well made. The story of the women it 
portrayed is awe-inspiring, and caused me to marvel at the progress women have 
made in the past 100 years.Thanks to feature articles like yours (TV Times, 
June 5), my gender will be able to continue to make strides for our daughters 
-- and sons. Many thanks to all who made both the documentary and the cover 
article possible.

 Once you brush past the dreary domestic scenes that set up the plot's flash 
point, the 1993 TV movie A Family of Strangers (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) turns 
into an absorbing adoption mystery. Melissa Gilbert stars as a young woman who 
needs to trace her family history in order to have life-saving brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadly Intentions ... Again? (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a routinely made yet odd 
1991 TV movie, stars Harry Hamlin as a man fresh out of prison for having 
plotted the murder of his wife. Hamlin's character objects to a book and the 
miniseries about him and starts having murderous thoughts all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Scott's 1990 Revenge (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is about how a Navy pilot 
(Kevin Costner) falls desperately in love with the wife (Madeleine Stowe) of a 
Mexican millionaire overlord (Anthony Quinn); what might have been a 
galvanizing pulp thriller bogs down in melodramatic murk. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken from a real-life Vietnam War incident, Brian De Palma's superb 1989 
Casualties of War (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) turns into a battle epic with a 
screw loose, conveying a sense of moral quagmire, all hell exploding around it. 
Michael J. Fox, never better, is the Minnesota farm boy who resists a gang rape 
planned by a macho sergeant (Sean Penn, who bursts the bounds of his role with 
a gargoyle intensity). 
</P>
<P>
 Bullitt (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.), a taut 1968 action film, stars Steve 
McQueen as a San Francisco police detective assigned to guard a criminal 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET presents on Saturday night two of director George Sidney's best musicals: 
the evergreen Kiss Me Kate (at 9 p.m.), featuring Cole Porter tunes and Howard 
Keel and Kathryn Grayson as a battling but loving couple whose stormy personal 
lives parallel their roles in a musical version of "The Taming of the Shrew"; 
and Anchors Aweigh (KCET Saturday at 10:50 p.m.), a lively tale of two sailors 
(Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra), highlighted by Kelly's famous dance with the 
cartoons Tom and Jerry.

A YEAR IN THE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your May 22 Crypto-Quote, you noted in the biography accompanying the 
illustration that W. C. Fields was born in 1879. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted this is a mosquito-size error, but it's an irksome one in that this is 
an ongoing mistake.From the time I was 14 1/2, I would drive my father, Gene 
Fowler, to the residences of his famous friends such as W. C. Fields, John 
Barrymore and Jack Dempsey. Fields told me he was born in 1880, the year that 
is also listed on the gold plaque in front of the reliquary holding his ashes 
at Forest Lawn Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 An atheist, Fields stated in his will that he wanted to be "immediately 
cremated" and that there be no funeral services. However, he ended up having 
three, all in one day at Forest Lawn Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was a non-religious affair where actor-ventriloquist Edgar Bergen 
recited a warm eulogy. The second was a Catholic Mass for members of Fields' 
family. And the third was a sort of cultish thing in front of the crypt where 
his mistress, Carlotta Monti, held forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Being Catholic, the Fields family would not allow his body to be cremated. It 
took two years before Superior Court Judge William R. McKay handed down the 
edict that, according to the wishes put forth by Fields in his will, the corpse 
was to be cremated. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A common mistake indeed. Numerous publications, including the World Almanac 
and "Halliwell's Filmgoer's Companion," list the year of Fields' birth as 1879.

THE JAWBONE'S CONNECTED TO. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David B. Reiss (Letters, May 22) is wrong in saying that the word for 
Kissinger-type experts, "jaboney," is the diminutive of "jawboner." Jaboney 
actually stems from giabone, Italian-American slang translated roughly as 
"self-important fool."It derives from the northwestern-Italian Piemontese 
dialect word giambone (same meaning, pronounced jahm-boh-nay), which comes from 
the dialect word for ham, giambon. And giambon probably comes, as many 
Piemontese words do, from the French, in this case from the French for ham, 
jambon. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I first heard the word "jaboney" in 1953. Could it stem from the Italian word 
gibonne, meaning gibbon, a small arboreal ape? 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to guess the derivation of a word can make a monkey out of anyone.

COVER STORY: SHOOTING FOR A PLACE OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID, Beth Kleid is a frequent contributor to TV Times and Calendar. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A T-shirt worn on the set of "Models Inc.," the "Melrose Place" spinoff from 
Aaron Spelling, sums it up: "Beautiful People. Big Problems." 
</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, one of the beautiful people in the stylish Models Inc. offices 
on a San Fernando Valley sound stage is model Julie Dante, the petite blonde in 
the skintight white lace dress played by actress Kylie Travis. Julie's problem 
of the day -- other than being the show's "bitch of record," as Spelling puts 
it -- is that her agency's no-nonsense boss Hillary Michaels (Linda Gray) seems 
to be passing her over for a fresh new face. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want that hayseed you can have her," Julie hisses to Hillary in her 
Australian accent. 
</P>
<P>
 But actress Travis has a big problem herself during the scene. "These shoes 
are so painful," she winces, pointing to the high-heeled strappy numbers she's 
wearing. The life of a model does have its occupational hazards. After a quick 
change into suede mules, she can deliver her deliciously cutting lines more 
comfortably: "I'm going to get to the top and stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 Harboring similar dreams for their show are executive producers Charles Pratt 
Jr. and Frank South, who created "Models Inc." under Spelling's watchful eye. 
So they're going all out with the program about the very complicated lives of a 
group of models at a top agency. "We're pushing it to the max," Pratt explains. 
"If we say, 'This is like way over the top,' then we know it's good." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you don't know if the show's going to make it or not, you want every 
base covered," he says. Therefore, the show offers a cast of stunning women 
with great bods adorned in couture on the runway and hip duds when they're just 
hanging out. They all live together in a gorgeous Malibu beach house (owned by 
Hillary, their surrogate mother- from-hell), which makes for some serious cat 
fights over the orange juice in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 To that, add a good dose of bed-hopping with the show's studly dudes, and 
enough juicy plots to keep viewers screaming at their TV sets. "I think they'll 
be so mad they'll want to spit," jokes Pratt, who with South also writes 
"Melrose." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike "Melrose," which took a whole season to find its soapy niche, "Models" 
isn't wasting any time. "It's more of a roller coaster ride," Pratt says. "The 
pacing of the show is faster. The lives of the people are a little more twisted 
and involved." 
</P>
<P>
 That could be enough to get "Melrose" addicts salivating. The show was one of 
the highest-rated dramas among 18- to 34-year-olds this past season. This 
summer, "Models" will air in the "Melrose" time slot. The new show already has 
Spelling hooked: "I honestly must tell you that when I saw the first cut, I 
really got cold chills." Does that happen to the esteemed producer often? "No, 
or I would be frozen to death by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved say although it's set amid the high-gloss world of modeling, 
the main draw is that the show is really just about people.  
</P>
<P>
 People like Julie, the show's bad girl with the sharp tongue. "She's not so 
much bad as she is complex," corrects Travis from behind her Ray Bans while 
smoking a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Travis anything like her character? "I think there's a little Julie in 
everybody," says the former Ford model who prefers acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, meet Julie's polar opposite -- Sarah Owens, the sweet farm girl from 
Iowa introduced on "Melrose." Actress Cassidy Rae, 18, who was brought up on a 
farm herself, describes her naive character: "She's starting to realize that 
not everybody is so nice and wonderful." That could be considered an 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Carrie, the model who's over the hill -- at age 29. "I can relate 
to her feelings about getting older in the fashion business because I know that 
pressure is there," says ex-model Carrie-Anne Moss, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the industry's pressures, Rae says she doesn't have to 
succumb to them to play a model. She isn't worried about being rail-thin. "I 
haven't had any time to work out. I feel like I'm never going to really look 
totally authentic as a model -- I can just do my best." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, the show already has a waif model. As well as a supermodel. 
</P>
<P>
 Now meet David Michaels, played by Brian Gaskill, who is Models Inc.'s VP and 
as Hillary's offspring, heir apparent. Get ready for some nasty mother-son 
spats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have conflict," says Gaskill, 24, in his trailer, his black 
sweatshirt half-unzipped to show bare chest. "I probably get along with the 
models too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the show's eight young actors are virtual unknowns, Spelling sees 
great potential: "I don't think many people in this country knew people like 
Luke Perry or Jennie Garth . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So former "Dallas" star Linda Gray is not only den mother to the models, she's 
like a mom to the actors who come to her for advice. "I have children their 
age," she points out. From the size of her trailer, it's clear she's the show's 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray loves playing queen bee Hillary, first seen on "Melrose." "She's the 
woman of the '90s. She owns her own business. On 'Dallas,' I was the victim. 
Now it's, 'Don't mess with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the show is cutting edge, why, when the world of modeling 
celebrates ethnic diversity, are the show's main characters so racially 
homogenous? "We've got a lot of characters coming in," explains Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that, he isn't revealing anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Models Inc." airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. on Fox; it will air in its regular 9 
p.m. time slot beginning July 6.

ESCAPE, BY DAYTON LUMMIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be those great distances, 
</P>
<P>
 the silence, wind sweeping 
</P>
<P>
 across nowhere into nothing --  
</P>
<P>
 the sensation of freedom, 
</P>
<P>
 immature, perhaps, 
</P>
<P>
 escape . . .  
</P>
<P>
 most people are not 
</P>
<P>
 into all that, not really . . .  
</P>
<P>
 only drifters know, 
</P>
<P>
 and probably they don't 
</P>
<P>
 really understand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a country of the mind 
</P>
<P>
 not wandered into easily, 
</P>
<P>
 missed by thinking 
</P>
<P>
 about it too much; 
</P>
<P>
 the looking at maps 
</P>
<P>
 when rain is drifting down 
</P>
<P>
 on quiet nights 
</P>
<P>
 in overcrowded lands, 
</P>
<P>
 too many people around, 
</P>
<P>
 the heaping up, 
</P>
<P>
 pressing in. 
</P>
<P>
 But that vast space, 
</P>
<P>
 it was nothing, 
</P>
<P>
 a great emptiness --  
</P>
<P>
 relax, 
</P>
<P>
 knowing it is there, 
</P>
<P>
 having wandered in it. 
</P>

 AND NO BIRDS SING: The Story of an Ecological Disaster in a Tropical Paradise 
by Mark Jaffe (Simon & Schuster: $23; 282 pp.). In 1984, when a young biologist 
presented a paper theorizing that Guam's birds were being wiped out by an 
imported snake, many other scientists found her conclusions hard to swallow. "I 
just sat there thinking this is all bull," a tropical bird expert told 
Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Mark Jaffe. "I've been on Guam several times and 
I've never even seen a brown tree snake." Well, so much for the experts: Julie 
Savidge, the biologist in question, was not only correct, but further shook up 
biology's conventional wisdom by demonstrating that snakes can thrive on 
processed food (her captive tree snakes loved balled-up hamburger meat) and by 
supplementing her field work with seemingly unrelated evidence (Savidge found 
statistics on snake-induced electrical outages that confirmed not only the 
reptile's rapid growth in range and population but also its remarkable, if 
sometimes counterproductive, agility). The brown tree snake, a thin but fierce 
native of the South Pacific -- it's been known to take chicken off barbecue 
grills and attempt to eat sleeping children -- in many places found no natural 
enemies or competitors, and on Guam pushed some native birds, mainly through 
egg predation, into extinction. Jaffe chronicles both Savidge's attempt, with 
numerous colleagues, to make her case against the snake, and by other 
conservationists to save the Micronesian kingfisher and the Guam rail through 
last-ditch captive breeding programs.He can't provide a happy ending, however; 
the snake has been found on Hawaii in recent years, probably brought there 
aboard military transport planes. "And No Birds Sing" is not an eloquent book 
-- the style is daily newspaper-ese -- but Jaffe has stumbled on an absorbing 
story, one that highlights the dangers inherent in man's tampering with the 
natural world.

 LONG ROAD TO FREEDOM: The Advocate History of the Gay and Lesbian Movement 
edited by Mark Thompson, foreword by Randy Shilts. (St. Martin's: $40; 420 pp.) 
Here is a history of the modern gay and lesbian movement, with essays, 
photographs, cartoons and interviews from the Advocate, that siren of gay life 
since 1967. There's a lot of humor and a lot of chagrin, but best of all, it 
feels like a family photo album.

ON THE TOWN: HARD BARGAINS; LET THE BUYER BE WHERE THE GOODS ARE, ESPECIALLY 
WHEN SHOPPING IN A WAREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wanda Coleman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noontime parking is fairly accessible, but we can tell by the number of 
vehicles in the multileveled lot that the hordes are way ahead of us. Dozens 
more are queuing up behind. There's a predominance of RVs, vans and station 
wagons. Clusters of parents and children shuttle to and from this mecca of 
families. Our destination: one of a corporate chain of retail warehouses where, 
in theory, the shopper is beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 I have the dining table, but I've spent months looking for a matched set of 
chairs, occasionally stopping to quick-browse thrift and antique shops from 
Sherman Oaks to San Diego. But even the most marginally functional assemblages 
of splinters command woefully spectacular prices. I've decided I might as well 
splurge on new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's interior is designed in blond wood, stainless steel and concrete 
painted a semigloss off-white. Glazed-eyed patrons tote large primary-colored 
baskets or push enormous shopping carts that accommodate heavy items. We notice 
the easy-to-read signs in simple English with arrows pointing the way. I thrill 
to the smell of bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabbing a cart, we fall in step and begin ooohing and awwwing, following the 
primary-colored line on the floor that will, according to our sign, lead us to 
the wonderful world of dining rooms, where countless specimens of chair await 
our inspection. In and around we merrily wind, stopping when something catches 
our eyes -- the glint of brass, the shimmer of crystal, the muted gloss of 
finished wicker. Normally we hate shopping, yet we begin to dreamily refurnish 
our modest digs -- this and that to go there and there. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at our destination, we're delighted to find beaucoups chairs of 
metal, plastic and expensive woods suited to every function and taste, 
down-home to opulent. We've noticed several strategically placed stations 
manned by smiling, tag-wearing clerks. We motion one young man aside, and he 
respectfully tells us that we will find membership forms at each station, that 
all we need do is fill one out, select our purchases -- noting each serial and 
lot number -- then follow the arrows to the storage areas with matching numbers 
where we'll find the very items we've selected. All we need do is place those 
items on the cart, make our way to checkout, present our membership form and 
voila ! 
</P>
<P>
 Serious fun begins as I relax and browse. Huz, antsy at first, gradually 
grooves to my mood as I compare patterns, styles and quality. Once I make my 
difficult first, second and third choices, carefully noting serial and lot 
numbers, we're surprised to discover that more than an hour has zipped by. 
Smilingly, we cart off through display after display till we find ourselves in 
the designated storage area. 
</P>
<P>
 Yipes! It's a drab rat's nightmare, a dim-lit mile-high maze of endless aisles 
of unfathomable stuff. We break into flight-or-fight sweats. Huz is ready to 
chuck it and split. I want those chairs! Doggedly, we push forward, our cart 
intermittently colliding with the rudely competitive carts of other shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quicker than you can recite the Bill of Rights, we're lost! But how can that 
be? We were careful to note the correct lot number. I anchor myself and the 
cart to a cul-de-sac while my better half hurries for help. When he finally 
returns, his shirt is soaked, his hair is disarranged, his face is flush with 
rage. "These idiots use a double-digit system!" Identical series of numbers in 
massive clusters are demarcated only by different primary-colored lines. We're 
at the wrong end. We now have to start over at the beginning.  
</P>
<P>
 We bristle, turn around and jostle our way backward through the maze. We 
quickly realize that the Mall God has provided no exit except checkout. The 
lines are 20-deep. Exasperated, we ditch the cart and begin again only to 
discover the store's population has doubled. Defying jangled nerves, we 
scramble through the sea of bodies, savoring a small victory as we finally 
stand before the proper lot. "Uh-oh! Oh, no!" we chorus as we discover none of 
our choices are available. Crushed, I admit defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Making our late-afternoon escape, we marvel at the happy faces carrying giant 
boxes to and fro, people who actually enjoy shopping according to crowd 
control. We're desperate to relieve ourselves of the icky anxiety sticking our 
craws. I recommend a nearby watering hole where the drinks run deep and the 
munchies are savory. He gets us there as fast as our wheels will drive us.

 COMPLEXIFICATION: Explaining a Paradoxical World Through the Science of 
Surprise by John L. Casti (HarperCollins; $24; 320 pp.). For two centuries, 
cyberneticist W. Ross Ashby observed in 1956, science "has been exploring 
systems that are either intrinsically simple or that are capable of being 
analyzed into simple components."Science, in other words, had tended to limit 
itself to investigating phenomena to which the scientific method lent itself . 
. . meaning that many of the complexities of the world were simply overlooked, 
if not mangled on a Procrustean bed. Ashby's remark lies at the heart of 
"Complexification," for John Casti, a fellow of the Santa Fe Institute in New 
Mexico, here lays out some of the groundwork for the study of deeply complex 
systems, systems that defy all efforts to reduce them to their component parts. 
Like Douglas Hofstadter's "Goedel, Escher, Bach," James Gleick's "Chaos," and 
Casti's own "Searching for Certainty," "Complexification" can be very difficult 
to understand, but this is one case where confusion should not be laid at the 
author's feet; Casti is a lucid writer, and compelling even when the reader -- 
this reader, at least -- comprehends only the basic thrust of an argument. In 
discussing such things as strange attractors, algorithm programs, Mandelbrot 
sets and catastrophe theory, Casti goes a long way toward demonstrating, as he 
notes in the book's final pages, "the limits of reductionism as a universal 
problem-solving approach."

 THE REINVENTION OF WORK: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time by Matthew 
Fox (HarperSanFrancisco: $22; 342 pp.). Dr. Larry Dossey talks of "joyless 
striving"; former business executive Rolf Osterberg calls it "one of the drugs 
we use to deaden and block the emotional aspect within us"; oral historian 
Studs Terkel refers to "a Monday through Friday sort of dying."What these three 
writers are talking about, of course, is modern work -- the job dissatisfaction 
that afflicts, according to one account cited in this volume, as many as nine 
workers in 10. That may be an exaggeration, but there's no question that 
millions of people today find work much less rewarding than it should be, in 
large measure because work is now defined almost exclusively in terms of 
economic rather than intrinsic worth. Matthew Fox, a self-described 
"post-denominational priest" expelled by the Dominican order last year for his 
radical, New Age-ish views, explores the causes of and cures for this malaise 
in "The Reinvention of Work," and seems to touch all the relevant bases. The 
book has problems, though, for Fox, who now heads an Oakland-based institute 
devoted to Creation Spirituality, employs an inspirational style that's more 
enthusiastic than plausible. Moreover, although Fox's views seem somewhat less 
intellectually sound than Joseph Campbell's, he's au courant to a fault; he 
loves to use terms such as praxis and paradigm shift. To his credit, though, 
Fox knows good material when he sees it, and that's the major strength of this 
book -- the ideas about work with which it is littered, culled from Meister 
Eckhart and Thomas Aquinas, E. F. Schumacher and Rainer Marie Rilke.

 STRIPPING and Other Stories by Pagan Kennedy (Serpent's Tail/High Risk Books: 
$10.99 paper; 169 pp.). String together the names of the author, book and 
publisher -- Pagan, "Stripping," and Serpent's Tail, respectively -- and you're 
likely to think of latter-day witches and furtive, canbalistic rituals. Don't 
be put off, though; "Stripping" is literary fiction of high quality, the sort 
of story collection that the big, commercial houses should publish but 
frequently avoid. Credit Serpent's Tail, consequently, for believing that Pagan 
Kennedy deserves a mainstream audience beyond the Boston area, where she 
produces a magazine and a cable television show. Both the 'zine and the show 
carry the name "Pagan" in their titles, which implies a self-conscious, 
rebellious narcissism, but most of the stories in this collection are in fact 
middle-class traditional, taking place in summer camps, Elvis' Graceland, 
college buildings and ordinary suburban homes. In "Camp," shy girl meets shy 
boy, and the narrator -- wearing make-up for the first time, and a new haircut 
-- finds herself thinking "For all he knew, back home I might be popular"; in 
"The Black Forest" a college student discovers Nietzsche, and her earlier life 
now seems "like Ohio: flat, but with a fast, sparkling river of doubt running 
through it"; in "The Tunnel," a girl recalls lying for the first time, and 
remembers going "on and on and it was like singing, like the hymns we sang in 
church that went straight up to God." These stories are typical of "Stripping" 
in that they show smart young women attempting to make sense of a perplexing 
world, one not so much hostile as unpredictable and indifferent.Take "Shrinks," 
for example; in this tale Sara says she's decided to take Prozac, just like her 
mother, because Sara half-believes the drug "will keep me distracted, which is 
better than being neurotic."

 THE TALE MAKER by Mark Harris (Donald J. Fine; $21; 215 pp.). Rimrose, the 
occasionally admirable writer who stars in "The Tale Maker," has one major goal 
in life; "to keep every story at home until it was absolute done."And much of 
the time he succeeds, for a good portion of Mark Harris' 13th novel takes place 
in the late '50s or early '60s, when short stories were published in numerous 
major magazines. Times get tougher, however, and Rimrose's more-or-less idyllic 
life comes a cropper: the stories don't come, the phone doesn't ring and 
Rimrose finds himself essentially broke. Rimrose is desperate enough to 
consider taking a salaried job -- at his father's newspaper, at his alma 
mater's mysteriously powerful information agency, at another, distant 
university -- when one Kakapick, a ne'er-do-well acquaintance from Rimrose's 
college years, suddenly becomes a respected, powerful academic. He offers 
Rimrose a high-paid, tenured position, and it is the perfect job -- except for 
the fact that Kakapick remains a manipulative, misanthropic philistine, having 
come into his own only because he has devised, implausibly, a statistical, 
supposedly objective scale for ranking fiction writers. Harris, best known for 
"Bang the Drum Slowly," has written a light comic novel on the never-ending war 
between trusting writers and cynical critics, and sometimes it works, as when 
Rimrose's mother pronounces that her son is "going to be one of the great 
writers that never drank." Much of the time, though, "The Tale Maker" falls 
flat, for Harris doesn't go in for the wicked, Waugh-like satire that his 
plotting seems to require. Cretins like Kakapick are indeed capable of 
ascending to positions of responsibility through naked ambition and sheer luck, 
but neither Rimrose's last-minute resistance to his would-be mentor, nor 
Kakapick's eventual comeuppance, is particularly satisfying.

 HALF A LOOK OF CAIN: A Fantastical Narrative by William Goyen (TriQuarterly 
Books/Northwestern University Press; $22.50; 121 pp.). William Goyen became 
famous in literary circles in 1950 with the publication of "The House of 
Breath," his first novel.He never attained commercial success, however; by the 
time of his death in 1983, he was virtually forgotten. Reginald Gibbons, editor 
of the literary periodical TriQuarterly, hopes to change that by bringing 
Goyen's work back into print, a project begun with this previously unpublished 
novel. "Half a Look of Cain" was rejected by editors in the 1950s for its 
enigmatic narrative style and veiled references to homosexuality, but by modern 
standards the book, on both counts, is tame; the stories told here fit together 
rather like matroushka dolls, and Goyen's subject is not the sexual act itself 
but the emotional and physical longing which precedes it. "Half a Look of 
Cain," as a result, often feels dated, like a museum curio; the narrators -- 
primarily a male nurse, his patient and a lighthouse keeper -- express their 
interest in homosexual love -- made most explicit through the story of a circus 
aerialist -- only indirectly, causing the novel, however daring for its time, 
to seem coy today. The novel's central philosophy -- the yin-and-yang of love 
and destruction, of Cain and Abel -- isn't exactly new, either, yet it remains 
interesting because Goyen's prose is admirable. It's hard not to be moved when 
the nurse, at the end of the book, calls the 1950s "that time of the crippled 
mind, that time of the world when human beings, not being able to tell the 
truth about themselves, could not tell it about other people and so maimed 
themselves and everything they touched: that time of the crutch-war of the 
cripples."

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; A '90S SPIN ON 'HUCK FINN' COMES TO 
THE DISNEY CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A mischievous boy, a runaway slave and a raging river: Mark Twain's classic 
1885 tale of unlikely friendship, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," has 
spoken to several generations. And it has gone through numerous screen 
versions. In 1931, Huck was played by child star Jackie Coogan, who eventually 
became TV's Uncle Fester in "The Addams Family." Mickey Rooney and Ron Howard 
also had their turns as Huck, in 1939 and 1975, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent film incarnation, 1993's The Adventures of Huck Finn, which 
attempts to add a 1990s feel, airs Sunday on the Disney Channel. It stars 
Elijah Wood (also in this summer's "North") in the title role and co-stars Tony 
nominee Courtney B. Vance as Jim. British comedian Robbie Coltrane plays the 
Duke and Jason Robards is featured as the King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a new generation who hasn't seen it with these contemporary 
attitudes," says executive producer Steve White. "It's classic and enduring 
material, which, when redone, can have something new brought to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The river and the countryside figure as characters in this film as much as any 
of the human stars, White says, and in a way that wasn't technically possible 
in previous versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to look at it in a fresh way," Vance says. "It has 1993 
sensibilities now. We didn't highlight the use of the word nigger, for example. 
It was a fact of life back then, but the story itself still stands as an 
emotional connection." 
</P>
<P>
 That emotional connection is key to the book's enduring power, Vance believes. 
"It's a coming-of-age story of a young white boy who is basically taught his 
emotional lessons through the help of a black man, who at that time, couldn't 
do so many things." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's remarkable about it," White adds, "is the relationship between what 
they used to call a 'Negro' slave and this white boy. The story is about what 
it means to be a man and a father in the deepest sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim's an apt role model, adds Vance. "He's very dignified, very 
family-oriented and trying to make the best of what he could in the situation 
he's in. Anyone can learn from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Issues of right and wrong are at the forefront of the story, the actor points 
out. "Jim challenges Huck. He helps him realize that just because something has 
been a certain way for years and years, like slavery, it doesn't mean it's 
right. There's also a strong learning point in the story that there are things 
that are right and wrong, like slavery. Like racism." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Adventures of Huck Finn" premieres on "The Magical World of Disney" 
Sunday at 7 p.m. on the Disney Channel. For ages 6 and up. Some scenes in the 
early part of the film, of brutality between Huck and his father, may be 
disturbing to young children. More Family Shows

<P>
 Featuring appearances by film and television celebrities, Universal Studios 
Summer Blast (Sunday 3-4 p.m. and Tuesday 3-4 p.m. TBS; Wednesday 6 p.m. USA; 
Monday 6 p.m. Family) travels between Universal studios in Hollywood and 
Florida with host Lisa Hartman Black. Interwoven will be highlights of the 
tours' newest attractions. Musical performers Jon Secada, Celine Dion, Richard 
Marx, All-4-One and comedian George Wallace make appearances. For ages 8 and 
up.

 MY GORGEOUS LIFE: The Life, the Loves, the Legend by Dame Edna Everage (Dell: 
$11.95; 284 pp.). The toast of what remains of the British Empire, Dame Edna 
Everage (the alter-ego of Barry Humphries) has gone beyond mere stardom to 
become a veritable nova.Although she assures the reader that "Gorgeous" is not 
"just another showbiz autobiography written by a ghost for some stupid 
empty-headed glamourpuss," her memoir ranks as the most outrageous send-up of 
Hollywood books since Patrick Dennis' "Little Me." As she chronicles her rise 
to megastardom, Dame Edna mercilessly lampoons the cliches of the genre, 
littering the text with dropped names and barbed observations. Although she 
could have inspired Rogers and Hammerstein to pen "There Is Nothing Like a 
Dame," Everage accepts adoration with becoming modesty, noting, "I would 
probably be the reincarnation of Mother Theresa except that she's still alive."

PALM LATITUDES: STATE OF MIND; GIVING PEACE A CHANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 V eni, Sancte, Spiritus. " 
</P>
<P>
 It's a diverse group singing this chant: Catholics, Presbyterians, 
Episcopalians, Eastern Orthodox, as well as a Hindu, a Buddhist from Canada and 
an Orthodox Jew who survived the Holocaust. All have come to a daylong 
conference in Montecito to learn about Taize, an ecumenical movement with its 
roots in Nazi-occupied France. 
</P>
<P>
 Taize has drawn hundreds of Southern Californians into its fold and at least 
six regional churches, including All Saints Episcopal in Beverly Hills, 
occasionally offer Taize services. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the French village of Taize during WWII by a Swiss emigre, Taize is 
a unique community. This irenic form of Christian worship welcomes members of 
any and all faiths, but is affiliated with no organized denomination. Its 
founder and leader, known as Brother Roger, refuses to let it grow into a 
formal movement and rejects donations. Its aim is simple: world peace and an 
end to religious differences through prayer, silent meditation and chants. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conference at La Casa de Maria, a Montecito retreat, all 200 attendees 
recite a Taize chant: "When the night becomes dark, your love, oh Lord, is a 
fire." They continue for many minutes; then, almost mystically, the chanting 
ends at precisely the same moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're sensing today is what Taize hopes for in its worship: a movement 
toward prayer breaking down barriers, toward the all-embracing love of God," 
says Ann Jaqua, the conference leader. "We are told by the mystics that dark 
and light are the same things in this place of deep worship, the place where 
reconciliation and healing takes place." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, people of every age attend Taize services, but in 
Europe, it is a phenomenon of youth: Every year, more than 100,000 pilgrims -- 
most under 30 -- visit the tiny town of Taize, tucked in the hills of Burgundy. 
Three times a day, they sit with the 90 or so Taize brothers, both Protestant 
and Catholic, in the Church of the Reconciliation to pray and chant. Most 
chants, often done in dim light or total darkness, are in Latin, but Polish, 
Greek and even Japanese are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Kittredge Cherry of the Metropolitan Community Church of Los Angeles, 
which sponsored a recent Taize festival in West Hollywood, spent Holy Week in 
the Burgundy town. "It was an awesome sight," she says. "All night long, 
youngsters from all over the world came and prostrated themselves at the 
church's cross. They'd just lie there and sob. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were tough kids, the kind you'd imagine with nails in their nose and 
tattoos on every limb," Kittredge says. "And when they'd get up, it looked as 
if terror had eroded from the world." Janet Kinosian

 FALLING OFF THE MAP: Lonely Places of the World by Pico Iyer (Vintage: $10; 
190 pp.). Pico Iyer's latest travel essays focus on countries that remain 
isolated geographically (Iceland, Australia), politically (Cuba, North Korea) 
or culturally (Bhutan, Paraguay).The tone ranges from deadpan mockery of the 
excesses of Paraguayan and North Korean dictators to a wistful elegy to the 
stark beauties of the Icelandic landscape under the midnight sun. The vivid 
narrative falters only in the chapter on Australia: The vast Outback seems to 
have daunted Iyer. Otherwise, his description of Saigon could be applied to his 
own lively prose: "You can no more rebuff it than you can a runaway train on a 
downhill slope. It's hard, it's made up, it's cunning, you tell yourself, and 
then you go out into the streets and find yourself swept up in the sheer power 
and vigor of it."

 UNDERSTANDING COMICS: The Invisible Art by Scott McCloud (HarperPerennial: 
$20; 216 pp.) . Despite their enormous popularity all over the world, comic 
strips and comic books have been the subject of remarkably little serious 
critical analysis. McCloud offer an unusually intelligent overview of the 
popular art form built on sequential visual images, usually juxtaposed with 
dialogue and/or verbal descriptions. Noting that this powerful medium has 
seldom been used for more than superficial entertainment in America, he 
stresses that its potential remains largely untapped. Readers may find 
themselves looking at familiar newspaper strips with new respect.

 A THOUSAND LEAGUES OF BLUE: The Sierra Club Book of the Pacific: A Literary 
Voyage edited by John A. Murray (Sierra Club: $16; 426 pp.). The Pacific Ocean 
and the lands it touches have inspired generations of authors, although only 
American and British writers appear in this anthology. The selections range 
from Captain Cook's description of Easter Island ("Nature has been exceedingly 
sparing of her favors to this spot," 1768) and Herman Melville's wry 
observation that America would benefit from Marquesan Islanders coming as 
missionaries (1846) to Barry Lopez's notes on the changing image of the 
Galapagos Islands (1993). The selections about the South Pacific are better 
chosen than the ones about the North; too many of the latter are devoted to 
Hawaii.

 LOVE POEMS FROM THE JAPANESE translated by Kenneth Rexroth, edited by Sam 
Hamill (Shambhala: $6; 129 pp., paperback original). Rexroth's subtle 
translations influenced a generation of American writers. As the examples in 
this miniature anthology demonstrate, he refused to flatten the text by 
spelling out every reference and allusion, preserving the Japanese ideal of 
offering a springboard for the reader's imagination. Although much of the 
imagery is graceful, not all of the verses embody the cliche of limpid 
fragility: "To love somebody/ Who doesn't love you,/ Is like going to a temple/ 
And worshipping the behind/ Of a wooden statue/ Of a hungry devil" (Lady Kasa).

 THE APPLAUSE PERFORMING ARTS GUIDE TO LOS ANGELES & SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA by 
Carey Simon (Applause: $15.95; 479 pp., paperback original). This remarkably 
thorough guide lists literally hundreds of theaters, music and dance 
performance, clubs, art film screenings, festivals and children's 
entertainments, including seating charts, addresses, phone numbers, handicapped 
access, etc. Although descriptions are a little too uniformly upbeat (the 
reader misses the critical comments of the Zagat restaurant surveys), this 
excellent resource belongs by the phone of every Southern Californian who has 
to entertain visiting relatives -- or enjoys the region's diverse cultural 
offerings.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; DOC HOLLYWOOD

 Rachel Ballon is a different kind of script doctor. Instead of curing 
screenplays of flawed dialogue, unrealistic characters and phony conflicts, she 
focuses on mending the people who write them.Her specialty is helping writers 
cope with life in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people come into my office, I tell them to put their scripts away," says 
Ballon, a Westwood-based psychotherapist. "We talk about childhood rejections, 
sibling jealousy, mother complexes and father Angst, personal life experiences. 
These are the roadblocks the writer has to resolve in order to write and sell a 
screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
 From A-list screenwriters to beginners, Ballon has nursed hundreds of troubled 
screenwriters and novelists through their internal struggles. "I had one man, a 
fairly successful screenwriter, who complained his characters were shallow and 
he'd run dry of emotions to give them. Our big breakthrough was when he sobbed, 
mourning a terrible relationship with his father. That cured his writer's 
block." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballon has personal experience dealing with Tinseltown tensions: She wrote 
several episodes of "The New Love American Style" and has had screenplays 
optioned by Warner Bros. and Paramount. She has also taught at USC, UCLA and 
the American Film Institute, and her book "Blueprint for Writing" (Lowell 
House) was published earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we are all given life scripts; they begin when we are born," she 
says. "We often choose to forget a lot of the emotional details. Everyone needs 
to get in touch with the real pain in order to find the passion." Kathleen 
Moloney

<P>
 Creator of asphyxiant worlds in which characters moved about the everyday 
emptiness, Uruguayan author Juan Carlos Onetti, who died at 85 on May 30, was 
an atypical participant of the Latin American "boom" of the Sixties. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the media attention given to other writers such as Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa, Onetti, born in Montevideo in 1909, for years 
preferred to avoid public appearances in order to remain in bed with his two 
inseparable companions -- his wife and a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Onetti, remembered by his generation colleagues as an almost crude being, who, 
in his youth, used to stroll aimlessly through the city, began generating 
almost religious followers after his first short story published in 1932 and 
his first novel, "El Pozo," in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalistic and mostly sparing in his literary descriptions, Onetti utilized 
a detached language that achieved something critics couldn't stop praising -- 
the creation of an oppressive yet captivating atmosphere that produced a 
strange mix of fascination and desperation in the reader. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of other books such as "El Astillero" and "Juntacadaveres," which 
transformed him in a sort of living myth, Onetti abandoned Uruguay in 1974, 
soon after the military took over, changing his residence to Madrid. He refused 
to return to his birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 In a famous controversy among writers, Onetti himself defined what he 
considered his essential method of approaching literary creation. "Some are 
married to literature, but I'm only her lover," he said in one of the rare 
interviews he gave. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the colorful appearance of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Macondo in the 
collective Latin American literary imagination, Onetti had founded the 
imaginary city of Santa Maria, in which he mixed the fogs, panoramic views and 
low passions of the inhabitants of Montevideo and Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Honored in 1980 with the Premio Cervantes, the maximum prize given for 
Hispanic literature, in occasional articles Onetti liked to remember his stint 
as editor of prestigious Uruguayan weekly Marcha and as a staff writer for the 
Reuter news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 With his slow and complex style, impenetrable for most, the old surly " el 
viejo hurano ," as he was affectionately called by Uruguayan writers, finally 
achieved something that ironically seems taken from his own stories -- he was 
much more respected than read. 
</P>

 "Body Snatcher," translated by Alfred M. Adam, is available from Pantheon. 
"Goodbyes and Stories," translated by Daniel Balderston, is available from the 
Texas University Press, "Shipyard" and "Juan Carlos Onetti: A Brief Life" are

RETRO; THE WONDER OF WYATT; MIXING THE OLD SERIES WITH NEW SCENES BRINGS EARP 
BACK TO TV -- AND TOMBSTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Costner provided the inspiration for the new movie "Wyatt Earp: Return 
to Tombstone," airing Saturday on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Costner starred in the 1990 Oscar winner "Dances With Wolves," which 
began a resurgence in Westerns, small and large. And his latest film, "Wyatt 
Earp," opened in theaters June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 But, more significant to the creation of the TV "Wyatt" movie, Costner starred 
in the 1991 box-office hit "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves." Both Robin Hood and 
Wyatt Earp were the subjects of popular '50s TV series. When Costner's "Robin 
Hood" project was announced, producer Rob Word realized there would be interest 
in the old "Adventures of Robin Hood" series. 
</P>
<P>
 When no one wanted the episodes because they were in black and white, Word 
culled material from old episodes to create three movies, or "featurizations": 
He colorized them, added new music and sold them in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Return to Tombstone" is a similar but fancier featurization of ABC's 1955-61 
Western series, "The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp," which starred Hugh O'Brian 
as the famed lawman. This time around, Word filmed new segments with O'Brian 
reprising his Earp role. The story line has Earp returning to Tombstone in 1914 
to solve a mystery. While there, he flashes back to scenes from his past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wyatt didn't die until he was 80 years old," Word says, "so we were able to 
revisit Tombstone and shoot in Tombstone, which believe it or not, no Wyatt 
Earp movie had ever filmed." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Word and his editors seven months to assemble "Return to Tombstone" 
from the more than 200 episodes of the original series. Still, he says, "this 
was easier to do than the 'Robin Hoods' because we were able to have modern 
transitions." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Wyatt Earp" series hasn't been in syndication in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he loved the series as a youngster, Word admits it's quite dated. "The 
rhythm of it ... the pacing's slow. That's why we did have to go into other 
episodes to find reaction shots. We'd find reaction shots of principals who 
were in the scene and then colorize the background to match where the location 
was for what I needed. We were able to change the pacing, make it more 
contemporary and more entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Word shot the new material in black and white and then colorized it, he says, 
"so we could have the choices we wanted, so we would blend from the new story 
to the flashbacks without any sort of jarring feel. It's just incredible how 
much better the colorizing has become. It's a pleasing look." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, Word says, has an option for two more featurizations. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Word adds, "We're talking about doing 26 first-run hour spinoffs with it. 
Most first-run shows in syndication like "The Untouchables" cost $1.5 million. 
We can do first-run hours for $450,000." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone" airs Saturday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

'FINDING AN OLD SHOE THAT FITS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh O'Brian laughs when asked if he was excited about reprising his role as 
Wyatt Earp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, at this age, it's good to get excited," he quips. "It was a lot of 
fun, kind of like finding a nice old shoe that fits," the robust 69-year-old 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we did the series, there were an awful lot of people who came on the set 
who knew Wyatt Earp," recalls O'Brian, who devotes most of his time helping 
young people with his organization, the Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation. "Some of 
them were people he'd put away and had just got out of prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Earp died in Los Angeles in 1929 at the age of 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Because O'Brian played Earp for so many years, he says, "I'm pretty close to 
the old gent and fond of his style. He was a very relaxed individual. But when 
he moved, look out. He was kind of like a coiled spring." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brian wanted to make everything as authentic as possible on the series, 
including the action sequences. "Whenever there was somebody I was going to 
grab, or one way or another come in physical contact with, they always had two 
or three extra vests and shirts. If I was supposed to grab a guy, a lot of time 
the vest came right off. They are colorizing this as you know, but I always kid 
that it was shot in black and blue to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brian reports that some 8,000 fans lined the streets during the filming of 
"Return to Tombstone," which marks the first time a Wyatt Earp movie actually 
has been shot in the famed Arizona locale. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came as far away as New Jersey and Florida. Maybe they thought Sharon 
Stone was going to be there! It was fun to see that many people, but what was 
also amazing was when I first walked down the street to do one of the scenes, 
someone started to sing the 'Wyatt Earp' theme song. Everybody joined in. I 
stopped a bit and laughed with them and made the mistake of saying, 'I am going 
to give $5 to anybody who knows the second verse.' I think I lost $300 real 
quick." SUSAN KING

 Neon colors and dizzying prints are fine for high-energy aerobics, but yoga 
calls for workout clothes more in keeping with the exercise's slow, deliberate 
stretching and meditative breathing.The latest looks include palettes and 
patterns that reflect nature's serenity: soft watercolors and pretty florals 
for women, simple charcoal and other solid neutrals for men. Cotton and Lycra 
are more absorbent and "breathable" than before, making clothes both stylishly 
snug and comfortable. Yoga contributes to a sense of quiet well-being; now what 
you wear can, too. ROCHELLE SPEARMAN

THE MEAT OF THE MATTER; RIB EYE, NEW YORK STRIP OR PORTERHOUSE: AT RUTH'S 
CHRIS, BEEFED-UP FARE IS BIG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 And where are you off to tonight?" my mother asked, just as we were about to 
hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to eat a prime New York strip lavished in butter," I told her with 
some glee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, lord," groaned the daughter of a cattle rancher, who's been on a strict 
low-fat diet for weeks. "That sounds so good!" 
</P>
<P>
 It is, believe me, it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth's Chris was the place, part of the New Orleans-based steakhouse chain. 
Rebuilt after a 1990 fire, the Beverly Hills location is particularly handsome. 
The owners have wisely eschewed the Neanderthal caveman or overbearing 
men's-club look of some other steakhouses, settling instead for warm wood 
wainscoting, frosted-glass light fixtures and graceful curved leather booths. 
Banished are the old-timey photos and memorabilia of the standard steakhouse; 
the walls are mercifully plain. Even the flowers are not what you'd expect: 
orchids.  
</P>
<P>
 Slightly elevated, the posh semicircular booths seat four comfortably and feel 
positively regal for two. To one side of the bar is a narrow dining room for 
smokers -- booths that are considerably quieter than the main nonsmoking dining 
room.  
</P>
<P>
 Five of us recently squeezed into a booth in the bar to indulge in an orgy of 
meat eating. The menu at Ruth's Chris, short on appetizers and other 
diversions, cuts quickly to the chase. We ordered the humongous Porterhouse -- 
three pounds for two people or six pounds for four -- the rib-eye, the New York 
strip and the filet, which just about exhausts the steak selection. All you 
need to know is the cut you prefer and how you like it cooked.  
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the menu is a crib list of steak-cooking terms, as the 
restaurant defines them: rare (very red, cool center); medium rare (red, warm 
center); medium (pink center). Does anyone ever venture beyond medium rare? I 
couldn't help inquiring. "We have people come in and order well done," our 
server admitted. For that, you might as well cook a supermarket steak at home. 
But I noted that steaks here come out a tad more cooked than I envision from 
the descriptions. Rare seems to veer a little toward the medium rare, and 
medium rare is more cooked than I like. On two occasions, my steak, ordered 
rare, had a warm center, not a cool one.  
</P>
<P>
 The Porterhouse, cut off the bone, charred on the outside and juicy rare 
within, was a marvelous piece of meat. The filet is excellent; however good, 
though, I prefer a firmer cut of meat, such as the New York strip, the most 
flavorful of the cuts. That night we ordered the lamb chops, too, purely for 
science. These were perfectly tender, double-cut lamb chops, which I would have 
enjoyed with great relish anyplace else.  
</P>
<P>
 Steak aficionados can argue endlessly about the virtues of Arnie Morton's 
steaks versus those at the Palm or Ruth's Chris. I happen to favor the latter's 
prime, aged beef. And the way Ruth's Chris cooks the steaks (charbroiled at 
extremely high temperatures) seems to seal in the maximum juices. The Palm's 
informal atmosphere is fun, but I wouldn't go back for the steaks or the 
monstrous lobsters. At Arnie Morton's, the poor waiter waves plastic-wrapped 
steaks and live lobsters in front of your face, all the while keeping up a 
frantic, scripted spiel, an embarrassingly hokey spectacle. And of the three 
main contenders, Ruth's Chris definitely has the best side dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I like to start with the thick, chilled slices of tomato and onion 
slathered with Italian or remoulade dressing, but the Caesar salad is 
disappointing, weighed down with strands of cheese and ordinary croutons. The 
French-fried onion rings, big as bracelets, are just OK. The shoestring 
potatoes are quite good, the cottage fries not so good if you forget to order 
them extra crispy. A fine-textured baked potato is served with all the fixings: 
crumbled bacon, sour cream, butter and grated cheddar. 
</P>
<P>
 I can have a fine solo dining experience here, too. I'll usually start with a 
martini (somehow, it seems like that kind of place) and proceed to the shrimp 
cocktail: five fat shrimp, chilled, with a cocktail sauce that packs some 
punch. The steak arrives swiftly after. When they say sizzling here, they are 
serious. The plate is so hot, by all rights it should be in melt-down. And yes, 
there is an audible sizzle and the enticing aroma of butter and charred meat. 
</P>
<P>
 I have two favorites here: the Porterhouse or, if I can't persuade anyone else 
to join me, the New York strip. I'll add either the creamed spinach or the 
whole sauteed mushrooms, each about the size of a walnut, with the unmistakable 
flavor of the forbidden: butter. And just recently, the restaurant started 
serving garlic mashed potatoes, laced with a few homespun lumps.  
</P>
<P>
 And maybe, just maybe, if I can make it to dessert, I'll have a bit of the 
moist, straightforward bread pudding in whiskey sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish only that the middle-of-the-road wine list offered more choices of the 
same caliber as the beef. There are few exciting selections, and vintage years 
are not given for all. When we're talking steak, we're talking red wine. For a 
splurge, the big, rich 1981 Niebaum Coppola Cabernet ($58) or the 1990 Jordan 
($43, also offered by the glass at $8). A less expensive choice is the 1991 
Ridge (York Creek) Zinfandel ($20). 
</P>
<P>
 All those wines hold their own against major meat -- a subject my mom knows 
well. She understands how much marbling and aging have to do with flavor. If 
it's not a great prime steak, it's simply not worth the calories. I'm not going 
to tempt her, but next time she's ready to break out for a once-in-a-diet 
indulgence, I know exactly where I'm going to lead her astray. 
</P>

 MARILYN HORNE: Lullabies. Marilyn Horne, mezzo-soprano; Martin Katz, piano; 
orchestra, conductor uncredited. BMC 09026-60278-2. Twenty-nine lullabies from 
Bach to Portia Nelson, with the mezzo sometimes using electronic trickery to 
sing duets with herself, might seem a bit sticky even for the most devoted 
parent.Oddly enough, Horne often pulls it off. Standouts are the Montsalvage 
"Ninghe, Ninghe," the American folk song "All the Pretty Little Horses," 
Puccini's "E' l'uccellino" and Ginastera's "Arrorro." You can skip 
"Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral," "Baby Mine" from "Dumbo" and Irving Berlin's "Russian 
Lullaby." Decidedly not top-draw Gershwin is "Lonely Boy," wisely cut from 
"Porgy and Bess." Horne, some occasional pitch problems aside, is in good vocal 
shape, and she chooses low keys that show her to current best advantage. Katz 
is, as always, a fine collaborator. WALTER PRICE

 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Post-bop combo Black/Note has done more for the L.A. jazz scene than any group 
in recent memory. The band's jump to a major label is the envy of the handful 
of L.A. ensembles that plow the same ground on the revitalized Crenshaw jazz 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In its favor, Black/Note functions as a unit -- no single member is being 
touted as the next big thing. But Black/Note does fit the record business's 
infatuation with revivalism. Its sound leans heavily toward the Jazz Messengers 
model that Art Blakey and others established in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-original program here, most of which was penned by fine bassist Mark 
Shelby, provides enough twists and turns on the neo-bop tradition to sound 
fresh, though the lack of strong melodic and rhythmic hooks (with the exception 
of "Fourth Grade") imparts a cool distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc's standout moments are those of interplay, most notably on Shelby's 
"Dreams of Elizabeth Brown," in which the exchange between alto saxophonist 
James Mahone, trumpeter Gilbert Castellanos and tenorman Phil Vieux are glove 
tight and intertwine like clasped hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The soloists, led by Mahone, provide enough modern insight to keep "Jungle 
Music" from sounding totally derivative. Though charter member Vieux falls 
short of Mahone's smartness, his tenor trades with the altoman on "Evil Dancer" 
are fat and belligerent. Both trumpeter Castellanos and pianist Ark Sano ramble 
along nicely on "Fifth Street Dick's," while drummer Willie Jones III is ably 
responsive to the horns and persistently inventive during solos throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they're not yet top-rung musicians, the members of Black/Note are 
poised, and determined enough, to take the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good, recommended) and four stars (excellent). BILL KOHLHAASE

 Luchino Visconti's sumptuous 1963 film of the Giuseppe di Lampedusa novel is 
set against Italy's turbulent 1860s, and compares with "Gone With the Wind" as 
an evocation of an aristocracy crumbling in war. It has battle scenes, a grand 
ball and a pragmatic survivor as a protagonist.A glorious triumph of personal 
expression, it is an example of the historical epic as an art film. Burt 
Lancaster is superb as a Sicilian aristocrat who laments the passing of his 
privileged world yet understands why it must inevitably be destroyed. With 
Alain Delon (pictured) as Lancaster's beloved nephew and Claudia Cardinale as

CRITIC'S PICK: 'EL CID'

 This 1961 super spectacle about the man (Charlton Heston, pictured with Sophia 
Loren) who drove the Moors out of Spain is the kind of movie they don't make 
anymore: a vast pageant, loaded with decor and furious action. Romance, 
swashbuckling jousts, sword fights and grand battle scenes -- with 5,000 
soldiers of the Spanish army acting as extras in the climax -- combine for this 
historical extravaganza. Produced by Samuel Bronston, directed by Anthony Mann 
and written by Philip Yordan, Fredric M. Frank and the uncredited blacklist 
victim Ben Barzman, it paints a corrupt, obsessive Spanish court filled with 
cruel intrigue and perverse psychological (NBC Sunday at 7 p.m.). Michael

CRITIC'S PICK: 'GETTYSBURG'

<P>
By Peter Rainer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When this uneven 1993 release, ironically originally planned as a TV 
miniseries, is at its best, director Robert Maxwell makes us forget the fakery 
involved and realize the enormity of this chapter in America. With the action 
confined to the three climactic days in the summer of 1863, when 150,000 Union 
and Confederate soldiers squared off in the bloodiest battle of the Civil War, 
the film emerges as neither a work of great feeling or depth.But it has 
integrity. Jeff Daniels as the North's Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and the 
late Richard Jordan as the South's Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead manage to inject 
some real feeling into the film's historical posturing. With a large impressive 
cast, including Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang, from left (TNT Part 1: Sunday at 
5 and 8 p.m., Thursday at 5 p.m.; Part 2: Monday at 5 and 8 p.m.). Peter Rainer

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; VH-1'S JONATHAN ROSS KEEPS AN INTERVIEW GOING WITH WIT 
AND IRREVERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You've become the object of um, ah, what's the word I'm looking for, to be 
polite?" Jonathan Ross asks Chris Isaak, the singer with the matinee-idol 
looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disgust?" Isaak suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lust," Ross responds. "In a certain section of the population . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Male prisoners?" Isaak says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect, yes," Ross says quickly. "Especially heavy-set guys . . . 
whichever sex, you've become a lust object." After a few more give-and-take 
questions, Ross hits a philosophical wry note: "Life is a bowl of cherries and 
you've got to reach in and grab one!" 
</P>
<P>
 Long popular on Brit TV, the Englishman came to American audiences' attention 
when he interviewed Madonna in 1992 during the promotion of the pop diva's 
controversial book "Sex." That interview, originally intended to air in Great 
Britain only, appeared on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Ross' wit, candor and well-researched questions that not only put 
Madonna at ease, but any other celebrity put in front of the camera alongside 
him. For the Isaak interview, Ross and the celebrity sat across from each other 
on twin beds in a tacky motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of his more scandal-seeking countrymen, the host of VH-1's 
"Jonathan Ross Presents" chooses to pose questions that allow his guests to 
show their personalities and reveal only as much as they like. He's been able 
to put his sense of humor about others, as well as himself, to good use. 
</P>
<P>
 One might like to consider Ross as a kind of "English David Letterman" (whom 
he greatly admires), but he describes himself as "a fatter Arsenio, a just 
bemusing, generally lisping, slightly offbeat, pansy Brit who's irreverent." 
</P>
<P>
 For his longer-than-usual interviews -- one guest gets the entire half-hour -- 
Ross tries to "have a conversation, rather than a traditional interview. It's 
more fun and entertaining and quite adult." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his now infamous talk with Madonna, Ross says, "I asked to interview her 
during 'Truth or Dare' and she put in for another talk show and promised to do 
me next time around. I thought it was a polite way of saying 'go away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But when she actually did call back, Ross jumped on the opportunity. While he 
wasn't a fan going in, he was by the end of the interview. "I bloody enjoyed it 
and was totally won over by her," even though she uttered one of her favorite 
obscenities 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was surprised at how often the Madonna interview was repeated in both the 
United States and England. "I was sick of the sight of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other profiles: Gloria Estefan, Michael Bolton, Phil Collins, Johnny 
Depp, Burt Reynolds, Tom Jones, Cindy Crawford, Billy Joel, Emma Thompson, 
Meatloaf and Barry Manilow. 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting interviews he's done are of people who "lost it and then 
got it back again," such as Meatloaf, he says. They are people "who offer 
perspectives from both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross finds that American journalists are more apt to be polite and be 
"hypocritical and only hint at things," whereas "the British just take things 
further." He concludes that "Americans are slightly more inhibited" in their 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross modestly points out that he would never presume to know what the American 
audience wants, even though it seems he's successfully tapped into it. Ross, 
whose background includes a degree in modern European history from London 
University, is also a documentarian. His three-part "Americana," shot 
throughout the country, consisted of the shorts "Fat," "Dumb" and "Rich." "It's 
an affectionate look at the excesses of American life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent dad -- he and journalist wife Jane Goldman have a newborn son, 
Harvey Kirby, and a 2-year-old daughter, Betty -- returns to the United States 
this week to do a Barbara Walters-style interview show with Johnny Cash, Paul 
Reiser, Dennis Miller and Vanessa Williams that precedes "VH-1 Honors." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jonathan Ross Presents" airs Wednesdays at 4 p.m.; Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. 
and 4 p.m.; and Sundays at 10 a.m. on VH-1. His "VH-1 Honors" special airs 
Sunday at 4 and 7:30 p.m.

WEREWOLVES OF FILMDOM

<P>
 AHHAHOOOOO !! Susan King's omission of my TV series from her list on 
werewolves has wounded me like a rusty trap ("Howling Through the Ages," June 
12)! 
</P>
<P>
 Although I am not a werewolf, I have an affinity for them.For I was Lucan, the 
boy raised by wolves, in the 1977-79 ABC series of that name. 
</P>
<P>
 Before sinking my fangs into my paw for being slighted, may I say I would have 
enjoyed being on her list!

 In your list of werewolf films, you neglected to list the funniest horror film 
ever produced: "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
 In this 1948 Universal classic, Lon Chaney Jr. once more portrays doomed 
Lawrence Talbot, who tries to warn the boys about his reaction to a full moon: 
"You see, in a half-hour the moon will rise and I'll turn into a wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, you and 30 million other guys," Costello quips.

AFTER MAGRITTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too bad Anna Deavere Smith ("The Tangle Over Twilight," by Sean Mitchell, June 
12) didn't just paint a picture of a pipe and write under it, "This is not a 
pipe." There's a precedent for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the Pulitzer Prize jury or the Tony nominating committee have been 
enlightened if, during Smith's entire performance, there was a sign overhead 
reading, "This is not real life"? 
</P>
<P>
 If Man Ray can exhibit found art or John Cage can string together gathered 
sounds, why is Smith seen as so out of the norm because she uses material 
garnered from interviews? 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the painter and the composer spend time deciding what found objects or 
sounds to use to elicit a desired response from the viewer or audience, so did 
Smith edit hours of tapes and present what was left just so, to give the 
audience a particular set of emotions, to help viewers understand what she and 
those interviewed felt about a certain subject or event. 
</P>
<P>
 In his commentary, Mitchell made good arguments and gave several examples that 
show that what Smith has done is just the next step from what has gone before 
in the theater, rather than some grand departure. 
</P>

 I was so excited after reading Mitchell's commentary. I mean, if all it takes 
to get nominated for a Tony is transcribing interviews, my new show is a 
shoe-in for best play next year. 
</P>
<P>
 I've interviewed more than 200 audience members coming out of a theater in Los 
Angeles. Their fear of not being politically correct has left them unable to 
distinguish theater from "Hard Copy." My impersonations are nothing more than 
bad caricatures, but hey, so were Anna Deavere Smith's, and she got nominated 
for best actress. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm still up in the air as far as the title goes. It's between "8 p.m., Mark 
Taper Forum, 1993" or "The Emperor's New Clothes." See you at the Tonys!

 Regarding "Slipping Tony a Mickey?" by Patrick Pacheco (June 12): 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Sondheim is a genius with lyrics, but his choice of subject matter 
often fails to connect with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 I would much rather pay to see a revival of "Carousel" or "She Loves Me" than 
any recent Sondheim show I've seen. Both of these shows were on the "artistic 
cutting edge" when originally produced, but they also could connect with the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway producers need to encourage new composers with fresh ideas that do 
connect to come back to theater. Suggestion: Alan Menken.

 Regarding "After All, Life Isn't Just a Video," by Daniel Cerone (June 12): 
</P>
<P>
 It's always a riot when those that create a system condemn it, as if they had 
nothing to do with its invention. 
</P>
<P>
 The bedding down of the record companies with MTV a few years back killed off 
virtually all non-MTV airing of music videos.The granting of exclusives on 
broadcast rights of videos by superstar artists moved them from a marketing 
tool to a bargaining chip assuring extensive play. 
</P>
<P>
 The hands were washing each other pretty raw for a while. Now, when one of the 
kids wants to take his marbles and go home (or to the bank), everyone left 
behind gripes. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole MTV/record company/artist co-dependence (best exemplified by the 
"Unplugged" franchise) would have gotten Alan Freed the chair in the '50s, if 
he had thought of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess I keep forgetting that yesterday's conflicts of interest are today's 
vital marketing synergies.

THE RIFLE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to Michael Walker's piece on novelist Jim Harrison ("When the Wolf 
Howls," June 12): 
</P>
<P>
 It is both hilarious and frankly not a little frightening, in this locus of 
anti-gun hysteria, that The Times would edit a quote from this fine writer 
thusly: "By which time I was ready to take out my .270 (shotgun) and blow them 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 "Two-seventy" refers to the .270 Winchester cartridge, a necked-down version 
of the venerable 30-06 that has long remained the standard American deer 
rifle.It is not a shotgun. Shotguns shoot shot, not bullets, and are in fact 
called shotguns for that very reason. To describe a .270 as a shotgun is as 
informed as to describe a refrigerator as having four burners and an oven. 
</P>
<P>
 Your corrective error at another point in our political history would have 
simply been a source of amusement among knowledgeable people. Unfortunately, 
with a majority of the media now constantly propagandizing voters with 
inappropriate and often downright misleading firearms terms, it represents 
another prideful and arrogant step toward the certainty that universities and 
newspapers teach the truth and real life does not.

IRVING MEADOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've always enjoyed reading Pop Eye, but June 12 I couldn't believe my eyes. 
It seems you've bought some Hollywood propaganda hook, line and sinker 
("Blockbuster Blockage"). 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Azoff co-owns Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. He also manages the Eagles 
(no big secret). Why do you fail to mention this important tidbit in your piece 
on the Eagles at Blockbuster Pavilion? 
</P>
<P>
 I attended the Eagles' show at Blockbuster and have attended many shows at 
Irvine Meadows. It takes me 2 1/2 hours to get in and out of Irvine Meadows for 
any show! The old Lion Country Safari ran better traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems pretty clear to me that the owner of Irvine Meadows is slinging mud 
at what is clearly a bigger, better-run amphitheater down the road. But if The 
Times is going to join in throwing the mud, you should at least find out the 
real agenda before you do it.

TIPS ON TIPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if the waiter profession weren't demeaning enough, now comes "snitching" 
(Restaurant News, June 5). Kathie Jenkins' article portrays waiters as 
oppressive and restaurant patrons as their helpless victims.Her article also 
suggests that waiters need to be kept in line. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I'm not a disgruntled waiter, just the boyfriend of one. I dine frequently 
at her restaurant (a Beverly Hills eatery that recently enjoyed a glowing 
review in your paper) and get the privilege of seeing firsthand the arrogance, 
intolerance and cheapness with which she and her ilk are treated, regardless of 
the quality of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiters pay taxes on a fixed percentage of sales, but in one of the remaining 
professions where customers are able to evaluate the service and pay 
accordingly, people are rarely as fair as Uncle Sam assumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Fred Eric, chef-owner of Vida, many patrons are not shy about 
appearing cheap. A medical doctor recently tipped my girlfriend a whopping 4% 
after thanking her for a fantastic meal; the tip, as is customary in 
restaurants, was later divided among busboys, bartenders and hostesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unnecessary to have restaurateurs summoning the critiques of implacable 
diners to further the humiliation of waiters -- they are already treated as 
servile. It's the customers who need some work.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CHANGING JOBS: WHAT ABOUT 401(K)? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I am leaving my job at a company where I have a 401(k) account and 
will be joining one where I won't be eligible to contribute to a 401(k) plan 
for a year. What should I do with my existing account? Should I roll it over to 
an individual retirement account and then into my new employer's 401(k) when I 
am eligible? -- P.S . 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You may certainly have your 401(k) account transferred to a separate 
rollover IRA. But be careful. Under rules that took effect in January, 1993, 
taxpayers cashing out of their old employers' 401(k) or other qualified pension 
plans will be slapped with a 20% withholding tax on the disbursement if they 
take possession of the money rather than have it transferred directly to a 
qualified employer pension plan or an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 You may transfer the funds later from that IRA into a 401(k) account with your 
new employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware that federal rules require that you withdraw the after-tax 
contributions you made to the 401(k) before you transfer the remainder of the 
account to an IRA. There is no penalty for this distribution because you 
already paid tax on the money before you put it into the 401(k) account. Your 
employer is required to keep records distinguishing your before- and after-tax 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be an easier choice, though: leaving your account with your old 
employer the way it is. Under federal law, an employer cannot force you to 
withdraw money from your account without your permission, unless the account 
contains less than $3,500 or the employee has reached the retirement age 
specified in the company's 401(k) rules.  
</P>
<P>
 The $3,500 rule includes both employee contributions and any matching funds 
contributed by the employer. Of course, once you leave, neither you nor the 
previous employer will be making contributions, but the account will continue 
to accumulate tax-deferred interest. Later, when you are eligible to join your 
new employer's 401(k) plan, you can transfer your old account. 
</P>
<P>
 One more bit of advice: If you decide to leave your 401(k) with your previous 
employer, be sure to check the plan's rules to determine the terms for 
reclaiming your money in the future. You do not want to give up easy access to 
your funds, especially because you are severing your relationship with your 
employer.  
</P>
<P>
 Because readers ask so many questions so often about 401(k) plans, we have

Contributions for Married Couples 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will you please explain the rules for contributions by married couples to 
individual retirement accounts? 
</P>
<P>
 C.F.  
</P>
<P>
 A. Couples in which both spouses are working may contribute up to $4,000 a 
year into their IRAs. If one of the spouses works part time, he or she may 
contribute up to $2,000 in earnings a year. (For example, if a spouse earns a 
total of $1,850 in the year working as a child-care provider or free-lance 
writer, all those earnings may be put into an IRA.)  
</P>
<P>
 If one of the spouses is not employed, the maximum contribution is $2,250 a 
year. A couple's contribution of $2,250 may be divided between the accounts of 
the two spouses any way the couple chooses. It does not have to be split along 
the lines of $2,000 for the spouse who is employed and $250 for the spouse who 
is not. However, when both spouses are employed, each spouse must keep separate 
IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, let's address the question of whether these IRA contributions are 
tax-deductible. If you are not covered by a qualified pension plan through your 
employer, you are entitled to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA 
under any circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
 If you are an "active participant" in a qualified pension plan, such as a 
401(k), you are still allowed to have an IRA, but your contribution to it will 
be tax-deductible only if you meet specific income limits. Couples filing a 
joint return are entitled to a fully deductible IRA contribution if their 
adjusted gross income does not exceed $40,000. The deduction decreases 
gradually, ending at an adjusted gross income of $50,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Individuals with an adjusted gross income of less than $25,000 are entitled to 
a fully deductible IRA. The deduction gradually declines, ending at an adjusted 
gross income of $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if your IRA contribution is not tax-deductible, its earnings are not 
taxed until they are withdrawn. Assuming a 10% rate of return, the benefits of 
compound interest will turn a $2,000-a-year contribution into $114,550 in 20 
years and into nearly $329,000 in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, whether your IRA is tax-deductible is entirely separate from how 
much a couple may contribute into these accounts. A couple in which only one 
spouse is employed is entitled to a maximum IRA contribution of $2,250 
regardless of whether the contribution is tax-deductible. The fact that the 
contribution is not tax-deductible does not mean an unemployed spouse is 
entitled to make a full $2,000 contribution. Mother's Death Complicates Sale 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My mother sold her home but died before escrow closed. When it did close, 
my brother and I (my mother's only two heirs) shared the proceeds equally. How 
should this sale be reported to the IRS? -- W.D.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The sale should be reported on the income tax return filed by your mother's 
estate, if there is one. (This is not your mother's final income tax return, 
but any return filed by the estate.) If the estate is not large enough to 
require an income tax return, you and your brother should each report your 
share of the proceeds on your individual returns.  
</P>
<P>
 By the way, the proceeds you receive from the sale are not taxable, because 
the property would have been given a full step up in value upon your mother's 
death, eliminating any taxable gain to you and your brother.

 James Flanigan's foray into professional sports ("Football Owners Cry 
'Farewell' but Mean 'Welfare,' " May 29) was most unfortunate. He sounds like 
an unreconstructed socialist when he bemoans the lack of social duty by the 
owners of professional football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are: Al Davis was promised his box seats as a condition for moving 
to Los Angeles, a promise the Coliseum Commission quickly forgot about. The 
football owners have invested their lives and an enormous amount of capital in 
building up a successful franchise -- now everyone wants a piece of their 
action as their "due." 
</P>
<P>
 What has Los Angeles invested? When you can't ever fill the Coliseum for a 
championship team, you don't deserve a franchise. There are plenty of towns and 
cities all over the country that would give their eyeteeth for a championship 
team. All Los Angeles can do is complain about them.

GALLERY: SANDS OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the road between Barstow and Needles, time stops marching. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the heat, because in the near-vacant towns dotting the Mojave 
Desert, time ambles, rests, takes its time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's been change. Things have aged. Motel signs, once awash in neon 
urgency, now stare unblinking, ambivalent to boarders. And people have moved 
on. That's why gas pumps stand ready for service, but stand alone, frozen in an 
era when refueling cost 33 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 But people have stayed too. They patch together a living from the remnants of 
the past -- cafes that serve meatloaf and cream pies on checkered-cloth tables; 
auto part yards full of rusted cars abandoned on roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
 And entranced by the silence and mystery of the desert, they pledge 
allegiance. They amble through a life where nothing happens in an instance. 
They rest, they take their time. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the heat.

RSVP / THE SOCIAL CITY; DOLE TAKES LEADING ROLE IN TRIBUTE TO NIXON AS 
PEACEMAKER

 The "Architect of Peace" tribute to former President Richard Nixon, originally 
set for June 16 with Nixon as keynote speaker, has been rescheduled for July 13 
at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. Invitations went out 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Robert Dole has been asked to replace the late Nixon 
as keynoter. The original committee -- including Gov. Pete and Gayle Wilson as 
honorary dinner chairs, Lod and Carole Cook as dinner chairs, and Caroline 
Ahmanson and George and Judie Argyros as co-dinner chairs -- plans a 
$2,500-per-person candlelight White House-style state dinner created by Henry 
Haller, White House executive chef to Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Nixon, Gerald 
Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Nixon and his late wife, Pat, the library accepts no federal 
funding. Proceeds from the dinner will go to the annual $2.8-million operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowled Over: "It's the best Bowl season yet," president Joan Stubbs told 
Friends of the Hollywood Bowl at a luncheon in the Volunteer Cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends are prepping for the July 5 gala opening of the season, a 73-year-old 
Southern California tradition of music, picnics and friendship. American 
conductor Andrew Litton will lead the L.A. Philharmonic on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 On the committee: Susan Holt, Nancy Wayte, Jan Corey, Deanne Kelly, Rebecca 
O'Neill, Lynn Wolf and Katherine Yamada. Friends provide 100 volunteers to 
staff Open House at the Bowl (a summer-long festival of children's activities) 
and an additional 40 to staff the Bowl's gift shop. They expect to raise 
$75,000 for the Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer Festivities: In a world of nuclear turmoil, white lilies on celadon 
tablecloths and friendly exchanges among Los Angeles residents cast a festive 
spell on the "Korean Arts of the 18th Century" opening at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 It was William A. Mingst's first official affair as new president of museum 
trustees. The museum has received a generous grant of $275,000 from the Korea 
Foundation for a three-year educational outreach program designed to increase 
appreciation of Korean art and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent at the event were Korean Consul General Hang Kyung Kim; Ki Suh Park, 
chairman of the Festival of Korea for Southern California; festival vice 
chairman Jae Min Chang and director Sandy Yi; Vishaka Desai, director of 
galleries and vice president of the Asia Society, and Faranak Van Patten, 
executive director of the Asia Society/Southern California Center. Elsewhere on 
the Social Circuit 
</P>
<P>
 * Social events are swirling around debutante balls and teas now that the 
college set is home. In Bel-Air, at the home of Dody Booth, 25 debutantes 
arrived with their mothers and grandmothers to receive pink peony bouquets and 
stand in line to be introduced to members of Las Madrinas, the support group 
for Childrens Hospital. The debs will be honored at the Las Madrinas Debutante 
Ball on Dec. 22 at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving guests were Las Madrinas President Peggy Galbraith, debutante 
chairwoman Kay Onderdonk and ball chairwoman Susan Hull. The minted iced tea 
flowed and the brilliantly polished tea urns were resplendent around caterer 
Isabelle Linenberger's famous tea sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1933, the group honors families committed to community service. In 
1993, Las Madrinas completed its $3-million endowment and has begun a new 
$1.5-million endowment for molecular genetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Debutantes: Tarry Baker, Andrea Browne, Katherine Buster, Caitlin Carroll, 
Elizabeth Freeman, Marie Frere, Clare Gibbs, Jennifer Gilchrist, Kelly Graves, 
Michelle Harb, Suzanne Jones, Treadon Kraus, Margaret Magee, Amy McGaughey, 
Jennifer Moore, Katherine O'Keefe, Hilary Palmer, Katrina Roski, Chanel Scott, 
Alison Sweeney, Lynda Thomas, Jennifer Von Der Ahe, Kristen Wallace, Susan Webb 
and Melissa Wu. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guests might have been in an Italian villa with lacy rose garlands, clipped 
hedges and tables topped with Italian urns. It looked that way for the 33rd 
annual June Ball hosted by Pasadena Guild of Childrens Hospital at the 
Ritz-Carlton, Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving through the crowd were guild president June Banta, ball chairwoman 
Susan Seidel and debutante chairwoman Karen Hammond. Debs had the honor of 
being announced by Ulysses Grant Buchanan III, whose wife, Betsy, is a founding 
guild member. 
</P>
<P>
 The June Ball committee makes it clear that those participating understand the 
importance of contributions to Childrens Hospital. Thus, fathers and daughters 
toured the hospital together, and the debs' mothers toured with guild members. 
This year's proceeds support pediatric surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Debutantes: Melissa Bruce, Kristin Capalbo, Katie Coleman, Stephanie DeCastro, 
Heidi Gilbaugh, Kelly Martin, Galen Moore, Kristin Podley, Megan Rader, Susan 
Rusnack, Sarah Schoellkopf, Carrie Sullivan and Nicole Ogilvie. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History Director Craig C. Black and his 
wife, Elizabeth, are departing for Albuquerque, N.M., soon, but first they 
gathered friends at their Hancock Park residence to introduce director 
designate James Powell (coming from the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia) and 
his wife, Joan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laney and Tom Techentin hosted dinner in Pasadena to honor Ann and Olin 
Barrett on their 25th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kudos to the stalwart givers: James A. Thomas, honored by the Center for the 
Partially Sighted at a black-tie Beverly Hilton dinner . . . Caltech chemistry 
professor emeritus John D. Roberts, honored as a "history-maker" by the 
Pasadena Historical Museum at its Orange Blossom Ball, chaired by Karen Craig 
at the Ritz-Carlton, Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mayor Richard Riordan received the 1994 TELACU Creo Award from TELACU (the 
East Los Angeles Community Union) President and CEO David C. Lizarraga at a 
black-tie dinner at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 * Today at 2 p.m., the 55-piece all-volunteer Los Angeles Police Band, its new 
Highland Pipe Band and Mariachis perform at the Wilshire Ebell Theater, 4401 W. 
8th St. Tickets are $10 to $50.

 Information SigAlert? Out on the electronic frontier, with Al Gore doing the 
media tour on behalf of the Administration's policy on the use of cyberspace, 
more people are bemoaning the overwrought term Information Superhighway, which 
has even spun off further metaphors, such as Infobahn, Information Speed Limit 
and Information Passing Lane.  
</P>

Country Road, Information Driveway, Information Parking Lot and -- who knows? 
-- maybe even an Information Accident Investigation Site.

 Soccer Fans Exposed: Sure, Americans have a reputation for behaving boorishly 
abroad, but has anyone seen what's been going on around the Rose Bowl lately? 
During a recent trip to Pasadena, we've noticed a multinational throng parading 
around in nothing but boxers. And no, we're not talking about the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the exposed flesh we've been forced to confront definitely 
belongs to the World Cup's spectators. Perhaps it's time they hung up a sign at 
LAX saying, "No shirts, no shoes, no pants, no visa."

 Is Coffee Drinking Allowed?: So what's a funky coffeehouse space good for in 
this day and age? Well, this sign we saw at the Tropical Bakery in Silver Lake 
seems to cover all the bases. It says, "Back room available for poetry, music, 
acting, AA, CA, NA meetings, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 And if that alone doesn't tell you this is L.A. in the 90s, then the last line 
will: "No smoking."

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: REVELING IN PURE PLEASURE; IT'S A PLACE THAT

 The Pure Pleasure Lounge on Manchester Boulevard and Western Avenue is true to 
its name. This neighborhood joint swings sweet and low every Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday night, when Bobby Phillips and the Joy Sticks cry the blues to their 
friends and neighbors in Central L.A., and to anyone else who might love music 
and fraternity enough to come on down. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone is on a first-name basis here. Didi might very well give you a hug as 
you walk in. Frank might buy you a drink, and the way he greets you, you'd 
think he owned the place -- but he doesn't. He just loves it, and wants you to 
love it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is tending bar this night, although it isn't clear that he works here, 
and he, too, is proud enough to be the owner. "There's never been a fight here 
in almost 20 years. It's a safe place for a woman to come alone. We never have 
any trouble," Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Griffin, an engineer with the city of Los Angeles, opened the lounge in 
1976 as a hobby and is still tending bar nearly 20 years later. Open only on 
weekends, the lounge is often used for parties and fund-raisers, all of which 
are open to the public. Every other Friday there's a fish fry, and Sundays, the 
only time there's a cover charge, the house is packed for the weekly jam 
session when anyone who likes can stand up and take his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Phillips and the Joy Sticks have been in residence every Friday and 
Saturday night for two years, playing solid blues laced with funk. During the 
rest of the week, this band, which could put most of the headliners at the 
House of Blues to shame, isn't above playing the occasional back-yard barbecue. 
"We'll play in your bedroom, your back yard, on your roof, whatever you want to 
hear," Phillips says. "Blues, Top 40, jazz. Hell, we'll even play polker if 
that's what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Things get started about 11 o'clock as Phillips warms up the audience by 
calling out, "How many of you here are from Louisiana? Texas? Arkansas? How 
many of you from Los Angeles? Well, you're still from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's my TV mama," Phillips sings, bucking his hips, "got that big old wide 
screen." 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't room on the stage for the whole band, but Phillips seems happiest 
roaming the floor with his mike, mingling with the crowd. At one point he gets 
right up close to a slow-dancing couple, horning in on their embrace, singing, 
"Lady, please don't walk away . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 When Phillips takes a break, Black Speed, the keyboardist, assumes the vocals 
with a singing style that's harder, more urgent and just as astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone visiting here for the first time is likely to feel they've struck gold, 
but more exciting still is the realization that this level of artistry at a 
neighborhood joint is a part of the everyday life of this community. Central 
Avenue may be gone, but everything it stood for is right here, right now.

TEACHERS SHOULD STICK TO THE BASICS, RATHER THAN 'LIFE LESSONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One does not have to be an arch conservative, book burner or fundamentalist to 
be seriously disturbed by the goings-on in Lucy Swindell's sophomore English 
class at Kennedy High in La Palma ("Teaching Life Lessons," June 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Those who focus on her choice of books miss the point entirely. Such teachers 
will not be deterred if a particular book is removed. They will just find 
another as a fulcrum for their forays into amateur psychology. After all, 
"Romeo and Juliet," a classroom staple for generations, is also about suicide, 
sex and teen-age pain and could lend itself to the same therapeutic application 
as "Ordinary People." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the implications: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a compulsory setting, students are asked to reveal deeply personal, often 
painful family experiences without any assurance of confidentiality such as any 
therapist must provide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because the revelations are an integral part of an English course, do they 
become part of the work the students submit? How are such expressions graded? 
Is the reticent pupil downgraded? What of those who lead happy family lives 
with no trauma worth talking about? 
</P>
<P>
 * Teachers who insist students express their emotions may find themselves 
tragically unprepared for the consequences. Involuntary therapy performed on 
children in a volatile classroom setting sandwiched between gym and lunch 
impresses me as the epitome of irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish Swindell could be a fly on the wall in my community college class in 
business communications. I get students who are two to 10 years removed from 
high school. Most have been through a Swindell-style classroom and are angry 
and frustrated that so much time was spent on feelings at the expense of real 
teaching and learning. As adults, many still struggle with the rudiments of 
English they could have easily mastered in high school when they were not 
holding down full-time jobs and raising families.

<P>
 I have no objection to any book being taught in high school, and Judith 
Guest's "Ordinary People" is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 I do object to teachers using literature classes to teach "life's lessons." By 
doing this, Swindell validates the accusation that our school systems are more 
interested in promoting social agendas than in teaching basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Life's lessons should be taught by those well qualified to do so -- parents, 
gurus and perhaps even life itself.

 I would not, in an English class, expect to be quizzed about my family life or 
discuss the problems facing teens and their parents or teen suicide or sex. I 
would expect an English class to provide teen-agers with examples of higher 
thinking and word usage in their literary pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Last time I checked, it was the responsibility of parents to "teach life's 
lessons" according to their principles and beliefs. I do wish the schools would 
stick with teaching academics instead of trying to infringe on the domain of 
the family.

THE MEAN STREETS MADE EVEN MEANER BY WRITER

 I wish to comment on a column by Robin Abcarian about jogging and telling off 
a motorist ("You Can't Curb the Animal Within," May 5).

 It is disheartening to read that instead of trying to elevate people's 
attitude, a writer would cater to the prevailing rudeness and vulgarity one 
hears everywhere.

 Robin Abcarian's foul-mouthed, transparently disguised, vulgarity-spewing loss 
of temper is surely not appropriate fare for the Sunday edition of a family 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, her glorified indulgence in lack of civility undermines her 
hand-wringing lamentations over the violence in our streets and around her 
Venice neighborhood.

 Thank you, Robin Abcarian, for validation in print that I am not the only 
occasional closet lunatic walking these mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how many times I, too, have spewed forth verbs and adjectives 
depicting acts and legacies of which I really have no personal knowledge.

DISTURBING MESSAGES DELIVERED FROM PULPIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for the fine article by Richard Natale about gay couples ("The New 
Protocol," June 6). 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I have attended an evangelical church and noticed a disturbing 
pattern over many years.In the late '30s, we would occasionally hear inferences 
from the pulpit that Jews killed Jesus Christ. After the horrors of WW II, 
these comments abated, but they were gradually replaced with sermons about 
godless hordes in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that communism has run out of gas, we are steadily hearing more and more 
abuse from the pulpit against gays. I am now revolted by my church and realize 
it has become a mouthpiece of the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 Do churches really need hot-button issues, such as hatred of Jews, hatred of 
Russians and hatred of gays to coalesce their congregations? We thought 
Christian churches were supposed to promote the teachings of Jesus -- love, 
forgiveness, compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not just our church. We read about a minister in Texas who mobilized 
his flock to initiate the reversal of a gay civil rights ordinance. Another 
minister interviewed on TV news preaches from his pulpit that gay people should 
be executed. These messages are so disturbing that we have stopped attending 
church.

STAGE WATCH: LOS ANGELES THEATRE CENTER STAGING A COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there life on Spring Street? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Theatre Center, the city-owned downtown theater complex, has 
seldom lived up to its name since its resident company collapsed in 1991. But 
last week came word that the L.A. premiere of a Stephen Sondheim musical, 
"Assassins," will be presented at LATC beginning Nov. 22. It will be just one 
of four shows the Los Angeles Repertory Co. plans to stage at LATC over the 
coming season. Also on tap are Brendan Behan's "The Hostage" and "Hamlet" in 
repertory, plus the West Coast premiere of Martin Sherman's "Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
 The series will be the first subscription season to be staged in the building 
since the old company fell apart. True, it will take place in the 90-seat 
Theatre 4 instead of the building's three larger halls. However, one of the 
bigger theaters -- the downstairs Theatre 3 -- has been busy lately, with the 
Bilingual Foundation's "Pancho Villa and the Naked Lady" and a double bill of 
the Andy Garcia-directed "Race2Love" and Rick Simone's "These People." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the San Francisco Mime Troupe will return to the largest theater, the 
Tom Bradley, for four performances of its latest show, "Escape From Cyberia", 
which deals with California issues, Aug. 11-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Friday, the larger halls may attract even more producers, for the 
rental rates are going down. Nonprofit groups will be able to rent the 498-seat 
Bradley for $500 a performance (down from $650). Rates for Theatres 2 and 3 are 
dropping by $100 to $350 for Theatre 2 and $400 for Theatre 3. The higher 
commercial rates will not change. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the small Theatre 4 and the even smaller Studio 5C will the rates go 
up Friday, from $100 to $175 in 4, from $40 to $60 in 5C. Because producers can 
use Actors' Equity's 99-Seat Theatre Plan (requiring only token payments to 
actors) in Theatre 4, it has been the busiest of the halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the city's Cultural Affairs Department, which runs the building, 
sound bullish on LATC's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 LATC "has happily become a non-issue on the political level," said Cultural 
Affairs General Manager Adolfo V. Nodal. The old LATC ignited bitter debates in 
the City Council and elsewhere over the public money spent on it. But now "it's 
no longer the lightning rod of our budget, and that's a great step forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is financing the building's overhead and utilities with $400,000 in 
the past fiscal year and with the same amount in the coming one. Rod Punt, the 
Cultural Affairs assistant manager who manages LATC, said that this "stable 
budget" has banished the former image of the place as "an unpredictable black 
hole of public funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural Affairs is moving its performing arts staff into offices within LATC, 
which should bring additional attention and possibly extra expenditures from 
the performing arts budget into the building. LATC also received its first 
outside grant since 1991 when the Norris Foundation gave $10,000 to help 
improve the computer system in the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city took over the management of the building, a co-op of groups that 
would get first call on the facility -- and lower rental rates -- was 
announced. That co-op is now dead, for all practical purposes. While two 
members of the co-op, the Bilingual Foundation and Will & Co., have used LATC 
regularly, most of the other members have not. Most of them "have their own 
home facilities or communities," Punt said, and "LATC represented another 
dimension or an outreach for them" -- one they couldn't afford during 
recessionary times. The co-op's special rates are no longer in effect; all 
nonprofits share the same rates. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret that many theatergoers still perceive the LATC area as 
dangerous. But Nodal and Punt want that image dispelled. The street is better 
lit, security guards are in place, and the alley behind the building is blocked 
off so that people may now park in the rear and enter through the back of the 
building without venturing onto Spring Street. That alley is "is so clean you 
could eat an egg off it," claimed Punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is bending over backwards to make it easy" to produce at LATC, said 
Peter Ellenstein, L.A. Rep's managing director. And he believes Sondheim fans 
will go see "Assassins" wherever it's produced, even if they're leery of the 
area around LATC. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SUN SETS: Glenn Close and Alan Campbell leave "Sunset Boulevard" after 
tonight's performance. But before leaving, they got an opportunity to hear 
themselves on the new cast album. Producer/composer Andrew Lloyd Webber hosted 
a "listening party" party for the cast at the Record Plant in Hollywood 
Tuesday. A fall release is planned for the album. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the "Sunset" cast's question-and-answer session that was to have 
been held Wednesday afternoon at the Shubert Theatre was canceled in order to 
accommodate a New York Times photo session on the set, said a spokesman. People 
who had reserved tickets through Telecharge were called about the cancellation, 
but some 35 were turned away at the door. The event, which would have benefited 
several AIDS-relief projects, will probably be rescheduled "with another 
Norma,' presumably Faye Dunaway, the spokesman said. The cast had already 
raised $100,000 in fund-raising efforts for various charities in earlier 
benefits, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 SCHENNKAN EXITS L.A.: Robert Schenkkan, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer of "The 
Kentucky Cycle," is no longer Los Angeles-based. Formerly a denizen of Van 
Nuys, Schenkkan and his family have moved to Seattle, primarily because they 
believe it's a better place to raise their two children, said the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. was very good to my career," Schenkkan noted. But Seattle has been no 
slouch in that department. The city's Intiman Theatre presented the world 
premiere of "The Kentucky Cycle" and is now headed by "Cycle" director Warner 
Shook, who has commissioned Schenkkan's next play, "Handler." About the new 
play, Schenkkan would say only that it's less than two hours long, all in one 
part, and requires a cast of seven -- in contrast to the massive, two-part 
"Cycle." He said there's a chance that it may pass through a future Mark Taper 
Forum New Work Festival -- as did the "Cycle" before it went to the Intiman and 
then to the Taper mainstage.*

ON THE RECORD: 2 INTRIGUING VERSIONS OF 'DER FLIEGENDE HOLLANDER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Der Fliegende Hollander" is the Wagner opera you're likely to love if you 
don't love Wagner. Relatively kind to the Sitzfleisch , too, at about 2 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Der Fliegende Hollander" is an early work, predating "Der Ring des 
Nibelungen" and "Tristan und Isolde" and partaking of a different artistic 
aesthetic. It's a largely outdoor-romantic piece, set in a world of nature -- 
and folksy super-nature (as in supernatural) -- looking back to Weber's 
"Freischutz," but with hints of the complex harmonic language that would become 
part and parcel of the ultimately heavy Wagnerian baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatically, Wagner's own libretto is simpler than anything one finds in his 
later works: a straightforward fable about redemption through love, or so it 
seems at first. As it turns out, there's nothing straightforward about the 
obsessed-with-salvation Dutchman, or about the obsessed-with-the-Dutchman 
Senta. But compared to later Wagner, this one's for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 For its new recording of the opera, London has assembled some of the bigger 
names among current Wagnerians under an authoritative conductor, Christoph von 
Dohnanyi, at the head of the mighty Vienna Philharmonic and excellent Vienna 
State Opera Chorus (London 436 418, 2 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 Dohnanyi's leadership is admirably fluid and balancing from the outset, 
supportive rather than indulgent of his singers. As the drama becomes more 
taut, the conductor achieves a fiery intensity that conveys the action 
masterfully. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutchman is Robert Hale, who after a solid, decades-long but unremarkable 
career has become a major Heldenbariton -- arguably, along with James Morris, 
one of the best Wotans around. 
</P>
<P>
 He sings here with utmost simplicity, which might be interpreted as a 
not-too-strong sense of character (the right sounds and right moves, but 
lacking no suggestion of dementia that is built into the character). His effort 
is, for the most part, strong and fluent, but the microphones cannot hide the 
incipient beat in high, fortissimo passages. 
</P>
<P>
 His companions are Kurt Rydl, a faceless, wobbly Daland; Josef Protschka, an 
appealing if at times vocally hard-pressed Erik and Uwe Heilmann's sweetly 
elegant Steersman. 
</P>
<P>
 The problematic, to put it kindly, Senta is Hildegard Behrens: reasonably 
secure of voice on first encounter, but all too soon crossing over into 
hysteria, her voice in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compare London's product, reflective of 1990s vocal reality, with a 
"Hollander" reissue on the Berlin Classics label (2097, 2 CDs) of a 1962 
recording once available here on Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Franz Konwitschny, East Germany's -- and Leipzig's -- chief conductor 
prior to Kurt Masur, leads the Berlin Staatskappelle and Chorus of the Deutsche 
Oper in a performance that, from the first churnings of the overture to the 
soothing, redemptive chords of the final curtain, has shape, wit and high 
drama, to say nothing of the singers to project the conductor's vision. 
</P>
<P>
 His Dutchman is Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau: poetic, haunted, sensitive and in 
superb voice (he never sang the role onstage), with not a trace of the 
hectoring that could mark (and mar) much of his work elsewhere. He and the 
Daland of the wonderfully black-toned Gottlob Frick -- voice like a rock -- are 
a show-stopping pair in their rollicking exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolf Schock is an ardent, likable Erik and the unforgettable Fritz 
Wunderlich exemplifies luxury casting as the Steersman. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Schech is not the most distinctive or seductive Senta imaginable, 
certainly no match for Leonie Rysanek on the roughly contemporaneous London 
recording (417 319, 2 CDs), with George London's grimly powerful Dutchman. But 
Schech's bright soprano has more thrust and solidity than one remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, this "Fliegende Hollander" is an altogether distinguished effort. 
One looks forward eagerly to Berlin Classics' restoration of comparable 
recorded treasures from the recent past.

RECORD RACK: PAIN SHOWS GAIN WITH 'SAME' QUIRKINESS; (***) HOUSE OF PAIN, "SAME 
AS IT EVER WAS"; TOMMY BOY  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike most white rap artists, the Irish-American rap trio House of Pain 
doesn't really try to copy black rap. Instead, the group uses it as a 
jumping-off point for offbeat explorations of funk, rock and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Pain's second album is a little more imaginative than its debut, 
boasting more clever lyrics and daring beats -- mostly a sort of fuzzy, 
psychedelic funk, with squeaky, jazzy horn lines wiggling through, the kind of 
tension-filled grooves that aim to keep you unsettled. As on the debut, Cypress 
Hill's Muggs co-produced with HOP's DJ Real, and "Same as It Ever Was" has a 
Cypress Hill feel -- that same low-key lunacy and reality distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 This album really isn't about anything in particular. It's like sparkling 
street-corner chatter, alternately ominous and funny. The three even put their 
macho swagger on hold long enough for a surprisingly tender ode to friendship 
called "Still Got a Lotta Love," with only a melancholy jazz bass line as 
background. The rapping of Everlast and Danny Boy has a natural, almost ragged 
quality -- textures befitting these quirky tales. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

RECORD RACK: (**) KEITH SWEAT, "GET UP ON IT"; ELEKTRA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just call this mood music for the love gangstas and roughnecks, two core 
groups that Sweat affectionately gives a shout-out to on his latest album. 
Having cranked out several sex-obsessed singles since the mid-'80s, the New 
Yorker still keeps his narrow focus on the body's reproductive regions.That 
isn't necessarily bad news to those who've followed his career since "I Want 
Her," his sweat-drenched ode to lust at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
 While his biggest hits in recent years have been those he co-wrote for the 
group Silk, Sweat puts his characteristic nasal whine to effective use on "How 
Do You Like It," featuring TLC's Lisa Lopes. This brand of New Jack Swing 
doesn't actually sound that new anymore, but Sweat gets it to swing after a 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 As a new artist, Sweat arguably did his best work under the direction of 
producer Teddy Riley. There seemed to be more heart then in the midst of all 
that funk-driven, hormonal hip-hop. Sweat may still be rough and ready, but 
aside from one or two strong tracks, this album is stymied by too many dry 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 ** 1/2 Tony Bennett, "MTV Unplugged," Columbia. There are six more songs here 
than in the hourlong telecast, but none feature J Mascis and Evan Dando, the 
young rock guests who might have stirred this up into something more than a 
cruise-control performance.It's a typically masterful, buoyant set of pop 
standards, but there's not a trace of adventure or surprise.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: IMPRESSIVE NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teen-aged R&B singer Aaliyah is a protege of R. Kelly, who's noted for his 
racy material . Though he wrote, produced and raps on her single, "Back and 
Forth," it's not that racy--but it's a big hit: No. 4 on The Times' Southern 
California pop singles chart. Her first album, "Age Ain't Nothing But a 
Number," is doing well too: No. 17 on the pop chart. Unlike some rap artists 
who make splashy chart debuts and then fade, Warren G. is apparently no 
flash-in-the-pan. His "Regulate" album still tops the pop, rap and R&B charts.

 *** OutKast, "SOUTHERNPLAYALISTICADDILLACMUZIK," LaFace. This rap duo's debut 
album serves up hip-hop Southern style, with laid-back grooves flavored with 
'70s funk.Their sauntering, hard-core tales of the 'hood bristle with clever 
humor and sharp insights rather than rage. The best cut is the sobering "Git 
Up, Git Out," whose blunt message is: Put down that joint and do something 
productive.

 *** Glenn Jones, "Here I Am," Atlantic. Long recognized as a gospel wailer, 
Jones also treads the more worldly R&B path with equally stirring results.His 
unabashedly sensual title cut is the best soul ballad he's ever recorded, while 
on the surprisingly savvy "Round and Round" Jones jams quite convincingly. Not 
surprisingly, he infuses every track with gospel-edged fervor.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 *** Aphex Twin, "Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2," Sire/Warp. You can't really 
dance or even tap your foot to the minimal purr created by Richard James, 
a.k.a. Aphex Twin, who has modified the sound he originally honed in London's 
underground rave parties.There's no real focal point on this two-disc set, but 
instead an all-surrounding sea of synthesized moods.

 MAC ATTACK II: Koppelman may want to consult with Paramount Pictures before 
finalizing the McDonald's promotions. Last year the film and TV production 
company offered four home videos (including Oscar-winner "Dances With Wolves") 
at a big discount with a purchase through McDonald's before they were available 
through conventional stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower's Goman says that as a result of video store owners' complaints, 
Paramount then also offered discounts to the retailers so that they could run 
their own promotions to help make up for business lost to McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 But some video store owners reportedly took more direct action by sending 
their employees out to McDonald's to get the videos, which they then resold for 
a profit -- though still less than their usual price. 
</P>
<P>
 Goman says he had no plans to try that with the music deal. "I'm not going to 
send my employees out and make them eat hamburgers," he says. Steve Hochman

 BECK'S BACK: Boston took eight years between its last album and its new one. 
Beck didn't even take eight months. The L.A. hip-hop-folkster best known for 
his song "Loser" has just released "One Foot in the Grave," the follow-up to 
his Geffen debut album, "Mellow Gold," which came out in February. 
</P>
<P>
 This one's not on Geffen, though. It's on the tiny, Olympia, Wash.-based K 
Records. (Geffen didn't drop Beck; his contract with the company allows him to 
release independent music through small labels.) 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to expect the new album, with its oddball folk-blues ditties and 
ranting punk songs, to approach the 600,000 sales figure reached so far by 
"Mellow Gold." But it's certain to eclipse K's previous top seller, a 1993 
album by the group Tiger Trap that has sold about 10,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Can K handle the bigger scale? 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be doing all right," says the label's laconic owner Calvin Johnson 
(whose own band, the Halo Benders, also has a new record out on K). "For us, 
it's not really any different than the other records we put out in terms of why 
we put it out or who he is. He's a guy who makes up songs and has a way he 
wants them to be, so that's how we treat it." Steve Hochman

 If you went out and spent a bundle on computer equipment so you could check in 
on Courtney Love through the America Online service, we're sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 Following last week's Pop Eye coverage of Love's use of the service to 
communicate with fans and air her grievances after the suicide of her husband, 
Kurt Cobain, in April, she has signed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "i wont be bak," the singer wrote in a final message posted on one of the AOL 
bulletin boards. "i thought it was good to come here and flame my real father 
and stop slim (Slim Moon, owner of the record label Kill Rock Stars) from 
ripping off Kurt, but all the publicity . . . forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 To fans who had sent her messages of support she added, "you all seem really 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
 As for your friendly Pop Eye correspondent, Love wasn't so kind, using the 
term weasel . We don't take it too hard; some have suggested that being called 
a weasel by Love is the grunge equivalent of being on Nixon's enemies list. 
</P>
<P>
 We should note that in her message Love wrote, "pls DONT PUBLISH THIS POSTING" 
-- an odd request to put on something posted in a public forum already accessed 
by thousands of people. Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: Baby, you can drive Ringo's car. The former Beatles 
drummer's '57 Chevy is the centerpiece item of a rock memorabilia auction being 
conducted by a firm called It's Only Rock 'n' Roll of Huntington Station, N.Y. 
The company expects the vehicle -- said to be in mint condition -- to fetch 
more than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The unique thing about this auction, though, is you don't have to be there to 
check out the merchandise. The company is billing it as the "first ever video 
rock 'n' roll auction" -- all the items can be "previewed" on a videotape made 
by the firm, and bids will be taken by mail, phone and fax, with items being 
sold Tuesday and Wednesday evening.

 Morrissey and Siouxsie Sioux have recorded a duet titled "Interlude," which 
will be released as a single next month. A new Morrissey single, "Now My Heart 
Is Full," will also be released at the same time on a CD, with several bonus 
tracks -- possibly including the singer's version of the late Henry Mancini's 
"Moon River" -- currently available only in England. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are starting to firm up for R.E.M.'s first tour since 1989. As it 
stands, Michael Stipe and his bandmates -- with a new album due in the fall -- 
will hit the road in Europe in early '95, with North American dates to follow. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone keeps expecting Bruce Springsteen to jam at the House of Blues with 
the Monday house band led by his former E Street Band keyboardist Danny 
Federici. Instead, he's showing up everywhere but there. Last weekend he sat in 
with John Wesley Harding at McCabe's (they did the Boss' "Wreck on the 
Highway"). The two had met when Springsteen jammed with the Rock Bottom 
Remainders (the band of authors that includes Stephen King and Dave Barry) at a 
recent L.A. show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithereens and the Wailing Souls will headline a July 21 benefit at the 
Palace for the family of the groups' assistant manager John Schillaci, who died 
in an April car wreck in L.A. Comedian-actor Bobcat Goldthwait will emcee the 
event and other performers will be announced later. . . . The Smithereens have 
also just recorded a version of the Outsiders' '60s garage-rock hit "Time Won't 
Let Me" for the movie "Time Cops." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And Peter Cox (formerly of Go West) and Nicky Harris have recorded "We Can 
Find a Way" as the end title song for "Corrina, Corrina." The soundtrack for 
the film, which stars Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta, will also feature vintage 
recordings by the likes of Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Showtime's upcoming "Rebel Highway," a series of '50s movies remade by today's 
directors, will feature a soundtrack of '50s songs remade by today's artists. 
An album from the series, "Fast Track to Nowhere" (due from A&M on Aug. 19), 
will include Iggy Pop doing Eddie Cochran's "C'mon Everybody," a Babes in 
Toyland version of Little Richard's "The Girl Can't Help It," and contributions 
from Los Lobos, Concrete Blonde and Sheryl Crow, among others. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The debut album from the band Bloodline -- which teams teen guitar whiz Joe 
Bonamasso with Berry Oakley Jr. (son of the late Allman Brothers bassist), Erin 
Davis (son of the late jazz great Miles Davis) and Waylon Krieger (son of 
ex-Doors guitarist Robby Krieger) -- is due Aug. 23. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Thorogood and Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson are among those contributing 
tracks to an album of songs written by guitarist Peter Green, the troubled 
founder of Fleetwood Mac who left the band in the early '70s. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Carleen Anderson, the goddaughter of the Godfather of Soul (James Brown, of 
course) has a solo album, "True Spirit," due from Virgin on Sept. 6. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We goofed when we referred to Power Station members John and Andy Taylor as 
"ex-members" of Duran Duran. John is still the double-D bassist. OK, Durannies, 
you can stop calling now.

RESTAURANT NEWS: IF YOU WANT PIZZA, YOU'VE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE 
</P>

 "There are three words that I don't want to hear in my restaurant," insists 
Ramon Papa: " bistro , cafe and pizza. " 
</P>
<P>
 Papa and his partner Doug Flohr are planning to open a restaurant in the space 
that was once Tra Fiori and, before that, Cafe Jacoulet. They haven't come up 
with a name yet, but they've already hired a chef: Sean Sheridan, formerly of 
Bistro 45 in Pasadena. His Mediterranean/Asian menu will feature entrees in the 
$15 range. After a few cosmetic changes to the Pasadena site, Papa, who 
currently manages the dining room at the Ritz Carlton, Pasadena, and Flohr, who 
manages Pinot Bistro in Studio City, are aiming for a mid-September opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Bistro 45 owner Robert Simon also had an eye on the space. He 
and his father used to own Cafe Jacoulet and he wanted to open a deli there. 
"The last bid was between Robert and me," says Papa, "and I won." 
</P>
<P>
 "The price got to the point where it didn't make any sense," says Simon, who 
still wants to open a New York-style deli someday. "That was a good place at 
what could have been the right price, but even that location isn't that great 
-- it's two blocks off Colorado Boulevard. But I think a deli is great concept 
for Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 LIGHT AT END OF TUNNEL: Atlas has no plans to close, says general manager 
Stephen Noriega. Since the death of creator Mario Tamayo in May from AIDS, 
customers have been calling the kitschy Wilshire Boulevard restaurant to 
inquire if it's still open. "Everything is staying the same," Noriega insists. 
"Before his death, Mario asked me to continue to run Atlas the way he 
envisioned it, with all the craziness it's always had. He used to tell people 
he's was grooming me for his departure."  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the three-year-long Metro Rail construction project is completed, the 
restaurant has valet parking again. (The corner in front is a major Metro Rail 
stop.) Also new: on Thursday evenings former "Rifleman" co-star Johnny Crawford 
sings songs from the '20s and '30s and Tuesday will soon become tango night. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this Johnny Crawford thing, we are getting a whole range of customers 
now, from the very young to people in their 60s," says Noriega. "It hasn't 
diminished too much from that real eclectic crowd, though. You still get your 
drag queens coming in here." 
</P>
<P>
 WAITING SINCE COOLIDGE: Is Rita Coolidge psychic? Scene: The House of Blues on 
Sunset Boulevard. The pop singer is standing out front, waiting to retrieve her 
car from the valet parking when one of the valets barrels up in a Porsche -- 
not hers -- and parks it on an incline. Coolidge turns to the large group of 
music fans who have also been waiting patiently and predicts: "This guy is 
going to get out of the car, he's not going to put the brakes on, and it's 
going to roll back down the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right," confirms her manager, Tim Goodwin. "The car came up, the guy 
got out and the car went right back down the hill with the valet chasing after 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 OPENINGS: Capoccione Itameshi-Ya ("Capo-chee-oh-nee Ee-tah-may-she-ya," as it 
is explained in a recent press release), sister restaurant to the 
Japanese-Italian hybrid Itameshi-Ya on Melrose Avenue, is slated to open next 
month on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. . . . Rodolfo Mendoza is 
offering Mexican cuisine at Tucan Restaurant on Venice Boulevard in Culver 
City, just down the street from his brother Jose's restaurant, Bamboo. . . . 
Next month, Santa Barbara restaurateur Steven Sponder will open Palace EXPRESS, 
a quick-service version of his 9-year-old Palace Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSING: Two years ago, immigration lawyer and community activist Antonio 
Rodriguez announced that he was opening a Mexican food stall in downtown's 
Grand Central Market. He also boasted that his place would feature the sauces 
his family made famous at La Serenata de Garibaldi in Boyle Heights. This made 
his brother Jose Rodriguez furious. "That place has nothing to do with my 
restaurant," the chef/owner told Calendar at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio went ahead and opened the fast-food outlet anyway, causing a rift in 
the family over the ownership of the complex sauce recipes. A moot point now, 
since word comes that Antonio has quietly closed El Canto de Isabel. According 
to Grand Central spokeswoman, the space will become a Kentucky Fried Chicken 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR THE RECORD: It was reported in Restaurant News (April 24) and in First 
Impressions (June 12) that Prince was an investor in West Hollywood's 
Trocadero. According to Karen Lee, vice president of media and communications 
for Prince's Paisley Park Productions, "The artist formerly known as Prince is 
not an investor in the new Trocadero restaurant."

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / STEWART ALSOP: THE FUTURE OF SOUTH AFRICA LOOKS 
HOPEFUL -- AND MAYBE DIGITAL

<P>
 If you were Nelson Mandela, what would you think about technology's role in 
society? 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty interesting question -- one that I had an opportunity to think about a 
lot earlier this month, when I made a speech on future technology in 
Johannesburg before an audience of business and technology managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Toffler, the author of "Future Shock," "Powershift" and, most recently, 
"War And Anti-War," was the keynote speaker. His primary thesis is that the 
arrival of digital technology is causing a fundamental shift in society that is 
just as significant as the shift caused by organized agriculture earlier in 
this millennium and by the Industrial Revolution at the end of the last 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Toffler refers to this shift as the "Third Wave," and he argues that it will 
change and is changing all of the central assumptions we have about our society 
-- about economics, politics, social interaction, education, everything. We 
need to understand these changes, according to Toffler, to maintain social 
order and make the transition successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 I identified what I consider the four key technologies to watch for the rest 
of the '90s: networking, digital devices, wireless communications and work 
group software. While I was talking, I kept thinking that what I really was 
describing were the very products and technologies that are enabling the Third 
Wave to sweep our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that Toffler and I were speaking in South Africa. This is a country 
where, until recently, most of the major corporations in the world refused to 
even try to make a profit. Other African countries refused to allow South 
Africa's commercial airplanes to fly through their airspace. Walls topped with 
barbed wire surround many of the houses of the rich and middle class. Iron 
gates and buzzer systems frequently restrict entry to restaurants and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa is a rich and diverse country. The bush. Gold mining. Cape Town. 
But it's a country that's been brutally managed on behalf of a very small 
minority for the past 40 years. And that has screwed up its entire 
infrastructure. Forty percent of the country's able-bodied population is 
unemployed. More than 70% of its adult population is illiterate or 
semiliterate. In a country of 40 million people, there are only 3 million 
telephones -- old ones at that, as I can attest from personal experience -- and 
2.5 million televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But South Africa now has something golden: hope. And that hope is centered on 
Nelson Mandela and his new government. So I come back to the original question: 
If you were Mandela, what would you think about technology in society? 
</P>
<P>
 You and I know that technology could help South Africans make the leap from 
where they are now -- somewhere between the First and Second Wave -- solidly 
into the Third Wave and a leadership position in Africa and possibly the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology, for example, could help South Africa build a communications 
infrastructure where none has existed. On June 1, the country switched on its 
cellular phone system for the first time. The government did a good job: It 
designed a competitive system based on the same standard as European mobile 
phones, meaning the network was able to be built very quickly and the cost of 
the phones will fall very rapidly. Because it is competitive, the cost of 
making calls is substantially lower for the cellular system than for the 
monopoly wired system, which is managed by a state bureaucracy called Telkom. 
</P>
<P>
 But . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But the people who are living in and running South Africa have little 
experience with technology or its potential benefits, and Mandela's new 
government is only beginning to develop its policies and philosophy in this 
area. It's hard enough for those of us in advanced, industrialized countries 
like the United States to figure out how to use it. But imagine trying to 
justify the cost of a digital highway system when you live in a country that 
hasn't yet built an extensive concrete highway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the inequities of the past, it appears South Africans want a 
managed economy that ensures that the wealth and resources of the country are 
redistributed to the population that has been disenfranchised by the old 
system.  
</P>
<P>
 But time has demonstrated -- in the differences between how technology has 
been developed and used by the United States compared to Europe or Japan -- 
that a managed system is anathema to the rapid spread of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa could become the social and economic beacon for the rest of the 
African continent. But it needs to take some drastic steps -- deregulating its 
telephone business, defining clear rules for competition, providing incentives 
to invest in technology and education -- to become that beacon and surf the 
Third Wave.  
</P>
<P>
 I left hoping that Nelson Mandela does see the value of technology in 
enfranchising the entire population.

 You won't ever know the worst that happened to Nicole Brown Simpson in her 
marriage, because she is dead and cannot tell you. And if she were alive, 
remember, you wouldn't believe her. 
</P>
<P>
 You heard Lorena Bobbitt, after John Wayne Bobbitt had been acquitted of 
marital rape. At her own trial for malicious wounding, she described beatings, 
anal rape, humiliation. She had been persistently injured, hit, choked, by a 
husband who liked hurting her. John Wayne Bobbitt, after a brief tour as a 
misogynist-media star, beat up a new woman friend. 
</P>
<P>
 It is always the same. It happens to women as different as Nicole Simpson, 
Lorena Bobbitt -- and me. The perpetrators are men as different as O.J. 
Simpson, John Wayne Bobbitt and the former flower-child I am still too afraid 
to name. 
</P>
<P>
 There is terror, yes, and physical pain. There is desperation and despair. One 
blames oneself, forgives him. One judges oneself harshly for not loving him 
enough. "It's your fault," he shouts as he is battering in the door, or 
slamming your head against the floor. And before you pass out, you say yes. You 
run, but no one will hide you or stand up for you -- which means standing up to 
him. You will hide behind bushes if there are bushes; or behind trash cans; or 
in alleys; away from the decent people who aren't helping you. It is, after 
all, your fault. 
</P>
<P>
 He hurts you more: More than last time and more than you ever thought 
possible; certainly more than any reasonable person would ever believe -- 
should you be foolish enough to tell. And, eventually, you surrender to him, 
apologize, beg him to forgive you for hurting him or provoking him or insulting 
him or being careless with something of his -- his laundry, his car, his meal. 
You ask him not to hurt you as he does what he wants to you. 
</P>
<P>
 The shame of this physical capitulation, often sexual, and the betrayal of 
your self-respect will never leave you. You will blame yourself and hate 
yourself forever. In your mind, you will remember yourself -- begging, abject. 
At some point, you will stand up to him verbally, or by not complying, and he 
will hit you and kick you; he may rape you; he may lock you up or tie you up. 
The violence becomes contextual, the element in which you try to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 You will try to run away, plan an escape. If he finds out, or if he finds you, 
he will hurt you more. You will be so frightened you think dying might be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have no money, can't find shelter, have no work, you will go back and 
ask him to let you in. If you work, he will find you. He may ask you back and 
make promises filled with repentance. He may beat you and force you back. But 
if you do stay away and make a break, he will strike out of nowhere, still beat 
you, vandalize your home, stalk you. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one stops him. You aren't his wife anymore, and he still gets to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson, like every battered woman, knew she would not be believed. She 
may have been shrewd enough to anticipate the crowds along the Orange County 
freeways cheering on O.J. Every battered woman has to be careful, even with 
strangers. His friends won't stop him. Neither will yours.  
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson went to many experts on domestic violence for help but none of 
them stopped him. That's what it takes: The batterer has to be stopped. He will 
not stop himself. He has to be imprisoned, or killed, or she has to escape and 
hide, sometimes for the rest of her life, sometimes until he finds another 
woman to "love." There is no proof that counseling the batterer stops him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Nicole who asked the police to arrest Simpson in 1989, the ninth time 
the police had been called. Arrest needs to be mandatory. The 1989 assault on 
Nicole Simpson should have resulted in O.J. Simpson's ninth arrest. We don't 
know by what factor to multiply the number nine: How many episodes of being 
beaten women endure, on average, per phone call to the police. In 1993 alone, 
there were 300,000 domestic violence calls to the police in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Wife-beating is not America's dirty little secret, as the press and Health and 
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala say. Feminists have spent two decades 
exposing wife-abuse with insistence and accuracy, organizing refuges and escape 
routes and changing law-enforcement practices so that, increasingly, 
wife-beating is recognized as a violent crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Wife-beating is commonplace and ordinary because men believe they have rights 
over women that women dispute. The control men want of women, the domination 
men require over women, is expressed in this terrible brutality. For me, it was 
for a four-year period, 25 years ago in another country. For 4 million women in 
the United States, one every 15 seconds, it was yesterday and today. 
</P>
<P>
 What no one will face is this: The problem is not with the woman; it is with 
the perpetrator. She can change every weakness, transform every dependency. She 
can escape with the bravado of a Jesse James or the subtle skill of a Houdini. 
But if the husband is committed to violence and she is not, she cannot win her 
safety or her freedom. The current legal system, victim advocates, counseling, 
cannot keep her safe in the face of his aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of wife-beating have typically been met with incredulity and disdain, 
best expressed in the persistent question, "Why doesn't she leave? " But after 
two decades of learning about battery, we now know that more battered women are 
killed after they leave than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson was living in her own home when she was murdered. Her divorce 
had been finalized in 1992. Whether or not her ex-husband committed the murder, 
he did continue to assault her, threaten her, stalk her, intimidate her. His 
so-called desire for reconciliation masks the awfulness of her situation, the 
same for every woman who escapes but does not disappear. Having ended the 
marriage, Nicole Simpson still had to negotiate her safety with the man who was 
hurting her. 
</P>
<P>
 She had to avoid angering him. Any hint that her amiability was essentially 
coerced, any threat of public exposure, any insult to his dignity from his 
point of view, might trigger aggression. This cause-and-effect scenario is more 
imagined than real, since the perpetrator chooses when he will hurt or threaten 
or stalk. Still, the woman tries. All the smiling photographs of them together 
after the divorce should evoke alarm, not romantic descriptions of his desire 
to reconcile. Nicole Simpson followed a strategy of appeasement, because no one 
stood between her and him to stop him.  
</P>
<P>
 Escape, in fact, is hell, a period of indeterminate length reckoned in years, 
not months, when the ex-husband commits assaults intermittently and acts of 
terrorism with some consistency. Part of the torment is that freedom is near 
but he will not let the woman have it. Many escaped women live half in hiding. 
I am still afraid of my ex-husband each and every day of my life -- and I am 
not afraid of much. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you don't know how brave women are -- the ones who have stayed until now 
and the ones who have escaped, both the living and the dead. Nicole Simpson is 
the hero. The perpetrator is the problem, stupid.

AT THE STRETCH ON HEALTH CARE -- BUT WHAT'S THE PLAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregg Easterbrook, Gregg Easterbrook is a contributing editor to Newsweek 
and the Atlantic Monthly. His book on the historical significance of

<P>
 And now the really big question about health-care reform: Will the final 
legislation include Rita's phone number? 
</P>
<P>
 As a congressional vote on health- care reform draws near, it is impor tant to 
keep Rita's phone number in mind. In 1981, when the tax-cut plan proposed by 
Ronald Reagan was approaching its floor vote, the provisions of the bill were 
changing so frantically that members of Congress never saw a printed version of 
the bill before the final vote. Instead, they voted yea or nay on a sheaf of 
handwritten pages scrawled down by White House lobbyists. One page included the 
notation "CALL RITA," with a phone number. This historic message was then 
dutifully transcribed into the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. After all, it 
had been formally approved by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out the legislators who voted on the 1981 tax-cut bill not only did 
not know that it contained Rita's number, they barely understood any of the 
provisions: Chief among them that the law would create the mega-deficits that 
have plagued the federal government since. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the gathering dynamic on health-care reform. Hardly anyone can keep 
the provisions of the various "managed competition" proposals straight anymore. 
There exists considerable danger that when the House and Senate act to 
restructure the $900-billion health-care industry that, at about 14.5% of the 
gross national product, is larger than the auto and petroleum industries 
combined, many members of Congress will have only the faintest notion of what 
is in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, there's the Clinton plan, the Cooper plan, the Cooper-Breaux 
version of the Cooper plan, the Kennedy plan, the Moynihan plan, the Chafee 
plan and the Dole plan -- to cite only the major proposals. These plans call 
for some version of voluntary mandated subsidized market-oriented standardized 
individual trigger-financed seasonally rotated regional alliances (with 
subsection D attainment zone waivers) for universal coverage (except for those 
not covered) beginning in the 1998-23rd Century time frame. The cost will be 
precisely approximately $25.95 to $500 billion, though we haven't yet figured 
out if that is annually, or per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the provisions of the plans dimly understood: They are now 
changing so fast even policy wonks have difficulty remembering what stipulation 
is in which bill. After all those months of Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
black-cloaked health-care monks coming to nuanced positions covering minute 
details, now in the rush to enact something, matters as fundamental as whether 
employers will be required to pay for health coverage, or only asked to pay, 
are being revised on an almost daily basis. New cost estimates are essentially 
being pulled out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 To a certain extent, this is a predictable result of Clinton's proposing a 
bill that, at 1,364 pages, was so complicated there was never a chance people 
would be able to keep its provisions straight. Then, when the first 
congressional opposition arose, White House officials began saying that 
everything was negotiable except for universal coverage. This meant open 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost every major chairman of a relevant committee in the House and 
Senate has a reform bill -- most cobbled-together admixtures of buzzwords and 
loopholes. An example is the "trigger" provision every bill suddenly seems to 
contain. Rather than an immediate requirement that employers provide health 
insurance, "trigger" provisions specify that if all Americans do not acquire 
health coverage five or 10 years down the road, employer mandates would be 
imposed. The "trigger" approach is a classic example of the political gimmick 
of taking credit for action today but postponing the hard work into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone remember the Gramm-Rudman bill? Enacted in 1985, it declared with great 
fanfare that, henceforth, Congress would be compelled to balance the budget -- 
but postponed enactment of balanced budgets into future years. Gramm-Rudman 
allegedly had "trigger" provisions that future sessions of Congress would never 
be able to dodge. Every one was dodged. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care trigger provisions appear to have about as much actuality as 
Gramm-Rudman. Since there is zero chance that universal coverage will achieve 
itself spontaneously, either an employer-mandate trigger would be "hard," 
written in such a way as to be automatic, and thus would be a dishonest 
provision, shifting the accountability to a future Congress and White House; or 
the trigger would be "soft," a Gramm-Rudman-style provision written so it can 
be easily circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
 That prominent Democrats such as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York are 
now speaking kindly of triggers, and Clinton has said he will consider them, 
indicates that serious health-care reform is in the process of evaporating. In 
fact, at this point it's not even clear just what reform Clinton's bill would 
achieve, let alone what would be achieved by any of the many watered-down 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan, all major Democratic alternatives and the moderate Republican 
alternative backed by Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island ought to be 
rechristened "insurance-reform" bills. All would outlaw the practice of health 
insurers barring coverage for those with pre-existing illnesses; make it easy 
for people who change jobs to change plans; make it easy for the self-employed 
to buy health insurance; impose some version of "community rating" where 
premiums are about the same for all who subscribe to the same plan, and require 
standardized insurance packages so that consumers could make meaningful price 
comparisons when they shop polices. 
</P>
<P>
 All these are valid reforms whose enactment will benefit consumers. Most are 
even reforms the health-insurance industry knows are needed, but that will only 
work if realized through uniform national legislation that keeps competition 
among individual companies equal. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, it's not clear what, if any, health-care reform will be 
accomplished. Clinton has repeatedly -- and rightly -- said the fact that the 
United States is the sole industrial nation without universal health care is an 
outrage, and that he would veto any bill that does not create universal health 
care. But his is the sole "managed competition" bill facing this issue head-on. 
Edward M. Kennedy's plan waffles. The Cooper bill, authored by Rep. Jim Cooper 
(D-Tenn.), pointedly dodges universal coverage. Moynihan's makes hazy promises 
about revisiting the issue in a decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Further on the non-reform front, Clinton's mandatory regional health alliance 
requirement (whatever it means; no one has ever understood it) is teetering and 
may be withdrawn. Some of the plans now call instead for creation of 
health-purchasing cooperatives, but these sound hauntingly like existing HMOs 
and PPOs. 
</P>
<P>
 And the goal of containing health costs -- the goal that most frightened the 
entrenched hospital, pharmaceutical and physician interests -- has, to the 
pleasure of these groups, been forgotten in the ruckus. Cooper's plan contains 
some non-binding mumbo-jumbo about how it would be nice if market forces drove 
down costs. Clinton's plan is gradually being stripped of what meaningful 
cost-control measures it once had. The Kennedy, Moynihan, Chafee and other 
proposals barely mention cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 If what ultimately passes Congress is health-insurance reform plus some vague 
language about purchasing co-ops, the aftermath for Clinton will be strange. 
Genuine good would be done by such a bill, particularly for the self-employed 
and those in the Kafkaesque position of being unable to obtain health insurance 
because they need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-insurance reform is a long overdue objective that neither Ronald Reagan 
nor George Bush would have touched with a 10-meter pole. Had the goal going in 
been health-insurance reform, Clinton would deserve praise for reaching it. But 
Clinton set for himself the high moral goal of universal coverage, and now may 
not attain it. This will enable pundits and Clinton's opponents to portray the 
bill as a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters may end up thinking of the bill as a success for Clinton -- because the 
insurance-reform aspects will be a boon to the middle class, particularly 
anyone who changes jobs or falls ill. Today middle-class complaints about 
health care turn not on costs or quality but on the problems of obtaining or 
keeping coverage. These will likely be solved by whatever bill Congress enacts. 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that middle-class voters come to feel their health-care 
complaints have been resolved by Clinton's actions, they will care less about 
the system's two basic faults -- the shameful lack of coverage for 15% of 
Americans, and the health-cost spiral that consumes ever more national wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sole bill that does address both universal coverage and the 
need to control costs -- the national-health or "single payer" legislation 
sponsored by Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) -- now has 91 co-sponsors. This means 
that despite the continuous impression given in health-care commentary that no 
sentiment exists in U.S. politics for national health care, nearly a quarter of 
the House is now on record as favoring this approach. 
</P>
<P>
 British-style national health care would be a disaster. But France and Germany 
have national-health systems that provide universal coverage at a significantly 
lower percentage of GNP than the U.S. system, with no rationing, no waiting 
lines, hi-tech care and handsome incomes for doctors. These systems combine 
that best of market medicine -- private practice physicians, privately 
administered insurance pools -- with national cost controls. National health 
care can work. It will work someday in the United States: Maybe sooner than you 
think, especially if what is billed as sweeping health-care reform passes in 
1994, but fails to address the system's root problems of cost runaway and the 
uninsured.

A MATTER OF JUSTICE; PREPARING THE DEFENSE; ASSEMBLING A TEAM AND DEVISING A 
STRATEGY TO DEFEND SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner is past president of the Los Angeles 
County Criminal Bar Assn and counsel of record in 13 capital cases. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than a week, the case of The People of the State of California vs. 
O.J. Simpson has been hijacked by the media's helicopters, mobile units and 
kleig lights. Restoring law and order to the proceedings is now a must. Toward 
that end, Simpson's attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, must now assemble a strong 
legal team to defend against charges that carry sentences of life in prison 
without parole or even the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 On the prosecution side, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, in a break with his 
predecessors' track record, has chosen the "right" attorney for the job. Many 
consider Deputy D.A. Marcia R. Clark the best of the current generation of 
prosecutors. Yet, Garcetti's choice of Deputy D.A. David P. Conn to work with 
Clark also points up the lack of depth in the prosecutor's office: Conn was 
preparing for the Menendez retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti must recognize that not only Simpson's fate is at issue in this case. 
Already, Garcetti and Shapiro have aggressively pursued trial by media, with 
neither exercising much restraint in seeking to influence potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The release last week of 911 tapes purportedly revealing Nicole Brown 
Simpson's attempts to deal with her angry ex-husband represented a despicable 
new low in this war to manage public opinion. Not only are the tapes 
inadmissible in court. They also falsely suggest that past domestic problems 
can predict a future murder. And in an unprecedented action late last week, 
Presiding Superior Court Judge Cecil Mills, concerned that all the pretrial 
publicity may have tainted its deliberations, dissolved the grand jury 
considering Simpson's indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Money, usually a problem in presenting a defense, may, in this case, crimp the 
prosecution. Shapiro's client is a multimillionaire -- the judge in Simpson's 
1992 divorce from Nicole valued his estate at $10 million. The defense bill 
will easily start at a million dollars. By contrast, Garcetti's budget is so 
tight that many hard-core D.A.'s were transferred to the Family Support 
Division last year because that unit receives federal matching funds. Taxpayer 
cost, at a minimum, will be about $500,000, if the trial runs 50 days. This 
figure does not include security expenses, which could run as high as $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether the prosecution's case rests solely on circumstantial 
evidence or whether there are witnesses who can place Simpson at or near the 
crime scene. Highly important is what Simpson told the police after he returned 
from Chicago, since it may be inconsistent with the physical evidence and 
undercut his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal circles, Shapiro is considered a consummate diplomat, an exceptional 
negotiator and a mensch whom people instinctively like on being introduced. He 
is also a good trial lawyer who has never tried a potential death-penalty case. 
Death is different -- always. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Clark "made her bones" last year when she obtained a death 
sentence against Albert Lewis and Anthony Oliver for murdering two worshipers 
in a South-Central church. Before that, she successfully prosecuted Robert 
Bardo, who stalked and killed actress Rebecca Schaeffer. Clark made her 
major-player debut as second chair in the murder prosecution of James Hawkins 
Jr., once celebrated, along with his Watts grocer father, for their running 
battle against street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has a reputation for toughness. Superior Court Judge Marsha N. Revel, 
who presided over the nine-month Hawkins trial in 1987, considered it the 
single ugliest judicial proceeding she has ever participated in. 
</P>
<P>
 In assembling his defense team, Shapiro must play to his and Simpson's 
strengths and weaknesses. His first question is "What are the rules of 
engagement?" Shapiro has stated Simpson is innocent in the murders of his wife, 
Nicole, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. From that premise, the objective is acquittal 
by a jury rather than conviction of a lesser offense. What follows is based on 
preparing for this objective. 
</P>
<P>
 On his legal team, Shapiro needs a fighter, a writer and a "rabbi." 
</P>
<P>
 The fighter . Shapiro must be the offensive strategist but the first half of a 
criminal trial is pure defense. His strength is that people tend to believe 
him. His "fighter" must be skilled in making people disbelieve the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, there is a single objective: Destroy the wall of evidence that the 
prosecutor has built. The job: make sure that no day is a good day for the D.A. 
Job requirements: a) be a good second -- the second chair should be invisible, 
unless Shapiro wants it otherwise; b) good "chemistry" -- unlike non-capital 
cases, death lawyers usually work in teams, and the good teams are virtually 
telepathic, creating a whole far more powerful than either defender can create 
separately; c) experienced in defending murders where pathology (dead bodies), 
serology (blood) and tool-mark identification (what was the weapon?) are 
central issues in the evidence, and d) a long history of defending in capital 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a CNN interview Friday, F. Lee Bailey said he and Alan M. Dershowitz are 
joining the Simpson defense team as consultants. The two are perhaps the 
best-known criminal defense attorneys in the United States. Bailey's clients 
have included Patty Hearst and "Boston Strangler" Albert DeSalvo. Dershowitz's 
clients have included boxer Mike Tyson and socialite Claus von Bulow. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Robert G. Kardashian, a longtime friend of Simpson's, who read aloud 
the long letter written by the former football player, could also play a key 
role in the defense effort. He would probably be most effective as a 
"translator" -- interfacing between his old friend and the lead lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer. Pretrial motions and writs to appellate courts are critical in 
murder cases, especially high-profile potential death-penalty cases. For this 
job, Shapiro has chosen Gerald F. Uelmen, retiring dean of the University of 
Santa Clara Law School and a highly respected criminal-constitutional scholar. 
Job requirements: a) a photographic memory for appellate cases; b) an instinct 
for seeing where legal problems develop, and c) an ability to make the 
prosecutor hear the footsteps of "reversed for misconduct" in the background, 
and cause her to drop the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi . This is the person who Shapiro will call at 1 a.m. to talk to and 
get advice. Generally, defense attorneys perform this function for each other 
as a courtesy. In Simpson's case, however, Shapiro may want to have a "rabbi" 
in waiting. The pressure on him is almost unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 The mandatory "special teams" for cases like Simpson's include a jury 
consultant, pathologist, criminalist, tool-marks specialist, psychiatrist 
(although this tips a change in defense strategy) and investigators. The 
pathologist -- Dr. Michael M. Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York 
City -- and serologist -- Dr. Henry C. Lee, director of the Connecticut state 
police forensic science lab -- have already been chosen. Shapiro may pair up 
Lee with Carol Hunter and Steve Schliebe at the California Laboratory of 
Forensic Science in Tustin. Among defense lawyers, the two have provided the 
laboratory of choice. They also have a record of instinctively knowing what law 
enforcement may be withholding. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice for jury-selection specialist would seem to be obvious. Jo-Ellan 
Heubner Demetrius has played this role in one successful case after another for 
three years, most recently in the trials of Rodney G. King and Reginald O. 
Denny. Focus groups and shadow juries should soon be forming. 
</P>
<P>
 Tool-mark experts (whether instrument "A" caused mark "B") can be critical, 
because they deal with identifying weapons. One of the best is considered to be 
retired LAPD Sgt. David Butler, who ran the department's ballistics and 
firearms laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are the investigators. Zvonko G. (Bill) Pavelic, Shapiro's 
investigator, has a reputation for thoroughness and dedication. He may be 
supplemented by a retired LAPD homicide detective, such as Marvin G. Engquist, 
since defense lawyers regard the LAPD as infamous for playing hide-the-ball 
with evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the legal skirmishing between the two sides has involved whether an 
indictment will be obtained. With the dismissal of the grand jury last week, 
the next step will be a preliminary hearing, which is, by nature, adversarial, 
set for June 30.

 It's time for President Bill Clinton to make a "To Do" list. You know, the 
kind you make when time is getting short and you have to decide what you 
absolutely, positively have to get done before it's too late. In Clinton's 
case, the looming deadline is the 1996 presidential campaign, set to begin 
about a year from now. One likely challenger, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), is 
already lining up a campaign team. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it Clinton absolutely, positively has to accomplish to set himself up 
for reelection in 1996? Five things. 
</P>
<P>
 1. See the country through a crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a tough one. It's kind of hard to manufacture a world crisis. 
Moreover, everything Clinton has done so far suggests that he wants to avoid an 
international crisis at all costs. That can be good foreign policy. But it may 
not be good politics for a young, untested President. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, the Soviets made sure every new President faced a test. 
They needed to see how far they could push him. They tested John F. Kennedy, 
another young Democratic President, in the Cuban missile crisis. He passed with 
flying colors. Earlier than that, Kennedy devised a test of his own -- the Bay 
of Pigs invasion -- three months into his presidency. It was a humiliating 
failure. But it didn't do Kennedy a bit of harm. He handled the defeat with 
such style and grace that Americans were reassured of the new President's 
judgment in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Clinton's problem. The public is not reassured of his judgment in a 
crisis. He hasn't had one. He has done everything possible to avoid 
confrontations in Haiti and North Korea. In Clinton's case, that's not 
necessarily reassuring. Ronald Reagan was the President who had to reassure 
people he wouldn't start a war. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's problem is the opposite. He has to reassure people he can be tough. 
And here's a clue, Mr. President: If you want to relieve doubts about your 
toughness, sending Jimmy Carter doesn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Keep the recovery going.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has already signaled his commitment on this score by not complaining 
about the Federal Reserve Board's decision to hike interest rates. Sure, that 
slows the economy down. But it also lowers the risk of an inflation crisis, 
almost certainly followed by another recession in late 1995 or 1996 -- the 
worst possible time for Clinton. Clinton is making a deliberate choice. He is 
willing to slow the recovery down in order to stretch it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has got to remember one thing: A Democrat who allows a recession is a 
dead Democrat. After all, there's no other reason to elect a Democrat except 
"The economy, stupid." Clinton can't allow that slogan to be used against him 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Be in a position to argue that you have kept your pledge on health care.  
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are out to get Clinton on this. George Bush paid a heavy price 
when he abandoned his "Read my lips: No new taxes" pledge. And no one was 
angrier than his fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Republicans want revenge. They want to force Clinton to abandon his 
pledge to veto any health-care legislation that does not guarantee universal 
coverage. "Nyah, nyah, nyah," they want to say. "Clinton betrayed the Democrats 
just like Bush betrayed the Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 If the President accepts universal coverage as a "goal" or a "commitment" 
rather than an absolute guarantee, the debate will escalate to a higher level 
of childishness. "Did so break your promise," the Republicans would charge. 
"Did not," the Democrats would reply. "Did so!" "Did not!" 
</P>
<P>
 Health care is a high-stakes poker game. Each side is trying to get the other 
to fold first and accept a compromise. Last week, Clinton abandoned his 
compromise posture and told the Business Roundtable, "I refuse to declare 
defeat. Why should we jump in the tank?" 
</P>
<P>
 The President may try to put together a narrow Democratic majority on health 
care, just as he did on the budget bill last year. But even if Clinton ekes out 
another 51-vote triumph, Dole keeps threatening to play the filibuster card.  
</P>
<P>
 Do the Republicans dare filibuster health-care reform? The White House seems 
willing to call their bluff on the theory that the voters would never stand for 
it. Or would they? The political risk of a filibuster depends on how people 
feel about the issue. A filibuster is good if it stops something bad (the 
economic-stimulus bill). It's bad if it stops something good (the Brady bill). 
</P>
<P>
 In this poker game, the Democrats have better cards (more votes and more "face 
cards," i.e., powerful committee chairmen). The Republicans may have the 
advantage on backing -- a majority of Americans now say they oppose the Clinton 
health-care plan. The Republicans -- especially Dole and House Minority Leader 
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) -- have more nerve. But Clinton is a shrewd country boy 
and, like any good poker player, he likes to live on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Deliver on your promise of a middle-class tax cut.  
</P>
<P>
 The voters haven't forgotten that Clinton promised them a tax cut in 1992. 
Instead, Clinton gave them a tax hike. True, the tax hike didn't affect the 
middle class much -- just a few cents more per gallon in gasoline taxes. But 
the voters were offended by the idea that Clinton had reversed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton dares not face the voters again without delivering on his promise. The 
good news is, it won't be hard to do. In fact, it will be easy if, as expected, 
the GOP makes gains in Congress this fall. Republicans have never met a tax cut 
they didn't like. They may try to outbid Clinton, but in the end, whatever tax 
cut the President signs will be his. Moreover, if the economy begins to slow 
down, a tax cut may make good economic sense. Then Clinton can say he delivered 
on his stimulus package. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one big risk Clinton faces in the election this year, and it's the 
last item on his "To Do" list. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Don't let the GOP come out of the midterm with a mandate.  
</P>
<P>
 No one will be surprised if the GOP makes gains this fall. Everyone expects 
this. A more Republican Congress would pull Clinton toward the center. Whenever 
Clinton drifts too far to the left, he gets in trouble. His best bet is to run 
for reelection from the center, on issues like crime, welfare reform and a tax 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 But the GOP gains cannot be so big that they give the Republicans effective 
control of Congress. That would happen if the Republicans win a majority in the 
Senate and pick up as many as 30 House seats -- possible at this point, but not 
likely. If that happened, Republicans would claim their own mandate to govern 
from Congress. They would start passing their own program. Clinton would be 
left with the same unhappy choice as Bush -- capitulate or veto. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's the President's "To Do" list. He'd better not do what most people 
do -- make a list, put it aside and forget about it. The President's best bet 
may be to put it on the refrigerator, where he'll see it all the time.

THE NATION; DESPITE GOP ATTACKS, CLINTON FOREIGN POLICY ECHOS BUSH'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert L. Borosage, Robert L. Borosage is director of the Campaign for New 
Priorities and is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Politics does not stop at the water's edge. These days, Republicans are intent 
on gaining partisan profit from President Bill Clinton's foreign-policy 
travails. Yet, GOP lead ers agree on little other than their opposition to 
Administration policies that, ironically, often mirror those of Republican 
predecessors. GOP rhetoric has grown more partisan even as the President's 
policy has become less so. This political posturing is displacing the 
much-needed debate about America's global role. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP congressional leaders and presidential hopefuls delight in assailing the 
Administration for getting it wrong. Congress echoes with accusations that 
Clinton has been too passive toward Korea; too bellicose toward Haiti; too avid 
in Somalia, too reluctant in Bosnia. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas 
says the President "plans to gut defense."  
</P>
<P>
 Attacks have reached scurrilous extremes. When "friendly fire" from U.S. jets 
tragically downed U.S. helicopters over Iraq, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) charged that the accident was merely a "symptom of the decay" caused by 
Clinton's defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans agree on little other than their opposition to Clinton. 
Patrick J. Buchanan, who has pocketed more votes in Republican primaries than 
any other GOP presidential contender, insists the United States, having won the 
Cold War, should come home. He would remove troops from Korea and Europe, cut 
the military budget, pull out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and 
abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement. He argues it is time to put 
America First. Dole, whom polls place at the head of the GOP's presidential 
candidates for 1996, disagrees totally. He wants the United States to lead, to 
be "first among equals," -- as in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Any party that spans the gulf from Virginia zealot Oliver L. North to Oregon's 
peaceable Sen. Mark O. Hatfield will harbor disagreements about policy, but 
even at the GOP's center, disagreements abound. Dole, a veteran of World War 
II, urged the Administration to bomb the Serbs in Bosnia, promising "strong 
bipartisan support in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 When the President did order the planes in, conservative Republican Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona, the Vietnam veteran and the party's leading voice on 
military matters, scorned "feckless pinprick air strikes" and dismissed "with 
some disdain" those who believe air strikes could have any effect. McCain is 
now calling for preemptive bombing of North Korea's nuclear facilities, whereas 
Dole has been more restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican attacks tend to focus on management. They indict Clinton for 
flip-flopping, for sending confused signals, for squandering U.S. credibility, 
hoping they can merge his foreign-policy missteps, Paula Corbin Jones and 
Whitewater into one large character indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 These attacks neglect to mention that most of Clinton's U-turns have been in 
one direction: away from liberal positions he took in the campaign toward 
policies similar to those of the Bush Administration. The most recent 
illustration was when Clinton discarded his pledge not to "coddle dictators" 
and adopted the Bush Administration's approach toward China, severing the link 
between human-rights practices and U.S. trading privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in virtually every major area of foreign policy -- from peddling 
"shock therapy" to Russia and Eastern Europe, to the peace process in the 
Middle East, to trade relations with Japan -- the Clinton Administration has 
ended up following the course set by the Bush Administration. The President 
waged his largest foreign-policy battle against his own labor and environmental 
allies in support of NAFTA, an agreement largely negotiated by the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been bedeviled by crises in small places -- Somalia, 
Haiti, Bosnia and Korea -- but the policies pursued would not have been notably 
different had Bush been reelected. The large U.S. force in Somalia was sent 
there by President George Bush. Clinton went aground in Haiti by adopting a 
Bush policy, including the repugnant treatment of refugees, which even Bush's 
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, in an unfortunate choice of words, 
called "dead in the water." If Clinton ends up invading Haiti, he will walk in 
the footsteps of Ronald Reagan in Grenada and Bush in Panama, who showed that 
invading a small neighboring country is a good way to look tough on the cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, the Administration is echoing the Bush Administration's policy. 
Both addressed Bosnia as a European problem; both have sought to help end the 
conflict without getting U.S. troops involved. Both expressed sympathy for the 
plight of the Bosnians -- while pushing them to partition their lands for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward North Korea, the Administration's policy is not so different from the 
Bush reaction in 1989 -- when the first diversion of nuclear fuel apparently 
took place. McCain argues the Administration's "failures elsewhere in the 
world" have eroded U.S. credibility, but Bush's victory in Desert Storm did not 
seem to make much of an impression on Kim Il Sung. If North Korea has one or 
two nuclear weapons, as CIA analysts suggest, it developed them on Bush's 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of partisan posturing and policy continuity has displaced the 
serious debate about the U.S. role in the world that is surely in order with 
the end of the Cold War. The country faces inescapable challenges: 
reconstructing the economy at home, rebuilding Russia and Eastern Europe, 
restructuring global economic institutions, redressing the growing North-South 
divide, responding to growing environmental threats and more. But sensible 
discussion of these matters goes unheard beneath Republican baying about 
Clinton's mismanaged foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best example is the GOP's indictment of Clinton's defense plan, an 
area where Republicans are most unified and most acidic. McCain charges the 
Administration "has emasculated the military." Dole says Clinton is producing a 
"hollow military." Former Bush Defense Secretary Dick Cheney seems to believe 
he can win the presidential nomination running against the President's defense 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 This is mostly hot air. With the end of the Cold War, military spending fell, 
with the savings used to address budget and investment deficits. The Bush 
Administration cobbled together an interim defense plan after the Warsaw Pact 
collapsed, while the Soviet Union was still intact. It called for the United 
States to maintain active duty forces needed to fight two wars, simultaneously, 
at opposite ends of the world, without allies -- while bringing U.S. military 
spending down by about 30% over six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Soviet Union collapsed and the Russian military budget plummeted to 
less than $30 billion a year. Clinton was elected. Clinton allowed the Pentagon 
to undertake its own review of U.S. military plans. The result naturally 
reaffirmed the Bush one world-two wars plan, while paring projected spending 
less than 9% -- with much coming by slowing pay increases and projecting lower 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will still spend about $1.3 trillion over five years on military 
forces -- only marginally smaller than the Bush force, despite the fact that 
the Soviet Union disappeared in the interim. Next year's military spending is 
projected at $270 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Republicans would have us believe that the President is engaged in 
unilateral disarmament. Republicans charge Clinton has "cut beyond the bone." 
The President responds by "drawing the line" against further cuts. The 
opportunity to change priorities offered by the collapse of the Soviet Union is 
lost in the fog. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cold War over, a real debate about the U.S. world role is needed. 
Instead we witness a Gresham's law of politics: Counterfeit partisan posturing 
displaces real policy debate. No wonder Americans have learned to hate 
politics.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; STUDENTS' HATE CRIME SHOULDN'T GO UNPUNISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CROMER, Mark Cromer is the editor of Low Magazine, a publication on the 
campus of Cal Poly, Pomona. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Bridge's story didn't rank with O.J. Simpson's last week, but that's 
not too surprising. Bridge is not a former football player, nor a television 
and film celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 A 35-year-old former television game-show producer, Bridge left the industry 
to become a teacher. He signed on with the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
taking a post at Crenshaw High School, where he taught drama and literature for 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 That all came to an end in April when Bridge was, in effect, lynched by 
students at the high school because he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly not news that teachers in many of our public schools have to 
put up with back-talk, obscenities and even occasional threats. But the student 
assault on Bridge, which began when his sexual orientation became public 
knowledge, takes crime in our public schools -- in this case, a hate crime -- 
to a new low. 
</P>
<P>
 During an earthquake drill at the school, for example, Bridge was surrounded 
by hostile students on a stairwell and repeatedly called "Faggot! Faggot!" 
While conducting class, students passing in the hallway would open the door to 
his classroom and taunt him with epithets. His own students passed up no 
opportunity to inquire about his sex life. 
</P>
<P>
 Where were his fellow-faculty members and school administrators? 
</P>
<P>
 A pretty good idea of where they were is suggested by how they responded to a 
proposal, by Crenshaw Principal Yvonne Noble, to sponsor a gay group to spread 
awareness and understanding. They declined. One teacher reportedly said, "I'm 
not a faggot." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, no one meaningfully defended Bridge's dignity and human 
rights. No student marches. No teach-ins by faculty. No protests from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Those students who did have the guts to support Bridge apparently were 
subjected to ridicule on the ground that since they were defending a gay 
teacher, they must be gay, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, students seemed proud of their success in forcing Bridge to quit 
teaching. One summed up the episode by saying, "It's not a dislike; it's a hate 
of gays." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. An ugly, twisted, perverted hate driven by fear and fueled by 
ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 The students who verbally attacked Bridge should be charged with a hate crime. 
They should be identified and suspended. Readmittance to a school in the 
district should hinge on completion of a "decency" or "respect" course. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the teachers and administrators -- how else to describe their silence 
than as collaboration. The district should draw up and institute strict 
guidelines on how "role models" should respond to such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, millions of gays and lesbians, as well as those who support equal 
rights for all regardless of sexual orientation, celebrate the 25th anniversary 
of the Stonewall riots, a watershed moment in gay history. Despite important 
progress since then, the "lynching" of Martin Bridge proves there is still so 
much hate to overcome.

BUS FARE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Planned Fare Hike Points Up Inequities in Bus, Rail Subsidies," June 18: 
</P>
<P>
 I am no rocket scientist.However, when the MTA reports that it subsidizes the 
operating costs at a rate of $1.16 per passenger on its buses, except on its 
most crowded lines, which require subsidies of only 34 cents, then the answer 
to MTA's money problems seems to be to lower the fares, stupid! 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the more passengers using the bus lines, the lower the costs. Let's 
go for it, folks. That's my tax money you are wasting, and it's got to stop.

SANTA MONICA HIGH YEARBOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Controversy is the basis for spicy journalism. The fact that Santa Monica 
High School's yearbook is an impressive show of students' creativity is not. In 
the June 17 article on this year's Nautilus, your reporter took far-fetched 
rumors that the yearbook was racist, satanic and explicit, and printed them as 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening section of the yearbook, our homecoming page is titled with a 
typographical error. You (reported the inference) that this was a racial slur. 
The yearbook staff proved that the accusation was false by showing your 
reporter a letter from the printer apologizing for the error. In fact, 
minorities were represented fairly, as is evident from the racial integration 
of the candid pictures in the yearbook. But that doesn't make a good story. 
</P>
<P>
 You reported that when the yearbook's cover is looked at upside down, the 
reader is "jolted" by the word Satan hidden in the title. The yearbook's title, 
"Nautilus," and "Satan" contain many of the same letters, the first, middle and 
last of which are the same both upside down and right side up. The word Satan 
is neither intended nor readily apparent to the eye. But that doesn't make a 
good story. 
</P>
<P>
 You wrote that there was a "nude drawing of school mascot Vicky Viking" on the 
cover. The drawing, however, was not our mascot stripped of her uniform, but 
instead the depiction of a bronzed statue of a woman, much like you would find 
in the UCLA sculpture garden. But that doesn't make a good story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times should be ashamed to give any of these unsubstantiated rumors 
credibility. But they made a good story.

 * After reading about the controversy over the Santa Monica High School

series of ink blots to a patient. After every example the doctor asked him what 
he saw. The patient responded to every example by saying that he saw people 
engaged in various sex acts. The doctor said to the patient, "You are 
apparently preoccupied with sex." The patient responded, "Me? You're the one 
with the dirty pictures."

COMMUNITY POLICING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After reading "In South-Central, Concerns Rise on Community Policing" (June 
13), I'm confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been a block captain for over a year, I find no political or "control" 
problems. The community-based policing concept showed its immeasurable value 
during the earthquake of Jan. 17, as neighbors pitched in to help other 
neighbors. The concept I have of community-based policing is neighbor to 
neighbor, with guidance from various city officials and groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 I regret that a few dissidents in South-Central will cause disruption and 
suspicion of the program, which offers hope and options to all who participate.

FRANKLIN D. MURPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I speak not only for myself but for our Hebrew Union College community in 
expressing bereavement at the death of a dear friend and mentor, Dr. Franklin 
D. Murphy (June 17). He was an inspiration to the college, his honorary alma 
mater, and offered invaluable help and guidance in our efforts for the Skirball 
Cultural Center under construction in Sepulveda Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Murphy devoted himself with astonishing and bracing distinction to the 
task of elevating the cultural, aesthetic and moral as well as physical level 
of his fellow human beings. I personally had abundant reason to love and admire 
him for the way he broadened my own perspective and for the serious discussions 
we had about Jewish fate and the goals of the Skirball Cultural Center. Dr. 
Murphy revealed a great affection and respect for the Jewish people and their 
contribution to our common civilization. 
</P>

GAY TEACHER DRIVEN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "A Painful Lesson for a Gay Teacher, June 18: 
</P>
<P>
 While I completely understand the pain and outrage felt by Martin Bridge over 
the gay bashing that forced him out of teaching at Crenshaw High School, I 
think it is important to point out that it isn't like that at every school. 
Given the ignorance that surrounds the subject of homosexuality, certainly the 
potential for hateful behavior on the part of students and teachers always 
exists. But through the years, there have been some school administrators who 
have encouraged an atmosphere of respect for diversity and a zero tolerance for 
the kind of name-calling and harassment that was described by Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that most gay and lesbian teachers still remain closeted for fear 
that what happened at Crenshaw might happen to them. This tragic fact is not 
only a profound indictment of the educational system and its leadership, but 
also an incalculable loss to those gay and lesbian students who desperately 
need role models and support if they are to stay in school at all.

 * I've been a substitute teacher at Wilmington Middle School for the better 
part of the past three months. As a gay man, I'm sensitive to anti-gay rhetoric 
and know of what Bridge speaks. Unlike Bridge, however, who was crippled by the 
hateful comments of students, I was appalled by the comments of my fellow 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 22, local clergy admonished their parishioners to keep students home 
the following Tuesday in protest of LAUSD's gay-awareness month. Much 
discussion ensued at school that week, but the unkind rhetoric of the kids 
paled in comparison to what some of the teachers had to say. That Tuesday 
afternoon an impromptu discussion convened in the main office after school, 
where teachers expressed views generously peppered with adjectives such as 
"evil, unnatural and disgusting" while referencing homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a very disturbing experience to hear such fear/hate-based ignorance 
coming from the very educators expected to effectively address anti-gay 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems premature for the Los Angeles school district to promote classroom 
awareness when the very conveyors of that awareness are themselves drowning in 
ignorance.

Bridge went on sick leave. The vocal mob of students who participated in these 
idiotic acts can now pat themselves on the back for losing one of the best 
teachers at Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials must inform students that gay bashing is not acceptable. The 
name-calling students should be required to participate in a little 
role-playing exercise, where gay people are in the majority and have outlawed 
heterosexuality. In order to survive, the minority of straight people must 
sneak around and try to pass themselves as gay to avoid being verbally or 
physically bashed for expressing their natural sexuality.

FARMER IN RAT HABITAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing in response to "Immigrant Farmer's Woes Galvanize 
Conservatives," June 10. In this case, a Taiwanese immigrant is accused of 
violating the Endangered Species Act.His tractor allegedly ran over five Tipton 
kangaroo rats in the Kern County area. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted is Arthur Unger, local Sierra Club president, saying, "How can we sit 
here and play God and say, 'This species we'll let go?' " 
</P>
<P>
 This form of environmental engineering is a form of "playing God," too. I 
wonder how many tax dollars were spent on the surveillance, raid and arrest, 
including over two dozen officers and helicopters, and how much will be spent 
in court? This is another example of the overweight bureaucracy of 
land-grabbing environmentalism that has become this generation's greatest ruse 
for making a "guiltless" buck. 
</P>
<P>
 The real endangered species is common sense.

 * I am totally unsympathetic toward Taung Ming-Lin. What Taung needs is a 
lesson in how free-market capitalism works.  
</P>
<P>
 Taung was a former importer in Taiwan and a bookbinder here in California. He 
had no experience in either real estate or in farming. This is a business that 
he had no business being in. He did not familiarize himself with the laws 
governing his farming profession. This is a tragic mistake in any business. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of familiarity with the farming business was not the fault of either 
the federal government or of the Endangered Species Act. Sadly, Taung Ming-Lin 
paid upward of $2 million for his education in capitalism.

LEARN'S REFORMS: LAST STOP BEFORE VOUCHERS OR BREAKUP?; FOR AILING SCHOOL 
DISTRICT, THE BROAD-BASED COALITION REMAINS THE BEST HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LEARN(Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now) is at a critical 
juncture in its attempt to remake public education in Los Angeles. LEARN is 
probably the last, best chance to keep public education here viable. If the 
reform effort does not get the support it requires from the administration of 
the Los Angeles Unified School District, and from parents and teachers, it will 
fail and the arguments against more drastic "solutions" -- vouchers or even the 
breakup of the district itself -- will seem far less compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Let that reality be a fire particularly under the LAUSD's administration, 
which must break out of a numbingly bureaucratic mind-set that reactively 
asserts why something cannot be done, not how it can be. When a school wants to 
innovate, too often the district responds by making the change hard if not 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: One school that was working to involve more parents decided it needed 
a newsletter, and a teacher volunteered to type it. Somehow the central 
administration office heard about this, and soon the teacher got a memo telling 
her that teachers could not do typing, only "classified" (secretaries and 
others) could. This is the sort of maddening, counterproductive irritation -- 
fueled sometimes by protective union rules or by-the-book bureaucrats trying to 
justify their existence -- that occurs daily within the LAUSD. The district 
must become less a slave to rules and more an advocate for allowing a school to 
do what makes sense for that campus -- in spite of the rules. Right now, too 
many parents, principals and teachers see the central bureaucracy as an 
obstacle to change and flexibility, not a facilitator. The school board, 
composed of part-time members, can prod the bureaucracy to fix specific 
problems but that merely prompts the LAUSD to keep a staff of administrators to 
run around putting out political fires. Nothing in this setup encourages the 
kind of systemic change and local school control that is regularly responsive 
to student and parent needs. 
</P>
<P>
 GETTING WORD TO THE COMMUNITY: LEARN, a coalition of business, community, 
educator and parent leaders, entered this muddled picture in 1991. Schools 
officially began signing on to the effort last year. Much of the LEARN focus 
thus far has been on reforming how decisions are made at the local school 
level, and working to ensure more school-site control. So far, 87 of the 
district's 870 schools are LEARN schools. Now LEARN needs to do a better job of 
answering this often-asked question: Just what does it mean to be a LEARN 
school? 
</P>
<P>
 Already the LAUSD has magnet schools, charter schools and LEARN schools -- 
designations that can be confusing. Actually any school can be a LEARN school 
if the faculty and parents agree to sign on. LEARN must get the word out: It is 
not a specific instructional program or a formula handed out to instantly make 
schools better. LEARN is simply an umbrella name for all the parents, educators 
and civic-minded Angelenos determined to make the schools responsive, 
accountable and the best they can be. LEARN has set up a process to make that 
happen and offers a key reform tool -- privately funded training -- to parents, 
teachers, principals and other school employees. The idea is everyone should be 
rowing in the same direction, and training helps. 
</P>
<P>
 AVERTING CHANGE FROM 'OUTSIDE': Now those who work full-time in this 
restructuring effort, including Mike Roos, the former state Assembly leader who 
is credited with giving LEARN the political savvy it needed to get broad-based 
support, must take it further. Parents and teachers need to see that the 
primary benefit of LEARN is that it breaks through obstructionist red tape so 
that parents and educators are free to permeate the public schools with the 
"can do" spirit -- banishing the "can't do, won't do, don't have to" attitude 
too often in evidence in the LAUSD. Change happens in many little ways, with 
lots of small victories, and it takes time. Do teachers, principals, parents, 
school employees, administrators have the political will to stick to it, to 
work to change the way public schools are run, to change the very culture? They 
must. Otherwise, change will be imposed from the outside, and it won't 
necessarily be for the better. One way or another, change is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 What parents and teachers care most about is what goes on in the classroom. 
Performance must improve. LEARN is on the tough but necessary journey leading 
to that improvement. When parents and teachers see that being a LEARN school 
can mean that school life is better -- that parents are heard and involved, 
that teachers are set free to teach, that students learn and can demonstrate 
steady improvement -- everyone will be demanding to be under the LEARN 
umbrella. And if the LAUSD administration is smart, it will be leading the 
charge to make it happen.

COLUMN LEFT/ GLORIA STEINEM: CODIFYING INDIFFERENCE AND EXCLUSION; CONGRESS 
WOULD PROTECT MANUFACTURERS' INTERESTS TO THE DETRIMENT OF WOMEN'S HEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLORIA STEINEM, Gloria Steinem, the co-founder of Ms. magazine, is the 
author of Moving Beyond Words (Simon & Schuster, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week, the U.S. Senate will consider legislation that would take a heavy 
toll on the health of women in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 By virtue of our need for contraception, care during pregnancy and other 
results of our reproductive character, women have been the victims of many of 
the worst drug and medical-device disasters. Our general health concerns have 
long been ignored. If enacted, this legislation would codify this indifference 
and exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the manufacturers of known and suspected dangerous substances, 
drugs and medical devices have pursued legislative means to limit the ability 
of injured parties to recover damages. The Product Liability Fairness Act is 
their latest attempt -- and it is dangerously close to succeeding. If it 
passes, state laws that protect victims would be preempted by new, restrictive 
federal statutes that protect the financial interests of manufacturers, even 
when they have engaged in unconscionable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers fall disproportionately into two categories: low-wage earners and 
victims of dangerous drugs and medical devices like DES, the Copper-7 and 
Dalkon Shield IUDs, silicone breast implants, high-estrogen contraceptives and 
super-absorbent tampons. In other words, women. 
</P>
<P>
 As one can imagine, multinational corporations are aggressive backers of the 
bill -- among them General Motors, Exxon, DuPont, Dow Corning (maker of the 
silicone breast implant) and Eli Lilly (maker of DES). Every major consumer 
organization as well as women's organizations, senior citizens' groups and 
labor unions are against this legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, fighting multimillion-dollar corporate strategies isn't easy. 
Because of their efforts, some people and certainly some senators mistakenly 
believe that rationing justice to plaintiffs is the right thing to do. They 
must be told that the vast majority of victims of defective products never file 
suit; that business insurance premiums and payouts are a tiny fraction of 1% of 
business revenues, and that winning a products case is not only difficult but 
also costly for the plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
 The deception created by proponents of this legislation is obvious when one 
sees the faces and hears the stories of the millions of women who have lost the 
ability to bear children because a manufacturer, even knowing the risks, chose 
to keep a dangerous product on the market. There are the thousands given DES 
during pregnancy, sometimes without their knowledge or consent, and whose 
children bear the tragic consequences. There are the thousands who lost their 
reproductive capacity from uterine infections and perforated uteruses, and some 
who died, because they used the Dalkon Shield IUD. 
</P>
<P>
 This bill particularly harms women because it would sometimes limit an injured 
person's ability to be fully compensated for the pain and suffering caused by a 
defective productive. Such damages compensate for intangible losses, such as 
fertility, disfigurement or the loss of a fetus. Because of the "glass ceiling" 
in the executive suite, the "sticky floor" of the pink-collar ghetto and other 
societal factors, women in general earn less than men. Therefore, compensation 
for injury other than lost wages is often a larger component of a woman's 
claims. In addition, many products designed for women have led to spontaneous 
abortions, miscarriages and permanent sterility -- injuries with a low dollar 
value in economic terms, but a high value to women. By assigning a lower value 
to such injuries, the bill relegates women to a second-class status. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of dangerous drugs and medical devices would be shielded from 
punishment as long as the product received approval from the federal 
government. This provision in the bill would have protected the makers of 
diethylstilbestrol, or DES, which was marketed as an anti-miscarriage drug 
after approval from the FDA, despite evidence at the time that the drug caused 
cancer and malformed reproductive organs in animals. What is worse, DES was 
also known to have absolutely no therapeutic value in preventing miscarriage. 
Yet it was sold for more than 20 years, ultimately affecting 10 million women 
and children.  
</P>
<P>
 In sum, the Product Liability Fairness Act would seriously endanger women's 
health by removing incentives for manufacturers to recall unsafe products and 
by undermining the ability of women to receive full recoveries for injuries. 
Surely there is a better way to address the concerns of businesses -- 
especially those so intimately involved in women's health.

PLATFORM; HOW TO SLAKE OUR PARCHED STATE'S THIRST -- IT'S IN THE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. GLEICK, PETER H. GLEICK directs the global environment program of 
the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security in 
Oakland. He has a sunny outlook on California's water problems: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians have agonized for decades over the state's long-term water 
problems: How can we satisfy ever growing demands for water in a region as dry 
as ours?  
</P>
<P>
 What a tremendous sense of relief, then, to hear that the solution has been 
discovered: On June 2, astronomers from the radio astronomy laboratory of UC 
Berkeley announced that they had discovered the existence of water in Markarian 
1, a galaxy 200 million light years away, ironically in the constellation 
Pisces, or fish.This discovery should end once and for all those endless 
arguments Californians have had about limiting our population growth, halting 
immigration, constraining our agricultural production or reducing our 
inefficient uses of water. We can simply continue to import it from farther and 
farther away as we use up or contaminate our modest resources here. Indeed, the 
fact that astronomers have been able to see water so far from Earth suggests 
that there must be a lot of it out there -- certainly enough for any future 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Markarian 1 may be kind of far away, our water engineers can surely 
design a way to get it here. Oh, it may take a while to get the celestial 
aqueduct operating -- after all, 200 million light years away isn't around the 
corner -- but that will give us plenty of time to tow all the icebergs, drain 
Alaska and Canada and desalinate the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 I just hope we won't have to file an environmental-impact statement.

THE STATE; FOR L.A., WORLD CUP IS MORE THAN SOCCER GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow at the Center for the New West and an international fellow at the 
Pepperdine University School of Business in Los Angeles. He is also 
business-trends analyst for Fox TV. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As did the Olympics a decade ago, the World Cup represents far more than a 
$600-million short-term stimulus to the local economy. After five years of 
man-made and natural disasters, the games offer an opportunity to redefine the 
region in terms of its global, multiracial future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles of 1984 was, in many ways, quite dependent on the rest of 
America, bulking up on Pentagon steroids and selling to a mostly domestic 
audience. By contrast, the primary markets of companies that represent Southern 
California's future are European, East Asian, Latin American and African. It is 
fans from these regions who crowd the shops and restaurants of Pasadena's 
Colorado Avenue. They and recent immigrants, with their passion for the game 
they call futbol , are the absolute key to restructuring California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup, with a worldwide audience three times that of the Super Bowl, 
has catapulted Los Angeles to the center of the global community and has done 
so, for a change, in a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism will probably be the first industry to benefit from the exposure. Even 
before the games, almost one in four visitors to the region were from abroad. 
Domestic tourism remains lackluster, but foreign tourists, despite a turndown 
from Japan, have surged, and most of them come from Central America, Mexico, 
Korea and the rest of non-Japanese Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dependency on these tourists is expected to grow markedly. By the year 2000, 
according to the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau, the number of foreign 
travelers to the United States will rise by 75% compared with a 9% expected 
growth rate for domestic travel. 
</P>
<P>
 But even more important, the foreigners and recent immigrants who live here, 
the key markets for the World Cup, may prove critical to reconstructing the 
region's shattered self-confidence. In fact, at a time when much of the U.S. 
mainstream press has all but written off California, and particularly Southern 
California, European publications such as the Economist and the Financial Times 
have tended to be far more balanced, even upbeat, in their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners have also become good customers of the region's goods and services. 
As our largest single U.S. customer, the Pentagon, has cut back spending by 
more than $20 billion a year, the regional economy has become increasingly 
reliant on its global trade connections for job creation and economic growth. 
Between 1988 and 1993, according to World Trade Center Assn., the value of 
international trade passing through the Los Angeles custom district expanded 
from $32 billion to more than $48 billion. Next year, Los Angeles' 
trade-related economy, only two decades ago one-quarter that of New York's, 
should be the nation's leader. The trade boom has created as many as 320,000 
jobs during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large extent, this rapid growth reflects the reality that, despite 
widespread economic pessimism, Californians continue to produce goods and 
services demanded all over the world. During the past year, the Economist 
notes, exports of California's key core industries -- from high-tech industrial 
equipment to processed food -- have been rapidly expanding even as their 
national rivals experienced an overall drop in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, virtually every growing sector of the regional economy, from 
high-tech equipment and business services to entertainment and agriculture, 
relies increasingly on international trade to sustain its growth. Fast-growing 
firms, such as Taylor-Dunn in Anaheim, which exports electric vehicles to 
Mexico and East Asia, or telecommunications manufacturer Pairgain Technologies 
in Cerritos, regard international sales as critical to expansion. Often, 
company executives report, California's qualitative edge is better appreciated 
abroad than in the rest of country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunkist oranges and lemons from the groves of Ventura County and the San 
Joaquin Valley are widely considered the world's best, but few end up in local 
supermarkets since Japanese and Asian consumers routinely buy virtually all the 
top-of-the-line crop. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's qualitative edge is also evident in such related fields as food 
processing, which benefits by virtue of its access to the nation's most 
adaptive agriculture; a well-developed machinery industry; the largest and 
best-positioned ports, and the most cutting-edge market for health-related and 
ethnic foods. Southern California, for example, is arguably the world's 
single-largest exporter of Mexican food products, with one Southland firm, Casa 
Herrera, even selling its tortilla-making equipment to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, California's high-technology industries dominate U.S. exports, 
accounting for 27% of all electrical machinery and 20% of industrial-machinery 
sales abroad. Indeed, a large share of the leading producers of high-technology 
products -- from computers to software, from biotechnology to engineering 
services -- are based and most heavily concentrated in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In entertainment-related products, the domination is even more marked, with 
Hollywood commanding virtually every global market open to competition. By the 
year 2000, overseas sales could well be responsible for up to half the 
industry's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing better reflects the World Cup's significance to Los Angeles than 
the immigrants and youngsters most intrigued by soccer. They make up the prime 
market for entrepreneurs like Morocco-reared Ben Amer, who runs Attack Sports, 
a firm that manufactures soccer shirts and other paraphernalia. Amer, who 
co-hosted the team from Cameroon, sees the immigrants and the 
under-12-year-olds in the suburbs as transforming Southern California into a 
new "soccer capital" for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the region's huge Latino population has been energized by the 
games. "It's impossible to overestimate their impact," says Jose Lozano, 
publisher of La Opinion, the nation's largest Spanish-language paper. "It 
reflects the incredible importance Los Angeles has as an immigrant city." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup, Lozano adds, helps to "reintegrate" newcomers into the civic 
culture. Even the generational split widely observed at the U.S.-Mexico 
exhibition game -- parents supporting Mexico, kids rooting for the Americans -- 
suggests that assimilation, with all its contradictions and problems, 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the games have focused national attention on the growing 
economic clout of the Southland's Latino community, whose domestic product now 
exceeds that of most major U.S. metropolitan areas. Boosted by new national 
clients, advertising revenues at La Opinion, for example, have grown by double 
digits, compared with last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 With the U.S. team's upset victory over the highly touted Colombians, the 
enthusiasm for World Cup now evident in Latino, European, African and Asian 
communities may spread to the largely indifferent Anglo mainstream. If so, the 
region's languishing self-confidence may get the kick in the pants it so 
desperately needs.*

<P>
 * COMMUNITY GROUP FUNDING: Approved the use of $10,000 from city coffers to 
partially fund several community organizations in Holden's Council District 10. 
Among those to receive money are the Cherrywood Avenue Block Club, the 29th 
Street Block Club, the Lafayette Square Block Club, the Hauser Avenue Block 
Club and the 10th District Women's Steering Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * WYATT EARP MEMORIAL: Approved a motion recognizing that 4004 West 17th St. 
-- currently the address of Mount Vernon Junior High School -- was once the 
site of legendary lawman Wyatt Earp's summer home. The motion requests that the 
Los Angeles Unified School District install a commemorative marker at the site. 
Earp, who died in 1929, spent his summers in Los Angeles the last 25 years of 
his life. Councilman Nate Holden, presenter of the motion, said: "We need more 
Wyatt Earps today to make our city safer." 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFERING: Approved offering a $25,000 reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the persons responsible for the murder of 
Ismael Salinas, who was shot to death May 28 by two men who came to his front 
door at 1938 W. Manchester Boulevard. Salinas, 40, was celebrating his 
daughter's 15th birthday at the time of the shooting. The suspects apparently 
were panhandling when they came to Salinas' house. 
</P>
<P>
 * LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT: Authorized the city attorney to withdraw $195,000 from 
the city's reserve fund to settle a lawsuit with Jerri Brown, who sued the city 
for assault and battery by the Los Angeles Police Department, false 
imprisonment and violation of her civil rights. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * HOPE IN YOUTH: Approved the Community Development Department's selection of 
Catholic Charities, a 75-year-old nonprofit organization, to serve as the 
administrator of the city's Hope in Youth Project. The main objectives of the 
project are to provide alternative activities for gang members, create 
independent parent organizations that will be involved with school functions 
and to build a support network for parents whose families have been hurt by 
gang violence. The plan also calls for Catholic Charities to select up to eight 
subcontractor organizations to assist it in operating the Hope in Youth 
Project. Passed 12-0. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Mike Hernandez, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters, Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg, Rudy Svorinich Jr.

VOICES: EL MARIACHI; THE HOURS CAN BE LONG AND LATE, THE WORK HARD TO FIND, BUT 
TRADITION COMPELS THE STROLLING MINSTRELS TO CONTINUE PRACTICING THEIR UNIQUE 
DOOR-TO-DOOR ARTISTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOSE JESUS VARGAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Music has been Jose Jesus Vargas' muse since he was a boy. As a teen-ager, the 
Jalisco, Mexico, native learned to play mariachi and that soon became his 
passion. When he moved to the United States in 1966 -- eventually settling in 
Maywood, where he and his wife raised a family of three -- he brought that love 
and his instruments with him.  
</P>
<P>
 Nightly for 10 years, Vargas has waited at 1st Street and Boyle Avenue in 
Boyle Heights for the chance to serenade for hire. Borrowing a ritual from 
Mexico City's famed Plaza Garibaldi, mariachis have gathered there for 50 
years. When business is slow, they stroll the old neighborhood, stepping into 
restaurants and cantinas to play for tips.  
</P>
<P>
 Those tips don't add up to much. But for "musicos" like Vargas, being a 
mariachi is more than a job -- it's keeping a tradition alive. Last month, the 
city approved a plan that will designate a stretch of sidewalk at 1st and Boyle 
as Mariachi Plaza, giving musicians like Vargas, 56, a sense of legitimacy and 
approval. Vargas was interviewed by Staff Writer Kevin Baxter.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here the city has treated us well. The city has given us a facility for our 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever you go, the musicos know about this plaza. Musicos come here from 
Texas, from Mexico or wherever because they know this plaza exists for the 
musicos to meet. For us, it's a great thing to have a place to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 I can say that there are musicos looking for work in every area of Los Angeles 
because there are a lot of musicos here. But this place has a long history and 
it is here that people meet to make up their groups. It's a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing we offer is, artistically we present in different ways the music and 
folklore of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 I started to play when I was very small, but I didn't start playing mariachi 
until I was about 18. I played in the same little town, Chapala. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been the leader of my group for a long time but I don't like to be the 
boss. I like my work but I feel like the real one in charge of us is the boss 
who pays us for the songs we play. 
</P>
<P>
 Our job is not like painting or hammering a nail. Our thing is an art and it 
has to be well-paid. However, here they don't appreciate that and they pay us 
very little. Usually we ask for $5 a song. What I really want to charge is $10, 
but no one is going to pay that. 
</P>
<P>
 We earn $100 for the weekend. Sometimes we earn $200. But it's not something 
stable, our job. It would be good if there was something more secure. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a group of six people. You really can't have any more than six because 
then when you divide up the money, there won't be enough to make it worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule we have here is we are supposed to wear uniforms, more or less 
similar uniforms. We are to be here certain hours and work hard. Everything is 
work. If we don't work hard, no one is going to pay us to play. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to practice and understand the melodies that the people want us to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 I know how to do other things. I'm a painter. And, above all, I can also work 
in the fields. But I like this work because, in reality, at my age, they're not 
going to give me much work elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people who live around here don't like us. Sometimes a lot of the people, 
the ones they call cholos and people like them, they come rob us, assault us 
and carry on. They tried to rob me one night but I didn't let them. I fought 
them off. They wanted to take the money I had to bring home to my family. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone can fight them off. I think that the government should arrest 
all these people. These people need to be taught a lesson or put in a place 
where they can be watched all the time. Put them to work so that they can't 
cause trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 I like the protection that we have now from the city. They treat us like 
productive people, not like parasites. Our labor is to come to work, and what 
we earn stays here in the city. I give thanks that they realize that we're 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work we get is by phone; people call us and ask us to play. When 
we have no calls, we go out to the plaza at around 5 in the afternoon and we'll 
be out until 1:30 or 2 in the morning waiting for someone to ask us to play or 
playing in the bars and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we do poorly during the week because of the high unemployment; 
there's no one in the bars who can afford to pay us. Sometimes we'll go to two 
or three bars and we get nothing. In six hours, we might make between $12 and 
$15.  
</P>
<P>
 In the mornings, I work with the Mexican-American Opportunity Foundation. 
That's a group for older people; there's no one younger than 55. I go there and 
practice my violin and the foundation sends me to hospitals and schools to play 
for people. 
</P>
<P>
 I still support five people -- my kids and my wife. My son learned to play 
music, but he didn't like it that much. He didn't like to practice. My 
daughters I taught to play guitar. They're in a church choir. 
</P>
<P>
 I play violin right now. Before, I played the trumpet more than 20 years. And, 
well, I know how to play different instrumentos. It's important to know how to 
play a lot of different instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't really thought about how long I'm going to continue doing this. But 
I do want to go back to Mexico because in Mexico I can make more money.

EXPANSION OF MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is to express our appreciation for the excellent cover article by Mary 
Anne Perez on the replacement project for the Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center ("Growing Pains," June 12). 
</P>
<P>
 The article accurately portrayed the dilemma faced by those of us responsible 
for inpatient and outpatient care for thousands of residents in the areas 
surrounding the medical center, and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the federal mandate to construct a new hospital or face closure, we must 
proceed with the project to replace our antiquated facilities. This will permit 
us to continue meeting the health needs of our patients for many years to come 
and continue our lengthy traditions of patient care, teaching and research. 
</P>
<P>
 While we deeply regret that some of our friends and neighbors to the east must 
be displaced, we are working diligently to ensure that all of the homeowners, 
tenants and businesses are compensated fairly and relocated appropriately.  
</P>
<P>
 Your readers are invited to direct any questions regarding the project to my 
office, or call project staff at (213) 226-6873.

VOICES: MAKING THE GRADES; CAL STATE L.A.'S ATHLETICS DIRECTOR SAYS THE NEW 
GUIDELINES MAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR MINORITY STUDENTS TO COMPETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carol M. Dunn, 42, is director of athletics at Cal State Los Angeles, a 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II university that fields teams in 
six men's and five women's sports and competes in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. conference. Dunn, formerly the associate athletic director and 
women's basketball coach at Cal State L.A., has been director of athletics 
since 1988 and is the first woman to hold the position in the school's history. 
A former member of the NCAA postgraduate scholarship committee, Dunn now serves 
as president of the CCAA. She was interviewed by Kirby Lee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I firmly believe in emphasizing academics for student-athletes and think the 
NCAA eligibility standards for incoming freshmen set by Proposition 48 are 
excellent ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA's Proposition 48 requires incoming student-athletes to have attained 
a 2.0 grade-point average in high school core classes in addition to meeting 
minimum test scores of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 17 on the 
American College Testing examination. 
</P>
<P>
 I believed in Proposition 48 when it went into effect in 1986 and still do 
today. What we have found through research and history is that Proposition 48 
has helped in the academic success of freshman student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think we need to take a closer look to see if the new standards set 
forth by Proposition 16 are what we want at this point in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 16, which will take effect in the 1995-96 academic year, requires 
a 700 SAT score or 17 ACT score but raises the minimum GPA to 2.5. A student, 
however, who has a GPA as low as 2.0 can offset that with a higher SAT or ACT 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 16 also increases the number of required high school core classes 
from 11 to 13 (core classes, such as English or math, are mandatory for 
graduation from high school). 
</P>
<P>
 Division II schools such as Cal State L.A. and other CCAA schools will be 
exempt from the 2.5 minimum GPA requirement, but we are still bound by the 
increase in core classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Requiring a 700 score on the SAT is absolutely fair and equitable to all. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you start talking about a sliding scale, which Division I schools 
(the NCAA's highest classification, such as UCLA, USC or Cal State Long Beach) 
will have, you need to look more carefully into whether the SAT is a culturally 
biased exam or not. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's fair having student-athletes prepare themselves with the 11 core 
classes in high school but I'm not so sure about requiring 13 classes for them 
to compete as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 It may disenfranchise student-athletes, not only the minorities, but also 
those individuals who just aren't good in math. I think those are the ones it's 
going to hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area I think needs evaluation is monitoring the academic progress of 
student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent NCAA legislation requires student-athletes entering their third year of 
college enrollment to have completed 25% of the course requirements in their 
major. 
</P>
<P>
 But we can't just wait until the junior year and all of a sudden say: "Now 
you're going to be taking all these courses that lead to a degree." It has to 
start as soon as they come in as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 I think a model similar to the one we have at Cal State L.A. should be adopted 
by the NCAA. Our requirements are stricter than NCAA standards and other 
conference schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to student-athletes passing 36 units per year, we require 
two-thirds of the classes to be toward general education or major core courses. 
We also require transfer students to maintain a 2.0 GPA in cumulative work. An 
athlete might be able to compete with a 1.6 cumulative average under NCAA 
rules, but we do not permit that here. 
</P>
<P>
 Our academic support system includes counseling, advisement, tutoring, 
progress checks and monitored study hall for student-athletes. The annual 
retention rate (number of students who stay in school) for our athletes is 84%. 
The team GPA of our athletes rose from 2.56 to 2.74 last year and is higher 
than that of the general student population.  
</P>
<P>
 The budget cuts in the California State University system have been very 
difficult for not just athletics, but all academic areas. We've had to make 
layoffs and other tough decisions. We've had to work harder on fund-raising 
efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite tuition increases, we've dramatically increased our scholarship levels 
as well. For the first time in our history, the men's and women's basketball 
programs will be at the NCAA maximum of 10 full scholarships each. 
</P>
<P>
 I have always believed and supported equitable standards for each gender. I 
can go back to situations coaching at the high school level when the boys' 
teams had practice gear and went on nice road trips and nothing was happening 
on the girls' side. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought the girls should be in good practice gear, too, not because the boys 
had it but because they should be proud of what they do in representing the 
school. By going through established channels and justifying the need for these 
things, I was able to make some positive changes for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tried to carry that way of thinking with me in working with people and 
understanding the real needs of each athletic program -- men's or women's. I 
think that's just plain good and fair leadership whether you're male or female.

REVIVING MEMORIES OF LITERARY WORKSHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am in a rage after reading the self-serving letter of Wanda Coleman (June 
12) concerning the Watts Writers Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 It is well-documented that the workshop was infiltrated by more than one 
agency. (One FBI informant) admittedly was responsible for the fiery 
destruction of the workshop building as well as other community structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Being married to one of the members of the workshop the past 17 years has 
given me the opportunity to know many past members who unquestionably have 
"works of solid literary merit" -- Eric Priestly, poet and author of the novel 
"Raw Dog"; poets K. Curtis Lyle, Kamau Daa-ood, Ojenke; Quincy Troupe, 
co-author of the Miles Davis biography "Miles," and the Watts Prophets.

DONS HOPE IT'S SUMMER RERUN TIME; WATTS GAMES: STRONG POINT-GUARD PLAY HAS BEEN 
THE STAPLE OF DORSEY'S OFFENSE. MEANWHILE, VERBUM DEI FEELS THE LOSS OF MILLER 
AND COBBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH and WILL ETHERIDGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dorsey Dons boys' basketball team is hoping to repeat its success of two 
years ago in this year's Watts Summer Games basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey won the boys' basketball championship in 1992 and finished as City 
Section 4-A Division runners-up in '92 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, seeded second behind last year's champion Compton Dominguez, easily 
disposed of Covina, Agoura and Westlake in the June 18 opening rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kenya Wilkins and then Terrell McKnight running the show for the past two 
years, strong point-guard play has been the staple of Dorsey's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 This season looks to be no different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mack West played surprisingly well (at point guard) over the three games," 
Dorsey coach Kevin Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be responsible for getting our big guns (Charles Johnson, Willie 
ONeal and Jason Howzell) the ball in scoring position." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey advanced to play in yesterday's second-round games at Washington High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei's showing in its first two games of the Watts Summer Games has not 
been to Coach Mike Kearney's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, Southern Section Division IV champions, split its first set of 
games, defeating South Gate, then losing to Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our half-court offense needs some work," Kearney said. "We are trying to play 
the same style of basketball as last year but it's not easy without Andre 
(Miller) and Jamal (Cobbs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei enjoyed one of its most successful seasons in school history last 
year, winning 26 of 29 games, advancing to the Southern Regional Division IV 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles employed a tenacious full-court press, which led to numerous 
fast-break opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the absence of Miller, who will play at the University of Utah 
this fall, and Cobbs, Kearney will have to deviate somewhat from last year's 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more emphasis on the big guys, Andre Larry and Andre Smith," 
Kearney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our inside play will contribute more to our overall scoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei begins play in the Artesia tournament Monday at Artesia High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Watts Summer Games have reaffirmed two things Jordan Coach Ed Kamiyama 
already knew about his team. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the players he has nicknamed the Bionic Four -- Clem Breedlove, Termell 
Goss, Carlos Cabada and Julio Medrano -- will have no problem with offensive 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the team will have big troubles against big teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan won a first-round game against San Pedro but lost to a larger 
Washington Generals team in its second contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are competitive for a while, but in the latter stages of the game, size 
begins to wear us down and eventually take over," Kamiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamiyama's tallest player on the roster is 6-1 Jose Sanchez, who did not play 
for the Bulldogs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he is also expecting 6-2 freshman Roylee Myers to try out for the 
team come August. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kamiyama: "There aren't a lot of 5-10 teams out there, so (Sanchez and 
Myers) will give us much needed help inside and on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Compton College, four Central City teams advanced to last Sunday's third 
round of the Watts Summer Games flag-football tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson, Los Angeles, Loyola and Verbum Dei all survived first-round play on 
June 18, but only Loyola -- a Southern Section Division I quarterfinalist last 
season -- was able to advance to the Games' afternoon quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, however, lost 19-18 to Long Beach Poly -- a Southern Section 
Division I quarterfinalist last season. Jefferson beat Torrance and Crenshaw 
but later lost to Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles likewise defeated its first two opponents -- Inglewood Morningside 
and San Pedro (last year's City 3-A champion) -- before being blanked by 
Newhall Hart, 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei wide receiver Damion Wright caught a tipped ball and ran it in for 
the tying score on the last play of the game against Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 On the extra-point attempt, converted running back Corey Redeaux found tight 
end Frank Harris wide open over the middle for the winning score in the Eagles' 
8-6 upset of Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other action: Fremont used a passing game in beating Los Angeles Murphy, 
13-7, with new junior quarterback Robert Loera (William Yates' understudy last 
season). 
</P>
<P>
 In Locke's 37-0 defeat of Burbank Burroughs, Hassan Bailey (former Saints' 
quarterback Akili Roberson's replacement and a starter at wide receiver last 
season) tossed five touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Sirr Parker, a 1994 City Times second team all-star, had three 
touchdown receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey is set at the skill positions with the return of quarterback Roderick 
Brown and running back Antwain Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Lineman Anthony Tinsley, David Genyard and linebacker Darius Webster all 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts' quarterback William Laffitte, brother of Deon Laffitte, completed 
15 of 18 passes with three touchdowns in a 27-19 win over Culver City.

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; AT 24, THE WORLD IS OPEN TO ELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whither Ernie? We probably will be seeing a lot more of the new U.S. Open 
champion, headed for greatness in the opinion of Jack Nicklaus and others who 
say they know a phenom when they see one drive the green and curl in nasty 
35-footers. 
</P>
<P>
 Els, of South Africa, said he plans to play 15 PGA Tour events next year, 
which would have been the minimum for keeping his card if he hadn't earned a 
10-year exemption by winning the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I will play a lot more tournaments (in the United States)," Els said. 
"But I will always play around the world, I think. For the time being, I am 
still pretty young and I can travel around. I will play Europe, I will play 
America, I will play Japan, I will play all over the place. But I will play a 
lot more in America, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably a good idea. In seven events on the PGA Tour this year, Els 
has collected $529,130. He has made the cut six times and has three top-10 
finishes -- first in the U.S. Open, second at the Buick Classic and tied for 
eighth at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the PGA European Tour, he is third on the money list, trailing only Masters 
champion Jose Maria Olazabal and U.S. Open co-runner-up Colin Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Els has moved from 11th place to No. 7 in the SONY rankings, passing Paul 
Azinger, David Frost, Ian Woosnam and Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as things have been going for him, Els said he isn't going to change. 
He has earned a reputation as an affable, gum-chewing, big-money player with 
strength and finesse, not at all a bad combination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Els: Maybe we should have seen him coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he achieved the first hat-trick of the South African Open, PGA and 
Masters since Gary Player in 1979. Player was 43 when he did it. Els was 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Player sent a note to Els the morning of the playoff and Els found it hanging 
in his locker at Oakmont. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add Els: Loren Roberts, who lost to Els in a sudden-death playoff for the 
Open title, said that at 38, he envies the 24-year-old Els' game.  
</P>
<P>
 So what was Roberts doing at 24? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an an assistant pro working at Morro Bay, giving lessons, renting 
carts, selling green fees and making pimiento cheese sandwiches and hot dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy: Even though he shot a four-round total of 299 and finished in a tie for 
58th at the U.S. Open, Fuzzy Zoeller maintained his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played ugly golf, but I almost broke 300, so I must be better than a 
bowler," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Johnny: Johnny Miller, who has won 24 tournaments, is wondering why 
only one player, Nick Price, has won more than once this year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty amazing, isn't it?" Miller said. "I wish there was a way of 
getting inside all these players' heads and seeing how much they really play to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have players that obviously always want to win, but there was a time . . . 
Nicklaus would be first to admit that the whole focus of the week was to get 
rested up enough or prepared enough -- like Hogan did -- that you would go win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it is more go through the motions of doing all the things you are 
supposed to do with the hopes of maybe it might be your week once a year or 
twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's being realistic for the players, because there is (sic) so many 
good players now. But I can't believe that you don't get more multiple winners, 
especially out of the talents of a (Fred) Couples, (Greg) Norman. Price is the 
first double winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I think Norman is going to win, four, five, six, seven events a year. He 
has the ability. So does Price. Somebody could break out this summer, starting 
right about now. Price can still have a monster year if he finished it off 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: For what it's worth, Golf Digest predicts that Price will win the British 
Open. Golf Digest also said the favorite at the U.S. Open  
</P>
<P>
 was Nick Faldo, who missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Domination: If they were 22 instead of 54 and 64, would Jack Nicklaus and 
Arnold Palmer dominate golf today? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any player who has been dominant in his time would be dominant today," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you brought Byron Nelsons, Ben Hogans, if you brought Bobby Joneses, 
Walter Hagens, I think all these players would have been dominant players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly think Arnie and I would probably fall in the same category." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps next? For the golfer who has everything, a Scottsdale company has come 
up with "golf paper," which is paper made of traditional pulp, plus actual 
grass clippings from greens. 
</P>
<P>
 The clippings are treated and blended into the paper, which is made of 
recycled material. Golf Notes

U.S. TEAM GAINS SUPPORT AS IT GOES ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHNETTE HOWARD, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They knew the pollster's dreary findings and the long odds against them 
knocking off heavily favored Colombia. But the American soccer team also knew 
it needed a spark, something akin to sending a bottle rocket screeching across 
the sky, something that would force folks across the country not just to pay 
half-hearted attention to them, but smile and marvel -- maybe even get a little 
dewy-eyed at what they had done. What they desperately needed, in midfielder 
John Harkes's words, was "a result that shocked the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And they pulled it off Wednesday on a beautiful California day at the Rose 
Bowl with a stunning 2-1 victory that, in part, persuaded Colombian Coach 
Francisco Manturana to announce he would resign. Now, the fervent hope among 
the players and U.S. soccer officials is that this tournament run might do for 
American soccer what the pioneering "Miracle on Ice" victory over the Soviet 
Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y., did for U.S. ice hockey 
-- or, failing that, at least mirror what skier Tommy Moe's stunning victory in 
the Lillehammer Olympic downhill race last February did to snowball interest in 
the U.S. Winter Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 All three instances are the kind of sports victories that Americans -- 
delusionally or not -- like to think of as quintessentially American. The U.S. 
soccer players, to a man, said they all believed they could defeat Colombia 
even before the game began. That took a ton of bravado. The Americans also knew 
they commanded scant respect not just at home, but also abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people had looked at the roster and derided it as a "passport" or 
"green-card team" -- a motley mix of naturalized U.S. citizens, college stars 
and overseas-based pros. Some questioned if the squad would have qualified for 
the Cup if it hadn't gotten the host's bye into the 24-team field. That 
motivated the U.S. team too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the American team -- which went from January to April without a win in 
international tune-up play -- finds itself in a wholly unexpected tie for first 
place in its four-team World Cup group. Sunday's first-round finale against 
Romania at the Rose Bowl figures to be the most-watched soccer game in U.S. 
history. Depending on the score, a win could send the U.S. team to Washington, 
D.C., for its second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the other first-place teams in each group, "We don't have a 
(world-class star) Hagi or a Valderramma," says U.S. assistant coach Sigi 
Schmid of the Romanian and Colombian stand-outs. "We know that our success 
comes from unity and from helping each other out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a hard way to play. But then the team is full of men used to hard knocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither flamboyant defender Alexi Lalas and midfielder Cobi Jones, one of the 
first subs off the bench, received college scholarships; they made their 
college teams by showing up and trying out. Another starting U.S. defender, Cle 
Kooiman, received no response from 1990 World Cup coach Bob Gansler when he 
sent Gansler videotapes of his Mexican League games. "I thought I should've got 
at least a one-game look," said Kooiman, who kicked a 59-yard field goal as a 
high school football player but turned down scholarship offers from USC and 
others because, "My heart was in soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Hugo Perez's family sneaked into the United States from El Salvador 
when he was a child; Fernando Clavijo, his wife and two children moved to the 
United States as illegal aliens in the mid-1980s. He bussed tables and cleaned 
factory floors around New York City to make ends meet until his indoor soccer 
career took off. In 1987, he obtained his U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Striker Roy Wegerle was born in South Africa and left home at age 17 after a 
successful letter-writing campaign to U.S. colleges gleaned one -- the 
University of South Florida -- that would take him. Had Wegerle stayed, the 
country's apartheid policies would've frozen him out of international sport. As 
it was, he nearly missed this World Cup because he underwent three arthroscopic 
knee surgeries on Jan. 18, March 30 and April 15 of this year. Almost 
concurrently, starting sweeper Marcelo Balboa raced back from a disastrous 
anterior cruciate knee ligament tear in 7 1/2 months -- far faster than the 
usual 9- to 12-month recovery period. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa, playing with abandon Wednesday against Colombia, almost scored on a 
bicycle kick shot that missed the net so narrowly Meola was seen crossing 
himself in amazement at the other end of the field. (To execute a bicycle kick, 
the most difficult goal-scoring maneuver, the player falls backward, 
scissor-kicks the ball and lands on his upper back.) 
</P>
<P>
 "If Marcelo had scored on that play it would've been the greatest goal in the 
World Cup history, in my opinion," Meola said. "A play like that takes 
incredible timing, skill. Everything. And he was so close. Man!" 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, two goals against Colombia were enough. Afterward many of 
the U.S. players admitted having to choke back tears as they celebrated on the 
field. So many of them-Harkes, Ernie Stewart, Tab Ramos, Eric Wynalda, Wegerle 
and Kooiman-were the first Americans to excel in their respective overseas 
leagues. Another, Thomas Dooley, was born in Germany to a German mother and a 
U.S. serviceman who abandoned them. Though reared there, Dooley says he also 
craved coming to the United States, trying to find his father. When the U.S. 
team called in 1992, he packed up his family and left Germany's prestigious 
Bundesliga to make the 16-month training buildup with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley has often said when he arrived, " "Cheesburger, please' were the only 
English words I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow they got by. Somehow they got to this point, all of them assembled by 
cagey coach Bora Milutinovic, who may be the most charmed man in international 
soccer today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three World Cups, the Serbian-born Milutinovic has taken an 
unheralded Mexican team to the World Cup quarterfinal rounds in 1986 (Mexico's 
best-ever result), an even less-respected Costa Rican team to the second round 
of the 1990 World Cup. Milutinovic's coaching background against Latin teams -- 
and a hunch to start 37-year-old Clavijo -- proved a decisive advantage against 
Colombia. The American team had an answer for every maneuver the Colombians 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World Cup play began on June 17, nearly 75 percent of Americans polled 
didn't know it was coming to the United States. That number has nearly 
flip-flopped now -- 60 percent of people in most recent poll have noticed the 
quadrennial world championship is here for the first time. If the American team 
keeps going like this, the number figures to leap again. But don't tell them 
it's a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that," Lalas says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A miracle -- aw, I don't know," defender Paul Caligiuri says. "I've heard 
that we seem fearless a few times now, and I think that's a good assessment. 
The fashion we played (Wednesday) and the result really inspired us. There's 
this great World Cup atmosphere once we get on the field, and once you see a 
great slide tackle to knock the ball away or a great save by Tony, you just 
want to step up too. No one on this team wants to let the other guys down. Bora 
is pioneering this thing, giving us his experience. And he just keeps 
reiterating the importance of going out there and enjoying the game -- just 
enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's only been two games. But what's not to enjoy?

CHECK CARDS CATCHING ON WITH BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For business travelers wary about hitting the road with a stash of cash, 
there's an increasingly popular alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the individual checking account, made portable by so-called "check cards" 
that allow users to buy electronically, anywhere, anytime, with their own funds 
but without having to write an actual check. 
</P>
<P>
 Debit cards have been around for some time, primarily used for getting cash 
from automated teller machines. But, according to Linda Baker, a senior vice 
president at Visa International, using them to pay for purchases directly from 
checking accounts is becoming more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there were 15.1 million cards usable on the Visa system for checking 
account withdrawals. They look like any other bank credit card, and the 
merchant handling the transaction doesn't know the payment is coming from a 
checking account instead of being charged to a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 All it takes is a swipe of the card for the merchant to get approval for the 
purchase. In Visa's case, that's at 12 million locations in more than 200 
countries, the same locations where the Visa charge card is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Visa, which is an association of about 19,000 banks around the world, is the 
predominant player in the check card field. Its major competitor is MasterCard 
with about 5 million check cards in use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merchants see this as a real advantage," Baker said. "If they take a check 
card, it brings in more customers. People don't want to carry a lot of cash. 
And it brings the vendor the safety of not having to take bank checks, since 
every transaction is authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Business travelers may find check cards a convenient way to separate business 
from personal purchases -- using a check card, for example, for personal items 
while charging corporate expenses on a standard credit card.

 When traveling overseas, she said, a check card "gets you the . . . benefit of 
a wholesale exchange rate."

 But statistics show that Americans overwhelmingly prefer to pay in cash. Of 
the approximately 103 billion consumer purchases done at the point of sale in 
the United States last year, 70% were in cash.

ARRESTING EMPLOYEES CAN BE TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening the door to police who are seeking an employee accused of a crime 
outside the office sometimes allows in not only law and order, but trouble as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Two authorities on workplace law say that permitting the police to enter may 
not always be the wisest course of action because if there is a false arrest or 
an injury, the employer could be held liable. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if the police enter and make a false arrest with the employer's 
participation, or with the aid of a company security guard, "the employer could 
be implicated in a false-arrest situation," say attorneys Thomas Greble and Lee 
Boyd, of the New York law firm of Roberts & Finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials should contact legal counsel before giving police the green 
light to enter, the attorneys add. However, if police have a valid search 
warrant, an employer is required to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Greble and Boyd were asked to comment on an actual arrest case that turned 
sour when a worker wanted for non-payment of child support happened to have a 
black belt in karate. In the arrest, he mauled police officers and security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee broke one arresting officer's leg with a karate kick and threw 
the company's security chief through a door, all in front of shocked 
co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, cited in the book "Sex, Laws & Stereotypes" by N. Elizabeth Fried, 
(Intermediaries Press, Dublin, Ohio) suggests the need for company discretion 
in workplace arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of exposing co-workers to potential harm, it would have been wiser in 
this case to suggest to police that they serve their warrant "away from work," 
the expert panel concluded.

PARTNERS CONTINUE POOLING RESOURCES; SWIM TEAM AND MISSION VIEJO RESIDENTS WILL 
BOTH BENEFIT UNDER NEW AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coach of the Mission Viejo Nadadores swim team once proclaimed that the 
swimmers put the community on the map. He was not boasting, just stating the 
facts as he saw them, and there is ample evidence that he was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the team's history, and because it continued to be an asset to the 
city, it was important that the Mission Viejo City Council and the Nadadores 
ended two years of tense negotiations successfully this month and kept the 
swimmers in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The team started in 1968 as a small swim club when three dozen parents 
persuaded the community's developer, the Mission Viejo Co., to hire a coach. 
The company was happy to oblige and quickly recognized the importance of a 
world-class operation to marketing the red-roofed homes it was building. Over 
the years, Nadadores swimmers won 40 medals in the Olympic Games, and the name 
Mission Viejo became internationally known. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mission Viejo became a city in 1988, and the Mission Viejo Co. ended its 
sponsorship of the Nadadores. The company traded its pool complex and other 
recreation centers to the city in exchange for an office building in 1991. That 
meant that as the recession picked up steam, the city was left with a $265,000 
bill for annual maintenance of the swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some grumbled that the pool served too few community residents for the cost. 
But parents of swimmers wisely pitched in, helping with fund-raising and 
maintenance. To close the deal for a long-term lease, with renegotiation 
possible in three years, the team agreed to continue paying $14,400 a year for 
pool rental and to allow greater use by non-members. The city agreed to pay for 
upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 The pools are a good magnet for Mission Viejo's residents, especially 
youngsters who need recreational facilities. And the team helps reinforce the 
identity of a young city, promoting a good image of the community.

REMARKABLE SESSION ON CURING CITY'S ILLS; INTERFAITH GROUP HAS GOOD IDEAS TO 
STEM ANAHEIM VIOLENCE, IF MONEY CAN BE FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of people from an interfaith group gathered at St. Boniface Catholic 
Church in Anaheim last week to present a laundry list of requests to Mayor Tom 
Daly. The hope is to stem the tide of violence in the city by implementing a 
plan of action for young people, a very worthy goal indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, of course, with this and any crying community need is likely to 
be money. Daly listened patiently to the requests for the creation of a teen 
center, a computer lab, the expansion of youth programs at the George 
Washington Community Center, the expansion of the city's summer jobs program 
and other good ideas. Then he advised the enthusiastic audience from the Orange 
County Congregation Community Organization that their ideas necessarily were 
competing with others for a share of the city pie, and he urged residents to 
make their priorities heard before the City Council on Tuesday night sessions 
so that they could get in on the ground floor of the planning. But he did 
commit to helping implement the organization's goals, however they might be 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The session was remarkable on a number of levels. This and other efforts in 
Santa Ana by the same interfaith group constitute a significant grass-roots 
effort by mainstream people of religious faith in Orange County. They want to 
mobilize their values toward shaping public policy and to improve a society 
racked by well-documented ills. These are not the flag-waving, ideologically 
intransigent members of the Religious Right. They are people who marched to the 
microphone to give testimony of drive-by shootings on their own streets and to 
express the urgency they feel to begin transforming a shattered world. If these 
people do not always approach the budget with a great deal of sophistication 
about the process, they make up for that easily by bringing a wellspring of 
hope and enthusiasm to an array of vexing problems that may actually seem 
insolvable. 
</P>
<P>
 One fresh idea brought to the table by the group, for example, was that 
children might get discounts on parks and recreation fees by doing community 
work, a kind of "sweat equity." In a time of competing budget needs, these 
folks bring needed volunteers to get things done. And in the process, they may 
be transforming relationships between government providers of services and 
constituents in some small but meaningful way, to bring government at the local 
level into partnership with them, even as government serves as a facilitator.

CUTTING SENIORS' LINK TO OUTSIDE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * For our aging, few conditions are more debilitating than the depression 
brought on by isolation. Senior center lunch programs, community sponsored 
excursions, multi-generational outreach activities all attempt to address what 
is generally acknowledged as a horrendous, life-shortening state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, few living situations are more empowering than the ability 
to adequately manage living alone.  
</P>
<P>
 For many seniors the balance between these two, isolation and independence, is 
tenuous, at best. Getting to the bank, grocery store, post office, an 
occasional movie or lunch with a friend often means the difference between 
going on or giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the ability to get out and participate is not always limited by a 
disabling physical condition, but by a situational one: the lack of appropriate 
transportation. Not everyone is lucky enough to have family and or friends who 
can play the chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, in Orange County, Dial-a-Ride has stepped in and eased the stress 
of that immobility. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Orange County Transportation Authority has decided to discontinue 
that service. In a move, claiming to accede to the demands of the ADA 
(Americans With Disabilities Act), OCTA appears to have pitted the urgent needs 
of the frail elderly against those of the disabled and, as in the past, the 
result is what will undoubtedly be horribly traumatic for many seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 For many who lose their access to the outside world, their key to independence 
and the freedom it ensures, it will necessitate entering custodial care.

HARBOR PARKING GATES SPARK BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I recently read the terrible news on the economic downfall that the Dana 
Point Harbor stores and restaurants have been experiencing since they installed 
the parking gates. I love it! I have lived in that area for over 20 years and 
was furious when they installed the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided I would not buy a thing from any of the stores or restaurants that 
are within the harbor area. It would be my own personal boycott, but after 
reading the article, it seems a lot of people have the same idea. I still go to 
the harbor but park somewhere else. Again, I will not buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
 I would suggest the merchants get together real quickly and correct this 
situation before (they) have a lot of going-out-of-business sales.

CONTROVERSY IN RECALL AFTERMATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is not surprising that W. Snow Hume (Letters, June 19) objects to The 
Times publishing the commentary by Prof. Vince Buck on Fullerton's recall 
election. Throughout the recall campaign, Mr. Hume complained whenever other 
newspapers published letters and articles that were not favorable to his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 His objection to The Times' publishing of Prof. Buck's article is that "the 
ordinary reader would guess that the column is an objective analysis. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Rubbish! Readers of The Times are well aware that the page opposite the 
editorial page is reserved for a variety of opinions. In fact, lest there be 
any doubt, the page is plainly labeled, in very bold type, "Commentary." 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders if Mr. Hume's dedication to the First Amendment is as strong as 
that of Justice Hugo Black, who observed: "An unconditional right to say what 
one pleases about public affairs is what I consider to be the minimum guarantee 
of the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 G.J. BROWN 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton's recalled City Council members may get yet another chance to try 
to subvert the will of the people. Those council members' first chance occurred 
when they couldn't (persuade) 13,500 Fullerton voters not to sign the recall 
petitions and had to schedule a recall election. They lost again when more than 
9,000 voters said "yes" to recall. Most of these city council members were 
elected with less than 6,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they want another chance! They haven't stepped down, it's business as 
usual. This time they want to delay the recall election until the November 
general election. They will tell you it's to save the cost of a special 
election, but they could have done that by resigning when they saw the 13,500 
petition signatures (last) February. Could it be because they want to continue 
in office and ask the voters to again elect them or their allies in November? 
But this time it's in a complex general election where there are many issues 
and candidates for high office on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess they hope that a lot of people who are mostly concerned with voting 
for the governor, senator and other high profile issues and candidates will 
just vote for the incumbents for the city offices. 
</P>
<P>
 A third chance might change what you attended City Council meetings for in the 
summer of 1993, what you signed petitions for near year-end, and what you voted 
for in June, 1994. Remember, when you or your friends get fired, there's never 
a second chance and certainly never a third!

DISRUPTIVE CHILDREN NEED EDUCATION TOO; BUT EXPERTS' JUDGMENT SHOULD GET FIRST 
CONSIDERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the halls of Congress, where the laws originated, to the corridors of 
Orange County schools, where they are carried out, there is agreement that 
children with disabilities are entitled to be educated in regular classrooms, 
along with children without disabilities, as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It means students should not be shunted off to segregated classrooms because 
they are "different." Experts say that in regular classes, those with special 
needs get a chance to see how other students act and to use them as role 
models. So far, so good. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem comes when one student so disrupts a class as to deprive other 
children of their right to learn. Then the rights of the individual must be 
balanced against those of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Circle View Elementary School in Huntington Beach argued last 
month that 6-year-old Jimmy Peters should be moved from regular classes to a 
special-education program because, they said, he hit other students. His father 
said the child was not violent or a danger to other students and deserved to 
stay in the regular class. The matter quickly went to the courts -- too quickly 
-- and the father won; the boy was ordered returned to class. A subsequent 
agreement will have the boy receiving special-education classes this summer, 
which is good. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem of how best to obey the law on serving special-education 
students without interfering with other students is complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, there are 5 million special-education students. Orange 
County has more than 36,000, or nearly 9% of its total student enrollment. Most 
schools appear to be doing as much as possible to include special-education 
students in regular classes. Parents usually have agreed on reassignments 
recommended by educators whose training in serving the disabled should make 
them the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, given an increase in the number of objections and court cases, school 
administrators are rightly worried that they may find themselves spending too 
much time in court. Legal battles are expensive and of less help to a child 
deserving the best education possible than are productive discussions between 
educators and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 When parents and teachers disagree, Congress should give more leeway to 
schools seeking to remove students considered a threat to others. While pupils 
considered disruptive can be reassigned to special-education classes 
temporarily under current law, the schools should be allowed to make the 
assignment longer. That will allow time for hearings and another chance at 
getting a parent who may be in denial to understand that a youngster really can 
benefit most from special attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining that a special-education youngster is too disruptive to have in a 
class is not and must not amount to the same thing as to accuse him or her of 
wrongdoing. The reality is that putting a child in a regular class is the 
ideal, but there are times when it cannot be done. Parents do have appeal 
panels and, as a last resort, courts to protect their children's interests in 
the event of flawed assessments or outright discrimination. But the teachers 
and school officials are the professionals whose judgments ought to be given 
great weight at the outset, pending administrative or judicial resolution. It 
doesn't seem to be working that way now, as the impasse in the Huntington Beach 
case suggested, regardless of whoever ultimately was right or wrong in that 
instance. Allowing the educators to make judgments is part of the reason we 
entrust our children to them in the first place.

GRADE ALTERING HAS RAMIFICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If anyone wants a good example of why education is in dire trouble, one can 
find it with the grade altering at Brea Olinda High School ("Brea Academic 
Counselors Altered Grades," June 16). 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have announced that counselors had changed grades in 70 
instances in the last 10 years so that some seniors could have better grade 
averages for college entrance. The "big lie" is now a monster that eats into 
the good reputation that Brea Olinda High School long enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. (Edgar Z.) Seal called it "a judgment error." The educational code was 
violated and that is breaking the law! Brea Olinda needs a housecleaning, not a 
hand slapping. This so-called "poor judgment" breaks the faith that parents and 
students expect in the administration of the school they attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Hypocrisy has no place in education. 
</P>
<P>
 LOUISE BOOTH 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 * It seems we found one of the reasons today's schoolchildren lie and cheat. 
They are doing the same thing the school's academic counselors do. At Brea 
Olinda High School it seems it has been a common practice for academic 
counselors to switch grades in order to allow students to enter colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 This we are now told is both illegal and unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very serious when one school administrator lies and cheats. When a group 
of them decide they are above the law it becomes a different matter. What do we 
expect of students who see their grades are switched by school officials, and 
nothing is done to these officials. We are told no disciplinary action is 
planned against these school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we not reinforcing the idea that it is all right to lie and cheat, because 
if you do, nothing will happen? Are we also teaching that it is all right to 
break the law? We cannot say that these counselors had good intentions, 
(because) if the students were not qualified to enter college are they not 
being set up for failure at the university level? 
</P>
<P>
 I do hope that both the school trustees and the teachers' union press for 
justice, not only in the future, but in the past as well. Our students must 
learn that crime does not pay, by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES MONTERO 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Thanks for your "perspective" on "How Not to Make the Grade" (Editorial, 
June 17). 
</P>
<P>
 The message to the students of Brea Olinda High School from their counselors 
and Supt. Seal is: It's OK to cheat and break the law and don't worry if you do 
get caught -- plead "bad judgment" and you will not be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 No question about it, the counselors and superintendent get an F and should be 
looking for honest work elsewhere.

MOMMY TRACKERS SHOULD COVER TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Rita Redaelli, executive director of Girls Inc. of Orange County, is calling 
fathers on Father's Day to dismantle barriers that limit girls' opportunities 
("Dismantling Barriers That Limit Girls' Opportunities, Success," June 19). 
While I agree with the call, I strongly believe that she is addressing the 
wrong gender, We, career women of the '90s, must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 My anger and call are directed to those of us that have climbed up the 
corporate ladder and are now chopping off the steps. A new growing trend is 
taking place among my colleagues of the weak gender. Professional women in the 
midst of their career are leaving promising positions in big corporations with 
the official reason "leaving to become a full-time mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a mother of three children myself, I can certainly sympathize with the 
idea. However, I feel that it causes considerable damage to career women 
struggling for recognition in the "equal" business world of men. How can I 
expect my employer to invest money and time in training, developing and 
furthering my position in the company while my colleagues are catching the 
"mother syndrome?" 
</P>
<P>
 I oppose the stated reason that leads to further stereotyping of the gender. I 
suggest using excuses like "leaving due to personal reasons" or even the noble 
one, "to take on new endeavors."

TRAVEL KEEPS VECTOR CONTROL UP TO DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I serve on the board of trustees of the Orange County Vector Control 
District and am proud of it. I am chairman of the policy committee that revised 
our travel policy, which was the topic and concern of an article 
("Pest-Fighting District Limits Staff Travel," June 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Our travel is for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 We buy our insurance from a joint powers agency formed by many vector control 
districts in the state. In three years, we have saved $100,000 on premiums. We 
pay for our manager to attend these meetings -- well worth the cost. Our 
technical staff is licensed. They must continue education to maintain their 
licenses. We pay travel and registration fees to attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
 We employ several scientists and we pay for the cost and travel to and from 
seminars and workshops. Scientific progress depends on the free flow of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 We upgrade the computer skills of our secretarial staff. 
</P>
<P>
 We do have a very large board of trustees. Every city in Orange County is 
represented, plus the county of Orange. As we have added several new cities to 
the list in the past few years, we decided we had to put a limit on the 
trustees who attend the once-a-year meeting of the California Mosquito and 
Vector Control Assn. In the process, we reviewed our whole travel policy. We 
are currently discussing all policies for the district and considering whether 
we should have policies where none existed before. 
</P>
<P>
 I am proud of the district. We provide an efficient and vital public health 
service. Our enthusiastic staff delivers necessary service for a fee of 
somewhere between $1.50 and $3.19 per parcel, per year. What a bargain.

TO HALT TOLLWAY, APATHY MUST STOP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was one of the protesters who was at the grading site for the San Joaquin 
Hills tollway June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 While driving by, I saw protesters and decided to stop and help, as did a few 
other motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to me that the majority of drivers going by that day were giving us 
thumbs up and nods of approval; however, they were not stopping to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Public apathy about this project has got to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Other large projects, such as the Embarcadero Freeway in San Francisco, were 
stopped after the concrete had already been poured, but it took people doing 
something active about it to get that freeway project halted. 
</P>
<P>
 If the UC regents can legally sell an ecological preserve to the developers of 
the toll road, then it seems that a future City Council of Laguna Beach could 
sell the newly acquired Laguna Canyon Parklands back to the developers so that 
we will not just have the toll road running through the canyon -- more housing 
tracts and shopping malls are the ultimate goal of Orange County developers.

PUBLIC NEEDS A SAY ON AIRPORT, BUT ITS PRICE TAG MAY BE A SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The initiative to convert the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a 
commercial airport will be on the November ballot for all of the Orange County 
voters to decide ("113,000 Signatures Back El Toro Airport Vote," June 2). 
Opponents to this initiative declare that this issue should not be decided by 
the public but rather by county planning commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I believe that the public should have a voice in this matter because 
this is a critical issue that will affect all of us in Orange County for years. 
We must look ahead 20 or more years, when the Irvine Ranch and other nearby 
undeveloped areas are fully developed with homes, apartments, condos, motels, 
hotels, recreation facilities, and all kinds of businesses. There will be a 
huge demand for airport services. John Wayne Airport will not be able to meet 
these demands. We will need another local airport. Where will it be? Before El 
Toro became available, no one could find suitable locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro base is now available with a ready-made airfield. As a taxpayer, I 
have already paid to have this airfield built at El Toro. I do not want my tax 
money wasted. El Toro can be modified for use as a commercial airport at a cost 
that is far less than what a new airport would cost. We cannot leave this 
decision to planning committees that are stacked with representatives from 
nearby cities who have their own particular interests in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a commercial airport at El Toro would use less than one half of the base 
area, many other developments can also be proposed, which the planning 
committees can work on and resolve. We need the democratic process to resolve 
this critical airport matter. I am very pleased that I can vote on this 
important issue. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The article, "Voters to Have Say on El Toro" (June 22), sheds some light on 
the important issue of El Toro's future. 
</P>
<P>
 As a mere Orange County resident with no perceptible ax to grind, I'd like to 
see El Toro become a commercial airport. There's long been talk of a need for 
an international airport. Maybe here's an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 One question is "What will be the relationship of El Toro to John Wayne?" Will 
John Wayne stay the same, decrease to only commuter and small-plane status 
(after all the money spent on roads, posh terminals and parking structures) or 
allowed to grow, too? 
</P>
<P>
 I'd guess developers and South County homeowners would like to see El Toro 
become houses, each for their own reasons. Homeowners around John Wayne Airport 
would like to see El Toro prosper and reduce some of John Wayne's traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Orange County need in addition to a larger airport? It needs a jail 
site, low-cost housing (modified barracks?), and recreational/park space. 
Here's an opportunity to get all three in one fell swoop. I feel the voters 
would be shortsighted to side with a few homeowners or developers and cheat 
themselves out of a great opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 JACK AND VIRGINIA THEIBERT

</P>
<P>
 * In November voters will be asked to approve or disapprove an initiative to 
develop an all-day/all-night commercial airport as a reuse of the Marine Corps 
Air Station at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 We have been told that a "yes" vote means thousands of new jobs for Orange 
County. What we haven't been told is that this initiative socks us with a price 
tag of a $1-billion bond issue! 
</P>
<P>
 So think twice, taxpayers. Approval will not only damage our environment and 
quality of life, but it will heavily impact our pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are better ways! 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * A recent issue of your paper contained three letters opposing both the El 
Toro Marine base as a commercial airport and the countywide petition to vote on 
this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not surprising that all three were from residents of Irvine and Laguna 
Hills. They are, of course, biased and state some erroneous facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The base was there as an airport long before most of the residents now 
opposing a commercial airport moved into its vicinity. They should not now 
complain. Incidentally, commercial aircraft are much quieter than most military 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
 An airport would be a financial boon for the whole county, the third largest 
in population in California and expected to increase by almost another 400,000 
by 2003.

VOLUNTEERS CAN HELP PREVENT CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Abused Children Staying Longer in O.C. Shelter," (June 21) eloquently 
pointed out the critical problem of child abuse in Orange County. As Supervisor 
(William G.) Steiner said, there is no single answer to this complex 
problem.However, one promising solution is a concerted effort to prevent the 
problem from occurring or recurring once it is identified. 
</P>
<P>
 We have heard child-abuse statistics so often that perhaps we are numb to the 
human tragedy and astronomical costs the cold numbers suggest. But for those 
whose hearts are stirred by this issue and wish to make a difference, many 
volunteer opportunities exist. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, the Exchange Club Child Abuse Prevention Center has matched 
trained volunteers with families who are struggling with abusive tendencies. 
Dedicated volunteers work with a family for one year teaching parenting and 
communication skills and problem-solving techniques. They break the abuse cycle 
and help families live together in a nonviolent home.

VIETNAMESE VIEWS IN POLL MISINTERPRETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * While I commend the Los Angeles Times for its effort to conduct a survey on 
critical issues concerning the Vietnamese community, I think that these 
articles ("Southland Vietnamese Support Renewed Ties," June 12 and "Vietnamese 
Political Passions Have Cooled," June 13) poorly serve readers because they 
misinterpret the poll results. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who supported the method of applying pressures on the Vietnam 
government to obtain democracy are those who preferred a diplomatic approach to 
the problem; however, they are not supporters of the current government. The 
bottom line is that 68% of (those in) the survey preferred a change in the 
Vietnam political system. This result is consistent with the 59% unfavorable 
rating on the Communist government of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese are practical people. They accepted the past, for they realized 
that history cannot be altered. However, they did not forget the terrible 
wrongs that the Communist Party did to our country. The majority of the 
Vietnamese community in Southern California did not make peace with the past 
nor with the Communist government of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article claimed that "the voices of the protest were silent on the very 
day that President Clinton lifted the embargo." This statement is a disregard 
of the truth. Your newspaper reported in the Feb. 6, 1994, edition that 600 
people attended a rally held in Little Saigon the previous day to protest the 
lifting of the embargo against Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim that "the passionate rhetoric of Little Saigon protesters and 
demonstrators is clearly at odds with the moderate views of the majority of 
Vietnamese immigrants" showed The Times Poll staff's lack of understanding 
about the depth and the psychology of the Vietnamese community. Nothing could 
be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 12 months, the political rallies and demonstrations in Little 
Saigon broke many previous attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
 It is absolutely essential to point out that the poll was conducted two months 
after the lifting of the embargo. The time element is critical in every survey. 
Unfortunately, there was no question that addressed the change in attitude 
before and after the lifting of the embargo. As mentioned above, 68% of (those 
in) the survey called for a political change in Vietnam to improve the human 
rights condition and to restore democracy there. However, it is unsettling to 
see that the poll also showed 54% support the lifting of the embargo. 
Furthermore, 79% believed that their participation in American politics was 
important to them. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible interpretation of the above statistics is that: faced with a fait 
accompli , the attitude of the Vietnamese community shifted to "resignation" as 
opposed to "silence," as asserted in the article, then the Vietnamese Americans 
resorted to diplomatic leverage as an alternative approach to accomplish what 
could not be done through the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 If the poll had been conducted before the embargo was lifted, the results 
might have shown that the majority of Vietnamese wanted to maintain the 
embargo. At best, the article conclusion is a stretching of the facts; at 
worse, it is a distortion of the Vietnamese community view.

DESPITE 30-YEAR WAR ON POVERTY, ONLY THE FACES SEEM TO CHANGE; APPALACHIA: IN 
1964, PRESIDENT JOHNSON VOWED TO ERADICATE POVERTY IN AMERICA. BUT PROBLEM 
REMAINS AND SUCCESSES ARE FEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This Administration today, here and now, declares war on poverty in America. . 
. . It will not be a short or easy struggle. No single weapon or strategy will 
suffice. But we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest nation on 
earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it.  
</P>
<P>
 -- President Lyndon B. Johnson, 1964 State of the Union address 
</P>
<P>
 Worn and weary-looking, they stand dozens-deep outside the ramshackle house's 
wood porch in dusty, steamy heat, waiting wordlessly and patiently for 
handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Men such as George Bolan, a former coal worker who has been jobless more than 
a year and has moved back in with his mother at age 57. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I find somewhere like this that's giving a little bit out, I try to get 
some. It helps a lot," he says, an asthmatic wheeze racking his chest as he 
carries his cardboard box of food to a borrowed pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, when President Lyndon Johnson called America to arms for a 
War on Poverty, Appalachia's poor lined up for government surplus commodities 
such as cheese and beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's church handout is one measure of how little progress has been made in 
three decades in some areas of Appalachia: a bag of potatoes, a box of 
nacho-cheese crackers, other snacks, tooth powder, cough medicine, 
antiperspirant and assorted odds and ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey, we'll take anything we can get," said the Rev. Hobert Cook, a former 
police chief who, after surviving a brain tumor 12 years ago, started an 
outreach ministry called God's Holiness Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish the good people of this country could come down here and see some 
of the faces," Cook said. "I don't think people know that there are places like 
this in America." 
</P>
<P>
 He would introduce Americans to Joyce Wood, 39; her husband was laid off by a 
timber company and has worked three months in the last two years. They receive 
$512 a month in government checks, gobbled up quickly by rent and expenses that 
include caring for a 13-year-old son who suffered brain damage during birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard . . . it's just hard," she said, shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Tolliver, 33, hasn't had steady work in four years. He and his wife have 
three small children, and can't afford a stove or oven or other basic 
furniture. Meals are cooked on wood fires. 
</P>
<P>
 A husky man with red hair and lowered eyes, he was reluctant to talk. Finally, 
he snapped: "I need everything! I ain't got nothing! There's no jobs around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, America did see faces like these when Johnson made a swing through 
the region some dubbed "The Other America" or "The Forgotten America." Unlike 
the inner-city poor, the faces of struggling Appalachians were white; living in 
rural pockets, they were out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Kennedy saw them while campaigning in West Virginia in 1960 and was 
deeply stirred; the anti-poverty crusade was part of his legacy to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Johnson stepped down after one term dominated by Vietnam. And periods 
of national indifference and local failures allowed deep pockets of poverty to 
remain -- towns such as War, where residents traded dependence upon the 
boom-and-bust coal industry for dependence upon government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My question is, what would have these areas been like today without the War 
on Poverty?" said U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), who put aside his 
millionaire lifestyle in the 1960s to become a West Virginia worker for VISTA, 
a kind of domestic Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 VISTA, Head Start, Upward Bound, the Job Corps and other programs started in 
the 1960s helped many escape poverty, Rockefeller said. Food stamps, Medicare 
and welfare have protected those who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in Appalachia agree that there has been progress in education and 
training, housing, health care and extensive road-building. 
</P>
<P>
 But failures also are apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements in the economy often are confined to the region's largest cities 
or rural county seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The many towns built around coal mines enjoyed boom years capped by the 1970s' 
oil shortages and price increases. But tapped-out mines and increased 
automation cost more than 93,000 jobs in the region since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Appalachia -- a large region centered in West Virginia and eastern 
Kentucky but stretching across 13 states from New York to Alabama -- there 
remain dozens of communities where progress is barely measurable. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Kentucky's Appalachian Center said in a new report that more 
than 31% of Appalachian Kentuckians live below the national poverty level, 
nearly the same rate as in 1965. Nationally, the average is 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 It reports clusters of communities in which nearly two-thirds of the residents 
live in severe poverty. "Real" unemployment figures, counting discouraged 
workers who have stopped looking for jobs, range beyond 50% in such 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see our needs now as greater than ever," said the Rev. Ralph Beiting, a 
Roman Catholic priest in Louisa, Ky., who has helped the poor for four decades 
through a variety of programs run by his Christian Appalachian Project. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia Secretary of State Ken Hechler, now 79, campaigned with Kennedy 
as a congressman in 1960 and recalls the optimistic days under Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The War on Poverty, he said, was undermined because out-of-state corporations 
that own most of the region's coal, timber and other resources weren't forced 
to pay more taxes and take on more responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, local politicians often turned the anti-poverty 
programs into political spoils doled out to allies and withheld from opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Without reforms, "it was like an aspirin to reduce the symptoms of poverty 
instead of antibiotics to cure the disease," Hechler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockefeller sees revitalized hope for the region's impoverished in the 
Clinton-Gore Administration, led by a president from a poor Delta state and a 
vice president from an Appalachian state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not as bad off as we used to be, but we're not nearly as good as we're 
going to be," pledged Democratic state Sen. Benny Ray Bailey, interviewed at a 
health care clinic in his Kentucky hometown of Hindman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best place in the world to live -- if you don't need a job," 
Bailey said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 His home region doesn't have the severe crime and overcrowding problems of the 
inner cities, and Bailey, who as a teen-ager turned out to watch Johnson's 
visit to Appalachian Kentucky in 1964, figures that state government reforms 
and efforts to diversify the economy should ease the glaring economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Eller, a 1960s anti-poverty worker who heads the Appalachian Center at the 
University of Kentucky, points to the new wave of political leaders who grew up 
during the war's early days. 
</P>
<P>
 Eller is angered by traditional suggestions that Appalachia's poor "hop a 
Greyhound" and ride one of the "Hillbilly Highways" to big-city jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 This region has lost tens of thousands of people over the years in massive 
out-migrations. Many prospered, but many others found themselves living ghetto 
existences, unable to find work above minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rather callous statement . . . that suggests a lack of desire or 
creativity," Eller said. "The rest of America has benefited from their people 
and their natural resources. They should be able to stay where they have a 
strong sense of place." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Stutso, at age 40, refused a transfer last year when his coal company was 
moving its operations out of War. Instead, he opened a sports shop with a 
tanning salon that admittedly does very slow business after the first week of 
the month, when government checks arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more to life than money," he said. "This is home, and you can't beat 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, he strolled down the street. His pickup was where he left it -- 
windows down, cassettes strewn across the front seat and key in the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not many places left where you can do this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who refuse to leave are convinced that things will get better -- that 
despite all of the failures of three decades, Appalachia may someday no longer 
serve as a paradigm for rural poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 At the food giveaway, church volunteer Anita Miller, age 53, reflected on the 
last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The War on Poverty is still being fought," she said. "It hasn't been settled 
yet."

31 YEARS LATER, TRAIN ROBBER ENJOYS LIFE IN RIO; BRAZIL: SCOTLAND YARD KNOWS 
WHERE RONALD BIGGS IS BUT CAN'T TOUCH HIM. FOR $50, HOWEVER, ANY TOURIST CAN 
DROP BY FOR LUNCH AND HEAR HIS TALES OF THE $7.3-MILLION HEIST AND HIS LIFE ON 
THE RUN.

 The camera pans in on a luxurious garden in Rio. A tanned, elderly man in a 
sports shirt and cream-colored slacks is relaxing in a garden chair, shaded by 
a palm tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The smiling man lifts a glass of whiskey, takes a sip, turns and says: 
"There's nothing like a good home alarm system when you're on the run. And if 
it makes me comfortable, imagine how safe you'll feel." 
</P>
<P>
 The star of this commercial knows his stuff when the topic is security or how 
to crack it: He is Ronald Biggs, one of the Great Train Robbers of 1963 who 
escaped the clutches of British lawmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs and 16 other men in stocking masks plundered the Glasgow-to-London Royal 
Mail Train of $7.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the bandits were convicted and sent to prison, but Biggs escaped. 
Five were never caught. Police recovered some of the $7.3 million, but it's not 
clear what happened to the rest. Biggs managed to stash his booty with various 
friends in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalked by Scotland Yard, bounty hunters and foreign police in the aftermath 
of the legendary holdup, Biggs led his pursuers across three continents before 
finding refuge in Rio in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Biggs is not hard to find. A winding, cobbled street up a quiet 
hillside leads to his "hide-out" -- a colonial apartment with a terrace and 
pool that looks out over shimmering Guanabara Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yard has known the address for 24 years. But Biggs is untouchable -- as 
long as he keeps his nose clean and stays where he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs worked hard to craft an image as a working-class Robin Hood, a charming 
rogue who was outgunned and outnumbered but who foiled his enemies and made off 
with a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a genteel 64, Biggs is sculpting a new image -- that of a distinguished 
chap who has given up his light-fingered ways to lead an honorable, cultured 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think of myself as the last of the gentlemen crooks," said Biggs, 
leaning back on a leather couch and sipping his favorite tea, Twinings Earl 
Grey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours was the last decent crime. Compared to the violent capers of today, why, 
what we did was puff stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 To make his point, Biggs published in January his second volume of memoirs, 
"Odd Man Out: My Life On the Loose and the Truth About the Great Train 
Robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 The book gives Biggs' version of the robbery and chronicles his marathon 
battle for freedom and transformation from London hood to pseudo gentleman of 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 The title "Odd Man Out" is pure Biggsian irony: "The 11 other men convicted of 
the crime served sentences in prison. I was the only one who did time out of 
jail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 People want to believe in the charming rascal who twisted the British lion's 
tail. Many tend to forgive Biggs' criminal past and not press him on exactly 
what he did in his underworld days. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs doesn't resemble the "most wanted" desperadoes whose craggy faces snarl 
from FBI posters on post office walls. Even in his twilight years, he conjures 
up a contemporary Beau Brummell. 
</P>
<P>
 He can be self-parodying and his humor is soft in tone. His cockney accent is 
agreeable, his vocabulary precise, rhythmic, with allegro touches. 
</P>
<P>
 For a hood, his tastes are quite stylish. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs won't use anything but Gucci cologne and deodorant, and Cussons shaving 
cream. He drinks Twinings tea five times a day, loves oysters and enjoys only 
Harrods cheddar cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 He pays great attention to detail, especially with his wardrobe. He likes 
linen trousers, silk shirts and sleeps in Chanel No. 5 night wear. 
</P>
<P>
 A notorious womanizer, Biggs is in his third "marriage," with Ulla Sopher, an 
Argentine. They call each other husband and wife, but live in separate houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Arthur Biggs was born in the Lambeth district of London on Aug. 8, 
1929. His father was a bus driver and hotel cook. His mother, a housewife, 
pampered him and his three older siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Ronnie started "nicking" candy from corner shops in grade school, and 
gradually moved on to lead pencil refills and radio parts. At 16, he stole and 
sold his brother's gold Rolex watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stealing meant adventure to me," Biggs said. "I craved the thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 His adventures landed him in prison six times by his 28th birthday. In 1957, 
Biggs met his first wife -- 18-year-old Charmain Powell -- on a train. They 
married and had three sons, and Biggs set up a construction firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The business soured and in 1963 Biggs sought out an old prison mate, Bruce 
Reynolds, for a loan. The smooth-talking Reynolds instead offered him a role in 
a train-robbing scheme they had always dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 On a moonlit August night, the gang halted the Royal Mail Train at the 
Buckinghamshire junction north of London and vanished with 125 bags of pound 
notes earmarked for the shredder. 
</P>
<P>
 There was but one hitch -- the injury to Jack Mills, 57, the chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills fought his assailants and was rapped on the head with a tape-wrapped ax 
handle. He got 11 stitches but never fully recovered, and died in 1969 of 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's press said Biggs was the thug who reduced Mills to a semi-vegetable 
state -- a charge he denied. But years later, Biggs expressed remorse. "I've 
always felt bad about Mills," he said. "I detest any kind of violence, even a 
bop on the noggin." 
</P>
<P>
 A jury gave him the maximum 30-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Under close surveillance and forced to sew mailbags -- a task he hardly found 
amusing -- Biggs scaled the wall of the Wandsworth prison with three other 
inmates on July 8, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 It began an odyssey that would take him to Paris, where he had a face lift and 
took on a new identity; to Australia, where he settled three separate times 
under three aliases with his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with Scotland Yard closing in on him, he left his family behind and 
made a last-minute escape aboard a luxury liner to Panama. He arrived -- 
virtually broke -- in Rio on March 11, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived as a carpenter, and came close to turning himself in only once. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 2, 1971, Biggs' 10-year-old son, Nicky, died in a car accident in 
Melbourne, Australia. Devastated, he went immediately to the door of the 
British Consulate. At the last instant, though, he decided against it and 
walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 British authorities finally found him in 1974. But luck was with Biggs too: 
Brazil had never signed an extradition treaty with Britain. So when Chief Supt. 
Jack Slipper came with the handcuffs, Brazilian authorities barred him from 
taking Biggs back. 
</P>
<P>
 In another twist, Biggs' Brazilian mistress -- a 23-year-old waitress and call 
girl -- discovered she was pregnant, which protected him under a law that bars 
the deportation of the father of a dependent Brazilian child. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Biggs was hardly free as a bird. Twice a week he had to report to the 
police. He couldn't work or marry, stay out past 10 p.m. or leave Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he did, but it wasn't his idea. One afternoon in 1981 a man identifying 
himself as a foreign journalist asked to interview him at a restaurant at the 
base of Rio's Sugar Loaf Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men jumped Biggs, blindfolded and gagged him, and threw him in a canvas 
sack. A Learjet flew him to the Amazon port city of Belem, where he was put on 
a yacht that set sail for Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
 Then another lucky stroke: The Barbados Parliament had not voted on an 
extradition treaty with Britain, and Biggs was returned to Brazil. The episode 
turned Biggs into a cult figure. And he has milked his fame plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 His best scam comes from travel agencies who arrange for foreign tourists to 
have lunch with the Great Train Robber at his home -- at $50 a head. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs throws a few steaks and sausages on the barbecue, cracks open a few 
liters of rum and whiskey, has a few girls dance a samba around the pool, and 
spins yarns of his famous flight. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Brazil rejected Biggs' request for permanent residency, but 
allowed Biggs to marry, adopt a child and travel out of Rio state. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's safe from deportation, at least until his son, Michael, turns 21 in 
two years. What will he do then? 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as Mike is in school, he's legally my dependent," Biggs said. "Who 
knows? Maybe he'll become a professional student."

 Forget "Middlemarch," "Civilization" and all those other highbrow BBC 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are getting a taste of the stuff Britons really watch: Mr. Blobby, a 
fat, clumsy, pink creature resembling a giant, polka-dotted jellyfish. 
</P>
<P>
 For the British Broadcasting Corp., he's been very, very profitable. Now he 
carries the corporation's hopes of beating Barney the purple dinosaur in the 
rich U.S. children's market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking tens of billions of dollars here," Michael Gury, vice president 
for product marketing at BBC Lionheart Television, said Friday.

 Or as Mr. Blobby would say: "Blobby! Blobby! Blobby!"

EUROPEAN GYPSIES FORGOTTEN VICTIMS IN STORY OF NAZI GENOCIDE; HOLOCAUST: 
GERMANS TARGETED THEM, ALONG WITH JEWS AND OTHERS, FOR ELIMINATION. THEY WERE 
ROUNDED UP, BRUTALIZED, INTERNED, DEPORTED. BUT GYPSIES ARE UNSURE OF THEIR 
HISTORY AND RELUCTANT TO DISCUSS THE HORROR.

<P>
 Fifty years ago, Karoly Lendvai was caught up in the Nazi horror, and narrowly 
escaped becoming one of the millions who died. But he still doesn't know what 
happened or why. He isn't even familiar with such terms as Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendvai, a 65-year-old Gypsy, lives in a hut built of bricks, mud, a little of 
this and a little of that. He is a survivor of a largely overlooked chapter in 
the history of Nazi genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did they do it?" he asked an interviewer poking into a trove of memories 
a half-century old. "Because I'm a Gypsy? That can't be. That's no reason." 
</P>
<P>
 It could be, and it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Gypsies were rounded up, brutalized, interned, deported. Nazi doctor Josef 
Mengele conducted medical experiments on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybil Milton, deputy director of the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the author of a 
study of Nazi policies toward Gypsies, cites high-ranking German officials in 
the 1930s as concluding that "the national socialist state will have to settle 
the Gypsy question just as it has solved the Jewish question." 
</P>
<P>
 Thought to have descended from a tribe that left India in the fifth century, 
Gypsies have suffered prejudice and defied assimilation in Europe for 
centuries. The Nazis considered them an inferior race. Just like millions of 
Jews, Gypsies were designated for liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven million people -- 6 million of them Jews -- are thought to have died in 
Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining the number of Gypsies killed is difficult because they were not 
registered, and many died in transit and were buried in unmarked graves, said 
Waclaw Dlugoborski, curator for scientific research at the Auschwitz Museum and 
historian at Poland's Wroclaw University. 
</P>
<P>
 He said estimates for all of Europe range from 200,000 to 500,000 dead. In 
Poland, an estimated 70% of the Gypsies died. French Nazi hunter Serge 
Klarsfeld said no French historian so far has taken the time to search French 
or German archives carefully for material on the Gypsy Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to draw attention to the question, Dlugoborski is organizing an 
international commemoration of the Gypsy Holocaust Aug. 2-3 at Auschwitz, the 
infamous extermination site. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are an estimated 15 million Gypsies in Europe, a half-million of 
them in Hungary. They are Hungary's largest minority. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had ever asked Lendvai what happened to him, and he had not spoken of 
it outside his own family. Given his people's oral tradition and a longstanding 
climate of prejudice against Gypsies, little was said -- much less written -- 
about their suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, Gypsies do not know their own history," said Gypsy author Menyhert 
Lakatos. "It was not in anyone's interest to enlighten them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary was allied with Germany but generally did not transport its Jews, 
Gypsies and others to Nazi camps until German soldiers came in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago this summer -- Lendvai cannot remember the month -- Hungarian 
police descended on the town of Szentgal 75 miles southwest of Budapest where 
he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 They began forcing a dozen Gypsy families to walk 45 miles north to Komarom, 
location of the notorious Csillag internment camp run by Hungary's variant of 
the Nazis, the Arrow Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we were marched through villages, others joined our group, more Gypsies 
and more gendarmes," recalled Lendvai in a soft, hoarse voice. "Some babies 
died along the way, and some would-be escapees were shot, left by the roadside. 
No one knows who they were." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the camp about two weeks with hardly any food, and even water was 
scarce," he continued. "More people died as typhus broke out, and others were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dead were thrown into a huge pit, covered with quicklime. There were 
layers upon layers of dead. I do not know when the pit was finally filled 
because one day we were herded into cattle cars, to be taken I don't know 
where." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rot, you Jew-Gypsy!" he recalled an Arrow Cross gendarme screaming at him as 
they were shoved onto the train. 
</P>
<P>
 A wiry man with hands gnarled by years of dawn-to-dusk work and a tanned, 
lined face, Lendvai does not give the impression of one open to many doubts. 
But today he still wonders: "Why did he call me a Jew?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was saved by an air raid. "Suddenly, there were sirens, and bombs were 
falling. The car I was in was damaged, and some of us escaped. We hid in the 
woods for about a year. . . . I never saw the others again." 
</P>
<P>
 Erzsebet Kolompar of Sorokpolany, 120 miles southwest of Budapest, recalled 
similar scenes. She was saved when Arrow Cross guards fled the advancing Soviet 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendvai did not know the word "Holocaust," but he does know that many of his 
people suffered from it. His own family perished. 
</P>
<P>
 Records indicate that people from the Komarom camp were shipped to Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is every reason to believe that had the war dragged on or had Hitler 
won, all Gypsies would have been exterminated," said Agnes Daroczi, an activist 
who anchors a weekly program on Gypsy affairs on Hungarian state television. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the public largely unaware of the Gypsy Holocaust, but many 
Gypsies themselves know nothing about it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is an oral culture, and there is low contact level among the various 
Gypsy communities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is seeking survivors for a feature-length documentary to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the extermination of a Gypsy camp at Birkenau, otherwise known 
as Auschwitz II because of its proximity. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengele conducted medical experiments on Gypsy children, including twins. Most 
of them died, wrote Hermann Langbein, a prisoner-doctor at Auschwitz, in a 1975 
book. U.S. journalist and historian William Shirer wrote in "The Rise and Fall 
of the Third Reich" that Gypsies were selected at Dachau and Buchenwald to see 
how they might be able to live on salt water. 
</P>
<P>
 Andras T. Hegedues, a Budapest University professor and expert on minority 
affairs, said 50,000 to 60,000 Gypsies were deported in 1944-45. He cannot 
determine how many were sent to Hungarian camps and how many went to Nazi 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am also aware that many people were killed on the spot as they were rounded 
up, and no records of those killings exit," Hegedues said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franciszek Piper, head of the Auschwitz Museum's historical department, said 
23,000 Gypsies were taken to Birkenau, and nearly 21,000 died there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ratio of Gypsies killed was as high as that of Jews," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors like Lendvai and Kolompar welcome the effort to tell their story to 
Hungarians and the world at large after a half-century of silence. But Daroczi, 
the TV journalist, said younger Gypsies are suspicious and largely hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 Their view, built on a history of repression, is: "No need to give them 
ideas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Istvan Tauber, a Budapest University professor, said his doctoral study of 
recent attitudes toward Gypsies found that almost 40% of more than 800 people 
interviewed still favored some sort of discrimination against Gypsies. About 
2.7% said they supported physical liquidation.

BUSH LIBRARY TEAM PLAYS FIRST INNING IN BOWLING ALLEY; HISTORY: YALE BASEBALL 
GLOVE, GIFTS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, DOCUMENTS, AND OLD FURNITURE FROM THE 
EX-PRESIDENT'S CHILDHOOD ARE INCLUDED. OFFICIALS ARE PREPARING FOR MUSEUM'S 
OPENING IN 1997.

<P>
 The stuff of George Bush's life -- an old infielder's mitt, the door of a 
Kuwaiti palace, even a huge likeness of Bush's head from a Republican 
convention -- is being sorted in an old bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there's not enough room in the old Chimney Hill Bowl for 36 million 
pages of documents, a million photos and 40,000 objects. So some of it is 
crammed next door, in what used to be the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, this will be the treasure of the George Bush Presidential Library and 
Museum at Texas A&M University. But for now, it's just pile upon pile of Bush 
fodder for the archivists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to preserve, arrange and review and ultimately try to make as much 
available as we can to the American people,' said David Alsobrook, acting 
director of the Bush Presidential Materials Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual library and museum -- an $83-million project -- is about 90% 
complete on an engineer's drawing board. Groundbreaking is planned for November 
with dedication in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Alsobrook and his staff of 10 researchers from the National 
Archives have three years to catalogue and organize items that filled four C-5A 
cargo planes in the days just before Bush vacated the White House in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The material isn't confined to Bush's presidency. Other items come from his 
eight years as vice president, his tenure as a Texas congressman, as CIA 
director and other government stops that accounted for dozens of moves his 
family made around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 They even include scarred furniture that made many of the moves and date back 
to home movies of Bush as a child. The museum also has the left-handed first 
baseman's glove Bush used at Yale. "BUSH," prominent in capital block letters, 
was carved into the leather decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Material from all over the world continues to arrive as foreign governments 
and ordinary citizens deliver gifts and Bush memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a static collection. It's forever growing," said Patricia 
Burchfield, the museum curator. "Every day is like Christmas around here. 
There's some really spectacular things." 
</P>
<P>
 A gold model of a Saudi palace. Gold swords and jewelry from grateful Saudis 
and Kuwaitis for Bush's role in the Gulf War. A saddle from Mexico. At least 
two golf bags and sets of clubs. A porcelain candelabra from Germany. A section 
of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 One Oklahoman who served in Desert Storm sent a piece of marble column he said 
came from Saddam Hussein's summer palace in northern Iraq. An emir from Kuwait 
sent Bush a door from his palace, trimmed with gold and engraved with the names 
of American soldiers killed during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're looking at here is very recent American history," said Alsobrook, 
who spent 10 years at the Carter Presidential Library in Georgia before drawing 
the Bush assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniformed guards patrol the premises. There are closed-circuit television 
monitors and sophisticated electronic detectors along walls and doors. Some 
printed material is classified and will remain so for years; it is open only to 
those with top-secret clearances. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also rows of shelves holding campaign signs, banners and buttons. 
"We've got every piece of important campaign memorabilia that deals with George 
Bush," said Burchfield, who spent 20 years at the Lyndon Johnson Library in 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 A warehouse-like room where bowlers once racked up strikes now has 58 lanes of 
stacked shelves filled with boxes of printed documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just take little bites," Alsobrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Alsobrook and his staff try to organize the collection, Don Wilson is 
charged with finding a way to pay for the three-building complex on a 90-acre 
site at the west end of campus, across from the goat and sheep center. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum and library will be the centerpiece of the Center for Presidential 
Studies, the Center for Public Leadership Studies, the Center for International 
Studies, the George Bush School of Government and Public Service and several 
Texas A&M academic departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The university has committed $41 million. Wilson, executive director of the 
Bush Presidential Library Foundation and former director of the Gerald Ford 
Library, has raised about half of the $42 million he needs. He expects to 
complete the fund raising in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in good shape," he said. "It's not a tough sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush has insisted it be a working place for historians and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a little bit self-conscious and really doesn't want this to be a 
monument," Wilson said. "But he's pretty comfortable with it and very 
interested because he wants to spend a lot of time here." 
</P>
<P>
 Computerization of written documents is making the job of sorting documents 
somewhat easier. Historians eventually will be able to use key words or phrases 
to find what Bush said about a particular subject and when he said it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, historians will note that in 6,786 speeches or public statements, 
Bush mentioned his least favorite vegetable -- broccoli -- 54 times.

FUR FLIES OVER CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSALS TO CURB COLONIES OF STRAY CATS 
</P>

<P>
 Until the law caught up with them, the 20 stray cats of Riverside Park led a 
charmed existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The portly tabbies spent their days wandering sun-dappled bike trails and 
lolling on the rocks overlooking the Potomac River. Dinner came on schedule 
every day, a huge mound of cat chow toted in by feline-fancying neighbors of 
this leafy National Park Service land south of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The lucky creatures belonged to a managed colony, an outdoor welfare plan for 
abandoned cats, underwritten by devoted volunteers. Such colonies, consisting 
of six to 100 cats, are rapidly spreading across the United States. California 
alone has more than 100 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In some circles, however, they're wearing out their welcome. With increasing 
frequency, bird lovers and other conservationists resist locating cat colonies 
in parks, on beaches and in other natural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone has to take responsibility," said Louise Holton, who three years ago 
helped found Alley Cat Allies, the national feral cat network, based in 
Mt.Rainier, Md. "There are 60 million abandoned cats out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Stangel, program director of the Neotropical Migratory Bird 
Institute, said: "Cats are really ferocious predators. They should be kept 
inside. Colonies of cats should be removed." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a concept developed 20 years ago in England, the network teaches cat 
lovers how to manage colonies of feral animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-appointed caretakers feed and water the cats daily and see to their 
health needs. Every cat that can be trapped is vaccinated and sterilized. The 
volunteers usually pay all the bills, sometimes for as many as 150 cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Caretakers rescue unwanted cats from the short, brutish lives that strays 
customarily lead and save them from a one-way trip to an animal shelter. About 
6 million unwanted cats are euthanized in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescuers often move cats into natural areas to isolate them from cars and 
human cat-abusers. That puts concentrations of the animals close to birds and 
other vulnerable wildlife. Conservationists are particularly concerned about 
threatened or endangered songbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Research supports their point. Feral cats have nearly wiped out parrot 
populations on some Caribbean islands. One study in Britain estimated that the 
country's 5 million house cats kill 70 million small animals each year, 
including 20 million birds. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study of radio-collared farm cats in Wisconsin estimated that 
free-ranging cats kill 19 million songbirds and 140,000 game birds in the state 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Feral cats also threaten reptiles. They have reduced the density of ground 
lizards in the desert parks near Tucson, Ariz., and eradicated generations of 
young marine lizards on at least one island in the Galapagos archipelago off 
Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonies intensify the problem. "What you get is a dense pack of predators," 
said Ron Jurek, an endangered-wildlife biologist with the California Department 
of Fish and Game. "Normally, there aren't more than about a dozen predators per 
square mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Caretakers insist that their well-fed cats aren't that interested in prey. 
"Cats are just a scapegoat," Holton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But animal behaviorists say that a cat's brain is wired to hunt, even if its 
belly is full. Nor do bells and declawing reduce a cat's efficiency, they say. 
The cunning hunters simply adapt to the handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Several states have tried legislation. Animal-control experts argue for 
licensing, mandatory sterilization and limits on the number of cats anyone can 
own or care for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get constant complaints about cats," said Alvina Pitches, president of the 
Virginia Federation of Humane Societies. "They hang around bird feeders, they 
yowl all night or there are just too many of them around." 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone who takes on the feral cat lobby quickly learns how strong it is. 
One survey estimates that 15 million Americans feed 35 million feral cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a coalition of California environmental and animal-rights 
groups thought it had the votes to pass a law requiring owners to sterilize all 
free-roaming cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Alley Cat Allies, which supports sterilization, originally supported the 
legislation. But when caretakers found that they, too, would be considered 
owners, they launched an emotional campaign that defeated the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people don't subscribe to ecology principles," said John McCaull, 
California legislative director for the National Audubon Society. "But 
politicians see how controversial this is and say, 'Hey, this is cats. I've got 
better things to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 College campuses are a frequent scene of these battles. Students often abandon 
cats when they move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton is a case in point. With its 
president's blessing, a librarian maintains a colony of 35 or more cats on the 
campus, even though the campus is a sanctuary for burrowing owls, the only 
ground-nesting owl in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of owls has dwindled since the cats arrived, said Sheila Mahoney, a 
zoology professor. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the cat lovers seem to have the upper hand, perhaps for the same 
reason that books about cats are best sellers and cat food sales outpace baby 
food sales. Cats are the most popular pet in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Riverside Park, the cats lost. Despite hate mail, letters to newspapers 
and threats, the National Park Service in April began trapping the animals and 
delivering them to the county shelter, where they face probable euthanasia.

'CRAZY' COUNSELOR SOWS SEEDS FOR COLLEGE, REAPS 100% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Tammye Schmidt was headed for a career styling hair. She already worked part 
time as a hairdresser, and come June 26, she figured, school would be over for 
good, and none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Schmidt plans to go to community college, maybe even pursue a 
four-year degree. What changed her mind? 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. J followed me around for weeks, telling me to get my college applications 
in. For weeks!" the auburn-haired 17-year-old said with a smile. "I told him 
I'm doing hair, I don't need college. But he kept pushing until I realized I 
should do it. Not for him. For me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. J" is Paul Jankiewicz, bearded poet, ego-booster, guidance counselor and 
guiding star. Thanks to the prodding and encouragement of this self-proclaimed 
"crazy person," all 160 members of Poughkeepsie High's Class of 1994 applied to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 And every one of them got in. 
</P>
<P>
 No small feat for an inner-city school with an enrollment that is 70% minority 
and mostly poor and where few families have a college tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these kids still suffer the vestiges of racism," Jankiewicz said. 
"And for some of them the home environment is horrifying. It's a wonder they 
survive. It's our job to help them build strength from within. It's like the 
fire that strengthens the steel." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, 75% of high school students in New York state apply to college, 
said Bill Hirschen of the state Education Department. To have 100% apply is a 
remarkable achievement, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Each incoming freshman class at Poughkeepsie is routinely assigned a guidance 
counselor who remains with the students until graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, when Jankiewicz set out to sow college dreams in the minds of 
his new and disinclined freshman class, he hoped merely to raise the percentage 
of college applications from 50% to at least 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, every one of his seniors applied to college and every one was 
accepted. It was the first time in the school's 133 years that had happened. 
This year is the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This class drove me crazy for three years," Jankiewicz said. "They're the 
ones who gave me this white hair. Some of them were so smug. But they finally 
got the message last year, and this year they just took off." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a reputation as a rough school, with lots of violence and drugs," 
said Natalia Sanders, 18, an honors student headed for New York University. 
"It's not true, but that's what people think because we're an inner-city 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Poughkeepsie has seen better days. There are weedy sidewalks and boarded-up, 
graffiti-sprayed storefronts downtown. Unemployment is high among 
Poughkeepsie's 35,000 residents, with layoffs at one of the region's largest 
employers, IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was forced out of IBM, and now he's struggling with his own 
business," said Bobbett Plummer, 18, who will be a pre-med student at Howard 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing their parents falter in seemingly solid jobs has made the students all 
the more receptive to Jankiewicz's message: To succeed in life, one must never 
stop learning, growing and adapting to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. J makes us take courses in everything so we can get exposed to things we 
might not have considered," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jankiewicz had taught counseling to graduate students, run a video production 
business and conducted poetry workshops at community centers and jails before 
coming here 10 years ago to help care for his elderly father. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a teaching job at Poughkeepsie High, he was offered the guidance 
job instead. He had found his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certified crazy person," is the legend on his key chain and coffee mug. 
</P>
<P>
 Jankiewicz is dogged in his insistence that his students set high goals for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll follow you in his car on the street, beeping his horn, telling you to 
get that college work sheet in," said Tim Dedrick, 19, who arm-wrestled 
Jankiewicz for help in getting his grades changed and lost, thus having to mow 
the counselor's lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of keeping them on track, knowing someone's watching out for 
them," Jankiewicz said, "not just at school but in the community."

TOSCANI USES REAGAN CARICATURE AS AIDS COMMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oliviero Toscani, whose ads for fashion firm Benetton have shocked millions, 
has done it again with a fake obituary of former President Ronald Reagan and a 
picture with his face retouched as if he suffered from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The "obituary" and picture are published as a sarcastic editorial attacking 
Reagan in the latest edition of Colors, the Benetton magazine of which 
photographer Toscani is editorial director. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture shows lesions on Reagan's face; AIDS victims are susceptible to 
many diseases, including skin cancers, because the virus weakens their immune 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The fake obituary in a special edition of the magazine on the subject of AIDS 
sarcastically praises Reagan's "quick and decisive response to the AIDS 
epidemic early in his presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 Toscani told the Turin newspaper La Stampa he ran the retouched picture and 
fake obituary because he said Reagan disregarded alarms about the AIDS threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Toscani has created Benetton's most controversial ads, including images of 
buttocks stamped with a logo saying "HIV Positive," and of a priest kissing a 
nun.

4 MIAMI POLICEMEN CONVICTED OF COVERUP IN DEALER'S DEATH 
</P>

<P>
 Four police officers were convicted of misleading investigators to cover up a 
1988 beating death of a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Camacho, Charlie Haynes Jr., Nathaniel Veal Jr. and Andy Watson were 
found guilty last week of one count of multiple charges of obstruction of 
justice and misleading law enforcement officers. Each faces a maximum 10 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the four officers were acquitted of charges they conspired to violate 
Leonardo Mercado's civil rights by killing him. The verdicts sparked rioting in 
Wynwood, the Puerto Rican neighborhood where Mercado lived.

TWO TEENS SENT TO MENTAL CENTER FOR DAD'S GRISLY DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers were sent to mental health centers for the murder of their 
father, who was shot by his daughter and chopped up and burned in a wood stove 
by his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Butler, 15, her brother Timmy, 14, and their mother, Donna, confessed to 
the Jan. 15 murder of Tim Butler at the family's ramshackle cabin.The mother is 
scheduled to be sentenced in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah, a cheerleader and honor student, shot her father as he slept and as her 
mother stood beside her, authorities said. Timmy admitted helping his mother 
dispose of the body, first by burning it, then by cutting it up with a meat saw 
and burning the remains in a wood stove. 
</P>
<P>
 The three said Butler psychologically abused them, and a psychologist said 
they feared he would kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge John Henson placed both children in state custody. He 
recommended the two go to separate treatment centers until their 21st 
birthdays.

WHALE WATCH ADDED TO OIL SPILL CHORES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coast Guard helicopter pilots scanning the waters of Stellwagen Bank for oil 
spills have taken on a new duty: whale watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are 
teaming up to protect marine mammals in the wildlife-rich waters of the bank, a 
national marine sanctuary off the Massachusetts coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots will look for whales in distress, whether they're stranded in 
shallows or harassed by overzealous whale watchers, said Coast Guard Petty 
Officer Amy Gaskill. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots will be armed with rules governing whale watchers, and trained by 
sanctuary manager Brad Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 Stellwagen Bank covers 638 square nautical miles of ocean between Cape Cod and 
Cape Ann. It is teeming with plankton and fish that form part of the food chain 
that sustains the humpback, fin, sei and northern right whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational and commercial fishing boats cruise its waters, along with 
whale-watching vessels from nearby Provincetown and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated a protected area by Congress in November, 1992, Stellwagen Bank is 
one of 13 national marine sanctuaries administered by the NOAA.

HOSPITALS FOUND TO SKIP PREGNANCY HEPATITIS B TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quarter of hospitals surveyed last year failed to test pregnant women for 
hepatitis B, which new mothers can transmit to their infants, according to 
federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 review of 183 hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention recently found that 138, or 75%, routinely screened expectant 
mothers for the virus either at a prenatal visit or at the time of delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, about 22,000 infants are born to women with chronic hepatitis B, 
which causes inflammation of the liver and jaundice. The newborns are at high 
risk of becoming infected by their mothers and can go on to develop chronic 
liver disease or even liver cancer as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Most health care groups and federal health agencies have urged maternal 
screening for hepatitis B since about 1990, said Dr. Frank Mahoney, chief of 
the CDC's Hepatitis B Prevention Branch. But because infected newborns don't 
develop symptoms of chronic liver disease for decades, physicians often 
overlook checking the mother for the virus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine states -- California, New York, North Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, Rhode 
Island, Nevada, Michigan and Missouri -- have enacted laws requiring hospitals 
to screen expectant mothers.

GERMAN TOURIST SURVIVES PLUNGE FROM 15TH FLOOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 A German tourist fell from the top of a 15-story building and survived with 
barely a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old man was under the influence of alcohol and hashish when he 
climbed to the top floor of a suburban Copenhagen condominium Thursday to enjoy 
the view, said Danish police officer Kim Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought he was going to vomit and lost his balance as he leaned over the 
balcony, 150 feet from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong winds kept the man away from the building. He hit some electrical wires 
and bounced onto a tree top before landing on a patch of grass. A rotted wooden 
lamppost broke under his weight as he hit the wires. 
</P>
<P>
 He got up immediately with only a small cut in the forehead and a bruised 
thigh, Christensen said.

PARENTS OF HIV-POSITIVE GIRL SHUN DRUG AZT; MEDICINE: THEIR DECISION COMES AMID 
RISING EVIDENCE THAT THE DRUG IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS HOPED, AND THAT THE SIDE 
EFFECTS CAN OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lindsey Nagel brought two mementos from her native Romania when she was 
adopted by a Minnesota couple in 1990: a stuffed toy panda and HIV, the virus 
that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxy the panda is a visible reminder of Lindsey's homeland. The virus, which 
hasn't developed into full-blown AIDS, is not apparent in the vivacious 3 
1/2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey's parents, Steve and Cheryl Nagel, credit her health to their defiance 
of doctor's orders in the fall of 1992. They stopped giving their only child 
the drug AZT because it caused an upset stomach, loss of appetite and severe 
leg cramps. The little girl woke up night after night -- often more than once a 
night -- gripping a leg and crying in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, I wasn't going to put that kid through a bunch of misery so she 
could live another six months. I would rather have her live two good months 
than to have her live six bad months," Steve Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lindsey has gone without any medication for nearly a year and a half under 
a different doctor's care and is outwardly healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more studies seem to support the Nagels' decision in light of the 
side effects of AZT, and other patients around the country have sworn off the 
drug. Some have never taken it. 
</P>
<P>
 AZT is the common name for azidothymidine, the first antiviral drug approved 
for use against the AIDS virus and still the one most commonly used. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies last year showed that giving AZT to people who are not yet sick 
doesn't help them live longer but modestly delays the onset of symptoms. A 
study published in the March 17 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine 
suggests that the drug's side effects outweigh any benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 While the drug's maker, Burroughs Wellcome, says the study doesn't mean 
physicians should stop using AZT in early treatment, it also said the issue 
comes down to patient choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts think the drug's effectiveness begins decreasing after six months and 
is nearly diminished after two years, according to Derek Link, a treatment 
advocate for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a private, nonprofit social service 
agency in New York. Lindsey had taken AZT for 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The question has become when to take advantage of those beneficial effects -- 
before or after symptoms develop, Link said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you the little golden rule here, because there isn't one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel, a restaurant kitchen manager, and his wife, a real estate agent's 
assistant, acknowledge they also don't have all of the answers about AIDS. 
They're not even sure how Lindsey was infected. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born Oct. 15, 1990, to a poor, single woman with three other girls in 
Petrosani, a coal-mining town in the Transylvanian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Lindsey's mother is HIV-negative, they believe Lindsey received tainted 
blood in a transfusion while she was hospitalized for an ailment before her 
adoption was final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nagels learned of the infection in early 1991, after a battery of tests 
recommended for all international adoptees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst day of my life," Cheryl Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, she and her husband told no one except family about Lindsey's 
HIV status, hiding the grim reality while trying cheerfully to accept 
congratulations and baby outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought in my mind I'll take all these clothes back to Dayton's or wherever 
they got them and buy . . . a black dress and save the rest for the coffin," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning a funeral was never far from their minds, because doctors gave 
Lindsey only a 20% chance of reaching her second birthday, Steve Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nagels' outlook changed after they decided on their own to stop giving 
Lindsey AZT around her second birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty shaky to let go of it because you're going against the whole 
medical community," Steve Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians have been generally more inclined to prescribe AZT for children 
without symptoms than for asymptomatic adults because the disease usually 
progresses more rapidly in children, said AIDS researcher Paul Volberding, 
director of the AIDS program at San Francisco General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Volberding said doctors try to strike a balance between benefits 
and side effects when deciding whether to prescribe AZT. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's quite appropriate to stop the therapy for patients who have 
severe toxicity of drugs. In general, you can't expect to get much benefit from 
a drug if the patient doesn't tolerate it," Volberding said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nagels say they'll never give Lindsey AZT again. 
</P>
<P>
 Little by little, they've allowed themselves to think about her future. The 
Nagels, who are both 36, bought life insurance for themselves and opened a 
savings account in her name. They take joy in Lindsey's eagerness to learn, her 
energy and inquisitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day she asks me what we're going to do today. I say we're going to get 
up and eat breakfast and then we'll worry about what we're going to do," Cheryl 
Nagel said.

'POSTER FATHER' WEARY OF SOUR FATE; KENTUCKY: TOM FLETCHER STILL LIVES IN THE 
HILLSIDE HOUSE WHERE LYNDON JOHNSON VISITED. HE VOICES RESENTMENT OVER MEDIA 
INTEREST IN HIS LIFE STORY, IN WHICH MOST LUCK HAS BEEN BAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Fletcher was already waging his own private battle with poverty when the 
President showed up on his front porch and drafted him into a "war." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyndon B. Johnson chose the 38-year-old unemployed father of eight "to 
illustrate the human toll the declining mining industry had taken on these 
Appalachian families," Lady Bird Johnson would write. 
</P>
<P>
 The images from Fletcher's humble home in the rugged eastern Kentucky hills 
were an opening salvo in Johnson's ambitious War on Poverty in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years later, the Martin County man still lives in the hillside house 
where Johnson squatted and chatted with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Fletcher said he hoped Johnson's visit "would bring us some luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a rare interview, he voiced resentment of pursuit by reporters 
updating a life story in which most luck has been bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting tired of it," said Fletcher, now 68. "After all this time, I'd 
think they would be letting it go." 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the rest of the country insists on seeing poverty as symbols and 
stereotypes . . . people will always be fascinated with Tom Fletcher," said Ron 
Eller, director of the University of Kentucky Appalachian Center. "For every 
Tom Fletcher, there were many, many thousands of others in the region who have 
been able to improve their quality of life and to struggle to improve their 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin County remains site of one of the hardest struggles. The Appalachian 
Center estimates 35.4% of its population -- three times the national average -- 
lives in poverty and says unofficial unemployment rates have reached 57%. 
</P>
<P>
 The vagaries of dependence upon the coal industry took their toll, with 1,700 
well-paying coal jobs, or more than half, lost since 1980 in Martin. Despite 
persistent economic woes, folks here generally agree that there has been 
progress -- in housing, transportation, public health and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all things come together," said Phyllis Walker, director of the local 
office of the Big Sandy Community Action Council, an anti-poverty program. "We 
see successes all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher made good fodder in 1964 for the high-profile campaign Johnson 
wanted. Today, he makes good fodder for those who highlight its failures. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, Fletcher had earned just $400 from sporadic sawmill work. He had also 
worked in the mines and on the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 He had paid $100 for his tiny, coal-heated house on Rockcastle Creek and got 
government help to install electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Fletcher resents descriptions of his home as a tar-paper-covered 
shack. He insists the house -- now covered in blue planking with white trim -- 
had brick siding when Johnson visited. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an upswing for Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1965, he was earning $42 a week while studying auto mechanics through the 
Manpower Development and Training Program. He also worked on a 
government-funded road crew, known locally as "happy pappy" gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never got a mechanic's job, and a broken leg in 1969 ended his last 
regular employment. He now lives on a $284 monthly disability check. 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversaries of Johnson's war periodically bring reporters and 
curiosity-seekers to Fletcher's home, and personal tragedy in 1992 thrust him 
again into the glare of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his second wife, Mary Porter Fletcher, were charged with murder in the 
poisoning death of their 3-year-old daughter, Ella Rose, and the attempted 
murder of 4-year-old Tommy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Ella died that January of what doctors diagnosed as a seizure disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 But her brother was hospitalized the next month, and examinations revealed he 
had ingested massive amounts of Darvon, a pain-killer. His sister's body was 
exhumed, and an autopsy showed an overdose of Elavil, an antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Fletcher later confessed to poisoning the children in hopes of ending 
marital strife, and of collecting $5,000 insurance policies. She cleared her 
husband and is serving a 25-year prison sentence for murder and first-degree 
criminal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, a Johnson program may have saved Tommy Jr.'s life three decades 
later. Teachers in the Head Start program here first called attention to his 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Jr., riding his bicycle one recent day in the Fletchers' yard, was 
friendly. The blond boy said his father was visiting relatives in Cincinnati, 
and he provided the telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher, weak from stomach and heart ailments, was reluctant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said enough on it," he said in a low, gravelly voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he was unable to break out of poverty, Fletcher replied slowly: "I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that he doesn't regret welcoming Johnson onto his porch. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Johnson was a good President," he said. "He was nice. He done a 
good favor to a lot of people."

U.S. EFFORT FOR EVERGLADES GIVES SUGAR GROWERS BITTER AFTERTASTE; FLORIDA: 
RUNOFF FROM THE CANE FIELDS IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DESTRUCTION OF WILDLIFE IN 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A pale sun glinted off of the knives of Jamaican cutters as they stooped to 
harvest sugar cane in a field of black, mucky soil. Walter Parker's pickup 
bounced across the field as he pulled up to check their progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my 27th crop," he said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker is director of agricultural operations for the U.S. Sugar Co., and he 
thinks of U.S. Sugar as his extended family. It has provided a comfortable life 
not only for Parker but for his father, uncle, brother, nephew and many of his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Life has been sweet for Florida's sugar growers for much of this century. But 
change is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles signed a bill backed by the Clinton 
Administration that requires sugar growers to spend $322 million over 20 years 
to clean up the water trickling from their farms into the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say runoff from the sugar cane fields is contributing to the 
destruction of wildlife in one of the most important and endangered ecosystems 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida bill was the first step in a comprehensive plan for restoration of 
the Everglades, one of the Administration's top environmental priorities. 
Ultimately, the plan could put much tougher restrictions on sugar growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a clear victory for the Everglades and the people of South Florida," 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said when the bill passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sugar cane growers took a dimmer view. "Our perspective on this basically 
is survival," said Robert Buker, a senior vice president at U.S. Sugar. "We're 
willing to make changes and pay money, but we want it in the context to allow 
farming to continue in the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's always been whispered is, they want our land," Parker said. "They 
can't afford to buy it from us, so they want to regulate it from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's sugar cane industry is crowded into a fertile crescent that hugs the 
southern shore of Lake Okeechobee. That puts it just upstream from the 
Everglades and smack in the middle of the debate over what to do about the 
nation's most famous swamp. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1840, Florida declared the area "wholly valueless" and asked Congress for 
help draining it. But the Everglades is now recognized as a unique biological 
resource. Not simply a swamp, it is a slow-moving, 50-mile-wide river, only 
inches deep in some places. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, a centenarian activist who did much to save the 
Everglades, called it a "river of grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Everglades National Park is the last stop for a vast sheet of water that 
begins just south of Orlando, bubbles slowly down the Florida peninsula and 
tumbles off the end into Florida Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the image of the Everglades as a place of little value persists. National 
Geographic magazine, which had never met a wilderness it didn't like, finally 
found something to complain about when it went to the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days I felt as though I were wandering through a museum stripped of its 
artifacts, which may explain why I was never romanced by this park," Alan 
Mairson wrote. After five weeks in Everglades National Park, Mairson said, he 
recalled "a handful of magic moments . . . but, frankly, there were far too 
few." 
</P>
<P>
 That image has complicated the job of environmentalists and researchers 
fighting to save the Everglades. It may partly explain why the Everglades has 
continued to suffer in recent decades, despite federal protection. 
Environmentalists say it is the most endangered ecosystem in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The dismantling of the Everglades began shortly after the turn of the century, 
when developers moved in with shovels and pickaxes to drain it. 
</P>
<P>
 Water was diverted to a growing urban population along the coast. The rich, 
organic soils south of Lake Okeechobee proved suitable for sugar cane. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar cane growers won favorable water rights from the state and its water 
agencies, and the sugar industry prospered. 
</P>
<P>
 But natural water flows to the Everglades were disrupted, and when the water 
did arrive it was rich in phosphorous and other nutrients it picked up on the 
farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Native vegetation, accustomed to surviving on the scant resources that occur 
naturally, was overwhelmed by cattails and other species that thrived on the 
surge in nutrients. And it is still happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Everglades is getting much less water, at the wrong place, and it's the 
wrong water," said James Webb of the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the United States sued Florida and its water agencies to force 
cleanup of the water reaching the Everglades. Substantial efforts had been made 
to reach a settlement before the Clinton Administration took up the cause. But 
pressure from the Interior Department was crucial in bringing about the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida legislation spells out the terms of settlement of that suit. The 
question now is whether the agreement spelled out in the Florida bill is a good 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill requires the construction of large artificial marshes that will be 
used to cleanse farm run-off before it arrives in the Everglades. The marshes, 
to be completed in 2003, will cost $465 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that, the sugar cane growers will be required to pay $230 million to $322 
million over the next 20 years, depending on how well they do in cleaning up 
the water before it reaches the water-treatment areas. The rest of the cost 
will be paid by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said the agreement pushes back deadlines too far, costs 
taxpayers too much and isn't tough enough on sugar cane growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think it got the job done," said Webb. "What it clearly does is 
delimit certain obligations of the industry. It doesn't do much else with 
similar clarity." 
</P>
<P>
 "In fairness to sugar, this deal does have some public benefits in it," said 
Thomas Martin, director of the Everglades campaign at the National Audubon 
Society. "They're going to send more Lake Okeechobee water south to the 
Everglades." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in 2003, however, the bill allows discharges of water containing up to 50 
parts per billion of phosphorous. That's still enough to do damage, Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have pushed for more money from the sugar industry so we can 
provide even less dirty water to the Everglades faster than this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt conceded that the Administration has more to do. "This problem is 
complex; it's going to take decades to solve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't save the Everglades unless we are going to find a permanent balance 
in an ecosystem that is being overburdened by the expansion of Miami, by 
intensive agriculture, by tremendous pressures on Florida Bay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sugar's Buker, meanwhile, is "happy to have it resolved, because this is 
a horrible issue and it just grinds us down." 
</P>
<P>
 The growers had lobbied for what he called "environmental peace," so they 
could carry on without fear of further challenges by environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have environmental peace, it looks like, for 12 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt didn't see it that way. In November, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
will present a report with its plan for restoration of the entire Everglades 
ecosystem, from Lake Okeechobee on down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of "environmental peace," Babbitt predicted "relative calm" for the 
next few months. "But it will only last until the report comes out," he said. 
"There is no question that the big issues were . . . touched upon only a little 
bit in the legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 If the sugar growers do have peace until then, Webb said, "they're going to be 
the only creatures in the Everglades, human or otherwise," that do.

GULF SOLDIER'S WIDOW GETS LIFE TERM FOR HIS INSURANCE SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The widow of a Gulf War soldier was sentenced to life in prison without parole 
Friday for plotting the 1991 murder of her husband to cash in on his insurance 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Cato Riggs, 25, who was convicted of first-degree murder June 8, received 
the mandatory sentence for conspiring with her brother to kill her husband, 
Anthony Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had argued that Riggs hired her brother, Michael Cato, to shoot 
her husband outside the couple's Detroit home just days after he returned from 
Saudi Arabia where he served as a Patriot missile crewman. 
</P>
<P>
 The national media initially portrayed the incident as a symbol of U.S. 
violence -- a combat veteran felled by a random drive-by shooting just days 
after returning from the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Riggs, who showed no emotion during the original trial, broke down during 
the sentencing, quoting from the Bible and pleading for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs had collected $150,000 in life insurance money after her husband's 
death, and prosecutors said she had planned to use the money to enter the drug 
trade.

ON ROBERTI, PLEASE GET YOUR TIMES STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * According to The Times, David Roberti's upset loss in the treasurer's race 
wasn't a victory for gun owners because Roberti had originally intended to 
retire and then chose to make his failed run for higher office in an 
unsuccessful attempt to thwart the "gun lobby" because of the April 12 recall 
election. The Times' argument is a fascinating non sequitur with no basis in 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
 It was reported as early as Aug. 8, 1993, that Roberti had said he would 
"probably" run for a state post rather than for the county Board of 
Supervisors. He announced his intention to seek the treasurer's office on Sept. 
24, 1993. The recall election wasn't even qualified for the ballot by the 
secretary of state's office until Jan. 24, 1994.

PROPOSITION 1A'S DEFEAT STILL PACKS A JOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Proposition 1A, which would have helped pay for earthquake-related repairs 
and the retrofitting of unsafe highway bridges and freeway arteries, was 
defeated for several reasons, none of which Paul Clarke mentions in his 
Commentary article of June 19. 
</P>
<P>
 He pins the blame on our neighboring counties. But most of the blame can be 
laid at the foot of Gov. Pete Wilson, who, shortly after the Jan. 17 
earthquake, did his imitation of former President George Bush by refusing to 
consider a temporary increase in the sales tax. This despite numerous public 
opinion polls detailing that a clear majority of Californians (in some cases 
over 60%) supported this avenue to pay for the quake, a la the Loma Prieta 
quake, and subsequent temporary sales tax increase to finance the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Wilson did not campaign for Proposition 1A, even though he favored 
the bond method of payment and it was his idea in the first place. Without the 
effective stewardship of President Bill Clinton, we Californians would be up a 
creek without a paddle, and our vital freeways would not have been reopened so 
quickly. This is called leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the public interest to pay for the quake with a one-fourth-cent 
temporary increase in the sales tax. Yes, it is regressive, but a least the 
earthquake would be paid for in the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters are not stupid, and they understand that the passage of bond measures 
to finance anything translates to paying more in the long run. It is like 
purchasing a $1,000 stereo with a credit card and taking many months to pay 
off; the $1,000 stereo becomes considerably more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this any way to pay for a natural disaster? Voters have said no. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Wilson had no contingency plan if the bond measure failed. Now, as 
the 1994-95 budget is moving through the Legislature, his own Finance 
Department has acknowledged making a $2.7-billion error in estimating cash 
flow, further complicating earthquake repair costs. In football, when a smart 
quarterback realizes the defense is prepared for the play called, he calls out 
an audible switch to another play. Gov. Wilson is the QB. Will he run, pass or 
punt? Or will he call an audible and show Californians in general, and 
Valleyites in particular, something he has not demonstrated -- leadership?  
</P>
<P>
 HOWARD COHEN 
</P>
<P>
 North Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite Paul Clarke's analysis, the "no" vote on Proposition 1A had 
absolutely nothing to do with apathy or lack of community with our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 A "no" vote meant simply that we do not want another bad measure to add to our 
debt, for which our children and grandchildren will be accountable. Our 
children and grandchildren will have disasters of their own, worse ones than we 
experienced on Jan. 17, as Mr. Clarke himself acknowledges. We need to pay for 
the damages, yes, but we need to pay as we go, not put off until tomorrow, when 
we will have to pay for new damage created by new disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that the voters, like myself, who defeated Proposition 1A are willing 
to accept higher taxes to pay for the damage from the Northridge quake, because 
that is the message we sent on June 7. This is the message we should be sending 
to our state representatives, who would like nothing better than to defer such 
tough decisions to us and to generations yet unborn.

ADVERTISING'S NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In your story on the lingerie shop's revealing billboard (June 16), Santa 
Clarita Mayor George Pederson expresses his sympathy with those residents 
opposed to it, but he states, "The First Amendment is still in place." 
</P>
<P>
 I am opposed to the First Amendment's being used as a tool to protect 
advertising.The billboard in question is a purchased communication with only 
one purpose behind it -- to sell. It is not an application of an inalienable 
right which the power of our freedom of speech is drawn from. It is a 
commodity. It should be held accountable to quality standards just like any 
other commodity (and regulated if necessary). 
</P>
<P>
 The shop has the responsibility not to offend the community it does business 
in. Mayor Pederson has the responsibility to represent the wishes of the 
residents of his town. The residents have the responsibility not to let our 
freedom of speech be trivialized as a defense for selling underwear.

CONCEPTUALIZING A CO-CREATIVE COMMONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The revitalization of downtown Canoga Park and downtown Reseda ("Communities 
Seek Ways to Save Dying Downtowns," June 6) could be pursued in a visionary way 
which also seeks the revitalization of people and families and a recharging of 
the public sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps several large storefronts in one or both of these towns could be 
combined to create a multiplicity of family-run, student- and youth-run, 
senior-run and ad hoc creative group-run limited-capital-investment 
"micro-enterprises" under one big roof or on one big block! 
</P>
<P>
 How about a cluster of small and tiny enterprises offering a great many of the 
practical and fun things people seek in the marketplace, a sort of 
hyper-multi-mini-micro mall of, by and for the people of these communities and 
the San Fernando Valley -- an exciting combination of public market, bazaar, 
food fair, meta-gallery, art park, festival, multi-thrift store, playground, 
day care center, home-made video studio and multi-cinema, public garden, 
homegrown amusement park, perpetual carnival and proto-typical experimental 
co-creative community (and maybe even potential world-class tourist attraction) 
of tomorrow, as much as possible designed, built and operated by groups of 
creative, entrepreneurial, public-spirited people from the community and the 
Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 A public-private partnership could be created to marshall resources and get 
this started, composed of local entrepreneurs, community leaders and community 
organizations, the schools and their students and whoever else wants to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, a two-year community participatory design phase should be 
inaugurated in Canoga Park or Reseda, in which community people in all the 
categories above have a chance to help create a vision and a plan for this 
"co-creative commons." This creative visioning-and-planning process would be 
educational, empowering and fun and worth doing!

THE DRIVE TO SAVE LIVES; BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITY JOIN HANDS AND HEARTS TO 
OFFER THE PUBLIC VACCINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The use of vaccinations to reduce disease -- especially in young children -- 
has been one of the great triumphs of modern medicine. In the 21-year period 
that began in 1960, for example, the number of cases of pertussis or whooping 
cough, nationwide, was reduced from 14,800 to less than 1,250. Since the late 
1980s, however, that success has been taken for granted. Along the way, the 
prices of these vaccines have also soared, leaving them out of reach of the 
poor. But the diseases have not gone away. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can forget, for example, the Los Angeles County measles epidemic that 
killed 40 children and left another 2,700 hospitalized between 1987 and 1991? 
That was a symptom of the fact that California does not rank highly in terms of 
the percentage of its 2-year-olds who are fully immunized. And Los Angeles 
County ranked next to last (at 40%) in a state ranking of counties based on the 
percentage of fully immunized 2-year-olds, just ahead of Tulare and Fresno at 
38%. The national percentage is 53%. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why we are pleased to applaud what may be the largest private sector 
immunization drive ever undertaken in the region. Over the course of the rest 
of the year, it will involve the sponsoring of more than 250 free clinics 
throughout the San Fernando Valley. Operation Immunization, as it has been 
dubbed, involves about 25 companies, foundations and community groups at an 
overall cost to them of about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank-based UniHealth America, which operates hospitals in the Valley, is 
spearheading the drive. The county's Department of Health Services is picking 
up the not inconsiderable cost of the vaccines, which are being administered 
for free in local schools and at some McDonald's restaurants. That's according 
to Greg Waskul, spokesman for the UniHealth America Foundation. Isabel Licon 
and her son, Irvine, pictured here, have already taken advantage of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the sites and schedules, you can call a toll-free, 
24-hour hot line at 1-800-618-6660. It just might save the life of your child.

POLICE HONOR IS MORE THAN PUBLIC RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for the story on the Police Appreciation Day sponsored by the 
Kiwanis Clubs of Glendale. However, the salute is intended for all the officers 
of the Glendale Police Department.If the clubs were to "recognize the good 
officers," each and every one would have to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 This day is set aside to honor those police officers who have risked their own 
lives to protect or save the life of another person or for heroism above and 
beyond the call of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program was started in 1988 by the Gateway Kiwanis Club of Glendale, 
it had nothing to do with "combatting negative publicity stemming from the 
Rodney King beating trials" as you wrote.

EDUCATION FUNDING COULD MEAN REAL PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In "Let's Teach Future Teachers the Right Way," (Valley Commentary, June 
12), professors Carolyn Ellner and Jan Mendelsohn complain that the Legislature 
keeps coming up with tasks for the teachers in dealing with their students, 
leaving no time for the education professors to deal with those tasks in the 30 
units that prospective teachers must take to receive their credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 At no place in this self-serving plea did the authors indicate just what it is 
they do to fill up those 30 units.In more than a quarter century of teaching in 
the public schools of California, with the exception of the professor in charge 
of supervising student teachers, I have never seen an education professor 
brighten the halls of a school, much less enter the classroom. None of my 
colleagues can recall seeing one either. 
</P>
<P>
 What we do recall -- old veterans as well as newer teachers -- is how useless 
and out-of-touch are the educational theory classes taught at the graduate 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll at least give the politicians the credit for knowing that the schools 
have some very serious problems and mandating legislation to try to deal with 
those problems. Now, if the Legislature would just carry this knowledge a 
little further and provide the funding to make that mandated legislation 
meaningful, then maybe we'll see some real progress in solving the problems.

'3 STRIKES' LAW GOOD ONLY FOR VIOLENT FELONS; LIFE FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS 
COULD FREE WORSE CRIMINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nickname given to each of the efforts designed to put career criminals 
behind bars for life comes from the old baseball term "three strikes and you're 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 California already has an overly broad "three strikes" law on the books that 
could create as many problems as it would solve. There is another ill-conceived 
"three strikes" measure on the November ballot. The Reynolds initiative, as it 
is termed, would mandate life imprisonment without parole for a third 
conviction on any one of several felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds is a bad idea because it would be embedded in the state Constitution 
and could be amended only by a two-thirds popular vote. But it is also a bad 
idea because it, too, is so broad that it could wind up pushing extremely 
violent felons out of prison. . .to make room for less violent and even 
nonviolent ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is that very important "you're out" part of all this that we are 
concerned with here. It's easy for politicians and for the rest of us to jump 
on the "lock 'em up and throw away the key" bandwagon, but something has to 
give if that happens. Somewhat neglected in the debate, for example, are two 
possible results and two alternatives. One is an immensely larger prison 
system, more costly as well by several billions of dollars. The other is a 
greatly expanded parole office system, where all the ex-cons must gather from 
time to time to prove that they are having a positive impact on society, or at 
least a non-impact. Just where are all those parole offices going to be, and 
who is going to even begrudgingly accept such facilities as neighbors? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, the recent brouhaha over the placement of an office in 
Sherman Oaks for some 4,100 parolees from state prisons who now live in the San 
Fernando Valley. News of the office's impending arrival mobilized the citizenry 
in Sherman Oaks, and their outrage prompted officials to cancel the decision. 
It turned out that the placement violated the state's own guidelines for 
keeping such facilities at least one-quarter of a mile away from schools and 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many more parole offices may be on the way, perhaps to a street near 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Well, let's consider the unenviable choices created by overly broad life 
imprisonment legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 As of March, there were at least 30,000 felons in California, all standing in 
their respective batters' boxes with two strikes against them and counting, all 
facing the potential of life imprisonment if they make one more bad swing.  
</P>
<P>
 The prisons also are jammed. Just 12 years ago, there were only 18,000 inmates 
in the entire California penal system. Today, that population stands at more 
than 120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It could cost as much as $21 billion if we decide to build new prisons for the 
estimated 109,000 additional inmates anticipated by the turn of the century. 
This is in a state where the economy continues to sputter like a car badly in 
need of higher octane fuel, a state where too few are willing to ante up even 
for schools or earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 And if we don't spend the money on new prisons, it will mean that more of 
those in prison now will have to be released to make room for those who will be 
incarcerated for life under "three strikes." That means busier parole offices, 
and more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar over that Sherman Oaks site won't hold a candle to that, not in a 
region where people are so litigious that they will go to war over the 
placement of a drive-thru doughnut shop around the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of all these unintended consequences. It's enough to make us take a very 
restrained approach to "three strikes." It is why we have supported versions 
that would reserve life imprisonment without parole only for repeat violent 
offenders. That's what we all want to accomplish. That is what is manageable, 
and affordable.

WHEN INK ON PAPER IS GOOD MEDICINE; AIDS RESOURCE HANDBOOK FOR PHYSICIANS 
NEEDED, BUT THERE'S A FINANCIAL CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surely, this far along into the frightening AIDS epidemic, just about every 
doctor would know what to tell people who test positive for the virus that is 
believed to cause it. Well, that was our assumption. So, when we heard that the 
Valley HIV/AIDS Center in Van Nuys was printing up a handbook on the subject 
for doctors and needed more funding for additional copies, we wondered whether 
it was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been educated. It's a darned good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Dr. Michael Gottlieb published the first paper identifying the 
existence of a new and fatal illness. It was later determined to be AIDS. About 
95% of the clients of the San Fernando Valley-based physician are AIDS 
patients. Gottlieb says that those who have just learned that they have the 
human immunodeficiency virus "are in need of a lot of immediate good advice. 
The average physician doesn't have the answers immediately at hand." 
</P>
<P>
 That's been the experience of Ana Vargas, a client outreach coordinator at the 
Valley HIV/AIDS Center. Most doctors provide HIV testing, she said, but many 
are not well versed in what to say when the tests are positive. 
</P>
<P>
 The handbook attempts to list all of the services available in the Valley for 
people with AIDS or HIV. It will also inform people about where to obtain legal 
services and mental-health counseling and tell them how to find support groups 
and food programs. Most importantly, perhaps, it will contain information on 
crisis-intervention hot lines and details about where to obtain medical 
treatment, such as a list of dentists who accept patients with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The group called AIDS Project Los Angeles already has a self-care guide on 
such important issues as how to maintain health insurance, where to obtain 
counseling and protecting one's rights as an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vargas group's handbook should be available by midsummer, so far only in 
English. But 35% of her clientele are Latino, some with limited English 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Latino community, this is too often seen still as a disease that only 
affects people who are gay or drug addicts. There is a lot of denial going on," 
Vargas says. "We need to reach this population." 
</P>
<P>
 Another $4,000 will be needed to have 10,000 handbooks printed in Spanish. 
It's money that Vargas' group does not have. Its goal of obtaining it and 
printing the handbooks is worthy of praise and support.

KOON AND POWELL DON'T BELONG IN ROGUES' GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * How dare you compare or even associate "the Rodney G. King beating" with 
some of the most horrific crimes in California, if not U.S. history? ("Rogues' 
Valley: The Life and Times of the Valley's Most Notorious Villains," June 15). 
</P>
<P>
 To categorize Laurence Powell and Stacey Koon with the demented, devious 
Charles Manson, Kenneth Bianchi, Angelo Buono and the like is completely 
unfair, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 One can argue all day long about the Rodney King incident and the subsequent 
convictions of Powell and Koon. As a Los Angeles police officer and a good 
friend of Larry Powell, I can confidently say that nobody met before, during or 
after rollcall and conspired to beat or kill anyone, black, white or otherwise. 
Whether they went too far and were outside of LAPD policy is certainly 
arguable, but criminal intent is not. It just didn't exist, and no evidence was 
ever presented in any court that it did.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; CALIFORNIA SWAMPED BY AN OUTDATED U.S. IMMIGRATION SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH SYBERT, Rich Sybert of Calabasas served as California director of 
planning and research from 1991 to 1993. He is the Republican candidate for 
Congress in the 24th District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comprehensive changes are needed in America's immigration policies, to assure 
a basic future for our children and people legally here, and to maintain a 
generous immigration policy over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 I have nothing against immigrants, nor do most people who are concerned about 
the current wave swamping California. I respect them for working hard. My 
father was an immigrant, as is my wife. My mother's parents fled Europe and ran 
a grocery store in Brooklyn. We should all be proud of our immigrant heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 For 200 years we have made large-scale immigration to this country work 
through a basic "deal" with each immigrant: Come to this country with all its 
freedom and opportunity, and in return give something back. Work hard, learn 
English and assimilate to the mainstream. In short, become an American. From 
this basic deal we have forged the most successful nation on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal is now breaking down under the weight of politically correct 
diversity and multiculturalism. And while diversity undoubtedly has its 
attractions, it also has limits -- Bosnia is diverse. At some point we have to 
leave our disparate origins behind us and focus on what unites us. 
</P>
<P>
 I studied this issue from 1991 to 1993 as the state director of planning and 
research. As executive director of the new California Center for Public Policy 
at Calabasas, I have just issued a comprehensive report detailing the impacts 
of growth and immigration on California. To make sure these impacts are 
positive, I favor a three-pronged approach: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Stemming illegal immigration 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, I favor: 
</P>
<P>
 * Using our armed forces to defend our border, as virtually every other 
country in the world does. 
</P>
<P>
 * A national computerized verification system for a tamper-resistant Social 
Security card so that employers can check legal status, akin to the systems now 
used for credit card verifications. 
</P>
<P>
 * Repeal of the part of the 14th Amendment that gives automatic citizenship to 
all children born on U.S. soil. This merely serves as a magnet for illegal 
immigrants, who now account for more than two-thirds of the births in Los 
Angeles County public and contract hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Congressional action to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plyler 
vs. Doe, requiring the states to pay for public education for illegal 
immigrants, and otherwise to terminate eligibility of illegal immigrants for 
government services other than emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Full-cost reimbursement to states such as California that bear a 
disproportionate share of the immigration burden. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Reforming our immigration laws 
</P>
<P>
 Successive liberalizations of our immigration laws in 1965, 1986 and 1990 have 
left the United States with a radically altered immigration regime and pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 We are now admitting large numbers (about 800,000 in the most recent 
statistical year) of largely very poor people with very little education, much 
less than in the past and almost entirely on the basis of extended family 
reunification rather than work skills. California receives two or three times 
its pro rata share of this flow, with corresponding cost impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants generally have excellent work and family values, and they do not 
exceed the welfare rates of long-term residents. But because they are 
unskilled, they generate relatively little in tax revenue, while consuming an 
inordinate share of public resources, particularly in the schools, due to large 
families. The conventional wisdom that overall immigration pays its way is 
simply wrong, particularly when it is a continuing phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Our economy has also changed. America should no longer want to compete on the 
basis of cheap, unskilled labor, unless it wants to achieve the living 
standards of Calcutta and Shanghai. Instead, we should be admitting more 
immigrants with skills, capital and education. 
</P>
<P>
 To adapt to this changing economy and still maintain a fair immigration 
policy, our immigration laws should significantly reduce overall numbers and 
should put emphasis on education and skills. Family reunification should focus 
on the immediate family. Our refugee and asylum laws should be sharply revised 
to admit only those truly in immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Addressing the social impacts 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's welfare and the goal of a racially and ethnically blind society 
require a renewed policy of assimilation for all immigrants. Without 
assimilation, the current mass of immigration, both legal and illegal, will 
threaten the cohesiveness of the United States as a society and we will become 
little more than a collection of angry tribes. To begin with, all government 
documents, including ballots, and perhaps the public airwaves, should be in 
English only. No taxpayer funds should be expended on bilingual education or 
indeed bilingual anything. To help them succeed, we must help immigrants learn 
English, our common language. 
</P>
<P>
 We still admit more people annually than the rest of the industrialized West 
combined. California in particular takes in one-third of all new arrivals, 
three times its proportionate share. However, as the world grows smaller and 
its population continues to increase, there are limits to what the United 
States can and should absorb. It cannot be responsible for every natural or 
social upheaval. It cannot take everybody. If we recognize this, we can still 
be both fair and open to a changing world and to ourselves.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; TRUTH FAR STRANGER THAN FICTION IN THE O.J. SAGA; THIS L.A. 
MYSTERY WRITER THOUGHT HE HAD 'SEEN IT ALL' AS A CRIME REPORTER AND 
CASE-HARDENED NOVELIST. THEN THE SIMPSON STORY BROKE WITH A PLOT TOO 
FAR-FETCHED TO MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Michael Connelly, a Times reporter from 1987 until 1993, 
won the Mystery Writers of America award for best first mystery of 1992 for The 
Black Echo. His latest novel is The Concrete Blonde. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a crime reporter for six years in Los Angeles, I never went wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 During my years with The Times I covered mass murders and serial murders 
(there is a technical difference), the heat-of-passion slayings, the crazy 
killings and the carefully planned murders. And this was only in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, it's a cynical view of society and life, but I made my living on 
murder and mayhem, and I came to believe that there was no better place than 
Los Angeles to be a police reporter. Miami, maybe. New York, never. It's all 
right here. 
</P>
<P>
 I was drawn all the way from Florida to write about crime here because I knew 
this was the place to be. And I wasn't disappointed. From cases that drew only 
a few paragraphs of attention to those put out on the front page, I covered 
more murders than I can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite memories was being on the phone with an LAPD detective, 
asking him the details -- mostly unpublishable -- about a particularly heinous 
sex slaying in North Hollywood, when I had to put him on hold as another call 
came in. It was the accused murderer, calling to tell me his side of the story. 
It is a creepy keepsake in my memory. The guy was later convicted, and I 
eventually stopped taking his collect calls from jail. I was tired of his 
protests of innocence and was on to other things, like the man who had his son 
help him bury his wife in concrete in the back yard in Reseda. After he was 
arrested, he used to call me too. A lot of them call. Los Angeles is that kind 
of place. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year I gave up true crime so I could make the stuff up. I left the crime 
beat so I could write mystery novels. These days I stay at home and write about 
a fictional Los Angeles and a fictional LAPD. I can plot my own murders, make 
them as complicated as I want and still have them solved by my own detectives 
by the last page. It's a nicely ordered world and it's fun and not as wearing 
on the feet, eyes and head. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, I thought I had seen it all and done it all as a police reporter in 
L.A. What else could this city show me about murder that I didn't already know? 
I wasn't surprised at anything anymore, and I had enough war stories to stick 
into 20 mystery novels. I thought I was home free. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the O.J. Simpson murder case came along. 
</P>
<P>
 As depressing and surprising as it is to see someone I admire fall from grace 
under the accusation of a brutally horrible set of murders, I have to admit the 
whole affair is also depressing because I can't do better. What I mean is, as a 
fiction writer I am constrained by the bounds of believability. True life is 
not constrained by anything. It's an irony I've been thinking about a lot these 
days. The Simpson case, from the shock of the murders to O.J.'s last run and 
arrest, is the golden example of the cliche that the truth is stranger than 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could have scripted the events of two weeks ago. They would have seemed 
laughably outrageous. If I had submitted a book proposal in May for a mystery 
novel about a sports hero and cultural icon who leads police on a nationally 
televised chase when accused of hacking his former wife to death, the pile of 
rejects would have been enough to cover the wall behind my computer. Now, maybe 
not. Now, when a book editor reads my stuff and suggests that some plot 
machination seems far-fetched, I'll say, "Yeah? And what about O.J.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the whole episode remains depressing. I lost a day of making it up on 
my computer while I watched the real thing unfold on TV. I guess it's the 
biggest murder case in L.A. since Robert Kennedy was gunned down. Maybe it's 
bigger, made so by the evolution of the media and the immediacy it now has, and 
the heightened fascination with celebrity in our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But I didn't miss being part of it. It's true that competition on a big story 
makes a police reporter's blood race. It's the best high I knew from the job. 
But even still, there's not a lot of joy in reporting on such things, about the 
low points of people's lives and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Like some cops, crime reporters burn out. I hit the wall and quit, and not 
even the crime of the decade, or maybe event of the century, made me want to go 
back to it. I'll be content to watch the Simpson case on Court TV. Now all I 
need to do is figure out a way to make fiction stranger than the truth.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; AREA PARKS ARE REFUGES FOR PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY WOHLGEMUTH, Sandy Wohlgemuth is conservation chairman of the Los 
Angeles Audubon Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things just aren't what they used to be. Remember when the great outdoors were 
free? No more. Want to park at Malibu Lagoon? Six bucks, even if you stay half 
an hour. Hiking on a trail in a county park to smell the flowers will cost you. 
Want to play softball in the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area? Get your wallet 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on here anyway? The city Department of Recreation and Parks says 
it has no money and must convert to pay-as-you-go, or else. Plans are in the 
works to hand over 56 acres west of Balboa Boulevard in the Sepulveda Basin to 
private concessionaires who will build 11 fee-charging softball fields and 
basketball courts. The city would get a percentage of the take. Meanwhile, 
backers of the proposed $125-million Arts Park project want to build a theater 
on the same parcel. Either way, another patch of scarce open space will 
disappear from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chatsworth Reservoir in the far West Valley are a 10-acre pond full of 
waterfowl in the winter and 1,300 acres of excellent wildlife habitat. Hundreds 
of Canada geese forage there every year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir itself has been empty for 25 years, and the prime flatland 
surrounding it has long been coveted by real estate developers. The city 
Department of Water and Power, reluctant to dispose of this property in the 
past, has recently expressed an interest in selling or leasing it. Recreation 
and Parks, meanwhile, has cooked up a blockbuster recipe for the land. Here are 
the ingredients: two nine-hole executive-style golf courses, a banquet room, a 
driving range, a restaurant, a recreation center, a miniature golf course and a 
video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes little imagination to guess what would happen to the deer, road 
runners and 190 species of birds that have been seen in Chatsworth if this 
massive development is realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neat ideas cooking on the front burners at Rec and Parks are a water 
slide in Hansen Dam Recreation Area and food stands and batting cages in a 
number of small city parks. All would collect fees. A future park in North 
Hollywood may include a miniature golf course and a mini-car racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 All city departments are crying the blues. A hiring freeze has been in effect 
for several years; employees who retire and quit are not replaced. Although 
Mayor Richard Riordan announced at a May community meeting in Woodland Hills 
that his proposed new budget actually increases funds for the Rec and Parks, 
the department insists it needs more money to carry on its business. 
</P>
<P>
 With a constantly growing population and more demand for facilities, this is 
probably true. But in its panic to cure the shortfall, the department is in 
danger of diminishing the value of its own property. ("We had to destroy the 
village in order to save it.") In a neighborhood park with baseball diamonds, a 
batting cage may not be a bad idea. But what about the kids who can't afford to 
pay to use it? And will the amount of money generated be worth the trouble? 
</P>
<P>
 In larger parks like Chatsworth and Sepulveda, the losses would vastly 
outweigh the gains. Parks like these are refuges for people as well as animals 
and birds. After a week of fighting freeway traffic and the stresses of work 
(and the headlines) we need the relief of open space with a view of the 
mountains. We need a chance to unwind, to walk a path through grass and trees 
away from the noise and right angles of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and the Rec and Parks director say turning parkland into 
fee-generating concessions is only a proposal, not a fait accompli. There will 
be public hearings and much discussion. City Councilman Hal Bernson, whose 
district includes Chatsworth, says of the plan there, "It's not going to fly. 
We have preserved the reservoir because it is a sensitive wildlife refuge. . . 
. It is basically one of the last open spaces we have left." 
</P>
<P>
 I hope he's right. If Rec and Parks reaches its goal, it may achieve a 
short-term cash bonanza. But it will have sold its assets, dipped into its 
capital. Genuine parkland will have been transformed into restaurants and sand 
traps, ball fields and parking lots. Once paved over and built upon, the wild 
habitat can never be recaptured. It is lost forever.

MEAT HANDLING BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that all packages of ground meat 
carry labels with instructions for proper handling and cooking. Among the 
guidelines to prevent harmful bacteria from causing illness are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep meat and poultry refrigerated or frozen.Thaw frozen meats only in the 
refrigerator or in the microwave. Do not leave meat standing at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep raw meat and poultry separate from others foods -- from the time you 
pick up the products in the supermarket, to the time you store them in the 
refrigerator, through preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wash all surfaces with hot water and soap that come in contact with uncooked 
meat and poultry including counters, cutting boards, utensils, sink basins and 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cook ground beef, pork, lamb and veal thoroughly or to an internal 
temperature of 160 degrees. The meat will no longer be pink when it is 
completely cooked. Cook ground poultry to an internal temperature of 165 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep hot foods hot after completing cooking or above 140 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refrigerate leftovers immediately or discard. DANIEL P. PUZO

PARTY LINE; IN A CHADO DA VIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Hollywood's hippest want to party these days, many head to Fred Eric's 
Chado Room, the private-party space at the restaurant Vida in Los Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, chef and owner of Vida, is known as a food punster -- there just aren't 
that many places these days that serve Okra Winfrey gumbo or Pop-I spinach 
soup. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's in the Chado Room where the real fun takes place. Reserved for a 
maximum of 18 for an entire evening, customers dine Japanese-, Western-, or 
even Middle Eastern-style. That means guests may find themselves sitting low to 
the ground on straw mats or in regular chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person ended up on the table dancing, taking her clothes off," says Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beastie Boy rapper Adam Horovitz (Adrock) and his wife, actress Ione 
Skye, threw a party for eight in the Chado Room, Eric filled the little drawers 
around the table with dry ice. On top of the ice sat bowls of cold Japanese 
pumpkin soup. The chef also added dry ice to the table centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the guests opened the drawers to eat their soup, all this foggy smoke 
came out," says Eric. "It looked great and gave the room a cool feel." Of 
course , the smoke gag was probably only coincidental. It had nothing to do 
with Horovitz and fellow Beasties making news last August when they lobbed a 
smoke bomb onto the crowded floor of the Troubadour rock club, sending fans out 
of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beastie group also ate Vietnamese spring rolls, octopus salad, grilled 
vegetables, and Eric's so-called Tra La La salad (a breaded artichoke heart 
filled with goat cheese). For dessert they ate cold Tibetan timbales (mango 
lassi sorbet), then munched on biscotti and sipped a hot Brazilian carnival 
mate tea served in gourds with metal straws. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eric, parties at the Chado are even more fun when he can get customers to 
play with their food. Often, he includes one course that requires guest 
participation. At one party he showed a group how to make the Japanese 
dumplings, gyozas . At another, guests grilled their own vegetables. "It's like 
roasting marshmallows," he says. "It's kind of that kindergarten thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These buttery biscuits are nothing like the flavorless Italian biscotti found 
at most coffeehouses. Be sure to allow them to cool thoroughly before storing 
in an airtight container or the biscotti may become soggy.  
</P>
<P>
 GRANOLA BISCOTTI 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/3 cups butter 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup dates, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups Granola 
</P>
<P>
 Cream butter and sugar in large mixing bowl until well blended. Add eggs 1 at 
time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and milk. Mix flour with 
baking powder in separate bowl and add to butter mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Add raisins and dates to Granola in work bowl of food processor and process, 
approximately 10 seconds, or until granola is texture of corn meal and nuts are 
still chunky. Add to biscotti mixture and mix until well blended. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion on floured board into 
12-inch cylinder, using palm of your hands. Pat gently. Slide both hands under 
each cylinder of dough and transfer to baking sheets. Bake at 325 degrees about 
30 minutes. Remove from oven. Let cool 2 minutes, then cut diagonally into 
1/2-inch thick slices. Place slices flat on baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees 
until slightly toasted, about 15 minutes. Store in airtight container. Makes 
about 5 dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Each biscotti contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 83 calories; 57 mg sodium; 16 mg cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 10 grams 
carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.08 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Granola 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups oatmeal 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup brown sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup bran flakes 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sesame seeds 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup almonds, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup canola oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
 Place oatmeal, brown sugar, bran flakes, flour, sesame seeds, pecans and 
almonds in bowl. Toss with canola oil and honey. Spread mixture on baking sheet 
and bake at 300 degrees 1 hour or until golden, turning every 10 minutes. Cool. 
Store in airtight container. Makes 5 cups.

SO THIS IS THE NEW USDA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's news of another E. coli outbreak linked to ground beef -- the same 
bacteria that caused hundreds of illnesses and four deaths on the Pacific Coast 
in 1993 -- came just as a Congressional watchdog agency accused the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture of foot-dragging in addressing the safety of the 
nation's meat and poultry supply. Chief among the complaints: USDA's inability 
to stem contamination rates in raw product. 
</P>
<P>
 The Government Accounting Office claims that USDA has made only "limited" 
improvements in its meat and poultry inspection program during the past 18 
months, the tenure of the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recent efforts have neither dealt with the (USDA) inspection system's 
inherent weaknesses nor fundamentally changed the system's predominant reliance 
on sensory (sight, smell and feel) inspection. . . . These methods cannot 
identify microbial contamination, such as harmful bacteria, which is the most 
serious health risk from meat and poultry," said John W. Harman, GAO's director 
of food and agriculture issues in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent outbreak last month, in which three children in San Luis 
Obispo County were hospitalized after eating ground meat, prompted USDA to 
reissue precautions about handling and cooking ground meat. Similar 
instructions have been required on all packages of ground meat since May 27 and 
were the result of USDA's reaction to the E. coli incidents on the Pacific 
Coast in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA's own data indicate that the annual cost of food-borne illness in the 
United States, in terms of medical expenses and lost productivity, ranges from 
$5.2 billion to $6.1 billion. More than half of the total is attributable to 
meat and poultry products. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also estimates that there are 80 million 
or more cases of food poisoning in this country each year. Exactly which 
commodities are responsible for most of these illnesses is unknown. More 
reliable data are difficult to accumulate because local health officials are 
often hard-pressed to investigate all cases of food poisoning. As a result, the 
source of an outbreak often goes undetected. The San Luis Obispo case, however, 
is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO's Harman reiterated a litany of failings that have yet to be corrected 
by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection System (FSIS). His most significant 
charges, made in testimony recently before a Senate Agriculture subcommittee in 
Washington, include the following points: 
</P>
<P>
 * FSIS methods waste resources because they rely on visual inspection methods. 
Widespread laboratory testing for harmful bacteria in raw meat should be 
implemented instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Animal diseases for which the meat inspection system was originally designed 
(87 years ago) have been eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
 * The FSIS signature hands-on inspection techniques virtually ensure that 
contamination is spread from one carcass to another. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although FSIS has known for 15 years that microbial contamination was a 
serious problem, it has not routinely performed microbial tests of equipment 
surfaces or raw products. Nor does it require industry to perform such tests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Without microbial tests, FSIS does not know where in the production and 
processing cycle microbial contamination is most likely to occur, or what types 
of bacteria are prevalent and at what levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dixon, USDA deputy press secretary, disagreed with the GAO 
characterizations and said the Clinton Administration inherited a meat 
inspection system that was in need of a drastic overhaul. She said progress has 
been made in all areas said to be deficient by GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Clinton Administration's innovations in the past 18 months include 
unannounced USDA inspections at slaughter and processing plants with 
historically poor sanitation practices, enforcing zero tolerance for fecal 
contamination on red meat, development of a zero tolerance policy for poultry, 
cooking and handling instructions on 15 billion packages of ground meat and 
poultry a year, and development of rapid tests for microbiological hazards that 
will be instituted at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are bringing the system into the 20th and 21st centuries," Dixon said. "We 
are developing meat technologies that should have been developed years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 GAO did credit USDA for its public information efforts, such as the cooking 
and handling labels, but said that education alone will not eliminate food 
poisoning outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the E. coli outbreak of January, 1993," Harman said, "the nation has 
experienced an increase in the number of incidents of food-borne illnesses 
caused by meat contaminated with the same E. coli bacteria."

AMERICAN CHEF; CUISINE AND MOI  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAVRIL LOURIE, Lourie is currently chef de cuisine at the Los Angeles 
catering company Along Came Mary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun rises over Marseille. I am terrified. At 8:30 a.m., I am to be in the 
kitchen of Le Petit Nice, where I, a young American cook with spotty French, am 
about to begin work. Or, to be exact, I am about to begin the French rite of 
passage for cooks, the stage . All I know about my new life as a stagier , or 
apprentice, is that the hours will be long and the pay, well, zero. It's 
possible that I could spend most of my two-month stay in the basement peeling 
potatoes before I'm allowed in the kitchen, where the chef might very well 
crack me across the head for any culinary violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Why put myself through such an ordeal? At 15 I entered the restaurant business 
and realized right away that to excel I'd have to follow the path of cuisine : 
work my way up from the bottom, all the while gathering knowledge, honing 
skills, kissing a bit of proverbial butt and, ultimately, studying with the 
masters when -- and if -- the time should ripen. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years later, with a smattering of French in my repertoire, I'm as ready 
as I'll ever be. Oddly, the terror abates as the hour approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Practicing my opening lines in French, I thread my way through the labyrinth 
of cobblestone and pastel back streets that are Marseille. In due time I reach 
Le Petit Nice, the city's only two-star restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Its white stucco balconies float over the royal blue Mediterranean. Through 
large windows, the stainless-steel and the white tiles of the kitchen are 
visible, creating a fishbowl effect. I enter. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is empty and silent save for the low hum of the ice box. A man dashes 
by, but before I can speak my opening lines, he disappears. After 15 
anxiety-ridden minutes, I spot a tall cook wearing whites and sporting a waxed 
handlebar mustache. I take a breath and recite my lines: " Je m'appelle Gavril 
Lourie. Je suis arrive pour fair un stage. "  
</P>
<P>
 He barely stops what he's doing, glances up at me, and says, "How's your 
English?" 
</P>
<P>
 Caught off guard, I reply, "Pretty good, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you're American!" he says, introducing himself as Uwe, a German employed 
at the restaurant as a poissonnier , or fish chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Great. I had come to France to work and speak with French chefs, and first 
thing I know, I'm speaking English with a German. This must be Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Down in the changing room Uwe informs me that, contrary to the usual practice 
in most American restaurants, in France all cooks are responsible for buying 
and cleaning their own whites. In other words, it's going to cost me an 
additional $100 to work for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The coat, Uwe says, loaning me one of his, has to be buttoned up on the right 
and all the way to the top, no American informality allowed. OK.  
</P>
<P>
 After a quick tour of the kitchen, he puts me to work for a few hours 
julienning cucumbers and zucchini. Although I have brought my own knives, Uwe 
makes me use a giant German knife. Uptight about making mistakes, I do the job, 
it seems, too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relax, kid," says Uwe, "they don't have to be so perfect!" 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the corner of my eye, I start to notice the other cooks going about 
their duties and am surprised by the international makeup of the kitchen -- 
Japanese, English, German, Italian. The staff lunch is eaten in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's godawful. Cold mixed vegetables from a can. Cheap, fatty salami. A 
salad of unwashed, undressed chicory. Craziest of all, coffee and soda are 
forbidden to the cooks. Some restaurants, I've heard, pay their stagiers , and 
some, it is rumored, are even fed well. Not so here. Perhaps this is the famous 
French stinginess?  
</P>
<P>
 At 3 o'clock, after the counters are scrubbed, the stoves cleaned and the 
floors mopped, we all go downstairs to change. In my naivete I ask, "Are we 
done for the day?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Ha!" they all laugh. "Be back at 6." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus I learn that my workday begins at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 11:30 p.m., six 
days a week, Sundays off. By having everyone work six days a week, the owners 
avoid the expense of a second shift. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 on the dot, I meet Pascal, the strapping young Provencal who, as 
sous-chef, runs the kitchen in the absence of the chef. He shakes my hand with 
a fleeting glance of acknowledgment and then nods back to the chopping block, 
where I concentrate on not seeming overzealous -- I don't slice the vegetables 
too perfectly. I survive Day One. 
</P>
<P>
 Famous for elevating the seafood of Marseille to the level of haute cuisine, 
Le Petit Nice attracts an eclectic mix of international elite, from Neil 
Armstrong to Catherine Deneuve. American executives descend from helicopters to 
consume lavish meals, only to vanish four courses later in a whir of rotors.  
</P>
<P>
 All of the tall glass windows in the dining room are filled with the sight of 
the Mediterranean, the notable exception being the one on the far right that 
looks out onto the island prison of the Count of Monte Christo, the Chateau 
d'If. The service is so swift and unobtrusive that the customer almost feels as 
if the sea is magically offering its bounty directly. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the dining room doors, however, I am up to my elbows in 
fish blood. Scales fly into my hair. The low-tide stench of fish guts adheres 
to my hands and nostrils. For the sake of speed, fingers are the tools 
recommended for the removal of the unforgiving gills, which can do nasty things 
to your hands. Next, with a pair of needle-nosed pliers, I must remove, one by 
one, the copious, tiny bones from a mountain of rouget fillets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite everything I had envisioned, on Day Two I am put in sole charge of 
cooking the fish that will actually be served to paying customers. Pascal, the 
sous-chef, barks out orders. My brain swims with foreign fish names -- loup de 
mer , rascasse , morue . . . . I make as many mistakes as there are varieties. 
I am scolded. It seems I am having trouble getting the hang of the proper 
French way to prepare fish. They like their fish rare and their vegetables well 
done, just the opposite of most Americans. With every fish I cook, Pascal bangs 
his fist on the table and mutters, "Too cook, too cook!" 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the pieces of equipment in the kitchen, the sous-vide , or vacuum 
sealer, is one of the most unexpected -- and attractive. It is a suitcase-sized 
box with a windowed lid and a few controls on the outside. After a morning of 
fish cleaning, the fillets are wrapped in butcher's paper and placed in a 
special plastic bag. One end of the so-called cryovac bag is connected to a hot 
sealing rod, while the other is fitted around a tube. With a great whoosh the 
air is sucked out of the bag, which is sealed at the same time. The bags of 
fish are iced down until served.  
</P>
<P>
 As the order is called by the chef, I pull out a bag of fish from the ice, cut 
out a portion and voila ! The fish is as fresh as the moment it was cut -- 
technology to accommodate a most earthly delight. 
</P>
<P>
 On my third day, the chef de cuisine, Gerald Passedat, returns from a trip to 
Italy. It was his grandfather who founded Le Petit Nice in 1917. Lean, 30 years 
old, described in the French guidebook Gault-Millaut as a playboy, Passedat has 
a classic Gallic nose and an aloof air about him. His lordly manner makes the 
atmosphere in the kitchen even more tense, if that's possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The stagiers nobly break that tension by cracking jokes and knocking off each 
other's toques by hurling pieces of wet bread. After our usual dismal lunch, 
the chef asks for a small plate of diced raw sea bass for his chat. " Chat 
-shimi," I pun to Akiheko, one of the Japanese stagiers.  
</P>
<P>
 Out front, a customer orders lobster. The maitre d' takes the order sheet and 
presents the dupe to the chef, who calls out " Homard !"  
</P>
<P>
 That's my signal. I grab the keys and a pan, race out back, down the alley, 
through the restaurant garden, and into the garage where I fumble for the 
lights (the French have a very different sense of where such fixtures should be 
placed). In the room that houses a tankful of lobsters from Brittany, I try to 
fish out a nice one.  
</P>
<P>
 But the lobsters aren't cooperating. They keep jumping out of the long-poled 
net back into the tank. Meanwhile, back in the kitchen, I know the orders are 
pouring in. Finally, I am able to snare one of the crafty crustacea, and I zip 
back through the garden and into the kitchen. I throw the thing alive and 
kicking onto its back, hack it in half, pluck out its heart and douse its flesh 
with olive oil, Provencal garlic and thyme. Its muscles twitch as they are 
sprinkled with salt and pepper.  
</P>
<P>
 At a nod from Passedat, into the oven it goes. Once-cooked, twice-dressed, 
ready to be served. A punch in the shoulder and a wink tells me that at last 
Pascal is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Dejeuner is supposedly French for lunch. But the American experience of a diet 
Coke and a frozen yogurt does not even remotely resemble the daily occasion 
that takes place on the Continent. In France, commerce and trade politely but 
definitely are brought to a halt so that the French citizenry might indulge in 
its inalienable right to an unencumbered, uninterrupted mid-day repast. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Passedat's jowly basset hound meanders through the kitchen and flops 
himself down in the most inconvenient of places. Passedat yells and kicks him 
freely, but when meal time comes around, it is the dog who is served steak, 
while we get cheval , horse meat. The French adore their pooches, and this 
accounts for the omnipresence of chefs' best friends in the kitchens and dining 
rooms of the country's great restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 While this may seem unhygienic to an American, the French stove is a shining 
monument to cleanliness. Made of the highest-quality steel -- usually reserved 
for F-16s and Trident subs in this country -- it is polished and buffed twice a 
day with special sandpaper from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 While American cooks eat standing up at their cutting boards, a knife in one 
hand, lunch in the other, here we retire outside for nearly an hour of la 
digestion -- bad as it is -- on the rocks by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a sign in the kitchen that reads Vous avez choisi un metier noble -- 
"You have chosen a noble profession." 
</P>
<P>
 In France there is an unmistakable pride in being a cook. Food does not simply 
serve to fulfill a bodily need; it was here that it was raised to the level of 
art, with all the endless pursuit of perfection that implies. 
</P>
<P>
 But that "nobility" also entails personal sacrifice, as when the chef decides 
to smoke some sea bass and orders all the windows shut. One of the stagiers , 
David, has been feeling queasy all day. He now turns blue and has to run 
downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's David?" asks the chef a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downstairs. He's very sick." replies a stagier . 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he dead?" the chef queries sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then tell him to get up here and plate the lamb." The chef's tyranny is 
full-on. David plates the lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 There are breaks in the tension and routine. One day I get to go to the market 
with the chef's father, Jean-Paul, a thick-set man with graying hair who used 
to run the kitchen but now spends most of his time out front with the 
customers. Run exclusively for restaurants, the market is in a desolate 
industrial zone surrounded by Arab tenements. Some of the vendors are grilling 
sausages and drinking red wine.  
</P>
<P>
 I load our order -- fennel, eggplant and thyme -- into our van according to 
Jean-Paul's exacting instructions for safeguarding the produce. The aroma of 
Provencal tomatoes is intoxicating. In America, au contraire , tomatoes are 
seen and not smelled. It occurs to me that the produce is the true star of 
Provencal cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 I am the only American in the kitchen, and I take more than my share of heat 
when my fellow Americans out in the dining room are gauche enough to order 
"just a salad" or ham and eggs when they come all the way to this two-star 
French restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans have no appetite, they don't know how to eat!" says the chef with 
his fist in the air, glaring at me. I have no reply. 
</P>
<P>
 But I try to think of one while preparing frogs' legs, which come to the 
kitchen neatly plaited by the dozen on thin sticks of wood. They are delivered 
on ice, but at room temperature they smell like the reptile section of a pet 
store. Detaching the feet and hips is done with a paring knife; the work is 
delicate, time-consuming, tedious. I am at a low point, feeling unappreciated 
and, worse, unaccepted. I grumble insults at the frogs' legs, which I then 
flour lightly and saute in goose fat and oil. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long day, Akiheko and I retire to a local bar for a bottle of the 
eternal Japanese elixir, Coca Cola.  
</P>
<P>
 Pascal, the sous-chef, dispels the gloom by announcing that he is taking a 
leave of absence to help with the harvest on his family's farm near Avignon. He 
invites the entire kitchen there for a grand Provencal feast. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Sunday morning our caravan -- a Citroen, a VW bug, a Yamaha 
motorcycle -- streaks down the autoroute at 200 km (120 miles) per hour. At the 
farm, Pascal's parents greet us warmly, three kisses instead of the usual two. 
While Pascal cooks, we sip pastis and eat potato chips. Then the 25 of us go 
outside and sit down at a long table under the trees. There are dogs, chickens, 
piglets, goats and children running everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I slip away from the conversation and find Pascal cooking his version of 
paella on a camping stove. He shows me some tricks and lets me in on a few 
secrets. Then he moves about the table ladling out steaming saffron-flavored 
rice heaped with rabbit, squid, shellfish and peas. We drink the family's 
homemade wine out of plastic Vittel bottles. A tarte aux pommes follows the 
cheese. Native produce may be the star of Provencal cuisine, but the home 
kitchen is its brilliant agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all my lessons are so easy. Back in the kitchen a few days later, Uwe 
offers me a slice of sauteed lamb's testicle.  
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks, but no thanks," I say politely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a cook, you taste it, you eat it." He's right. I'm a cook. I taste it. 
Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
 And if I had any last doubts about being accepted as a cook in that kitchen, 
they are washed away on my last day, when I hear Uwe say, "Excuse me, Mr. 
Lourie." I look up as a bucket of water is poured over my head. It is a French 
custom to soak anyone who is leaving the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 I decide to give the tradition an American update and a few minutes later 
catch Uwe off guard with a bucketful in return. All cooking comes to a stop and 
the whole kitchen goes berserk as a full-fledged water fight ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Uwe and most of the staff drag me kicking and screaming to the dish 
sink, where I am dunked into the filthy water and a torrent of tomato sauce is 
poured over my head. Then everybody laughs and cheers at the spectacle of my 
baptism. I smile too, licking the tomato sauce from the corners of my mouth. It 
could use a little salt. 
</P>

 Bouillabaisse is known throughout the world as a grand classic of French 
cuisine. The mere mention of the word conjures images of quaint old sea towns 
and the salty old men who work there, steaming sterling platters of the sea's 
bounty brought to the table in elegant French bistros brimming with gleaming 
brass and pressed white linen. But I found that closer to the truth was a dish 
of boiled fish and somewhat glamorized leftovers. In this version, the fish and 
shellfish are served with just a little of the broth in which they cooked. 
Also, the potatoes are cooked separately. You can, however, cook the potatoes 
with the fish and shellfish and serve the dish as a soup. I actually like it a 
little better this way (you can take the Yankee out of the States . . . ), 
though that cooking and serving method is very much taboo in the city of 
Marseille.  
</P>
<P>
 Note: In France, the fish for bouillabaisse would be slightly different. 
Rascasse, or scorpion fish, for instance, would be considered essential in 
Marseille. But since it isn't available here, try Pacific red snapper.  
</P>
<P>
 BOUILLABAISSE 
</P>
<P>
 4 large leeks  
</P>
<P>
 2 yellow onions 
</P>
<P>
 4 carrots 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 bunch celery 
</P>
<P>
 1 celery root 
</P>
<P>
 2 fennel bulbs 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds Roma tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1 monkfish tail 
</P>
<P>
 2 small Pacific red snappers 
</P>
<P>
 2 red mullets 
</P>
<P>
 1 small porgy 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound sole fillets 
</P>
<P>
 1 small striped bass 
</P>
<P>
 1 (750-milliliter) bottle dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped basil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon saffron threads 
</P>
<P>
 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
 Water 
</P>
<P>
 Rouille 
</P>
<P>
 Begin 1 day before serving. Trim and clean leeks (removing green part), 
onions, carrots, celery, celery root, fennel and tomatoes, reserving trimmings. 
Cut vegetables in 1/4-inch dice. Store separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Gut, but do not bone fish. In large pan, marinate monkfish, snapper, mullet, 
porgy, sole and striped bass overnight in reserved vegetable trimmings, 1/2 
bottle white wine, 1 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon thyme, parsley and basil. 
</P>
<P>
 Next day, in large non-reactive stock pot, saute diced vegetables, except for 
tomatoes, in 1 cup olive oil until they begin to soften. Add garlic and 
remaining 1 tablespoon thyme, then tomatoes and simmer 5 minutes. Add remaining 
1/2 bottle of wine and saffron threads. 
</P>
<P>
 Boil and reduce to half, add water until there is enough space for fish and 2 
quarts liquid. Simmer 10 minutes, remove 2 quarts liquid and reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove fish from marinade. Pat fish dry with paper towels. Add whole fish to 
pot in order of size, largest on bottom, closest to heat. Bring to boil. Add 
remaining 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil and cook until done. 
</P>
<P>
 While fish is cooking, boil potatoes in reserved broth. When done, keep warm 
in broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve fish whole on warmed platter with potatoes on side. Carefully skin and 
bone fish and divide among warmed shallow soup bowls. Divide potatoes among 
bowls and then ladle over just enough fish broth to barely cover. Garnish with 
1 tablespoon Rouille smeared on baguette slices. Makes 10 servings.

 Fishing for those lobsters, I felt like the centurion who threw Christians to 
the lions. The tomato sauce is a recipe of mine that combines Mediterranean 
flavors with a Mexican technique I learned from Santiago Oliveras, a very 
talented chef at Along Came Mary.  
</P>
<P>
 HOMARD PROVENCAL 
</P>
<P>
 4 (1 1/2- to 2-pound) live Maine lobsters  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil  
</P>
<P>
 Juice 1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Charred Tomato Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Firmly hold lobster on back and, using large chef's knife, split in half 
lengthwise. (If preferred, lobster may be quickly killed by making cut just 
behind head to sever spinal cord.) Remove heart (in hard sac approximately 
quarter of way back from head). Crack open claws. 
</P>
<P>
 Place lobsters in shallow baking dish. Season to taste salt and pepper. Add 
thyme and scatter garlic on top. Pour olive oil and lemon juice on top. Bake at 
425 degrees 10 to 12 minutes until meat is just done. Check claws and tail. 
Serve immediately with Charred Tomato Sauce. Makes 4 servings.

 The method that follows may sound a bit troublesome, but it is really just 
another job performed daily by thousands of chefs. Be careful not to overcook 
these delicate appendages. Their flavor is a cross between chicken and fish -- 
very appropriate considering they are amphibians. The two very different sauce 
recipes represent the classic and the more modern Provencal approaches.  
</P>
<P>
 FROGS' LEGS WITH TWO SAUCES 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Cut off feet and pelvis from frog legs. Remove any remaining skin and tendons 
at ankles. Cut in half at knees and scrape down meat away from knees to form 
small "handles" of bone. Pat dry with paper towels. Season lightly to taste 
with salt and pepper. Dredge in seasoned flour before cooking so flour will be 
dry as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat saute pan, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Cook until 
butter foams. Add frogs' legs, being careful not to overcrowd. Cook, turning as 
they begin to brown. Reduce heat. Cover and cook 2 more minutes. Do not 
overcook. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove legs from pan and place on paper towels to drain. Keep warm. Repeat as 
often as necessary to cook all legs.

 "Loupolong" was my nickname at Le Petit Nice because of the sheer quantity of 
fish I prepared. To bone this fish the way I did is quite difficult, requiring 
cutting along both sides of the spine all the way down to -- but not through -- 
the belly, snipping out the backbone, then carefully removing the pin bones. 
Foil supports keep the fish upright during cooking . Then the fish is served 
with its back open and filled with a bounty of Provencal vegetables, topped 
with glimmering oily black truffles. Spoon the sauce on the platter surrounding 
the fish. A simpler approach would be to saute two pounds of lightly floured 
sea bass fillets in butter and serve with the vegetables arranged on top.

 Once at a bed and breakfast in the Napa Valley, the woman of the house gave us 
a breakfast of popovers stuffed with whipped cream and raspberries. She'd 
picked the berries five minutes before. I cast sheep's eyes at her hedge. It 
ran the length of the house against a white picket fence, was three feet deep, 
and ablaze with red berries. It was all I could do not to race out there and 
gorge myself till I fell over in a frenzy.  
</P>
<P>
 Out-of-hand, off-the-cane -- that's the way to eat raspberries. They weren't 
meant to travel. Boxed and chilled and bumped and thumped, the morsels suffer. 
There's nothing in the garden that tastes better warm from the sun than a fat 
raspberry. Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 I joyously eat raspberries as offered by Mother Nature. But many of the 
wonderful things to eat in this world eaten with raspberries are transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple figs and red raspberries with powdered sugar and cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Poached nectarines with pureed raspberries, or peaches with raspberries -- add 
ice cream, and it's a Melba. 
</P>
<P>
 Raspberries drizzled with or dipped in chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 A pool of sweetened raspberry puree around a plop of fresh cream cheese 
lightened with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Raspberries with orange liqueur. Or cherry liqueur. Or raspberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Red raspberries and red currants -- simmered and sweetened, in a bowl 
surrounded by crustless slices of bread, weighted and chilled, then unmolded 
and garnished with fresh berries and cream: rosy red summer pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 Raspberries giving their warmth to vinegar -- berries steeped in it, strained 
out, then the vinegar sweetened -- delicious splashed over everything from 
leafy salads to roast chicken to fruit ices. 
</P>
<P>
 Red raspberry jelly with a scented geranium leaf in the jar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most memorable raspberries I've had were with whipped cream and broken 
pieces of meringue. You sweep a spoonful into your mouth -- there's the cloud 
of cream, then the crunch of meringue, then the sweet sharp seedy velvety 
ribbon of raspberry.  
</P>
<P>
 You must grow them.  
</P>
<P>
 There are two sorts of raspberry plants. Those yielding small crops in July 
and then again in September are called everbearers. Heritage is a delicious and 
widely adapted favorite of this type. Those that bear one big crop right around 
now are called July bearers -- Cherokee is one of these. It was developed to be 
especially tolerant of summer heat, a wise choice where summers are hot and 
winters cold. In areas where there is little winter chill, grow Bababerry, a 
tasty everbearer. 
</P>
<P>
 Everbearers are increasingly popular. You can let some plants crop twice, and 
the rest you can force to give one fine crop in autumn: run through the canes 
with a lawnmower after the leaves fall or before growth starts in spring.  
</P>
<P>
 Raspberries do best in full sun in a coolish humid climate. Elsewhere, they 
need extra TLC. In torrid heat, give them partial shade and mulch deeply to 
keep the soil cool -- one of the most fruitful patches I've ever seen was in 
summer-hot Topanga Canyon. Although raspberries come in red, purple, gold and 
black, the reds are heaviest bearing, most heat-tolerant, and least bothered by 
disease. Once you've grown reds, try your hand at golds, then the other colors. 
(But unless you have virus-free stock, don't grow reds and blacks together -- 
sometimes reds carry a virus that kills blacks. Generally, if you can grow 
grapes and blackberries, you can grow red raspberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil must be rich in humus, well-drained, and kept constantly moist. 
Raspberries can't flourish in clay, so add compost, well-rotted manure or peat, 
and buckets of earthworms. Don't plant raspberries where potatoes, tomatoes, 
eggplants or peppers have grown recently, and don't grow these crops near your 
raspberries -- they have diseases in common. The only time my potato crop got 
sick was when they grew next to the raspberries.  
</P>
<P>
 Red raspberry plants are ornamental. In the landscape, when in leaf, a hedge 
is a tall fountain of green -- undersides of leaves are lighter, so with the 
sun behind them, they're iridescent. Although canes will be cut down or bare 
part of the year, their reddish brown catches the light. You might place 
raspberries at the back of the border -- they're a good barrier plant because 
of their thorns. But be vigilant in pulling up suckers. In good soil, you can 
set plants about two feet apart in rows four to six feet apart. Although I 
rarely like toy soldiers of rows in the garden, rows make prickly picking easy. 
Sturdy canes will support themselves, so you don't have to deal with posts and 
wires (although if you want to, you can train vines vertically this way). A 
deep, heavy mulch keeps the soil cool and moist in summer and protects the 
canes in cold winters -- they're very hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds diving for ripe berries before harvest have been our only problem. We're 
largely generous and philosophical, trading our berries for their songs. But 
when the bluebirds, purple finches and black-headed grosbeaks grow as ravenous 
as I for raspberries, I throw netting over the bushes, though they can peck 
through it. The birds scold from the quince trees. I am in their bad books. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, you can plant in fall, late winter and early spring -- 
put a note on your calendar. It's wise to get canes that are certified 
virus-free -- you'll save yourself trouble. The good news is that plants last 
10 to 15 years. The bad news is that it takes two seasons before canes are in 
full sway. The best news is that these plants provide a lifetime supply of new 
canes -- dig up suckers and replant them for new bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each plant will yield an average of a quart of berries per season. If you'd 
like to taste berries as they were meant to be tasted but a patch would be 
impractical, grow a couple of plants in a half barrel. You can embellish it 
with baby lettuces and rosy hues of stock and give it model care. For the fine 
points about raspberrying (which you need to know for maximum yield), consult a 
basic garden book or the pamphlet "Berries, Rasp & Black," by Louise Riotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Pick berries when their color is richer and deeper than most around them, and 
when they pull easily off the cane. Do not rinse, and eat at once. Raspberries 
from the market must be rinsed, I suppose, but be quick about it.

 As lavish as it is, the following dessert is versatile. It can be served at 
the end of an elegant dinner in broad wine glasses, or passed in pottery bowls 
to end a rustic supper.  
</P>
<P>
 To hold their crunch, meringues for this recipe must be dense and the dessert 
served immediately. Since they keep well, the recipe makes more than twice as 
many meringues as you'll need (you may cut the recipe in half). All elements 
can be prepared in advance. This is my version of a dessert I ate years ago at 
the Box Tree restaurant in New York City.  
</P>
<P>
 RASPBERRIES AND MERINGUES IN CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups fresh ripe raspberries 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Whipped Cream 
</P>
<P>
 12 (2-inch) Meringues, cut into bite-size pieces 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve 6 perfect berries. Mash remaining berries in bowl with fork about 1 
hour before serving. Blend in sugar to taste (not too much). 
</P>
<P>
 At serving time, fold raspberry puree into whipped cream until blended, then 
blend in Meringue pieces. Turn at once into chilled dishes and top with 
reserved berries. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meringues 
</P>
<P>
 2 extra-large egg whites, warmed in shells in hot water before separating 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Place egg whites in bowl and beat with mixer on medium speed with cream of 
tartar until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Add granulated sugar, beating on 
high speed, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla extract and beat 1 more minute.  
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle powdered sugar over bowl. Blend in with rubber spatula, about 12 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately drop mixture in rounded 1-tablespoon portions, mound abouts 1 inch 
apart, onto large baking sheet covered with foil, shiny-side-down. Bake on 
center rack of 225-degree oven 1 hour. Turn oven off, prop door open 1 inch and 
let meringues stand 4 hours to overnight. Meringues will be thoroughly crunchy, 
although they may be cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Where air is dry, store in cool place. Where air is damp, store in tightly 
closed tin. Meringues keep for several weeks. Makes about 28 (2-inch) 
meringues. 
</P>
<P>
 Whipped Cream 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
</P>
<P>
 Beat cream, sugar and vanilla extract in bowl until firm. Do not over-beat. 
Cream may be covered and chilled 3 to 4 hours. Before serving, whisk briefly to 
reblend.

SEASONAL FRUIT; THE BERRIES OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By SHARON KRAMIS, Kramis is the author of the newly released Berries: A Country 
Garden Cookbook (Collins Publishers: San Francisco) from which this article is 
excerpted.

<TEXT>
<P>
 School is out for the summer and strawberries signal the beginning of berry 
season. I pack a picnic lunch, load my family in the car and head for the 
you-pick fields. 
</P>
<P>
 I caution everyone not to pick as many berries as last year, reminding them 
how long it took me to clean and make jam out of last year's batch. I say this 
every year, and every year when we reach the fields, the berries are such a 
bright red and so good to eat that we end up picking more than we can possibly 
eat in a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later we carry our berry flats to the weighing stand, pay up and 
drive off. Dusty and berry-stained, we head for our favorite picnic spot to 
stretch out on the grass. Those berries not already eaten are tucked away in 
the coolers. 
</P>
<P>
 When we arrive home in the evening, everyone disappears while I begin to sort 
and clean the berries. I slice them for freezing, and with the others I make 
jam, alternatively tossing one in the pot, one in my mouth. The doors are open, 
the kitchen is warm and sticky and the baseball game is on. As midnight 
approaches, I promise myself that next year we won't pick so many berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowls of berries, baskets of berries, fields of berries -- the summer brings 
us a bounty of berries and happily we eat them all. We eat them fresh or cook 
them into pies, cobblers and jams. They are intertwined with memories and 
occasions throughout the summer: Fourth of July means strawberry shortcake, 
Labor Day brings blueberry cobbler, and birthdays and gatherings in between 
mean lots of berry pies. 
</P>
<P>
 My best friend's father loved to pick wild blackberries. It was his hobby and 
he took it quite seriously, even though the season lasted only two to three 
weeks. He had a favorite patch, though he never told anyone where it was. He 
would take a clean two-pound shortening can, punch two holes in it and attach a 
wire handle. He'd set out in the morning to patiently gather enough of these 
jewel-like berries to make a pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the house he would oversee the cleaning of the berries, coaching his 
young daughter all the while, "Just a slight drizzle of water when you wash -- 
if you use too much you'll wash away the juice." 
</P>
<P>
 Patiently the stems were removed, each berry picked clean, and then it would 
be time to make a pie. His rules for the pie were few but strict: Never use too 
much flour and never serve it with ice cream. He was a purist. 
</P>
<P>
 There is evidence that berries were eaten and savored as long ago as 5000 B.C. 
By the early 17th Century, berries were cultivated in kitchen gardens in 
England. Strawberries, in particular, were a favorite subject of European 
artists, who painted them bright red, plump and ready to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the New World, the variety of wild berries available delighted the early 
settlers. They found wild strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, gooseberries 
and cranberries, which they ate both fresh and cooked. The Native Americans 
taught them how to preserve them by drying them in the sun. High in vitamins 
and minerals, berries became an important part of their diet. 
</P>
<P>
 The invention of canning early in the 19th Century led to the gradual 
near-elimination of the local growers markets. Farmers could now grow berries 
in larger quantities for people who could preserve (rather than immediately 
have to consume) them. The development of the railroads further aided the 
growth of the commercial berry market. Once limited to selling their goods near 
where they lived, farmers were now able to ship larger quantities across 
greater distances. It was also around this time that plant breeders and 
botanists began hybridizing new varieties of cultivated berries, improving the 
size and quality, making them better suited for growing on a commercial scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gold Rush of 1849 expanded the commercial berry business further. As huge 
numbers of pioneers flooded the West, horticultural centers on the northern and 
central coasts of California were established. Later, when the population 
migrated into the Pacific Northwest, the Willamette Valley in Oregon became a 
central growing region for strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, 
gooseberries and currants. These Western regions -- Hood River, Ore., and 
Watsonville, Calif., in particular -- continue to produce some of the finest 
berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, we enjoy a wide choice of beautiful berries. Although berries grow best 
in certain regions in the United States, thanks to refrigerated shipping they 
can be enjoyed all around the country. In the summer, you can gather berries 
from your own garden, seek out the nearest you-pick farm, visit a nearby 
farmers market or fill your basket at your own secret berry patch.

 Fresh fruit tarts are so beautiful, but many times the crust and filling are 
disappointing. The wonderful crisp texture of this cornmeal crust and creamy 
filling will live up to your expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 BLACK, GOLDEN AND RED RASPBERRY TART 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup fine yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg plus 1 egg yolk 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon dark rum or water 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound cream cheese, softened 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sifted powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound fresh mascarpone cheese 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups assorted raspberries combination of black, golden and red, rinsed and 
well dried 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare crust, combine flour, cornmeal, salt and baking powder in medium 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Place butter and granulated sugar in bowl of food processor and cream until 
light and fluffy. Add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, lemon zest, egg, egg yolk 
and rum. Pulse until well blended. Transfer mixture to bowl containing dry 
ingredients and stir until well mixed. Dough should be sticky and thick. Wrap 
in wax paper and refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide dough in half. Freeze half for another time. Knead remaining half 4 to 
5 times on lightly floured surface. Sprinkle small amount flour on dough and 
rolling pin to prevent sticking and roll dough into 10-inch circle, about 1/4 
inch thick. If dough is sticky, roll out between 2 sheets of wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Ease dough carefully into 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Lightly press 
dough into pan. If it tears, simply press together. Cover dough with sheet of 
foil and fill with 2 cups pie weights or uncooked rice or beans. Bake at 350 
degrees 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove foil and pie weights and bake until crust browns slightly, 12 minutes 
longer. Remove from oven. Let cool 5 minutes. Carefully remove outside ring of 
pan. Gently slip tart shell off metal bottom with long metal spatula and 
carefully transfer to cooling rack. Let cool 30 minutes. Place cooled tart 
shell on serving plate and cover with plastic wrap until ready to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare filling, beat cream cheese, cream, powdered sugar and remaining 1/4 
teaspoon vanilla extract in large bowl until fluffy. Fold in mascarpone, using 
flexible spatula. Spread filling in cooled tart crust with flexible spatula. 
Top with black, golden and red raspberries, arranging berries in concentric 
circles. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

AMERICAN CORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because I love to celebrate the Fourth of July, no matter where in the world 
my feet happen to be planted, this year I'll be fixing an American barbecue in 
Provence -- even if it takes some detective work to find all the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 For the main course, we'll serve quartered chickens marinated in lemon juice, 
garlic and cracked black pepper and cooked over a grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside, we'll have sliced ripe tomatoes sprinkled with chives. A salad of 
green beans and potatoes in a vinaigrette dressing and savory corn pudding will 
recall other Fourth of July holidays spent at home, as will strawberry 
shortcake for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 The corn pudding may be a challenge to prepare in France. For years, corn has 
been used primarily as animal fodder. Only recently have the French discovered 
that the delicious taste of sweet corn is appropriate for their own 
consumption, but it's still hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the corn is located, this dish can be assembled in short order. 
</P>
<P>
 The kernels are sauteed along with sweet onions and garlic and then stirred 
into a quickly made, butterless white sauce. The sauce is enriched with a 
seasoning of thyme and a little shredded white Cheddar. The pudding is baked 
until set and served warm, garnished with sprigs of fresh thyme. CORN AND SWEET 
ONION PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups evaporated skim milk or 1% milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup shredded Vermont sharp white Cheddar cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
 Cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chopped sweet onions, such as Vidalias, or yellow or white mild onions 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 
</P>
<P>
 2 large eggs or equivalent of egg substitute, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 cups scraped fresh corn kernels 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh thyme sprigs 
</P>
<P>
 Place flour in heavy, medium saucepan and whisk in 1/4 cup milk to make paste. 
Pour in remaining 1 1/4 cups milk and stir thoroughly. Place pan over medium 
heat and cook, stirring, until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Add cheese 
handful at time, whisking constantly. Remove sauce from heat. Stir in 1/2 
teaspoon salt, pepper to taste, dried thyme and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne. Set aside 
to cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Spray large, heavy, medium skillet generously with non-stick spray. Place over 
medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add onions and cook, stirring until tender, 
about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook and stir 4 to 5 minutes more. Add 1/4 
teaspoon salt, pepper to taste and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk eggs into cooled sauce. Add corn and onions. Spread mixture evenly in 
shallow, 6-cup, oven-to-table baking dish sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. 
Bake at 375 degrees on center oven rack until pudding is firm and golden on 
top, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool 5 to 10 minutes. Place cluster of thyme sprigs in 
center of cooked dish. Serve hot. Makes 6 servings.

FOURTH OF JULY; THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE BAILEY, Bailey is the author of the newly released Lee Bailey's Long 
Weekend (Clarkson Potter), from which this is excerpted. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every summer I go up to Lenox, in the Berkshire Mountains, for a visit. The 
Berkshires begin to rise in the top corner of Connecticut and continue to roll 
through western Massachusetts. There are places close to Lenox where the 
landscape opens up onto vistas that resemble a more verdant Tuscany, with hills 
crowned by dense stands of pine, ash, spruce, chestnut, hemlock, oak, maple and 
birch.  
</P>
<P>
 Winter locks these hills in a picture-postcard stillness with snow banked high 
against jagged rock outcroppings, brilliant white against the evergreens. As 
compelling as this winter beauty is, it's the summer I love best. 
</P>
<P>
 The same must have been true for a small group of extremely well-off 
Bostonians, New Yorkers and Philadelphians who, in the 1920s and 1930s, built 
summer cottages in and around Lenox. These "cottages" have dozens of bedrooms 
(and probably too few bathrooms), galleries and garages, as well as buildings 
to house gardeners, chauffeurs and other servants. 
</P>
<P>
 My friends and I, of course, do without the servants. In fact, one of our 
favorite vacation activities is cooking elaborate -- and not so elaborate -- 
dinner parties. This casual meal is something we like to prepare around the 
Fourth of July, when it's warm at noon and cool in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 You have the makings of a little outdoor feast here. Take along squares of 
foil and extra paper napkins to wrap around the pita halves to keep them from 
leaking after they're stuffed with pieces of chicken and a little of the 
relish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'll need to make this a couple of days in advance. Be sure it is at room 
temperature when serving. It shouldn't be served directly from the 
refrigerator.  
</P>
<P>
 GRILLED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH DRIED CRANBERRY RELISH 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup dried cranberries or golden raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2 1/4 cups coarsely chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup coarsely chopped shallots 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup pecans or walnuts, toasted and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 6 skinned and boned chicken breast halves 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetable oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Shredded mixed garden greens, optional 
</P>
<P>
 8 pita bread halves 
</P>
<P>
 Cover cranberries with orange juice in small nonreactive saucepan. Warm 
mixture over medium heat. Do not let boil. Set aside 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile combine olive oil, onions and shallots in skillet. Cook very slowly 
until tender, but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add vinegar and 
cranberry-orange juice mixture. Simmer 4 minutes. Stir in pecans. Set aside to 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush chicken breasts lightly with vegetable oil. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Grill over hot coals (or in broiler) until just done. Few minutes 
on either side, depending on size of breasts and how close they are to heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread half of cranberry mixture over bottom of shallow dish. Place grilled 
chicken on top in single layer. Cover with remaining cranberry mixture and 
refrigerate, covered, 2 to 3 days before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, cut each breast half crosswise, then lengthwise. Stuff 
into 8 pita halves with some cranberry relish and shredded mixed garden greens. 
Makes 8 servings.

FOURTH OF JULY; WINGING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buffalo is famous for more than having a team that loses the Super Bowl. In 
the competition for best bar food, it has no challengers: Buffalo chicken 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they aren't just bar food. They're one of America's favorite 
snacks. Hot, spicy and yes, a little greasy, Buffalo wings are a winning dish, 
especially for a Fourth of July party. 
</P>
<P>
 So many contrasts appeal to the senses. First the flavor: spicy chicken. Then 
the temperature: hot chicken. Finally, the texture: chewy chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 And let's not forget another of Buffalo wings' charms -- they use one of the 
cheapest cuts of meat around.  
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the definitive recipe for Buffalo chicken wings. It's bits and 
pieces of several recipes put together to score big on flavor. SPICY FRIED 
CHICKEN WINGS 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 12 chicken wings 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon seasoned salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon paprika 
</P>
<P>
 Oil for deep-fat frying 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Hot red pepper sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse chicken wings and pat dry. Combine flour, garlic salt, seasoned salt, 
cayenne, black pepper and paprika in plastic food bag. Add chicken, half at 
time, and shake to coat with flour mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 inches oil for deep-fat frying to 375 degrees in deep skillet. Shake 
off excess flour and add half chicken wings at time, frying on both sides until 
golden, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Remove to paper towel-lined plate and fry 
remaining wings. Season to taste with salt. Serve hot red pepper sauce on side. 
Serve hot. Makes 2 servings.

WINE: SUMMER WINES: THINK PINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rose has always been thought of as an inexpensive wine. But these days the few 
good, dry rose wines that remain on the market -- even those pushing $10 a 
bottle -- may be considered bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a good dry rose, winemakers must use very good red grapes, since these 
wines don't rely on sugar to cover up flaws, such as bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 But red wine grapes are more expensive now than they've been in a long time. 
In the last two years, news reports that moderate consumption of red wine may 
reduce the risk of heart disease have increased demand for red wine. This has 
driven up prices for red grapes, creating a shortage in California that has 
made it hard on those committed to rose. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that not much great rose is made, but the few good ones offer 
consumers a wonderful wine with great flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 When I suggest to people that they try a rose, most wince and think I'm crazy. 
To avoid being called names, I have recently taken to adding, "But it's really 
nice at picnics and on patios, with barbecued burgers and salads and grilled 
sausages and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The most versatile rose is dry, or off-dry. Sweeter versions don't work well 
with food. They are closer to soda than to wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who make sweet rose suggest you serve it very cold (which masks the 
awful smell and taste); the sugar covers up what little flavor there is. 
</P>
<P>
 With the red grape shortage, it's hard to find a good dry rose for less than 
about $7, which is more than most people feel rose ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if you're not upset paying $12 for a bottle of Chardonnay, the $8 to 
$10 you'd pay for a bottle of good rose seems like a bargain, especially in 
view of the refreshment and taste you get and how it matches certain foods and 
certain moments better than any Chardonnay could. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the best rose wines for a Fourth of July party may not be easy. Many 
grocery store wine buyers think all rose is sweet, so they feel any old rose is 
OK. Fine wine shops offer a better chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best every year is the Grenache Rose designated Vin de Mistral from 
Joseph Phelps Vineyards ($10). 
</P>
<P>
 The wine has loads of spicy, cranberry-like fruit and is full-bodied, so it 
doesn't seem totally dry. This is serious rose that gains weight with time in 
the bottle, but is best drunk young. The 1993 version has just been released; 
the '92 is still marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago I found a bottle of 1989 Phelps Grenache Rose in my cellar and 
opened it for some knowledgeable wine folks. Some remarked that it had lost a 
bit of fruit, but the wine was still eminently drinkable. And the 1991, tasted 
three weeks ago, was still excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best new rose wines I have tried in the last few years is a 1993 
Cinsault ($6) from Mel Master's Les Jamelles brand. 
</P>
<P>
 This must-taste wine is made from grapes grown in France's Corbieres region, 
best known for its rich red wines. It is a gem, with a carload of raspberry and 
strawberry aromas, a soft entry and crisp, dry finish. The color is an almost 
iridescent pink and the balance is perfect for either cooling off or pairing 
with food. 
</P>
<P>
 Another wine superb with appetizers like cheeses and dips is 1992 Heitz Wine 
Cellars Grignolino Rose ($6). There is a delightful orange peel and strawberry 
aroma, and the wine is lighter in weight than some. It's a bargain at the 
price. There will be no 1993 version -- the fruit never ripened properly. 
</P>
<P>
 I also like McDowell Valley Grenache Rose ($7.50), which tends to be a tad 
soft, but appealingly fruity. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of wineries make near-rose from Pinot Noir grapes. These are slightly 
pink (or salmon-colored) wines that are made essentially dry; a few are aged in 
oak. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of these is the exceptional new 1993 Etude Rose of Pinot Noir 
($10.50), which is an incredible experience. The wine has the purest form of 
Pinot Noir fruit without oak or sugar. Made by Tony Soter, one of the Napa 
Valley's top winemakers, it reminds me of a sparkling blanc de noirs without 
bubbles. Not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Others made this way are Bonny Doon Winery "Vin Gris de Cigare"; "Vincent Vin 
Gris" of Saintsbury; Au Bon Climat Vin Gris ($9), and Sanford Winery Vin Gris 
($8).

HOT PROPERTY: GUESS WHO'S GOING TO N.Y.?

<P>
 Academy Award-winning actor SIDNEY POITIER and his wife, Joanna, have sold 
their Beverly Hills home of 19 years and have purchased a co-op in a pre-World 
War II building in New York City, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Poitier, 70, was the first African American to win a best actor Oscar ("Lilies 
of the Field" in 1963), and he was the first man of color to win the American 
Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, he and singer Harry Belafonte were winners of the first Thurgood 
Marshall Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Education Fund. Poitier played the late Supreme Court justice in the 1991 
miniseries "Separate But Equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Poitier, also a director ("Fast Forward," "Ghost Dad"), has starred in dozens 
of films, including "Sneakers" (1992), "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" (1967) 
and "A Raisin in the Sun" (1961), in which he also starred on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Poitier, an actress in France before she married Poitier more than 22 
years ago, is an interior designer who has decorated a number of celebrities' 
homes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Poitiers aren't deserting Southern California but are said to be planning 
on keeping a smaller place in the Los Angeles area while becoming more 
bicoastal and possibly maintaining a residence in London as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple sold their Beverly Hills home for about $4.5 million to Al Checchi, 
co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, sources say. The house was listed in 1992 at 
just under $7 million. It was most recently listed with Barbara Duskin of 
Douglas Properties, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1927, the Italian Mediterranean-style home has four bedrooms and a 
maid's apartment in nearly 8,500 square feet. The home is on 1.1 acres, with 
flower gardens, a pool, courtyard and fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Poitiers bought a $2.5-million co-op in Manhattan. The two-story, 
5,500-square-foot unit is in a high rise on Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey home of late PRESIDENT RICHARD M. NIXON has been put on the 
market at $1.2 million.

 The nation's 37th President succumbed to a stroke at a New York hospital April 
22, four days after he was taken there by ambulance from his townhouse in Park 
Ridge, N.J., about 15 miles from Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 The townhouse had been Nixon's residence since the spring of 1990, when he and 
former First Lady Pat moved there from a 15-room house nearby that they sold 
for $2.4 million, sources say. Pat Nixon died a year ago June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's four-story, 3,500-square-foot townhouse has an elevator and nine 
rooms, including three bedrooms, a solarium opening onto a terrace; a breakfast 
room; sitting room with a cathedral ceiling, and library with three dormers and 
handcrafted bookshelves. The library may be re-created as a room at the Richard 
Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lenk of Lenk Friedberg Properties in Cresskill, N.J., has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors LIAM NEESON ("Schindler's List") and NATASHA RICHARDSON (TNT's "Zelda," 
about F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife) have purchased what has been described as "a 
charming, Colonial-style country house" in Millbrook, Upstate New York, for 
close to its asking price of $1.25 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot home also has been called "a gracious 
farmhouse," built in 1810. 
</P>
<P>
 Neeson, who also has a loft in Manhattan, sold his Los Angeles home in January 
for close to its asking price of $439,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, daughter of director Tony Richardson and actress Vanessa Redgrave, 
and Neeson, who was nominated for the best-actor Oscar this year, became 
interested in each other while co-starring in "Anna Christie" on Broadway in 
early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sotheby's International Realty handled the Millbrook transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 PRETTY PENNY, home of the late actress HELEN HAYES, is on the market at $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, the diminutive grande dame of American theater who had won two Oscars 
(most recently for "Airport" in 1970), lived at the residence in Nyack, N.Y., a 
suburb of New York City, for nearly 60 years. She was 92 when she died at a 
local hospital in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, actor James MacArthur, and his wife, H.B., live in Palm Desert, 
Calif., but they are spending a lot of time at Pretty Penny until it is sold, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 MacArthur grew up at Pretty Penny, where his mother and father, late 
journalist-playwright Charles MacArthur, entertained such theater legends as 
Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and Noel Coward. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty Penny is an 18-room, 5,000-square-foot Victorian, built about 1880 on 
the west bank of the Hudson River. It has terraced grounds and brick paths that 
wind through a formal rose garden past a fountain with a lily pond to a 
60-foot-long pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Anderson of Sotheby's in New York City has the listing.

POP MUSIC; A ROUGH COUNTRY ROAD; IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT JOHN MICHAEL MONTGOMERY 
GREW UP TO BE A HONKY-TONK HERO. BUT THE TRANSFORMATION FROM SMALL-TOWN SINGER 
TO BIG-TIME COUNTRY HEARTTHROB HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR A 'NICE GUY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, Richard Cromelin writes about pop music for Calendar. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Michael Montgomery was in the center of country's spotlight just 24 hours 
ago, a swaggering Kentuckian in a black-and-red leather jacket on national 
television from the Universal Amphitheatre. He was named the Academy of Country 
Music's best new male artist and singer of the song of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's sitting cross-legged in a small, austere trailer dressing room behind 
the stage at the county fairgrounds in Pomona -- waiting it out in the echoing 
sonic backwash as Marty Stuart, Doug Supernaw and other country colleagues 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a few more hours before Montgomery finally plays for a chilled 
crowd at the end of a long day at "Fanfest '94," a country-music expo that's 
running a little behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The down time in this business is tremendous, and I don't like a lot of down 
time," says country music's top rookie of 1993. "It's like I'm caught in this 
little trap." 
</P>
<P>
 Another day of down time has Montgomery in mind of some of the less pleasant 
surprises he's encountered in his rapid transformation from four sets a night 
at a Kentucky nightclub to big-time heartthrob balladeer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad taught me (to) always respect the people out there that put you where 
you're at, and I always try to do that," he says earnestly. "But I guess maybe 
I hope that they understand when I say 'no' to them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time that taught me a lesson. I was signing autographs . . . and 
my head was actually bobbin', I was so tired. I got up and waved to the crowd 
and said, 'Sorry, I got to go,' and I got booed by the rest of them. I mean 
they booed me, and I was like gosh . That makes you feel like (expletive). 
That's the side that people don't understand. These people put you where you're 
at, but you just have so many things expected of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery appears genuinely hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bears on my mind quite a bit," he confides. "It's part of it that I just 
didn't realize." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is much on Montgomery's mind as he prepares to open for Reba McEntire on 
Friday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and Saturday and next Sunday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. In fact, he won't stop talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say he's shy, but that doesn't mean he's a laconic country boy. 
There's nothing slick about him; he takes questions seriously and handles them 
the way he might track a deer in the hills back home. He takes his time, 
circles repeatedly, retraces his steps, and finally brings it down from sheer 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a guy that (if) somebody wants my attention, I give it to 'em," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts he's as genuine as he appears. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very sensitive man," says singer-songwriter Victoria Shaw, the 
co-writer of his first big ballad hit, "I Love the Way You Love Me." Shaw 
recalls a recent Montgomery show in Arizona in which she was watching from the 
wings when he started her song. Suddenly he came over and brought her onto the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sang the rest of the song to me just face to face, with his arm around 
me," she says. "In the middle of the song, I thought, 'God, his eyes are very 
watery,' and at the end of the song, tears were running down his face. He said 
to the audience, 'That song touches me every time I sing it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't like all the hoopla," says Rick Blackburn, president of Atlantic 
Nashville, the label that signed him in 1990 and has released his two albums. 
"I had to talk him into doin' the Letterman show. He's real timid when it comes 
to that. He likes to perform, and be able to go to the Burger King and 
Wal-Mart, and it irritates him some that he can't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 You can see why Montgomery, 29 and single, would raise a fuss at the shopping 
center. Even in his casual clothes -- leather baseball cap, black T-shirt, 
jeans and fringed jacket -- he cuts a striking figure. He is tall and athletic 
looking, with wide-set eyes and dimpled cheeks. Top it with a cowboy hat, and 
you've got a '30s-vintage Western matinee idol. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his look, not his musical instincts, that set the tone of Montgomery's 
recording career. 
</P>
<P>
 When Blackburn visited the Austin City Saloon in Lexington to check out 
Montgomery, he found a rocking performer singing material by Lynyrd Skynyrd, 
Charlie Daniels and Bob Seger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't doin' any kind of power ballads at all," Blackburn says from his 
Nashville, Tenn., office. "I thought, 'As good lookin' as he is, if he can sing 
some power ballads, that's sure gonna make it interesting, because that market 
is open. If we can take him one on one with the female audience out there, 
maybe it can work.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So we found that song 'I Love the Way You Love Me,' and 'I Swear,' 'Rope the 
Moon' -- stuff like that. He was open to it. Now he's got a niche. In a way 
he's sort of like a Michael Bolton of country, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably the last niche Montgomery expected to occupy when he was 
literally growing up with country music. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Harold Montgomery, was an aspiring country singer, and with his 
wife, Carol, on drums he played wherever he could in the area around 
Nicholasville, Ky. Eventually the kids -- John Michael, younger sister Becky 
and older brother Eddie -- joined the act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our family, it was a totally different lifestyle," Montgomery says. "We all 
lived around this big cravin', and that was music. We had musicians come over 
to our living room every night to play and practice. As a kid, at 2 and 3 
o'clock in the mornin', I was allowed to sit there and watch 'em play, and get 
up the next mornin' and go to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they lived for, to be able to go out and play on the weekends. 
They would not work a job if it meant that they had to give up their music. If 
it meant takin' a cut in pay and goin' somewhere else and us livin' somewhere 
that wasn't too nice, then that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough going financially -- that was the main factor in his parents' 
divorce, Montgomery says. But the music took, and Montgomery went out and 
became a fixture in local honky-tonks. He wasn't exactly an overnight success, 
working the clubs for several years before Atlantic Nashville signed him. 
</P>
<P>
 His debut album, "Life's a Dance," came out in late '92 and went to No. 1 on 
both the country and pop charts. "Kickin' It Up" came out last January and 
duplicated that feat. The two albums have yielded a string of hit country 
singles, including "Life's a Dance," "I Love the Way You Love Me," "I Swear" 
and the current "Rope the Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewers, though, have suggested that his significance is commercial rather 
than creative, citing formulaic material and a limited vision as a vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critics -- a lot of 'em say I played it safe or whatever. Well, I grew up 
singin' hits off the radio, and that's the kind of songs I want to sing -- hits 
that other people are gonna play in bars that might influence another guy out 
there one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gonna make me feel proud one day for them to say the same thing about me 
like I say about Merle Haggard or I say about George Strait or I say about Bob 
Seger or I say about the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of critics like it out in left field, something different from 
the mainstream, but where I come from we never played music that was way out in 
left field in the clubs, and I'm just gonna put out music that I know is gonna 
reach out to the public, get on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery's road manager knocks on the door and tells him that it's time at 
last for him to get ready for his show, a good five hours after he'd inched 
through the rush-hour traffic from Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I was a genie or somethin'," the singer says. "I could snap my fingers 
and I'm at the show and ready to go. 'Cause that's the only thing I really look 
forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with it all my life. When I don't get any more awards anymore and I 
don't do any more concerts, I know that back home somewhere or another I'll be 
goin' somewhere, and I'll probably pick and sing, playin' my old hits from 
yesterday. It's just somethin' that you never give up doin.' "

CLINIC GIVES YOUTHS LESSONS IN SELF-ESTEEM; CENTER HAS BEEN HELPING TROUBLED 
SOUTH-CENTRAL CHILDREN FOR 70 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some students liken it to day camp, an easy getaway from the hassles of school 
with a few fun day trips. A few others say it's like a prison, with too many 
restrictions and not enough freedom to do what they want. 
</P>
<P>
 But few of these young people deny that they learn something at the Los 
Angeles Child Guidance Clinic -- either academic or about themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 For 70 years, the clinic has used a mixture of group and individual counseling 
and small classrooms to work with youths who are emotionally disturbed, are 
abused or have behavioral problems. The goal is to help them work through their 
problems by raising their self-esteem and getting them back into the mainstream 
either in school or a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely doing things different since I've been here, like I used to 
use profanity a lot and I still cuss a bit, but not like I did before," said 
17-year-old Derek, who had been in and out of detention centers since he was 
13. "And math used to be my worst subject, but now I'm getting A's." 
</P>
<P>
 Derek's calm voice and his respect for his teacher, Audrey Coleman -- whom he 
calls Granny -- belie the violent temper for which he is known. In the month 
that he has been at the clinic, he has been working one-on-one with a counselor 
and has made it a goal to keep his cool and direct himself in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "People try and push my buttons and test me, but I'm learning now to pull back 
and not be so quick to hit someone first," Derek said. "And I'm also learning 
that I'm a leader, not a follower. Like Granny, she's always encouraging me to 
talk to other kids because sometimes they listen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit clinic, which started in 1924 as the first operation of its kind 
west of the Mississippi River, is the only agency in South-Central that 
provides comprehensive mental health services for emotionally disturbed or 
abused young people. Its 100 clients, the majority of whom are Latino and 
African American, range in age from 18 months to 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the clients we serve, you have a series of behaviors and symptoms -- 
like schizophrenia, depression and paranoia -- from incidents or organic 
situations (such as babies born addicted to crack cocaine) that impair them in 
different parts of their lives," said Cecilia Johnson, director of clinical 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the youths who attend classes and counseling sessions at the clinic 
are referred by the Los Angeles Unified School District. An additional 40% are 
referred by the county Department of Children's Services and the remainder by 
the county Department of Mental Health and the state Department of 
Rehabilitation, Johnson said. These agencies also fund some of the clinic's 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the circumstances that bring some youths to the clinic, 
confidentiality is vital, Johnson said. Students are referred to only by their 
first names for many visitors. Those names have been changed in this story. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic had been based for 30 years in a small West Adams facility, 
offering individual, group and family therapy; parent and guardian counseling; 
child abuse and neglect prevention; a preschool for 2- to 5-year-olds with 
behavioral and emotional problems; after-school treatment for elementary school 
children, and adolescent day treatment with an on-site junior and senior high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing rise in the number of young people and children being referred 
to the clinic created a need for more services and more space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a tenfold increase in services between 1975 and 1985, but there was no 
way to physically accommodate these needs," said executive director Elizabeth 
Fromm. "We were holding classes in rooms not constructed as classrooms and had 
no rooms to devote to our adolescents." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the clinic moved to a new building on Vermont Avenue near Exposition 
Boulevard, a peach-colored three-story facility of administrative and therapy 
offices, classrooms, a multipurpose room and a small playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by $9.4 million in private contributions, the new 40,000-square-foot 
facility has allowed the clinic to expand its outpatient mental health services 
by 50%, add classes for junior high school children and decrease the number of 
students in each class to allow for more personalized attention, Fromm said. 
</P>
<P>
 What many of the students need is a sympathetic ear and, most important, 
someone to believe in them so they can believe in themselves, said Coleman, a 
42-year teaching veteran who joined the clinic's staff last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is someplace they need to be, because we do a lot of one-on-one to build 
self-esteem. And self-esteem is so important to these students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his month at the clinic, Derek has decided that he wants to be a 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this place has been good," he said. "It's helped me see that once I 
get on my feet that I can really do things to help people."

COUNCIL OKS 'EMPOWERMENT ZONE' APPLICATION; RENEWAL: EASTSIDE AND SOUTH-CENTRAL 
WOULD RECEIVE THE LION'S SHARE OF $100 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved an application for one of six 
nationwide federal "empowerment zones" that will be designated later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 With its combination of $100 million for social programs and tax incentives 
for businesses in poor areas, the zone, if approved by the federal government, 
will be the most significant economic development program in Los Angeles in 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will designate the zones 
in September. Competition for the program is fierce, with more than 400 cities 
expected to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 City bureaucrats have been scrambling to meet a Thursday deadline after being 
informed by HUD officials earlier this month that Los Angeles' application was 
lacking in detail and not competitive. City officials said they were told they 
had to outline specific programs that would be funded with the $100-million 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a lot of work, but it will get done on time," said Marilyn 
Lurie, director of industrial and commercial development for the city's 
Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the city's application Wednesday. The empowerment zones 
are the showpiece of the Clinton Administration's urban agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Los Angeles' application, the Eastside and South-Central would receive 
the lion's share of the federal funds. The application calls for dividing the 
20-square-mile zone into three pieces, each of which meets federal guidelines 
requiring that at least half of the census tracts have poverty rates of 35% or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 One empowerment zone would start in the industrial area of Boyle Heights, 
cross the Los Angeles River and encompass a section of South-Central along the 
Central Avenue corridor. The second area would take in the Broadway-Manchester 
corridor in South-Central, stretch south and include Watts and unincorporated 
county areas in Willowbrook. The third portion would include about two square 
miles in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles also is applying for four of the 65 HUD-designated "empowerment 
communities" that will receive $3 million each in federal funds. Those areas 
would include portions of Pico-Union, Westlake, Koreatown, South-Central and 
the Eastside. The Southeast cities of Cudahy, Vernon, Huntington Park, Maywood, 
Bell and Bell Gardens also applied for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 During Los Angeles City Council hearings, community leaders had expressed 
concern that they would not be allowed sufficient decision-making input on how 
the money will be spent if Los Angeles' application is approved, as expected. 
Last week, however, they were generally optimistic that their concerns would be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we ensure that community residents are actively involved and push 
to make sure (officials) are held accountable, we should be fine," said 
Jonathon Newsom, president of Drew Economic Development Corp. in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal guidelines, the city would be allowed to spend the $100 million 
for programs ranging from child care to job training. Also, businesses in the 
zone would be eligible to receive various tax incentives. They would include 
payroll tax breaks of as much as 20% on the wages of workers who live in the 
zone and accelerated depreciation of equipment, enabling owners to write off 
machinery as a loss as soon as it is purchased instead of the normal five- to 
seven-year period.

MOVIES / COMMENTARY; THOU SHALT NOT MISS 'DECALOGUE'; IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY 
KRZYSZTOF KIESLOWSKI'S RARELY SEEN RIFF ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS HAS BEEN 
LIKENED TO 'CITIZEN KANE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, Kenneth Turan is The Times' film critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some films are a pleasure to watch, some a duty, some (yes, it happens) an 
awful chore. But rarest of all are those films that are so accomplished, so 
overwhelming, so profound that seeing them on screen is nothing less than a 
privilege. Krzysztof Kieslowski's "The Decalogue" is such an event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Decalogue" -- 10 films based loosely on the Ten Commandments and 
originally made for Polish television -- has been the talk of the film world 
since it premiered in full at the Venice Film Festival in 1989, winning acclaim 
as one of the indisputably great accomplishments of modern filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the North American rights to the series are owned by a Canadian 
group whose terms for distribution domestic companies consider too stiff, "The 
Decalogue" is close to unknown in this country. It has never played 
commercially, it is unavailable on video, and even the times it has been shown 
at film festivals can be counted on one hand. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those was at 1990's AFI Film Festival, and now Ken Wlaschin, the 
festival director, who is not alone in considering the series "the 'Citizen 
Kane' of our time," has brought it back for this year's event. No one who takes 
film at all seriously can have any excuse for missing it this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the cumulative effect of all 10 films, which run about an hour each, is 
overpowering, each segment is completely self-contained and can easily be seen 
independently of the others. The AFI Festival has scheduled both afternoon and 
evening screenings for the series, with the first two films set for Tuesday and 
two each on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the post-Andrzej Wajda generation of Polish directors that 
includes Krzysztof Zanussi and Jerzy Skolimowski, Kieslowski is best known in 
this country for his current "Three Colors" trilogy, with "Blue" premiering 
last year, "White" ( see accompanying story on actor Zbigniew Zamachowski) 
currently playing and "Red," woefully overlooked by the Cannes Film Festival 
jury, scheduled to open in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The director first came to international notice when his darkly satirical 1979 
"Camera Buff" won several international awards. He co-wrote "The Decalogue" 
with Krzysztof Piesiewicz and originally intended, he says, to have 10 
different directors involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I liked doing the first film so much," he told interviewer Annette 
Insdorf in 1990, "that I didn't want to give the others away." Using nine 
different cinematographers, he shot and edited the entire series in a 
remarkable 21 months: "Sometimes I'd shoot part of one film in the morning, 
part of a second in another location in the afternoon and a different one in 
the evening. That kept me from getting bored."

 Though these films are based on the Ten Commandments, Kieslowski has delighted 
in making the connection oblique and difficult. The commandments are dealt with 
in order, but each film is identified only by its number, and nowhere in any of 
the films is the commandment in question explicitly referred to. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, paradoxically, if there is one thing that sets "The Decalogue" apart, it 
is the ease with which it confronts the most serious questions of life, death, 
morality and belief. As much a rigorous scientist determined to explore human 
behavior in extremis as a creator of moral parables, Kieslowski places his 
characters in agonizing dilemmas, confronting them with problems that defy 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 As compassionate as he is pessimistic, Kieslowski understands that when human 
needs are in conflict, life is devoid of easy choices. "Man doesn't choose 
between good and evil" is how he's put it in interviews. "He chooses between 
greater and lesser evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Resolving problems, then, either tidily or otherwise, is far from the 
director's concern. The exploration itself, the deep probing of psychological 
states in the hope of uncovering a sliver of illumination, "the contradiction," 
in Kieslowski's own words, "between complicated characters and simple stories," 
is why "The Decalogue" was made and why it is so compelling and so powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 As emotionally lacerating as these despairing, ambiguous pieces can be, they 
never so much as flirt with pretension, and that is partially a result of 
Kieslowski's absolute assurance as a director, his command of all the resources 
cinema has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kieslowski used nine cinematographers, the director's spare, minimal 
visual style dominates each episode. The camera work is at once so fluid and so 
precise that you fear to take your eyes from the screen, and the films are so 
packed with nuance and gesture that they seem to be feature length though they 
are not even close. 
</P>
<P>
 Kieslowski is helped greatly in his endeavor by the superb actors he has 
chosen for his cast, the best Polish cinema has to offer. All perform with 
exceptional restraint, and all, including the children who appear in some 
episodes, have faces that speak movingly even when words are absent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stories, briefly encapsulated with the commandments they refer to, are as 
follows: 
</P>
<P>
 One -- " I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. " A 
rationalist father (Henryk Baranowski) and his devoted son (Wojciech Klata) 
share a passion for the father's computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two -- " Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. " A married 
woman (Krystyna Janda) pregnant by another man asks a doctor (Aleksander 
Bardini) whether her dying husband will live so she can decide if she needs to 
have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Three -- " Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. " A married man (Daniel 
Olbrychski) has his Christmas Eve interrupted by his desperate former lover 
(Maria Pakulnis). 
</P>
<P>
 Four -- " Honor thy father and thy mother. " The relationship between a 
20-year-old daughter (Adrianna Biedrzynska) and her father (Janus Gajos) 
powerfully changes when she reads a letter that was to have been opened only at 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Five -- " Thou shalt not kill. " The most celebrated film in the series was 
later expanded by the director to a feature known as "A Short Film About 
Killing," which won several major European awards. A gloss on the nature of 
murder, both by the individual and by the state, it features one of the 
screen's most graphic killings, spread out over more than seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Six -- " Thou shalt not commit adultery. " Also was later expanded to a 
feature, called "A Short Film About Love." The most overtly erotic of the 
group, it deals with a young peeping Tom (Olaf Lubaszenko) who falls 
desperately in love with the woman he spies on (Grazyna Szapolowska). 
</P>
<P>
 Seven -- " Thou shalt not steal. " A wrenching story of Majka, a young woman 
(Maja Barelkowska) who has allowed her mother (Ana Polony) to pretend that 
Majka's daughter is her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight -- " Thou shalt not bear false witness. " A professor of ethics who 
survived the Nazi occupation (Maria Koscialkowska) is confronted about her past 
by a young American student (Teresa Marczewska). 
</P>
<P>
 Nine -- " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife. " An impotent husband 
(Piotr Machalica) fears that his wife (Ewa Blaszczyk) is having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten -- " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods. " The only even remotely 
comic episode, though a very dark comedy it is, details what happens when two 
brothers (Zbigniew Zamachowski and Jerzy Stuhr) discover that their dead father 
had the most valuable stamp collection in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Kieslowski's themes and his skill, a key factor unifying these 
stories is the somber score by veteran collaborator Zbigniew Preisner. Best 
known for his work on both "Blue" and "The Double Life of Veronique," Preisner 
here has come in almost on tiptoe, choosing a minimal musical mode that haunts 
each part of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More prosaically, "The Decalogue" is also united by its site, an anonymous 
Warsaw apartment complex where all its protagonists live. Similarly, though he 
doesn't like to explain why, Kieslowski places the same watchful character in 
almost every episode, someone whose silent presence seems to be saying 
something just beyond our understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before "Red," Kieslowski's most recent film, was released, the 
53-year-old director announced that it would be his last, a decision he 
reiterated at Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a country house, he told the French daily Le Figaro, where "there is a 
veranda and a chair. I'll have lots of books, lots of cigarettes, lots of 
coffee. Don't you sometimes dream of the same thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those who see even a part of "The Decalogue," however, will have another 
dream, that this supremely gifted director returns to film as soon as possible.

HOLLYWOOD TRAINS AN EYE ON ZBIGNIEW ZAMACHOWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, James Grant is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He may be one of Poland's most famous faces, but so far, most of America 
hasn't had the pleasure. In the next couple of weeks, though, 33-year-old actor 
Zbigniew Zamachowski will have two opportunities to catch Hollywood's eye. 
Zamachowski stars in both Krzysztof Kieslowski's "The Decalogue, Part 10," 
showing with Part Nine next Sunday at the AFI Festival, and Kieslowski's 
"White," which opened this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent visit to Hollywood, the actor, who boasts immense soulful green 
eyes, sat next to his female interpreter in his hotel suite displaying 
supremely perfect posture and a bemused perspective on his new foreign 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The room is extremely sophisticated in its technology," he says, pushing the 
computerized buttons on the clock that offer him a decadent array of options. 
"Perhaps too sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although both "The Decalogue" and "White" are visions of the same director, 
Zamachowski was given the challenge of playing two diverse roles. In "The 
Decalogue," he portrays a young rock star who, along with his older brother, 
becomes obsessed with a valuable stamp collection. In "White" -- the second of 
Kieslowski's trilogy "Three Colors," based on the French motto "Liberty, 
Equality and Fraternity" and the colors of the French flag -- he faces the 
Angst and vicissitudes of love as the husband of a wayward wife, portrayed by 
French actress Julie Delpy. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Decalogue," the actor sings and plays guitar, two talents that helped 
him originally get discovered in 1980. After seeing Zamachowski perform at a 
national music festival, Polish director Krzysztof Rogulski cast him as the 
lead in the film "The Great Picnic Party." Presumably, the title loses 
something in translation, because it was a huge hit in Poland (it was never 
released in the United States). "It was horrendously popular," Zamachowski says 
with a deep chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 That success prompted him to abandon his studies in economics and music and 
enroll in the famous Lodz Film School, from which he graduated in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, the actor has worked in more than 30 films. His latest 
performance, in "White," is perhaps his best, partly because, he says, the 
character is so meaty. "Karol is more multidimensional, fuller, more human than 
Arthur (his character in "The Decalogue")." 
</P>
<P>
 On working with the notoriously taciturn Kieslowski, Zamachowski says: "The 
work with Krzysztof was very specific. He was very cautious in his remarks. He 
leaves the acting not just to the actor but also to the camera operator. He 
allowed me a certain space of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allow me to tell you what it is like working with Krzysztof. A year before 
starting the filming (of "White"), he told me that he was going to make this 
movie with me and that he wrote the scenario with me in mind. I subsequently 
read with him one day before shooting was to start in Paris.  
</P>
<P>
 "We spoke for about half an hour. He told me that I should keep in mind the 
films of Charlie Chaplin. That doesn't mean that I should imitate him, which 
clearly would have been impossible. But I kept in mind the aura that surrounds 
his films. He told me to keep in mind a certain state of balance between what 
is tragic in this movie and what is comical. I didn't need any more words than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zamachowski was raised in a small town in central Poland by a truck driver 
father and clerk mother. "My family on both sides is quite numerous so we had 
lots of children," he says. "Lots of gardens and trees. The further I advance 
in my life, the more I feel like this was a period of paradise."  
</P>
<P>
 For the past nine years, Zamachowski has resided in Warsaw, where he is 
currently starting his own nuclear family, with his second wife, actress 
Aleksandra Justa, who is four months pregnant with their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 Next fall, the actor begins shooting "Torsje," with director Juliusz 
Machulski. But for now, Zamachowski's thoughts are on Hollywood; this is, in 
fact, his second visit here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first one was a year ago -- I was just a tourist," he says. "The first 
thing I did was to tour Universal Studios. I think this was an incredible 
adventure," he says, his eyes aglow. "When I went on the Earthquake ride, for 
those few minutes, I was a child again."

BOYLE HEIGHTS YOUTH CLUB EARNS UNITED WAY HONORS; AWARD: THE VARIETY BOYS AND 
GIRLS CLUB IS RECOGNIZED FOR ITS PROGRAMS IN EDUCATION, RECREATION AND SPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The United Way of Greater Los Angeles named Variety Boys and Girls Club in 
Boyle Heights as this year's outstanding youth agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The award recognizes the club's programs in education, recreation and sports 
and is given annually to a United Way agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw that this is not the regular Boys and Girls Club but really a club 
where we focus on education and the importance of it," said Baltazar Perez, who 
serves as the club's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, at 2530 Cincinnati St., serves 3,500 to 4,000 7- to 17-year-olds 
with its computer learning center, an after-school study hall with one-on-one 
tutoring, annual scholarships of $2,000 to $10,000, arts and crafts and gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "Variety has been in the Boyle Heights community for years and we wanted to 
recognize that history in serving the community," said Charlotte Torres, 
director of planning and agency relations of the metropolitan region of the 
local United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff of five full- and 10 part-time people also instituted a "Pride in 
Our Community" trash and graffiti removal program last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day, 25 parents showed up with hoes and rakes and 60 kids showed 
up," Perez said of the monthly neighborhood cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this point, we haven't had any major graffiti and nobody has broken the 
fences like they did before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let the gangs know this is a neutral place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ultimate goal is to erase the boundaries here."

TELEVISION; WHO'S MINDING THE MIND?; WITH 'THE HUMAN QUEST: SCIENCE AND THE NEW 
ENLIGHTENMENT,' KCET'S ROGER BINGHAM IS GOING AFTER THE BEST ANSWERS WE HAVE SO 
FAR ABOUT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, Robert Koehler is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The white Buddha figure sits atop the black television set, and, for a moment, 
the Buddha and TV appear to be silly living room partners. In most households, 
that is what they would always be -- a little domestic joke. But in Roger 
Bingham's household, they take on a new meaning. Under this roof, the pair look 
like a union of old and new ways of enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham's house, nestled in the hills here south of downtown, has a habit of 
making the mind work overtime. That's appropriate, considering that the subject 
now occupying Bingham -- one of television's most successful science 
journalists -- is the mind itself. And if "The Human Quest: Science and the New 
Enlightenment," his four-part series now in post-production at public station 
KCET in Los Angeles, comes close to its ambitions, it might set off ideas that 
make Buddha and the TV set look puny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that this series moves in such a way that it mimics the 
way the brain works," Bingham says. "I want the viewer to have a bubbling, 
bouncing brain while watching this." 
</P>
<P>
 The series, to air on PBS nationally sometime between this fall and the 
following spring, has endured the inevitable gantlet of revisions, rewrites and 
reconsiderations. Bingham, though, proudly displays his original proposal, 
written in 1988, its core themes remaining basically intact. One of its key 
statements is a clue to Bingham's twin passions, and why he rejects the 
characterization of television as a vast wasteland: "TV can be a user-friendly 
electronic interface between the lab and the living room." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is something else driving Bingham, a clear mission he speaks of in 
terms that television doesn't usually accommodate: "It seems to me that if 
we're going to have any hope of transcending the position where our species 
finds itself now, and to move in a way where our civic evolution catches up 
with our technological evolution, we must follow the old Delphic oracle 
imperative: 'Know thyself.' And now we're beginning to have the technology for 
doing that. If we have any chance of having some control over our destiny, it's 
essential to find out why we act the way we do, and what the balance is between 
our evolutionary heritage and the cultural overlay we deal with every day." 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone knows who has watched his many science programs, all produced by 
KCET, Science the Bingham Way has its own overlay -- and it's often very funny. 
</P>
<P>
 From his brief early '80s science pieces for KCET's "California Journal" to 
his half-hour and hourlong specials, including "The Time of Our Lives" and 
"Inside Information," Bingham has stirred punning and visual frolics into hard 
science to yield a heady television mixture. "Fat City," his show on food and 
the environment, featured the indelible image of Bingham communing with a dairy 
cow in a way Woody Allen would have admired. In another program, he sat at a 
table at Le Dome restaurant and considered ordering "a double serotonin on the 
rocks" -- the substance in the brain that inhibits neurons that stimulate the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Kulczycki, KCET's senior vice president and station manager, likes to 
sum up Bingham's amusing approach as "a blending of Jonathan Miller, James 
Burke and George Carlin. He's definitely playful, and he's going to mess around 
with your head." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of Bingham's early proposals to KCET was for a show that would be 
titled "A Fun Guide to the Brain." The very first TV program Bingham worked on 
-- "Why in the World?," with host Joseph Benti -- had the subtitle "Why in the 
World Is Science Like a Soap Opera?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham knows he has a way with wit, but at the same time, he cringes at the 
praise he is given for it: "I wish people didn't have to think that you have to 
make science fun, because science is enormous fun in itself. I wish everyone 
would buy and read all of the books on science I read and thus learn about it 
themselves. But that's not going to happen, so maybe one way of hooking people 
is if I can show them on TV that there's this extraordinary intellectual 
adventure going on, and that you don't have to be worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
 With "The Human Quest," Bingham is on to what he likes to call the Big 
Questions, and they have little to do with the soaps. If there's a guiding 
historical figure behind the series, he can be spotted in another room in the 
house that Bingham shares with his wife and creative partner, Linda. Lying on a 
table there is a collection of postcards of the father of the theory of 
evolution, Charles Darwin, and of his home in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 That place was one of the early destinations on the ambitious international 
shooting schedule for the $2-million series. Filming began last summer at 
Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's Virginia home, and finished this month. In 
between, Bingham and crew traveled to the Indonesian temple of Borobudur; 
locales in Bali, England and France, and key hubs of scientific research such 
as the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Stanford University's School of Medicine and 
the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, home of science's newest discipline, 
called complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting the show's considerable brain matter is what Bingham and his 
creative staff promise will be visual magic. In order to suggest, for instance, 
the theory that there may be a single controlling substance in the brain that 
makes consciousness possible, a view of a street in Ojai will be filmed as 
Bingham would see it on a walk. Then we will see Bingham sitting in the Ojai 
Playhouse movie theater, watching that scene on the big screen. "In essence," 
he says, "I play the role of homunculus, the little man in the brain." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Quest" quartet begins with a segment tentatively titled "The Nature of 
Human Nature," which reports on recent studies of how the mind and brain 
developed and evolved over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darwin," Bingham says, "proposed that our physical being is the result of 
evolution through natural selection. Unlike others -- including Alfred Russel 
Wallace, who co-discovered the natural selection theory -- Darwin included the 
brain in that process. And since the mind is part of the brain, mind and brain 
together was a package deal for Darwin." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other puzzles in mind-brain research is the question of why, if 
nothing in evolution happens before it is needed, our mind was capable of math 
skills at a time when the species was living in caves and forests. (UC San 
Diego philosophy scholar and author Patricia Churchland offers a possible 
answer: The brain was working hard in the bush and doing countless calculations 
to survive; now that part of the brain labors in the classroom and 
laboratories.) 
</P>
<P>
 The second segment, "Consciousness," will look into the still-murky area of 
consciousness, something Bingham says scientists didn't even touch 20 years ago 
-- "It was 'the C-word' back then." It is a subject now responsible for an 
explosion of books, and Bingham has talked with some of the important authors, 
among them Churchland ("Neurophilosophy"), Daniel Dennett ("Consciousness 
Explained") and Francis Crick ("The Astonishing Hypothesis"), the co-discoverer 
of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bingham, one of the segment's most compelling questions deals with the 
so-called binding problem: "How is our mind able to put together the shape with 
the color with the movement, and form it into an image we can make sense of? A 
very hot notion at the moment is that there may be an area or areas of the 
brain that act as a chorus of voices in synchrony, that this area links 
different brain areas together. It's all quite speculative." 
</P>
<P>
 (Ever mindful of visual metaphors, Bingham will suggest this with footage of a 
choir singing.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The Social Brain" is what Bingham is calling the third segment, which will, 
among other things, explore what various cultures have in common, such as 
facial expressions, tendencies toward aggression and altruism. It will even 
look at the search among scientists at Atlanta's Yerkes Regional Primate Center 
to discover if non-human primates have an innate sense of morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Any conversation with Bingham suggests, though, that he is especially excited 
about the fourth segment. Called "The Way of Science," it posits that the 
practice of science is itself a way to enlightenment, a never-ending quest for 
the ultimate answer to life -- "that formula explaining everything that you can 
stick on a T-shirt," as he puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that doing science is a kind of workaday holiness," Bingham says. 
"What I mean is that I don't think it's fair for religion and mysticism to 
corner the market on awe. Being able to comprehend nature, as Darwin did, is in 
a sense like reading the book of creation. The stories science tells have such 
incredible magnitude and importance that, frankly, make other world views 
rather pokey and medieval." 
</P>
<P>
 In physics, the quest has often been for the elusive Grand Unification Theory. 
The big story Bingham is after is complexity -- a field so new, so avant-garde, 
that this usually glib, erudite man hesitates giving a quick definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Complexity is the sort of thing Bingham loves -- making connections, the 
synthesizing of ideas. At Complexity U. -- the Santa Fe Institute -- Caltech 
physicist Murray Gell-Mann and a network of biologists, anthropologists, 
economists and ecologists are studying systems through nature, from ancient 
civilizations to rain forests, to find out why a simple system (such as a 
single cell) will explode into a complex one (such as multiple cells, the 
emergence of which set off massive development of life on Earth). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extraordinarily promising," Bingham says, "because if the study of 
complex adaptive systems finds a common pattern through nature -- simple to 
more complex, from grunts to language, from a wind to a hurricane, from barter 
to a global market economy -- it may hit on that big unifying idea science has 
always desired." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Crick is facing Roger Bingham, and the camera, operated by crack video 
men Mitch Wilson and Jack Combs, is running. The publicity-shy Crick rarely 
goes before a camera for anything. But here at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, 
where Crick works in the office once occupied by the late Jacob Bronowski, host 
of PBS' "The Ascent of Man," he is happy to put across his ideas on mind 
science to someone he respects. 
</P>
<P>
 It is something Bingham enjoys, as he is aware of his special relationship 
with the often-remote scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham belongs to the small band of science reporters who plow through vast 
amounts of scientific literature and distill the information for the rest of 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientists really do want to talk with him," notes Churchland of UC San 
Diego, "because they respect the fact that he really does his homework. He's 
one of the best there is. He has a wonderful tenacity to doggedly pursue a 
question until he finally figures it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham was born in 1948 in the seaside town of Blackpool in England's 
northwest. He was drawn to chemistry as a boy by a charismatic teacher; he 
jumped a few grades and later read chemistry at University College, London. He 
did not retire to the lab, however; in the watershed political year of 1968, he 
was president of the university's student union. "I was the moderate 
meditator," he says, "getting some basic student rights." 
</P>
<P>
 After he helped to plan and organize the first student-owned and -managed 
housing in Britain, Bingham met writer Ray Hawkey. "He asked me if I would do 
the science research for a novel he was writing, and I said I'd rather 
co-author it." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel, "Wild Card," set in an anarchic Los Angeles of the future, brought 
both writers to L.A. "on the day that the Symbionese Liberation Army was in the 
gun battle with the police," Bingham says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't too long after that I knew I wanted to live here. Everything was 
more relaxed than England, and I found American scientists more approachable 
than British ones." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Wild Card" appeared in 1974, Bingham devoted himself to writing about 
science. One of his magazine assignments -- a profile of Carl Sagan during the 
making of "Cosmos" at KCET -- brought him to the station he has been associated 
with since 1984. Eventually, after his work with Benti and the first science 
reports for KCET, Bingham persuaded the station to create a science production 
unit. With Linda, whom he married in 1984, as creative partner, Bingham turned 
the unit into his little factory for churning out several hours a year of 
scientific wit and wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Human Quest" is the ultimate product of the unit. It was axed in 1991, a 
victim of KCET production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Few TV journalists have sign-on access to Caltech's computer network, which 
Bingham faithfully rings into. It's another indicator of his ties to the 
scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We science communicators," Bingham says, "are ex-officio, honorary members of 
the scientific world. They let us in, talk about their ideas even before they 
publish, and that means that the ideas on the screen are going to be pretty 
fresh. And because we talk to specialists, it happens that we bring the 
specialists together to meet for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to name a few books that would give the viewer some background for "The 
Human Quest," he revealingly mentions works by those in his small band of 
reporters -- such as Matt Ridley and his daring new work "The Red Queen" and 
Roger Lewin and his witty primer "Complexity: Life at the Edge of Chaos." 
(Among Bingham's other suggestions, by scientists: Helena Cronin's "The Ant and 
the Peacock," Michael S. Gazzaniga's "Nature's Mind," Nicholas Humphrey's "A 
History of the Mind" and Melvin Konner's "The Tangled Wing.") 
</P>
<P>
 But since Bingham works on the tube, and thus for a much bigger audience than 
Ridley or Lewin, he feels that much more pressure: "You take on a 
responsibility -- it's also a great pleasure -- of passing on invigorating 
ideas. You see, especially in science reporting, you can't make mistakes. 
You've got to be factually accurate. I even had to make sure for a shot we were 
doing involving Descartes that we had the right meaning and spelling of his 
famous phrase ' cogito ergo sum ,' " -- or "I think, therefore I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing goes unchecked, which makes for a long production schedule. When both 
Linda and Roger explain how they are able to amass the information for the 
series ("Read a lot," they say in unison), it also points out that in 
television, "there's a point where you have to stop reading and start 
shooting," as series co-writer and co-producer Carl Byker says. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Byker -- a Writers Guild award-winning writer and producer (the 
1988 documentary "Power in the Pacific") -- was hired by KCET last year to help 
press production forward. "The Human Quest" has been on the KCET slate for a 
while: The original budgeting stretches back to 1991, and research-generated 
revisions have only stretched production out further. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone at KCET involved with "The Human Quest" marvels at the largess of 
thK. Whittier Foundation, which has contributed $1.5 million for the series -- 
an unusually large contribution, according to series executive producer Joyce 
Campbell. The only other funding, $500,000, came from KCET itself. 
</P>
<P>
 That forced such budget-cutting measures as shooting on videotape rather than 
film and forgoing a trip to India for the segment on consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "So," Bingham says as he walks along the shore just south of the Salk 
Institute, "you get inventive. In Indonesia, we were able to shoot at the 
Borobudur temple -- where we show a vision of nature, like complexity, though 
unlike science it's written in stone. In that same corner of the world, we 
could shoot the 'Wallace Line,' where Alfred Wallace had detected a division in 
species, caused as we know now by plate tectonics." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham waves off any concerns that his evolutionary-revolutionary themes will 
upset those viewers who hold to a literal interpretation of biblical creation. 
"We'll find that science is expansive, not reductive," he says, looking out at 
the setting sun. "If it's complexity or something else that will come up with 
answers to the Big Questions, we can't know. Whether they'll be answers that we 
like -- we can't know that either. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may not pay attention to the answers when they do come. Remember, 
Darwin's 'Origin of Species' came out in 1859, and millions of human beings 
still blow it off."

 When someone from a movie company says they're going to show you Los Angeles 
on the screen as you've never seen it before, the chance that this statement 
will turn out to be not entirely true is a distinct possibility. The filmmakers 
at the helm of the forthcoming TriStar movie "Devil in a Blue Dress" are now 
repeating those very words, but on the face of it, they seem to have more to 
promise than most. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted from the 1990 Walter Mosley mystery novel of the same title and 
starring Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals, "Devil in a Blue Dress" will 
show a side of the city that has not been much photographed by Hollywood: 
specifically, the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles just after World War II. 
The film, which has just finished shooting on locations around the city, is 
drawn from a story cast in the mold of film noir, but it is film noir peopled 
largely by working-class African Americans who in 1948, it will be remembered, 
were still living on the far side of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an unwritten code for black people at the time," says the film's 
director, Carl Franklin, who, like Mosley and Washington, is black. "You don't 
go north of Slauson Avenue, you don't go to Venice or Malibu. You don't go to 
Hollywood at night. You could get picked up (by the police). The movie we're 
making is set against a very racist milieu." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, 39, plays the part of Easy Rawlins, a World War II combat veteran 
and aircraft assembly-line worker who stumbles into a new line of work as a 
private detective when a tough-talking white man offers him money to locate a 
mysterious white woman known to frequent black jazz joints. Beals plays the 
part of the mysterious woman, who bears the noirish name of Daphne Monet. She 
has a secret, as readers of the novel already know and which the filmmakers 
would rather not advertise, at least until the movie opens sometime next 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday afternoon, Franklin and his cast were on location in a very 
white neighborhood of Pasadena, using the stately white stone main building of 
the private Mayfield Senior School as the setting for the foundation offices of 
Todd Carter, a wealthy businessman in love with Daphne who, at this point in 
the story, has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, 42, who grew up in Los Angeles but now lives in New York City, was in 
town to see how things were going and was pleased to discover that the set of 
Carter's office was exactly as he had originally imagined it.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is beautiful," said the author, who was wearing a black polo shirt as he 
sat in a sun-dappled garden on the baronial school grounds that in the 1940s 
were the private estate of silk thread manufacturer John Eagle. "I walk into 
the room and check out Carter's office, and when I went in there, I'm looking 
at the office that I wrote, right down to the bottle of brandy and the glasses. 
Pretty wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley wrote an early draft of the script himself when the movie was in 
development at another studio, but the screenplay being filmed was written by 
Franklin. This suits the author just fine. "I'm not a cinematic thinker," 
Mosley confided. Nevertheless, TriStar has retained him as an associate 
producer. "Basically Carl calls me up and asks questions. He had to change the 
name of a character the other day and he called me up and we talked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's cut out a few things. A couple of the characters have been combined. But 
I think he's been very true to the novel as a whole. I have no problem with the 
way he's changed it." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was published four years ago, "Devil in a Blue Dress" drew immediate 
attention to its young author and attracted movie interest from such actors as 
Danny Glover, Wesley Snipes and Tim Reid, all intrigued with the possibilities 
of playing Easy Rawlins, a heroic black protagonist chasing demons through the 
unexamined racism of post-war California. 
</P>
<P>
 But a movie did not get off the ground until producer Jesse Beaton happened 
upon the book and brought it to Franklin's attention about the same time that 
TriStar-affiliated director-producer Jonathan Demme saw Franklin's low-budget 
critical success "One False Move" and called to say he wanted to work with him. 
(Demme is executive producer of "Devil.") 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bill Clinton got elected President. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Clinton had already told members of the press that Mosley was one of 
his favorite writers, and the day after the election at least one national 
newspaper ran a front-page story speculating about what was going to be "in" 
once Clinton was in the White House -- a list that included the Easy Rawlins 
mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we sent that to (Mike) Medavoy," Franklin, 45, said with a big smile, 
referring to the then-chairman of TriStar. "I don't know exactly how much that 
had to do with anything, but everything seemed to move a little quicker after 
Clinton was elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley said he had not imagined Easy being played by any particular actor, 
though he is understandably pleased to see Oscar winner Washington in the role. 
"A lot of people you talk to, they say, 'Who do you see as Easy?' But I come 
from the theater where if someone tells you Laurence Olivier is going to play 
Hercules, you say, 'Gee, I wonder how he's going to do that?' That's the way I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 Beals, who was not in the day's scenes but had come to the set to watch, said 
she wanted the part of Daphne badly since first listening to the book on 
audiocassette while filming the upcoming "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" 
in New York. "Ugh! Did I read for it?" she said. "I jumped through burning hoop 
after burning hoop and watched as they got smaller. I never wanted a part like 
I wanted this part." 
</P>
<P>
 As a clutch of Mayfield's Catholic girls waited politely to get her autograph, 
Beals, 30, clad in casual black, stepped gingerly around what she called "the 
truth" about Daphne. "I don't know how much I can talk about it because it 
should be a surprise." She did say the role was proving difficult because "a 
character like this, there's no moment where I'm just sitting over a cup of 
coffee chatting with somebody. Every moment is a life-or-death situation, so 
it's pretty extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 The leading lady of "Flashdance" said the clothes she is wearing in "Devil in 
a Blue Dress," as the girlfriend of a wealthy man running for mayor, are "very 
alluring but very tasteful -- pearls. There is one dress that's a little more 
sensual, a little more degenerate." Daphne, she explained, "has to use the 
weapons that she has." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the changes that Franklin has made in the story is to build up Daphne's 
romance with Carter (played by Terry Kinney), who in the film is a somewhat 
younger character than in the book. "I didn't want this to be an older guy 
who's got this sweet thing," Franklin said. "I wanted it to be a situation 
where he might be losing a very vital love relationship. Especially with 
Jennifer. Jennifer looks like she could be the mayor's wife. She has that 
carriage." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Daphne's romantic fling with Easy in the novel evidently has 
been toned down. An erotic bathtub scene involving the two of them will not be 
in the movie. "It's a great scene; I love that scene," Beals said. "But no, 
it's not in the script. I'm not falling for Easy as much as I was in the book 
or as I was in the first drafts of the script. There's a lot of flirtation and 
a lot of tension. But who knows? With Carl, all of a sudden he could change it 
back and it would be in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although recognized by some as an actor who had a recurring role on "The A 
Team" and who made his first films with Roger Corman, Franklin demonstrated in 
"One False Move," an interracial crime thriller, that he could handle violence 
on the screen in a realistic but unspectacular way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming from an acting background, the emotions are more important to me. It's 
the invasion of humanity that I think is important about violence. It's not 
whether we have some neat way of killing somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 When things get truly desperate for Easy in the story, he gets some muscular 
help from an old childhood friend named Mouse (played by Don Cheadle, lately of 
television's "Picket Fences"). In the novel, Mouse is a key figure but in an 
earlier draft of the script he had been eliminated, with the thought that some 
of his action-hero qualities be grafted onto Easy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted Easy to be a stronger character," Franklin said of another 
studio's creative executives. "But that's not who Easy is. Easy's dilemma is 
that he's a guy who's fighting fear: the basic fears of a black person in 1948, 
problems with the police, being in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong time; 
afraid because he's been in the war and has killed, afraid of becoming like 
that again; afraid of being killed; afraid of becoming like Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he found a quick affinity for the story of "Devil in a Blue Dress" 
since its background details roughly parallel his own. Easy and many other of 
Mosley's characters are blacks who migrated from Texas and Louisiana during 
World War II to work in California's shipyards and defense plants. This is the 
story of Mosley's family and Franklin's as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Film noir is one of my favorite genres," the director said, "although I don't 
think you need to approach it as a genre when you do it. I like the '40s, I 
like detective kind of things. But what I never liked about them is the 
inaccessibility of the characters. Usually they're people that you never run 
into in real life. You know, where does (Phillip) Marlowe live? Who's his mom? 
Where did he come from? Same with the Continental Op or Sam Spade. The thing 
about these people is that they were all people I had seen before. Easy lives 
in a neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood is 103rd Street and Central Avenue in the area that later 
became known as Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Filming it as it was then has meant using other parts of the city that have 
undergone less change from urban decay, vandalism and supermarket make-overs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the filming has been done closer to downtown, near Pico, with 
buildings and streets in the area doctored to eliminate anachronisms like 
parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers had difficulty even locating many period photographs of Central 
Avenue to help them reconstruct its look. "We asked everybody involved in the 
production if they had any old family photos to bring them to us," said Jesse 
Beaton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is difficult because it's period," Franklin said, comparing this to his 
last picture. "It's a big film, there are a lot of characters, a lot of 
locations and it's all 1948. And we want to do it so that it's full of feeling 
and not just snippets of reality but big vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting it, we're getting it good, and everybody's having a good time. 
Denzel has been real cool to work with. The problem with Denzel is he wants all 
your research. He's just so into it. I ask somebody, where's my research? They 
say, 'Denzel's got it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When the cameras start rolling, Denzel Washington, dressed in 1940s suit and 
tie, makes his way across the spacious dark-paneled room that is actually the 
head of school's office at Mayfield but on this day is the headquarters of the 
Carter Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 Diego Rivera paintings hang on the wall. Leather-bound volumes fill the 
bookcases. The air smells of money. Carter gets up from his antique desk to 
greet Easy, whom events have transformed overnight from a lowly aircraft worker 
into an important black man standing square-shouldered in an inner sanctum of 
white power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Denzel," said a member of the crew gathered behind cinematographer 
Tak Fujimoto's video monitor. "That's actually a cheap suit he's wearing 
because that's what Easy would be able to afford, but on Denzel it looks GQ." 
</P>
<P>
 This was true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did something happen to Daphne?" Kinney asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I saw her she looked fine," Washington says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw her?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, last night." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is she still in town?" 
</P>
<P>
 "She was last night." 
</P>
<P>
 "What did she say, what was she wearing?" 
</P>
<P>
 "A blue dress and blue heels." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I've never known a woman who could wear perfume so slight. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Just then Washington takes the measure of this needy millionaire and sees 
something sad and unexpected. It's that moment in a mystery when the hero gives 
a look that says, "What have I gotten myself into?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, who had been looking on, said, "What genre is this that I'm writing 
in? It's harder to say than it seems. Because I'm packaged as a mystery writer, 
but I'm also writing about the history of Los Angeles. I'm writing about black 
people in America." 
</P>
<P>
 He has written three more books following the development of Easy Rawlins -- 
"A Red Death," "White Butterfly" and the just-published "Black Betty." He said 
he would rather be compared to Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to write about a social life, a linguistic life. I think the 
(hard-boiled detective) genre is about corruption. That's what Chandler was 
writing about: the end of the European man. The sense that his world doesn't 
work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley seemed to be in a good mood during this film -- financed visit to his 
hometown, watching his literary creatures come to life in a $20-million studio 
feature. But he said he was not ready to move back to the land of the palms. "I 
enjoyed 'Boyz N the Hood' and 'Menace II Society,' but I think that Hollywood 
has brought a hip-hop sensibility to black experience that is not true." 
</P>
<P>
 "Devil in a Blue Dress" presumably will be different? 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience with Hollywood is very clean," he said. "I don't have any 
expectations. I feel the way James M. Cain did when he was asked how he felt 
about what Hollywood had done to his novels. He said, 'My novels are right here 
on the shelf.' "

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; PANEL FAILS TO QUELL ADELANTE STUDY FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Try as they might, members of an advisory committee representing the community 
in an effort to revitalize areas of Boyle Heights and El Sereno could not 
convince more than 100 people who attended a meeting last week that their homes 
would not be targeted for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it on paper! We don't believe anything else!" said Paula Ramirez, who 
said she has lived in Boyle Heights for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wednesday night meeting at the Boyle Heights Senior Citizens Center was 
filled with angry and doubtful residents who have formed their own watchdog 
panel to oversee the Citizens Advisory Committee on the progress of the 
Adelante Eastside study. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, also called the Eastside Neighborhoods Revitalization Study, was 
completed 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are following through on study recommendations that commercial and 
industrial corridors be developed or enhanced to increase the local tax base. 
One of the study's findings was that most residents in a 10-square-mile area of 
Boyle Heights and El Sereno leave the area to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 It also found that most of the housing in the area is among some of the oldest 
in Los Angeles and in desperate need of repair. For now, officials have dropped 
the housing component of the revitalization effort and are focusing on the 
commercial and industrial corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents in those areas refuse to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many at the meeting said they are suspicious of a committee whose members have 
been appointed by 14th District Councilman Richard Alatorre. They called for 
the committee to be elected by the community or to be chosen from their group. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also have demanded a Spanish translation of the voluminous study, 
which the city's Community Development Department is completing, said project 
director Al Santillanes. The residents, led by the Legal Aid Foundation's East 
Los Angeles office that has conducted workshops on the study, have formed Union 
y Fuerza de la Comunidad and meet monthly to discuss their neighborhoods' 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern of the organization is the lack of representation," said 
Veronica Machado, who grew up in Boyle Heights but now lives in the San 
Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 "The reason is the simple fact that residents have not been informed of the 
study," she said, adding that she has also spoken to Whittier Boulevard 
business owners who were unaware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Citizens Advisory Committee members said that they too are concerned 
about the future of the neighborhood and volunteered for the panel to ensure 
that homes are spared, despite other potential development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now in Boyle Heights and East L.A., things are happening that you 
should know about," Santillanes told the audience. "You were told that your 
houses were in jeopardy. We're here to tell you that they're not, in our 
study."  
</P>
<P>
 The next Community Advisory Committee meeting will be at 6 p.m. July 27 at the 
El Sereno Senior Citizens Center, 4818 Klamath Place. The next meeting of the 
Union y Fuerza de la Comunidad is from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. July 16 at the 
Community Service Organization at 1st and Chicago streets. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CITY TERRACE; AFFECT OF PATROLS IS FOCUS OF MEETING

 Residents will hear firsthand Tuesday how increased law enforcement patrols in 
their neighborhoods have affected crime and safety.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Terrace Coordinating Council community meeting at St. Lucy's Catholic 
Church was called to address the efforts of the California Highway Patrol and 
Sheriff's Department over the past four months.In earlier meetings, the council 
had asked for increased patrols on their streets to stop speeding drivers near 
schools, catch drunk drivers and discourage teen-agers from loitering after 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Sheriff's Department announced a slight drop in crime in a 
7-square-mile area of City Terrace after issuing 246 tickets over the 
four-month period for curfew violations. Residents, some of whom had asked for 
the patrols out of concern for the teen-agers' safety, said they noticed a drop 
in youths hanging out at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highway Patrol also increased enforcement in May, ticketing 120 drivers 
for traffic violations from May 12-31 with an added patrol force and a sobriety 
checkpoint on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting begins at 7 p.m. at St. Lucy's, 3945 City Terrace Drive. MARY ANNE

CAPTURING THE CENTRAL AVE. 'EASY' FEELING

 For a brief moment it appeared as if the thriving Central Avenue of the '40s 
were alive again. Local nightclubs like the Downbeat and the Last Word were 
jumping, while Flo's Waffle Shop and the Lady Ebonee Beauty Center were open 
and ready for business.

 Passersby squinted and wondered if it could be. But it wasn't deja vu; it was

 Shot entirely on location in Los Angeles, the detective mystery "Devil in a 
Blue Dress" posed its own mysteries for Gary Frutkoff, the production designer 
in charge of creating Easy Rawlins' Los Angeles circa 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like private investigator Rawlins, Frutkoff found himself hunting down 
clues, trying to piece together a semblance of what post-World War II life was 
like in the predominantly black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A daunting task to be sure, for while a production designer typically has 
thousands of documents such as newspapers or magazines, photographs and 
histories to work from, Frutkoff found that documentation of the area was 
scanty at best; in fact, he was able to find only one photograph of the street 
he was asked to bring back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never been so frustrated," says Frutkoff, whose last movie was Steven 
Soderbergh's Depression-period piece "King of the Hill." "I was never able to 
find what I was looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Many personal photo collections, Frutkoff points out, were lost in the riots 
of both 1965 and 1992, while the newspaper covering the South-Central 
community, the Sentinel, had unfortunately lost or misplaced most of its photo 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
 The night life of Central Avenue is key to "Devil's" plot, as Rawlins winds 
his way through speak-easies and jazz clubs to track down Daphne Monet, the 
mysterious white woman with a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the lack of documentation available, it is difficult to envision 
Central Avenue as it once was. Considered the Harlem of the West Coast, the 
center of the California jazz scene, Central Avenue has even been credited as 
the cradle of be-bop. Duke Ellington used to play at the Lincoln Theatre and 
stay at the Dunbar Hotel there, and Billie Holiday performed at an after-hours 
club called Brother's. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a trip down this legendary street today reveals almost nothing of its 
past. "It's all knocked down, paved over. Central Avenue is a lost culture," 
Frutkoff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the production designer was determined to re-create the street's 
aura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We exhausted ourselves," he says. "I went all over the United States, to the 
Smithsonian and even to museums in New York, to see if there were any 
collections of Los Angeles that I could use." 
</P>
<P>
 He ended up depending on photographs from other places around the country and 
on oral history of residents of the area to fill in the details specific to 
black Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent about eight weeks of extensive research, interviewing ex-musicians 
and residents, anyone who could give us the real juice of what we were trying 
to get," Frutkoff says. "A lot of people got goose bumps from remembering how 
it was." 
</P>
<P>
 For the commercial area, Frutkoff relied on a 1942-46 directory of black-owned 
businesses. "For any business we re-created fictionally, we went back and 
cleared the names," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step was to find locations that could double not only for Rawlins' 
evening haunts but for his neighborhood as well. After scouting Oakland and 
Stockton, both cities Frutkoff thought might have the right look, he decided to 
stay in Los Angeles, settling for a few downtown blocks to stand in for Central 
Avenue and a residential block off West Adams Boulevard for Rawlins' 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-producer Jesse Beaton says one of her goals was to find a neighborhood that 
would define why Easy would want to stay to protect his community. "It's 
subtle," she says, "but you need to sense his connection." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Carl Franklin refused to consider shooting on a studio sound stage, 
Beaton says, because he felt "it wouldn't breathe in the same way -- on a sound 
stage the shades would be drawn and you wouldn't be able to look out the 
windows and see the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally planning to build Easy's home on a vacant lot, Frutkoff instead 
found that just what he wanted -- a small house built in the late '20s that 
Easy would have moved into just after World War II -- already existed. The 
home, a bit bigger than a bungalow and nestled behind a white picket fence on 
Harcourt Avenue, near the corner of Hickory Street, happened to have been owned 
and lived in by the same couple since 1947, who had just celebrated their 60th 
wedding anniversary. It was a perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with photographs from family albums of several private citizens and the 
Los Angeles Central Library, Frutkoff went to work setting the right tone for 
the interiors. All that really needed to be done was to wallpaper, re-tile the 
kitchen, de-modernize the bathroom and dig a back-yard garden where Easy tends 
his rose bushes. (The couple were paid for the use of their house and plan to 
move back in after the bathroom is remodernized.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rest of the working-class neighborhood, the houses and gardens 
needed only a little retouching -- and to have their iron burglar bars removed, 
in exchange for which residents received a 24-hour security patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 And aside from occasional interruptions from barking dogs and helicopters 
buzzing overhead, the shoot was peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 "This film is about Los Angeles," Beaton says, and about capturing on film an 
often-neglected aspect of Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Frutkoff acknowledges that "Los Angeles only goes back so far; 
every hour, every day, we lose history." 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, he views his work on "Devil in a Blue Dress" as "bigger than 
motion pictures. I feel like some kind of anthropologist -- or even an 
archeologist."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; HOPES BRIGHTEN FOR SECOND NEON GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Museum of Neon Art, which moved from Downtown to Universal City last year, 
could bring back its bright and flashy exhibits if the City Council approves a 
$415,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials intend to stay at Universal City but want to use most of the 
money to open a second, larger gallery on the ground floor of Renaissance 
Tower, a 192-unit apartment complex at 501 W. Olympic Blvd., said Gayle 
Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, which would also cover museum operating costs for five years, was 
offered by the agency to help revive the local arts scene in Downtown, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started talking to them to see if they'd be interested in re-establishing 
themselves back in (Downtown) Los Angeles," said David Riccitiello, a 
redevelopment agency project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made it clear to us that the space they have now at (Universal) CityWalk 
is much smaller than they really needed in order to effectively exhibit their 
collection," Riccitiello said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7,000 square feet of space available at the Renaissance Tower would meet 
the museum's need, he said. City Council members could vote on the 
redevelopment agency's proposal in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Neon Art, which collects electric signs and classic marquees 
such as the 43-foot Southern California Gas Co. flame, was a mainstay on 
Traction Avenue near Little Tokyo for 12 years, said director Mary Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 But temporary closure of the Temporary Contemporary Museum and the April, 
1992, riots contributed to a sharp drop in Neon Art's annual average of 15,000 
to 20,000 visitors, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum eventually closed in February, 1993, and looked elsewhere for a 
gallery. In May, it accepted an offer from MCA Development Co. to relocate to a 
rent-free building on Universal CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA also allowed museum officials to attach 25 neon signs along the facades of 
other buildings at CityWalk. The stretch, which leads to Universal Studios and 
Universal City Cineplex Odeon Theatre, attracts an estimated 8 million people a 
year, MCA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was intended to give people a taste of electric art," Carter said. "We 
have a small gallery there where we show changing exhibitions of fine art, and 
a small museum store." 
</P>
<P>
 She said thousands visit every week.  
</P>
<P>
 Though pleased with the CityWalk location, Carter said the 1,000-square-foot 
space "is not really sufficient to meet our exhibition needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum director believes a Renaissance Tower gallery could house an 
additional 25 to 30 pieces from the museum's historical collection and feature 
standing contemporary fine art shows and changing exhibitions. Some items to 
display could include a 13-foot, porcelain RCA sign with the image of the 
company's dog in white neon light and a portrait of Elvis and his guitar -- 
crafted by the museum's founder, Lili Lakich. 
</P>
<P>
 If funding for the gallery is approved, Carter also plans to use the site for 
its educational programs and invite students for special tours and neon art 
demonstrations.  
</P>
<P>
 Jon Peterson, president of the Downtown Arts Development Assn., said the 
Museum of Neon Art's return could help propel a resurgence of Downtown arts 
groups. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; STUDY BACKS MERITS OF LIGHT-RAIL STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A light-rail station linking key sites in Chinatown could be the most workable 
method to revive the deteriorating landmark community that over the years has 
lost clientele to the San Gabriel Valley, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-page report, commissioned last summer by a group of local business 
professionals, considers the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's proposed 
Pasadena Blue Line station at Alameda and College streets as a steppingstone 
toward an improved Chinatown.  
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to use the station as a focal point," said William Tan, president 
of the Chinatown Economic Development Council. "We can look at it sort of as 
half of a sun that radiates out to other locations." 
</P>
<P>
 Those sites, or "anchors," could be connected to the station via walkways or 
bridges. The locations include vacant lots in the 800 block of North Hill 
Street and the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Broadway, and property 
at Broadway and College Street -- all of which could make up a "clearly defined 
cultural and dining district," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also recommends incorporating the MTA station into a master plan and 
forming a Chinatown revitalization and development strategy for the community 
of 13,800 residents, 74.8% of whom are Chinese, according to the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's only a preliminary assessment, the report -- based on interviews 
with 15 Chinatown civic and business leaders and residents -- does not cover 
specific costs or details of what a cultural and dining district would look 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 It also does not include views from other ethnic minority groups, such as the 
Vietnamese and Latinos in and around Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan said his group did not have the funds for more thorough research. It was 
granted $5,000 from Kaiser Permanente health care to hire Leadership Education 
for Asian Pacifics Inc. for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a discussion piece, not so much as a solution," Tan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinatown has been searching for ways to rid the negative perception of the 
community as a crowded and unsafe area with high land prices, dirty streets and 
few parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increased language skills, availability of land at affordable prices, good 
schools and changing values acted as 'pull factors,' attracting Chinese 
families out of the urban core and into communities in the San Gabriel Valley," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wayne Louie, vice president of the Chinatown Economic Development 
Council, criticized the Community Redevelopment Agency for failing to establish 
a vision for Chinatown when 330 acres were tabbed redevelopment property in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you plan a community, how can you talk about putting in a light-rail 
station without a (master plan)?" Louie said. "The exodus of people from the 
community, it's also a reflection of a lack of planning." 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment agency officials said no master plan was created because the 
agency followed a general city planning strategy that focused on zoning, land 
use and improvement of public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, however, the agency has been working on a five-year plan for 
Chinatown, which is scheduled to be completed by September, said Don Spivack, 
the agency's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our perspective, we have accomplished a great deal, particularly in the 
area of upgrading and expanding housing development," Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years, the agency has spent $1.2 million in street repairs 
and tree plantings, and another $10,500 for 100 bilingual street signs, 
redevelopment agency officials said. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; UNION CHURCH WILL HOUSE ASIAN ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has approved a 44-year lease that allows a local 
partnership group to turn the historic city-owned Union Church on San Pedro 
Street into an Asian arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real excited," said Erich Nakano, project manager for Little Tokyo 
Service Center."The project will really contribute to revitalizing Little Tokyo 
and the cultural life of Downtown and the region." 
</P>
<P>
 The social service center and Visual Communications, an Asian American media 
organization, formed the Old Union Church General Partnership two years ago in 
the hope of developing the three-story church at 120 N. San Pedro St., Nakano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Asian Pacific Arts Center, the 9,000-square-foot brick building 
will house Visual Communications and L.A. Artcore, a museum featuring emerging 
artists, as well as East West Players, one of the leading Asian American 
theater companies in the country, Nakano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease agreement requires the partnership to pay $1 a year to the city. In 
exchange, the group will spend $4.9 million to renovate and seismically 
retrofit the building, which was in the Northridge quake, Nakano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the remodeling project will come from federal and local agencies, 
including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency. It could open as early as fall, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1923 and known as the oldest Christian church in Little Tokyo, Union 
Church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was purchased 
by the city in 1978 after congregation members moved to their present site at 
401 E. 3rd St. TOMMY LI

PHOTOGRAPHY; WELCOME TO OPIE'S WORLD; FOR ARTIST CATHERINE OPIE, HER 
PHOTOGRAPHS ARE 'ABOUT COMMUNITY.' HER CURRENT EXHIBITION IN WEST HOLLYWOOD 
PAYS TENDER TRIBUTE TO HER LESBIAN FRIENDS. BUT IT HAS ALSO STIRRED UP THE ART 
WORLD AND A FEW OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, Kristine McKenna is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Catherine Opie realized she was a lesbian in high school, but it took her a 
while to come to grips with the fact. Growing up in Rancho Bernardo, a suburban 
community near San Diego, Opie was the youngest of two children in what she 
describes as "a proper family." 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was a very conservative Republican businessman, so obviously I 
considered it a problem when I realized I was a lesbian," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get as far away from home as possible after I graduated from high 
school because I had a hard time being a kid," she said referring both to 
school and home. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to San Francisco in the early '80s, Opie put a fair amount of miles 
between herself and her childhood and began to become comfortable with her 
sexuality; on her own at last, she also discovered another aspect of her 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started hanging out with people in the leather community when I was in my 
early 20s and it really felt right to me," says Opie, who now lives in lower 
Koreatown. "At first it was a little scary to me and I thought, 'This is sick, 
I'm a pervert,' but I soon realized those beliefs were something I'd been 
taught and they really had nothing to do with the experience I was having. The 
leather scene was about community for me, and I was inspired by all these 
people who were giving themselves the freedom to image themselves however they 
saw fit." 
</P>
<P>
 A student at the San Francisco Art Institute at the time, Opie was taking 
photographs in the social documentary tradition then. It wasn't until several 
years later, well after she'd earned a master's degree at Cal Arts, that she 
realized this most personal aspect of her life -- her sexuality and the leather 
community she was part of -- could serve as rich raw material for her work. 
</P>
<P>
 On view at Regen Projects in West Hollywood through Saturday, "Portraits" is 
the first gallery exhibition of Opie's ongoing photographic essay on what some 
see as the radical faction of the gay community. Among her subjects are Sky and 
Mike, two female transsexuals who take hormones that enable them to grow 
beards; male transvestites, and butch lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Like L.A. performance artists Bob Flannagan and Ron Athey, Opie takes us into 
an exotic world of elaborate tattoos, piercings, ritualized sexuality, 
role-playing and cross-dressing. This is likely the most in-your-face 
contingent of what Opie refers to as "queer culture" (queer is currently the 
appellation of choice for many gays and lesbians, who use it as a way of 
reclaiming a word that's traditionally been used derogatorily). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make myself look this way to get attention," says Opie who appears in 
the photograph on the announcement for her show as a mustachioed man named Bo, 
one of several alter egos she plays with within the context of the leather 
community. "I do it because it's an expression of having control over my own 
body, and it makes a statement within my community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started developing personas when I began playing in the leather community 
in the early '80s, and Bo's a character I just fell in love with," she says, 
gesturing toward the life-size portrait of Bo on the back wall of the gallery. 
"He represents the quiet, psychopath side of me and is a way for me to play 
with ideas Cathy would never be able to play with. I kind of think of him as a 
serial killer from the Midwest who's a used aluminum-siding salesman," she 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm playing a character with Bo -- he just gives voice to 
another part of my mind that I know is there," she adds. "We all have different 
personas living inside us -- I have another one named Mistress Catherine who's 
a high femme mistress, for instance, and I plan to photograph her soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to make this part of my life the subject of my art because it's 
what I believe in, and historically, I feel it's important that this body of 
work be done," says Opie, who supplements her income with a full time job at UC 
Irvine where she runs the photography lab. "I've never seen portraits like this 
before that are so loving of the leather community, even though it's existed 
for a really long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Sandusky, Ohio in 1961, Opie describes herself as "kind of a twisted 
social documentary photographer," who, at age 9, was inspired to start taking 
pictures after seeing the work of Lewis Hine. "I figured out what child labor 
laws meant by looking at his photographs and that same year got my own camera 
and went around documenting my neighborhood in Ohio -- we lived there until I 
was 13, when we moved to Rancho Bernardo." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleeing Southern California as soon as the opportunity afforded itself, Opie 
spent an unhappy year of high school at a private girls' school in Virginia, 
then settled for five years in San Francisco after graduating. During her 
college years at the San Francisco Art Institute, and later at Cal Arts, Opie 
admired the discreetly political photographs of artists such as Walker Evans 
and Dorthea Lange, and took pictures in a similar social documentary vein that 
explored ideas of community and identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a two-year project on the development of master-planned communities and 
how they've led us to perceive suburbia as a reflection of the '50s," says 
Opie, "and I also did a series on MacArthur Park and the development of the 
Metro Rail that was exhibited at Beyond Baroque (in Venice) in 1989. Those 
bodies of work might not seem to have any connection to the work I'm doing now, 
but in fact, all my work has been autobiographical," she adds. "The 
master-planned communities series, for instance, was about me leaving Ohio and 
going to live in one of them in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years she was making that work, Opie also took photographs, often 
of a sexual nature, of her friends in the leather community, but she never 
considered exhibiting them. "Taking those pictures was a way for me to keep my 
work connected to my community while I was taking social documentary 
photographs of other communities, but somehow they never satisfied me as an 
artist," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Opie began to look for a way to interweave the disparate aspects of her life 
and work during the '80s when artist like Cindy Sherman and Robert Mapplethorpe 
gained increasing visibility. Sherman's work may be the closest to Opie's in 
its use of portraiture as a means of exploring issues of identity. Donning a 
series of disguises and costumes, and frequently impersonating figures from 
history, Sherman herself serves as the model for all her photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mapplethorpe, on the other hand, photographed an underground world largely 
unknown to those outside of it. "Mapplethorpe was the first artist to try to 
aestheticize the queer community, so he was a pretty big influence on me," she 
points out. Mapplethorpe's voice does echo ever so faintly in Opie's work -- 
the two artists clearly have similar intentions, but there are significant 
differences in their work as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Both artists' work is rooted in formalism, has a decidedly cool tone and is 
painstakingly composed; Opie, however, employs blazing color, while 
Mapplethorpe's most critically acclaimed work was done in black and white. Then 
there's the issue of scale -- Opie's photographs are approximately life-sized 
(a strategy that makes them a little bit eerie), while Mapplethorpe's work 
conforms to the usual scale of photographs. There's a marked difference in 
emotional tone as well; Mapplethorpe's work is informed by an iciness that's 
altogether absent in Opie's curiously tender portraits. And finally, 
Mapplethorpe's portraiture is more sexually explicit and often depicts 
interactions between more than one subject, while Opie's portraits center on a 
lone subject who stares into the camera with a neutral expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "These aren't snapshots of somebody smiling at a party -- these pictures 
confront you with a straightforward gaze that can be a bit unnerving," Opie 
points out. "I always give a print to everybody I photograph, and some of my 
subjects have told me they have a hard time hanging them up at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she sees portraiture of this nature as an open-ended road or as a 
limited approach destined to exhaust itself, Opie says, "I'll keep taking 
portraits like this as long as I have images in my head -- and the images in my 
head are sparked by the people I know. These photographs are really a 
collaboration between my friends and I." 
</P>
<P>
 Opie also continues to take photographs of a social documentary nature, and 
she's currently at work on a series on landscape, Los Angeles freeways, houses 
built in the Hollywood Hills during the '50s, '60s and '70s, and lesbian 
domesticity (a series she says is composed of "pictures of women in their homes 
together"). Her portraits of the gay community, however, are far and away her 
most critically acclaimed work and have created something of a sensation in the 
art world. Printed in editions of eight, the photographs on view at Regen 
Projects are selling briskly, and her solo debut at a New York gallery is 
slated for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she feels the success of this work is attributable in part to the 
fact that many people may be drawn to it as a kind of freak show, Opie says, "I 
think this work has gotten more attention than previous bodies of work I've 
done because I've grown up as an artist. The work is more considered, and 
speaking purely in technical terms, the photographs are simply better. Of 
course, you can't discount the subject matter, and some people probably do come 
expecting a freak show, but if they're genuinely interested in art and they 
look at it with any care, I think the work becomes something more than that for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work elicits a diverse range of responses," she continues, "but most 
straight people I've talked to said they appreciated its dignity and honesty. 
Yes, some people are threatened by it -- we're taught that when we get a wound 
or scratch our knee, something's wrong, so obviously many people are going to 
be disturbed by the things that are done with the body in the leather 
community. But amazingly enough, I've never been attacked for my work on 
grounds of content. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, lesbians haven't had a culture," Opie points out. "Gay males 
have a well documented history that stretches far back into history, but 
lesbians have been invisible within that culture -- this is something that's 
changed radically over the past 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesbians may have gained a higher profile in mainstream culture over the past 
10 years, but the existence of female-to-male transsexuals within the lesbian 
community will still no doubt come as a surprise to some (the lesbian 
transsexual community includes women who use hormones in order to develop 
secondary male sexual characteristic, as well as women who use hormones in 
tandem with various cosmetic surgical procedures). 
</P>
<P>
 "Female-to-male hormone use is a procedure that started about five or six 
years ago, and though some people within the lesbian community condemn it, the 
leather community has embraced it because they've always supported anything 
having to do with the freedom to change one's body and appearance," Opie 
explains. "People should be aware, however, that this is not a fad -- this is a 
process that people think about for a really long time before committing to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 One could make the case that an artist's sexuality comes into play in his or 
her work regardless of intent; nonetheless, in this era of political 
correctness, one often hears such phrases as "lesbian art" bandied about. Asked 
if she believes there is such a thing (a question that's explored in depth in 
the June issue of Art in America, which features interviews with 12 gay and 
lesbian artists), Opie says, "There's a lesbian aesthetic, just as there's gay 
camp, but I don't know if there's such a thing as 'lesbian art.' There've been 
quite a few shows in recent years curated around the theme of lesbianism, and 
while those shows are valuable, they also ghettoize the work they're showing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started making work I tailored it for the heterosexual community 
because I was terrified I'd never have a career if I didn't," she concludes, 
"but I've come to believe that the role of a gay artist in a predominantly 
heterosexual culture is to remain true to themselves and their beliefs. Things 
have changed a lot for gays and lesbians over the past decade, but it's still a 
big deal to be queer. You can still get bashed and there's still an enormous 
amount of consciousness raising to do."

</P>

<P>
 The late Philip Vera Cruz, a founder of the United Farm Workers union, never 
realized his dream of a college education, but many Filipino Americans remember 
him as a working man with a degree in justice and equality. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always talked about how important it is to get an education and get 
involved in causes," said longtime friend Roy Morales, program director of the 
Pacific Asian Alcohol Program. "To us he's a folk hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said Vera Cruz, who died June 11 at 89, was a quiet man "except when 
he was organizing. He was a dynamic speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a genuine ability to take a complex or radical program and make it 
sound like homespun common sense," said Nate Santa Maria, a UCLA graduate 
student who plans to follow in Vera Cruz's footsteps as a union organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Asian American and labor activists, Vera Cruz had "a tremendous network 
of friends," said Kent Wong, director of the UCLA Labor Center and president of 
the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philip was quite a remarkable man," Wong said. "He devoted his life to 
organizing workers and he symbolizes the story of his generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Cruz planned to go to college when he came to the United States in 1926, 
but the jobs he took to support his parents and siblings back in the 
Philippines left no time or money for formal studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Working the low-wage, sweaty jobs once reserved for immigrants, Vera Cruz met 
other Filipino men known as the manong , first-generation immigrants who came 
in search of a brighter future and toiled most of their lives in fields, 
factories and canneries on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1960s, stirred by the injustices he and his fellow farm workers 
suffered, Vera Cruz helped form an organizing committee, made up mainly of 
Filipinos, which led a series of strikes in Coachella and Delano. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, the Filipinos were joined by the more numerous Mexican workers led by 
Cesar E. Chavez. By 1966 the groups merged to form the United Farm Workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists working in a multiethnic setting should pay heed to Vera Cruz's 
example, said Meg Thornton, a projects coordinator at the UCLA Asian American 
Studies Center. He and his fellow farm workers "went beyond their own ethnic 
politics to form a union based on common ground," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Vera Cruz became a vice president of the union but resigned in 1977, angered 
by what he believed to be the union's lack of democracy and its closed 
leadership circle. The final straw was Chavez's 1977 meeting with President 
Ferdinand Marcos, who had declared martial law in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those years, I was fighting for equality and justice, but I never got 
there," Vera Cruz said in a 1992 interview. "I still want to get close to it. 
And bring my people closer to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance honored Vera Cruz in 1992 as a 
labor-movement pioneer, one of the many tributes he received late in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He joined in the march at our founding convention," Wong said. "There he was 
at 87, still in great spirits, still at the front of the march." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the accolades he earned for his leadership skills, Vera Cruz always 
stressed that a movement must go beyond its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember he said that the cause is the most important thing, not the 
leadership," said Joel Jacinto, executive director of Search to Involve 
Pilipino Americans, a community service agency. "We place so much emphasis 
today on leadership style but the UFW was about collective action." 
</P>
<P>
 The history of Filipinos in America and the UFW "hasn't really been told," 
Jacinto said. "Our challenge now is to bring to light this history and (Vera 
Cruz's) role in it." JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; JANITORS CLAIM THEY ARE OWED $120,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A workers' advocacy group claims that a Koreatown-based cleaning company has 
failed to pay at least 16 subcontractors for janitorial work performed during 
the last two years, but an attorney representing the company says the region's 
floundering economy is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates claims that A-1 Building Maintenance 
Co. owes more than $120,000 in unpaid wages to janitors who bought cleaning 
contracts from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 A-1 originally purchased the contracts from building owners and then found 
subcontractors to do the work, a common practice in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The janitors "were given keys to clean buildings all over Los Angeles County 
but after a few months their pay slowed and then in some cases they wouldn't 
receive anything at all," said Paul Lee, a KIWA organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nam Min Cho, one of the subcontracting janitors, claims he is owed more than 
$30,000 for work completed between 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When the subcontractors complained to company president Jin Yang, they were 
told that the pay was delayed because of the company's low cash flow, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least seven other janitors employed directly by A-1 also claim they are 
owed back wages, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Bleau, an attorney representing Yang, said the subcontractors' claims 
against the company were "unfounded." He declined to discuss specific cases, 
but said that in general if payment problems arise it is because a building 
owner has not paid the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleau noted that several buildings that have had contracts with A-1 are 
suffering high vacancy rates and some businesses have closed down and have not 
paid their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "A-1 Building Maintenance Co. has been victimized by a bad economy, and the 
subcontractors are blaming Mr. Yang for a bad economy," Bleau said. "It's a 
shame for these people but it's also a shame for my client. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (A-1) doesn't get paid, no one gets paid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee disputed the company's characterization of the problem: "They are trying 
to displace the burden of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal claims filed by some of the subcontractors have been tied up in court 
and few of the plaintiffs can afford the legal fees, Lee said. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; WOMEN FILMMAKERS LEND HAND TO TEENS

 Michele Ohayon and Tyis Conners had little reason to meet before last month. 
Separated by distance, money and age, the two shared little in common except 
for a vision of women in film. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Ohayon, a 34-year-old film director from Los Feliz, and Conners, a 
14-year-old 10th-grader, spend at least two hours each Saturday discussing 
filmmaking as part of a series of workshops aimed at giving South-Central 
teen-agers a taste of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt that we live in a community and we can't just isolate our fears," 
said Ohayon. "There are a lot of people whom we have the power to help."  
</P>
<P>
 Ohayon, whose credits include "It Was a Wonderful Life," a documentary about 
homeless women in Beverly Hills, is a member of Cinewomen, a group of women 
filmmakers who assist women in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Cinewomen launched a free eight-week course for teens that 
includes acting, directing and post-production editing workshops, as well as 
visits to a special-effects studio. About 15 members of Cinewomen are working 
with the youths at the Challenger Boys and Girls Club, 5029 S. Vermont Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohayon conceptualized the workshop program while researching South-Central 
youth film programs for a documentary. "I realized there were no hands-on 
programs to teach youths about films," she said. "I decided I wanted to do 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may feel a little awkward as a white woman, and I'm not trying to be their 
role model, but we can't wait until there are black filmmakers coming here. 
Because it's a Catch-22: There are so few." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Ohayon and other women filmmakers approached Kenny Rogers, a 
project coordinator for the leadership training program at the Challenger Club, 
about the workshops. He agreed to help select a dozen 13- to 17-year-olds to 
participate.  
</P>
<P>
 The results have been great, according to Rogers, who said the would-be 
filmmakers are learning that Hollywood needs them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that what Cinewomen is trying to tell them is that there is room for 
them in that industry," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to know that the film industry is not a closed world, just for 
white people in Hollywood," Ohayon said. Ohayon added that while many of the 
students may not pursue film careers, they will learn basic skills, such as 
improving their writing, which will help "give them the tools to express 
themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 For Tyis, the purpose of the workshops is simple: to fine-tune her writing 
skills. "This has given me a better outlook on how to develop story-lines and 
the characters, and the tone I want to put in the script," said Tyis, who is 
working on her second script.  
</P>
<P>
 Ohayon said Cinewomen members hope to continue the program this fall, but its 
future is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The program runs without any funding other than the donations of Cinewomen 
members.  
</P>
<P>
 "We approached many companies about donating equipment," Ohayon said, "but 
(they) didn't want to give us equipment when they heard it was going to 
South-Central." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 Michael McMeel believes adoption isn't just for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills entrepreneur and former musician has come up with his own 
adoption program, one that pairs corporate sponsors and community leaders with 
empty buildings as part of a plan to refurbish abandoned sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wandering around South-Central, and I realized there is all this wasted 
space," said McMeel, who heads the nonprofit Awareness Foundation, which works 
with community groups and youths to provide student field trips. "After the 
riots, people talked about 'We need to build in South-Central,' but there are 
already tons of buildings there that just need to be fixed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, started by McMeel in 1992, is asking corporate sponsors to 
adopt vacant buildings and turn them into learning centers, much the way that 
businesses and community leaders have adopted stretches of highways for litter 
and graffiti removal.  
</P>
<P>
 McMeel said he is not looking just for cash donations but materials that 
companies no longer use -- such as computers, desks and other supplies -- for 
the centers. The Discovery Centers project would refurbish the vacant sites 
with the help of volunteers, who would also staff them. Computer, art and other 
classes would be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has received the endorsement of Mayor Richard Riordan, 
Councilman Mike Hernandez and others who appear in a short film McMeel has 
produced about the foundation. The film will be used to raise funds for the 
centers, McMeel said, adding that the project has not been able to attract a 
large corporate sponsor.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is displaying a will to do something that we need," said Hernandez, who 
met McMeel when the entrepreneur began attending City Council meetings in 1992. 
"He has faith in corporate America, and that's what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he is working with McMeel to assist other youth organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting sponsors has been difficult. Sitting in his Sunset Boulevard office, 
McMeel pointed to a stack of rejection letters from banks, corporations and 
others, who have cited shrinking budgets and an increase in the number of 
organizations looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard. People don't realize that to the degree that they ignore the 
problems out there, that will be the degree that it comes back to hit them in 
the head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMeel has, however, met with some success at the Vermont Square United 
Methodist Church at Vernon and Budlong avenues. Church leaders and McMeel have 
been discussing the possibility of using an empty three-story building owned by 
the church as the first Discovery Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need alternatives and places to go for hope and that's what attracted 
me to the idea of the Discovery Center," said the Rev. Kenneth Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 McMeel said he approached Waters shortly after the 1992 riots with the idea of 
making a documentary film that would help focus attention on South-Central. 
That led to the church appearing in McMeel's film, "A Light Still Shines," and 
to talks about the church housing the first Discovery Center at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, there is a need in this community," Waters said. "There are 
needs for job training, job education and recreational activity, needs for some 
alternative for our young people to prevent the loitering."

<P>
 A diamond in the rough may soon become the star of Martin Luther King Park. 
The Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles has awarded the park and Little 
League Baseball Inc. a $69,000 grant for the construction of a baseball 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully (this) will help put a facility there because there is a lack of 
good facilities in the area for the kids," said Barry Zepel, a spokesman for 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to upgrade the current baseball diamond as well as 
build bleachers by April, 1995, at the park at 3916 Western Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no regulation Little League facility in the South-Central area," said 
Jackie Tatum, general manager for the city's Department of Recreation and 
Parks. "We have ball diamonds but there is no Little League field with two 
dugouts and a grass infield."  
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the improvements and stands is about $169,000, Tatum said. The 
city will use additional donations from the Hilton Foundation and the Los 
Angeles Dodgers to refurbish the diamond.  
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Foundation, whose funding comes from the surplus of the 
1984 Los Angeles Olympics, awards grants to youth sports programs and 
organizations. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: SOUTHWEST; TRIP GIVES CADET A NEW VIEW OF D-DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To 17-year-old Charles Butler, generations removed from World War II, D-day 
was something that lived only on a page in a history book. 
</P>
<P>
 But after touring England earlier this month and taking part in events 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-day, Butler says the massive military 
offensive mounted by Allied forces on June 6, 1944, lives in him now. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people lost their family and friends," said Butler, a Southwest Los 
Angeles resident and Hamilton High student. "They stood around me crying. . . . 
It's very real for them, like it happened yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was one of 24 ROTC naval cadets from the American Southwest chosen by 
ROTC officials to make the two-week trip abroad earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The group traveled to several English ports, saw President Clinton and French 
President Francois Mitterand at D-day events and heard testimonies -- many of 
them eyewitness accounts of D-day -- by veterans and civilians from Canada, 
France and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran told Butler he parachuted to the wrong spot, about 20 miles north 
of the appointed place on Normandy beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he said it turned out good, because he wound up fighting and making a 
difference anyway," Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
 And while the cadets performed military drills for such royalty as the Queen 
Mother and Prince Philip, they were getting the red-carpet treatment from the 
British. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were treated like royalty," said Butler, the only African American in his 
group. "They saw us as diplomatic guests, even though we're young. It was kind 
of a shock to come back here and be treated like a kid again."  
</P>
<P>
 Butler and the cadets stayed on the Bristol, a British destroyer, and toured 
Southampton and London. He visited the Tower of London, the Crown Jewels and 
the room where Dwight Eisenhower mapped out D-day strategies with other 
military commanders.  
</P>
<P>
 But Butler said the most enduring experience will be honoring D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for D-day," he said, "the Germans might have won the war. And 
the world would be a very different place today." ERIN J. AUBRY

 In front of a tree-shaded home on 3rd Avenue in Leimert Park, what Councilman 
Mark Ridley-Thomas called prime real estate, city officials and financiers 
announced a home loan program designed to increase home ownership in the inner 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give deserving people the chance to buy a decent new place to 
live," said Ridley-Thomas, who spent a year coordinating the program, called 
Home Works! 
</P>
<P>
 "For too long, people have associated affordable housing with rental units and 
projects. We need to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 The city-sponsored program gets its $100 million in loan capital from Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Three financial institutions -- Countrywide Funding Corp., First Interstate 
Bank and black-owned Family Savings Bank -- will originate and underwrite the 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying low- to middle-income home buyers will be able to finance up to 95% 
of a home purchase, as well as take out interest-free loans for rehabilitation 
and home improvement through the city's Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas, who chairs the City Council's Housing and Redevelopment 
Committee, said the program will help ensure that the economic foundation of 
the community -- home ownership -- is strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some inner city areas have deteriorated, he noted, South-Central was 
one of the few areas in California where property values have increased 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to see neighborhoods on the edge not fall over, we must have 
programs like this one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home Works! will help not only first-time buyers, but homeowners who may be 
facing foreclosure and need help," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; TRIAL TO DECIDE LAND DEAL, CLEANUP OF 
SITE

 5614 Shull St. is a mess in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant 1.5-acre industrial parcel is overgrown with grass and trees, which 
provide shade for homeless who squat there. Black drums of soil samples sit in 
rows and an open pit marks the spot where an underground storage tank was once 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city tests, the soil where the 24-foot-long tank was buried is 
contaminated with a combination of cleaning solvent and a petroleum-based 
liquid that may have seeped into the ground-water aquifer. Nobody is quite sure 
of the extent of the contamination, where it exactly came from, or -- most 
important -- who should clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is pointing fingers right now," said Anthony R. Ybarra, Bell Gardens 
director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has spent more than $500,000 to find out what is going on below the 
surface of the land it purchased for $595,000 from Herbert B. and Judith E. 
Brohn of Red Bluff in 1985. The city is suing the couple, who once owned 
controlling interest in the Berk Oil Co., which used the land as a supply yard 
and maintained the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The city filed its lawsuit in Norwalk Superior Court in 1992 to force the 
Brohns and Berk Oil to pay for the cleanup, which could exceed $1 million. 
Because the soil is tainted, the land is virtually unsalable and unusable, the 
city claims. The city bought the land with the intention of building affordable 
housing, Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Brohns have countersued the city, saying that the purchase 
agreement came with an "as is" clause that protects them. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is scheduled Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city's lawsuit, the Brohns told them that they had cleaned 
out the tank, filled it with sand and paved it over. But four years later, 
consultants hired by the city pried open the tank and found that it still held 
drums of contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a surprise to everybody," said Robert Lemen, attorney for BCL 
and Associates, the consulting firm that conducted the 1985 soil studies and 
has been named in the city's suit for negligence. "Everyone had assumed the 
sump (tank) was clean and empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemen said that BCL's soil study was not negligent and that the consultants 
noted contamination in their report and gave the city a $21,000 estimate for 
the cleanup. But the city, Lemen said, did nothing until it discovered the tank 
was leaking four years later and the contamination had spread. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Metal Craft Co., which once owned the property next door to Berk 
Oil, is also defending itself against allegations by the Brohns that it 
contributed to the contamination. Pacific Metal Craft still operates there but 
the city now owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who says there is more contamination now (than in 1985) is just 
guessing," Lemen said. "It is a matter of much speculation among experts." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of problem going on all over the L.A. Basin," said Vicki 
Land, an attorney for the city. Land said that the aquifer, which may have been 
contaminated, is not used for any type of consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, after the city discovered that the contamination had spread, it 
stopped its $5,266 monthly payment to the Brohns. While the city ultimately 
seeks to nullify the land deal and get its money back as well as punitive 
damages, the Brohns are asking for $452,000 -- the remaining balance of the 
original purchase price -- in a lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert Einstein ruled last month that the Brohns are not 
responsible for the cleanup, but this month he reversed himself. BOB ELSTON

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; THE HEARTSICK LIFE OF HO HOANG; A VIETNAMESE FATHER 
STRUGGLES TO PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY IN CHINATOWN. HIS PLIGHT IS TYPICAL OF HIGH 
NUMBERS OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES ENMESHED IN THE WELFARE 'SAFETY NET.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taped to the wall of Ho Hoang's Chinatown apartment is a handwritten 
Vietnamese proverb that in English means: "On the outside, things look pretty. 
But on the inside, there's misery." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Hoang and his 12-year-old twin daughters, Tam and Thien, gather on the 
floor of their virtually barren apartment, their eyes can't disguise the 
sadness that comes from years of poverty, misfortune and family separations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Hoang arrived in the United States with his mother and 
daughters with the hope of settling into a comfortable life and eventually 
sending for the girls' mother in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family still depends on $800 a month in welfare because Hoang's heart 
is failing and he can't find a job. The girls' mother , who is Hoang's second 
wife, can't leave Vietnam. And Hoang -- a slight man with skeletal features and 
sullen eyes -- is haunted by memories of spending three years in a Communist 
re-education camp, where he was tortured, starved and brainwashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighed with such burdens, the 57-year-old immigrant now believes his only 
option is to give his daughters away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my daughters very much, but if some family would take care of them, I 
would sign the papers," Hoang said through an interpreter, as his eyes filled 
with tears. "I don't want to see my daughters grow up in poverty. . . . Life is 
not bright for me. I just want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hoang, many recent Southeast Asian refugees arrived in the United States 
with dreams of prosperity, but are now living in despair and poverty. Along 
with speaking little or no English and having limited education and job skills, 
many Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian and other Southeast Asian refugees carry 
horrifying war memories that make it difficult for them to adapt to a new 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently released UCLA report found that a higher percentage of Southeast 
Asians in California receive welfare benefits than any other ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of Southeast Asian adults in California live in households that 
receive Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), according to the 
report, which was issued by UCLA's Asian American Studies Center and the 
nonprofit group Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics. And while Southeast 
Asians are only 13% of the total Asian American population in California, they 
account for up to 87% of Asian Americans on welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 "Given the multitude of problems ranging from the lack of English-language 
ability to pre-immigration trauma, it is inevitable that a large percentage of 
refugees would rely on this 'safety net,' " the report said. And "once within 
the welfare system, many have a difficult time escaping." 
</P>
<P>
 The first large wave of Southeast Asian refugees started coming to the United 
States in 1975, after the end of the Vietnam War. Between 1975 and 1978, 
178,000 refugees arrived, mostly from Vietnam and some from Laos. More than a 
million Southeast Asians now live in the United States, according to the 1990 
U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. citizens opened their arms to the first wave of refugees because they 
felt sorry for what happened in Vietnam," said Loc Nam Nguyen, a 1975 
Vietnamese immigrant and director of Catholic Charities' Immigration and 
Refugee Department in Los Angeles. "The first wave of refugees also were 
well-educated and were able to easily get jobs with the help of their 
sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
 A second large wave of refugees fled Southeast Asia in 1978, including many 
Cambodians, Laotians and ethnic Chinese from Vietnam. Many of the refugees who 
came during the past decade are former political prisoners or families who 
spent long periods in refugee camps and have little or no education. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Vietnam War, Hoang served in the Vietnamese Air Force, which fought 
alongside American troops. After the war, Hoang and others who fought against 
the Communists were sent to re-education camps. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hoang was imprisoned, his first wife left him for another man. After his 
release, he met another woman, and they later had Tam and Thien. But because 
the couple never obtained a marriage license, Hoang's second wife can't legally 
join her family in the United States, Hoang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I think about is how she can come here," Hoang said. "I'm very lonely, 
and my daughters need their mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoang and his family first lived with his sister in Massachusetts when they 
arrived. But after a few weeks, arguments erupted and the Hoangs were kicked 
out of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 With no job, money or friends, they made their way to Los Angeles, and Tam and 
Thien began attending Castelar Elementary School in Chinatown. Since then, 
Hoang's heart condition has worsened, and the girls have grown increasingly 
despondent over the separation from their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to bring my mom over here and for my dad to be healthy," Thien 
Hoang said in Vietnamese. "I worry about that a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other former war prisoners, Hoang is depressed and cannot talk about 
his past experiences without getting angry or flustered. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of refugees are suffering from post-traumatic stress and other 
emotional problems, and are not even at the point where they can find a job," 
said Rano Saing, a counselor at the Indochinese Counseling and Treatment Clinic 
in Los Angeles. "They come here and they get depressed. They feel numb and 
their minds are blank because they've been suffering for such a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Saing said that after the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in 1975, one of his 
clients was in a Cambodian hospital when troops stormed in and shot everyone 
but her. Another client who also was about to be killed by the Khmer Rouge on 
another occasion fainted and was buried alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing she remembers was waking up in the dirt with dead bodies 
around her," Saing said. "She had to dig herself out of the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you expect someone who has experienced something like this to come 
here and then go right to work or school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the refugees managed to survive and escape the war-torn conditions of 
their native countries, they are still in "survival mode," said Dore Wong, 
principal of Castelar Elementary, where about 20% of the school's 1,100 
students are Southeast Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a bleakness to their lives because they believe they have no 
future," Wong said. "They just live for the day." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, Hoang's sister arrived in Los Angeles and announced that 
she would be taking Hoang's 85-year-old mother, Le Thi Nhung, back to 
Massachusetts with her or would pay another family in Florida to take care of 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hoang's sister arrived without notice, neither he nor his daughters 
appeared to be alarmed or saddened by the grandmother's sudden departure. They 
simply helped the frail woman pack her clothes in a small suitcase and handed 
her a paper sack filled with cigarettes and a few containers of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 After sitting on a worn couch for a few minutes, Nhung got up and her 
granddaughters helped her carry out her belongings. Without speaking, she 
handed each girl a container of cookies and said goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good that this is happening," Hoang said. "We're so poor. I can't afford 
to take care of the family. At least now, she'll live in a more comfortable 
home. This is good news." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers are quite familiar with the sad plight of recent refugees, 
which can often tear families like the Hoangs apart, but they said it's 
difficult for them to reach out to everyone because many refugees are reluctant 
to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam, people rely only on their immediate families," said Mimi Ngoc Anh 
Nguyen, program director of the Indochinese Youth Center in Gardena. "Here, if 
you need help, you need to go outside your family. But Vietnamese people 
believe that's very shameful." 
</P>
<P>
 Services are also somewhat limited for Southeast Asian refugees who speak 
little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
 "The persistence of welfare dependency is due to the lack of realistic 
services to help (Southeast Asian) refugees," said Deborah Ching, executive 
director of the Chinatown Service Center. "Counseling is not readily available 
because resources are limited and language assistance is minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 While Vietnamese in Orange County and Cambodians in Long Beach tend to have 
access to a variety of counseling, parenting and job-training services because 
of their large numbers in those areas, Southeast Asians in Central Los Angeles 
and other parts of Los Angeles County have a more difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles County is home to about 114,000 Southeast Asians -- 
compared to 81,000 in Orange County -- only 33,000 Southeast Asians live in the 
city of Los Angeles, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is not like Orange County, where you get services in the same area you 
live in," said Lee Nguyen, a specialist at the Indochinese Youth Center. 
"Everything is spread out here, and people don't know how to access the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, which initially 
was enacted for two years, enabled refugees to receive a variety of financial 
assistance from the government. The act allowed refugees to receive AFDC; those 
who did not qualify for AFDC were eligible for Social Security or Refugee Cash 
Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1977 expiration date was extended, the federal government slowly 
has withdrawn its resources from refugee assistance programs and directed 
refugees to regular public aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in 1975, the government was prepared to help us," said Tri Le, 
director of the Indochinese Counseling and Treatment Clinic in Los Angeles and 
a native of Vietnam. "Someone came to my house to teach me English. And by 
1977, we were off welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 But refugees who arrived later have had more trouble seeking employment as 
public sympathy toward refugees cooled. Many refugees are also impaired because 
they are uneducated and have skills suited only for rural work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 59% of Southeast Asian refugees in California who arrived between 1985 
and 1990 have less than a high school education, compared to only 38% of the 
refugees who came between 1975 and 1979, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "To them, welfare is free money," Le said. "And they know that if they got a 
job, they probably would only make minimum wage, which wouldn't be enough to 
support their families." 
</P>
<P>
 But what's most troubling is that many refugees who arrived in the United 
States during the 1980s still depend on welfare to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 survey found that two-thirds of the Southeast Asian families that 
entered the United States in 1985 still relied, wholly or partially, on public 
assistance, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those actively seeking employment are struggling for their independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep dreaming of being able to work," Hoang said. "But my mind is confused 
and mixed up. If I don't take the money from the government, my daughters and I 
would die."  
</P>
<P>
 Hoang referred to a well-known Vietnamese proverb that best conveys his 
thoughts: "Don't give me the fish. Just teach me how to catch the fish," he 
said. "I want to have my own money because as long as I receive government 
help, I won't have my own life." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoang said he has repeatedly been turned down for jobs because his health 
is bad and he doesn't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought my kids to the freedom country because I want them to be educated 
here. I know I have to fight for the future of my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Loc Nam Nguyen said many refugees have given up on their own dreams, but 
believe in their children's prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the difficulties, many first-generation refugees believe they will 
be on welfare their whole lives," Nguyen said. "They believe this country is 
full of opportunities, but they are investing all their hopes in their 
children." Southeast Asians in L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast Asians comprise about 13% of the total 7.3 million Asian Pacific 
population in the United States, according to 1990 U.S. Census figures. Los 
Angeles County is home to more than 110,000 Southeast Asians:

 So in love, so much in love . . . ." The sound system at Dejaiz is pumping

Cross Colours logo -- yellow ("for the sun"), red ("for the blood of the 
people"), green ("for the earth") and black ("for the color of our skin"). It 
looks like an African tribal banner when he holds it up. You remember Cross 
Colours? Hooded sweats, baggy knee-length shorts and sueded denims printed with 
phrases like "Stop D Violence" and "Educate to Elevate" and "Clothing Without 
Prejudice." It was everywhere in 1992 and so were its owners, Carl Jones, who 
was responsible for the concept, and T.J. Walker, who was responsible for the 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 Autumn, 1990, was a dicey time to start a business in Los Angeles. Real estate 
was contracting. The Gulf War loomed. The whole world was watching CNN and 
holding its breath the day Jones and Walker started Cross Colours out of Jones' 
house in the Hollywood Hills. Less than a year later, the company had shipped 
$15 million worth of orders and was employing 75 workers in a 
30,000-square-foot office and warehouse in Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 Until they came along, no one had ever mass-produced African American teen 
fashion. They saw a market no one else had -- young black America and its many 
wanna-bes -- and went for it. But Carl Jones and T.J. Walker were more than 
just fashion's latest flashes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Crafted with pride in South-Central Los Angeles," their promo materials 
boasted. Jones and Walker put their own pictures on their hangtags, so, Jones 
told a Los Angeles Times reporter that year, "that people would know what we 
look like. We weren't afraid to say we're black and design for black people." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Jones and Walker were becoming culture heroes. "It happened right 
when it was cool to be black and MTV was first playing rap," says Eric Wical, a 
former merchandise manager for Merry-Go-Round, one of the nation's leading 
clothing chains. "I've never seen such a lineup of stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Arsenio Hall did his show in Cross Colours. Preteen rappers Kris Kross wore 
oversize Cross Colours backwards on MTV. Cross Colours dressed veterans like 
Stevie Wonder and newcomers like Heavy D and Mary J. Blige. At the Grammys, 
Parliament-Funkadelic looked dipped in Cross Colours. One day, Paula Abdul 
would pay Cross Colours a visit. The next day it would be Shaquille O'Neal. "It 
was like rock 'n' roll combined with the garment business," one former 
executive remembers fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Colours was the model of a progressive company. Women were in prominent, 
well-paying, decision-making positions. The work force was probably the most 
integrated in the business. Jones and Walker hired inner-city teen-agers who 
promised to wean themselves from drugs and gangs. They put on a benefit with 
KPWR, L.A.'s leading urban music station, that raised $50,000 for job training. 
They gave $200,000 in clothes to the Common Ground Foundation, a dropout 
prevention program in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 They opened "Red, Black and Green" warehouse stores in Pomona, Compton and 
Downtown. Their store next to Larry Parkers diner in Beverly Hills was Jones' 
prototype for an "urban Gap" chain. In December, 1992, Cross Colours moved 
again, this time to 150,000 square feet in the City of Commerce. By now there 
were around 300 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In an article in the California Apparel News, the bible of the West Coast 
garment business, Jones predicted that Cross Colours would book $100 million in 
women's line orders alone from Merry-Go-Round in 1992. That same month, Cross 
Colours surpassed Williwear as the largest African-American-owned business in 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Black Enterprise magazine named Threads 4 Life, Cross Colours' parent 
corporation, its "Company of the Year" and placed it 10th on the magazine's 
list of 100 top black firms, ahead of Black Entertainment Television and the 
parent company of Essence magazine. In 1994, Fortune magazine wrote that Jones 
and Walker were among "America's smartest young entrepreneurs."  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Cross Colours has all but disappeared, its manufacturing and 
warehousing operation shuttered, its vast staff a thing of the past. Creditors, 
including the Bank of New York and L.A.'s Imperial Bank, are picking over the 
bones. According to Ben Siegel, an attorney involved in the process, secured 
creditors might see a return of 50 cents or less on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failures are common in the apparel industry, but not as high profile as 
this," says Wical, "not with these extremes of success and failure." In three 
years, a company that had captured the imagination of the industry and embodied 
the best hopes of a community went from start-up to $80 million in sales to 
liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
 CARL JONES AND T.J. WALKER ARE HARD AT WORK IN a quiet design studio in the 
heart of that great swatch of garment businesses that spreads south from 
Downtown. Their nearly identical Range Rovers are parked next to each other in 
a gated lot. A set of heavy Victorian couches covered in deep, rich purple and 
red-gold velour are among the few mementos of Cross Colours' glory years. An 
old James Brown tune, "It's a New Day," is playing softly somewhere as they 
greet their visitor in a small office. Samples of their new lines hang on the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, now 40, looks preppy in a button-down broadcloth shirt, polished black 
loafers and white socks. His hair is touched with gray. He's a charmer, a 
soft-spoken, natural-born salesman. Walker is courtly in an old-fashioned 
Southern way, but guarded. He lets Jones do most of the talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is philosophical about Cross Colours' reversals. "What happened to us 
happens to a lot of fast-growing companies in this industry," he insists, 
citing the recent spectacular crash-and-burn of avant-garde New York designer 
Stephen Sprouse. He says it's unlikely he'll ever go back into production. "Now 
we're a design company. That's what we do best." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones grew up in Watts. "The riots in '65 happened literally outside my back 
door." He got his drive, he says, from his dad, an ambitious man who worked as 
a mechanic, ran an auto parts store and sold used cars. (He was murdered in a 
robbery in 1983.) The family wasn't rich, but his mom made sure he and his 
brother and sister always had food on the table, clean clothes on their backs 
and a positive attitude. "I always thought I'd be successful if I applied 
myself and stayed with it. I always wanted to own nice things." As soon as the 
family could afford to, they moved to Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says art led him to fashion. "I was always intrigued with the business 
of it, with designers who had their own companies like Calvin Klein, Ralph 
Lauren and Bob Mackie." While attending El Camino Community College in 1980, he 
took a home economics class and started making dresses. "My dad thought I was 
crazy. He thought I had become gay." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, after graduating from L.A. Trade Tech, Jones opened a small business, 
silk-screening socks, T-shirts and other garments. "I'd take my little 
briefcase and knock on doors and sell 'em samples." Surf wear, which is 
graphics-heavy, was happening at the time, so that's what he did, designing for 
Guess? (where he met his wife, Audrey), i.d. and Ocean Pacific. In 1985, as his 
business started to grow, Jones advertised for a new graphic artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was living in his car when he answered Jones' ad. They've worked 
together ever since. Slight, almost frail-looking, Walker comes from a big 
Mississippi farm family. After studying graphic design and printmaking at 
Louisiana Tech, he came to California, he says, because it was warm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Jones and Walker hooked up with a Moroccan-born, French-Canadian 
garment manufacturer named Orly Dahan. Together they created Surf Fetish, 
producing hard-core designs for the landlocked masses. After beachwear played 
out, Surf Fetish added skateboarding. After that it was biker wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl went through phases with us," Dahan recalls. "When I first knew him, he 
would dress every day like a beach bum -- white shirt and white pants. He 
brought a Bronco to carry his surfboard. Then he turned to skateboarding. He 
pierced his ear, wore Vision Street Wear -- only black -- and skulls. Then 
motorcycles started happening. He buys one Harley, two Harleys, three Harleys, 
four Harleys. He had really, really beautiful bikes. Then he buys a Range Rover 
to pull his motorcycles. He wanted to buy a Harley franchise! He rode with 
actors, producers, trendy people. He gets so involved in his character. But his 
character would change." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, says Dahan, Jones and Walker became interested in what the trade 
calls ethnic clothing, which means product for inner-city stores. That year, 
Bobby Brown's "Every Little Step" was in heavy rotation on MTV. According to 
Dahan, his wife took a look at Brown in harem pants on the video, the crotch 
down to his knees, and said: "We can do that." They formed a new label called 
Fetish Blues to make the pants and, in Dahan's words, "they blew out of the 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Several million dollars in orders came from Merry-Go-Round, a 1,400-store 
chain that became a major force in young men's clothing in the late '80s. It 
tripled in size by "spotting new trends early and jumping on them big-time," 
says Wical, and by taking over chains like Dejaiz, which had inner-city leases, 
and Chess King. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by the success of the harem pants, Jones and Walker began visiting 
stores in Los Angeles and New York, seeing what was selling. They looked at 
what filmmaker Spike Lee was doing with his Spike's Joint stores, which sell 
clothing and movie souvenirs. Walker even designed the label for Lee's line of 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Orly Dahan talks about Carl Jones, there's a shiver of awe in his voice 
-- a tone often reserved for those who have hit pay dirt. "Eventually, Jones 
understood one thing," says Dahan, "that he was an African American." Jones 
split from Dahan in October, 1990, to start his own company, taking Walker and 
others along. Dahan, now vice president of the Fetish Group, an L.A.-based 
clothing company, says there are no hard feelings now. "I thought it was a 
great idea. He saw the opportunity and did what he had to do: He lived his 
clothing. There was no blacker person in the world when he was doing Cross 
Colours than Carl Jones," he says. "There was no whiter person than him when he 
was doing surf." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Walker knew they had only a few months to design their first 
collection and manufacture samples for MAGIC, the men's apparel show at the Las 
Vegas Convention Center. The spring show, when manufacturers preview their new 
lines and stores are looking for back-to-school fashions, is the year's biggest 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have any idea what we were going to do," Walker recalls. They got a 
$175,000 bank loan but that didn't go far. "I had a Ferrari," Jones says. "I 
sold it. I had a collection of motorcycles. I sold them." Ultimately, Jones 
financed the new line with his American Express card. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few days before the show, Walker and Jones finished their first 
collection: jeans covered in graffiti-print; T-shirts silk-screened with images 
of African masks; overalls with an inch-wide tape of Kente cloth down the side 
seam. "We had panic days," Jones recalls. "We thought maybe we'd hyped 
ourselves." They called a white woman they knew who bought for Bullock's. "Was 
it too ethnic?" they worried. "Would you buy it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," she assured them. "It's really cool stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Colours came up with its slogan, "Clothing Without Prejudice" -- which 
was plastered on T-shirts, posters and hang-tags -- because, Jones explains, 
"we wanted everybody to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everybody did. Cross Colours, the only black-owned company in the 
Convention Center, took $5 million in orders -- including $1.5 million from 
Merry-Go-Round -- in four days, Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
 DEBORAH PALMER IS STRIKING -- A 6'2" BLOND aerobics instructor with the sinewy 
shoulders of someone who rowed in a college crew. She's also a men's clothing 
designer and a self-described "rap maniac" whose walls are covered with African 
masks from the collection of her mother, who is half African American. She went 
to work for Cross Colours just before the '91 MAGIC show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hype was already building," she recalls. "You felt like you were in the 
middle of a whirlwind." Titles meant almost nothing at Cross Colours -- no one 
had a job description and Jones frequently proffered and withdrew titles the 
same day -- but over the next 2 1/2 years, Palmer served as vice president of 
production and operations, then vice president of sales and merchandising. 
"There was a really great street energy. Every idea was valued -- no matter 
whether you were white, black, yellow -- because nobody knew where it was 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Colette Bailey, an African American from the West Side partial to Doc Martens 
and heavy metal, was a production assistant for Pepe jeans, but "wanted the 
opportunity to work for a black-owned company." She became manager of Cross 
Colours' children's division, which ended up among its most profitable. She was 
also at various times the division's chief designer, merchandiser and 
production manager. "The working conditions were so bad," she shakes her head 
ruefully. The roof leaked so badly "you had to wear rubber-soled shoes when it 
rained." 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, there was no floor plan, no planning of any kind. 
Departments would spring up everywhere. "We'd set up a computer terminal," says 
Palmer, "and suddenly a 15-person department would grow up around it." Jones 
didn't even have a desk. "He'd sit in the lobby and be on the phone," says 
Bailey. "You'd come in and he'd be working at your desk." Every office had its 
own radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was in their 20s and 30s. It went without saying, but everyone worked 
Saturdays because Jones and Walker always worked Saturdays. You partied with 
people from Cross Colours. You lived with people from Cross Colours. They were 
your family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a job," Palmer laughs, "it was an adventure. When you first started 
working there, you thought, 'My God, this is the most fun I've ever had in my 
life.' You were just on an adrenaline high all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Karl Kani was 23 years old and had been in Los Angeles for a year, 
selling his intricately decorated jeans out of his Hollywood apartment, 
shipping them to stores back in Brooklyn that specialized in black fashion. 
Within a month of meeting Jones, Kani was working out of Cross Colours' 
headquarters in the City of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life was soon distributing the Karl Kani line: baggy jeans in orange 
and jade, color-coordinated T-shirts and baseball caps -- everything stamped 
with "Karl Kani" on it blew out of the stores, too. At the 1992 MAGIC show, 
Jones says, Kani's line did close to $6 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, that show might have been Cross Colours at its most hyped. 
Public Enemy's "Fear of a Black Planet" boiled from the turntables in the Cross 
Colours booth. "It was so loud the golf clothes manufacturer in the next booth 
couldn't even hear to take orders," remembers Scott Sigman, a former vice 
president of production who now holds the same job for Cherokee sportswear. 
"You couldn't even get into our booth to buy anything unless you were on the 
guest list." 
</P>
<P>
 "The aisles around our booth were so packed, the fire department threatened to 
come in and force everybody to disperse," Bailey recalls, still amazed. "I 
would walk the show with T.J. and people would yell out, 'I want to work for 
you! I want to work for you!' I had never seen people act that way around 
clothes before." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first day, Cross Colours had $10 million in orders. By 
week's end, $40 million. Everything Jones and Walker touched seemed to turn 
into cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the 1,500-showroom CaliforniaMart, the largest wholesale apparel 
center in the world, voted Cross Colours its "Rising Star" award for West Coast 
menswear companies less than 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Deborah Palmer, problems had begun to surface. At the end of 
1991, she says, "Carl and T.J. just had (litigation) coming out of their ears 
from Spike Lee," who accused Walker and Cross Colours of knocking off his 
company logo. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was settled out of court. According to a representative of Lee's 
company, Jones agreed to change the name of Cross Colours' parent company from 
"Solo Joint" -- it was too similar to "Spike's Joint" -- and to refrain from 
using certain phrases identified with Lee -- "Mo' Fun" and "YA-DIG SHO-ENUFF?" 
on the labels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, what probably hurt Cross Colours most was that the settlement 
allowed only a very limited time in which to use up the 150,000 labels in its 
inventory. It destroyed some of them, but it also "massively overproduced 
garments just to use up the labels," says Palmer, who by that time was Cross 
Colours' vice president of production. As a result, retailers for the first 
time began to return the company's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The company won another "Rising Star" award in early '93. This time, however, 
Jones and Walker didn't show up for the ceremony. They later apologized, saying 
they had been unavoidably detained by negotiations with Earvin (Magic) Johnson. 
A week later, in an article in the California Apparel News, Jones announced 
that the former basketball star had purchased an interest in Cross Colours, 
would become a full-time member of the organization and promote all Cross 
Colours products, including proposed lines of Magic Johnson sportswear and 
shoes. Profits from the collaboration would fund AIDS education, prevention and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 The only trouble with Jones' announcement, says Lon Rosen, Johnson's agent, 
was that a contract had never been signed. "Earvin liked Carl Jones and wanted 
to help a black-owned company, but it just wasn't a direction he wanted to go 
in. The numbers were not what we expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers would have been better had it not been for bootlegging, which 
had long been a problem for Cross Colours. Jones estimates that as many as half 
the clothes sold with a Cross Colours label were counterfeits. His worries came 
to a head at the 1993 MAGIC. Long after publication of the convention register, 
which told buyers where sales rooms were located, Jones decided to move Cross 
Colours' booth off the main floor and into two side rooms, where, he was 
convinced, it would be easier to keep track of industrial spies. "Nobody knew 
where we were," recalls Sigman, the former vice president of production. "We 
had to switch around everyone's appointments." 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, the truck bringing the samples to Las Vegas broke down, 
so the new clothes arrived a day and a half late. When they finally did, Cross 
Colours salespeople, who had never been shown the new line, went into shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Colours' trademark reds, blacks, greens and yellows had been phased out. 
The new lines featured darker washes in predominantly earth tones. Everything 
was less baggy, less flamboyant, less . . . well, Cross Colours. "The line had 
to become more sophisticated," Jones argues, "because the customer was becoming 
more sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 The salespeople responded that they didn't know how to sell the stuff. Even 
the music in the Cross Colours booth that year had lost its edge -- acid jazz 
and A Tribe Called Quest with their soft-boy rap, "I Left My Wallet in El 
Segundo." Some say buyers left their wallets in their pockets; Jones says that 
sales exceeded $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones concedes that Cross Colours frequently had difficulty delivering orders 
on time and in full, but by now things were getting worse. "Promises were made, 
but promises were never kept," says a bitter Eric Wical. Now at Abercrombie & 
Fitch, Wical says Cross Colours delivered half of what it had promised 
Merry-Go-Round so frequently that he began to order twice as much as he needed. 
According to Wical, Cross Colours even blew its Merry-Go-Round back-to-school 
delivery, traditionally the biggest sales period of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main reasons for the slow deliveries, says a garment industry 
veteran who went to work at Cross Colours in the summer of '93, was that the 
company owed money to many of its suppliers. "We couldn't get fabrics in 
without paying cash," she says. "One sewing contractor said he was holding 
20,000 T-shirts until we paid him, and nobody even knew who he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was still telling the media as late as spring '93 that Cross Colours 
expected total sales that year of $160 million. At the same time, Cross Colours 
began selling its returns for cash to a jobber who in turn sold the clothes to 
discount outlets. Cross Colours retailers began to find themselves in 
competition with stores selling the same clothes at half the price. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1993, the Merry-Go-Round chain, which, according to the New 
York Times, accounted for about 60% of Cross Colours' revenue, was itself 
sliding into Chapter 11. Cross Colours had to start laying people off. "Every 
other Friday was Black Friday because nobody knew who was being let go," says 
Deborah Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl called a group of us into the showroom and said everything was all 
right," another ex-employee says. "Nobody had to worry about their job. That 
afternoon we were let go." When she went in to say goodby to Jones and Walker, 
they were already gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer says she and Sigman called it quits the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Former employees complain that the more people Cross Colours laid off, the 
more new cars Jones seemed to acquire. Jones' wife got a new Jaguar 
convertible. Jones himself alternated between new red and black Ferraris as he 
laid off four to 15 people a week. One former client says Jones told him that 
he'd traded Cross Colours fabric for a Rolls-Royce. "He's got two Testarossas 
and a Corniche and I'm trying to hold off contractors," Sigman remembers with 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones responds: "Buying and selling cars has always been a hobby of mine. It 
had no effect financially on Threads 4 Life. Some employees confused business 
and personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had turned company security over to Nation of Islam guards, but as 
financial pressures mounted, he decided he could no longer afford them. One of 
the guards, who had done security for Cross Colours before the Muslim group 
took over, offered to do the job for considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after that, several sources say the Nation of Islam guards showed up in 
force one day, closing the loading dock doors and sealing off the exits. 
"People were running for their cars," remembers Colette Bailey. Another witness 
says the guards accused Jones of breaching their contract and demanded $70,000 
in severance pay. Jones would not confirm the amount but says he did pay them 
in full. Cross Colours' new financial vice president, who just a week prior had 
come in at the behest of an increasingly nervous Bank of New York, resigned 
soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, Cross Colours was down to fewer than 20 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 BUILT LIKE A BOXER, A GOLD crown on a front tooth, Karl Kani seems to swagger 
even as he sits, sucking on a toothpick and answering questions in his loft on 
a busy L.A. street south of Downtown. Action swirls around him as employees 
prepare a shipment for a show in Miami. Kani stayed with Cross Colours until 
almost the bitter end. But now Kani has his trademark back, and his own 
company, Karl Kani Infinity, which claims sales of $68 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He has emerged as a competitor -- some would even say successor -- to Cross 
Colours. "You need to be out there seeing what's happening -- tellin' people 
what's happening." Kani pauses to inspect his toothpick. "People from the 
streets say Carl Jones ain't down no more." 
</P>
<P>
 And the black press seems to agree: In a feature on "ghetto chic" in the April 
issue of Quincy Jones' hip-hop magazine, Vibe, Cross Colours is never 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones shrugs off the criticism. "I like to think that I am a sensitive person. 
But does it upset me? No. It's business. I chose this business, chose my path, 
and there are circumstances that go along with it. Sometimes great, sometimes 
bad. It's part of it; especially in the apparel business, there are problems 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Like "garmentos" everywhere, he is anxious to promote his new line. Gone are 
the baggy pants, the screaming colors, the bold graphics. The colors are muted 
in earthen tones in materials like herring-bone tweed. Pullovers with a bellows 
pocket in the middle of the chest would seem to be Cross Colours' new 
signature. "The line is still urban because that's where it comes from," Jones 
says. "It's cleaner, the colors calmer, more natural. The line looks more 
rugged and it's a little more expensive than yesterday's." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says the clothes will be available soon at Macy's New York, Foot Locker 
and at Merry-Go-Round (newly emergent from bankruptcy), as well as at stores on 
the Howard University campus in Washington and Dr. J's in Harlem and Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists that he and Walker "are happier today. We're able to get in the 
studio and really design. . . . It's not like T.J. and I got lucky. We can 
still make hit records. T.J. and I are still showing, producing and 
manufacturing -- indirectly -- the Cross Colours label." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not they still own the Cross Colours trademark -- some say a 
creditor took possession of it -- is a subject of much speculation upon which 
Jones refuses to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to know what Carl Jones is really thinking. Is he just trying 
to put a happy face on a grim situation, or, as many suggest, is he so 
shellshocked that he doesn't quite understand what's going on? Maybe he's 
simply following the cardinal rule of salesmanship: Sell yourself first. Scott 
Sigman says Jones called him recently to hype Cross Colours' new line. "I 
haven't been this excited," Jones enthused, "in over a year." 
</P>
<P>
 He remains proud of what Cross Colours accomplished. "If I thought they had 
the drive and would bust their ass for the company, we gave a lot of African 
Americans an opportunity." People were able to advance faster and further at 
Cross Colours, he maintains, than they ever would at any other company. 
</P>
<P>
 In their new studio, Jones' and Walker's desks face each other, about 15 feet 
apart. Jones says he likes it that way. When they were in the City of Commerce, 
he says, it would take 10 minutes for him to walk to T.J.'s office. All of 
Cross Colours' brilliant press from the early '90s is framed and leaning 
against the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The only prominent decoration in the room is above Jones' desk -- a yellow 
autographed Andy Warhol T-shirt encased in plastic. Warhol signed it for him, 
Jones says, and he has kept it with him in every office "for good luck." It's 
impossible not to think of Warhol's remark about being famous for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is we're going forward and we're going to do it a lot more 
carefully," Jones says. But, he admits, "We're not naive. We know today you're 
hot, and tomorrow you're dead."

CRENSHAW TAKES GAME SKY HIGH; GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM WILL FLY TO AFRICA TO 
REPRESENT THE U.S. IN 4-COUNTRY TOUR

 Crenshaw High girls' basketball team reached new heights when they won their 
second consecutive City Section 4-A Division title. But the Cougars didn't 
realize their victory would carry them another 10,000 feet in the air and 
halfway around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, along with two-time City 3-A boys' champion Wilmington Banning, 
have been chosen to represent the United States in the Africa Challenge Tour. 
They depart July 27 on a monthlong trip that begins in Paris and continues 
through four countries in Western Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a once-in-a-lifetime trip," Crenshaw sophomore center Naila Mosely said. 
"Most people don't get a chance to travel to another country. I've only been to 
Las Vegas and cities in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Banning and Crenshaw will participate in boys' and girls' tournaments in 
Benin, Togo, the Central African Republic and Gabon. Co-Coach Greg Cobbs will 
be responsible for the seven Cougar girls making the trip and Banning Coach 
Marc Paez will escort the seven Pilot boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a lot of work and a burden to a certain degree," Cobbs said. "But 
how many people have you talked to have ever been to Paris?" 
</P>
<P>
 Making the trip for the Cougars are: Mosely, All-City Section senior guard 
Kristi Lattin, junior point guard Devin King, senior forward Bridget Jemison, 
senior guard Sommer Tillet, junior forward Quiana Knox and sophomore forward 
Kisha Shephard.  
</P>
<P>
 "When my coaches told me, I said 'For real?' I was shocked," Lattin said. "I 
think the girls deserve it because we won City two years in a row. We get to 
learn about other people and a new culture firsthand, and not from a book." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the seven girls making the trip have ever traveled outside the United 
States and only three players have ever flown. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I've never been on a plane before," Knox said. "I'm kind of scared. I'm 
also worried about getting homesick if we're gone too long. In my environment, 
I'm used to seeing the same people every day. But I'll make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jemison, the team's most experienced traveler, said she was apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about the plane shaking, probably because I watch too much TV," 
Jemison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The African tour is sponsored by the French National Basketball Federation, 
which each year selects European teams to compete and help promote basketball 
in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said she was told by a tournament official 
that this is the first time teams from the United States have been asked to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The invitation was presented to the school district as an all-expense-paid 
trip for two teams of seven players each and a coach to travel to Africa," she 
said. "The Senior High Division selected Banning and Crenshaw based on their 
double victories in City championship games. It was up to the individual 
schools to decide whether they sent their boys' or girls' teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said the details of the trip have been sketchy so far because the 
information she has received has been written in French. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had to have everything translated into English because my French isn't 
very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the trip is a month away, some Cougars have already thought about 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking my whole wardrobe," Knox said. "I think it's going to be hot so 
I'll need a visor and lots of suntan lotion." 
</P>
<P>
 The players' parents, however, have more pressing things to worry about. For 
most, this will be the first time their children have been away from home for 
more than a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tillet's mother, Delsie: "All the mothers are concerned because they are 
girls and they're not as emotionally and physically as tough as the boys. As a 
mother you do research and study about the countries so you can prepare your 
child for anything they may encounter." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lattin's mother, Gloria: "My husband has talked to her about the trip. He 
explained to her how she should carry herself when she is away from home and if 
something were to happen, who to call. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I feel helpless because if something happens, I'm not there to help her," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their inhibitions, the players and their parents agree it's a 
once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great opportunity and a great learning experience," Paez said.

PLAYING HARDBALL; THE ALL-WOMAN COLORADO SILVER BULLETS BASEBALL TEAM IS 
CHALLENGING THE MEN AT THEIR OWN GAME. FOR THE BULLETS, WIN OR LOSE, IT'S A 
DREAM COME TRUE. FOR THE MEN, IT'S WIN OR ELSE. 
</P>

<P>
By Pat Jordan, Pat Jordan is a former minor league pitcher who was a teammate 
of Phil Niekro in McCook, Neb., in 1959. His last story for the magazine was a 
profile of Brian Boitano. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a peaceful Mother's Day in Ft. Mill, South Carolina -- warm, sunlit, 
with no hint of dread. A good day to play two, as Ernie Banks used to say. 
Inside Knights Castle, a minor league stadium, the air is filled with the 
lulling sounds of baseball. The crack of a bat against a ball. The soft crunch 
of spikes digging into red clay. The slap of a fist into leather. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado Silver Bullets, preparing for their first formal game, are being 
watched over lovingly by family members and supporters. Not all of their fans 
are here, of course. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Janet Reno, for instance, 
couldn't make it, so they sent letters of encouragement. Geena Davis, the 
actress, sent a letter, too. She exhorted the Bullets to "kick the asses" of 
their competition today. She signed her name, followed by her uniform number, 
8, which she wore as a member of the Rockford Peaches in "A League of Their 
Own." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets also are being watched over by their sponsors, owners, manager, 
coaches, publicist and assorted other staffers, all mingling with 100 or so 
members of the sports media. Whenever possible, someone from the Bullets' 
entourage leads a journalist over to one of the Bullets for an interview. In 
fact, the area around the home-team dugout and behind the home plate 
batting-practice cage is dotted with tight little groups of reporters recording 
the players' every word, covering this practice as if it were Game 7 of the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets look like professional ballplayers in their immaculate gray 
uniforms with bright red-and-blue script across their chests. The hitters hitch 
up their pants, toss grass into the wind and grunt loudly on each swing. The 
infielders, faces down, charge ground balls, snapping them up on the short hop. 
Outfielders backpedal lazily, shade their eyes with their gloves and swipe fly 
balls out of the sky. The pitchers throw in the bullpen with compact overhand 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is something stylized about the Bullets. At the plate, the 
pitches are slapped at, not ripped. The fielding is a tick slow, as if the 
players were calculating each move rather than reacting -- throwing and 
catching as if the game itself, not other players, would be their main 
adversary. Which may be why they are so quick to congratulate one another: 
"Good catch, Shae!" "Thanks, Kim!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets are members of the first and only women's professional 
baseball team in decades. Not since the All-American Girls Baseball League of 
the '40s and '50s have women had the chance to play pro hardball. Never before 
have they had a chance to play it against men. This season the Bullets will 
make history, playing about 50 exhibition games against men's college, amateur, 
semipro and minor league teams. Today, in this borrowed stadium, they will 
challenge the All Stars of the independent Double-A Northern League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets are owned by Whittle Sports Properties, a division of Whittle 
Communications in Knoxville, Tenn., and they are sponsored by the Coors Brewing 
Co. to the tune of about $2.5 million this season, $20,000 each for five 
months' work, more than the average minor leaguer gets. They will be playing 
against men because both Whittle and Coors believe that they can reap a profit 
and, in Coors' case, product recognition through the novelty of a baseball 
battle of the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the women practice, Phil Niekro, former big league knuckleballer and now 
the Bullets' manager, leans against a bat and explains all of this and more to 
a clutch of reporters. Women have obvious disadvantages when competing against 
men in baseball, Niekro admits, some of which are inherent in the physiology 
and some of which are a holdover from fast-pitch softball, the game most of 
them were playing just a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the hitters and that awkward slapping motion. In fast-pitch softball, 
the slap is desirable -- the idea is that the pitch's considerable speed will 
generate power. In baseball, hitters use their own strength to drive the ball. 
Then there is the ball itself. The women are used to gripping a big softball 
with four fingers, rather than the two fingers used to grip a baseball. They 
are used to swinging lightweight aluminum bats rather than the heavier wooden 
bats used in baseball. They are used to tracking a big ball across a small 
field, not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Niekro adds, in some ways the women have surprised him. They are 
excellent infielders, with the arm strength to nail a runner at first from deep 
third. The pitchers are his biggest surprise. With technically perfect motions, 
they can set up hitters and deliver decent curveballs and sliders, excellent 
change-ups and good fastballs in the 78-m.p.h. range (Tom Glavine, the Atlanta 
Braves' Cy Young Award pitcher, for years threw chiefly in the low 80s range). 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Niekro says, even the women's physical disadvantages turned out to 
be strengths. Because they can't fire a ball on a line from center field to 
home, they have to field as most baseball players are taught but seldom do -- 
throwing to the cutoff man behind second base, who then relays the ball home. 
They have to execute the mechanics of the game, seeing it as a chessboard 
requiring proper moves, rather than a strength game. And women are easier to 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You show them something and their eyes get big," says Niekro. " 'Teach me!' 
they say, and they do it right every time. You can't show 'em enough. They have 
no bad habits, because everything is new to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost no bad habits. Niekro runs a tight ship; his feeling is that his 
players must act like the pros -- which is to say, men -- or lose their 
opponents' respect. He has spent a lot of time trying to instill in them an 
appropriate sense of cool. Niekro was annoyed in spring training when a player 
hit her first triple, steamed into third base, leaped into the air and hugged 
the third base coach. He called time and went out to tell her there's no 
hugging in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 And no apologizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," a fielder once told Niekro after she made an error. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you make it on purpose?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Then what are you apologizing for?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 A female reporter needles Niekro until he nearly loses his own cool. She 
gestures to where the women are warming up. Isn't it all just a stunt, she 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro bristles. "The game is the game," he replies. "I wouldn't be here if 
this was a sideshow. If they play the game the way it's supposed to be played, 
you have to take them seriously." (As he talks, an errant baseball rolls toward 
the reporters. A man in the group picks it up and tosses it, limp-wristed, to a 
Bullets pitcher. She catches it and laughs. "Gee," she says, "You throw just 
like a guy.") 
</P>
<P>
 The reporters are still crowding around Niekro and the Bullets when manager Ed 
Nottle of the Northern League All Stars steps into the visiting team's dugout. 
He is 57, short, with a paunch. His skin is dark and leathery, his face a map 
of every 14-hour bus ride he's endured, every case of beer he's drunk during 
his one season in the majors and 37 years on baseball's outer margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Nottle puts a foot on the top dugout step. A smile spreads across his 
features. He growls out a crude little song of his own creation: "The girls in 
Thunder Bay," it begins, "are the easiest lay." Behind him, his players shuffle 
into the dugout. They move stiffly, like a defeated army in retreat. The All 
Stars are mostly veterans, some ex-big leaguers, men in their 30s, muscular and 
fat, black and white, in mismatched uniforms, with tattooed biceps and shaved 
heads and little gold rings in their ears. They all stand and stare at the 
women in uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Check out the third baseman," says one. "Sweeeet. I never thought I'd want to 
kiss a third baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 The other players smile like Nottle -- threatening, lascivious smiles -- the 
smiles of a band of pirates who have stumbled across a land of unprotected 
maidens. They are all thinking the same thing, about doing what it is in the 
nature of pirates to do: rape, pillage and burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gonna put a hurtin' on these broads." 
</P>
<P>
 DURING THIS PAST WINTER, THE BULLETS HELD 13 TRYOUTS IN 11 CITIES. Candidates 
paid their own way to these tryouts, some of them held at 6 a.m., the only time 
the Bullets could rent a diamond. Almost 1,300 women showed up, 55 of whom were 
invited to the Bullets' spring training camp in Orlando, Fla. Forty-nine showed 
up, and after eight weeks, the team was trimmed to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are between the ages of 22 and 30. Each is unmarried; each gave up a 
job or school to join the team. All of them have had a love affair with 
baseball, or sports in general, since they were children. Just like boys -- and 
with them -- they played in Little League, Pony League and on co-ed high school 
teams. Unlike the boys, however, virtually every one was forced to quit 
baseball in her teens, trading it in for softball or turning to some other 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Anne Ketcham, 24, P, Birmingham, Ala., fell for baseball when she was 7 
years old. "I was watching the '77 World Series on a little black-and-white TV 
in my room," she says. "Reggie Jackson hit three home runs." Ketcham was the 
only girl on her hometown Little League team. She made the All Stars at 10 and 
dreamed of becoming a major leaguer. When she turned 12, the boys began to get 
bigger and stronger. "I knew (then) I couldn't be a big leaguer. Besides, I was 
lonely being the only girl, even though the guys respected me." She continued 
playing baseball in high school ("My coach was supportive," she says) and 
fashioned a 12-5-6 record as a starting pitcher on an otherwise all-male team. 
After she graduated, she turned to softball, earning a scholarship to Oklahoma 
State University. Playing with women, she says, was "hard for me. They were too 
emotional. The guys pushed themselves more. They were disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
 Shae Sloan, 22, P, Splendora, Tex., was so successful playing Dixie League, 
Pony League and high school baseball that Red Murf, the legendary baseball 
scout, invited her to a minor league tryout. He told her he wanted to be the 
first to have a female try out for a pro team. The 300 boys there were 
"standoffish at first," then Sloan made a nice fielding play she considered 
easy. Sloan never expected to be signed. "I was honored," she says, "but I 
didn't think anything would come of it." She, too, turned to softball for a 
college scholarship, although she didn't like it: "It was too close, too 
fast-paced. Baseball is slower, smoother, a strength game. My roots are in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 On and on these stories go. Stacy Sunny, 28, C, Huntington Beach, a Little 
League all-star, hit .422 in Pony League play in 1980. Missy Coombes, 25, P, 
Arcadia, was a Little League star who pitched ahead of her contemporary, Tim 
Worrell, now with the San Diego Padres. She quit at 14, with a Pony League 11-1 
record, because her high school coach made it known he wouldn't allow her on 
his team. Charlotte Wiley, 25, DH, Teaneck, N.J., came from a family of eight 
older brothers. she was her team's MVP in the Boys' Bronco World Series in 1982 
and later her high school team's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to play baseball was never easy for these women. "When I was the first 
girl in Little League," says Gina Satriano, 28, P, Malibu, "we got threatening 
calls. They burned a tree on our lawn. Guys quit the team. We filed lawsuits." 
Satriano's dad, Tom, played 10 years in the majors. Julie Croteau, 23, 1B, 
Manassas, Va., filed a lawsuit against her high school when she was refused a 
tryout for the team. "He (the coach) told me I was a bad child." Croteau 
eventually became the first woman ever to play on an NCAA Division III men's 
team, at St. Mary's College in Maryland. Michele McAnany, 30, 2B, Culver City, 
another player whose dad was a big leaguer, gave up baseball for softball after 
sustaining a serious concussion in a Little League game when she was 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Until they heard about the Bullets, Ketcham, Sloan, Sunny and virtually every 
other woman on the squad had long ago put baseball out of their minds. Ketcham, 
now a graduate student, hadn't played hardball in six years. "As for baseball," 
she says, "I thought maybe the next generation, my daughter." Sloan, who just 
graduated from the University of Nebraska, assumed her softball career would 
end when she got her diploma. Others had exchanged sports for careers -- 
Satriano was a deputy district attorney in Compton; Sunny was the production 
supervisor on "Rescue 911"; Coombes and McAnany were teachers. When they heard 
about the Bullets, though, they didn't think twice about starting over. "We 
dropped our lives to play baseball," McAnany says, "because we love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the opportunities Coors and Whittle handed the women, none was more 
surprising than the chance to compete against men. "I never thought they'd let 
us do it," says Kim Braatz, 24, RF, Albuquerque, N.M. For a few of the women, 
it was the main reason to join the team. "If we weren't playing against men, I 
wouldn't have tried out," says Sunny. "I want to show we can compete against 
them." But most of the women see the battle of the sexes in milder terms. "I 
like being a pioneer in a male bastion," says Satriano, "but that's not my 
driving force. I love baseball." Says Elizabeth Burnham, 23, C, Newbury, Vt.: 
"It's neat (to play against men). But I'm not out to prove anything. I measure 
myself against the game, not men." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Bullets are not afraid of playing baseball against men but are 
worried about working for them. They wonder if the men at Coors and Whittle are 
serious about women's baseball. "I'm skeptical," says Keri Kropke, 22, OF, 
Whittier, "but I can still go back to law school. Baseball will look good on my 
resume." Wiley, the team's only African American (fewer than 20 black women 
tried out for the team), sums up her teammates' fears: "I worry this whole 
thing is bogus. That they just want to make money off us. The press treats us 
as a joke. They ask if we like boys. Do they ask Barry Bonds if he likes his 
third baseman?" 
</P>
<P>
 All the Bullets agree that it is Niekro's dedication that reassures them. He 
is the consummate Bullets cheerleader. "What makes men so special on this earth 
that we can't give women the opportunity to do the same things we do?" he asks 
with some irritation. "I want to see a woman in the minor leagues some day. I 
want to see little girls go to sporting goods stores to buy bats and gloves 
autographed by the Silver Bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro may seem an odd man to harbor such egalitarian feelings. He is 55, with 
thinning gray hair, saddlebags under his pale eyes. He grew to manhood in an 
era when most women were expected to stay at home. Niekro, points out one of 
his players, doesn't even have daughters. But he does appreciate a solid 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro pitched in the major leagues for 23 years, mostly with the Atlanta 
Braves. He won 318 games, the 14th-winningest pitcher in baseball history. Yet 
it took six seasons in the minor leagues before he made the majors. And he did 
it with a pitch -- the erratic, uncontrollable knuckleball -- that almost 
everyone advised him to abandon. No starting pitcher before Niekro had ever 
been as successful by relying solely on a knuckleball. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even Niekro the pioneer can't help being a tad paternalistic. "When I 
close my eyes," sighs Wiley, "Phil sounds just like my daddy." "He carries our 
bags," says Sunny. "He asks us if the food is OK, did we get enough sleep, do 
we need anything?" "Phil and Joe (Joe Niekro, Phil's brother, who won 221 
big-league games, is the Bullets' pitching coach) are like father figures," 
says Ketcham. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at a banquet with Phil and Joe," says Sloan. "Phil told those people 
that he believed in us. Then Joe said this was the most fun he ever had in 
baseball, except for the every fifth day that he pitched." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time Joe says that, it catches my heart," says Bridget Venturi, 27, P, 
Highland Park, Ill. "They're just like fathers to me." She stops herself when 
she realizes the significance of what she's said. "You know," she shakes her 
head, "I'd never say that about a woman coach, that she was like a mother to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BULLETS' LAST WARM-UP GAME before their Mother's Day season opener was 
played against the semipro Knoxville Braves at Bill Meyer Stadium, an old 
ballpark with gaudy blue wooden bleachers, a corrugated tin roof behind home 
plate and a red-brick factory building with broken windows beyond the 
left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 fans, all rooting for the Bullets, showed up for the game. 
There were so many cars backed up to get into the park that one Whittle 
employee said it looked like "Field of Dreams." Before the game, the Braves, 
men between the ages of 30 and 45, with bodies and talents as worn as Bill 
Meyer Stadium, were generous in their comments about the women they would be 
playing. Pitcher Larry Minor said, "I'm addicted to this game. If anyone has 
the same attitude, I'm all for them." Shortstop Matt Bailey said: "I think this 
is great. I just don't want to be the first guy to strike out." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's owner, Dr. Paul Rivard, a heavy-bellied surgeon, stood smiling in 
the dugout. "I was told," he said, "if we lose, I'd better stay on I-40 after 
the game and not get off." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivard may still be on I-40. His Braves lost to the Bullets, 5-3. The Bullets 
played an almost flawless game in the field, making only one error. Their 
pitchers, Ketcham, Coombes and Lisa Martinez, held the Braves to only eight 
hits in seven innings. But the Bullets' batting was their weakest link. They 
managed only a single hit but made it count. 
</P>
<P>
 It came in the second inning. Minor lost control. He walked three batters and 
hit one, Kropke, with a hanging curveball. Minor was so distraught that he ran 
off the mound as if he was going to enfold her in a comforting embrace. She 
waved him off and jogged to first. Sunny, the Bullets' catcher, then lined a 
triple down the right-field line to empty the bases. When Sunny scored on an 
error, the Bullets had posted a five-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, Sunny had already showed herself to be one of the Bullets' 
brightest hopes. That night she had a career game, catching a difficult foul 
pop-up, pouncing on a swinging bunt and throwing the runner out at first, and 
blocking the plate to tag another runner sliding home. After the game, she told 
a TV reporter: "I feel real good about the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivard didn't share her attitude. When he and his players lined up to shake 
hands with each of the Bullets, his face was beet-red with rage. "How the 
hell," he snapped, "could you predict our pitcher would walk four batters in 
one inning?" 
</P>
<P>
 IN KNOXVILLE, THE BULLETS WERE entertained by their owners and sponsors at a 
pizza party held in the grassy outdoor courtyard of Whittle's faux Williamsburg 
offices. The players sat at picnic tables, eating pizza, drinking Coors Light 
and signing Silver Bullets T-shirts and caps for several dozen Whittle 
employees who milled about curiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro was there; so was Bob Hope -- not the comedian but the president of 
Whittle Special Events -- the man who conceived the Bullets. Genial, with a 
soft Southern drawl, Hope was a vice president of the Atlanta Braves in the 
'70s and was named Promoter of the Decade by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
In 1985, he wanted to field a co-ed Class A minor league team of men and women. 
He applied for a franchise but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball was incensed by the whole idea then," says Hope, smiling. "But I 
remembered what Hank Aaron once said: 'Somewhere, there's a woman who can play 
second base in the big leagues.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hope, who has two daughters, 18 and 22, whom he is so enamored of that he 
plastered the walls of his office with their photographs, put his idea on hold, 
waiting for baseball to catch up to his genius. Then, a year ago, Leo Kiely, 
president and CEO of Coors, contacted Whittle and asked them to come up with a 
mainstream sport to help market Coors beers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leo wanted something that changed the way sports looks at itself,"says Hope. 
"I gave him six ideas, among them a women's baseball team, and he loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiely was enthralled with Hope's idea. "We're gonna win the 
marketing-concept-of-the-year award!" he told Hope, who countered: "Hell, we're 
gonna win the Nobel Prize for bringing the world closer together!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hope and Niekro agree that the current Bullets are probably not the best women 
baseball players in the country. They are the best available to them now -- the 
ones willing to take a chance in their lives. Some of the best women players 
are under 21, so they can't legally play for the beer-sponsored Bullets, and 
many are preparing for the '96 Olympics and won't be available until after that 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women we have are pioneers," says Hope. "They are taking a chance in the 
wilderness -- building a fort others can come to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope says they will survive only if they are not continually embarrassed by 
men's teams and, of course, if they help Coors and Whittle turn a profit. "Of 
course we plan on making money off of this," says Hope. "As does Coors. This is 
the first team created to market a concept." 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains to be seen just how well Whittle and Coors actually get that 
concept. Their promotional efforts have included bar trips, where the team can 
sign autographs and, by osmosis, plug Coors beers. For one of them, the Bullets 
boarded the team bus with family members, coaches and a Japanese film crew and 
took a 40-minute ride over back roads to the Good Times Lake Club in rural 
South Carolina. Several Harleys were parked in front -- "Not a good sign," 
someone told Niekro. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the club was dark-paneled, low ceilinged and filled with slot 
machines. Seated at the bar were a handful of patrons wearing long mountain-man 
beards and lots of keys dangling from their belt loops. A barmaid dressed in a 
black bustier, see-through harem pants and gold lame panties had a butterfly 
tattoo over her breast. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera crew immediately turned on their strobe lights and began filming 
the scene. Just as quickly, the bar's patrons raised their hands to shield 
their faces. Niekro was livid. He stormed outside. "I felt like running my arm 
down the bar to knock over every drink," he said later. Instead, he rounded up 
his players and left. 
</P>
<P>
 The following morning, he was still furious. "That's not the image I want to 
project with my players," he seethed and threatened to quit if Coors made them 
go to one more bar. Coors conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I have stayed there if I was with a men's team?" Niekro considered the 
question. "Hell, yes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 ON MOTHER'S DAY, AS THE first pitch gets closer and closer, Niekro begins to 
hedge his bets. The All Stars will be tough, he says. He has already told some 
reporters that he thinks the team is full of ringers: "Those guys didn't even 
play in the Northern League last year, so how could they be All Stars?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the men first arrived at the stadium, they discovered that the home 
locker room was off limits and that the women had taken control of the 
visitors' digs. They wandered around until they found a hand-printed sign: 
"Northern League All Star Locker." Underneath, a more permanent sign read 
"Men's Lounge." It was the concessionaire's bathroom. Manager Nottle, who is at 
least as paternalistic about his players as Niekro, was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "One toilet! One shower!" he screamed, hurling obscenities. "I hate this whole 
situation. Every time they add another indignity, I want you to get another 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the media finally pick out a few All Stars to interview, they try to 
be polite. Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd, 35, for instance, who once played for the Red 
Sox, is a skinny black man with a goatee and lots of jewelry. "I got no beef 
they get special accommodations," Boyd tells a reporter, referring to the fact 
that the Bullets are staying in a chichi hotel while the Stars are staying at a 
Days Inn motel. "Let the girls sleep good and eat good. We're men, we don't 
care if we eat. They gonna find out . . . . We eat baseball. If we lose? If we 
lose, we put on a dress and leave town in disguise." Back in the dugout, when 
the teams take the field, Boyd is suddenly less polite. "We gotta kill these 
bitches," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if one of them gets hit in the chest?" asks one of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell 'em not to rub it," says Mike Curtis, 32, one of the team's pitchers. 
"Let me." 
</P>
<P>
 The All Stars bat first against the Bullets' Ketcham, scoring three runs in 
the top of the first inning. When the Bullets' left fielder catches a long fly 
ball to retire the Stars, one of the men says, "Nice catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Nottle turns on him, furious. "That was a routine play," he snarls. "That's 
what I hate about playing women. They belong in the kitchen. That's what we 
have kitchens for." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd warms up on the mound with a big, long-limbed delivery. Then he glares 
down at the Bullets' first batter, Michele McAnany. She rips his first fastball 
on a line over second base. The Stars' second baseman leaps, but the ball tips 
off his glove for a single. In the dugout, Nottle curses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyd retires the side after that hit. When he returns to the dugout, he is 
smiling. "My stuff's so sore," he says ruefully, "I can't get a woman out. I'm 
gonna be on TV. They gonna beam it to all the planets. Show a woman ripping my 
stuff on Venus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars score two quick runs in the second; then it's Leon (Bull) Durham's 
turn to bat. Durham is 37 and overweight. He lumbers toward the plate like a 
Stone Age savage, dragging his bat in the dirt behind him. He mutters, "I gotta 
do what I gotta do." He hits a Ketcham fastball on a rising line toward right 
field and stands at the plate to watch it. The ball keeps rising, over the 
350-foot right-field fence and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans are shocked into silence. Before the inning is over, the Stars have 
scored five more runs and Nottle has begun to relax. He tells his team to let 
up on the Bullets. "You guys can make an out now and then," he says. "So we can 
go drink some beer." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Stars can only do what is in their nature to do. Durham hits another 
towering home run. Then ex-big leaguer Carl Nichols follows suit. The Bullets 
begin to fall apart in the field. They make six errors by the end of the game, 
a 19-0 rout. By then, most of the 8,100 fans have already left, and Nottle 
stands at the top of his dugout. "You wanna play with the boys," he announces 
in the general direction of the Bullets, "you gonna play with the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have to shake hands with them now, Ed?" asks one of the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or do we play real baseball, you mean?" says Nottle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Stars do want to shake the Bullets' hands. The women, however, are 
across the field, signing autographs. The Stars stand around their dugout, 
looking lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we supposed to do, Ed?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go drink beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Stars follow Nottle back to the locker room, and the Bullets 
ignore the few who remain. It's not payback -- the women have been well out of 
earshot of the men's vituperation; it's just that for the Bullets right now, 
shaking hands with the All Stars is beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they used us," says one of the men, plaintively. "Now they don't 
need us." 
</P>
<P>
 Unbelievably, on the other side of the field, most of the Bullets are smiling, 
happy, as if this wonderful occasion couldn't be marred merely by the terrible 
result of the game. A few of them, however, are ashen-faced. Catcher Sunny and 
pitcher Ketcham look stunned. Niekro looks stunned, too. As he is being 
interviewed, Niekro raises his hand to make a point, but it is shaking so badly 
that he puts it back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the men's lounge, the Stars' are, for once, silent. No one is 
celebrating. The players undress and sip from cans of beer. They look stunned, 
too, and ashamed, as if they have just been a party to something that has left 
them feeling dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 THE NIGHT BEFORE THE Bullets-All Stars blowout, Michele McAnany's dad, Jim, 
had been sitting at the outdoor bar of the Park Hotel, watching the players 
celebrate the upcoming opener. When one young woman walked past him, he wished 
her good luck. "Thanks," she replied. A man nearby added: "And don't get hurt." 
The player glared back. "What do you mean by that?" "I mean," he shrugged, 
"don't get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't understand what's happening here," McAnany's dad said, after the 
player had walked on. "Those guys, the All Stars are gonna be out for blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McAnany is a round, sweet-natured man in his late 50s. It's hard to 
picture him as a slim outfielder for the White Sox 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I wanted Michy to play baseball," McAnany says. "I told her if 
she decided to do this and it gets difficult, she can't quit. You know, Michy's 
as good an infielder as I've ever seen in my life. But from a physical 
standpoint, I don't think she can play against men." 
</P>
<P>
 One month and 10 games later, the Silver Bullets still haven't done much to 
prove Jim McAnany wrong. Except for one win against the Richfield Rockets in 
St. Paul, they have lost every game they've played. But they have also heeded 
McAnany's injunction to his daughter: No one is quitting, and that includes 
Coors and Whittle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased," said Bob Hope in early June, not a hint of 
condescension in his voice. "The Bullets have been very competitive over the 
last two games." Against the Men of the Mountain in Asheville, N.C., and Sioux 
Falls' Circus Sports Bar, the Bullets lost in low-scoring games by one run 
only. "The girls are down, but they don't realize how much they've improved," 
Hope added. "Attendance is averaging 5,000 a game, and we expect Coors to pick 
up its option for next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But how about that 19-0 score? "We have to find the women's level of 
competition," Hope says evenly. And what he means is this: A few days after 
Mother's Day, the Colorado Silver Bullets made a quiet announcement. Five games 
would be removed from the 1994 calendar -- those scheduled against the Northern 
League All Stars.

NOTEBOOK; RAMIREZ GETS BACK ON TRACK AT EAST L.A. COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The track and cross-country programs have returned to East Los Angeles 
College. And so has Louis Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who coached at East L.A. from 1988 to 1990 and competed for the 
Huskies in 1977-78, was named to head the recently reinstated programs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, 38, said ties to the community college and the school's facilities 
influenced his decision to leave Trade Tech, where he has coached the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have remained at Trade Tech," Ramirez said. "I was very established 
there, but I was swayed being . . . (an) East L.A. alumnus." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams coached by Ramirez have won the past seven Southern California Athletic 
Conference women's cross-country titles. Ramirez led the East L.A. women to 
three consecutive SCAC titles before moving to Trade Tech, where the men's team 
won their third conference track title in four years this year and the women 
have won two titles under Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez hasn't been fazed by a late start on recruiting at East L.A., which 
has not fielded cross-country or track teams since 1991. When he took over in 
1988 the programs had been suspended for two years because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be easier this time because I've established a wider region to 
draw from," Ramirez said. "I'm very well-known around East L.A., but can also 
draw from City schools like Dorsey and Manual Arts. There has been a void at 
East L.A., but there are a lot of kids already there that want to come and 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Rodriguez has resigned as football coach at Lincoln High to become an 
assistant at Garfield High, where he will be the offensive coordinator under 
John Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez opted for the move after he was offered a teaching position in the 
physical education department. The opening was created as part of Garfield's 
expansion from a three- to a four-year school this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was 63-32-1 in 10 years at Lincoln after taking over a program that 
had won only three games in the two previous seasons. Rodriguez also led 
Lincoln to the City 3-A championship game and seven playoff berths, including 
three league titles. 
</P>
<P>
 No replacement for Rodriguez has been named. 
</P>

<P>
 Ruth Wysocki, a 1984 U.S. Olympian in the 800 and 1,500 meters, will compete 
in Union Bank's Heart of the City 5K run Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysocki, 37, was one of 17 athletes and coaches who risked a lifetime 
suspension by defying an international ban by participating in three 
unsanctioned meets in South Africa in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysocki, who stunned favored Mary Decker to win the 1,500 in the 1984 U.S. 
Olympic Trials, was given a four-year suspension by the Athletics Congress, the 
U.S. governing body of track and field, but in 1991 became the first athlete to 
win reinstatement after three years of appeals and hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysocki will face a field that includes Sylvia Mosqueda, the 1988 NCAA 
champion at 10,000 meters for Cal State L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 The 3.1-mile race begins at 7 p.m. at the Union Bank Plaza and winds through 
Downtown.

CITY FORCE TEAM HELPS GIRLS REACH HIGHER IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Chase was one of about 25 spectators watching a girls basketball game at 
Crenshaw High during the Watts Summer Games. He was the only fan critiquing the 
play during a one-sided game between Crenshaw and Compton Centennial. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that girl was guarding a telephone poll, she would need weakside help," 
Chase said. "Where is the defense on that play?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although he stopped coaching high school basketball in 1992, the former 
Washington High coach is still working with City Section players. He is the 
founder, organizer, financier and coach of City Force, a traveling Amateur 
Athletic Union girls' basketball team in its second year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with girls' basketball players from the City (Section) is that 
they don't get scholarships," said Chase, who led Washington to four 
consecutive City 4-A titles between 1988 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception by college coaches is that City players are fast and athletic 
but do not have the fundamental skills to play college ball." 
</P>
<P>
 City Force is made up of 14- to 16-year-old players from the City Section. 
Among the 12 players are Kanisha Best of Washington, Florastine Hillis of 
Fremont, Kristi Lattin of Crenshaw, Ruby Maciel of South Gate, Naila Moseley of 
Crenshaw and Aisha Savage of Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase believes the extra playing time with an all-star team will increase the 
success rate of City players getting scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to put the girls in a situation where they can get as much 
exposure as possible," said Chase, adding that these players need to learn 
something more than an up-tempo style. "Most teams in the City play a 
run-and-gun style offense. Those teams who are not fast enough play 
walk-and-gun. I'm trying to teach team concepts and defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The top boys' basketball players often receive all-expense-paid trips to 
national camps sponsored by major shoe companies, but City Force members must 
organize candy sales, raffles and other fund-raisers to pay for their trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase estimates the traveling expenses at about $1,500 a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking quite a bit of effort to raise money for this team," said Chase, 
who volunteers his time. "But if at least one player gets a scholarship, it 
will be worth it."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: STILL NO ROOM FOR GRATEFUL 
DEAD EVEN IN RELAXED-FIT 'WOODSTOCK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "It's been a long time coming . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Crosby, Stills & Nash 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years, to be exact. The opening number in "Woodstock," the 
documentary of the 1969 music festival that forever marked a generation, is 
unfurling on the big screen once again. And this time, there is even more peace 
and love to go around. Forty minutes of footage, including some of Janis Joplin 
and Jimi Hendrix, has been added to the already three-hours-plus length of the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which also features remixed sound, opens Wednesday at just four 
theaters (Mann's Chinese in Hollywood, South Coast Plaza in Orange County and 
two theaters in New York), seven weeks before a much-ballyhooed anniversary 
concert will be held near the original concert site. 
</P>
<P>
 The added footage will include Joplin singing "Work Me, Lord"; more of 
Hendrix, including "Voodoo Chile"; two Jefferson Airplane songs, "Try" and 
"Uncle Sam's Blues" and Canned Heat performing "Change Is Gonna Come."  
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the new footage, says original director Michael Wadleigh, who 
is overseeing the expanded version, is Hendrix's "Voodoo Chile." "It's about 
death -- what happened to him, the Vietnam War. It was a telling moment."  
</P>
<P>
 Viewers will hear sound supervisor L.A. (Larry) Johnson's restored sound, 
where the original eight-track recording was put in a sonic solution. "The 
digital domain regenerates the tapes to a higher level that removes all of the 
hisses and distortion that pops up after 25 years," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not the only addition. In 1994, Wadleigh, instead of protesting the 
Vietnam War or the Establishment, is tweaking distributor Warner Bros. and the 
MPAA, which rated both versions of the film R, which Wadleigh thinks is too 
harsh. (The film got the label for language, nudity and drug references.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the new version, when the theater goes dark, the Warner Bros. logo appears 
on the screen. Jimi Hendrix's electric guitar is heard tuning up. The logo 
fades and a rating card appears: "Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Has Been 
Rated R -- Restricted; Under 17 Requires Accompanying Parent or Guardian." 
There is a pause in the guitar licks. Then Hendrix's famed rendition of "The 
Star Spangled Banner" -- the film's closing number -- blares forth. The "R" in 
the rating card catches fire, the word "Restricted" bursts into flames, and a 
fireball burns the warning off the screen. As the smoke clears, only 
"Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music" remains. 
</P>
<P>
 That footage, which Wadleigh wanted to add to protest what he saw as meddling 
by Warners and the MPAA, originally made some at the studio nervous, Warner 
sources said, because they knew it would have to get past the rating board. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end," Wadleigh says, "they stood behind this 100% and that's what 
counts. My hope is that this could trigger a new open dialogue about ratings."  
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1970, before the film's original release, Wadleigh also tussled with 
Warners, over artistic control: The studio wanted the film kept to under two 
hours; Wadleigh and his two assistant directors and supervising editors, Thelma 
Schoonmaker and a very young Martin Scorsese, wanted four. They settled at 
three hours and four minutes, but only after Wadleigh threatened to destroy the 
film if the acts Warners wanted to trim weren't left in. Warners ultimately 
conceded, and the film went on to gross $40 million at the box office and win 
the Oscar that year for best feature documentary (it was also nominated for 
best sound and editing).  
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Woodstock" remains a shining example of history repeating itself. As 
in 1970, Warners is opening the film in just two cities. There are no trailers 
or TV ads promoting the film. There isn't a Woodstock film memento, T-shirt, 
cap or button to be had, although Warners is saying there will be a new 
soundtrack album out later this summer that will chronologically mirror the 
performances on the film, and possibly an interactive CD-ROM tie-in.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the original event was three days long, there is still unculled footage 
that Wadleigh has considered adding.  
</P>
<P>
 "The two bands people always ask me why I didn't include are the Band and the 
Grateful Dead. I love these bands but, quite frankly, their performances just 
weren't there. If I made a five-hour director's cut, I would include them." 
</P>
<P>
 Wadleigh, now 51, says that while he's excited about the chance to retool and 
add to his film, he is nonetheless disheartened by the hype and corporate 
sponsorship of "Woodstock II," the Aug. 13-14 commemorative concert to be held 
in Saugerties, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, Woodstock was rock 'n' roll," he says. "Today, it's Woodstock Rock 'n' 
Roll Inc . Woodstock was about free expression; Woodstock II is about free 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message of Woodstock was to take stock in who you are, to get back to the 
garden of life, to the cathedral of communal spirit where you can get your 
batteries charged. And that is why it became the event that named a 
generation."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: W. H. AUDEN'S STAR RISES 
WITH 'WEDDINGS'; BRITAIN IS QUITE TAKEN WITH ONE OF ITS OWN EXPORTS AND THE 
DEAD POET'S SOCIETY GETS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most memorable sequences in the film "Four Weddings and a Funeral" 
comes during the funeral of a leading character when actor John Hannah delivers 
a moving eulogy and recites a W. H. Auden poem at the funeral of his lover. 
</P>
<P>
 That poem, "Funeral Blues," with its opening lines "Stop all the clocks, cut 
off the telephone/Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone," seems to 
have struck as much of a chord in England as the charming "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral" itself, which opened a month ago to rave reviews and huge box office. 
There is a sudden demand all over England for Auden's works, and his publishers 
Faber & Faber have rushed out a new anthology, "Tell Me the Truth About Love: 
Ten Poems by W. H. Auden," a collection of his verse and cabaret songs from the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Included, naturally, is "Funeral Blues." On the book's cover is Hugh Grant, 
star of "Four Weddings and a Funeral," leaning against a stone column in a 
church and looking mournful. Sales figures are not yet available, but 
booksellers cheerfully report the volume is flying off the shelves of their 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two of the four stanzas of "Funeral Blues" were originally included 
in Auden's 1936 play with his longtime collaborator Christopher Isherwood, "The 
Ascent of F6." Auden then rewrote the poem and offered it to singer Hedli 
Anderson as a cabaret song.  
</P>
<P>
 Auden (1907-73) was born in England but settled in the United States in 1939, 
becoming a citizen in 1946. He finally returned to live in Britain in 1972 and 
became a professor of poetry at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 Auden, as it happens, wrote verse for film in his lifetime. In 1935 he joined 
documentary director John Grierson and composed the poem "Night Mail" to 
accompany footage of a mail train hurtling along a track: "This is the Night 
Mail crossing the border/Bringing the check and the postal order/Letters for 
the rich, letters for the poor/The shop at the corner, the girl next door." The 
rhythm of the verse imitates that of the train. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely reawakening of interest in Auden is testament to the success in 
England of "Four Weddings," the biggest box-office hit for a British film in 
years. It has been No. 1 at the box office since its opening here on May 1 and 
to date has taken in more than $21 million -- which represents 40% of the 
box-office take of the top 15 films now showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some British films -- notably those from the Merchant Ivory team -- 
which suffer a critical backlash in their homeland for their success, most 
commentators here have been genuinely pleased by the popularity of "Four 
Weddings." One of the most remarkable aspects of the film's success is its 
broad appeal: Blue-collar audiences enthuse about it as much as the art-house 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 This was proved beyond all doubt when the Sun, Britain's leading 
sensationalist tabloid, launched a free reader offer for the new Faber & Faber 
Collection. A news story about Auden's work being back in fashion ran beneath 
the headline: "Dead poet is groovy/due to hit movie." 
</P>
<P>
 It is thought unlikely that the Sun's editors recalled Auden's homosexuality 
or his communist sympathies, neither of which would have endeared him to the 
tabloid.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: TRISTAR NOT SO QUICK TO 
RELEASE WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 TriStar's high-profile Western, the Sharon Stone vehicle "The Quick and the 
Dead," has high-tailed it out of town -- at least for the rest of this year, as 
the studio reportedly has become concerned about over-saturation of Westerns, 
as well as overexposure of Stone and co-star Gene Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
 While TriStar President Marc Platt says that a late September or early October 
release had been tentatively planned at the beginning of this year, he insists 
he always wanted to release Sam Raimi's spaghetti-style Western tale of revenge 
next spring, possibly March 21. "It was the filmmakers who really wanted the 
film out in the summer," he now says. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers apparently are willing to bow to the studio's will. "I've had 
pictures come out in the wrong time slot before, so I know the price," says 
Raimi's producing partner, Rob Tapert. "I'm sure TriStar knows best." 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in "The Quick and the Dead" say that TriStar executives were 
worried about the film following a plethora of other Westerns, including 
"Tombstone," "Bad Girls," "Maverick" and Warner Bros.' latest, "Wyatt Earp." 
</P>
<P>
 The last, in particular, concerned the studio because fears are that the 
three-hour length -- despite the star power of Kevin Costner as Earp -- will 
cause box office to drop and perhaps sour moviegoers on Westerns for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 Overexposure to Westerns aside, TriStar sources say, there's a concern about 
seeing Hackman in too many Westerns, period. Hackman, who plays Wyatt Earp's 
father in the Warners film, also starred in the studio's "Unforgiven." And then 
there's Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her last two movies ("Sliver" and "Intersection") haven't performed well," 
notes one source on the project. "The word is TriStar wanted to wait and see 
how 'The Specialist' (an action film due this fall that stars Stone and 
Sylvester Stallone) will do this year. If it does well, TriStar is hoping the 
success will bleed over for Sharon into this picture." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Quick and the Dead" also stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. It 
spins around the story of a woman named Ellen (Stone) who rides into the town 
of Redemption to settle an old score. An expert shot, Ellen soon finds herself 
pulled into a high-stakes shooting tournament staged by the town's kingpin, 
Herod (Hackman), in which gunslingers put their lives on the line for money and 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Raimi's film, there are also rumblings that the release date on 
another TriStar frontier picture, "Legends of the Fall," which stars Anthony 
Hopkins and Brad Pitt, could be moved back a few weeks. Platt says that 
picture's Oct. 7 release may change because of TriStar's four other late-year 
pictures: "Only You," "Lifesavers," "Frankenstein" and "Princess Caraboo."

DANCE; STEPPING IN A NEW DIRECTION; GEMA SANDOVAL IS TURNING HER ATTENTION FROM 
PLAZA DE LA RAZA TO CONCENTRATE ON DANZA FLORICANTO/ USA, A REAFFIRMATION OF 
HER ARTISTIC ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Saturday afternoon in Lincoln Park and the familiar rat-a-tat, rat-a-tat 
of hard-heeled shoes on a wooden floor floats out to the sunny patio courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a nearby room, men in workout togs and women in flowing cotton skirts 
form lines and geometric patterns, recreating rituals of courtship and combat. 
And at the center of this whirl of staccato sound, there's a small woman with a 
timer hung around her neck. Half mom and half coach, she urges the young 
dancers on, unifying them in a single dynamic tableau. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman is Gema Sandoval. The company, Danza Floricanto/USA, is the oldest 
professional Mexican folk troupe in Los Angeles. And the place is Plaza de la 
Raza. All three are fixtures of Eastside community culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But change waits in the wings. Artistic director Sandoval is about to alter 
her course, or at least a major part of it. And even though the redirection 
won't be evident when Danza Floricanto/USA performs as part of the Summer 
Nights series at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre next Sunday, it has already 
begun to have an effect on Plaza de la Raza. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, who has worn two hats for the past six years, is poised to trade 
them in for one. Although she's technically been on vacation for some time, 
Thursday marks her official departure as Plaza de la Raza's executive director. 
She plans to devote herself full-time to Danza Floricanto/USA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval has always identified herself first as an artist. Indeed, as a 
folkloric choreographer, she's built a reputation by infusing her own 
interpretations of Chicano culture, feminism and other contemporary 
perspectives into the tradition of Mexican folk dance. 
</P>
<P>
 And as one of the very few Latina performing arts presenters in the country, 
Sandoval has also become widely known in the national nonprofit arts scene, 
speaking frequently at conferences both in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Danza Floricanto/USA, formerly Floricanto Dance Theatre, was first formed in 
1975. Under Sandoval's direction, it has developed a repertory of costumed 
dances that represent traditions from 17 Mexican states, as well as 
contemporary works created by Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe has danced in Mexico City and Tijuana and performed for Nelson 
Mandela and England's Prince Andrew. It is on the California Arts Council's and 
the Music Center's touring rosters. And they have rat-a-tatted their way into 
the hearts and minds of countless Southland schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 That's partly because there's more to Danza Floricanto/USA than the 
deferential damas and macho men of so many folkloric troupes. Under Sandoval's 
guidance, the group has created a new version of an old style -- a hybrid 
aesthetic that grew out of the choreographer's affection for her own inherited 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what I grew up with, and at some point it didn't say all that I wanted 
it to say," says Sandoval of Mexican folklorico . "That continues to be the 
genre that I understand how to manipulate. That's my language. We are careful 
to maintain the traditional things just so. But what I am trying to say goes 
beyond the Mexican experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the choreographer argues, putting traditional dance onstage is 
already a change. "Even as you put them onstage, you've already violated a 
tradition," she says. "These dances were never meant to go onstage. They were 
meant to be danced as social or religious rites of passage. And now we're using 
it for entertainment purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 To entertain, and to educate, that is. That's why Sandoval often includes 
written or verbal explanations of the dances in her programs, in order to fill 
in whatever knowledge gaps her audience may have. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many things about the Chicano experience that are foreign to the 
rest of the world: the way that we interpret the world, the icons and the 
specific mythology that we work with," she says. "It demystifies it when you 
put it onstage and explain some of it. We all go onstage because we want to 
make ourselves understood." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Sandoval wants understood is that her culture is not static. And one 
change is the comparatively feminist perspective she tries to illustrate 
onstage. "A woman's role in most societies is a passive one," she says. 
"Generally, we wait for things to happen to us and then we react to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't take much to make the dances reflect a more modern point of 
view. "In the specific choreographies that are very traditional, all that I've 
done is made her an active participant," says Sandoval. "That has allowed 
certain choreographic movements that otherwise would not have been possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 "Epopeya Mestiza" (Mestizo Epic) -- a partial new version of which, 
"Jornada Mestiza" (Mestizo Journey), will premiere at the Ford performance -- 
is a showcase for Sandoval's eclectic style. The dance spans five centuries of 
Mexican and Mexican-American history and was created in response to the touring 
exhibition "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries," which was seen at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the troupe premiered another major new work, "America Tropical," 
also on the Ford bill, a suite of social dances set to Latin jazz. The other 
premiere on the Ford program, "California del Ayer, Hoy y Siempre" (California 
of Yesteryears, Today and Always), is a three-part work that embraces both 
early California culture and contemporary music and dance forms such as Norteno 
and Quebradita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the work to be perceived as something that is happening in 
another place at another time," she says. "We are now." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Sandoval sometimes refers to her most contemporary works, which may 
include spoken dramatic narratives, as well as Sandoval's own explanatory 
texts, as her "Chicano" works. "If we continue to do only folkloric, it's not 
the concern of anyone," she says. "I'll do whatever it is I need to do within 
my aesthetic to make it seem to the public today that it's the reality that's 
here in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, after all, means a great deal to Sandoval. Mexican-born, she 
grew up in Los Angeles and went on to study at Cal State Los Angeles and 
Pepperdine. She was a folklorico teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District when she first formed a core dance company with a group of her 
advanced high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, she and her young minions had to find a place to rehearse that 
would be considered neutral turf. "We came here to Plaza de la Raza because we 
wanted to have a place where the kids wouldn't think 'I can't go there because 
only Roosevelt kids go there,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Floricanto has matured concurrently with Sandoval's tenure at Plaza de la 
Raza. She served on the center's board for eight years before becoming 
executive director in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has continued to use the facility to rehearse her company. But 
critics say she may have paid too much attention to the latter and not enough 
to her duties as head of the former. In fact, the most common charge is that 
Sandoval has kept the Eastside venue -- which includes a small theater and a 
number of rehearsal/multi-use halls of varying sizes -- underused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater is a fantastic, underutilized asset," says Sean Carrillo of 
downtown's Troy, a cafe and arts venue that serves as a gathering spot for 
Latino artists and others. "When I produced a show (the Nopalote Awards in 
March 1993) there, I was surprised to find the capabilities of their facilities 
and the technology that was available. All of these things are just locked away 
upstairs somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Sandoval is aware that there has been a problem. "Saturdays and evenings 
I was rehearsing all the time. For six years I tried to do this, and more and 
more the plaza kept infringing on my Floricanto time," Sandoval says. "When we 
(Floricanto) were going on tours, I had to really pull some rank to get out. So 
it was coming closer and closer to a decision time. When I started, it wasn't 
like that at all. It was easy to say, 'this was Plaza time, this was Floricanto 
time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I was beginning to have (to attend to) presenting, classes and the gamut of 
(the activities of) a community arts organization. It was imperative that the 
executive director be part of that. And I was really having a tough time. We 
have been working toward easing me out for a while. I let them know about a 
year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that the parting of ways has been acrimonious persist, although both 
Sandoval and board chairperson/interim director Lydia Lopez deny reports of 
"turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, though, there have been changes. A reconstituted board of directors 
includes four new members. Perhaps the key discussion surrounding Sandoval's 
departure, though, is the broader debate about whether Plaza de la Raza ought 
to continue to be primarily a community arts venue with an emphasis on 
traditional forms, or a more eclectic showcase for all kinds of work by Latino 
artists from all over. 
</P>
<P>
 While a number of Latino artists and others in the community are reluctant to 
speak for attribution on such matters, they place the blame for Plaza de la 
Raza's comparatively low profile in the contemporary arts on Sandoval. It has 
been, they argue, a missed opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 This debate has become more pressing in light of the recent failure of 
Proposition 180, which would have provided $10 million for the state's Latino 
Museum in L.A., which would have no direct affiliation with Plaza de la Raza, 
but would add to the possibilities for exhibiting Latino arts. (That project is 
proceeding, but it won't come to fruition nearly as quickly as it might have, 
had the funds been approved.) 
</P>
<P>
 For Troy's Carrillo, a former member of the avant-garde Chicano artists 
collective ASCO, which was active in the late '70s and early '80s, Plaza de la 
Raza has always been somewhat irrelevant. "Growing up in East L.A., the plaza 
didn't mean anything to me," says Carrillo. "Historically, it never represented 
anything except the arcane and I don't think that ever changed. They stand for 
upholding some kind of traditional cultural values, but those seemed, during a 
period in my life, to be indistinguishable from Olvera Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, no one venue can be all things to all Latinos. And some say that 
Sandoval was in a no-win situation, especially given how few Latino-oriented 
and/or Latino-run venues there are. "The challenge for every arts center is 
being in a position to set up reasonable community expectations for what you 
can deliver with the resources at hand," says California Plaza artistic 
director Michael Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a tendency to demand too much from the few who do hold positions 
of power -- women and men who may want, as Sandoval does, to pursue their own 
individual artistic careers at the same time. "In those communities that have 
been marginalized, when somebody starts to emerge there's sometimes the 
expectation that they're going to be able to meet the needs of everyone," says 
Alexander. "But that sometimes doesn't meet the artistic needs of the 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whether or not Sandoval has been able to meet her own artistic needs, she 
has long brought an important perspective to the regional arts dialogue. "I've 
known her to be an eloquent, frequent voice for the Latino community," 
continues Alexander, who has known Sandoval for more than a decade. "She's been 
a willing contributor of her time, making sure that the arts interests of her 
community are kept in the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Sandoval's future path seems more clear than that of Plaza de la 
Raza. She continues to speak to arts groups across the country and to serve on 
National Endowment for the Arts and other panels. And she plans to start a 
center for folkloric dance and is in the process of finding a site. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sandoval will also continue to be concerned with the particular issues 
that face Latino artists, and with the strategies for their advancement. "One 
of the things that we people of color -- particularly second and third 
generation -- are used to doing is straddling two cultures," she says. "The 
secret of our success is going to be the ability to straddle two different 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you straddle, you bring some of the one side to the other, so 
there's a continuous tainting of the two cultures going on. But it creates 
synthesis in the end."

M PEOPLE: A SONG AND DANCE ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST HARDY, Ernest Hardy is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 London's M People is a hit dance group on a mission -- in fact, a couple of 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 In dance music -- a pop genre where the emphasis is normally on technology and 
grooves -- group founder Mike Pickering is interested in songs . 
</P>
<P>
 Pickering, who finds inspiration in dance music's R&B origins, rather than the 
icy, techno grooves that currently dominate the field, also goes against the 
conventional dance grain by relying on live instrumentation rather than 
recycled samples to bring those songs alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be successful, of course," says Pickering, who speaks about his 
work in a refreshingly down-to-earth manner. "But we want to do it on our own 
terms. We won't compromise our beliefs just for the sake of succeeding, and we 
believe that this approach is not only good for us, but healthy for dance music 
in general." 
</P>
<P>
 While the electronic-leaning techno and rave cultures have largely replaced 
dance music's soul and passion with trippy artiness or the relentless assault 
of spine-shattering beats, M People blends the savvy of classic Motown, the 
sweaty grooves of Booker T. & the MG's and state-of-the-art dance nuances into 
a cool and classy dance-pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Already Pickering's strong vision has steered M People, a group he founded 
four years ago in London as a vanity project, to six Top 10 hits on the British 
pop charts and a critically acclaimed European tour. The group's "Moving on Up" 
was a recent No. 1 dance hit in the United States, where it has now crossed 
over into the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's U.S. debut album on Epic, titled "Elegant Slumming" and due in 
stores Tuesday, is a funk-driven collection of dynamic grooves and potently 
crafted pop lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "To us, the most important element in the music is the song, which I think is 
something we get from old soul records," says Pickering, 33, by phone from his 
home in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to love that Motown gave you 3 1/2 minutes of tightly structured, 
beautiful songs, wonderful melodies and great lyrics. We feel that songs are 
timeless, and the various mixes you give it are just the flavor of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics are sung by Heather Small, another key element in the group's 
appeal. She provides not only a striking visual identity, but a sonic one as 
well, possessing a husky, powerful voice with a maturity far beyond her 27 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Flick, dance music editor for Billboard magazine, raves about both Small 
and the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "M People grew from a simple deejay project into a legitimate, powerhouse act 
and Heather is a crucial reason why," he says. "She's got a very unusual voice; 
she doesn't sound or look like every other little girl singer out there. You've 
got to see her and the group live to truly appreciate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickering agrees with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that until people see us live, they won't totally get the vibe," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were doing the European tour, we'd already gotten good press clips on 
the album, but the critics were astonished that we could actually play and play 
well. See, a lot of traditional rock critics think there are no viable acts in 
dance music, none that can cut it live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept arguing the point with the press, offering up examples like Kool & 
the Gang and Earth, Wind & Fire, but then we realized we couldn't name any 
contemporary acts. That's really sad for dance music fans, because that means 
they can't belong to a dance act the way you can a rock act. You can't buy the 
album, see them live and forge a connection, and I think that's really 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickering began formalizing his musical instincts as a popular club deejay in 
London in the late '80s. He eventually channeled his expertise into a 
high-profile career as a remixer for such English artists as ABC, New Order, 
Jomanda and countless others. He also produced alternative rock acts such as 
Happy Mondays and James, and some underground soul acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanting to stretch his talents, he decided four years ago to put together a 
music collective. Modeled after Soul II Soul, which had big hits with "Back to 
Life" and "Keep on Movin'," it would have a variety of guest vocalists giving 
life to his musical ideas. His goal was to put together a collective where he 
could draw from both the early American R&B he'd been obsessed with as a child 
and the dance music he now loved. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted someone with more actual musical training than he had, and found him 
in Paul Heard, who'd not only studied music in college, but had also worked in 
the music department of the BBC. The two instantly clicked, and Heard, 33, now 
plays bass and keyboards in the M People. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost immediately became a partnership," says Pickering, "and we quickly 
set out writing songs with Heather's voice in mind. She was in a soul group 
called Hot House at the time and we were huge fans of her voice. She agreed to 
sing some of the songs for us and just as she did, Hot House broke up. That's 
really when M People, which was going to stand for Mike's People, was born." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new group worked quickly in the studio, releasing three singles, "Colour 
My Life," "Excited" and "How Can I Love You More," in 1991. All went into the 
Top 10 of the U.K. pop charts. Those tracks eventually made their way across 
the Atlantic to become underground club hits as imports, generating a huge buzz 
about M People. Those three singles are included on the U.S. version of 
"Elegant Slumming," which is actually the group's second album. 
</P>
<P>
 Their debut album, "Northern Soul," which also includes the premiere singles, 
was released in 1992 to widespread critical acclaim. A subsequent tour 
established the M People as one of the U.K.'s top live bands. By using the 
musicians who'd played on its records for the tour, M People distanced itself 
from the lip-sync stereotype of dance artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 release of "Elegant Slumming" in the U.K. yielded three more Top 10 
hits -- "One Night in Heaven," "Moving on Up" and a version of Dennis Edwards' 
R&B staple "Don't Look Any Further" -- and the stateside buzz intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that the music has actual weight is one of Pickering's main goals, one 
that's nearly as important as actually making the music. From the album's title 
(lifted from author Tom Wolfe's withering description of New York socialites 
who threw fund-raisers for the Black Panther Party) to the music's ability to 
unite various elements of society, Pickering sees a powerful political subtext 
in the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dance music brings far more people together than any rock music does," he 
insists. "It speaks to youth culture because it tends to have a far more 
optimistic message than rock music. I think young people these days, in 
England, throughout Europe, and even in the States, they need hope. They don't 
need to be told they are living in a (expletive) hole. They know they are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the U.S. release of "Elegant Slumming" (which is made up of five tracks 
each from their two U.K. efforts), Pickering intends to bring the same positive 
vibe to U.S. fans that has made the outfit one of dance music's great hopes in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the main thing with M People is optimism and self-belief," he 
explains. "That's why the dance scene is so big here. We've had some lean years 
and people want to hear something other than a band telling them that 
everything is doom and gloom and that they're all finished. That's one of the 
reasons the album has the title it does." 
</P>
<P>
 How does Wolfe's putdown of pseudo-political socialites convey hope? 
</P>
<P>
 Pickering chuckles. "Initially," he admits, "I just liked the sound of 
'elegant slumming.' But in England, if you have no money it's called slumming. 
I just felt that for a group of young people who have no money, who are so 
oppressed by a variety of social and political circumstances, they slummed very 
elegantly."

 NUMBERS 5 & 6: Harmon Killebrew hit 573 home runs in his career, fifth on the 
all-time list. Former Angel Reggie Jackson was just behind him, at 563. Maybe 
Reggie can even the score a little. . . . The two Hall of Famers headline a 
short exhibition softball game today at Anaheim Stadium, a prelude to the 
Angels-Texas Rangers game. Other big names: former Rams runner Eric Dickerson 
and USC basketball's Cheryl Miller. It's a traveling road show for Upper Deck, 
the baseball card makers.

<P>
 FAIREST FOULS: Baseball statisticians don't keep books on where the most foul 
balls get hit. But one veteran Anaheim Stadium usher (he prefers anonymity) 
offers some advice: "The best place to sit is Field Level. . . . Foul balls are 
a result of what pitchers throw. If you've got a junk baller, batters hit more 
fouls. . . . Also, left-handers foul to the right, right-handers foul left."

 BEYOND GEORGE: The upcoming issue of Rolling Stone features the growing 
success of the Offspring, and notes that the punk band is from Orange County 
"where the pace is slower . . . and the folks all voted for George Bush." . . . 
But the article quotes the band's lead singer Bryan Holland saying in defense: 
"People don't realize that there is stuff in Orange County that's kind of cool, 
too. I like to go down to bars on (Huntington Beach's) Main Street, especially 
this place Taxi -- it's down to earth. . . . Plus the beaches are really the 
best."

 SLOOP SCOOP: Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa owes thanks to Michigan 
multimillionaire Jack Batts, and he's not even an alumnus. Batts wanted to give 
his 64-foot sloop Volcano to a deserving school. After shopping around, he 
chose Orange Coast, and its much-acclaimed sailing program. . . . "It was 
important to me that she go to a school that will use her for education," Batts 
says. Volcano will be part of the support fleet heading to Hawaii next summer 
for the 1995 Trans-Pacific Yacht Race.

 CALL BOXES: You've just had a flat on the freeway, and you're about to have a 
fit. What's a panic-stricken motorist to do? Easy -- use the call box. After 
all, everyone else does. In fact, people make more than 40,000 calls per month 
on county freeways. . . . In the Valley, boxes near the San Diego Freeway and 
Sepulveda Boulevard get plenty of action, and are among a variety of devices 
that improve flow and safety of area freeways. See Valley Briefing. (B2)

 DUMP PROTEST: About two dozen environmentalists protested at Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill north of Granada Hills for the second day Saturday, as work crews 
continued clearing 3,000 California live oak trees to expand the dump. 
Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., the dump's owner, began using a fire road to 
get equipment in and out of the remote site after the city ordered BFI not to 
use a city-owned road. . . . Tying up the fire road is dangerous, said Rosemary 
Woodlock, lawyer for the North Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens, an 
environmental group. "We'll certainly raise that issue," Woodlock said, when 
the group goes back to court Monday in a second bid to keep BFI from removing 
any more trees until several legal issues are resolved.

 STALEMATE: Valley-area Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale) have opposite -- and strongly held -- views on health 
care. Waxman favors the Clinton approach, which would require employers to pay 
to insure their workers. Moorhead is adamantly against it. . . . Despite the 
stalemate tying up their congressional committee, Waxman thinks Congress will 
pass some kind of health care bill before the November elections. (B1)

TEENS' FAMILIES HAD NO HINT OF VIOLENT ENDING; TRAGEDY: RELATIVES STRUGGLE TO 
COPE WITH DEATHS OF SANTA ANA BOY, 16, WHO KILLED PREGNANT 14-YEAR-OLD AND THEN 
HIMSELF.

<P>
 Several days ago, 14-year-old Rosa Maria Vargas told her family that she had 
seen in her room a vision of a boyfriend who was killed in August by a stray 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'He wanted me to come with him, but I didn't want to,' and she was 
crying," recalled her 18-year-old sister, Betty Vargas. "My mother told her 
that it was just a dream, but she insisted that he had stood near her." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Vargas was shot in the head in front of her mother by a boy she 
had been dating and broke up with a week ago. The girl, who was three months 
pregnant, staggered from the lawn to the front door of her family's home, where 
she died. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, 16-year-old Victor Torres Chavez, also of Santa Ana, ran down the 
street and shot himself in the head with a .38-caliber revolver, police said. 
He died instantly, just a few doors down from the Vargas house in the 3300 
block of South Park Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning, the families of both teens gathered in their separate homes 
to mourn. Vargas' family said Chavez had not wanted her to have friends and 
apparently exploded when she wouldn't see him any more.  
</P>
<P>
 His family was bewildered and said he was not a violent teen. They said they 
had no idea Chavez had a gun or that he was heading to Vargas' house Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told his mom he was going to get his hair cut," said cousin Yolanda 
Torres, 23. "Then police came and told us he's dead. And that's all we know. We 
know nothing else. We're so confused by this whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas and Chavez had met through friends in December, said Blanca Lopez, 15, 
who was Vargas' best friend at Saddleback High School until Chavez came along. 
</P>
<P>
 "She stopped talking to all her friends. He didn't want her to," said Lopez, 
as she sat in the living room of the Vargas' home Saturday afternoon, her eyes 
red-rimmed with tears. "I thought Victor was going to pass, that she'll come 
back to us. Why did he have to do this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Vargas was the fourth of seven children. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Vargas said her sister began to ditch school when she started dating 
Chavez, who attended Horizon Education Center, an independent study program. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez had dropped out of high school, but his brother, 18-year-old Alex, 
didn't know when. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a bad influence on her," Betty Vargas said. "He was jealous of her 
attention and didn't want her talking to anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez often came to his girlfriend's house drunk and once, at a movie 
theater, had tried to punch her, said Vargas' brother, 15-year-old Jacob. But 
the boyfriend missed and his fist hit a wall instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing that her daughter's relationship was unhealthy, Rosa Avita Vargas, 39, 
had counseled the teen to stop dating Chavez. She said she was glad when the 
younger Rosa obeyed. The family also agreed that the girl would keep her baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was innocent in her own way," Betty Vargas said. "She loved to baby-sit 
my children and was looking forward to having her own."  
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was at home Friday night with her family when Chavez knocked on 
the door at 7:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 He had asked a friend to give him a bike ride to the Vargas home, according to 
Sgt. Dick Faust. Vargas came outside so the two could return to each other 
mementos they had exchanged during the six-month relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother followed and urged her to come back inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy asked the girl if the child she was carrying was his, and her mother 
told him he didn't have to worry about it, family members said. Then, Chavez 
pulled the handgun from his waistband and shot at the mother, but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom said the bullet hit the wall, and she turned around and saw Rosa 
trying to push Victor away," Betty Vargas said, crying. "We think that's when 
he shot again, and this time the bullet hit my sister in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 He shot several times at her, bullets piercing her neck and arm, Jacob Vargas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's friend, Juan Chavez, 21, fled at this point. He was later questioned 
by police and released, Faust said. He is not related to Victor Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Vargas said he was in the shower when he heard three shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran out and my mom was screaming, 'He shot her! He shot her!' Then I saw my 
sister lying there," he said, pointing to the front doorsteps. "I ran out to 
see if I could catch him, but he had already shot himself. He was lying in the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back and held my sister," Jacob continued in a dazed voice. "I was 
telling her not to leave us. But she already was dead. I felt her pulse and 
there was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a mile away in the 200 block of Alton Avenue, Chavez's relatives 
also were crying. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old was the youngest of five children, and "he was quiet, he kept 
to himself," brother Alex Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family said they didn't know whether he and his girlfriend had had 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives had met Rosa Vargas a month ago when the 14-year-old had stayed at 
the Chavez home for about a week, cousin Torres said. Vargas then returned to 
her own home at her mother's insistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two of them would joke around. I never saw them arguing," she said. "But 
I don't know what they did when they were alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The family said Chavez had never shown any signs that he was capable of 
hurting himself or others.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was not violent," Torres said. "We never thought he was going to go do 
that. You know, he was a nice guy, too."

ROOFING FIRM FACES RECORD INS FINE FOR ILLEGAL WORKER FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An Orange roofing contractor is facing the largest fine ever levied by the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for allegations that the company 
knowingly hired undocumented immigrants and then forged employment forms, the 
federal agency has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 INS agents served Honeycutt Tearoff, Inc. Friday with a notice of a 
$1.2-million intended fine after an 18-month investigation revealed the 
violations, said Rico Cabrera, spokesman for the Los Angeles district office of 
the INS, which covers Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the INS, the fine is the largest combination civil document fraud 
and employer sanctions case in the agency's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials could not be reached for comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, sanctions can be levied 
when employers fail to certify that employees are U.S. citizens or legal 
residents. According to Cabrera, Honeycutt is being fined $252,235 for 
knowingly hiring undocumented workers and failing to comply with INS 
record-keeping requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the fine is being levied for alleged document fraud, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the allegations, company president John Honeycutt fabricated and 
backdated employment eligibility documents in an attempt to pass an INS 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Case agents working closely with handwriting and document experts at the INS 
Forensic Document Laboratory in McLean, Va., found discrepancies in the 
documents, Cabrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, the federal government collected $5.2 million in fines under 
the employer sanctions provision of the immigration reform law, $1.1 million of 
it from California and other western states. 
</P>
<P>
 Honeycutt can request a hearing before an administrative law judge. Some fined 
employers have reached settlements with the agency for a lower fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Disneyland paid $260,000 to settle allegations of shoddy 
record-keeping that violated federal immigration laws. An INS investigation 
last year found 1,156 violations in the employee records of more than 6,000 
Disneyland employees, including evidence of counterfeit documents such as 
Social Security cards and green cards. 
</P>
<P>
 A Georgia peach firm was fined $1.1 million in 1992 for knowingly hiring 
illegal immigrants, at that time the largest such penalty ever levied against a 
U.S. employer.

HIGH-TECH REFERENCE POINT; FACILITY: SCIENCE LIBRARY THAT WILL OPEN TUESDAY AT 
UCI HOUSES BOOKS AND CUTTING-EDGE LEARNING EQUIPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The largest medical and science library in California, featuring more than 
2,000 desks and chairs, up to half a million books and the latest in library 
technology, is opening this week at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-story high-tech Science Library -- between the School of Biological 
Sciences and the College of Medicine -- cost $33.5 million, all coming from 
state revenue and general obligation bonds, UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It can hold as many as 500,000 texts, has about 2,200 reader stations and 
features a study center that will be open 24 hours during midterm and final 
exams. The library will open to the public at 8 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget problems have hampered UCI and threatened to close some departments, 
but the library project went ahead. The project, which began in 1987, 
"addresses a longtime need for additional library space at UCI and was on the 
books before the budget cuts of recent years," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI political science senior Mike Ross has seen the library evolve from a hole 
in the ground to an earth-toned, high-tech learning center. "I'm super 
pleased," said Ross, the on-site building manager. "I can't wait to move in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Ross surveyed the library from floor to floor, dodging 
scurrying workers moving thick, dusty books back and forth on plywood dollies. 
Maroon-colored shelves will house the books, protected from outside light by 
translucent plastic walls. 
</P>
<P>
 In areas of the library where clear glass windows rise from floor to ceiling, 
photocells detect light that might harm books and set off mechanisms that lower 
blinds to shield books from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty high-tech," Ross said.  
</P>
<P>
 To show what he meant, Ross brushed by a steel water fountain and moved his 
hand. Water arched and burbled from a valve. "Motion detector," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At four kiosks in the library, visitors will be able to get maps of the 
library by touching a computer screen, Ross said. Students will take classes 
and find pictures and articles on CD-ROMs -- compact discs that hold vast 
amounts of data -- in the library's interactive learning center. 
</P>
<P>
 Library employees will carry personalized cards that they must run through 
security boxes before entering stairwells, Ross said, and graduate students 
will get cards that they can use to access rooms in the building that other 
students may not use. 
</P>
<P>
 By installing such security measure, university officials hope to keep the 
collections of valuable books intact, he said. Balconies will be kept locked so 
that no one can throw books out windows and down to other people below. 
</P>
<P>
 Builders have also included details that will help students keep up with 
educational technology. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 450 computer outlets dotting walls throughout the library will allow 
students and other patrons to access databases with laptop computers. When the 
outlets are activated in 1995, students will be able to link their computers 
with Internet, a network of thousands of computer systems from around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will also be able to retrieve articles and poems that are not 
copyrighted through computers, Ross said, as well as archive photographs such 
as images from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can come in, plug in their computers and bring things right up on 
their screen," he said. Students who copy texts from the database onto their 
computers can take the texts home without lugging stacks of photocopies or 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are emptying the Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences and Biomedical 
libraries of books and hauling them to the new library, Ross said. Those 
libraries will be turned into office and class space by their departments, he 
said, but the Main Library will stay open. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI is part of a nationwide movement among academic and public libraries to 
upgrade equipment, officials at colleges and universities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Cal State Fullerton broke ground in February for its nearly 
$30-million library expansion, including $4.6 million in CD-ROM equipment and 
other computer resources.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Chapman University in Orange also are upgrading equipment and 
plan to have several academic journals available to students on computers by 
the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton and Newport Beach public libraries are two of about 170 in the state 
that received grants to install computers that allow patrons to use Internet, 
Fullerton Public Library director Al Melo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new technology is going to come whether we want it or not," Melo said. 
"If we don't (upgrade) now, two years from now, we'll be that much further 
behind." Largest Science Library in California 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine's new Science Library will feature advanced computer access to 
information. Science and technology collections, now stored in four different 
places on campus, will be centralized at the library. Basics Cost: $33.5 
million * Designer: British architect James Stirling * Book, materials area: 
About 131,000 square feet * Capacity: About 500,000 books * Opens: Tuesday

BILL BOYARSKY: TRYING CRIMINAL CASES IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of concern is being expressed about the impact of pretrial publicity on 
the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Superior Court Judge Cecil J. Mills, saying grand jurors had been 
exposed to such pretrial publicity, halted their work while they were 
considering an indictment of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one day earlier, our top law enforcement officials took a vow of silence 
after Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn released the now-famous 911 tapes to 
news organizations that had requested them under the California Public Records 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a little late. By the time prosecutors took the pledge, potential 
jurors all over the county had heard or read the taped dialogue between a 
frightened Nicole Brown Simpson, the 911 operator and a man, identified as O.J. 
Simpson, cursing and screaming in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 You may wonder why the tapes were released at all. Or why they were broadcast 
or printed. Or why prosecutors, cops and the defense have furnished so much 
information to the news media since before Simpson's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple. This is the way the criminal justice system works. Even 
before presenting the case in the official court, each side battles in the 
court of public opinion. This is done to create a favorable atmosphere in the 
community and to influence potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the prosecutors and the defense use the news media to reach this 
unofficial but important court. In addition, the press acts as a watchdog, on 
the lookout for bungling or corrupt cops, attorneys and judges. For better or 
for worse, we in the news business are part of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not new. It's been going on since the modern newspaper came into 
existence in the late 19th Century. The process has been magnified and 
intensified by the immediacy and power of television. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm an expert on pretrial publicity because that's what I used to do for a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 I started out in the Wild West newspaper world of the 1950s, working for the 
Oakland Tribune across the bay from San Francisco. The Tribune and the four San 
Francisco dailies fiercely competed on every big crime story. My paper had at 
least six editions a day, and when there was a hot murder, the editors wanted a 
new headline for each of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was especially rough when 14-year-old Stephanie Bryan vanished 
on her way home from junior high school in Berkeley. Suspicion quickly turned 
to Burton Abbott, a 28-year-old University of California accounting major whose 
wife found Stephanie's wallet and purse in their basement. 
</P>
<P>
 As a copy messenger, I watched from the sidelines as our star reporters 
battled their rivals on the other papers in a search for Stephanie. Her body 
was found by a reporter, Ed Montgomery of the San Francisco Examiner. He 
traveled to the far Northern California mountains where the Abbotts had a 
summer cabin. He and a local rancher's team of dogs found the body buried about 
100 yards from the cabin, a discovery that eventually sent Abbott to the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The story taught me about competition, a lesson I took with me when I was 
promoted to reporter. I worked in the old Oakland City Hall, in a pressroom 
decorated with bullet holes left by the cops who came in at night to drink with 
the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of my job was covering the detectives. Trying to stay ahead, I 
worked hard at trying to develop inside sources. Deputy Chief Jack Brierly, in 
charge of the detectives, was a friend of my boss and gave me inside 
information. I also got news about the various accused suspects when I talked 
each morning with the Oakland Police Department's top homicide detective, Lt. 
Hubert Murray. He's an ace investigator whom my colleague, Al Martinez, then a 
young Tribune reporter, called "the Human Lie Detector." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the suspect was ready for trial, the cops' case had pretty well 
been presented in the newspaper. This was somewhat balanced by tips and 
insights from media-wise defense lawyers, who gained favor with the pressroom 
crew by sending them bottles of whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure civil libertarians, law school professors and journalism ethicists 
look down on such practices. I, on the other hand, look upon it as an education 
that gives me a unique perspective on the Simpson case and others like it. 
</P>
<P>
 I am offended when incorrect information makes the news. But that's a question 
of accuracy, not the idea of reporters investigating a crime on their own, 
gathering information and, yes, accepting leaks from reliable unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
 We need all of that, and I'll tell you why. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the defense, prosecution, cops and judges often fight in public, the 
criminal justice system is really a tight, elitist club. Its members don't want 
the press snooping around or the public let in on the way the system works. 
</P>
<P>
 The press is the public's representative in this process, breaking through the 
secrecy in search of corruption, error and miscarriages of justice. There have 
been cases, not just in the movies, in which dedicated reporters have saved 
innocent men and women from the mistakes of bungling defense attorneys, 
overzealous prosecutors and bad judges. Reporters have also found evidence 
overlooked by the criminal justice system, just the way the Examiner's Ed 
Montgomery did with his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity this week got me thinking about all I've learned since my first 
job and those morning talks with Lt. Murray, the Human Lie Detector. 
</P>
<P>
 What would I do, I wondered, if I were reporting the Simpson story and a 
latter-day Hubie Murray, a person of the same reliability and honesty, leaked 
some important information to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Would I say: "Lieutenant, stop, I don't want to listen to you. You are 
violating my journalistic ethics"? Today's ethicists frown on anonymous sources 
or buddying up to cops. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a chance. I'd take notes, read his reports, do more reporting, and if the 
information checked out, call my boss and say: "I've got a hell of a story."

SOCCER TEAM, HOST FAMILIES BUILD BONDS THAT LAST; SPORTS: OVER THE PAST TWO 
YEARS, WORLD CUP PLAYERS HAVE BEEN WELCOMED INTO THE HOMES -- AND HEARTS -- OF 
SOUTH COUNTY RESIDENTS.

<P>
 On a suddenly red-hot U.S. soccer team, Tony Meola is a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 He is young, photogenic, a budding movie star who has been on the cover of 
national news and sports magazines -- one of the few team members who draws 
stares on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the eyes of three young sisters from Mission Viejo, the international 
soccer star is just Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 For Riki-Ann, Lindsey and Stacy Serrins, Meola, 25, is like a big brother who 
pops in occasionally to muss their hair, play video games and use the family 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes over for dinner lots. He plays games with us. He's fun," said Stacy 
Serrins, 12. "It's like having a big brother around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Serrins are one of several families who have hosted Meola and other U.S. 
players since the team arrived at their Mission Viejo training site in 
December, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 For 18 months, these surrogate families fed the players home-cooked meals and 
helped familiarize them with local banks, restaurants and post offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really a support group for them," said John Bolger, whose family hosted 
star midfielder Claudio Reyna. "We've all made ourselves available as best we 
can to be a help to these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 And in some cases, as the months preceding the World Cup steadily passed, the 
bonds grew. 
</P>
<P>
 When Meola married last August, the Serrins flew to New Jersey for the 
wedding. The Meolas and the Serrins do the small things families and friends do 
together: go to dinner, movies and spend time at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relationship that has evolved tremendously over the last year and a 
half," said Phil Serrins, a local chiropractor. "Tony is a man who is very 
family-oriented, and he's really taken to our girls. He loves being part of a 
family unit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo Soccer Foundation, which brokered the deal that brought the 
U.S. team to Mission Viejo, also found the 20 or so host families and matched 
them with players. 
</P>
<P>
 Team member Thomas Dooley, a German with dual citizenship, could speak 
English, but his wife's grasp of the language was limited. The foundation found 
Tom and Mirid Weidner, a German-speaking family. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dinners and outings later, Dooley said, "It's like we found some very 
good friends in a new place. We'll be friends long after the World Cup is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the families are foundation members and part of the Mission Viejo 
soccer community, a city that was crazy about the sport long before the United 
States beat Colombia in World Cup action on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 With 3,700 boys and girls enrolled in leagues, Mission Viejo has the second 
largest American Youth Soccer Organization group in the country. Soccer clubs 
for adults and children play almost year-round throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer also is big in the surrounding South County area: Almost 10,000 kids 
play in organized leagues throughout the Saddleback and Capistrano valleys. 
Current U.S. soccer team member Joe-Max Moore graduated from Capistrano Valley 
High School and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a soccer mecca," foundation President Bill Irvine said. "Kids around 
here grow up playing soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 After the foundation succeeded in attracting the U.S. soccer team, its next 
dream was to have the players become part of the community, Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't ask for a nicer, more caring, family-oriented group of guys," he 
said. "The team has given clinics, visited hospitals and given more of 
themselves to our kids than we had a right to ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Posing for pictures with their host families after a practice last week, team 
members were polite but stiff before the media. But afterward, with a couple of 
soccer balls and a handful of kids to play with, players changed.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sorber spun Anthony Santoro, 10, and Joseph Griffith, 8, in dizzying 
circles as he weaved up and down the field playing keep away. Normally intense 
and serious, Meola smiled broadly and joked with the Serrins girls as he hooked 
a few corner kicks toward a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always have time for the children, and the kids love them," said Debra 
Griffith, whose family hosts Marcelo Balboa. "We spend a great deal of time 
cutting out articles and finding posters that Marcelo is in. 
</P>
<P>
 "My oldest boy shags balls on the (training center soccer) field and has the 
greatest time," she said. "My boys know this is a wonderful experience, but I 
think many years from now it's really going to hit them that 'Wow, I was part 
of the World Cup.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The only negative experience for some of the families came in recent months as 
players were cut from the U.S. squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really hard for those families to see their players get cut from the 
team," she said. "They had gotten to know these players and now they have to 
move on. We all felt really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the United States advances through the tournament, knowing the players 
personally is making the World Cup an even more exciting experience for the 
host families. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these are all pretty dedicated fans to begin with," Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine and Phil Serrins were part of a group of Mission Viejo fans who flew to 
Detroit last week to watch the team's first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our personal relationships with the players, we were really 
pumped," Serrins said. "I'll tell you how strong the feeling was: the weather 
was miserable. It was at least 90 degrees and humid. But we were so excited 
(watching the team tie Switzerland), we were still getting goose bumps." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the World Cup is over, no matter how the U.S. team does, Serrins said his 
family will treasure its relationship with the Meolas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes beyond soccer," he said. "The Meolas and our family will be friends 
forever."

POND SHOWCASES LATINO ICON; EVENT: JUAN GABRIEL SHOW REPRESENTS VENUE'S FIRST 
BIG VENTURE GEARED TO COUNTY'S BIGGEST MINORITY GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In The Pond of Anaheim's first big-league venture into the Latino market, 
Mexican crooner and pop idol Juan Gabriel opened Saturday night in a flash of 
smoke and light to a crowded house of screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond has been the site of a mariachi festival, but this was the first pop 
event geared almost exclusively to a Latino audience.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's fabulous. It's a great privilege to have an artist of this magnitude 
here," said 31-year-old Patricia Patino, who eagerly awaited the first number 
arm-in-arm with her mother, Guillermina Leon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I've been to the Arena and I said, 'I'm not going to miss 
this chance.' There are enough Latinos living in this part of the county, so we 
hope this isn't the last time," said Patino, who moved to Orange from Mexico 
City eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Juan Gabriel walked onto The Pond's square stage in a modest blue 
suit, under flashing green and fuchsia lights and rising smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Well after the show began, people of all ages continued to stream into the 
arena. Some came in sequins and formal lace gowns. Others were in denim shorts 
and cowboy hats. They were families with small children, young couples on 
dates, grandparents and small packs of teen-age girls with chaperones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel great," said Graciela Esquivel, 36, of Placentia. "A lot of 
people are dying to see him. For all Latinos, he's a Number 1 performer." 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old Latin pop icon has played to sold-out shows at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, and a 1990 concert at Santa Ana Stadium drew 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 75,000 fans packed the Rose Bowl in Pasadena for a spectacle that 
rivaled a Michael Jackson's performance in splash.  
</P>
<P>
 Juan Gabriel -- who uses only his two first names and no surname -- was 
hoisted through a hole in the center of the stage for his opening act, wearing 
a golden cape. 
</P>
<P>
 The pop star has written more than 600 songs, mainly romantic ballads, many of 
which have been recorded by other artists, and has sold more than 15 million 
albums worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 His dip into mariachi and ranchera music give him a traditional appeal, and 
even the raw Mexican rock band, Maldita Vecindad, does a hard-core cover of 
Juan Gabriel's "Querida. "  
</P>
<P>
 Juan Gabriel was raised from age 2 in an orphanage in Ciudad Juarez in the 
state of Chihuahua after his father died and his mother went to work as a 
housekeeper and was too burdened to care for him. He began his recording career 
in his late teens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl show was a benefit for an orphanage that the singer opened in 
Chihuahua in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In a break from the traditional mainstream Latin romantic pop, Juan Gabriel 
draws on his childhood experiences to present a softer, more sensitive image. 
</P>
<P>
 His soft side attracts die-hard fans such as Vicky Ortega, 40, of South Gate, 
secretary of the L.A.-based "Club Amigos Unidos de Juan Gabriel." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega came to the Pond Saturday with her husband and a Volkswagen bus full of 
friends and relatives, who geared up for the evening listening to Juan Gabriel 
CDs and enjoyed tortas, tostadas and beer in the parking lot while swapping 
stories about their idol. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega's fan club has about 20 members -- most of them women. They celebrate 
his birthdays, travel to Texas, Las Vegas and Tijuana to catch his shows, and 
volunteer in his honor at Ninos del Barrio, an L.A. children's advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped me a lot. I was a solitary person in my teens and early 20s," said 
Ortega, who brought the club's trademark white and red satin jacket to wave at 
the stage Saturday night because the summer heat kept her from wearing it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got to know him through the radio and he got to me through his music. He 
kept me going." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega's friend, 38-year-old Rosa Vasquez of Maywood, got hooked on the star 
in junior high, when he was barely known and played The Million Dollar, a 
popular Los Angeles nightspot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a problem in love, once you get in there, you forget about it," 
said Vasquez. "He's our star." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Hispanic you feel proud," added Juanito Ortega, Vicky's husband. "The 
first Hispanic to sing at the Rose Bowl was Juan Gabriel. This is a great thing 
to come down to Orange County and see Juan Gabriel here, for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Juan Gabriel's new album, "Gracias por Esperar" ("Thanks for 
Waiting") is scheduled to be released on BMG International, a U.S. release of 
his first studio album in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The record has already sold more than half a million copies in Mexico, and the 
single, "Pero Que Necesidad" ("But What is the Need?") has been playing for 
more than a month on Spanish language radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It talks about a lady who he wants to be with, but he knows she is not for 
him," said Juanito Ortega. "His music, once you start listening to it, it will 
transport you. It will take you to another dimension. You feel part of him and 
part of everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 For Willie Rodriguez Sr., 72, of Covina, and his on, 37-year-old Willie 
Rodriguez Jr. of Ontario, Saturday's concert brought a touch of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, from Ciudad Juarez, lived down the street from the pop star and used 
to see him perform at the Noa Noa -- a little nightclub that the performer 
later immortalized in a song of that title. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the greatest Mexicans who have ever been," said the elder 
Rodriguez, who was treated to the concert by his son as a Father's Day gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the world, he's in the top 10," said Rodriguez Jr. "I think it's good he 
came to Orange County. There are a lot of Latino families here."

FANS CELEBRATING MEXICO'S WIN TURN ROWDY, LOOT STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A festive World Cup celebration turned violent in Huntington Park late Friday 
as about 5,000 fans, jubilant over Mexico's win earlier in the day, threw rocks 
and bottles at police, fired guns into the air and looted stores in the city's 
central business district, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and 30 officers from Huntington 
Park and neighboring cities responded to the incident, believed to be the first 
violence in the United States linked to the monthlong soccer tournament. World 
Cup officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out with everybody in a festive mood," Huntington Park Police Sgt. 
Tom Weselis said of the partying. "The celebrating just got out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a bystander, Jose Zaragosa of Los Angeles, was struck in the leg 
by gunfire. He was treated at White Memorial Medical Center in Boyle Heights 
and released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Huntington Park police officers sustained minor injuries and one 
sheriff's deputy suffered a badly bruised elbow and thigh when he was struck by 
a car driven by a soccer fan. The deputy, whose name was withheld, was treated 
at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood and released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Julio Centano, 18, of Boyle Heights was arrested on suspicion of 
assaulting a peace officer with a deadly weapon, said sheriff's spokesman Ron 
Spear. Centano was being held at the Lynwood sheriff's station in lieu of 
$50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said 3,000 to 5,000 fans poured onto Pacific Boulevard just north of 
Florence Avenue throughout Friday to celebrate Mexico's 2-1 win over Ireland. 
Within minutes of the game's finish, just before noon, hundreds of cheering 
fans began to appear on the busy thoroughfare, the center of Huntington Park's 
bustling business district, Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park police attempted to maintain calm throughout the day but were 
pelted with rocks and bottles as the mood of the crowd grew more aggressive 
into the evening, Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three or four Pacific Boulevard businesses had their windows broken and were 
looted, but police were uncertain of the extent of the damage. Weselis said 
several Huntington Park police cars were damaged by rocks and bottles and 
police car windshields were shattered. He estimated the damage at about $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and sheriff's deputies moved in to disperse the crowd about 11:30 p.m., 
but many celebrants began driving through the area in caravans and continued to 
block streets. "It was bumper to bumper on Pacific," Weselis said. "The street 
was impassable. The crowds were just tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies and police, aided by two sheriff's helicopter crews, began 
stopping the caravans one at time, directing them away from the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 As one deputy directed traffic at Crockett Boulevard and Nadeau Street, just 
south of Huntington Park in the unincorporated area of Walnut Park, he was 
struck by one of the motorists, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy had instructed the motorist to stop, and held on to the vehicle to 
avoid being thrown under its wheels. He managed to roll away from the car when 
the driver swerved away from him, Spear said.

NEW PANEL TO FIGHT BIAS IN MEDIA, JACKSON SAYS; ACTIVISM: CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER 
SAYS GROUP WILL USE EDUCATION AND SOMETIMES BOYCOTTS TO COMBAT WHAT HE CALLS 
EXCLUSION OF MINORITIES FROM HIGH-PROFILE AND POWERFUL POSITIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Institutional racism is rampant in television and newspapers, the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson said Saturday in Los Angeles as he announced formation of a commission 
to do battle with the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbow Commission on Fairness in the Media will use "research, education, 
negotiations and boycotts" to combat prejudice in the media, Jackson said at a 
news conference at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ on South Crenshaw 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will be active in the top 25 advertising market areas in the 
country, and plans to use tactics similar to those employed by Jackson's 
Rainbow Coalition when it recently insisted that organized sports place more 
minorities in positions of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging indictment, Jackson accused the media of presenting negative 
images of nonwhites and of systematically excluding minorities from 
high-profile jobs in television and from positions of authority in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are projected as less intelligent than we are," he said, "less 
hard-working than we work, more violent than we are, less patriotic than we 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson complained that white males fill all the jobs as hosts on Sunday news 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not look like the American public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson also criticized an ABC news promotion picturing an all-white cast of 
commentators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although TV news received the brunt of his criticism, Jackson also found 
newspapers wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of blacks in authority in newsrooms is very low," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper columns and radio talk shows are dominated by "right-of-center" 
males, he said, adding: "And it's not offensive to the ruling powers that be." 
</P>
<P>
 The news media in general has not paid enough attention to such issues as a 
criminal justice system with an inmate population that is mostly black, 
although the majority of those arrested are white, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained of recent cancellations of several television shows that 
featured black stars: "Arsenio," "Roc," "Sinbad" and "South Central" will not 
return next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation among reporters attending the news conference that 
Jackson was in town in connection with the O.J. Simpson murder case. After the 
activist minister completed his condemnation of racism in the media, the first 
question from a reporter dealt with Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you view the coverage of the Simpson case?" asked the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just ignored the substance of what I discussed, using your prerogative to 
determine what would be on the air," Jackson responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of the commission on media fairness was announced after a 
closed-door session attended by 85 people, including ministers, elected 
officials, attorneys and entertainment industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Media experts agreed with some of Jackson's criticism, but said he is ignoring 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one would deny that there is racism in journalism," said Edwin Guthman, 
professor of journalism at USC. "But certainly an enormous amount of progress 
has been made over the last two decades." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Haiman, president of the prestigious Poynter Institute for Media 
Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., reacted similarly. "The press does have a long 
way to go in its portrayal of minorities and the hiring of minorities," he 
said. "My impression, however, is that a good bit of progress is already under 
way."

SOCCER, SCHMOCCER; DESPITE U.S. WIN, MANY STILL BORED AND CONFUSED 
</P>

 It was 5:30 p.m. at Chillers Bar & Grill in Santa Monica. The Nigeria-Bulgaria 
World Cup match was beaming down from overhead TVs. At a table by the door, 
Chris Lehr prepared to explain soccer's offside rule to his old college buddy, 
Kelly Younger. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Lehr said, the Heinz ketchup bottle is the offense and the French's 
Classic Yellow mustard container is the defense. The daiquiri cups are the goal 
posts. The saltshaker is the ball. And the pepper? "The pepper is just hanging 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, a Bulgarian player collapsed in pain on the field. But the game 
continued without a pause. "He's holding his crotch and they won't replace 
him?" Younger asked in amazement. "If that was me, I'd want to leave town." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world beyond the world riveted to the World Cup. As billions of 
people across the planet live and breathe each header and back pass -- and 
scads of Americans perk up their ears in the wake of the U.S. team's stunning 
upset of Colombia on Wednesday -- many Southern Californians remain confounded, 
dumbfounded or just plain uninterested. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer, some say, is boring because of the low scores and what to the 
uninitiated seems like a slow pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing to nothing means nothing to me," said Gayle Green, 95, as he sat at a 
South Pasadena bar, paying scant attention to a match on a nearby screen. "I'd 
watch the Financial News Network before soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are curious why goalkeepers insist on dressing differently than their 
teammates. (In Spider-Man-style suits, for instance.) Or are perplexed by the 
fact that the game doesn't necessarily end when the clock seems to say it 
should. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those who simply can't fathom what keeps players from picking 
up the ball and just flinging it into the darn net. "Why did God give you arms 
and hands," said Westside film editor Richard Boehm, "if you can't use them?" 
</P>

 In staging the planet's premier team sports event in the soccer-stupid States, 
sponsors are hoping that Americans will finally get caught up in World Cup 
fever. But midway through Week 2, evidence persists that, at best, it is a 
low-grade infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the crowd last week at Gus's Bar-B-Q in South Pasadena, a neighborhood 
joint a few miles south of World Cup Ground Zero, otherwise known as the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the startling U.S. victory against Columbia, bar patrons 
craned their heads away from the soccer match toward a second TV to watch the 
introductions, the introductions, of the players for the final game of the NBA 
basketball championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball is much more comprehensible," said banker Steve McIntire, 52. 
"Everything in soccer seems to be random and accidental." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, in the waning moments of the match, Colombia scored to 
narrow the American lead to 2-1. Even then, McIntire and his drinking partner, 
Irwin Zolle, remained unfazed when apprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't basketball, they'll need another hour to score again," McIntire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An hour? They'll need two more weeks," replied Zolle, a financial adviser 
from Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking to raise Cup consciousness, no better selling point could exist 
than the strong U.S. performance. After all, as Gus's manager Vincent Lappas 
puts it: "Americans like sports that they're good at. If they don't win, they 
don't watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet rarely has there been a week less suitable for marketing, with soccer 
having gone head to head with the seesaw New York Knicks-Houston Rockets NBA 
final, and, of course, the non-soccer story of the century, the O.J. Simpson 
saga. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for some national commentators, soccer continues to represent the 
epitome of ennui. CBS talk show host David Letterman joked last week: "I think 
I speak for millions and millions of Americans when I say: Is the World Cup 
over yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about the spoof of America's lack of soccer acumen in the new soft 
drink ad aired before and after World Cup matches? The PowerAde commercial 
features multiple sports star Deion Sanders catching a soccer ball, cradling it 
in his arms, running downfield, and, after a ref waves a yellow penalty card, 
pulling out a pen to autograph it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newly converted, such ribbing may seem sacrilegious. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is you kick the ball into the net," growled actor/action hero Mr. 
T as he watched a match in Legends Sports Bar and Rib Room in Santa Monica. A 
little ignorance doesn't necessarily hurt, he suggested: "I didn't know all the 
rules for football and I had a football scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unquestionably, those monomaniacal soccer fanatics streaming into Old Town 
Pasadena -- the ones sporting strange birthmarks on their cheeks that at second 
glance turn out to be painted flags -- know the rules of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even in their midst, one can find holdouts galore. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance broker Gene Whitlock, a luncheon regular at Dodsworth Bar & Grill, 
admitted that he would rather take a trip to the dentist than to the Rose Bowl. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that if they flew me in on a helicopter that landed on the 
50-yard line and had me sit in an air-conditioned box, I still wouldn't go," 
shouted Whitlock above the din of fans watching a Switzerland-Romania match 
last week. "I suppose I'm interested in the United States. But Cameroon? That 
sounds like a cookie." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street at a cappuccino bar, Pasadena college professor Gary Mraz 
gazed at the passing street spectacle and said: "I'm not interested in sports 
but this is like going to a concert where people dress up to look like Madonna 
or Motley Crue. . . . It's a fascinating cultural experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther down Colorado Boulevard at the staid old Pasadena Cafeteria, soccer 
was the last thing on the mind of attorney Robert Shelley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly don't understand the game and therefore haven't watched," said the 
industrial accident specialist. "I don't know what a free kick is, although at 
least I do know there is such a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar sentiments were echoed last week across the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand why they get so excited," said Juan De Cruz, a marketing 
representative at the Downtown YMCA.  
</P>
<P>
 And on the Westside, film editors Boehm and Barry Zetlin seemed bugged about 
the fashion stylings of goalkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The color has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the team," Boehm said 
while taking a break from cutting an air combat film scene. "Have you noticed 
that? The guy is dressed like Robocop. He has pads and everything. I mean, what 
game is he playing, where's he coming from?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, 'I'm the goalie, I think I'll wear black today,' " Zetlin said. 
"Oh, let's see, today plaid might look nice. Or like we're playing Romania. I 
know they hate red. I'll wear red today. That'll rub them the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are some consolations for the soccer-ignorant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the World Cup was that sailing contest," laughed Younger after his 
impromptu soccer/condiment lesson at Chillers. "But at least the drinks here 
seem to be half price. So there are benefits for those who don't like soccer."

FIGHTER FOR RIGHT TO CHOOSE HAS MADE HER OWN CHOICES; ACTIVISM: DR. CAROLE 
MILLIGAN HASN'T ALWAYS TAKEN THE EASY ROAD. HER ROLE IN ESTABLISHING A PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD CLINIC IS A CASE IN POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Carole Milligan has always made the unexpected choice. 
</P>
<P>
 As a premed graduate from Stanford, she dropped medical school plans to go to 
Kenya with the Peace Corps. As a new mother with a baby still in diapers, she 
enrolled in medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a young radiologist new in town, with a husband running the bank named 
for his great-grandfather, Milligan chose to join Planned Parenthood's push for 
a clinic in Ventura County a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, abortion foes had turned on her, lobbying the Catholic-run St. 
John's Hospital to dismiss her from the staff and picketing the Bank of A. 
Levy, where her then-husband, Michael Milligan, was president. They protested 
daily outside the original Oxnard clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Planned Parenthood of Ventura is hosting a brunch to recognize Milligan 
for the work she did and the obstacles she surmounted. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been a really strong supporter who has been with us since before we 
opened our doors," says Deborah Mason, the group's development coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also a doctor who fills her days caring for cancer patients, then 
spends a weekend riding her bicycle down to San Diego. She has won tennis 
championships at the Pierpont Racquet Club and baked hamburger buns from 
scratch for her daughter's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever meet someone who stops you dead in your tracks?" asks Hope 
Avery, a friend who rides bikes with Milligan. "She has definitely done things 
differently than most women give themselves permission to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan, 49, now divorced, leans forward on the sofa of her spacious Ventura 
beach house as she tries to explain her life. Her 25-year-old daughter 
Kimberley, a law student working this summer for the Women's Legal Defense 
Fund, is an activist dedicated to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Milligan herself wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she meant to leave her career goals behind to do things the easy way, 
she says. She could have settled into the life of a banker's wife, playing 
tennis and rearing her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 She was even taking sewing lessons in an adult-education program. But one day 
in class, she ran into a high school friend. Milligan told her about her premed 
degree from Stanford and her two years in the Peace Corps. She told her about 
the husband she had in law school and the toddler waiting at home. She told her 
how it didn't seem to be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should go to med school," her friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan liked the idea. Her family didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their goals for me primarily had to do with getting a good education so I 
could find a husband," Milligan recalls. "When I decided to go to medical 
school after I was married and had a small child, neither family was exactly 
thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She also found that in the early 1970s, society wasn't quite ready for the 
working woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that child care is an easy thing now," she says, "but there was no 
child care then. There was no day care. Nursery schools went from 9 to 12, 
three days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband filled in helping with the housework and child rearing.  
</P>
<P>
 During her residency, he would bring their daughter to the hospital with a 
pizza and have a family dinner in their Dodge van. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a long adjustment period for me," Milligan says, "knowing I wanted 
a career, knowing I was capable of having a career, but feeling guilty at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
 She overcompensated with her cooking -- making her own jams, pickles, even 
baking hamburgers and hot dog buns from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 She also pursued her athletic interests, playing tennis, hiking, biking and 
camping in California's canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving back to Ventura for her husband's career, Milligan began working 
as a radiologist-oncologist, treating cancer patients first at St. John's and 
later at her own outpatient office in Mission Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very lonely at first," she says. "I did not easily fit into the medical 
social life, being a woman. One of the things that became a real focal point 
for me was Planned Parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allene Craig of Ventura remembers asking Milligan to join the effort to 
establish a family-planning clinic. "We just tried to pick young people who we 
thought would be interested," she said. "I thought she would be a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig was right. Milligan chaired the group's advisory committee for three 
terms. Her volunteer work began influencing her professional life, as angry 
abortion opponents wrote to the St. John's administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hospital administrators and the nuns working there never pressured her 
to drop her work.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were very supportive of me doing what was important to me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her interest in Planned Parenthood, she says, had less to do with abortion 
than with the education the group provides to women. 
</P>
<P>
 The local clinic, now in the city of Ventura, spends barely 5% of its 
resources on abortions, said Deborah Mason, the group's development 
coordinator. The focus is primarily on birth control, gynecological exams and 
counseling women on their options. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, honestly, how I would feel about having an abortion 
personally," Milligan says. "I really think this is a right women should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, Avery, remembers Milligan's advice when Avery and her husband were 
contemplating having a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "All she said, so simply, was, 'The one thing to remember is that we are all 
human. Not having children would be missing out on what it is to be human, the 
human experience,' " Avery recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery now has a 6-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think that once you're involved with Planned Parenthood, you're 
pro-abortion, but that's not it," she says. "It's about choosing."

CHANGE, PROBLEMS COME TO MONTALVO; VENTURA: LONGTIME COMMUNITY RESIDENTS BLAME 
APARTMENT BOOM FOR RISE IN GANGS, DRUGS. OTHERS SAY CRIME WORRIES ARE 
EXAGGERATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sandy Schomaker remembers many things about the Montalvo of the 1960s: the 
scent of the lemon groves on warm summer evenings, bike rides with girlfriends 
to the neighborhood stores, morning walks to Montalvo Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 People didn't lock their doors then, she said. And they didn't worry about 
their kids seeing gangs or people selling drugs at the local shopping center, 
Schomaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bounded by Victoria Avenue to the west, Ralston Street to the north, Johnson 
Drive to the east and the Ventura Freeway to the south, it was a great place to 
grow up, said Schomaker, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she now runs a beauty shop in Montalvo, Schomaker moved out of the 
neighborhood as an adult and has vowed never to come back there to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Montalvo has changed in the past two decades," she said. "It has slowly 
deteriorated." 
</P>
<P>
 Schomaker and other residents and business owners contend that the change 
began in the late 1960s as the city of Ventura pushed eastward, eventually 
gobbling up the hub of Montalvo with new housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 During that housing boom, developers built 35 apartment houses on three 
streets south of the Bristol Shopping Center on Bristol Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively cheap rent in the 6300 blocks of Hummingbird, Whippoorwill and 
Nightingale streets created what Schomaker calls "the ghetto" of Montalvo. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say at least two gangs claim the apartment district as their territory. 
Gang fights, drug dealing and tagging have become common occurrences there and 
at the nearby shopping center, Ventura Police Officer Jim Cubitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rise in petty crime in the apartment area over the past few years prompted 
police in March to open the city of Ventura's first police storefront, said 
Cubitt, who is overseeing the substation. Although bits of Montalvo remain 
unincorporated, the "bird streets," as the apartment district is called, are 
within the city's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Schomaker said the police substation's arrival is just the latest sign that 
Montalvo is changing. What once was a quirky, historic outpost of Ventura -- 
the neighborhood was settled in 1887 -- is slowly being overwhelmed by crime 
and blight, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But one woman who has lived in an apartment on Whippoorwill Street for the 
past seven years bristled at Schomaker's description of her home as 
substandard. Kathy Kohler said some homeowners in the area are snobbish toward 
anyone who rents and are unfairly blaming all of Montalvo's problems on the 
apartment dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the ghetto of Montalvo," said Kohler, 46, a single mother of an 
11-year-old boy. "This is a place to live. These are our homes and we are proud 
to live here." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems with gangs and drugs are "happening everywhere," Kohler said. "It's 
not just a problem for people who rent apartments." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Delgado, 39, agrees with Kohler. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado has lived in an apartment on Hummingbird Street for 14 years. She 
recently opened a produce store at the nearby shopping center in order to 
provide a better life for her husband and four children, Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Jose, works two jobs to help pay the bills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many hard-working families like hers who live in the apartments 
because they can't afford to live somewhere else, Delgado said. And while she 
doesn't deny the existence of crime in her area, Delgado said it is not a bad 
place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working hard and struggling to survive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions about Montalvo seem to be split by how close a resident lives to the 
apartment district. Some residents who live or work near that area think the 
neighborhood is going downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman recently put a for-sale sign up on her Katherine Avenue home, close 
to the Bristol Shopping Center, just months after moving in. People who live in 
the apartments cross her front yard frequently on the way to bus stops and 
stores, and leave trash in her yard, said the woman, who asked to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just have no respect for property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But residents who live just one or two streets removed from the Bristol 
Shopping Center believe Montalvo has not changed much from its peaceful past. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope Conroy, who lives in a home on Greenhill Avenue, said she hasn't noticed 
any increase in crime. And the Police Department's contention that crime is on 
the rise in the area does not intimidate her, said Conroy, a 19-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because there's a bunch of kids sitting around a corner talking doesn't 
mean they are doing anything wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a problem with them. Not once." 
</P>
<P>
 Some are even offended by the presence of the police storefront, saying it is 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Larson, 73, has lived in a home on James Avenue for 43 years with her 
husband, Don. In all those years, Larson said, she has known of only two 
burglaries on her street. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's problems, it must all be over (near the shopping center), because 
it's real quiet here," she said. "I think somebody just blew the crime thing up 
way out of proportion and it irks me. It runs down my neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Montalvo's split personality has a history going back more than a century. In 
1887, administrators at the University of Southern California eyed a grassy 
knoll in the area as the possible site for a "Collegiate Institute," a 
satellite of the more well-known campus in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Montalvo will be the Pasadena of Ventura County!" rhapsodized a local 
newspaper editorialist of the era. But plans for the campus soon fell through. 
Montalvo was then suggested as the site for a county insane asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a bust in the 1880s building boom deflated those plans, and Montalvo 
instead became the area's main railroad depot in the Southern Pacific chain. 
The tiny community grew up around the railroad, with houses to the north and 
warehouses and processing plants to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the residential tracts and industrial sections, Montalvo grew over the 
next 100 years to have its own post office, a church, a restaurant, a motel and 
a school. In two retail centers today, one can find a pet-grooming shop, a 
karate studio and a pizza place. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the houses built on Grand Avenue in the late 1800s are gone; the homes 
that make up the heart of Montalvo today were built in the 1940s and 1950s. 
Many of the homes have wide, spacious lawns, hardwood floors and big back 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Montalvo institution was built in 1959: Loop's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Loop's is a gathering spot for many Montalvo locals. Several residents go to 
the aging coffee shop every day for at least one meal, said owner Wolfgang 
Fritzges. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite of customers is the fake Christmas tree that is up year-round, 
decorated with Polaroid snapshots of the regulars, Fritzges said. Hope Conroy, 
who dines at Loop's two or three times a week, says she likes the chance to 
meet with neighbors and catch up on gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 For Conroy, the time-capsule atmosphere of Loop's represents the real 
Montalvo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's small and people watch out for one another," she said of the 
neighborhood. "It's not like living in L. A. It's a little town in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 4,620 people make up the neighborhood of Montalvo, according to 1990 
census records. About one-fourth of those residents live on unincorporated land 
that is governed by the county instead of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The median household income is $46,602. About 83% of residents 18 years and 
older have graduated from high school, while 15% hold bachelor's degrees, 
census records show. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9% of residents live in poverty, according to the census. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the median household income for Ventura is about $40,000. 
Eighty-four percent of Ventura residents 18 years and older have graduated from 
high school, and 24% have graduated from a four-year college, according to 
census records. 
</P>
<P>
 Montalvo is more mixed racially than Ventura citywide, with 24% Latinos and 
about 9% blacks, Asians, and other ethnicities, census records show. Ventura as 
a whole has 18% Latinos and 5% blacks, Asian and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-eight percent of Montalvo residents are white, compared to 77% in the 
larger city, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite problems, Fritzges said that many residents are proud to live in 
Montalvo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met families who are three or four generations here, who feel very 
attached to the area," he said. "They prefer not to move." 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps that pride that has frustrated several attempts by the city to 
annex the remaining unincorporated bits of Montalvo. Ventura has tried at least 
six times over the past two decades to include all of Montalvo in its 
boundaries, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been hamstrung by an active core of longtime Montalvo residents who 
gather up votes to defeat total annexation, officials have said. The dissenters 
have said they fear their water and sewer rates will go up once they become 
part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritzges, however, has a different theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more of an identity and ego thing," he said. "It's pride in 
their birthplace. Most of them grew up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritzges, who bought Loop's two years ago, knows things are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has been touched himself by a recent increase in petty crime and vandalism. 
About a year ago, his restaurant kept getting hit with graffiti, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a paint bucket ready and if they did it at night, it was gone by the 
morning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, violent crime has not increased in the area over the past few 
years, police say. But police have said the area generates more calls for 
police service than any other in the city of Ventura. Gang fights, domestic 
disputes and drug selling generate the most calls, Cubitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officers who patrol the area believe some crime goes unreported, Cubitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew from people talking that there were drugs and gangs and people were 
becoming fearful," Cubitt said. "There were even unreported shootings at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cubitt said, it would be inaccurate to call Montalvo crime-ridden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take too many bullies to hold a neighborhood hostage," he said. 
"But the area is salvageable." 
</P>
<P>
 The police storefront is scheduled to be open from noon to 9 p.m. daily. 
However, it is sometimes closed during those hours when volunteer staff members 
are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Juan Reynoso and Gregory Hayes are assigned full-time to the 
storefront. They often stay after the office closes, sometimes wearing plain 
clothes, sometimes riding bicycles, always checking out the area, Cubitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corinne Harlan, who has lived in the apartment district for seven years, 
said she has not seen much difference since the police substation arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a gang fight about a month ago, with kids chasing each other down 
the street," said Harlan, a single mother of three. "The police weren't even 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Harlan, 41, said she doesn't like living in her shabby, three-bedroom 
apartment, but it is the only place she can afford right now. She works as a 
clerk at a nearby convenience store to support her family, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She would like to see more police surveillance of the streets, Harlan said. In 
the meantime, she has learned to stay out of trouble over the years and tried 
to teach the same to her children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know who to stay away from and who to make friends with," she said. "I 
don't trust anybody over here." Montalvo at a Glance

AREA AGAIN SIZZLES BUT RELIEF MAY BE ARRIVING; WEATHER: MEANWHILE, THE SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE HEALTH ADVISORY ALERT IN SIMI VALLEY URGES RESIDENTS TO STAY 
INDOORS AND AVOID VIGOROUS ACTIVITY.

 Seeking relief from inland temperatures that soared into the 90s, Ventura 
County residents blanketed the county's beaches Saturday as forecasters 
predicted a gradual easing of the unseasonable hot spell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the east county, air pollution officials issued a health advisory for Simi 
Valley for the second straight day, but pollution levels were expected to 
decline today. 
</P>
<P>
 The health advisory from the Air Pollution Control District -- which followed 
a similar alert Friday -- warned Simi Valley residents to stay indoors and 
avoid vigorous activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory covered only Simi Valley, where the pollutant index for ozone was 
expected to hit 140. But any reading over 100 is considered unhealthful, and 
the ozone level was expected to hit 125 in Ojai, 120 in Thousand Oaks and 
Fillmore, and 100 in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The district office was closed Saturday and actual readings were not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley will probably have lower but still unhealthy levels of smog today, 
officials said, while air quality in other parts of the county returns to the 
moderate range. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the cooler temperatures and improved air quality that forecasters 
predicted were attributed to a stronger onshore flow of ocean breezes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is about as warm as it's going to get," said meteorologist Jay 
Stockton of the National Weather Service on Saturday. Highs Saturday ranged 
from 77 in Ventura to 96 in Ojai. The mercury hit 91 in Thousand Oaks and it 
was believed to be even hotter in Simi Valley, though no official figure was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton predicted that today's temperatures will be in the mid to upper 80s 
in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, while Ventura and Oxnard will again see 
temperatures in the upper 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's heat drew more than 100 swimmers to the pool at Rancho Simi 
Community Park, said Bryan McQueen, the weekend manager of the park. "It's 
really hot. I'm going to jump in the water myself pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of east county residents drove to the Simi pool to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to bring her out to experience the plunge," said Moorpark resident 
Michael Kenealy, guiding his 3-year-old daughter through the water. Kenealy 
said he was unaware of the unhealthful air hanging over the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really noticed," he said. "Maybe we're just becoming used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Erika Filippeloi said her body tells her when the ozone is bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sinuses start running like crazy and my eyes run," she said, pulling a wad 
of Kleenex from her pocket. The Simi Valley resident brought her five children 
to the pool to chill out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguard Nicole Fava said the smog was so bad she could smell it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smells like the back of a bus," she said, scrunching her nose and 
frowning. "When I was driving to Northridge last night I could see it." 
</P>
<P>
 The unhealthy pollution level caught some outdoor enthusiasts unaware. Tennis 
diehards Andy Smith and Ed Roberts scampered across the courts at Rancho Simi 
Community Park, unaware of the health advisory warning them not to partake in 
vigorous exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just commented on how it felt a little smoggy," Smith said, taking a large 
gulp of water during a break in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought I was getting old," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unhealthful conditions, the Simi Valley residents said they 
planned to go on with their game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we're going to play some more," Roberts said. "Just get the paramedics 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Many escaped the smog by heading to the coast. More than 4,000 people lined 
the sands of San Buenaventura State Beach, lifeguards said, and more were 
expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see why you wouldn't want to come out here," lifeguard supervisor 
Kirk Sturm said. "It's a beautiful sunny day. Not too windy, clean air and cool 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Cars lined roadsides up and down the coast as people staked out their favorite 
piece of beachside property. Steve and Dierdre Ray of Oxnard spread out their 
towels at Oxnard's Mandalay Beach with their two young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this beach," a very tan Dierdre Ray said. "It's clean and not too 
crowded. We come here all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 While their 6-year-old daughter, Farren, played in the surf on her boogey 
board and 2-year-old Lauren played on a nearby swing set, the couple sat and 
chatted with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the beach, dotted with sun worshippers, Don Gandy was reeling in his 
10-year-old son Travis' rainbow-colored kite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come out here every time we can," Gandy said. "It gets a little crowded 
when it gets hot like this, but that's OK."

SIMPSON CASE SETS OFF DOMESTIC ABUSE ALARM; SAFETY: CALLS FOR HELP ARE 
INCREASING OMINOUSLY. COUNSELORS AND POLICE SAY CURRENT MEDIA ATTENTION WILL 
FOCUS CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In January, a 15-year-old Oxnard boy allegedly killed his mother's boyfriend 
to stop him from beating her. In February, a Moorpark woman was shot and killed 
two days after divorcing her husband. In April, an Oxnard man allegedly shot 
his wife after an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the wake of the slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman 
and the arrest of mega-star O.J. Simpson, public attention has focused on the 
issue of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the counselors and volunteers who have spent decades trying to root 
out one of this county's pervasive social ills welcome the spotlight, they also 
mean to remind everyone that domestic violence is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can name five people right here in Ventura County who are not as famous as 
Nicole Simpson, but they are just as dead," said Jamie Leigh, executive 
director of the Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people still don't realize the severity of this problem," she said. 
"But you can be sure we will take advantage of this attention to let people 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have followed domestic violence cases in Ventura County point to a 
yearly rise in calls for help as proof of the crisis and residents' increasing 
recognition of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year, as people become more aware of this problem, we get a better 
picture of how bad things are here," said Marty Bolton, director of crisis 
services for Interface Children, Family Services of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five years, calls have doubled to the Interface hot line, one 
of two in the county taking domestic violence complaints. In the year ending 
June 30, 1989, the hot line received 518 calls; so far in the current period, 
it has received 1,020 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, officials at Interface said, the media focus on domestic 
violence has prompted a 40% increase in calls to the hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Simpson case has had an incredible impact," Bolton said. "We've 
had people who have called and said that they've heard all of the same things 
that Nicole Simpson heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the slayings. However, he was convicted in 
1989 of beating Nicole Simpson, who was then his wife, and was placed on 
probation. But on at least two other occasions -- in 1985 and 1993 -- police 
were called to Nicole Simpson's home on a spousal battery complaint that she 
later declined to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with local incidents of alleged domestic violence call it a 
textbook case. 
</P>
<P>
 Spousal abuse, Leigh said, occurs in three stages. In the first stage, the 
woman walks on pins and needles to avoid triggering an argument. If she acts 
perfectly, she believes, she can avoid a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second stage, Leigh said, the man's steadily building anger erupts, 
either as vicious verbal abuse, damage to property or physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh calls the third stage "the honeymoon," when the husband apologizes and 
showers his wife with gifts. At that point, both are convinced the violence 
will never occur again. But, Leigh said, it almost always does -- resuming the 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at what occurred in O.J. Simpson's case -- the police calls to 
the house, O.J.'s destruction of her property, even the suicide note -- 
absolutely everything is classic," Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it surprising, Leigh said, that the public has long viewed Simpson as a 
charming figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the very common characteristics of a batterer to have this 
discrepancy between his public and private life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the reasons the women often find it so difficult to come forward. 
They think that because everyone likes their husband, no one will believe her." 
</P>
<P>
 What was most dismaying about the Simpson case, Leigh said, was that even 
though Nicole Simpson called police and pressed charges at least once, the 
system apparently failed her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message O.J. got from the court was that (the abuse) was not that 
serious," she said. "The message was that he was a special person and he could 
get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials in Ventura County said they believe there are enough 
safeguards to prevent the same result from occurring here. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Assistant Police Chief Tom Cady, who helped develop the county's 
recently adopted uniform plan for responding to domestic incidents, said the 
system is set up to convict offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers in Oxnard, where about 1,200 domestic violence calls were received 
last year, respond to every domestic call with tape recorders and cameras so 
they can document the abuse if the woman changes her mind about pressing 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, officers are in close contact with abuse-prevention groups, which 
provide shelters for women. Police also carry the number for a hot line to 
counsel men and to help them cool down. In addition, a new state law, which 
will go into effect in July, imposes harsher penalties for people convicted of 
spousal battery, including required group counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officers on the street said they don't see the problem going away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Domestic calls are very frustrating for us," said Officer Juan Reynoso, who 
works a neighborhood patrol in the Montalvo section of Ventura. "We've gained a 
lot of ground in the past few years in terms of how we handle the cases, but 
you can only do so much." 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, Reynoso said, police respond to several domestic calls a night. 
Often, they return again and again to the same houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one woman in Ventura that we used to see every single week," 
Reynoso said. "Every week he would berate her, and then she would convince him 
to leave. But somehow, he always ended up coming back. At one point she had a 
restraining order. But then she let him come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night she called after he had trashed their entire house," Reynoso 
recalled. "She came up to me and said, 'I think he could have killed me.' And I 
said to her: 'That's what we've been trying to tell you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Increased vigilance by police and prosecutors would help, Leigh said. But also 
needed, she said, is more education and counseling for abusers and their 
victims to break patterns of household violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Leigh's organization and Interface provide shelter and counseling for 
abuse victims as well as help for batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are almost always at the receiving end of household violence, officials 
said. Of the more than 200 spouse abusers being counseled by Interface, fewer 
than five are women, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 One hot line operator in Thousand Oaks said he believes the added publicity 
stemming from the Simpson case can only help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that with everything that's been happening, people are finally 
realizing that we need to take domestic violence seriously," said Carlos 
Zaragosa, who answers hot line calls on weekends for Interface. "I think it's 
opened people's eyes." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Two 24-hour hot lines offer information about shelters, counseling and other 
services available to victims or perpetrators of domestic violence: Interface, 
at 1-800-339-9597, and the Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence hot 
line, at (805) 656-1111. Domestic Violence in Ventura County

HAMS HAVE A FIELD DAY ON RASNOW PEAK; HOBBIES: THE CONEJO VALLEY AMATEUR RADIO 
CLUB SETS THE CONTROLS FOR A LONG-DISTANCE COMMUNICATION CONTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The scratchy noise emitting from the small black scanner was unintelligible to 
the average person's ear. But to the radio wizards gathered atop Rasnow Peak on 
Saturday, it was music. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 30 or so members of the Conejo Valley Amateur Radio Club perched on 
the Newbury Park hilltop, the muffled voice represented a point in a 24-hour 
contest, ending today at 11 a.m., that tests the skills of radio operators 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has won the event for the last four years -- to the bewilderment of 
some members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why, it's kind of a kick-back operation," said Thousand Oaks 
resident Don Munding, tapping a Morse code message from the shelter of his 
parked van. 
</P>
<P>
 Munding's vehicle was one of 15 stations atop the hill where amateur radio 
buffs -- or hams, as they call one another -- were tapping, calling and typing 
messages to other hams participating in the radio relay exercise. Each time a 
member connected with a distant radio operator -- in, say, Texas, Florida or 
Germany -- the club scored a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the eclectic assortment of tents, truck beds and flimsy awnings, 
members sported a sophisticated collection of high-tech equipment for the 
marathon event, including personal computers, antennas and satellite dishes -- 
each transmitting a mere five watts of battery-operated power. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Ventura County ham groups participated in the 24-hour field day as well. 
Clubs from Ventura, Point Mugu and Camarillo set up camp at Point Mugu, while 
an Ojai group transmitted from Dennison Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being a worldwide contest, the field day provides an 
opportunity for hams to practice radio communications in a simulated emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really tests your mettle," said club President Eddie Pierce, known among 
hams as WB6DFW, his radio call sign. "It's preparing everybody for emergency 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the group was operating from a disaster site -- the burned-out lot 
where Hank Rasnow's home was destroyed in last fall's Green Meadow fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting under a canopy in the spot that was once Rasnow's pool, UCLA student 
Gerry Dong talked about how he used a ham radio to help the Los Angeles Police 
Department in the days following January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the LAPD needed help with field operations, we helped for a few days," 
he said. Other Conejo Valley club members helped with communications in the 
aftermath of the disaster as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Ham radio operators are trained to transmit communications on various 
frequencies during emergencies, Dong explained, enabling them to send and 
receive messages when standard communication systems are jammed or fail. And 
the hobby has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the older days, Morse code was the form preferred," Pierce said. "But now 
digital operations are the form preferred." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiding from the midday sun in their tent, Norm Campbell and Memo Hernandez 
tried to contact other radio buffs using a laptop computer to message. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like E-mail," Hernandez explained, moving the cursor along a list of 
random call signs displayed on the monitor. "Instead of using a microphone or a 
key, we use a computer." 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards away, hams were sending messages to other hams via satellite. 
Using a computer tracking system, the operators followed the pattern of passing 
U.S. and Russian satellites. When one appeared over Ventura County, the hams 
transmitted a voice message to space. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Camarillo ham Hugh Wilcox said, when the satellite passed over again, 
they expected to hear the message transmitting back from space. Using this 
high-tech method, the radio operators hoped to contact distant locales such as 
Germany, Australia and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime ham Munding wants nothing to do with satellites or computers. He 
prefers to communicate the old-fashioned way -- by Morse code. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get hoarse talking on the microphone," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 20 years that he has been clicking signals, Munding has tapped into 
some remote locations. "One time it was a Russian South Pole expedition," he 
said. "That was the farthest." 
</P>
<P>
 Munding said Conejo Valley's enterprising hams are a mixed group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nerds, geeks, dorks, wimps," he said. "People from all walks of 
life." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Amateur Radio Club has about 100 members, but anyone 
interested in joining or learning about radio communications is welcome. For 
information, write the club at P.O. Box 2093, Thousand Oaks 91358, or call 
372-7550.

BLISS IS RELATIVE FOR CANYON CLAN; FAMILY: THE GILLIBRANDS HAVE DOMINATED THE 
CANYON ABOVE SIMI FOR GENERATIONS. IT'S 'PARADISE,' AND THEY ARE THERE TO STAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five years ago, when Juanita Brooks began planning a massive family reunion at 
her home in Gillibrand Canyon above Simi Valley, the third-generation Ventura 
County resident mailed hundreds of invitations to far-flung relatives around 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens more family members were easier to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, 59, simply strolled along the curving road that cuts through the 
canyon named after her pioneering grandfather, knocking on the doors of her 
cousins, nieces, nephews and children to alert them of the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all lived up here all our lives," Brooks said. "There's a beauty and a 
peace here that keeps us here, makes us realize that there's no reason to go 
anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed the sleepy, shaded canyon four miles north of Simi Valley up Tapo 
Canyon Road is a tiny pocket of rural life locked in a time warp, far from the 
strip malls and sprawling housing tracts that make up much of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the Gillibrands ride horses, bale hay, walk barefoot down dusty roads 
and cross each other's unfenced lawns, passing through unlocked doors for 
shared meals and reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of some 20-odd homes lining the canyon, about 15 belong to Gillibrand 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid and I tried to spend the night at friends' houses in Simi 
Valley, I would always have to leave because I felt claustrophobic," said 
Melissa Brooks, 39, Juanita Brooks' daughter. "Here you feel open and free and 
safe, and you're surrounded by people you love." 
</P>
<P>
 From one home to the next, evidence of the Gillibrand genes abounds in the 
tall, athletic builds, the large cornflower-blue eyes, the honey-brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all grew up together so there's a sense of stability and security," said 
Harlene Holeman, 48, a cousin of Brooks'. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Holeman's house crumbled in the Jan. 17 earthquake, she found refuge next 
door with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all got this incredibly strong sense of community and history," Holeman 
said. "All we have to do is go down to Simi Valley or Los Angeles to see how 
lucky we are." 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of Gillibrand Canyon began with a case of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Leyland Gillibrand, Brooks' grandmother, was diagnosed with the illness 
in 1886, spurring her husband, Edward Clayton Gillibrand, to shut down his 
silk-spinning shop in Manchester, England, to seek a healthier clime. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by the promise of adventure and cheap land in the American West, he 
quickly decided to try his luck as a California cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gillibrands sailed into Port Hueneme and headed for the hills, settling on 
6,000 acres of prime grazing land north of what is now Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after their arrival, Edward Gillibrand made a surprising and lucrative 
discovery: His land was situated on a 12-million-year-old mound of oyster and 
scallop shells, the largest known deposit of its kind in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The family quickly set about mining the fossilized shells, whose pure calcium 
content is valued for use in flour, medicine and chicken feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ellen Gillibrand furnished the family ranch house with fine English 
linens and silks and filled a formal English garden with fragrant, colorful 
blooms and a flock of peacocks. 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, the cattle are gone, as are most of the shells. The family 
property has shrunk to about 1,000 acres, and the old Gillibrand house is just 
a memory. Having deteriorated over the years, it finally succumbed to the 
recent earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All that remains of the elegant garden are several dozen peacocks, who spend 
their days sunning near the empty, quake-cracked swimming pool and perching in 
the low branches of centuries-old oaks. Their screeches echo through the quiet 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes, the land continues to provide housing and employment for 
the Gillibrand clan. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks and her husband, Charles, breed and train Peruvian Paso Fino horses, 
selling them for $1,500 to $40,000 apiece. They also run Tapo Rock and Sand, 
one of two family-owned rock quarries based in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 - The other, larger, operation -- P.W. Gillibrand Co. -- is run by Brooks' 
brother Phil and includes titanium mines in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members who work outside the canyon say leaving each day makes them 
appreciate coming home even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a refuge," said Debbie Sandland, 40, a Gillibrand grandchild who 
serves on the Simi Valley school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, David Sandland, 40, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived all over the place, but this is the best place I've ever lived," 
he said. "Just a few miles away, you've got all the freeways and shopping 
centers you could ever want. Then you come up here and it's paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise is not without its problems. The dry hillsides keep the Gillibrands 
on constant watch for brush fires. Juanita Brooks has witnessed 10 especially 
destructive fires in her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping I won't see any more, but that would almost be a miracle," Brooks 
said. "It's just a fact of life when you live somewhere so dry and windy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 17 brought another reminder of nature's mighty force, when the Northridge 
earthquake roared through the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake sent truck-sized boulders crashing down the canyon walls, smothering 
three corrals, two barns and a shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mess," Brooks said. "The cleanup is going to go on for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' granddaughter, 13-year-old Ashley, has another concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like being so far away from everything," she said. "My friends who 
live in Simi Valley can just walk to shops, but when my mom's busy and my 
grandma's working, I have no ride." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, Ashley said she enjoys canyon life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my own horse, and it's worth it for that," she said. "I also like 
being so close to my grandmother and having so much space." 
</P>
<P>
 In that space are many relics from the past, including an old family cemetery 
-- one of the few remaining private graveyards in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Used to be lots of people had private cemeteries," Brooks said. "But land got 
too valuable, so folks dug up the bodies and sold the land." 
</P>
<P>
 The marble headstones and withered bouquets all memorialize Gillibrand 
relations, save one -- a child buried at the site in 1889 is remembered on the 
marker simply as "Our Neighbor's Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Gillibrands clearly dominate the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Torgerson, 64, who has lived at the foot of the canyon for 16 years, 
is not related to the Gillibrands, nor does her family associate much with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of contact is not a problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of the beauty of the place," Torgerson said. "There's room enough 
for everyone."

<P>
 Name Changes--What's in a name? Plenty, for serious bird-watchers. The 
following bird names have been changed recently by the American Ornithological 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The green-backed heron is now the green heron and the black-shouldered kite is 
now the white-tailed kite. The lesser golden-plover was split into two species: 
American golden-plover (Pluvialis dominica) and Pacific golden-plover 
(Pluvialis fulva). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the rosy finch was split into three species: gray-crown rosy finch

CHURCHGOERS JOIN IN MASSIVE CHRISTIAN PRAYER EVENT; RELIGION: LOCAL 
PARTICIPANTS IN 'MARCH FOR JESUS,' WHICH ORIGINATED IN EUROPE, CARRY BALLOONS 
AND BANNERS AS THEY TREK IN 92-DEGREE HEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 About 1,000 people from churches throughout Saddleback Valley on Saturday 
joined a two-mile "March for Jesus," part of a worldwide Christian evangelical 
event that this year spanned more than 500 U.S. cities and 170 countries 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants carried balloons and "praise Jesus" banners as they trekked 
in 92-degree heat through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Lickel, a Harvard University student home on summer break, wore a Mexican 
sombrero to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people out there that march for other things and when people 
get together and march for something spiritual, it's great," said Lickel, 20, 
of Mission Viejo. "We're not some nutsos." 
</P>
<P>
 The march was one of three such gatherings in Orange County Saturday, which 
included an estimated 2,000 people at separate events in Irvine and Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said that "March for Jesus" is a massive prayer event designed to 
spread Christianity in the "least evangelized areas" of the world. It 
originated in Europe in the mid-1980s and spread to other countries in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Ann Mayfield, the Saddleback march coordinator, said that more than 10 
million people participated worldwide last year and even more were expected 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's hourlong progression began and ended at Saddleback Community Church 
in a giant white tent, where marchers gathered afterward to pray for the United 
States, Japan and the local community, Mayfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stand up for what we believe," said Duy Pham, pastor of Mission Viejo 
Southern Baptist Church, which has an all-Vietnamese congregation.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
ASSEMBLYMAN'S FAITH IN VOTERS' INCORRUPTIBILITY SPOKEN WITH CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing by His Man: Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) freely admits to 
being filled with sorrow over the recent conviction of longtime friend Sen. 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier) in the Capitol corruption trial in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, whose district includes a wide swath of South County, said he still 
believes in Hill's innocence and that the jury's decision "seemed more a 
verdict on the system." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morrow's opponents in the November election may see the friendship as a 
political liability. Hill helped bankroll Morrow's 1992 election, loaning him 
$96,000. In turn, Morrow this year gave Hill $20,000 for his reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman is confident that voters won't castigate him for remaining 
loyal to his pal from college days. "The voters are savvy enough and fair 
enough to realize that someone isn't guilty by association," Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his opponents would be "taking it far afield to suggest Frank's 
loans were somehow tainted. If that were so, the FBI would be asking me a lot 
of questions, and that hasn't been the case." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brown Out?: Some local Republicans claim the 69th Assembly District seat being 
given up by Democrat Tom Umberg of Garden Grove is prime for a GOP takeover, 
partly because Assembly Speaker Willie Brown needs to direct party money to 
other Assembly seats where officeholders are in danger of losing their jobs. If 
so, according to the premise, Michael Metzler, Democratic nominee in the 69th 
District, would be largely on his own to defend the only local legislative post 
held by a Democrat. (Republicans regularly use Brown's photo in local campaign 
mailers to whip up support for their candidates.) 
</P>
<P>
 "They're nuts," the Speaker said recently. "You have to defend seats that are 
already Democratic." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also made it clear that the amount of state Democratic Party money to 
Metzler's campaign will largely depend on how much Metzler raises on his own. 
"If Mr. Metzler runs as hard as Mr. Umberg ran, I am sure that the support from 
outside of the district will be equal to what it was for Mr. Umberg," Brown 
said. 
</P>

 Half Full or Half Empty: A recent Orange County fund-raiser for the Democrats' 
statewide slate raised $50,000 "and still counting," said one party official, 
who claimed the event "was a good outing in Orange County." But the total was 
far short of the $100,000 party leaders had hoped to take in from the event 
held in San Juan Capistrano on June 18. Beforehand, party leaders had promised 
that half of the proceeds would remain in central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar Politics: A 1988 political fund-raiser at the Disneyland Hotel -- 
jointly benefiting former Rep. Jack Kemp's presidential campaign and 
then-Orange County Rep. William E. Dannemeyer -- was included in a long list of 
campaign finance violations committed by Kemp, according to a Federal Elections 
Commission report released recently. The result was the largest penalties ever 
assessed by the FEC, with Kemp agreeing to pay $120,000 in penalties and refund 
$111,000 to contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, who lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, said he never 
even knew the FEC had questioned the joint fund-raiser. He said he strives "to 
comply precisely with the requirements of federal fund-raising laws. In my 
years in public life, I have escaped the clutches of the Federal Elections 
Commission."

<P>
 Debate Anyone? Claiming that Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) has not 
taken a position on the November ballot advisory measure calling for a 
commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, Cox's Democratic 
opponent, Gary Kingsbury, instead challenged Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) to debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said Kingsbury is wrong. Cox said he has repeatedly stated his opposition 
to the measure, because he believes the 4,700-acre base should be sold to the 
highest bidder without any preconditions on how it should be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury, who also opposes the ballot initiative, said he wants to debate 
Rohrabacher because the Huntington Beach congressman has made passage of the 
measure his "No. 1 priority," even though the base is in Cox's district. 
</P>
<P>

 White House Call: Democrat Robert J. Banuelos, who plans to mount a write-in 
campaign in the 46th Congressional District after finishing second in the June 
7 primary, complains that local Democratic leaders didn't take him seriously in 
1992 when he was the party nominee and received 41% of the vote against the 
incumbent, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 But a White House political affairs staffer thought Banuelos was serious 
enough to warrant a visit last weekend. Banuelos narrowly lost to businessman 
Mike Farber earlier this month, even though Farber outspent Banuelos by 
45-to-1. "I was really impressed by his grass-roots efforts. . . . We know that 
he came real close to winning (the primary) and that he had little financial 
resources," said White House emissary Joe Velasquez, adding that he tried to 
encourage Banuelos to support Farber. "The Latino community is very important 
to us."

 For Pete's Sake: At the Republican-dominated county Board of Supervisors, the 
mere mention of Gov. Pete Wilson's Democratic challenger brings a cold shudder 
that recently and briefly froze County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
During a discussion of ways that the county could be affected by state 
government's financial situation, Schneider mentioned you know who as another 
factor to consider should you know who be elected in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me?" Supervisor Roger R. Stanton reacted in apparent disbelief. "What 
was that?" Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez chimed in. For the remainder of the 
discussion, Kathleen Brown's name was not uttered again.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; FIRE MEMORIES SPUR DONATIONS FOR COPTERS 
</P>

<P>
 A Newbury Park company whose employees' homes were threatened by last year's 
Green Meadow fire has agreed to donate parts and mechanical help to maintain 
the county's helicopter fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of us watched as the county's helicopters dropped water on the fires 
that were burning all around our homes," said Mike Conway, chairman of PTI 
Technologies Inc. "We just felt like this would be a good way to show our 
gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's three helicopters worked nearly nonstop dropping water on the 
blaze, which consumed 40,000 acres around Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is also responsible for rescues performed in the county almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "These aircraft get to see a lot of activity, and it's expensive to keep them 
up and running," said John Davitz, chief of maintenance for the Ventura County 
sheriff's air unit. "We really appreciate the help that these guys have 
offered." 
</P>
<P>
 PTI, which manufactures filters for the helicopters, donated about $6,000 
worth of equipment, and offered to help the department's three-person 
maintenance crew with repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have asked other companies in the area to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all realized how important the helicopters were when we were at 
risk of losing our homes," said Rick Esler, an engineer at PTI who lives in 
Newbury Park. "I would like to see a lot of companies looking for ways that 
they can give something back." MATTHEW MOSK

TRIPLE TRAGEDY ROCKS POPULAR SKI RESORT; VAIL: ARRESTS OF THREE KEY CITY 
OFFICIALS HIT RESIDENTS HARD.

<BYLINE>

<P>
 Things used to work so well in America's top-rated and most popular ski resort 
that the constant battle for parking was the talk of the town of 3,800. Now, 
talk focuses on more serious matters: 
</P>
<P>
 * Safety Manager Mary Lawrence was charged with vehicular homicide in the 
death of a 2-year-old girl run down in a stroller in September. Police allege 
Lawrence was stoned on cocaine. The victim's family has filed a $10-million 
lawsuit against the town. 
</P>
<P>
 * Town Attorney Tom Moorhead was arrested April 2 on charges of driving under 
the influence and careless driving after he wrecked the $28,998 Saab assigned 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
 * The town's personnel manager, Bob Mach, was arrested May 30 on murder 
charges in the shooting of his wife, Mimi. (The couple earlier were charged 
with child abuse after leaving their 11-year-old daughter home alone while they 
took a four-day business trip to Montana.) Mach was charged with first-degree 
murder and was held without bail at Eagle County Jail in Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the privately owned ski area hasn't escaped trouble. One of its employees 
was killed in February after he jumped off the edge of a road while skiing, 
slamming into a British tourist and seriously injuring her. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has not been a very pleasant year for the town," town Manager Bob 
McLaurin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent hours talking with members of the city's 205 full-time staff 
members "just to make sure everyone here is OK." Counseling was offered, though 
McLaurin said morale remained good. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just an unrelated series of unfortunate events. We can't hide that. 
We're not trying to hide it. We're trying to deal with it. We'll come out of 
this even stronger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Kittay, an outspoken critic of the town government, remarked that the town 
fortunately is building a police station right next to the administration 
building: "They can move them from the administrative office right into jail." 
</P>
<P>
 He called it a scandal that all three town officials remained on the payroll 
after being charged. All three pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaye Steinke, manager of the Vail Athletic Club, said, "It's almost like their 
alleged crimes match their jobs. I mean, the safety director. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinke sees it as just a coincidence, "but it doesn't reflect well on Vail. I 
just hope they face up to the charges and don't try to hide behind their 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Police Chief Ken Hughey: "My gut feeling is now that the initial shock is 
over people are getting on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that everyone is probably shaken by the number of tragedies we have 
had," Mayor Peggy Osterfoss said. "All of us live in an upbeat place where 
positive things go on and, well, tragedy seems distant."

 A board that distributes state money to homeless shelters will meet Mondayto 
discuss how to spend a recently received $100,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Emergency Housing and Assistance Program board have put 
together a draft plan for allocating the money to help existing charities 
update their shelters.The board is made up of representatives of county 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now what we are hoping to do is get some public input so we can see what 
other people think about this plan," said Beverly Viola, a spokeswoman for 
United Way. "We've listed our priorities, but this is public money, so we need 
to be sure that the public agrees with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Viola invited those interested in commenting to call her at 485-6288 for a 
copy of the draft proposal. The public hearing will be held 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. 
Monday at the United Way's Ventura County office, 1339 Del Norte Road in 
Camarillo. MATTHEW MOSK

 Developers hoping to build in Ventura will have a chance to present their 
projects to city leaders at a special joint session of the City Council and 
Planning Commission on July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours of debate, council members and planning commissioners agreed 
Tuesday to hold another joint meeting to hear the builders' proposals before 
the council awards housing allocations at the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, bound by local and federal standards for air pollution and growth 
control, can allow 1,018 houses, condominiums or apartments built through 1999. 
However, in 1994 alone, developers are seeking to build more than 3,000 housing 
units in the city. CONSTANCE SOMMER

<P>
 A 3-year-old Piru boy was in good and stable condition Saturday after being 
bitten on the foot by a rattlesnake in the driveway of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Ciseners was in the intensive care unit at Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 9 p.m. Friday, the toddler tried to pick up a foot-long rattler 
that was stretched out in the driveway of his family's home on Main Street in 
Piru. The snake bit him on the inside of his left foot, Ventura County fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he thought it was a lizard," Capt. Elliot Handy said. "He picked up 
this rattlesnake and it bit him in the foot. It was fairly serious." The leg 
swelled considerably, Handy said, before the boy was transported to the 
hospital. Firefighters killed the small snake. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 Wardens for the California Department of Fish and Game believe a black bear 
found shot near Lions Campground was killed by poachers who cut off the 
animal's paws and cut out its gall bladder for sale on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 Captain Roger Reese of the Department of Fish and Game said that poachers sell 
the claws for jewelry and the gall bladders for use as an aphrodisiac.He said 
that much of the contraband is smuggled to Asian countries and can fetch many 
thousands of dollars.

 "There's been a lot of publicity about how valuable these items are," Reese 
said. "In this case, the bear could have been killed by one person and then 
another could have cut it up, but we suspect the person that poached the animal 
also removed the claws and gall bladder." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said this would be the first recorded poaching case in the county where 
a bear was killed just for its body parts. He said the bear was a 300-pound 
female, which was shot very close to the campground near Sespe Creek earlier in 
the week. The case is still under investigation, Reese said. SCOTT HADLY

LOWELL MARKS 100 YEARS OF SEARCHING THE STARS; ARIZONA: OBSERVATORY'S FOUNDER 
SOUGHT TO PROVE THAT LIFE EXISTED ON MARS. HE FAILED, BUT COLLEAGUES AT 
FLAGSTAFF DID DISCOVER THE PLANET PLUTO AND FOUND THE FIRST CLUE THAT THE 
UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Percival Lowell, wealthy scion of a Massachusetts textile family, was obsessed 
with Mars: He sought to prove that life existed on the Red Planet. 
</P>
<P>
 So he dispatched a Harvard astronomer on a hasty rail tour to scour the 
Arizona Territory for a telescope site. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell ultimately failed in his quest. But, 100 years after he first peered 
through a telescope from Mars Hill in Flagstaff on May 28, 1894, the 
observatory he founded is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from Lowell Observatory in the early part of the century that 
astronomers discovered the planet Pluto and gleaned the first clue that the 
universe is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The observatory, small by today's standards and not part of any university, 
continues its scientific role. It seeks out comets and asteroids, studies the 
planets and assesses the sun's long-term future and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a long and distinguished history in making contributions, 
particularly in planetary sciences, and they continue to do so," said Richard 
Green, director of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, including Kitt 
Peak near Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The observatory marked its centennial by opening a $2.5-million interactive 
visitor center that will attract some of the thousands of people who pass 
through Flagstaff, 140 miles north of Phoenix, on their way to the Grand 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The observatory is alive and well and pursuing astronomy at the forefront of 
what's being done," said Edward Bowell, a staff astronomer and noted asteroid 
hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowell and astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker head an effort to detect 
potentially lethal chunks of ice and rock hurtling through space. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among the most prolific patrollers in the world: Bowell has 
discovered and named more than 300 asteroids, and Carolyn Shoemaker has found 
more than 300 asteroids and 30 comets. 
</P>
<P>
 They troll for killer comets and asteroids, like Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which 
is expected to plunge into Jupiter on July 16 at 134,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker-Levy 9's collision with Jupiter will unleash a blast conservatively 
estimated at 1 million megatons, 200 times the explosive power of the world's 
entire nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell, with 16 astronomers with doctorates, has stayed in the game partly by 
upgrading older, undersized equipment in an era when instruments are constantly 
getting bigger and more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important has been the use of extremely sensitive, digital computer 
cameras that improve the performance of existing telescopes, according to 
Lowell director Robert Millis, co-discoverer in 1977 of rings around Uranus and 
in 1988 of Pluto's hazy atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 These devices allow an instrument the size of the 72-inch Perkins telescope, 
the largest at Lowell, to operate as well as the 200-inch Hale telescope on 
California's Mt. Palomar did before its operation, too, was improved in the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual budget of about $2.5 million, Lowell operates four small 
telescopes at Mars Hill, elevation 7,200 feet, and has five more instruments 
operating or planned on 7,200-foot Anderson Mesa south of Flagstaff and one in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Anderson Mesa are the Perkins scope, owned by Ohio State and Ohio Wesleyan 
universities, the 42-inch John S. Hall telescope, a 31-inch reflecting 
telescope, a $17-million instrument under construction called the Navy 
Prototype Optical Interferometer and a wide-field telescope recently 
refurbished and moved from Ohio to study approaching comets and asteroids. 
</P>
<P>
 The interferometer, to be operated in collaboration with the Naval Research 
Laboratory and the U.S. Naval Observatory, will use six 20-inch mirrors acting 
in concert to produce images 100 times sharper than conventional ground 
telescopes, Millis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell, the world's largest privately owned institution of its kind, reflects 
the course charted by its independent, charismatic founder. Percival Lowell, 
who died in 1916, stipulated in its endowment that it could not become 
subsidiary to any educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1948, research languished, since the observatory existed solely on 
interest from its endowment. Then trustee Roger Lowell Putnam sought other 
funding and landed a contract with the National Weather Service for a project 
to study the sun's stability that continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 The observatory was born out of Lowell's fascination with the work of Italian 
astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, who described lines on Mars' surface as 
"canali." The word literally means "grooves," but was mistakenly translated 
into English as "canals." 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1894, Lowell sent Harvard-trained astronomer A. E. Douglass to 
Arizona to scout a site from which to observe Mars. In six weeks, Douglass 
ruled out Tombstone, Tucson, Tempe and Prescott and settled on "Site 11," west 
of Flagstaff. Five weeks later, he had a wooden dome built for Lowell's two 
borrowed telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell, a widely traveled Harvard intellectual, theorized that Schiaparelli's 
canali were farm irrigation systems. Lowell wrote three books about Mars, 
though professional astronomers rejected his views. 
</P>
<P>
 But later work at the observatory won acclaim.

FESTIVAL CATERS TO DIVERSE TASTES IN CUISINE, MUSIC AND COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of people turned out Saturday for the "Taste of Orange County" to 
sample cuisine from 36 different restaurants, listen to live music and pick up 
cooking tips from top local chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 But two Lake Forest women came for just one thing -- the opportunity to 
splurge."We just finished the Jenny Craig program and we've been eating ever 
since," said 53-year-old Martha Yuhnke. "At this moment, we can't get enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The two friends arrived at noon as the festival opened, with plans to munch 
the afternoon away. Yuhnke and pal Sherrie Wallace first toured the green at 
Irvine Spectrum, taking in all the possibilities. The Buffalo Ranch Steakhouse, 
Saddlerock Ranch and the Miller Light beer stand were high on their list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't take our eating lightly," said the 57-year-old Wallace, who had 
already stationed herself and her friend at a shaded table in the midst of the 
culinary activity. 
</P>
<P>
 With clear skies and temperatures in the high 80s, festival-goers took to the 
few shaded areas available. Some cooled off with samples of ice cream and 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurants offered the 60,000 visitors expected during the weekend a wide 
array of choices that included basic mesquite chicken tacos and the more 
elaborate swordfish with exotic greens. Three stages offered live music ranging 
from country to a cappella doo-wop. 
</P>
<P>
 The culinary tent offered a chance for people to watch award-winning chefs 
from the Ritz, the Four Seasons and John Dominis re-create some of the 
restaurants' most popular dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which opened Friday night, concludes today. It opens at noon and 
closes at 10 p.m. Tickets are $6 for adults and $3 for children. Food samples 
range in price from $1 to $5.

HOSPITAL'S GROWTH TAKES TOLL ON COMMUNITY; SERVICES: AS COUNTY-USC MEDICAL 
CENTER EXPANDS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE POOR, THE COST IS A BROKEN NEIGHBORHOOD 
AND UPROOTED FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Al Juarez, 52, cruises through the streets of Marengo Terrace, but the 
neighborhood he sees is one that is no longer there. 
</P>
<P>
 Marengo Heights Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Camillus Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 And Brittania Street, which used to run north from Marengo Street, lined with 
homes up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The memories are there, but much of Juarez's neighborhood is long gone, eroded 
bit by bit as County-USC Medical Center has grown to meet the needs of the 
county's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 An outpatient clinic stands where the homes on Brittania Street once stood. 
The USC University Hospital has replaced the church. The Francisco Bravo 
Medical Magnet High School is where Marengo Heights Elementary School used to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, Juarez, his family and more than 200 other households 
and businesses on Cummings, Chicago, Charlotte and Marengo streets -- and 
possibly Cornwell Street -- will witness the final transformation of their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 All will be demolished to make way for a single, streamlined 
2.1-million-square-foot county hospital to replace four of the medical center's 
hospitals, including outdated General Hospital and two outpatient clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The new six- to 15-story hospital is expected to save the county $49 million a 
year in operational costs, with improved -- but less costly -- security, the 
consolidation of some services and elimination of others. The $1.1-billion 
construction project is expected to be completed in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the replacement of the 40- to 60-year-old hospitals, federal and state 
regulators, citing safety reasons, have threatened to close the medical center, 
a place of last resort for millions of the county's uninsured and poor. Half of 
County-USC's patients are covered by Medi-Cal and an additional 32% have no 
insurance coverage whatsoever, according to 1993 figures. With 80,000 
admissions a year, 75% of which are emergencies, it is the busiest hospital in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to uproot several hundred residents to build a state-of-the-art 
hospital, County Supervisor Gloria Molina said, was seen as plausible when the 
"greater good" of providing medical care for the county's poor was considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Moreno and his wife, Maria Lourdes, and their two children have lived 
in the area for 11 years, the last four in the home they rent on Charlotte 
Street. Although they love their neighborhood with its nearby park and quiet 
streets, they said they understand the importance of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not good to have to move," said Moreno, 37, a supervisor at a North 
Hollywood manufacturing company, "but if it's good for the community, then it's 
worth the sacrifice we have to make." 
</P>
<P>
 But Juarez, who was born at General Hospital and works with a federal jobs 
training program, sees it differently. His family, which moved to Cummings 
Street in 1950, has fought all along the way to preserve as much of their 
neighborhood as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minority communities are divested of their right to live in the city," he 
said. "Their rights are sacrificed in the process of doing s omething for the 
'greater good' of the community."  
</P>
<P>
 Juarez's 72-year-old mother, Amparo, has seen tremendous changes over the 
years in Marengo Terrace and has raised five children in the process. Her son, 
Manuel, worked as a volunteer at County-USC's trauma center when he was a 
teen-ager and is now a doctor at Loma Linda Hospital. Six people spanning three 
generations now live in the house and a duplex on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, the Juarez family and their neighbors have fought plans to 
change Marengo Terrace and met with some success. When the county hospital 
wanted to build a wall at the edge of their properties about 28 years ago, they 
defeated it. And about 35 years ago they were able to save Hazard Park when 
officials planned to build a veterans hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 But County-USC appears to have won this battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to begin county appraisals of properties by July 1, setting the 
stage for negotiations and buyouts, relocation and demolition. Construction of 
an eight-story parking structure south of Marengo Street will be the 
groundbreaking project. The houses and businesses on Cummings Street will be 
the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has promised assistance to those who will be displaced, up to 
$22,500 for homeowners, in addition to their property's fair market value, and 
a flat payment of 48 months of rental payments for those who have leased 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of moving has been difficult for many, particularly the elderly. 
And it has been especially painful to those who moved here after being 
displaced by other construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked for nine months before I settled on this house," said Lorenzo 
Canales, who moved to Cummings Street in 1953 after being forced out of Chavez 
Ravine to make way for the construction of Dodger Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Esther Troncoso grew up on Cummings Street, was married in St. Camillus Church 
and bought a warehouse up the street from her mother, Francisca Flores. She now 
fears that the family will not be 
</P>
<P>
 able to find homes as close as they are now.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Moreno and other renters say the county's offer will give them an 
opportunity to buy their first home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help us with a down payment for a house," he said. Feelings are just 
as mixed in the business community, where the county has promised fair market 
value and relocation help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's not fair, but what am I going to do?" asked Jenny Shin, who 
has owned the Burger King at Cummings and Marengo streets for nine years. The 
restaurant will be razed to make way for the widening of Marengo and the 
entrance to the new hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Lowe, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles who has 
been helping Marengo Terrace residents through the county process, said 
developers and government agencies have to think hard again before cutting into 
a neighborhood. After Chavez Ravine, freeway projects and now the replacement 
of County-USC Medical Center, displacing neighborhoods has become such an 
expensive proposition -- $35 million in this case -- that it will not be so 
easy in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect William Roger of Romigh Roger Rusk, a Los Angeles architectural firm 
that designed the new hospital, said he and other planners studied several 
alternatives to displacing the neighborhood, but the prohibitive cost of 
demolishing General Hospital and the disruption it would cause to patient care 
forced the county's decision to go into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the new hospital to be placed at Marengo and Cummings streets, 
where the outpatient and AIDS clinics and a parking structure now stand. A 
flat, handicapped-accessible parking lot for 400 vehicles will be built at the 
site of the 15-acre Marengo Terrace neighborhood, as well as entrances for 
outpatient, inpatient and emergency services, and an education and conference 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were planning to build the hospital without having to go into the 
neighborhood until we realized the (1992 Americans With Disabilities Act) 
required this lot," said Frank Villalobos, president of Barrio Planners Inc., 
an Eastside architectural firm and consultant on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hospital will have far fewer public entrances -- only four to six -- 
and an improved security system complete with door metal detectors, thereby 
reducing the medical center's $10-million annual security budget by an 
undetermined amount. 
</P>
<P>
 General Hospital alone has 33 entrances, where ambulances, supplies, family 
members and outpatients arrive. After a gunman shot and wounded three doctors 
last year in the emergency room, a private security company was hired, and 
visitors are routinely screened for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 General Hospital was completed in 1932, before safety codes required fire 
sprinklers and outside exits. Stairwells, which would be used in an evacuation, 
empty into the building instead. And because it does not meet fire codes, the 
hospital must spend $2.3 million annually on a fire watch team whose members go 
on rounds to check for fire and safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 General Hospital was designed with five-bed wards and no private rooms or 
waiting rooms. Wires are strewn across each ward to hold up curtains for 
patient privacy. Fans for ventilation can be found hooked up by extension cords 
in hallways and rooms because there is no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxygen tanks sit in corridors because the facility has no piped-in oxygen. In 
some departments, doctors and nurses examine X-rays on viewing screens in the 
hallways because there is nowhere else to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxane Raffin Chan, a clinical nurse manager in pulmonary, bronchoscopy and 
rheumatology, described time-wasting and exhausting measures to track down 
patients at various clinics on the 72-acre campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice because the population of need is not going away," 
Supervisor Molina said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an example of poor people being pushed out and the compensation 
isn't enough to replace your home. Raggedy as it is, a lot of people think 
(this neighborhood) is home," said Al Juarez.

SENDING MESSAGE OF HISTORY TO JAPAN; EMPEROR'S VISIT: ASIAN AMERICANS FROM SAN 
GABRIEL VALLEY JOIN PROTESTERS SEEKING APOLOGY FOR ATROCITIES DURING 1930S AND 
'40S. 
</P>

<P>
 It might have been a parade, snaking down an entire city block with Korean 
folk drummers, Chinese flags and Buddhist monks with flowing robes and shaved 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the placards gave the truth away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan, Apologize, Do Not Distort History," one sign said. "Asian Holocaust, 
the Forgotten Holocaust," read another. "Japanese Militarism Is Nazism," said a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the placards were held aloft proudly by Gloria Tong of Monterey Park 
and her daughters Faith, 12, and Sheena, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tongs were among 400 Asian Americans, many from the San Gabriel Valley, 
who marched for three miles in the hot sun last Tuesday, weaving from Chinatown 
to City Hall to the Japanese Consulate to demand that the Japanese emperor -- 
who was lunching with Mayor Richard Riordan in Downtown Los Angeles -- 
apologize and pay reparations to victims of crimes against humanity committed 
by his country during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar protest held two weeks ago in Barnes Park in Monterey Park drew 400 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tong said she brought her children to the demonstration because "they're 
Chinese, they should learn about the massacres by the Japanese, and they're not 
going to learn it in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through this protest, at least the Japanese emperor can bring back a message 
to his people," Tong said. "Kids in the new Japanese generation need to know 
the truth. The government should pass on to a new generation that they did 
something wrong. They have to recognize and say they did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Germany, which was forced to atone publicly for its war crimes, Japan 
has successfully downplayed its role as an aggressor in World War II, and 
Japanese history textbooks make few references to the estimated 30 million 
people that Japanese troops killed from 1931 to 1945 in China, Korea and 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor Akihito has expressed "regret" over the war between Japan and the 
United States, but has not formally apologized to the United States for his 
country's role in the war. Kaoruko Sasamoto, press officer for the Japanese 
Embassy in Washington, disputed the number of people killed by Japanese troops, 
adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is deeply remorseful about the events of great dimension (that occurred 
during the war) and the suffering and sadness caused to the people of the 
United States and Asia. Based on this, Japan has decided to be a pacifist 
country and contribute to world peace and prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over reparations has only grown hotter with the passage of 
time. While demands for apologies and reparation did not come up during Emperor 
Hirohito's 1975 visit to the United States, they are being pressed upon his son 
nearly 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the movie "Schindler's List" has spurred on Asian Americans, 
some civic leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the Holocaust West being publicized, but no one's talking about the 
Holocaust East," said Ting Huang, a spokesman for one of the organizing groups, 
United Against Japan for Justice and Reparations Committee, which is based in 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was one of several groups that presented the Japanese Consulate 
with a letter to Akihito. A letter from the reparations committee asked Akihito 
to "assume the historic responsibilities for the Japanese aggression against 
China and the world, thus closing one of the most shameful and barbaric eras in 
Japan's history." 
</P>
<P>
 While the war is more than half a century old, many of the protesters were 
young. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Fan of Temple City, whose father was executed by the Japanese in Shanghai 
during the war, brought his son Fred, 23. The younger Fan said he was there to 
prevent history from being whitewashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard a lot of things from the Japanese, like, 'Can't you just forget 
it, it was 50 years ago,' but that's like telling the Jews, 'Can't you just 
accept the Holocaust,' or telling Japanese Americans, 'Can't you just accept 
the internment camps,' " Fan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang Yun, a South Pasadena filmmaker and Southern California chairwoman of the 
Washington-based reparations committee, was another who marched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Pearl Harbor, millions and millions of Chinese were slaughtered at the 
hands of the Japanese, and the world turned a deaf ear. I just don't understand 
it," Yun said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987 Yun traveled to Nanjing to film a documentary about the massacre of an 
estimated 300,000 people killed at the hands of Japanese troops in Nanking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the world to know what happened," said Yun, 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japanese American groups, politicized by their fight for reparations from 
the U.S. government for the internment camps of World War II, are also putting 
pressure on Japan. One who drew cheers Tuesday was David Monkawa, staff 
director of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Committee for Redress and 
Reparations, a Japanese American organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we (Japanese Americans) are one of the only groups to get 
reparations for crimes, but we're here to offer our heartfelt and undying 
support to get reparations for all those of you who have been victims of 
Japanese imperialism in World War II," Monkawa said.

YOUTHS TEACH PEERS ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH; MEDICINE: T.H.E. CLINIC IS FOR, ABOUT 
AND RUN BY KIDS WHO EDUCATE OTHERS ABOUT SUBJECTS RANGING FROM PREGNANCY TO 
BIRTH CONTROL AND AIDS.

 Enlightening other teen-agers about sexual health and disease prevention is 
not something that Jovan Colbert ever thought he'd be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think like most people my age thought -- nothing can affect me," 
said the 18-year-old Dorsey High School senior, a recent hire at T.H.E. 
Clinic's teen facility in Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the fact of the matter is, teens are sexually active, and they don't know 
all the risks involved." 
</P>
<P>
 That pragmatic approach to sex education is what drove T.H.E. director Sylvia 
Drew Ivie to open a clinic for, about and run entirely by teen-agers. The 
clinic operates on Ivie's belief that teen-agers communicate best with their 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, teens are too shy to discuss things with the regular nurses," said 
Ivie, whose main clinic specializes in low-cost or free women's health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked at all the different programs that address teens, I saw that 
the program that worked most was teens doing things themselves. So that's how 
we set it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen center is housed in a spacious back wing of the clinic at 3970 Martin 
Luther King Jr. Blvd. What was once an ad-hoc conference area is now a waiting 
area, lounge and four individual counseling rooms where teen advocates talk 
privately with clients about everything from pregnancy scares to proper condom 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 The lounge, called "the living room," is a comfortable-looking space filled 
with overstuffed sofas and a monitor that plays informational videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 part-time advocates, trained by the California Regional Family Planning 
Council, also present health workshops at schools, churches and other community 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the presentations and skits are sometimes "not taken seriously 
enough" by young audiences, advocate Carlton Stubbs said, the message that he 
and his co-workers bring is no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot about how AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases 
spread, and I was surprised that it's growing fastest among teen-agers," said 
Stubbs, of Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always think about somebody older getting it and dying. It's important 
that our (black) community knows this information." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem faced by the clinic was a reluctance by teen-agers, especially 
boys, to admit that they need help. Clinic Director Auleria Eakins, 20, said 
the addition of male advocates helped, although girls still far outnumber boys 
as clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys believe that nothing can happen to them -- it's more of a macho 
thing," Eakins said. "They think that going to a clinic makes them look like 
punks, like they don't know everything. But the problem among teen-agers is all 
the same: They lack information." 
</P>
<P>
 Tylar Moore, who became an advocate with the new clinic after months of 
screening teen-agers at T.H.E., said she hopes that the facility will encourage 
young people to come in before they are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the teens were coming in because of a problem -- not for 
information," said Moore, a 17-year-old Dorsey student who aspires to be a 
neurosurgeon. "But it's better now that we have our own space. We used to take 
people in whatever room was available." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ivie: "T.H.E. means 'To Help Everyone.' We're trying to do just that."

FINDING THE RIGHT WORDS; THERAPY: A PRIEST AND A PSYCHOLOGIST USE POETRY IN 
TREATING ALCOHOL- AND CHEMICAL-DEPENDENT PATIENTS AT A MARINA DEL REY HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One is a 55-year-old Catholic priest and the other is a 79-year-old 
psychologist who was raised by an Orthodox rabbi. What they have in common is 
the compassion to heal a damaged and diminished spirit -- and the creativity to 
do so using the words of poets instead of the catch phrases of psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Tom Hedberg and Art Lerner run poetry therapy groups at the Exodus 
Recovery Center, a treatment unit for alcohol- and chemical-dependent patients 
at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they have three Ph.D.s and seven master's degrees. Over a meal at 
Nate and Al's in Beverly Hills, where Hedberg ate potato pancakes with sour 
cream and apple sauce, and Lerner was urging him to order kasha varniskas , 
they discussed Jung, St. Augustine, Norman Corwin and Martin Buber. 
</P>
<P>
 They quote Emily Dickinson, Archibald MacLeish, Langston Hughes and Dante the 
way the rest of us mortals cite entertainment or sports trivia. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men met at Daniel Freeman in 1992, when Lerner was leading a poetry 
therapy group. Lerner found a way to combine the two loves of his life -- 
poetry and psychology -- and, in the process, created a way to touch people. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of the innovators in the emerging poetry therapy field and has 
several books to his credit, the latest being "Poetry in the Therapeutic 
Experience." He's also a published poet. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Hedberg, who came to Daniel Freeman as a counselor, Lerner said: "I found a 
mensch (authentic person), someone with compassion who was a man first. I 
didn't even know he was a priest until we started working together to expand 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg, a former football player and boxer at Santa Clara University, had 
worked with gangs in East Los Angeles, using music as a vehicle to get 
disturbed youngsters to express emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he loved poetry, he never imagined that it could be used 
therapeutically until he watched Lerner work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a double mensch ," Hedberg said, "someone who believes, as I do, that 
life is a mystery to live, not a problem to solve. Someone who understood at a 
deep level that people have to live with themselves, others and a higher power. 
I am not a poet, though, and so he became my teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry, Lerner says, provides insights into the human condition. With proper 
application by someone with a clinical background, it can provide patients with 
insights into their own condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man is capable of doing evil but has a need to be better, which he doesn't 
always understand," he said. "Sometimes, in order to resolve something, he 
makes a mistake and gives up integrity in the process. This creates a 
disturbance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg picks up the point: "We both believe in the soul and spirit of man, 
and poetry really touches that. Look at how Gregorian chants are so popular 
today. St. Augustine said, 'Our hearts are restless until they rest in thee, oh 
God.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a patient who pushed the limits with me, insulted me and was 
irascible with the staff. He wanted miracles. Finally, I said to him: 'Listen, 
I'm not God. I applied for this job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner remembers one session when he read a line from Langston Hughes: "Feed 
me daddy, and love me too." A young woman in the group pulled a letter from her 
purse. She said it was from her father. In reality, she wrote the letter in 
response to a letter of her own -- as part of a fantasy dialogue she maintained 
with her "father." And Lerner used the material therapeutically. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner was born in Chicago. His mother died in childbirth and his father left 
him with maternal grandparents. His grandfather was very old and steeped in the 
Old Testament, constantly questioning the purpose of living. Most of young 
Lerner's development was hidden from public view. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg's father was a builder. From an early age, he remembers being ashamed 
of his father's anti-Semitism. Although he attended a Jesuit university, he did 
not know that he was going to become a priest until he was in a near-fatal 
automobile accident and had an out-of-body experience that left him with the 
thought that when he actually did die, he wanted to know he had led a 
purposeful life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was born in a Jewish family, I would have been a rabbi," Hedberg said. 
"I was drawn to a scholarly life, one that is intellectual and intense that 
dealt with life-and-death issues. I was influenced early on by the great Jewish 
thinkers like Buber and Heshel." 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting two years ago, Lerner and Hedberg became friends immediately and 
went to seminars and conferences dealing with poetry therapy -- a field, Lerner 
said, that is "composed of diverging experiences and interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner says the ancient Greeks told us that Asclepius, the god of healing, was 
the son of Apollo, god of reason and poetry. So, for him, poetry therapy is not 
a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Murphy, medical director of the Exodus Recovery Center, calls Lerner 
a gift and Hedberg a treasure. "Dr. Lerner is the most quoted figure in Europe 
in the field of bringing arts to psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father Hedberg is a remarkable priest and counselor for troubled souls. 
Together, they have more degrees than teeth. It's a gift to me that they 
emerged here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the two men's different religious backgrounds, Murphy says spirituality 
transcends religion. "In order to recover from an addictive disease, a person 
has to enhance their spirituality. And that's what this dynamite duo, this odd 
couple, bring to the principles of recovery -- but through the arts and 
literature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to poet Emily Dickinson, Lerner said: "There's one line of hers that 
stirred something one day. It's 'Tell the truth until it slants.' One person in 
the group responded that you can't tell the truth to people because it hurts. 
So we got into a discussion about who does it hurt. It was a productive day. I 
left the hospital with my horizons expanded." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hedberg, many people have hurts that are denied, entombed parts 
of themselves. He likens a poetry therapist to an archeologist digging to 
uncover the hurts so that the person can touch them again and understand them.

OFF THE STREETS AND ONTO THE FIELD; COMPTON: COACH WHO SAYS SPORTS KEPT HIM OUT 
OF TROUBLE PUTS TOGETHER A BASEBALL TEAM AND FINDS A LEAGUE THAT ACCEPTS HIS 
PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the boys from the Compton 'hood, the four-inning exhibition contest played 
recently in a modest Lynwood park was a chance to be big-league, a chance to 
show that kids from Compton could get together for some reason other than 
running with a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of 13- and 14-year-olds didn't have a name. The players brought 
borrowed bats, one old practice baseball and barely enough jerseys for the 
starters. They had found the old jerseys stacked in a storeroom of a Compton 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opponents, the Blue Jays, didn't bother to wear uniforms for this game 
at Dymally Congressional Park. The contest was just a tuneup for the Lynwood 
recreation league team, an opportunity to stay sharp for league and tournament 
play. They had little reason to fear the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton youths had been hanging out at Burrell-McDonald Park, near the 
west border of the city, when the man who would become their coach, Robert 
Carr, started playing catch with them one afternoon about three months ago. The 
teen-agers remembered Carr as a successful coach at Enterprise Middle School 
from 1989 through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr had lost his job at the school and, with time on his hands, had decided 
to work out with youngsters who had lots of energy, too many temptations and 
too little else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to be just like them.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sports kept me out of the streets," he said. "We wouldn't have all these 
problems if the older boys would put down their beer bottles and guns and help 
these little kids like I remember the big kids helping me." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, competing with the gangs is often harder than winning games on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a Latino kid at Enterprise who had an 80-miles-per-hour fastball as an 
eighth-grader," Carr said. "He was almost unhittable, but he turned to gang 
violence. And he's now dead. He was killed last year in a gang shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr started running and fielding drills in the park. The students hit 
baseballs off tees. They learned the mechanics of playing different positions. 
They played pepper. And they began to think of themselves as Coach Carr's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time I knew I had a team was when the kids started coming every day," he 
said. "They were showing up to practice even when I didn't show up." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr, 30, had been a standout athlete in three sports at Compton's Centennial 
High. His own athletic career was cut short by injuries, including a severely 
broken leg. His 6-foot-4 frame remains lean and muscular. 
</P>
<P>
 He was working in a warehouse when he first began volunteer coaching at area 
schools, which led to a job as a walk-on coach and teaching assistant at 
Enterprise. From 1991 to 1993, Carr's baseball teams finished first twice and 
second once in their league with an overall record of 17 wins and 4 losses.  
</P>
<P>
 Carr also won two championships in football, said Assistant Supt. LaVonne 
Johnson, who had hired Carr when she was the Enterprise principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Principal Gipson Lyles refused to provide any information about the 
past or current performance of the school's sports teams. He would not discuss 
why Carr was replaced as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr lost his job last fall after being involved in a scuffle that began when 
he left school grounds to retrieve a belligerent student. Carr said a school 
official had directed him to bring back the student. He wrestled the student to 
the ground when the boy started kicking him, Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators decided to fire Carr shortly after the incident. 
District officials said they had no comment on the matter. Carr has been doing 
part-time maintenance work and odd jobs while looking for full-time employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was better than all of the coaches I ever played for," said 
shortstop-pitcher Juan Diaz, 13. "He motivates people. I felt bad when he 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was eager to learn from the coach, and like the other players, he also 
wanted to play some real games. Carr feared that the teens' enthusiasm would 
flag without competition. He said he called about a dozen parks to ask about 
joining a league.  
</P>
<P>
 Some leagues were full. Others told him they didn't accept teams from outside 
the area, or that he had missed the entrance deadline.  
</P>
<P>
 "When they hear you're from Compton, it kind of scares them off," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally a Lynwood city league agreed to set up the June 1 practice game, which 
would be an unofficial audition. If Carr's boys were not embarrassed too badly, 
they might be allowed to enter the league.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've waited three months for this," Carr told his players before the game. 
"There's no pressure on us. If it's not fun, we're not doing it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood pitcher Hector Hernandez, 13, used a mitt-popping fastball and a 
sweeping curve to strike out the first six batters. Meanwhile, the cagey 
Lynwood squad turned a few hits and a running game into three first-inning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Carr was teaching: showing his third baseman how to set his 
feet for a tag play, directing his shortstop to hold baserunners closer to 
second base, telling his catcher when to throw through to a base. Carr made 
sure every player batted and took the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 4-0 before Compton broke through against Lynwood's backup 
pitcher for a couple of hits and a run in the third inning. Diaz got the big 
hit, a rocket to left center that went for a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 But this game would have no fairy-tale ending. The Lynwood team won, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was good enough, however, to satisfy Blue Jays coach Oscar 
Flores, 21, a recreation leader for the city of Lynwood. He said his league 
would welcome Compton's participation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just what Carr wants. The news also pleased Sherille Cheatham, the 
mother of 14-year-old Compton catcher Dante Green.  
</P>
<P>
 "If he wasn't here right now, he might be in the streets somewhere hanging 
out, smoking cigarettes, smoking weed," Cheatham said of her son. "So many kids 
are going bad. The gangs are waiting for them with open arms. And if the 
streets get 'em, there ain't no coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Green had practiced with the team only five days because he was 
recovering from a broken arm he got in a fight, Cheatham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be here at the park watching him play than at home not knowing 
where he is and praying," she added. "If I had to go to Cucamonga to buy 
baseballs for this team, I would do it."

KOREAN SUMMIT EXPECTATIONS MIXED; FOREIGN POLICY: KOREAN AMERICANS IN LOS 
ANGELES DRAW SOME HOPE FROM JIMMY CARTER'S EFFORT TO DEFUSE NUCLEAR DANGER, BUT 
MANY REMAIN CONCERNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Korean Americans in Los Angeles have reacted with a range of emotions to 
former President Jimmy Carter's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, 
and the announcement that the heads of South Korea and North Korea will hold a 
summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 To Steve SungGill Chang, president of the Korean-American Federation of Los 
Angeles, the latest development was a welcome respite from months of worrying 
about his homeland because of the standoff between the United States and North 
Korea over Pyongyang's suspected efforts to build a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I can take a little breather now," said Chang, a native of South 
Korea. "I don't trust Kim Il Sung, but I'd like to hope that Carter's visit has 
opened a way to begin a dialogue between Kim Il Sung and (South Korean 
President) Kim Young Sam." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Bong Keon Kim, president of the Los Angeles-based U.S. Federation of 
Korean Americans From Northern Korea, it is naive to believe that Carter's 
efforts or the planned summit of the two leaders will resolve tensions on the 
Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Kim Il Sung's ploy to buy time," said the federation's Kim.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, distancing himself from Carter, recently said the North 
Korean leader should demonstrate his intentions with action, not words. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late last year, when tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear program erupted 
anew, Koreans in Los Angeles have worried about their homeland and family 
members still there. An estimated 400,000 people of Korean ancestry live in 
Southern California -- nearly half in Los Angeles -- the largest Korean 
community outside Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 After North Korea threatened to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, 32 Los Angeles-based Korean American civic, business, legal, religious 
and community organizations formed the Committee for Peace in Korea to offer 
Korean American perspectives to U.S. policy makers and the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korean Americans have no say in U.S. foreign policy (involving Korea) even 
though we are affected by it," said Charles Kim, a member of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been difficult for the Committee for Peace in Korea to make itself 
known to the mainstream. Its inaugural news conference June 17 in Koreatown was 
canceled because all but one reporter from the mainstream media left after 
learning about a press conference regarding O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess O.J. Simpson and the World Cup are more important to the news media 
than the fate of more than 70 million Koreans," Charles Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee rescheduled the conference for Monday morning, only to cancel it 
again when it learned that Simpson was scheduled to be arraigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, a member of the National Democratic Committee's Business Leadership 
Forum, had planned to hand-deliver the group's "urgent plea" about Korea to 
President Clinton during a White House reception Tuesday, but he chose to wait 
on the letter until he can introduce the committee to the Los Angeles media. 
</P>
<P>
 During the committee's news conference with Korean-speaking reporters, 
committee members said their plea urged Clinton, the presidents of North and 
South Korea and other world leaders to find a means to resolve the conflict 
peacefully.

VENICE LEADERS CALL WARNING FLYERS RACIST; ACTIVISM: MATERIAL TELLS WHITES OF 
DANGER OF BEING KILLED BY LATINO GANGS. SELF-DESCRIBED 'AGITATOR' SAYS HE WANTS 
BUSINESSES TO TAKE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 A man whose group has handed out 2,000 flyers warning whites that they are in 
danger of being shot by Latino gangs has vowed to continue distributing the 
material unless the business community steps up concern over gang violence in 
the Oakwood section of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Community and business leaders were quick to denounce the flyers, distributed 
in upscale shopping districts near Oakwood, as racially inflammatory and 
counterproductive to ending the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Crayton, a self-described "agitator" operating out of Wesley House, a 
crisis intervention center in Oakwood, expressed hope that the flyers would 
scare off customers at local businesses, which would in turn motivate the 
business community to pay more attention to rampant gang violence in Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not really here to hurt anyone, but we're dying here," said Crayton, a 
black activist who claims to represent the Shoreline Crips, a local gang. 
"We're tired of carrying casket after casket. The smell of death is everywhere, 
and we're trying to share our misery with the people we spend our money with." 
</P>
<P>
 A war between black and Latino gangs in Oakwood has killed at least 17 people, 
many of them innocent bystanders, and injured 55 in the past nine months. 
Crayton blames the bloodshed on "outside boys," mainly Latinos, and described 
the flyers as an attempt to show whites that Oakwood is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers were distributed to shoppers on Abbott Kinney Boulevard and Main 
Street in Venice and Santa Monica -- artsy, upscale commercial districts 
bordering Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers read: "WARNING UNSAFE AREA; White Customers Shopping in this 
Section of Venice May be Shot Dead by Mexican Gangs -- Without Notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officials said there is no record of any whites 
being shot by Latino gangs in the shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A second handout was distributed in much smaller numbers within the Oakwood 
community. It urged residents to "stop snitching" on local black men. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see black men carrying guns through your yard, support him -- give 
him a sack full of bullets!" the flyer said. "Our youths are out there risking 
their lives to protect you older folks from Mexican bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who have complained that their efforts to end the gang war have been 
stymied by a lack of cooperation from Oakwood residents, were muted in their 
response to the flyers, which appear to be protected under the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants to pass out flyers, even if it's something untrue and 
something we don't like, there's nothing we can do," Police Sgt. Andrew Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But community leaders were quick to distance themselves from the handouts, 
some of which bore the name of New Bethel Baptist Church in Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about it," New Bethel Pastor Marvis Davis said. 
"Whoever wrote it put the name of the church in there so people would read it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Prang, spokesman for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose 
district includes Venice, condemned the flyers as "absolutely outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're inflammatory, they're counterproductive, they're not helpful in 
addressing some of the very serious problems we're having in Oakwood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants, tormented by a lingering recession, handled the flyers as if they 
carried a deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most said they threw them away almost the moment they received them. An 
employee of one store walked around snatching flyers from car windshields 
before anyone had a chance to read them. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Tantau-Smith, a board member of the Abbot Kinney District Assn., refused 
to discuss the flyers within earshot of customers of her jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
 In the privacy of a back room, she defended the Abbott Kinney business 
community as deeply concerned about the violence and active in trying to stop 
it. She also disputed the notion of an all-white business community, noting 
that many stores in the district are black-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeneta Kertisz, a gallery curator on Abbott Kinney, termed the flyers a 
genuine, if misguided, call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate they had to go to such an extreme to get the attention," 
Kertisz said. "You tend to scare people and alienate people even more, but I 
understand why they're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers, according to a credit line at the bottom, were distributed by 
"Venice Pathfinders," a "group of Local African-American Men . . . Committed to 
Real Solutions for the Venice Situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Crayton, publisher of a controversial newsletter that is critical of Oakwood 
community leaders, described himself as the roving coordinator of the 
organization. He contends that Oakwood is the target of a land grab by 
well-healed developers, a popular theory among some locals. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview, he called for federal low-income housing complexes to be 
patrolled by members of his group; the establishment of a "free enterprise 
zone" in Oakwood, Santa Monica and the waterfront to "convert the Shoreline 
Crips into small businesses," and a meeting with local business leaders to 
discuss the violence.

DESHIELDS SHOWS HIS STUFF; DODGERS: HE GETS ON BASE FOUR TIMES AND SCORES TWICE 
IN 4-2 VICTORY OVER ASTROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Delino DeShields returned to play this week, he was hoping all the 
questions about his physical well-being would stop, that all the things that 
have happened to him this season would be put to rest. It's all over, he said, 
all the freak injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday at the Astrodome, DeShields continued his comeback, going two for 
three with two walks and scoring two runs in the Dodgers' 4-2 victory over the 
Houston Astros. His contributions were not as spectacular as Mike Piazza's 
towering two-run homer in the seventh inning that landed high in the 
left-center-field seats, his 16th homer this season. Nor as surprising as Brett 
Butler's solo shot over the right-field wall in the third, his fourth homer 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a team that traded away one of its best pitchers, Pedro Martinez, to 
the Montreal Expos to get one of the best second basemen in the league, the 
sight of DeShields playing well is about as pleasing as it gets.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's like the Magic Johnson of the team, he and Butler," Manager Tom Lasorda 
said. "They are like the guards, they bring the ball down and give it to the 
big guys to put in. They are the catalysts of this club." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind superb pitching by Pedro Astacio (6-5), the Dodgers avenged a 
humiliating 16-4 loss of the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't get upset after a game like that and come back, when do you?" 
said Butler, whose four homers this season equal his total production for the 
previous two seasons. "I was more embarrassed than upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Astro starter Brian Williams (4-4), the Dodgers loaded the bases in 
the first inning but didn't score. Butler homered in the top of the third and 
Houston's Craig Biggio tied it with a homer in the bottom of the inning. Then 
in the fifth, DeShields hit a ball that bounced just inside the left-field line 
and caromed to the corner behind the Dodger bullpen, where a seemingly 
surprised usher caught the ball, holding DeShields on second.  
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was like 70 years old, he was having a good time out there and I gave 
him some action," said DeShields, who scored eventually on a single by Tim 
Wallach, putting the Dodgers ahead to stay. He was also on first after a walk 
when Piazza hit his blast in the seventh for a 4-1 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Astacio's third consecutive victory, and he held the Astros to two runs 
and seven hits in 8 2/3 innings before issuing his first walk of the game. He 
was relieved by Todd Worrell, who struck out Tony Eusebio, the only batter he 
faced, to earn his fifth save, converting his third consecutive save 
opportunity. "That's the Worrell that used to pitch against us," Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 Since returning from the disabled list on Monday, DeShields is beginning to 
play like the second baseman the Dodgers used to play against, too. In five 
games, DeShields is batting .381, going eight for 21 with five runs scored, one 
run batted in and two stolen bases.  
</P>
<P>
 After a series of freak accidents that began in spring training when he was 
hit by a bat while standing in the batting cage, DeShields was never able to 
get his season started. He has missed 28 starts at second base, including a 
recent 21-game stint on the disabled list, during which he had a lot of time to 
think.  
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at all the things that had happened and all the injuries, and it's 
not like I got hurt outside the game, all my injuries were on the playing 
field," DeShields said. "I think sometimes people get tested, and this may be 
my test.  
</P>
<P>
 "Success had always come easy for me, I haven't had any adversity in the game 
until I came here. If I can come back now and pass the test, it will be good 
for me and good for this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields is now batting behind Butler, who has the highest on-base percentage 
in the league. DeShields, who led off for the Expos, says he doesn't have a 
problem with that. "I think me and Bugsy (Butler) have a good thing going and 
we should stick with it," DeShields said.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; MARADONA GETS INTO THE ACT AGAIN, 2-1; 
GROUP D: HE SETS UP BOTH GOALS IN ARGENTINA'S VICTORY, BUT NIGERIANS SAY HE IS 
LOOKING FOR A FALL.

 The game as art was not high drama. Knowing conservative when he sees it, 
former President George Bush and a few well-armed companions departed Foxboro 
Stadium in the 88th minute of Saturday's match, confident of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Bush know his soccer? 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, adept at ball control and theatrical pratfalls, played keep-away in 
a scoreless second half Saturday and held on to defeat Nigeria, 2-1, before 
54,453. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the sweat-shop heat of the postgame interview area, tempers spanning 
two continents came to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams, it seemed, were victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope, we pray to God, that we have a chance to play Argentina again," 
Nigeria Coach Clemens Westerhof said. "And maybe we can have a different 
referee." 
</P>
<P>
 From the winning side, Diego Maradona screamed: "There was no fair play in the 
game. I had to jump high to take care of my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Westerhof: "Maybe far back in his past, the referee is related to Maradona." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfio Basile, the Argentina coach: "Four or five of my players are quite beat 
up after the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It went on like this. The man in the middle was Bo Karlsson, the Swedish 
referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it was difficult to tell whether Karlsson was the worst referee FIFA has 
to offer or merely a sounding board for soccer nations caught up in a budding 
rivalry: Argentina, the venerable champion, against Nigeria, the next 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Argentina clinched Group D with six points and advances to 
the second round. Nigeria can clinch a second-round berth with a victory over 
Greece on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the teams appeared to be posturing for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on statistics, Argentina can make a strong case that it was mugged. The 
Nigerians were called for 33 fouls to Argentina's five. Three Nigerians 
received yellow cards; Argentina drew only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona was fouled eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria, which plays a more physical game, took an early 1-0 lead when Rashidi 
Yekini's pass set up a Samson Siasia goal in the eighth minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina countered with two goals by forward Claudio Caniggia, both set up by 
Nigerian fouls. On the first, Caniggia pounced on a rebound after teammate's 
Gabriel Batistuta shot had bounced off Nigerian goalkeeper Peter Rufai. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, who played a lively first half, had set up Batistuta with a nice 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Caniggia's second goal, the difference in the match, resulted after a free 
kick outside the left corner of the penalty area. Maradona had caught the 
Nigerians napping and quickly nudged a pass left to Caniggia, who hooked an 
unstoppable shot past Rufai into the upper right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Nigerians were tending to other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I congratulate Argentina on scoring two goals while my players were busy 
talking with the referee," Westerhof said. 
</P>
<P>
 True? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we did do that, two times." said Yekini, Nigeria's best player. "They 
took off while we were complaining. Next time we talk, we will hold the ball. 
This is our first World Cup. We are learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Maradona took eight fouls and claimed numerous others, the Nigerians 
thought his act should warrant lifetime membership in the Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maradona is a great actor," a Nigerian journalist muttered after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactically, the teams could not be much different. Nigeria prefers the 
physical game that leads to long kicks to its speedy forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentines, as they proved continually in the second half, are adept at 
ball control. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerians claim referees protect Argentina's finest because they are more 
famous. They said the referee made them so gun-shy with his quick first-half 
whistles they were afraid to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was Argentina's plan to bait its opponent into such a trap, the plan 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nigerian fans did not take it sitting down. At the close of the first 
half, Karlsson was berated with whistles and boos from a small, outraged group 
in the stands as Karlsson exited the field. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, seven state troopers converged on one rooter and removed him 
from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Uche Okechukwu, a Nigerian defender, said Maradona is guilty of wielding undue 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so, in my heart, yes," Okechukwu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Westerhof: "(Maradona) played well at first, but later he became tired 
and complained like a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, meanwhile, said he took a 'terrible hit" to the jaw that will 
require an X-ray today. 
</P>
<P>
 All merely fodder for Round 2? 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked Nigeria a lot until today," Maradona said.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BELGIUM VICTORY MEANS BRAGGING RIGHTS; 
GROUP F: PREUD'HOMME IS UNBEATABLE AGAINST NETHERLANDS AS BELGIANS CLINCH BERTH 
IN SECOND ROUND WITH 1-0 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 This was the championship for their little corner of the world, so members of 
the Belgian and Dutch World Cup teams tossed caution aside like the little 
plastic water bags they threw on the grass of the Florida Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each team needed a victory to guarantee survival in Group F, they 
took the honorable route Saturday instead of plodding safely along to a tie. 
Playing with enough ferocity to suggest the Cup itself was at stake, they 
produced a game of brilliant one-on-one confrontations and a memorable 1-0 
victory for Belgium, a match enjoyed as much by the players as by the sellout 
crowd of 62,387. 
</P>
<P>
 " C'est magnifique ," said Belgian goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme, his smile 
conveying his sentiments in case his meaning wasn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
 So often the weaker partner in a geographic rivalry that began in 1905 but had 
never been pitted them against each other in the World Cup, Belgium claimed 
supremacy thanks to Preud'homme's acrobatics and to a well-placed corner kick 
in the 65th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The inward-swinging kick by Marc Degryse went to defender Georges Grun, who 
headed it to defender Philippe Albert. His left-footed shot snaked past 
Holland's Jan Wouters, who had stationed himself near the left post to help 
goalkeeper Ed De Goey. 
</P>
<P>
 That proved enough to give Belgium only its 39th victory over Holland in 117 
games (they have lost to Holland 53 times and tied 25). The last remaining 
doubt was erased when Preud'homme stopped two late challenges, including a shot 
by Marc Overmars in injury time that Preud'homme tipped off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "To beat a strong team like Holland, that's very, very good. I am very, very 
happy," said Paul Van Himst, Belgium's coach. "If (the Dutch) are having a good 
day, it's very difficult to defend against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said midfielder Franky Van der Elst: "I think in Belgium, they're all going 
crazy now." 
</P>
<P>
 The folks back home had much to celebrate, since Belgium (2-0) is leading the 
group and is assured of advancing to the round of 16. But no one had more 
reason to exult than Albert, who has faced more than his share of adversity in 
the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 First, on March 8, came the knee injury, torn ligaments that jeopardized his 
place on the World Cup squad. Two days later, Albert, his wife and daughter 
were involved in a head-on car crash in the Belgian province of Brabant. Albert 
sustained some bruises, and his wife a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He regained his spot on the roster but temporarily lost his spot in the lineup 
when he was ejected from Belgium's last Cup qualifying game and suspended for 
its Cup opener against Morocco. From that disappointment came his resolve to 
rebound strongly Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my personal point of view, this was revenge because of all the terrible 
problems I have had recently," he said. "There was the injury to my knee, and I 
worked very hard to get back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was great for me. I played a good game and I didn't get any (yellow 
cards). I feel like this was a personal victory that I conquered all these 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Conquering the Dutch was a tough assignment too. Coach Dick Advocaat used four 
forwards in his lineup and their instructions were clear: attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium -- surprisingly for a team that relies on its defense -- mounted 
frequent scoring threats, but the Dutch players' individual skills had the 
crowd roaring. They created a dazzling series of scoring chances, including two 
dangerous free kicks in the first half by Ronald Koeman that sent Preud'homme 
diving to bat the ball down. Midfielder Frank Rijkaard dribbled around 
defenders several times, but no one could solve Preud'homme, who has yet to 
yield a goal in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland (1-1) continued its salvos in the second half, but Preud'homme 
withstood every challenge. The Dutch, one of the pre-tournament favorites, now 
must defeat Morocco Wednesday to advance to the round of 16.  
</P>
<P>
 Belgium, content to assume a defensive posture last Sunday in its 1-0 victory 
over Morocco, was proud to prove it can play well at both ends of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of chances, but so did they. It was really something to see, a 
good game for everybody, including the supporters," forward Josip Weber said. 
"We beat them because we are better, eh?"

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; TO SAUDIS, VICTORY IS THE BONUS; GROUP F: 
TEARS FLOW LIKE GUSHERS AFTER 2-1 TRIUMPH OVER MOROCCO, THE FIRST IN WORLD CUP 
FINALS FOR THE COUNTRY.

<P>
 Oh, there will be gifts. It will be a regular king's ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be currency, cars, the odd oil well. If a grateful royal family 
holds to tradition, Saudi Arabia's stunning 2-1 World Cup victory over Morocco 
Saturday was all about cash and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Or was it? 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't seem like it afterward in the Saudi locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of partying, some of the players were crying. Others were praying. 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't seem like it outside the Saudi bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The players refused to board before hugging and kissing dozens of visiting 
countryman, some who had also been crying. 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't seem like it over the heart of the green jersey of Saudi forward 
Sami Al Jaber. 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked about the gifts, which have enamored Americans ever since it was 
reported that the Saudis received $100,000 and a Mercedes simply for 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaber emphatically grabbed his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "This win was not for the money," he said. "This win was for the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 That soul is soaring today after the first World Cup victory in Saudi history 
and the first by a Middle Eastern team in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This win was for the hopes of our country . . . from the little boy to the 
old man," Jaber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using heart and wits to overcome deficits in athleticism and skill, the Saudis 
have a chance to carry those prayers to the second round with a victory or tie 
against Belgium in their Group F finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moroccans, winless in two games, will probably be on a plane to Casablanca 
by the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got lucky," said Moroccan defenseman Smahi Triki. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis feel there is more at work here. Is there an Arabic word for 
destiny ? 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 500 to 1, but dropping fast," said Fahad Al Dahmash, Saudi team 
manager. "It's very clear that it is God's plan that we not only go to the 
round of 16, but to the round of eight." 
</P>
<P>
 That being true, he certainly worked in mysterious ways Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis were outshot, 29-10. They had only four shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Muhammad Al Deayea, who was devastated when his mistake cost them a 
tie in their opener against the Netherlands, was forced to make three diving 
saves in 10-minute span late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was a Saudi, not a Moroccan, who ended the afternoon by running around 
Giants Stadium bare-chested, waving his shirt and blowing kisses to the crowd 
of 72,404. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Fuad Amin, who broke a 1-1 tie in the first minute of extra time 
at the end of the first half with a goal resulting from a trait that has been 
typical of the Saudis in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The other team stopped working. The Saudis didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 When the scoreboard clock struck 45:00, the Moroccans seemed to be satisfied 
with the 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin, 21, who scored the Saudis' goal against the Dutch, dribbled the ball 
near the penalty area and two defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked left as if he was going to pass, then booted the ball right. 
</P>
<P>
 It sailed about 30 yards, somehow eluding both defenders before skipping past 
goalkeeper Khalil Azmi, who bought the fake and dived in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were stupid, stupid," defenseman Nacer Abdellah said. "We were waiting for 
the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Amin celebrated by running around the stadiums with his arms outstretched, his 
palms upturned, his eyes a portrait of wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same celebration dance done by Jaber, a forward who scored the 
first goal in the seventh minute on a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is us giving thanks to Allah," Jaber said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the penalty kick, Jaber should also be grateful to the team official who 
gave him a tape of Morocco's first-round loss to Belgium. He saw on the tape 
that he was faster than celebrated Moroccan defender Noureddine Naybet, and so 
he raced past him at the first opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Naybet was beaten to the ball, so he tackled Jaber from behind in the penalty 
area, leading to Jaber's penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moroccans tied the score 20 minutes later after a brilliant charge by 
Ahmed Bahja, who outfought one Saudi defender in the corner, then faked out 
another before passing to Mohamed Chaouch, who chipped it in. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Saudis who had all the will. It is the Saudis who believe this 
is about much more than 11 men and a black-and-white ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not have it in the body," team manager Al Dahmash claimed, "but we 
have it in the heart."

<P>
 Anders Limpar, a Swedish midfielder, said Americans should be ashamed for not 
selling out every World Cup match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected every game to be packed with crowds," Limpar said before his 
team's game Friday against Russia at the Pontiac Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 16,000 seats were left unsold earlier this week for a Silverdome 
match between Switzerland and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the popularity of the sport (in the world), it should be packed 
every game," said Limpar, who plays for Everton, an English club team. 
</P>
<P>
 Limpar said this is nothing like Italy during the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were hysterical in Italy," he said. "It's like religion to them. They're 
like mad-dog crazy for it. Every game is like the Super Bowl for the Italians. 
It's a different culture." 
</P>
<P>
 What Limpar fails to mention is that many of the stadiums during Italia '90 
were half empty for games. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 All right chaps, let's get excited about Switzerland. Coached by Roy Hodgson, 
an Englishman, and well-organized, the Swiss beat Romania. . . . The most 
exciting thing about Switzerland is that Hodgson refused to allow his players 
to have sex before matches, and then relented. Now, it is all right as long as 
they don't do it the night before a game. SIMON BARNES / Times of London

 FIFA, soccer's governing body, has spread bad will among some United States 
journalists, damaging professional soccer's chances of surviving here once the 
World Cup has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Boston-area television stations publicly vowed to ignore the 
proposed Major Soccer League team there next year because of what they claim is 
FIFA's arrogant treatment of local broadcast journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA officials also nearly caused a disturbance Thursday after the scoreless 
tie between South Korea and Bolivia by refusing to allow reporters to question 
the coaches during the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were the only ones who could ask questions. While they offered to 
accept handwritten questions from the media, apparently none of those were 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 With several dozen Bolivian journalists pushing and shouting while security 
officers nervously watched, Bolivian Coach Xavier Azkargorta agreed to take 
</P>
<P>
 questions at a different location 
</P>
<P>
 to avoid trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, there have been occasions when FIFA officials made announcements 
in French or Spanish without offering translation. BILL PLASCHKE

 Jorge Solari, Saudi Arabia's coach, is an Argentine who does not speak Arabic.

<P>
 Most of his players do not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it work? The Saudis use two interpreters at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy," said Bandar. "I go into the locker room, and I wonder how my 
coach and players are understanding each other. But I guess certain times, they 
don't need to speak to understand."

 Saturday's Belgium-Holland soccer game, a rivalry with a 117-game history, had 
some similarity to UCLA-USC football.Like UCLA when it plays USC, Belgium 
approached this game as the ultimate showdown. But Holland, much like USC when 
it plays UCLA and has to go against Notre Dame the next Saturday, was less 
intense about the Belgians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one's a nice, friendly kind of match," said writer Jaap De Groot of the 
Amsterdam paper De Telegraaf, "but Holland versus the Germans, that's the big 
one." BILL DWYRE

<P>
 Nearing the conclusion of the first round, it is not too early to begin 
discussing candidates for "most disappointing" dishonors. 
</P>
<P>
 As Colombia has practically clinched the team title, it seems only fitting 
that one of its players should be the favorite in the individual category. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question at this point is whether the goat's horns will fit over 
Carlos Valderrama's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has he failed to make plays in the midfield, he, according to his 
opponents, has caused dissension with incessant chattering at his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But his coach, Francisco Maturana, came to Valderrama's defense Saturday, 
claiming that his behavior in these games has been no different than in others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very typical, these kinds of questions when you lose," Maturana said 
upon arriving in Palo Alto. "When we're winning, everyone says Valderrama is 
supporting everyone on the team. When we're losing, people that he's arguing 
with other players, that he's fighting." RANDY HARVEY

<P>
 The Citrus Bowl in Orlando went from the predominantly green of Mexico and 
Ireland to the bright orange of the Dutch in one day. Outside the press center, 
there was a huge orange flag, decorated with thousands of signatures and 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Dutch visitors, Allert Bolhuis and Eddie Koelfat, explained that the flag 
was the idea of Radio 3, a popular music radio station in Holland. The flag 
traveled from site to site during exhibition games in Holland, and Dutch soccer 
fans wrote greetings and good luck wishes to their team. The only problem was 
that the flag was so large -- roughly the size of a soccer penalty area, 18 by 
44 yards -- that it couldn't be brought into the Citrus Bowl, so they laid it 
on the entryway so the team could see it, as well as others coming into the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 After Holland's 1-0 loss to Belgium, it took 20 men to carry the flag away.

 Winning Group F means Belgium would play its round-of-16 match in Orlando, 
where the heat and humidity might be the worst of all the World Cup venues. But 
the players have begun to like the place, despite the weather.

 Maybe they just like the results they've gotten here so far -- 1-0 victories 
over Morocco and Holland. 
</P>

 "This (victory on Saturday) was important for Belgium because we have six 
points, and because a win against Holland is a special game," Belgian 
goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme said. "Also, we want to stay here in Orlando. We 
are very happy to stay here. We like Orlando and we like Daytona Beach."

 The team's headquarters is near Daytona Beach, at a golf and tennis resort 
about 50 miles from Orlando. HELENE ELLIOTT

 The scale of the party Britain's footballers failed to show up for is becoming 
apparent. This is a World Cup more complete than any other; complete in the 
sense of the joy being contributed from all of the world's continents and in 
the rising stimulation from vast, near-full stadiums, with between 50,000 and 
90,000 people, giving this a unique American flavor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, there is the realization among the host country that this was the 
game, the experience, that millions of America's ethnic groups have been 
waiting to celebrate. . . . We have come quite a way from June 17, when the 
attention span of the corporate box-holders at the opening ceremony and the 
Germany-Bolivia game distracted genuine fans with their personal timeouts, 
their dire need for popcorn and liquid refreshment. ROB HUGHES / The Times of

 -- Unseeded Bryan Shelton, who is the first African-American male since Arthur 
Ashe to advance this far. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes here at crazy Wimbledon, where seeded players have been 
dropping like the dollar and a nation holds its breath for its favorite son. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates isn't likely to win this thing, though you wouldn't know it by the 
Centre Court reception he received before, during and after his 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 
6-3, victory Saturday over Germany's Markus Zoecke. Fans bowed in appreciation 
after Bates' best shots. And each ovation was louder than the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden I'm serving for the match, the noise was just. . . . It was 
incredible in there, everyone cheering for me serving for the match. . . . I 
thought the whole place was going to fall down," Bates said. "It was 
incredible, it really was." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates was one of 18 British singles entries when the tournament began last 
Monday. Now he's one of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I travel 30 weeks of the year and I get abused 29 of them," he said. "It's 
really nice to have one week when everyone's screaming for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates, who reached the round of 16 here in 1992, bristled when asked about his 
status as the lone Brit left in the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the last great hope," he said. "I'm not a great hope. It's just 
nonexistent. You're making the great hope up. I'm not. It's not there. This is 
some fictitious character, it is." 
</P>
<P>
 As Bates dealt with his sudden surge of popularity, Sampras went about his 
business, which is winning matches as quickly as possible. He beat Chuck Adams, 
6-1, 6-2, 6-4, in a match that was suspended last Friday because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, so good," said Sampras, who will play unseeded Daniel Vacek of the 
Czech Republic in Monday's match. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for Becker, the three-time Wimbledon champion who disposed of 
Argentina's Javier Frana, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 1-6, 6-3. Becker will play No. 9 
Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 If Becker goes, so do the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had a bad tournament, German-wise," he said. "I'm the last Mohican, 
and I hope I can keep that candle until the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton, who needed more than four hours to defeat Australia's Jason 
Stoltenberg, 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4, never has advanced to the fourth 
round of a Grand Slam event. He needed to finish in the top 16 of a local 
qualifying tournament merely to earn a Wimbledon invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton will play unseeded Christian Bergstrom of Sweden. Men's Notes 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia advanced with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-4, victory over 
Israel's Amos Mansdorf. When Ivanisevic reached the final two years ago, he ate 
the same thing every day for a week: fish soup, lamb chops, French fries and 
vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. Said Ivanisevic of the experience: 
"In that restaurant they believed me nuts." . . . Shelton is the 12th qualifier 
in the Open Era to reach the round of 16 at Wimbledon.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TORRES WILD INSIDE ON RETURN FOR GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few days after walking out on his teammates, San Francisco Giant 
pitcher Salomon Torres was back in the middle of another controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres hit Charlie Hayes in the face, breaking his left cheekbone, in the 
Colorado Rockies' 6-4 victory Saturday at Denver. Torres also hit Andres 
Galarraga in the left arm one pitch earlier to open the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he didn't mean to hit either batter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start to throw the ball up and at somebody's head," said Rockies 
Manager Don Baylor, "maybe it's time to go back to double A and learn how to 
throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes was on the ground for about two minutes while the Rockies attended to 
him. He then suddenly popped up and tried to get at Torres, but was held in a 
bear hug by Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes was taken to a hospital and was to be re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss for Torres (2-7) was his fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 He had failed to take a team flight to Cincinnati on Monday, but rejoined the 
Giants on Friday night and apologized for his absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres apparently was having a difficult time blending his lifestyle as a 
professional baseball player with his life as a devout member of Jehovah's 
Witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Howard Johnson hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the seventh 
inning for Colorado. It was the second pinch-hit homer of the year for Johnson, 
who has had only three at-bats since June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, St. Louis 1 -- Kevin Foster held the Cardinals hitless for 6 1/3 
innings at Chicago before 39,665, largest of the year at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster (2-1) lost his no-hit bid when Mark Whiten beat out a grounder that 
shortstop Shawon Dunston fielded deep in the hole with one out in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals wound up with three hits, but it wasn't enough to save Vicente 
Palacios (1-6) from the loss, even though he allowed only three hits in seven 
innings and struck out eight, matching a career high. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 6, Cincinnati 0 -- Joey Hamilton pitched a six-hitter at Cincinnati 
for his first major league shutout, ending the Reds' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton (4-2) blanked the league's top-hitting team. Cincinnati was shut out 
for only the second time in 73 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds' Barry Larkin singled in the eighth inning to extend his hitting 
streak to 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 7, Atlanta 1 -- Pitcher Bobby Munoz's first major league homer 
gave him enough runs for his fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz (4-2) hit a three-run homer at Philadelphia off Kent Mercker (6-2) as 
the Phillies snapped a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, New York 1 -- It took only one swing by Orlando Merced and 75 
pitches by Zane Smith at New York to lead the Pirates to their fifth 
consecutive victory. Merced hit a three-run homer and Smith (8-6) went eight 
innings to win for the fourth time in five decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Pena pitched a perfect ninth inning for his sixth save in seven 
chances, preserving Pittsburgh's seventh victory in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, Florida 3 -- Lou Frazier drove in three runs and Moises Alou hit a 
two-run homer at Montreal, sending the Marlins' to their sixth consecutive 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos capitalized on a two-out error by shortstop Kurt Abbott to score 
five runs -- four unearned -- against Charlie Hough (5-6) in the second inning.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEES ARE SINGING IN THE RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took more than seven hours of baseball and rain delays spread over two days 
to bring an end to the longest home winning streak and the longest nine-inning 
game in Cleveland Indian history. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Yankees beat the Indians, 11-6, Saturday, ending Cleveland's 
string of 18 victories in a row at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The game actually began Friday night, but was suspended after seven innings 
and several rain delays because of the American League's 1 a.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The final two innings Saturday were played in a persistent rain. Saturday's 
scheduled game was then called off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took so long to get one win," Yankee leadoff hitter Luis Polonia said. "It 
didn't look like this game was going to end." 
</P>
<P>
 The game even included a pitcher who wasn't a member of the Indians when the 
game began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians lost for the first time at home since Texas beat them May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh inning was completed at 1:18 a.m. Saturday, with the Yankees 
leading, 9-5. The game continued Saturday afternoon, despite showers that soon 
turned the infield to mud. The game officially lasted 4:03, not counting more 
than three hours of rain delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry DiPoto pitched the final two innings for the Indians, who recalled him 
from the minors overnight. The Yankees didn't believe DiPoto should have been 
permitted to pitch, because, technically, he was added to the roster during a 
game in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 10, Milwaukee 8 -- Mo Vaughn hit a two-run homer in the top of the 12th 
inning at Milwaukee for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The game featured seven homers, 26 hits and a 33-minute rain delay in the 11th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston's Andre Dawson went four for seven with two homers and four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Minnesota 1 -- The Royals managed only six hits at Minneapolis, 
giving them only 13 in their last three games, but two of those Saturday hits 
were homers by Bob Hamelin and Terry Shumpert, accounting for three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby Puckett had two hits to tie Hall of Famer Rod Carew for the most in Twin 
history with 2,085. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 2, Seattle 1 -- Jack McDowell pitched a three-hitter at Seattle to 
lead the the White Sox to their fifth consecutive victory. It was the first 
complete game of the season for McDowell (4-7), a Cy Young Award winner last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing pitcher Randy Johnson (9-4) had his seven-game winning streak broken. 
He pitched his seventh complete game and struck out 12, running his season 
total to 129. He leads the major leagues in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 4, Toronto 1 -- Cal Ripken hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the 
eighth inning at Toronto, and the reeling Blue Jays went on to their seventh 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 It's their longest losing streak since a seven-game skid in August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 2, Detroit 1 -- Pinch-runner Scott Hemond scored the winning run from 
third base on a wild pitch by Joe Boever (6-1) in the eighth inning at Oakland, 
giving the Athletics their ninth victory in their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Oakland pitchers combined on a five-hitter.

HALF A FIGHT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR DURAN; BOXING: HE STARTS STRONG, BUT HIS 43 
YEARS CATCH UP AT MID-FIGHT AND PAZIENZA WINS A UNANIMOUS DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Still punching with hands of stone but burdened with legs of granite in the 
final seven rounds, Roberto Duran left the ring Saturday night an exhausted, 
disgusted unanimous-decision loser to Vinny Pazienza. 
</P>
<P>
 At 43 and the underdog, Duran was good for half a fight before 10,149 at the 
MGM Grand, snapping off more hard left jabs and brutal overhand rights to the 
head in the first six rounds than almost anybody thought he could. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Duran legend will stay intact after this bout -- but has Duran's 
career finally wound down? 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after the bout, a calmer Duran said he didn't know. His manager, Luis 
DeCubas, however, raged about a Pazienza second-round slip that was not ruled a 
knockdown and demanded a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I showed the whole world that I'm not that old," Duran said through an 
interpreter. "That guy didn't do nothing. I outpunched him. If this kid is so 
tough, look at his face, and look at mine. What did he do? He slapped the whole 
night. I didn't lose the fight." 
</P>
<P>
 At his highest tide, in the sixth round, Duran sent a sizzling right hand to 
Pazienza's cheek that dropped him face down, the only knockdown of the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, when he knocked me down, I loved it because I wanted 
to see what I would do," Pazienza, 31, said. "I came back like a real champ." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the roars from the pro-Duran audience, Duran lost energy and precision 
beginning with the seventh round, and Pazienza kept buzzing the slower, older 
man with quick combinations that Duran could not defend. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran seemed to find the heart to give it one last surge in the 12th and final 
round, and the two men, both bleeding heavily, stood in the middle of the ring 
and fired shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Chuck Giampa scored the 165-pound super-middleweight bout for Pazienza, 
117-113, and Dave Moretti and Jerry Roth both had it 117-112 for Pazienza, who 
took home the little-regarded Intercontinental Boxing Council championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Pazienza (35-5) won the last five rounds on all of the judges' scorecards and 
dropped Duran's record to 93-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fought a good fight," Pazienza said. "I thought only George Foreman and 
Larry Holmes could pull off the over-40 thing." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Duran appeared to bully and brawl with Pazienza, gaining 
the upper hand with the sheer force of his blows and the ease with which he 
recovered from Pazienza's flurries. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the second round, Pazienza flew sideways to the canvas, but referee 
Joe Cortez ruled it was caused by a slip, not Duran's left-right combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Pazienza rallied in the fourth, bouncing away from Duran punches and scoring 
with left hooks to the body and one hard overhand right. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, with Duran ducking Pazienza and landing punches, he knocked 
Pazienza backward to the canvas with an overhand right with 1:28 gone in the 
round. Pazienza looked stunned, but was up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the sixth round, both Pazienza and Duran were bleeding heavily 
because of an accidental butt that cut both, Pazienza on his right eyebrow and 
Duran in the corner of his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, it was clear that Duran was on his last legs. His jabs came 
fewer and fewer and Pazienza kept up the pace, angling in for quick hooks to 
the body and uppercuts to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier bout, Tony Lopez (45-4-1, 32 knockouts) survived an ugly cut 
over his left eye caused by an accidental butt and blasted the ever-charging 
Greg Haugen for most of 10 rounds before referee Richard Steele stopped the 
junior-welterweight fight at 1:43 of the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
 From the sixth round on, when Lopez knocked Haugen down with a huge right to 
the jaw, and despite receiving the butt in the eighth, Lopez ducked harder 
punches and dominated Haugen (34-6-1) with heavy shots. 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial opening heavyweight bout, a listless Mike Evans (30-10-1) 
was knocked out in the second round by Jorge Luis Gonzalez (19-0, 18 KOs). 
After receiving a right to the chin area, Evans went down but appeared steady 
enough to beat the count. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who threw only two punches in the first round, hadn't been stopped in 
more than 11 years, including three fights against future or former world 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after the bout, the Nevada State Athletic Commission announced that it 
would withhold Evans' $20,000 purse, pending a hearing to investigate the 
circumstances of the knockout.

POPE GETS TO THE POINT IN DUEL AGAINST TSENG; JUNIOR TENNIS: HE SURVIVES, 7-5, 
6-3, IN TENSE SEMIFINAL BETWEEN PLAYERS RECOVERING FROM INJURIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The stakes were unusually high for two tennis players who were recovering from 
injuries and trying to play their way back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 But Derek Pope of Ojai and Philip Tseng of Los Angeles and Harvard-Westlake 
High are no ordinary players. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope and Tseng are two of the best 18-and-under players in the Southland and 
both are extremely competitive. Which explains why the two faced each other 
Saturday in the boys' 18 singles semifinals of the Southern California Junior 
Sectional tournament at Los Caballeros Sports Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Pope was recovering from a broken left wrist, Tseng a broken left 
leg. If the results are an indication, Pope's injury was probably less severe. 
</P>
<P>
 He beat Tseng, 7-5, 6-3, to advance to today's final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved," said Pope, who survived five set points in the first set. "I 
wanted to beat him really bad. I want to win this tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the two haven't played since they met in the Sectional semifinals in 
the 12-and-under division, Pope said he and Tseng are old rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly were vocal and they battled like two boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Tseng had second-seeded Pope on the ropes early. Pope had to 
serve 19 times to avoid being broken on his first service. At one point, Tseng 
was leading, 5-4, and had a triple-set point on Pope, who was serving at 
love-40. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't you make a shot under pressure?" Pope yelled at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was yes. After the game went to deuce and Tseng had two more 
set-point opportunities, Pope served to make it 5-5. Then he broke Tseng with a 
lob, and served out the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng gave some credit to Pope, who served and volleyed, and attacked Tseng's 
forehand. And it was obvious that Tseng, though cat-quick with a deadly 
backhand, didn't have the stamina to stay with Pope's constant pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng looked tired when he put an easy overhead smash into the net in the 
seventh game of the second set, giving Pope a service break. 
</P>
<P>
 "Choke," Tseng yelled at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pope held serve to lead, 5-3, Tseng double-faulted, hit a wide return, 
then watched Pope switch hands with his racket and hit a left-handed overhead 
winner to make it deuce. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tseng followed with a forehand into the net (giving Pope match point), he 
barked, "This is the bleeping worst day of my bleeping life. I feel like 
bleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Pope ended it with a backhand cross-court winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he broke his leg in a skiing accident at Mammoth Mountain the first week 
of April, Tseng has played little tennis and certainly nobody has pushed him 
like Pope. The closest Tseng came to losing before Saturday was a 6-7, 6-1, 6-0 
victory over Dennis Chang of Rancho Palos Verdes in Wednesday's opening round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely know how he feels," said Pope, who suffered a hairline fracture 
in his wrist while diving for a ball in the Arizona Easter Bowl tournament in 
March. "You get out of tournament toughness." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of toughness, Pope will face top-seeded Jakub Pietrowski of 
Huntington Beach in today's noon final. Pietrowski, who beat No. 4 Nate Jackmon 
of Goleta, 6-1, 6-3, is Pope's doubles partner. The two are national 
18-and-under clay-court champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope has beaten Pietrowski only once in four tries, losing the last three. 
"The scores have been pretty bad," Pope said. "Like 0 and 1, 2 and 1, 2 and 2." 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' 18 singles, top-seeded Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks advanced to 
the final, where she will meet No. 4 Violette Ahn of Los Angeles at 10:30 a.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski beat No. 7 Tu Dong of Long Beach, 6-1, 6-1, in the semifinals. Ahn 
defeated No. 6 Rosemary She of Cerritos, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' 16 singles, top-seeded Joseph Gilbert of Fullerton defeated No. 3 
Dylan Mann of Canoga Park, 6-4, 6-3, in the semifinals. Mann will play No. 7 
Andrew Scorteanu of Palm Springs for third place today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' 10 singles final, top-seeded Angela Haynes of San Clemente beat 
No. 2 Lori Stern of Ojai, 6-1, 5-7, 6-2.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL ; WESTLAKE-ROYAL TO PLAY FOR TITLE AFTER DEFEATING 
VALLEY RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Schuster's eighth-inning single drove in the winning run for the 
Westlake-Royal American Legion team in a 7-6 victory against the Valley Rangers 
in a semifinal of the Sierra Nevada Classic Saturday at Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal (13-2-1) will face either San Mateo or Reno in the championship 
game today at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster's hit was set up when Joel Mellinger led off the eighth with a single 
and took third on Randy Wolf's wild pickoff throw. The Valley Rangers, a 
Glendale-based Connie Mack team that includes some of the San Fernando Valley's 
best players, intentionally walked the next two batters to bring up Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal sent the game into extra innings with two runs in the bottom of 
the seventh, scoring the tying run on a two-out wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills East 12, Burbank South 1 -- Rusty Jenkins struck out nine and 
scattered three hits over seven innings as Woodland Hills East won a game 
called after seven innings at Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Horowitz and Greg Venger each drove in two runs for Woodland Hills East 
(2-7). Burbank South scored an unearned run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills West 16, Antelope Valley South 4 -- John Novak had five hits 
and Justin Balser added four, leading Woodland Hills West in a District 20 game 
at Antelope Valley High. Craig Carlton pitched a complete game, giving up only 
one earned run. The game was called after seven innings because of the 10-run 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park 10, Van Nuys East 4 -- Gus Lomeli pitched a complete game for his 
third consecutive victory as Canoga Park won for the sixth time in seven games. 
David Vargas had two hits and two RBIs for Canoga Park (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills East 10, Mission Hills 9 -- Granada Hills scored seven runs in 
the ninth inning to pull out a District 20 victory at Alemany. Aldo Pinto 
scored the winning run on a sacrifice fly by George Kassis. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall-Santa Clarita 19, Burbank North 0 -- Lucas Solomon pitched four 
scoreless innings and was three for three with two doubles, leading 
Newhall-Santa Clarita (9-1) in a District 20 game at Burbank High. 
</P>

innings, picking up the victory for West Hills (5-5) in a District 20 game at

ONSAGA HOT, BUT DIBIASE IS HOTTER; LEGION BASEBALL: VALLEY NORTH RIGHT-HANDER 
GOES THE DISTANCE IN A 2-1 INTERDIVISION VICTORY OVER VERDUGO HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Much to the pleasure of those baking in the sun Saturday at Chatsworth High, 
Valley North and Verdugo Hills played an unusual American Legion baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North right-hander Jim DeBiase beat Verdugo Hills left-hander Phil 
Onsaga, 2-1, in a District 20 interdivision game. While many Legion games 
finish with what look like football scores and drag on well beyond three hours, 
this game was played well and quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see a lot of games like this," said Valley North Coach Pete 
Redfern. "You had two pitchers who were throwing strikes and putting the ball 
in play. And they were getting good defense." 
</P>
<P>
 There was one error in the game, which lasted only 2 hours 10 minutes, 
including a 10-minute delay while the coaches debated a lineup card mixup in 
the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Both DeBiase and Onsaga pitched well, but DeBiase was better. He threw a 
complete game, giving up five hits and one walk. He struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw a great game, going nine innings on a hot day like this," Redfern 
said. "He came up huge when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase (3-0) said he tried to be efficient with his pitches, rather than 
going for strikeouts, because of the sizzling Valley heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to make it easy on myself and then let the defense take care of 
it, and they did a good job," DeBiase said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase's defense helped him out several times, particularly in the ninth 
inning. After leadoff batter Corby Foster reached first base on an error, 
catcher Tony Ardito threw him out trying to steal second. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Gantt then singled, but Valley North (7-2) ended the game with a double 
play, from third baseman Tony Montiel to second baseman Rod Daryabigi to first 
baseman Brandon Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Onsaga (3-1) gave up two only two runs, both in the bottom of the third. As it 
turned out, it was was one run too many. He gave up a leadoff home run to Fred 
Farzaneh. Danny Martin then walked and scored after back-to-back singles by 
twin brothers Rod and Ray Daryabigi. 
</P>
<P>
 Onsaga lasted 6 1/3 innings before tiring, but he gave up only five hits and 
struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really proud of Phil," said Verdugo Hills assistant Marcel Martinez. 
"He threw too well to lose, but someone had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was filling in for Verdugo Hills Coach Spiro Psaltis, who was out of 
town Saturday, and he cost his team an out with a lineup mixup.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez listed Vinnie Sinatra as the designated hitter in the No. 9 spot. 
Martinez had Sinatra batting for left fielder Ben Malen, which is permitted in 
high school baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 But Legion rules allow the designated hitter to bat only for the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sinatra stepped to the plate in the third inning, Redfern called the 
error to the umpires' attention. The umpires ruled an out in the No. 9 spot and 
Malen went into the batting order for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was in that inning that Verdugo Hills (9-2) had its only 
offense. With two out and the bases empty, Davey Garley doubled down the 
left-field line and scored on Loren Geller's infield single, giving Verdugo 
Hills a 1-0 lead.

BULLFROGS CAN'T CATCH UP AFTER SLOW START; ROLLER HOCKEY: THEIR LATE RALLY 
FALLS SHORT IN 9-7 LOSS, ANAHEIM'S FIRST IN REGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Diego Barracudas defeated the Bullfrogs, 9-7, in a Roller Hockey 
International game Saturday night at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, in regulation, is the first in franchise history for the Bullfrogs, 
who finished last season 17-0-1 and started this season with five victories. 
</P>
<P>
 After ending the first quarter in a 2-2 tie, the Barracudas scored five 
consecutive goals, three in the second quarter and two in the third. Scott 
Gruhl and Marc Savard scored two goals each for the Barracudas during the 
five-goal run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs started the fourth quarter by scoring three consecutive goals. 
Brad McCaughey at 2:29; Joe Cook at 5:29 and Jim Brown's goal at 8:38 cut the 
deficit to 8-6. But Gruhl put the game out of reach with his fourth goal of the 
night at 10:34. 
</P>
<P>
 Barracudas goaltender Francis Ouellette earned the victory by recording 41 
saves as Anaheim outshot San Diego, 57-41. 
</P>
<P>
 "Francis Ouellette was the key to our first loss. He was outstanding early in 
the game, and after the start, it was hard to come back," said Anaheim Coach 
Grant Sonier. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby McKillop had two goals and two assists for the Bullfrogs, who dropped to 
5-1-0 with 10 points on the season. The Barracudas improved to 4-3-0 with eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs play the Blades at 5:05 tonight at the Forum.

DEFENSIVE STRATEGY NETS VICTORY FOR U.S. TEAM; WATER POLO: IT HOLDS OFF 
AUSTRALIA TO WIN, 5-4, AND ADVANCE TO GOLD-MEDAL MATCH AT ALAMO CUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. water polo Coach Rich Corso is using a defense-first strategy in 
preparing his young team for future international battles, and Saturday he 
enjoyed the early returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States beat Australia, 5-4, in the semifinals of the Alamo Cup at 
Corona del Mar High School to advance to the gold-medal match at 2:30 p.m. 
today against Hungary. Hungary beat Cuba, 14-10, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a satisfying victory because Australia, which had never won a medal in 
a major international competition, beat the United States for the bronze medal 
at the FINA World Cup last year, but more importantly to Corso, it showed that 
the U.S. defense is jelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our emphasis has always been on defense," Corso said. "We did not have a 
breakdown defensively today. We broke down offensively a couple of times 
though. We had opportunities to almost put the game out of reach." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-meter man Troy Barnhart scored two fourth-quarter goals, the second giving 
the United States a 5-3 lead with 2 minutes 10 seconds remaining in the match. 
Australia cut the lead to one with six seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team also led by two goals, 3-1, at the half, but Australia scored 
two consecutive goals in the third quarter to tie it. Both goals came in 
man-advantage situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia was playing without two of its better players, former Pepperdine 
standout Geoffe Clark, who was recently married, and Paul Oberman, who is 
injured. The U.S. team was without its leading scorer, Chris Humbert, who 
hasn't returned from Italy, where he plays professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia and the United States trained together last week at a higher 
altitude (Colorado Springs, Colo.), so the style of play was familiar. The 
match was physical but cleanly played, "a good arm wrestle, I thought," said 
Australian assistant Don Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Hackett, in goal for the United States in the first half, made three 
steals and was credited with three saves, including one on a penalty shot by 
Mark Oberman. Hackett, a former UCLA All-American who played at Irvine High, 
said his teammates keyed his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really fun the last couple of games," Hackett said. "Our team has 
jumped out and scored first in every game and that eases the pressure on me. It 
seems to fuel our defense when our offense clicks early." 
</P>
<P>
 The offense wasn't making too much noise, Chi Kredell, Todd Hosmer and Rick 
McNair each scored first-half goals, but with Hackett and Chris Duplanty, in 
the second half, leading the defense, the United States didn't need much. 
</P>
<P>
 Duplanty, a former UC Irvine All-American and two-time Olympian, made five 
saves, including one at point-blank range. Duplanty was helped by teammates who 
often blocked shots before they reached him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys have been playing outstanding in front of both Danny and myself," 
Duplanty said. "There are times when we don't even have to block the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Play starts at 10:30 a.m. today, with a match between Mexico and Japan. The 
U.S. B team, which beat Mexico, 9-5, Saturday, plays Canada at 11:45. Cuba and 
Australia play for third place at 1 p.m.

DIGEST: RIEDMILLER LEAVING CAMARILLO, WILL TEACH AT CHANNEL ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Riedmiller, who guided the Camarillo High boys' track and field team to 
its first Marmonte League title in 12 years this season, expects to be teaching 
at Channel Islands High in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Riedmiller, 37, coached track and football and taught special education 
classes for the past four years, but was told earlier this month that budget 
cuts would prevent the school from rehiring him. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands has offered him a special education position that he plans to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a temporary teacher and the numbers just didn't add up," Riedmiller 
said. "In no way am I bitter at all. I'm going to miss the kids at Camarillo 
and the school itself because I graduated from there, but you've got to do what 
you've got to do. You have to go where the jobs are." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo posted a 12-2 record in Marmonte League competition during 
Riedmiller's two seasons as boys' track coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to that, he was the Scorpion girls' coach in 1992 and an assistant who 
worked with the jumpers in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In football, he was a varsity assistant in 1990 and '91 and the junior varsity 
coach in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is interested in coaching at Channel Islands in some capacity, but 
has yet to discuss it with school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 No successor has been named at Camarillo. Baseball  
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High graduate Ryan Hankins was one for three with a three-run home 
run, helping the California All-Stars to a 13-2 victory over Florida in the 
championship game of the Sunbelt High School Seniors Baseball Classic on 
Saturday in Edmond, Okla.  
</P>
<P>
 Hankins' home run was part of a six-run second inning. The game was called by 
mutual agreement after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins, who made the All-tournament team, was 13 for 23 with nine runs batted 
in. He also started an around-the-horn triple play while playing third base. It 
is believed to be the only triple play in the 19-year history of the series.

FISCHER CLEARS 7-2 1/2, STAYS UNDEFEATED OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jeremy Fischer, who graduated from Camarillo High last week, hit a grand slam 
of sorts Saturday when he won the high jump in the USA Track & Field Junior 
championships at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer cleared 7 feet 2 1/2 inches to turn back Henry Patterson (7-1 1/2) of 
Toledo University and Eric Bishop (7-0 1/4), who recently graduated from Murray 
County (Ga.) High. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop cleared a personal best of 7-4 1/4 to defeat Fischer (7-2) in the 
National Scholastic Indoor championships in March, but he has been unable to 
keep pace with Fischer outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two finishers in each event qualified for the U.S. team that will 
compete July 14-15 in a meet against Canada, Jamaica, Cuba and Japan in 
Buffalo, N.Y., and in the World Junior championships July 20-24 in Lisbon, 
Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer's victory kept him undefeated outdoors this season and followed 
victories in the state championships, Golden West Invitational and National 
Scholastic Outdoor championships the previous three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really stoked right now," Fischer said. "My main goal coming in here was 
to qualify for the team and win so I'm really happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, third in last year's meet, cleared 6-7 1/2 on his opening height 
before passing at 6-8 3/4, 6-9 3/4 and 6-11. 
</P>
<P>
 He made 7-0 1/4 on his second attempt before clearing 7-1 1/2 on his third. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson took the lead temporarily by making 7-1 1/2 on his second attempt, 
but Fischer won when he cleared 7-2 1/2 on his second try and Patterson missed 
all three of his. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer concluded the competition with three misses at 7-5, which would have 
broken the state record of 7-4 1/2 set in 1983 by Maurice Crumby of San 
Francisco Balboa High. 
</P>
<P>
 His first and third attempts at 7-5 were not close, but he narrowly missed the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still trying to find the thread on his uniform that knocked the bar off," 
Coach Dennis Riedmiller said. "I really thought he had it." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Fischer, who has a personal best of 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know what I hit it off with," he said. "I felt good going over 
the bar, but it came off when I hit the pit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer's clearance at 7-2 1/2 marked the seventh meet this season in which 
he's jumped 7-2 or higher and the 11th time this season he's cleared at least 7 
feet.

RACING ROUNDUP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riverside's Roger Thompson, riding for the Granada Hills-based Dodge Brithers 
Racing team, was the only multiple winner in the third Vintage Short Track 
Motorcycle Races at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson won two consecutive races, taking the 10-lap Class C Footshift main 
event on a 1968 Harley-Davidson KR750, and going wire to wire in the 
650-to-950cc Class 10-lap feature on a 1972 Harley XR750. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Davis of Woodland Hills was entered in three classes, winning the 450cc 
Asian Class 10-lap main on a 1973 Honda XL350, but ironically enough, Thompson 
was one of the racers who kept Davis from his second victory of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson passed Davis coming out of Turn 2 on the fourth lap in the 
650-to-950cc race, going on to win by several lengths, and Davis finished third 
behind Jeff Gabhart, but was moved up to second when it was discovered that 
Gabhart's Honda did not meet the specifications for the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Rosa defeated Davis in the second Class C footshift 10-lap main. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1000cc-and-up Hooligan Class 10-lap feature, Ventura's Dave Duvarney 
held off Canoga Park's Rick Stecyk to win the closest race of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Stecyk, who finished third in the 450-and-under Class two years ago while 
racing with a broken hand, led the first four laps before he was forced to slow 
down in Turn 4 by a slower bike in his path, allowing Duvarney to slip past. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final lap, Stecyk pulled even with Duvarney heading into Turn 3, but 
lost traction coming out of Turn 4. DARIN ESPER

 Derya Buyukuncu continued his dominance at the Swim Meet of Champions, winning 
the 50- and 200-meter freestyle events Saturday at the Marguerite Aquatic 
Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu, 17, took an early lead in the 200 free, but was challenged by 
fellow Turk Ugur Tanner in the last 25 meters of the race. "I could see that 
Ugur was coming up, but I was able to hold on and win the race," said 
Buyukuncu, who won the 100 free and set a record in winning the 200 backstroke 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu's winning time of 1 minute 52.62 seconds in the 200 was two seconds 
faster than a senior national qualifying time and .20 faster than Tanner's 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Buyukuncu doesn't like to swim the 200, Irvine Novaquatics Coach 
Dave Salo put him in the event anyway. "Sometimes I don't think Derya really 
knows what he wants to swim," Salo said, noting that this was the second time 
Buyukuncu swam the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50 free, Buyukuncu held off a strong field, which included Tanner and 
University of Calgary's Steve Vandermeulen, to win in 23.84, .60 of a second 
off the meet record. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 400 individual medley, Curtis Myden of the University of Calgary led 
nearly the entire race in beating former Laguna Hills star Chad Carvin. Myden's 
winning time was 4:28.27. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's 400 individual medley, Michael Flaherty of the Trojan Swim Team 
was able to fend off a couple of 13-year-olds to win in 4:59.08. Jennifer 
Parmenter, swimming for Canyons, was second in an impressive 4:59.37, followed 
by Monica Shannahan of Blue Fins in 5:02.26. Parmenter's swim was a senior 
national qualifying time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rae Abbott of Hyack Swim Club finished first in the women's 200 breaststroke 
(2:39.83) and Michael Mason of the Trojan Swim Club took first in the men's 200 
breaststroke (2:18.83). 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200 free, Janet Evans couldn't catch Marianne Limpert of the University 
of Calgary, who finished first in 2:03.07, .32 seconds faster than Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50 free, Calgary swept first and second places with Andrea Nugent 
winning in 26.61 and Jessica Amey second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojan Swim Club won the women's 800-meter freestyle relay in 8:26.13. 
Stanford's team was second. In the men's relay, Calgary beat Stanford by more 
than four seconds to win in 7:43.78. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminaries of the final day of competition begins at 9 a.m. today, with 
finals scheduled for 4 p.m.

 Artic Fuzz posted the biggest upset of the Hollywood Park meeting when, with 
help from the stewards, he won Friday night's ninth race. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start as a gelding and racing for the first time since Sept. 
9, 1993, Artic Fuzz finished second under Jose Silva in the $25,000 maiden 
claiming race, but moved up when first-time starter Go Hardy Go was 
disqualified to third for interfering with favored Romanticon in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by the Way-Jo Stables and trained by Leon Boykin, who had failed to hit 
the board with two previous starters at the meeting, Artic Fuzz paid $220.80. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first three races, all last year at Del Mar, Artic Fuzz had been beaten 
a total of 49 lengths. He finished last at 111-1 in his debut, then finished 
10th of 12 at 125-1, and in his final race before Friday was ninth at 157-1.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; MASHAALLAH LETS FRANKEL WIN MURRAY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel and Times columnist Jim Murray can count on seeing each 
other at least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Four out of the five times that Hollywood Park has offered the Jim Murray 
Handicap, Frankel has trained the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find room until late in the stretch under Laffit Pincay, favored 
Mashaallah beat 11-1 shot Marfamatic by a length in a stakes-record 2:25 1/5 
for the 1 1/2 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his second start in the United States and first on Lasix after being 
well beaten in the Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 30, Mashaallah paid $5.80 as 
the 9-5 choice in winning for the ninth time in 22 races. He earned $46,600 for 
owner Jorge Cardemil. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a top-class race (the Murray is a restricted stakes), but it's a 
good race and sometimes you go on to bigger and better things with these 
horses," Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think eventually (Mashaallah) could get back to a higher level. He wasn't 
the best (in Europe), but he was like a Group III to Group II-type horse. He 
can run all day and he was impressive today. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's tough and he had to do what he had to do. He bled last time, so the 
Lasix helped and Laffit rode a race that I like to be ridden. You just sit in 
there and (stay) cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start since April 24, Marfamatic got the lead briefly, then 
wound up three lengths in front of Samourzakan. Navire was fourth and 
pacesetter Bolt The Hatch faded to fifth and last. Newton's Law and Time For 
Lightning were scratched.

 Getting ready for this Saturday's $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup, The Wicked 
North worked five furlongs in 59 seconds Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went great," regular rider Kent Desormeaux said. "He was phenomenal, 
scintillating." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither The Wicked North's trainer, David Bernstein, or Arcangues' trainer, 
Richard Mandella, complained about the 122 pounds each was assigned for the 1 
1/4-mile Gold Cup, but Gary Jones, the trainer of Kingdom Found, disliked the 
116 given his horse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was going to talk with owner Ray Dilbeck about sending the 
Californian runner-up to Belmont Park for the $350,000 Suburban Handicap on 
July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try and get nine pounds from Devil His Due and only have one horse to 
beat," Jones said. "I'll talk with Mr. Dilbeck and we'll decide. But I think 
they're weighting more on what they think he'll do, not what he's done. He's 
never won a stakes race and he gets the same weight as Fanmore." 
</P>
<P>
 Racing secretary Martin Panza noted that Kingdom Found was assigned the same 
weight he had in the Californian, when he finished only a neck behind The 
Wicked North in a track record 1:46 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary knew the (allowance) conditions of the Californian going in and he chose 
to run when he was getting only four pounds from The Wicked North," said Panza, 
who assigned the Gold Cup weights. "He's carrying the same weight he did in the 
Californian. He only lost by a neck and he's getting two more pounds (from The 
Wicked North)." 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been made regarding Bien Bien, who was assigned 121 pounds. 
Bien Bien finished 2 3/4 lengths behind The Wicked North in the Santa Anita 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Owners Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan) are coming back from Canada," 
trainer Paco Gonzalez said. "They'll be here on Monday, so we'll wait until 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Post positions for the Gold Cup will be drawn on Thursday and the race will be 
run as the third on Saturday and be televised by ESPN. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem, the 3-5 favorite, held on to beat Miss Dominique in the 
$60,000 Ski Goggle. This was the third consecutive victory for the 4-year-old 
Moscow Ballet filly and she now has 10 victories in 13 lifetime starts. She 
completed the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5. This was one of four victories 
Saturday for Chris McCarron, who is now two shy of 6,000. . . . Trainer Bobby 
Frankel also won the $150,000 Golden Gate Budweiser Breeders' Cup with heavily 
favored Tinners Way Saturday. It was the first victory in eight American races 
for Tinners Way, who was ridden by Kent Desormeaux. Talking Salsa was second 
and Seahawk Gold was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, who is on target for a rematch with Sardula in the Hollywood Oaks on 
July 10, worked a half-mile in 46 1/5 Saturday morning, the fastest of 48 
workouts at the distance. . . . Frankel's other Murray victories came with 
Toulon, Berillon and Shotiche. . . . Golden Klair, unbeaten in three starts at 
Hollywood Park, is the 2-1 morning-line favorite in the $162,400 Milady 
Handicap today. Other entrants are Likeable Style, Andestine, Zarani Sidi Anna, 
Lunar Spook, Oxava and Southern Truce.

WESTSIDE WATCH: FOR BEVERLY HILLS OFFICIAL, IT'S A NEW KIND OF HIGH LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working as a city employee in Beverly Hills could be considered a career apex 
-- the city is world famous and financially sound, and there is a black-tie 
party about once a week. But for Assistant City Manager Peggy Curran, there is 
still higher ground to conquer . . . about 8,500 feet up in the Colorado 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Curran, who has been with Beverly Hills since February, 1992, 
announced that she was resigning her $100,000-plus job to become city manager 
of the tiny ski hamlet of Telluride, Colo., at a salary of about $80,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Avid skiers, Curran and her husband will be leaving balmy Beverly Hills on 
Aug. 1 to start her new job Aug. 29 -- in plenty of time to get ready for a 
full season of skiing. There will be some adjusting to do: The town is measured 
in blocks, not miles, everyone leaves their keys in their cars, and the nearest 
stoplight is 65 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Curran: "Beverly Hills has been wonderful, but adventure beckons."

 WANTED: Mole to run district office of State Sen. Tom Hayden.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has put out a job announcement calling for 
candidates to head up a revamped district office -- now to be called a 
"Community Office." The office's charge: "identifying and investigating 
scandal, corruption and wrongdoing by the area's governmental agencies that 
harm the people -- and organizing community activists to protect our 
residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden aide Sarah Rath says her boss is looking for someone with an 
investigative bent as part of his effort to identify and expose fraud and 
special-interest abuse. The office director would also assist Hayden in 
examining appointments to state boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would want to be able to have someone to monitor all levels of government 
-- but focusing on state government," Rath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and Hayden is offering annual pay of $50,000 (depending on salary history) 
plus benefits.

 ENDORSEMENT ABSENCE: Vanquished primary candidates usually fall into line 
behind their party's nominee, swiftly putting intra-party rivalry aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is not the case with the runner-up to Richard Sybert in the Republican 
contest in the highly competitive 24th Congressional District, which stretches 
from Malibu to Reseda. Robert K. Hammer, a Newbury Park investment banker and 
first-time candidate who received 17% of the vote, pointedly vowed to withhold 
his backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer had questioned his opponent's commitment to the district because Sybert 
moved there last fall in order to run. Sybert, who grew up in Southern 
California, cited Hammer's failure to vote in a number of elections. The two 
locked horns on other issues as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I will give the devil his due and the 15 minutes of fame he will 
demand, the man fresh from Sacramento will receive no endorsement from this 
camp; nor, given the way that campaign was run, can he legitimately expect 
one," Hammer said in a note to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Sybert did not see things the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's obviously just sour grapes," Sybert said. "I'm sorry he feels that 
way. That is not proper behavior and I hope, after he calms down, that he will 
come to the same conclusion."

TESTING THE WATER; BEVERLY HILLS: OFFICIALS HOPE AN EXPLORATORY WELL FINDS A 
RESERVE OF ADEQUATE QUALITY AND VOLUME TO ALLOW THE CITY TO PARTIALLY SUPPLY 
ITS OWN NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beverly Hills this week moved closer toward construction of its own water 
system, which could mean lower rates for customers and independence from the 
city's sole supplier, as engineers began digging a 600-foot-deep well on Burton 
Way to test the quality and volume of underground water. 
</P>
<P>
 The test well is a critical step in the proposed $12-million municipal water 
project, which officials said would mean less reliance on the Metropolitan 
Water District in case of disaster and drought. 
</P>
<P>
 "As recently as the Jan. 17 earthquake we had a situation when Metropolitan 
cut our water deliveries in half for about a day," said city Public Services 
Director Dan Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 The water issue runs deep in the city. Those who supported an annexation 
attempt by Los Angeles 70 years ago reputedly left bottles of foul-smelling 
well water, ostensibly from Beverly Hills, on residents' doorsteps with labels 
that said in part: "Drink sparingly, as it has laxative qualities." 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation drive failed, however, and Beverly Hills had its own water 
until the 1970s, when officials switched to the Metropolitan Water District 
rather than undertake what they said would be a costly project to modernize the 
city system. 
</P>
<P>
 If the test well shows that the underground water is of good quality and 
volume, the City Council could decide to have six more wells dug and a water 
treatment plant built in what is known as the Industrial Area. The wells would 
supply about a quarter of the city's water needs, with the remainder coming 
from the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster assured residents who recalled the foul-smelling water of the past 
that the treatment plant would purify the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The test well will cost $472,438 and take three to four months to construct. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected that local water can be produced more cheaply than MWD-provided 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metropolitan has embarked on a $6-billion capital project with a $500-million 
annual debt service, so we can expect to see their rates rise proportionately," 
Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water rates over the next 15 years are expected to increase at least 1% to 
1.5% a year, not counting inflation, said MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski. He said 
the agency has generally supported independence efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the $12-million plan, the test well would be converted 
to a full-production well. An additional well would be constructed on Burton 
Way, and five more are proposed for Beverly Gardens park, which runs along 
Santa Monica Boulevard. Beverly Gardens would not be damaged by the wells, 
Webster said in response to worries voiced by some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A sound enclosure was erected on the Burton Way median Tuesday, surrounding 
the construction equipment as the well is drilled. The acoustical barrier will 
be removed after the drilling. The pumping will not be disruptive to nearby 
residents, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sign of the well above ground, according to engineers, will be three 
utility cabinets, each four to five feet high, near the well on the median 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the City Council asked the Public Works Commission to look into the 
possibility of re-establishing local water wells. The following year, the 
Newport Beach firm of Boyle Engineering was commissioned to make preliminary 
studies of the ground water beneath Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, the Public Works Commission recommended that the test well 
be drilled before the city spent millions of dollars to set up its own water 
supply. Boyle Engineering was authorized to design and operate the test well.

MOBILE NEEDLE EXCHANGE NEAR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Jerry Schneiderman, a Hollywood real estate developer, it's bad enough what 
goes on inside the Ford Bronco: a needle exchange program run by social service 
volunteers hoping to halt the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's worse, he and other business people believe, is where the 
once-a-week exchange occurs: across the street from Selma Elementary School, 
near the corner of Selma and Cherokee avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the height of stupidity," fumed Schneiderman, a member of the 
Hollywood Property Owners Assn. board of trustees. "To set up a location for 
drug users to come that's in front of an elementary school . . . that's 
insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, say supporters of the 6-month-old program, who deem the mobile needle 
exchange as not only a responsible way to combat AIDS infection, but also an 
effective means of bringing drug users into rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood has attracted problem kids and runaway kids for 50 years," said 
Roxana Tynan, community advocate for Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, whose 
district includes Hollywood. "They're going to be here whether there are 
services or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the program, drug users can get clean syringes -- along with items 
such as distilled water, bleach and condoms -- after they turn in their dirty 
needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the concept of needle exchanges has received the support of the City 
Council and the mayor's office, Tynan said, technically the practice is still 
illegal in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the bigger issue is where the needle exchanges have occurred. 
Though it takes place only on Wednesdays from 6 to 9 p.m., Schneiderman said 
those who use the service stay in the area to take drugs after they get their 
clean needles. Usually, more than 200 syringes are turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hang around the school because that (area is) where they get free 
needles and free services," said Schneiderman, who would rather such exchanges 
be done at the offices of social agencies. "Why should they go anywhere else?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Tynan said the site is well-placed. Within half a block of Selma and 
Cherokee, she said, there are four social service agencies, including the Teen 
Canteen and the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Tynan said, no one at Selma Elementary School, including teachers, 
children and parents, has complained about the exchange or reported any 
problems arising from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's after school hours, it doesn't impact the school," said Selma 
Elementary School Principal Doris Dent.

BRIEFLY; MEDICINE: HIV PATIENTS TO TEST CANCER MEDICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA's Center for AIDS Research and Education (CARE) is seeking HIV-positive 
subjects with Kaposi's sarcoma skin lesions to take part in a clinical trial of 
a medication to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, the most common cancer found in people 
with AIDS. 
</P>

 The usual treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma involves injections of various drugs 
into individual skin tumors. The medication being tested in the UCLA trial, 
LGD1057, is a gel that patients can apply themselves.

BUSINESS; AIR COURIER TAKES HOLLYWOOD TO THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven years ago, Christine Jerry-Storey started an air courier service with a 
small Venice office, a pickup truck and a $10,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, her business, Midnite Express, is an $18 million-a-year, 24-hour-a-day 
enterprise with offices in New York, London, Paris, Sydney and -- by the end of 
the year -- Hong Kong. It ranks as the 11th largest female-owned business in 
Los Angeles County, according to the Los Angeles Business Journal. And 
Jerry-Storey is a nominee for one of Inc. magazine's annual Entrepreneur of the 
Year awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret? 
</P>
<P>
 Making deliveries for movie studios and record companies -- anytime, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never say never; we never say no," says Jerry-Storey, who is president and 
majority shareholder of Midnite Express. Her husband, Keith Storey, is chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Midnite Express has about 150 employees working out of its headquarters, now 
in Inglewood, but getting the job done sometimes means that the Storeys must 
take to the air themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Corbett, manager of traffic and shipping for the Motion Picture 
Marketing Division of Paramount Studios, remembers one such occasion. With only 
a couple of hours notice, Keith Storey traveled from Los Angeles to Australia, 
hand-carrying T-shirts promoting "Crocodile Dundee II." 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Keith and Christine at the airport, we stuffed the T-shirts into empty 
suitcases . . . and he jumped onto the plane at the last minute," Corbett says. 
</P>
<P>
 Making domestic and international business deliveries for all of the Hollywood 
studios and major record labels is Midnite Express' bread and butter. But the 
company also serves as a personal delivery service for some of the industry's 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat socks, a jogging suit and pizza are among the specially requested items 
that the company has rushed to celebrities in locations around the world.  
</P>
<P>
 "One time we delivered a bottle of perfume to Paris, which I thought was a 
little odd. . . . I think it was Giorgio of Beverly Hills," Keith Storey says. 
(Storey declined to say who has placed such orders, saying he is concerned that 
it might damage the company's relations with its clients.) 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, a Midnite Express courier spent New Year's Eve in Chile 
after hand-delivering a prescreened copy of "Alive" to the real-life survivors 
of the plane crash depicted in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 More typical deliveries for Midnite Express are movie "standees," which are 
cardboard advertising cutouts, and posters that decorate the lobbies of movie 
theaters around the world. These days, the loading docks at Midnite Express are 
piled high with cardboard cartons filled with stuffed animals and marked 
"Flintstones,"while other long, flat boxes carry "Lassie" standees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't open a movie without these," says Nadia Bronson, vice president of 
international marketing for Universal Studios. "Every week we coordinate 
shipments through Midnite Express to more than 60 countries." 
</P>
<P>
 For the recent Cannes Film Festival, Midnite Express carried 40 delivery bags 
a day to France, each filled with promotional material and every shipment 
accompanied by a personal courier. One of these deliveries was 400 pounds of 
suntan lotion that Columbia Records needed in Cannes the next day for a 
promotional give-away. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping Midnite Express accommodate last-minute and odd-hour requests are 
agreements with domestic and international airlines that give the company 
preferential treatment in placing cargo aboard aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as a plane is flying and there is space on board, packages are on 
their way any time of the day or night. Despite airline employee strikes that 
have disrupted air service in recent years, Midnite Express has never missed 
getting a package on a plane, according to the company's top executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Express and other delivery companies that fly their own airplanes 
control costs by scheduling a limited number of flights through hub cities in 
their courier network. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plane has got to go and, when it goes, the day is over," confirms a 
spokesman for Federal Express, who asked not to be named. He adds that Federal 
Express has a "significant amount of clients in Hollywood," but that the 
delivery giant probably will never offer that is more customized than that of 
Midnite Express. 
</P>
<P>
 For delivery services, however, planes may soon become passe. Satellite 
transmission is the courier of the future, and it is a service that Midnite 
Express -- along with other companies -- recently started to offer. Such 
services have made it easier and cheaper for film production crews in remote 
locations to send "dailies," or raw footage, to their studios in analog form 
via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Dailies normally are couriered from a location shoot to the studio, which can 
delay a production for three or four days, says Nicholas Vincent, Midnite 
Express' chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Using some of Midnite Express' competitors, Steven Spielberg satellite-fed 
daily footage from "Jurassic Park" to his location in Poland, where he was 
working on "Schindler's List."

BRIEFLY; PRESERVATION: 2 AWARDS GO TO CULVER CITY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The restored Ivy Substation in Culver City has won awards from two major 
preservation organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation, which once distributed electrical power for local rail 
service, won the Los Angeles Conservancy's 1994 Conservancy Preservation Award. 
It was cited for "exemplary completed rehabilitation" in this year's awards 
presentation by the City of Los Angeles' Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1907, the Ivy Substation is the only remaining unaltered substation 
built by the Los Angeles Pacific Co. Renovated at a cost of $2 million for the 
Culver City Redevelopment Agency, it now serves as a community center and 
houses a community theater. The restoration project was managed by Tishman 
Construction Corp.

COMMUNITY NEWS: FAIRFAX; D-DAY REALITY COMES ALIVE FOR ROTC CADET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To 17-year-old Charles Butler, generations removed from World War II, D-day 
was something that lived only on a page in a history book. 
</P>
<P>
 But after touring England earlier this month and taking part in events 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-day, Butler says the massive military 
offensive mounted by Allied forces on June 6, 1944, lives in him now. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people lost their family and friends," said Butler, a Southwest Los 
Angeles resident and Hamilton High student. "They stood around me crying. . . . 
It's very real for them -- like it happened yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was one of 24 ROTC naval cadets from the American Southwest chosen by 
ROTC officials to make the two-week trip earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The group traveled to several English ports from which the invasion of France 
was launched, saw President Clinton and French President Francois Mitterand at 
D-day events and heard testimonies -- many of them eyewitness accounts of the 
battle that turned the tide of the war in Europe. One veteran told Butler he 
parachuted into the wrong spot, about 20 miles north of the appointed place on 
the Normandy beach in France. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the cadets performed military drills for such royalty as the Queen 
Mother and Prince Philip, they were getting the red-carpet treatment from the 
British. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Butler, the only African American in his group: "They saw us as 
diplomatic guests, even though we're young. It was kind of a shock to come back 
here and be treated like a kid again."  
</P>
<P>
 Butler and the cadets stayed on the Bristol, a British destroyer, and toured 
Southampton and London. 
</P>
<P>
 But Butler said the most enduring experience will be honoring D-day. "If it 
wasn't for D-day," he said, "the Germans might have won the war. And the world 
would be a very different place today." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; COUNCIL ADOPTS BUDGET WITH $339,720 SURPLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday adopted a $7.6-million budget that includes a 
surplus of $339,720. 
</P>
<P>
 The city anticipates revenues of about $7.9 million for the fiscal year that 
begins July 1, $339,720 over expected expenditures, which will be about 
$300,000 more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although disasters such as winter storms and last November's wildfires and a 
decrease in revenue from sales and utility taxes took their toll on the budget, 
the city managed to cut costs by eliminating an administrative assistant 
position and by replacing contract services with five salaried employees for 
its public works and building services' departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget revenues were also bolstered by a $1.1-million payment from Los Angeles 
County, a windfall from the settlement of a 1992 lawsuit the city had filed 
over miscalculation of property tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, which includes no new or increased services, was presented to the 
council after Finance Director Mark Lorimer explained the erroneous addition of 
nearly $1 million in nonexistent cash reserves to the city's budget over the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorimer told the council that he had committed the error two years ago when he 
used a projected number for the fund balance, instead of actual figures from a 
1991-92 budget audit. That discrepancy was carried over from last year's fund 
balance to this year's balance, but Lorimer said that there was no real money 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsatisfied with Lorimer's explanation, Mayor Jeff Kramer has asked city 
auditor Peat Marwick to review the matter. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: LEIMERT PARK; LOAN PROGRAM AIMS TO SPUR HOME OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In front of a tree-shaded home on 3rd Avenue in Leimert Park, what Councilman 
Mark Ridley-Thomas called prime real estate, city officials and financiers 
announced a home loan program designed to increase home ownership in the inner 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give deserving people the chance to buy a decent new place to 
live," said Ridley-Thomas, who spent a year coordinating the program, called 
Home Works! 
</P>
<P>
 "For too long, people have associated affordable housing with rental units and 
projects. We need to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 The city-sponsored program gets its $100 million in loan capital from Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Three financial institutions -- Countrywide Funding Corp., First Interstate 
Bank and Family Savings Bank -- will originate and underwrite the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying low- and middle-income home buyers will be able to finance up to 
95% of a home purchase, as well as take out interest-free loans for 
rehabilitation and home improvement through the city's Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas, who chairs the City Council's Housing and Redevelopment 
Committee, said the program will help ensure that the economic foundation of 
the community -- home ownership -- is strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some inner city areas have deteriorated, he noted, South-Central was 
one of the few areas in California where property values have increased over 
the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to see neighborhoods on the edge not fall over, we must have 
programs like this one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home Works! will help not only first-time buyers, but homeowners who may be 
facing foreclosure and need help," he said. 
</P>
<P>

FOR SENIORS; LINDA FELDMAN; OLYMPIAN IS A TOP FINISHER IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some force must be watching over Louie Zamperini. Not because he was an angel. 
Quite the opposite. He endured -- and raised -- his share of hell. But 
Zamperini, 77, has come through it with his spirit intact. And what a life! 
From bad boy to Olympic athlete to being given up for dead in a prisoner of war 
camp to serving God. 
</P>
<P>
 His family was forced to leave upstate New York because doctors warned that 
Louie, then 2 years old, and his older brother would die of pneumonia if they 
stayed. They settled in Long Beach and a few weeks later their house burned 
down. His father, blinded by smoke, mistakenly grabbed a pillow thinking he was 
rescuing the boy. The father went back into the house and found the boy huddled 
under the bed barely breathing. Two years later Louie hid under the bed again 
when a boy who had challenged him to a race ran in front of a car and was 
killed before Louie's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky he beat me," Zamperini, now a counselor, said from his 
memorabilia-filled office at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The family moved to Torrance, and Louie started breaking the rules. It was a 
common sight to see Louie walking to kindergarten smoking cigarette butts that 
he picked up from the street.  
</P>
<P>
 Zamperini graduated to stealing pies and, later, beer during Prohibition days. 
No amount of beatings from school principals or his father could stifle his 
curiosity and his need for adventure. By the time he entered high school, he 
was undisciplined and getting into more trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletics helped people in those days," he said. "I was 15, smoking and 
drinking, and my brother got me into track. The first time I ran I came in 
last. But I heard kids screaming my name in the stands -- 'C'mon Louie' -- and 
I didn't know that anyone knew my name. That did it for me. The recognition 
tasted good." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamperini did his own brand of training. He went from maverick to track 
fanatic. He ran 12 miles a day. He took fifth place in Los Angeles' All-City 
finals. He broke the national high school record for the mile, a feat that was 
his entree to the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't good enough to compete in the mile so I switched to the 5,000 meter. 
But on the ship going to Germany I gained 14 pounds. The advice we got in those 
days was no gravy, no pork and no women. That left everything else. There 
wasn't enough time to lose the weight so I couldn't keep up with the pace," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamperini competed in the 5,000 anyway and finished eighth but he did the last 
quarter mile in 56 seconds. He impressed the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the race, a group of us were being photographed. I was introduced to 
Hitler and Hitler said, "Oh, the boy with the fast finish," and he extended his 
flimsy hand and shook mine. I didn't think anything of it," he said. After the 
Olympics he went to USC and broke the collegiate record for the mile. He was 
preparing for the 1940 Olympics when war broke out in Europe. He volunteered 
for the Air Force and became a bombardier. Everything in his life prepared him 
for what would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane he was flying in developed engine trouble and went down in the 
Pacific. He blacked out as it fell, but his Trojan ring caught on the window 
latch and he was able to struggle out as the plane sunk in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense told him to get the raft that was floating away. He brought it 
back to where the crew was. Eight crew members died on impact and three boarded 
the raft. "We prayed because we looked at logic -- no food and no water -- and 
felt we had a better chance with divine intervention. We caught fish, birds and 
ate shark livers. We got into the water and hung up to our necks -- the theory 
being that we wouldn't dehydrate if we stayed in water," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The prayer for water produced a tropical storm and after 27 days they had 
water to drink. After 47 days they saw land and the Japanese saw the two crew 
members that remained. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamperini weighed 60 pounds. He was placed in a cell the size of a large dog 
kennel. He spent the next 2 1/2 years in a series of Japanese prison camps, 14 
months in solitary. He was officially declared dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was on that raft, I made thousands of promises. The most important one 
was that I would seek and serve God. But after the war, I didn't keep one. I 
got married. There was no hunger, no explosions, no concentration camp. I went 
back to my drinking habits. Lost a lot of money in bad business deals. My wife 
was going to divorce me but her last hope was bringing me to hear Billy 
Graham." 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1953 and he has been serving people ever since. Today, Zamperini 
lectures to young people about survival and to seniors about self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamperini gives the same message to the old and the young: Do the best you 
can; always try to improve spiritually.

INGLEWOOD; COUNCIL OKS HOLLYWOOD PARK CARD CLUB; OFFICIALS LINK THE CASINO TO 
THE CITY'S FINANCIAL SALVATION. THEY PREDICT $4 MILLION IN REVENUES THE FIRST 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Hailing the Hollywood Park card club as the fiscal savior of Inglewood, the 
City Council voted Tuesday to issue a license to the club, which officials 
expect will contribute about $4 million in taxes to the city for fiscal year 
1994-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're elated to issue this license," said Mayor Edward Vincent before the 
vote. "That card club saves us all -- it saves the residents of Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office gave two former National Football League 
executives, Don Klosterman and Eddie LeBaron, preliminary permission last week 
to run the club. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had counted on having $4 million from the card club to balance 
its budget, and the casino's planned July 1 opening date means that Inglewood 
should make at least that much in taxes, said City Manager Paul D. Eckles.

 "We put that budget together a few months ago when we didn't have as good an 
idea of when the opening would actually be," Eckles said. "But now that $4 
million becomes really tangible. It makes me feel confident that that's a 
realistic number." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said the city's deficit occurred because state and federal funds the 
city typically receives dried up during the recession.  
</P>
<P>
 Eckles has estimated that the card club eventually could contribute $10 
million a year to Inglewood's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prospect of $4 million from the club plugged into the city's 
finances, the council voted Tuesday to accept a $55-million budget for fiscal 
year 1994-1995 that does not expand city programs but contains no layoffs. The 
council is scheduled to vote on the budget next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I propose to do is watch the card club open and see how it does before 
increasing . . . the budget," Eckles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-table card club, which will include Asian games, is scheduled to be 
open around the clock, seven days a week. It is to be located in the track's 
Cary Grant Pavilion, along with retail shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park has hired about 1,500 people to work as dealers, security 
guards and cooks in the casino restaurant. In the last year, about 6,300 people 
have applied for jobs at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The card club project has led to talks about reopening the Airport Park Hotel 
and building a 16,000-seat amphitheater, and it has renewed interest from 
development companies in revitalizing the Market Street-La Brea shopping 
district, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, Hollywood Park made a deal with Klosterman, who was general 
manager of the Los Angeles Rams in the 1970s, and LeBaron, a former Washington 
Redskins and Dallas Cowboys quarterback and an executive for the Atlanta 
Falcons in the 1980s, allowing them to run the club, if the partners would pay 
the racetrack $3 million a month in a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the state attorney general's office uncovers financial troubles or 
concerns with their backgrounds during a routine investigation, Klosterman and 
LeBaron will be granted a permanent gambling license by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some loose ends with regard to their background and the financial 
aspects, but generally those issues are pretty minimal," said Debbie Wiley, 
chief of the attorney general's gaming registration unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the big picture when we do this and try to have a comfort level 
with the applicants, and we already have that," Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The card club suffered several major setbacks before finally gaining state 
approval.  
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature approved a bill that would have allowed Hollywood Park to run 
the card club, but Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed it. He agreed with Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren, who opposes licensing clubs owned by unknown stockholders because the 
state does not have a full-time investigative commission to oversee gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The city then found investors, including Edward Allred, a partner in the Los 
Alamitos Race Course, to run the club, and it was scheduled to open in January. 
But the attorney general's office refused to issue a license on the grounds 
that Allred previously owned stock in out-of-state gambling businesses.

YARDS OF ADVICE; HOME IMPROVEMENT: RENTAL YARDS OFFER DO-IT-YOURSELF HOMEOWNERS 
TOOLS THEY MAY BE UNAWARE OF AND TIPS ON HOW TO USE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Morell is a Woodland Hills free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Glickman knew there had to be a better way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana homeowner recently took on a formidable home improvement project 
-- removing old linoleum tile to lay down a wood floor in the kitchen -- and 
realized he was getting nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with chisels, putty knives and solvent, prying up the tiles was 
incredibly difficult work. After four hours Glickman had only removed about 10 
square feet. On the advice of a neighbor, he ventured into a local rental yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They showed me an electric stripper that would do the job in a fraction of 
the time," Glickman said. "It cost me $50 to rent it for the day, but it was 
worth every penny. I was close to giving up on the job and hiring someone to 
finish it, which would have cost even more." 
</P>
<P>
 The local rental yard is perhaps one of the most underused resources for 
do-it-yourself homeowners. A 1990 Gallup study showed that fewer than one-third 
of homeowners have ever rented equipment, and most are unaware of the range of 
tools available and what they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always have people coming in looking to rent a truck or buy propane, and 
they're amazed at all the other things they can get," said Pat Cable of Doug's 
U-Rent in Woodland Hills. "Many have driven by us for years, and that's the 
first time they stopped in." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the American Rental Assn., the most common tools and equipment 
rented by homeowners include rug cleaning and treatment machines, rototillers, 
chain saws, compressors, plumbing snakes and ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally a hangout for contractors seeking extra equipment for a job, 
rental yards offer the average homeowner the ability to cheaply use a unique 
tool or piece of equipment that would be too expensive to buy, as well as 
advice on how to complete the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a good rental yard, the entire staff knows how to use the equipment as 
well as a contractor (does)," Cable said. "People will often come in planning 
to re-landscape and they'll want a rototiller. But I always ask them if they've 
watered their soil down for four days and let it dry out for three. Without the 
right preparation, they'll have a hard time tilling the soil; so part of what 
we do is education." 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving advice is part of the business," said Brett Turley of GKN Rentals, 
which has 20 outlets throughout Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties. "If 
we can help the customer do the job right, he or she won't abuse the equipment, 
they'll finish quickly and we'll be able to turn it around and rent it out 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a good rental yard may mean asking for recommendations from neighbors 
or just dropping by and visiting one. "Take a look at the equipment to see what 
condition it's in," said Russ Meek of Economy Rentals in East Los Angeles. "And 
see how helpful the employees are. If everything is dirty and rusty or if no 
one seems interested in giving you hand, check somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, a visit to a rental yard can seem a little daunting. "It 
could be intimidating," Cable said. "Especially if you're attempting a big 
project for the first time and you're not sure what you're in for." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some people don't take advantage of the knowledge of the 
rental-yard staff. "We'll always get someone who acts like they know what 
they're doing, although they may not feel comfortable asking how a tool works; 
then they'll call later and say the equipment's not working," Cable said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the experts, the best way to use a rental yard is to forget about 
trying to tally up the equipment you'll have to get for a home improvement 
project. Take a good look at what you'll be trying to do and consult with the 
yard staff to figure out what you'll need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a good idea of what your project is going to be," Meek said. "If you're 
going to be putting up new kitchen cabinets, will you be removing the old 
wallpaper around them? If you're looking to rent a compressor and some air 
tools, will you be needing extension cords? We always have a supply of scratch 
paper at the desk where customers can sketch out their projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the popularity of plumbing snakes that are used to open clogged 
drain pipes, Meek has charts of common household drainage systems to help 
customers identify the kind of snake they'll need for their clog. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone says they want a particular tool, we always ask about their 
job," Meek said. "A customer may ask for a chain saw, then we learn that he's 
planning on removing stumps. For safety reasons, you shouldn't use a chain saw 
close to the ground, you'll need a stump grinder, which does a better job. So 
we try to give them the tool and the guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 For a project that's hard to describe, it may be wise to pull out a camera in 
order to take pictures to the yard. "When a customer brings a photograph of 
what they're attempting to do, that's a big help," Cable said. "I can point out 
exactly what tools they'll need, how to use them and how much time the job will 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 When you learn what you'll need and examine the tools and equipment, taking 
notes will help you do the job right. "As you're shown step by step how to 
start the motor, how to hold the tool, write down the instructions," Cable 
suggested. "Ask the employee to start the equipment, and make sure you can use 
it before you leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Although anyone can rent a large or exotic construction tool, you may not be 
able to take home that backhoe as planned. "If the customer has never operated 
a sophisticated piece of equipment, we're not going to let them just jump on 
and take it away," Turley said. "If they don't have the strength or knowledge 
to use the tool, we'll help them find other ways to complete their project." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the tool, rentals can be arranged by the hour, day, week or 
month. When you describe your project, the staff should be able to help you 
estimate how long you'll need the tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Many rental yards offer a delivery service that will bring large pieces of 
equipment directly to a job site. At most yards, you must leave a credit card 
or cash deposit before renting and sign a rental agreement that states that 
you'll pay if you damage the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why it's important to look it over and see that it works," Cable said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides renting tools and giving advice for a project, many yard managers find 
they're also trying to sell some confidence. "If I can help a homeowner tackle 
a project successfully by himself, he'll visit me again," Meek said. "That's 
why I want to give him all the help I can." Types of Equipment for Rent 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a range of rental equipment rates available in the Los Angeles area: 
</P>
<P>
 10-inch tile saw: $50-$64 per day. 16-inch chain saw: $9-$12 per hour, $35-$45 
per day. 24-foot extension ladder: $19-$25 per day. 30-foot electric snake: 
$5-$10 per hour, $27-$35 per day. 50-foot extension cord: $5-$10 per day. 
Electric door planer: $19-$25 per day. Electric tile stripper: $10-$15 per 
hour, $48-$60 per day. Lawn aerator: $10-$15 per hour, $40-$55 per day. Lawn 
mower: $5-$10 per hour, $25-$40 per day. Portable gas-powered compressors: 
$70-$110 per day. Rototiller: $45-$105 per day. Staple gun: $7-$12 per day.

YOUR MORTGAGE; LENDERS HELP AVOID FORECLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by the Washington Post 
Writers Group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're four months behind on your mortgage payments -- more than $4,000 in the 
hole -- because your spouse was laid off. The phone rings and it's the mortgage 
company again. 
</P>
<P>
 But the message this time borders on the incredible: 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of threats of foreclosure, your lender offers to pay a big chunk of 
what you owe, in hard cash. Even better, it will refinance you to a lower rate 
that you can afford with your diminished income. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound too good to be true? Not for participants in a little-publicized but 
highly significant series of pilot programs now under way. The results are so 
encouraging, says the large mortgage company sponsoring it, that the concept is 
likely to go nationwide soon, and could become a new industry standard in 
borrower-lender relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even consumer advocates are praising the idea. Gale Cincotta, a Chicago-based 
community activist, said, "This is really important. Even if you run into 
trouble, your lender doesn't have to be the bad guy who's going to take your 
home away." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what's happening. Hundreds of delinquent borrowers in seven large 
metropolitan areas are being screened by PNC Mortgage -- formerly Sears 
Mortgage Corp. -- to see whether they fit into its fledgling "Safe at Home" 
financial assistance program. PNC is the country's eighth-largest mortgage 
originator, and services more than 460,000 home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 If a borrower has maintained a relatively good payment record for several 
years but suddenly gets hit with an "unforeseen circumstance" -- a divorce, 
death of a spouse, a plant closing or even a natural disaster -- PNC may step 
in with a one-time-only dose of financial relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case this spring of a Baltimore couple in their late 30s. The husband 
and wife had closed on a home mortgage of $106,350 in 1990 at 10% interest. 
Monthly principal, interest and impound payments came to $1,075. Last year, 
however, the couple ran into financial trouble because of an employment change. 
They just couldn't handle all the bills coming due on their diminished monthly 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 They missed a couple of mortgage payments, and got the predictable warnings 
from their lender, PNC. Ultimately they fell five months behind. But rather 
than force them out of their house, PNC made them a shocking offer: 
</P>
<P>
 Come up with about $2,000 of the $5,000-plus that you are in arrears, and 
we'll chip in the rest. We'll also do a professional inspection of your home -- 
free -- and put you into a whole new loan carrying an 8 1/2% rate and a $961 
monthly payment that we know you have the income to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 All the borrowers had to do was fill out an application and attend a homeowner 
financial counseling session of several hours run by a Baltimore nonprofit 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar refinancing arrangements have been negotiated this spring in Los 
Angeles, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Atlanta, Boston and Chicago. The essential 
ingredients are the same: If homeowners facing imminent foreclosure can be kept 
from such a disaster through the investment of two or three thousand dollars, 
then it a worthwhile expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because foreclosure not only hurts the consumer, it's also costly to the 
lender as well -- often racking up thousands of dollars in losses and fees in 
connection with the transaction. Though many foreclosures can't be prevented -- 
the owners have no real prospects of handling their debt loads even at reduced 
monthly payments -- others simply need to be thrown a lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a win-win type of situation," said Walter C. Klein, chairman 
and CEO of Vernon Hills, Ill.-based PNC Mortgage. The homeowners keep their 
property, on renegotiated terms. And PNC cures delinquencies that could lose 
the company substantial sums. On top of that, Klein said, "the entire local 
community wins" because the house involved doesn't get sold at a bargain price 
on the courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program was developed with the help of a nonprofit, consumer-oriented 
group -- the Illinois Public Action Housing Policy Center -- and has been 
strongly endorsed by Cincotta's organization, the National Training and 
Information Center (NTIC). The latter group works with consumer housing 
counseling agencies across the country, primarily in urban communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of PNC's biggest hurdles in initiating its concept was rampant 
disbelief among its own clients that a private lender would offer them cash 
when they were seriously delinquent on their loans. PNC employees would call 
prospective beneficiaries several times without getting responses, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd leave messages explaining what we wanted to do and you could just hear 
what (the customers) were saying: 'Yeah, sure, you want to give us money -- 
there's gotta be a gimmick. This couldn't be (the mortgage company) whose calls 
we've been avoiding all these months.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the program headed? Currently limited to qualified PNC customers in 
the seven pilot markets, it's expected to expand nationwide to the firm's 
460,000 borrower base in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 And beyond that? Consumer advocates like Cincotta hope other major lenders 
will adopt it. Even if they're not attuned to the social benefits, she said, 
"They should understand the payoff at the bottom line."

ESTATE PLANNING MAKES SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betty Lukas' excellent article on charitable remainder trusts ("Trust Provides 
Donors Income, Tax Benefits for Generosity," May 22) omitted one outstanding 
alternative that is available to insurable donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The donor can set up a separate wealth replacement (life insurance) trust 
naming the children as beneficiaries.The donor can pay the premiums from a 
portion of the income from the CRT or use some of the income generated from the 
tax deductions they'll receive as a result of the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Through insurance, this special trust can replace all or a portion of the 
value of the property donated. When the last donor dies the children will 
receive cash from the insurance proceeds (tax free) because it is not part of 
the decedents estate.

 Your recent articles on estate planning were the best written and most useful 
articles I have seen on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 I've gone to seminars, lectures, workshops and tried to read books on the 
subject. None of those gave me a focus or a plan to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading the first article I felt directed to a family limited 
partnership (FLIP), and I awaited the last article. I am finally on the road to 
doing something -- a FLIP, which until reading the articles, I had never known 
existed.

FIRST TIMERS CAN TURN TO CREDIT UNIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems that each week you receive horror stories regarding mortgage 
lenders.This was painfully apparent in the stories by your first-time buyers 
("First Timers' Tales," May 22). 
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to offer an alternate: credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many credit unions now offer full-service real estate lending programs at 
extremely reasonable fees. Our rates are competitive with the larger mortgage 
lenders. And most of all, we offer our members a relationship based on lasting 
service and respect.

WATCH YOUR PS AND QS WHEN REPLACING PVC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a professional property inspector in Southern California for 
several years. I read some dangerous advice given in your April 24, 1994 
"Handyman Q&A" column and would like (to) offer some information to your 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was: I'm replacing some bad sections of copper pipe. Can I use 
PVC pipe for the repairs? 
</P>
<P>
 The column answer simply described connection methods, never bringing up the 
fact that the repairs would probably not meet the building code requirements 
and may in fact create a severe electrical hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 As the question was relating to copper pipe, one must assume the lines in 
question were for the potable plumbing supply system. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) 
is not an approved material by the Uniform Plumbing Code or any municipality 
that I am aware of, for pressurized systems within the building. This includes 
lines located in crawl spaces and attics. PVC is generally accepted for use as 
supply for irrigation systems and potable supply outside the building's 
framework. In all likelihood the repairs in question would be in a location 
where PVC is not accepted, so if you were to follow the advice of the column, 
you would be performing a "nonconforming" or "improper" repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, and most important, a large percentage of homes use the potable 
plumbing supply system as the grounding source in the electrical system. A 
home's grounding system is generally the most important component of the system 
as it is designed to protect the occupants from electrical shock. PVC is made 
of plastic, even in approved locations, can eliminate the grounding source, 
thus creating a potential electrical hazard of lethal proportions.

DON'T DECEIVE AGENTS ABOUT GETTING LISTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a realtor on the Westside of Los Angeles and I take exception to a piece 
of advice offered by Robert J. Bruss on Sunday, June 5. 
</P>
<P>
 A seller wrote: " . . . I invited the realty agent who sold us our home 12 
years ago to come over and make fix-up suggestions."Within this context is the 
assumption that this seller has loyalty to this agent over the 12 years and 
will be using this agent to sell his or her home. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Bruss' response, he states: " . . . before signing a listing with 
that agent, be sure to interview at least two additional agents." "Compare 
those suggested prices with the first agent's recommendation to be sure you 
don't list your home below its market value." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of interviewing several agents for the sole purpose of obtaining 
second and third opinions, while at the same time knowing whom the listing will 
be going to, is unfair, deceptive and inconsiderate of the agents' time. 
</P>
<P>
 If the seller only wants second opinions, he or she should be up front with 
the agents. I would have no qualm of giving a seller a second opinion if I were 
told up front that that is all I am doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, I find it odd that a seller has loyalty to a particular agent 
after 12 years, but yet would not have complete confidence in that agent's 
recommendations. After all, the recommended listing price is not an arbitrary 
number, but rather is based on a written comparative market analysis. I would 
advise sellers not to deceive agents with false hopes of a listing. If a seller 
is loyal to a particular agent, but still feels the need for another opinion, 
he or she can always hire a licensed appraiser.

RENT WATCH: OWNER BILLS TENANT WHO PAINTED WITHOUT ASKING 
</P>

 QUESTION: My former tenant repainted my kitchen cabinets without permission. I 
didn't discover this until she moved out. Not only did she paint them a color 
that doesn't match the rest of the kitchen, she painted them with a cheap, 
non-washable paint, so that now the kitchen can't be kept clean from grease and 
dirt. The kitchen was freshly painted with a good quality washable paint just 
one year ago. I was counting on the paint lasting at least another year until I 
was ready to remodel the kitchen; however, in the meantime, I feel I should be 
able to bill her for repainting to match the rest of the kitchen. Am I 
justified in deducting this cost from her deposit? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Yes; if your tenant created a situation that caused a detriment to 
your property, she can be charged the cost of having the problem rectified. 
This is why most leases require written permission from the property owner 
before a tenant can make any changes to the property. If your tenant took it 
upon herself to paint in a color that doesn't match, and with an inferior 
quality paint, she brought on herself the possibility that she would be charged 
to correct it. Because she acted without your permission, you should be able to 
deduct the entire expense. No-Children Excuse Just Doesn't Wash 
</P>
<P>
 Q: An apartment manager just told my husband that he doesn't like to rent to 
families because children take too many baths. Our children are reasonably 
clean but certainly don't break any records for water use. Do you think that 
something else could be going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The apartment manager appears to be discriminating against families with 
children, and the excuse that he has chosen simply will not wash. General 
assumptions that children produce more noise, take more baths or do more damage 
to property than adults are base upon unfair stereotyping and cannot be used as 
pretexts for barring children from rental housing. Both state and federal laws 
guarantee that families with children will have an equal opportunity to rent 
the housing of their choice. For a referral to a fair housing agency that can 
offer you assistance, call (213) -- HOUSING. What to Do With Guest Who Stays 
Too Long? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A house guest lived with my tenants for several months before they moved 
out. After they moved, he remained on the property, and now he refuses to pay 
rent or vacate. How can I get back my property? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the rental agreement had a time-limit restriction for overnight guests, 
you could have made the former tenants responsible for removing the house 
guest. If you did not have a guest restriction, did not know about his presence 
or did not object to the guest's presence, he is now your tenant, and you must 
serve him either with a "Three-Day Notice To Pay Rent or Quit" or with a 
"Thirty-Day Notice of Termination of Tenancy." If he does not vacate, you can 
file a legal action for eviction in court. This action will probably result in 
a judgment that will force this person to move so that you can regain 
possession of your property. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent this situation in the future, your rental agreements should clearly 
define who your tenants are and what restrictions apply to their guests. If you 
need to initiate legal action, be sure to name all occupants of the rental 
property, even those not listed in the original rental agreement. This makes 
all occupants part of a single eviction process. Tenants should thoroughly 
understand all rental agreement provisions and should consult the landlord 
before taking action that may create a violation, and thereby, jeopardize their 
tenancy. It's Illegal to Refuse Tenant Needing Walker 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My grandfather, who has been partially disabled by a stroke, tried to rent 
an apartment. He was refused despite his excellent references, good credit and 
substantial pension income. The landlord was afraid that grandpa's walker might 
mar the walls or damage the door frames. Is it legal to refuse a disabled 
person for this reason? Would it help if we offered a larger deposit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: According to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, your grandfather 
cannot be denied housing just because his disability requires him to use a 
walker, wheelchair or other mobility aid. It is not legal for a landlord to 
require or accept a higher deposit to cover possible damage caused by a 
tenant's disability. After all, shopping carts, strollers and carelessly moved 
furniture can all potentially cause the same type of damage. If such damage 
does occur, a charge can be reasonably deducted from a normal security deposit 
at the end of the tenancy. There is no justification for rejecting a qualified 
renter simply because a landlord assumes he will cause more damage due to his 
disability. For assistance with this and other questions about the rights of 
disabled tenants in rental housing, contact your local fair housing agency or 
the regional office of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
office, at (800) 347-3739. Must 30-Day Notice Start on First of Month? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the middle of this month, I gave my landlord a 30-day notice that I was 
moving out. My landlord says that the 30-day notice can only be given on the 
first of the month, and that I will owe him rent until the end of the next 
month. I thought that a 30-day notice means just that -- 30 days after the 
notice is given. I had already made plans to move into a the new apartment in 
30 days, and I can't afford to pay rent to two landlords at one time. What 
should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Breathe easy. A 30-day notice to terminate a tenancy can be given either 
tenant or landlord any time during the month, as stated in California Civil 
Code Section 1946. Actually, the 30-day period starts the day after the notice 
is given. If you gave your landlord the notice on June 15, count 30 days 
starting with June 16. This means that your obligation to pay rent ends on July 
15. If Damaged Door Is Upgraded, Who Pays? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently moved out of an apartment, and during the move, the front door 
was damaged. It was a hollow-core door, and now the landlord wants to charge me 
for a $300 solid-core door. Can the landlord charge me for this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your landlord's decision to upgrade the door is his choice, and he is not 
entitled to pass this cost on to you. You are not obligated to pay for 
improvements to the dwelling. Tell your landlord that you are willing to pay 
the cost of a replacement hollow-core door, but nothing more. If you are unable 
to resolve this matter, contact your local housing mediation program for 
assistance. Should 30-Year Friends Still Sign Agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am moving into the home of a good friend. We have known each other for 
nearly 30 years, and I know that we will get along. My daughter is encouraging 
me to get a signed rental agreement before I move in. This seems awkward 
because I am sure that my friend and I will get along very well without a 
formal agreement. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your daughter is giving you good advice. A written agreement can prevent 
problems in the future. You have been good friends for many years, but you have 
not shared living space before. Also, friends usually feel they are on equal 
footing, but undeniably you are stepping into a tenant/landlord relationship. 
Both you and your friend will most likely have some definite ideas of how this 
relationship should function, and it is best to put it in writing. This 
agreement need not be set down in "legalese." It just needs to be clear, 
complete, and agreed to -- that is, signed -- by both of you. Your local 
housing counseling program should be able to help the two of you write an 
agreement.

 Q: The tennis court at our condo is not accessible to my husband, who is in a 
wheelchair and is a tennis player. Can we force the association to make it 
accessible? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Experts say that there may not be a clear-cut answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and 
Housing Act protect people with disabilities. The California law states 
discrimination may be involved when there is "refusal to make reasonable 
accommodations in rules, practices, policies or services when these 
accommodations may be necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity 
to use and enjoy a dwelling." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Earl Sullaway, deputy director of the state Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing, a condo may be viewed as a business, and therefore may 
also be regulated by the Americans With Disabilities Act, which also requires 
accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Discrimination includes the refusal to make reasonable modifications to 
buildings that aren't currently accessible to the disabled, according to 
Sullaway. However, "the concept of reasonable accommodations comes in at some 
point," Sullaway said. "If they have to tear up the whole tennis court, they 
(the association) could argue that is unreasonable. . . . But if all it takes 
is widening the gate, then why not?"

GARDENING Q&A: HOW YOU CAN GROW LARGER, SWEETER GRAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Is it true that snipping off the bottom of each bunch of developing 
grapes will make the fruit larger and sweeter? If so, how much do I take off, 
and does it pertain to all varieties? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: In home gardens it is possible to obtain larger, sweeter fruit on some 
grape varieties by removing the lower one-third to one-half of each cluster as 
soon as grapes begin forming in spring. Although home-grown grapes rarely can 
achieve the size of commercially produced ones, the varieties that respond most 
favorably to this treatment are Thompson Seedless, Perlette, Cardinal and Ruby 
Seedless (King's Ruby). It's a little late to do it this season, but if done 
immediately you might still obtain sweeter fruit. What to Do About 'Tobacco 
Budworm' 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything that can be done to control or eradicate the "Tobacco 
budworm" that is destroying my geraniums and petunias? I've given up on them. 
</P>
<P>
 A: This ubiquitous caterpillar can be quite a nuisance, but two products give 
hope to the gardener. One is a chemical spray called Sevin. According to 
Sunset, Sevin is "reasonably safe to use" and "is a champion at killing chewing 
insects, but . . . it (also) kills honeybees and numerous (insect) parasites 
and predators." 
</P>
<P>
 A popular alternative is Bacillus thuringiensis, sold sometimes as B.T., 
Dipel, Thuricide and Biotrol. This product "contains bacteria that destroy 
digestive processes in caterpillars (so they stop eating and eventually starve 
to death); it is harmless otherwise," according to Sunset's researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both will work, so maybe now you can finally enjoy your geraniums and 
petunias. How to Control 'Rust' on Rose Leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Q: For three years I have battled "rust" on my roses. Fungicide spray helps 
some, but isn't there any means of controlling this disease? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Rust is a very annoying fungal disease that causes a reddish powder to form 
on the underside of rose leaves, usually in the springtime. Infected plants 
look sickly, and flowers are of inferior quality. Spores of this fungus are 
airborne and ever present. They become active when night temperatures are cool, 
day temperatures are fairly warm and the air is most. Some varieties of roses 
are more susceptible to this disease than others and, where conditions are 
right, will almost always get the disease first. Then from these plants the 
infection may spread to others nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Spraying every four to seven days with Benomyl, from early March through 
mid-June, helps but does not solve the problem; and it is an impractical 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately there is no magic wand to wave and make the problem go away 
completely. However, here are some fairly simple solutions, which will reduce 
-- and maybe eliminate -- the problem as a matter of practical concern: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- At the first sign of infection in the springtime, remove all infected 
leaves from the garden area. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- When you prune your roses in the wintertime -- anytime from Thanksgiving 
to Valentine's Day -- be sure to remove all leaves from the plants and any leaf 
or stem debris from the garden area. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- If one variety always seems to get the disease first or early in the 
season, dig it out and destroy it. You may replace it with a different variety.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: AIR CLEANERS CAN HELP OUT ALLERGY SUFFERERS

 QUESTION: My allergies are killing me and I need a whole-house air cleaner. 
What is the most effective and easy-to-install air cleaner that will not reduce 
the efficiency of my central air conditioner and furnace? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: There are new designs of whole-house air cleaners (mounted in 
forced-air furnace/air-conditioning blower) that can remove up to 99% of 
pollen, molds, cat dander, smoke, etc. from the air. I have allergies myself 
and I have tested many different air cleaner designs in my own heat pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Several easy-to-install air cleaners slip into the existing one-inch filter 
slot with no modifications. Installing one improves your air conditioner and 
furnace efficiency by keeping the dust off of the heat exchanger coils. 
</P>
<P>
 Residential air cleaner designs include: self-charging electrostatic, pleated 
media, electronic and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air). Self-charging air 
cleaners use a combination of materials. This creates a natural static charge 
to trap allergens and dust. They use no electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 You clean the filter element with a garden hose or in a bathtub. The water 
neutralizes the static charge and the particles easily wash away. With regular 
cleaning, a self-charging air cleaner will last many years. 
</P>
<P>
 One new slip-in self-charging model, System 4, has a small built-in smoke 
detector (9-volt battery). Its smoke alarm alerts you as it automatically shuts 
off the furnace blower. It also alerts you when it's time to clean it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another slip-in design is available in kits so you can custom size it for your 
existing filter opening. These air cleaners have permanent anti-microbial 
treated filter material to control bacteria and fungi growth. Self-charging 
pre-filters are also available for electronic air cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 The most effective (and expensive) air cleaner uses thick HEPA (often used in 
hospitals) and carbon filters. It removes more than 99.97% of particles down to 
0.3 microns, odors, and harmful vapors. The air cleaner has its own blower and 
housing designed to attach to your ducts for simple installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic air cleaners are very effective, particularly for smaller smoke and 
dust particles. They use only as much electricity as a 40-watt light bulb. You 
can easily clean the filter elements in your dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
 Disposable pleated media filters are more effective than simple fiberglass 
filters, but much less than a HEPA unit. Some cost less than $6 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The type of allergies you have determine which type of air cleaner is best for 
you. Molds and pollen are relatively large particles. Cigarette smoke and some 
dusts are a hundred times smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 946 showing a buyer's guide of 15 
whole-house air cleaner manufacturers, filtration methods, filter efficiency 
ratings, prices and a chart showing which ones are most effective for various 
allergies. Please include $2 and a self-addressed envelope.

5 HIDDEN GEMS ON THE ITALIAN RIVIERA; FEW AMERICANS HAVE HEARD OF THESE TINY 
VILLAGES, SET LIKE JEWELS INTO THE LIGURIAN COAST AND KNOWN AS THE CINQUE TERRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Colman Andrews, Andrews, editor of Traveling in Style magazine, is working 
on a book on the cooking of Nice and Liguria. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cinque Terre is one of those places people tend to read about once and 
then dream about forever. 
</P>
<P>
 An isolated part of the northwestern Italian region of Liguria, the Cinque 
Terre is a ruggedly beautiful stretch of coastline inset with five tiny 
villages perched between the Mediterranean and a range of steep coastal hills. 
Articles about the Cinque Terre (pronounced CHEEN-kway TER-ray) invariably 
describe it as a kind of austere, unspoiled paradise. Populated mostly by 
fishermen and farmers and all but inaccessible to cars -- the story goes -- 
both the towns themselves and the surrounding countryside have remained 
unchanged for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The aura of romance about the place is enhanced by the very names of the five 
villages: Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore, from north 
to south. Even the name of the region -- it means "Five Lands" -- makes the 
place sound somehow grand and mysterious. If that isn't the stuff of escapist 
fantasies, what is? 
</P>
<P>
 I first read (and started dreaming) about the Cinque Terre myself a good 25 
years ago, when I ran across a particularly evocative piece about it, 
accompanied by plenty of seductive photographs, in some glossy travel magazine 
of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first visited the Cinque Terre, very briefly, about four years ago, I 
was charmed . . . but a little bit disappointed. Since then, I've been back 
twice, most recently last month. I can't claim to have covered every inch of 
the local landscape, or even to have learned each of its tiny towns by heart, 
but I have spent enough time in the region by now to discover that it is indeed 
beautiful and full of charm but that dreamers should be forewarned: It is no 
longer quite the isolated Eden it must once have been. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Monterosso and Riomaggiore -- the towns on either end -- show 
modest but unmistakable signs of modern development. A bank of ugly green 
apartments is pushed against the hill just outside Monterosso. At the edge of 
Riomaggiore, an incongruously contemporary pastel apartment/office/parking 
complex has recently been constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have a number of small hotels too, which seem to be largely populated by 
tourists from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States (if you don't 
speak Italian, German is the next most useful language to know in these parts). 
Ligurian fishermen and farmers still live and work in the towns, certainly, but 
now so do plenty of well-off Genoese families who have weekend homes here 
(Genoa is only about 50 miles from Monterosso), as well as expatriates from 
Northern Europe looking for a place to paint or write or vegetate. 
</P>
<P>
 The distance between Monterosso and Riomaggiore is only about 11 miles, and 
the towns are linked by frequent train and boat service, as well as a famous 
network of hiking paths, or sentieri . The trip from one end of the region to 
the other by train, including stops at the villages in between, takes about 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're hardy enough, you could walk the entire distance in under six hours. 
Thus, it's easily possible to visit all five of the towns in a day, even if 
you're not staying in any of them. (A popular base of operations for touring 
the area is the delightful town of Levanto, a few miles north of Monterosso, 
which has a number of hotels and is on the Cinque Terre rail line.) 
</P>
<P>
 The question of transportation between the towns brings up the most 
significant difference between legend and reality in the Cinque Terre: Despite 
what most guidebooks and magazine articles will tell you, it is also now 
possible to reach each and every one of the five towns by car. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to Riomaggiore is quite good, in fact. The one to Monterosso is 
slightly less so, but I recommend the drive, as it provides a close-up look at 
the territory -- the steep terraces, the narrow ravines, the little stands of 
olive trees (beneath which orange nets hang to catch the falling fruit), the 
miniature one-seat monorails used in working the vines on these precipitous 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to Corniglia, Vernazza and Manarola by car is, admittedly, a bit more 
difficult: The roads are winding and narrow, sometimes paved only with gravel. 
Anyway, work is now underway to smooth out and widen at least part of the 
route, which will make the towns even easier to get to, and undoubtedly change 
their character even more. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the bad news, at least for dreamers. The good news is that, while there 
isn't much to do in the Cinque Terre, there's plenty to see and much atmosphere 
to soak up. The region might not be truly isolated anymore, but it remains an 
unusual and enchanting corner of the Mediterranean, much further in style and 
spirit than it is in distance from the glossy resorts of the western Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riomaggiore is a curious little town built in a narrow ravine cut by a stream 
rushing down to the sea. The main street, lined with unassuming shops and 
restaurants, descends steeply to a small beach and fishing port; it makes a 
pleasant promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Manarola is a cluster of stone and stucco houses crowded together atop a 
rounded hunk of rock thrust out into the sea. The cove carved out of rock 
beneath it is so small, and the rock so steep and sharp, that the fishermen's 
little boats rest on a cut stone path and two minuscule piazzas about 80 feet 
or so above the water and are winched up and down as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniglia has no boats or fishermen. Believed to have been founded as a 
settlement by the Romans, it is built on a ridge about 300-400 yards above the 
Mediterranean and resembles a backcountry hill town more than a coastal 
village. It is the least colorful and, to me, least interesting of the five 
towns (though some aficionados of the Cinque Terre prefer it for precisely that 
reason). 
</P>
<P>
 Corniglia does boast a significant Gothic-Ligurian-style church, San Pietro. 
This is a compact, clean-lined, gruffly handsome structure built out of white 
(if now time-darkened) Carrara marble (the famous marble quarry town lies about 
20 miles to the south). Its symmetry and quiet visual weight are impressive; it 
seems to anchor the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernazza is the jewel of the Cinque Terre, a picture-book village built around 
the Cinque Terre's only real natural port, small but memorably picturesque. 
Precisely because of this port, Vernazza was colonized by the Genoese in the 
10th Century, and as a result became the most important town on this piece of 
coastline, with the most beautiful houses. These crowd around the port, simple, 
graceful structures glowing warmly in assorted shades of yellow, pink and terra 
cotta. 
</P>
<P>
 A Genoese castle (now containing a restaurant with a great view) rises high 
atop the plump promontory that forms one side of the port. On the other side of 
the port stands another attractive Ligurian church, dedicated to Santa 
Margherita di Antiochia. The square that gives onto the port is full of 
restaurant tables and fishing boats and is always filled with the buzz of 
conversation. One afternoon, I watched as a party broke out of a restaurant 
interior -- Italians in their 50s and 60s, obviously celebrating a wedding 
anniversary -- and literally danced around the square to the music of a 
concertina one of the guests had brought. For a few minutes, anyway, the dream 
revived. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterosso is divided into two parts. The newer part, Monterosso Fegina, is a 
strip of restaurants, bars, small hotels and pensiones along a seafront 
promenade -- agreeable enough but nothing special. It is here, though, that 
non-residents must park, and here that the train stops.  
</P>
<P>
 Just to the south, on the other side of a rounded clump of rock (a tunnel cuts 
through it and a footpath curves around it), is the town's old quarter, called 
Monterosso al Mare. This is an absolute delight of pretty little streets and 
squares. Modest shops, bars, trattorias and enotecas (wine stores) practically 
line the streets, and there are several outlets for such Ligurian gastronomic 
specialties as olives, olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes and ready-made pesto. The 
town is less assertively picturesque than Vernazza, but it has an unassuming 
beauty that I find very pleasant indeed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite the efficient train and boat connections between the towns, and the 
possibility of driving between them, dreamers will want to negotiate at least a 
portion of the area's oldest transportation system -- the sentieri , or 
footpaths, that run along the cliffs from one village to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cinque Terre, in fact, is a walker's paradise. These are basically hill 
towns, and even if you arrive here by train, you'll have to do some walking to 
get anywhere (except in Vernazza, where the station is just a few blocks up a 
mild slope from the port). 
</P>
<P>
 The paths that link the towns have been used for many centuries, though 
they've obviously been worked on and adapted for heavier foot traffic in modern 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortest and easiest leg of the sentieri is the so-called Via 
dell'Amore(Road of Love, presumably because of its romantic setting), which 
runs between Riomaggiore and Manarola, hugging the coastline.On my recent 
visit, I had planned to negotiate this portion of the path, but unfortunately, 
it's closed for structural repairs until at least mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I couldn't walk the easiest sentiero , I decided to walk the longest and 
most difficult one, between Monterosso and Vernazza. The more serious walker 
might not find this footpath particularly challenging, but I found it tough 
going at times. Suffice to say that it is not a stroll along a beachfront 
promenade.  
</P>
<P>
 It is tortuous, rocky, slippery (at least after a rain, when I walked it), 
vertiginous. There are hundreds of steep steps, both irregular poured concrete 
and fragmented rock. There are scrambles both up and down hills and sections of 
path no more than two feet wide, with no guardrails or even low rock barriers, 
running alongside long drops into thorny bushes, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That said, I must also report that it didn't take me much longer than the 
advertised two hours to get from one town to the next, and that the experience 
was truly memorable.  
</P>
<P>
 On both the Monterosso and Vernazza ends of the path, I felt as if I had 
discovered a secret rural civilization of tiny rough gardens, olive trees, 
vineyards planted with patches of stubby vines, all packed onto narrow terraces 
and into clefts in the rock. (Some of the terraces were so poor in soil, it is 
said, that sacks of dirt had to be lugged up here from boats on the coast just 
to give the vines a purchase.)  
</P>
<P>
 Here and there was a farmer's shack, sometimes with a few chickens pecking the 
hard ground outside. In places, the path was lined with old stone walls into 
which are set old wooden doors that look as if they haven't been opened in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In between the towns, the landscape grows wilder. Dense scrub in a hundred 
shades of green covers the rocks, accented liberally with the yellows, whites, 
reds and pinks of wildflowers. Scotch broom, arbutus, valerian, wild thyme and 
juniper, spurge, sea fennel, myrtle trees, Aleppo pines -- the variety of flora 
is immense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the views are remarkable: All around are dramatic upthrust rocks that seem 
to be still moving, rising out of dense gray-green hillsides. The sea is 
beautiful, as green and clear as glass immediately below, becoming increasingly 
darker blue until it suddenly fades into mist on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterosso, which I glimpsed a dozen times or more from different heights and 
angles as I stopped to look around, grew ever prettier with distance -- and 
when I first spotted Vernazza, my goal, glistening through the trees, it looked 
as alluring as a fairy-tale castle -- a place to dream about. GUIDEBOOK: The 
Lay of the Lands 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The nearest major airports to the Cinque Terre are Genoa, about 
55 miles from Monterosso, and Milan, about 140 miles. Alitalia has daily 
nonstop service from Los Angeles to Milan, with connections to Genoa. There are 
also nonstop flights to Genoa from London. The region is also driving distance 
from Nice, Turin and Florence. From Genoa, there are trains to the Cinque Terre 
(see below); by car, take the A-12 highway to Carrodano, then follow signs to 
Monterosso or the other villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around: Trains pass through the Cinque Terre every hour-and-a-half or 
so throughout the day, less frequently at night. A one-way ticket costs about 
$1, whether for a short run between any two of the towns or the full distance 
from Riomaggiore to Monterosso (about a 20-minute trip). There is also an 
all-day ticket, good for unlimited travel in both directions, for about $2.65. 
There is also boat service five times a day between Monterosso, Vernazza, 
Manarola and Riomaggiore (no stop at Corniglia) for about $4.65 one way.  
</P>
<P>
 Walking the sentieri: The paths, both the main ones between the five towns and 
various offshoots (including continuations to the north and south of the Cinque 
Terre) are well marked. Wear hiking or sturdy walking shoes, and bring at least 
a small bottle of water. Morning and late afternoon are best for walking the 
sentieri in summertime; at midday, the heat can be intense. Do not under any 
circumstances get caught in the middle of a path at nightfall, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The closest thing to a luxury hotel in the area is Porto Roca 
(Via Corone 1, Monterosso al Mare, 19016 La Spezia, Italy; telephone 
011-39-187-817-502; fax 011-39-187-817-692). Amenities include a friendly 
staff, decent restaurant, comfortable (if not opulent) rooms and a spectacular 
view of the coastline. Doubles $120-$165 per night; the hotel will send its 
minibus if you call from the train station. Hotel Jolie (Via Gioberti 1, 
Monterosso, 19016 La Spezia; tel. 011-39-187-817-539, fax 011-39-187-817-273) 
is a modest, warm-feeling place with a small orange-tree-filled garden and a 
quiet location a few blocks from the beach. Rates: $60-$76 per person, double, 
including breakfast and dinner. Marina Piccola (Via Antonio Discovolo, 
Manarola, 10910 La Spezia; tel. 011-39-187-920-103; fax 011-39-187-920-966), 
has basic accommodations in the middle of town, overlooking the sea, with one 
of the region's better restaurants attached; $46-$60 per double.  
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Belvedere (Piazza Garibaldi 38, Monterosso; local tel. 817-033) 
is an unassuming trattoria serving good minestrone, pastas and seafood dishes 
(about $55 for two). Ristorante Ciak (La Lampara) (Piazza Don Minzoni 6, 
Monterosso; tel. 817-014) is a bustling restaurant specializing in pasta and 
fresh local fish and shellfish; about $65 for two. Al Castello (Via Guidoni 56, 
Vernazza; tel. 812-296) is situated high above the town with a spectacular 
terrace and a standard local menu of mostly seafood and pasta; about $55 for 
two. Gambero Rosso (Piazza Marconi, Vernazza; tel. 812-265) is widely 
considered the best in the village, with a seaside terrace and a few surprises 
on the menu (rice with baby shrimp and lemon, a warm salad of fresh anchovies, 
tomatoes and potatoes); about $80 for two. Gianni Franzi (Piazza Marconi, 
Vernazza; tel. 812-228) is on the piazza in front of the port, with tables 
under an arcade; stuffed mussels and various fish dishes are best; about $60 
for two. The best "serious" restaurant in the region is a few miles northwest 
of Monterosso in Levanto: L'Araldo (Via Jacopo 24, Levanto, tel. 807-253) is 
small and beautifully decorated, with amiable service, an excellent wine list 
and superb Ligurian-style cooking with contemporary touches; the pennette pasta 
with red mullet and asparagus is not to be missed.

TRAVEL INSIDER: THE MASSES WAIT FOR FLIGHTS; YOU DROP INTO YOUR CLUB; AIRPORTS: 
AIRLINE MEMBERSHIP LOUNGES OFFER COMFORTABLE SEATS AND FREE COFFEE. OTHERWISE, 
THEY VARY IN PRICE AND PERKS AND COMPARING THEM CAN BE TRICKY.

 When it comes to choosing an airline membership lounge, Randy Petersen knows 
what he likes -- or does he? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like United's Red Carpet Clubs because they want to charge me for a 
Coke, and I like Delta, Continental and USAir because they don't charge me for 
one," says Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer newsletter and an incessant 
flyer. But then again, Petersen adds, several Red Carpet Clubs have started 
installing ATM machines, "and I think that's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluating airline clubs is tricky, and seldom attempted. Many travelers 
decline to spend the extra money a membership costs (usually about $150 a 
year), and many of those who do pay have simply enrolled with the carrier where 
their frequent-flyer miles are, and never get a sense of how one club compares 
with another. 
</P>
<P>
 The club lounge concept dates back to 1939, when American airlines opened one 
at LaGuardia Airport in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Most clubs offer discounts for spouses and multiple-year memberships. Though 
hours vary, facilities are fairly constant: comfortable seats, faxes, 
photocopiers, televisions, a bar, sometimes personal computers. Coffee and tea 
are always free -- and at Delta and Northwest clubs, so are alcoholic 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are supposed to use clubs only on days they're flying with the 
sponsoring airline, although tickets are seldom checked. Members are generally 
able to bring in guests, and are urged to dress for business, but standards 
have relaxed over the last decade. A tieless traveler in jeans scarcely gets a 
second look in most clubs these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Several airlines say they sold many long-term memberships in the weeks before 
club affiliations lost their federal tax-deductible status in January. But on 
the whole, attendants say, the fact that clubs are no longer legitimate 
business deductions hasn't substantially affected membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the seven busiest U.S.-based airlines, listed below, maintains a club 
at LAX. (So do 16 other U.S. and international carriers. John Wayne Airport in 
Orange County houses clubs for American and United airlines, but the Burbank, 
Long Beach, Ontario and San Diego airports are loungeless.)  
</P>
<P>
 Delta. Crown Room. Some 39 clubs in the U.S. and Canada. Individual fees: $150 
per year, no initiation. (Frequent flyers can also exchange 30,000 miles for 
membership.) Alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, orange juice free. (404) 
715-6615. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines. Admirals Club. Individual fees: $100 initiation, plus $150 
annually, rising to $175 on Friday. Some 29 clubs in the U.S. and 13 around the 
world. New clubs opening this September in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, and a new 
emphasis on South America, because of increasing traffic there. In the U.S., 
many clubs added ATM machines this year. American Airlines officials described 
their club membership figures as "privileged information." Free morning 
pastries at some sites; prices for soft drinks and orange juice vary. (800) 
237-7971. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines. Red Carpet Club. Individual fees: $100 initiation. Annual 
fee: $175. Some 23 clubs in the U.S. and 15 around the world, most in Asia and 
the South Pacific, with three in Latin America and just one in Europe (London). 
More than 200,000 members. ATM machines added this year at five domestic sites. 
United will open its third club in Chicago later this year; others are in the 
works in Frankfurt, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Free cappuccino and espresso 
added at most U.S. clubs in the last year. Morning pastries and orange juice 
available at some sites; soft drink prices vary. (602) 881-0500. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir. USAir Club. Some 26 clubs in 20 U.S. cities, all of them east of the 
Mississippi except the club at LAX. Individual fees: $200 for first year, $150 
for each succeeding year. Soft drinks, orange juice and morning pastries free. 
(800) 828-8522. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest Airlines. World Club. Some 16 locations in the U.S. and nine 
overseas: Bangkok, Hong Kong, London, Amsterdam, Manila, Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul 
and Taipei. Individual fees: $175 yearly, plus $50 initiation. (Initiation fee 
waived if travelers have paid for and flown 25,000 Northwest miles in the last 
year; seniors memberships available for $115 annually, with no initiation 
charge.) Detroit and Minneapolis clubs are being enlarged this summer. 
Alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, orange juice free. (800) 692-3788. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental. Presidents Club. Individual fees: $200 for first year, $150 for 
each following year. Some 15 clubs in the U.S., plus one in London and one in 
Paris. About 50,000-60,000 members, by a spokeswoman's estimate. Under a 
program begun last year, 30-day trial memberships can be had for $30. Soft 
drinks, peanuts, morning juice and pastries free. (800) 322-2640. 
</P>
<P>
 Trans World Airlines (TWA). Ambassadors Club. Some 14 locations in the U.S. 
and foreign clubs in Frankfurt, London (shared with other carriers), Milan, 
Paris and Rome. Individual fees: $150 for first year (with a bonus credit of 
5,000 miles to the bearer's TWA Frequent Flight program) and $125 for each 
succeeding year. On July 1, spousal membership fees rise from $25 to $75 
yearly. The carrier has tentative plans to refurbish its clubs in St. Louis and 
Kennedy airport in New York this fall. Coffee, orange juice and rolls are free, 
but soft drinks carry a price, which varies from club to club. (800) 527-1468.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; YOU WILL BE NICER, FRENCH ARE TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMES OF LONDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only days after the French parliament passed a law proclaiming war on English 
(making it a punishable offense to use foreign words in advertising, on 
television or in any official capacity if a French equivalent exists), the 
French Tourism Ministry launched a campaign to persuade citizens to be nicer to 
foreigners and address them in their own language with such expressions as 
"sank you veri meutch." 
</P>
<P>
 "Operation Bonjour" is the latest in a series of official attempts over the 
past two decades to tackle that sour streak in the fun-loving Gallic character 
that fuels the foreigners' cliche: "Great country; too bad about the French." 
</P>
<P>
 The Transport and Tourism Ministry said the dissatisfaction and disappointment 
of foreigners "have only one source, and it is nothing to do with the 
countryside and monuments, but with the people. Despite efforts over several 
years to correct it, this image of a country that does not make a big priority 
of welcoming people is still spreading abroad." Too often, foreigners are 
greeted with "sloppiness, a closed-mindedness and difficulty adapting to new 
expectations and ignorance of foreign languages and habits," it said. These 
charges concerned "the whole population." 
</P>
<P>
 If the campaign works, visitors this summer will find airports, stations, 
roads, shops and hotels crowded with friendly greeters and decked with logos 
bidding them "bienvenu."

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; HAWAII READIES FOR 'CUISINES OF THE SUN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a chili in the air on the Big Island of Hawaii where organizers are 
getting ready for the fifth annual "Cuisines of the Sun" festival, featuring 
the food of "Chili Climates." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day festival opens July 23 at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and 
Bungalows.Guest chefs will include Rick Bayless, author of the book "Authentic 
Mexico"; Julie Sahni, author of "Classic Indian Cooking" and Emeril Lagasse, 
chef of Emeril's and NOLA in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Cuisines of the Sun" package, including four nights in an ocean-view 
accommodation and attendance at all 10 Cuisines events, is available for $1,480 
single occupancy, $2,180 double. The cuisine program is offered independently 
at $700 and nightly room rates are $225. For reservations, call (800) 367-2323. 
Getting to the Hong Kong Airport 
</P>
<P>
 New, slightly higher fares have been announced for Hong Kong's airport bus 
services. A ticket to the Tsimshatsui tourist district in Kowloon is now about 
$1.40. Service between the airport and the Macao Ferry Terminal, Causeway Bay 
and the Tai Koo Shing are all $2.05. The buses, which use circular routes and 
stop near many of the city's major hotels, are a bargain: A taxi into Hong Kong 
will set you back $9.

 THE CLEANEST AND DIRTIEST CITIES IN EUROPE 
</P>
<P>
 London is Europe's cleanest city and Athens the dirtiest, according Tidy 
Britain Group, an anti-litter organization.The biannual study surveyed areas in 
nine European capitals for litter, graffiti and other unsightliness. Tidy 
Britain's rankings and comments: 
</P>
<P>
 London -- The highest number of Grade A sites -- no litter. Berne -- Generally 
very clean. Paris -- The dirtiest shopping street. Berlin -- Enormous 
infrastructure and development pressure. Many survey streets were inaccessible. 
Amsterdam -- The graffiti capital Brussels -- Slipped from fourth place since 
1991. Rome -- The Romans have not yet learned to poop-scoop. Madrid -- The 
dog-fouling capital of Europe Athens -- A virtual plague of cigarette ends.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: DANA POINT; SWEET SUNDAY; SAVORING A FULL TWO DAYS OF REPOSE BY 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DANA POINT RESORT'S LATE SUNDAY CHECKOUT PERK

<P>
 Pardon me, but who thought up this system? You check into a romantic resort 
Friday night; you're in heaven all day Saturday . . . and come high noon Sunday 
you're booted out of your room to make way for the incoming convention crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't a weekend away mean two full days? 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dana Point Resort in South Orange County, it usually does. Here we are 
now, still in our room Sunday and watching the reflection of the setting sun in 
the Pacific. Did we have to act like a screeching Leona Helmsley to get this? 
No. Did we have to pay extra for extending our noon checkout time to 6 p.m.? 
No. Do we -- a couple now as relaxed as creme brulee -- feel as if we've 
squeezed every leisure-time second out of our sweet getaway? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how we did it, guilt-free. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked into a place that is so pleasant it's painful to leave. Then we 
called the front desk and asked for a late checkout -- a really late one. 
Instead of being treated like poor relations asking for seconds, the woman at 
the front desk said, "No problem." After five visits here, we've come to expect 
this bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a loosely kept secret that the resort upgrades "regular room" people 
to the concierge level as often as it can (on low-occupancy days, etc.). At 
that level the perks include third-floor ocean views, butler service, 
complimentary breakfast buffet and unlimited hors d'oeuvres and cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
 For this weekend in late March, we had reserved a regular room for $129 a 
night hoping to be upgraded to concierge, where rooms start at $200. In 
previous visits we'd been lucky several times to receive deluxe treatment for 
the price of a regular room. This time we didn't make it to the top, but we 
didn't complain about the quality of the room we legitimately paid for. Our 
second-floor room was the same size as the ones on the concierge floor, with a 
balcony view of the garden and the ocean. (Unless you want to mingle with 
children, avoid the first floor rooms, especially the ones near the two pools 
during the summertime.) 
</P>
<P>
 The journey to the resort can get you in the mood for a relaxing, loving 
weekend. Dana Point is an easy escape from the smog and log-jam of Southern 
California. You can take the direct route by way of Interstate 5 to Dana Point 
or the more scenic route on Pacific Coast Highway (parking is free at the 
resort). Or you can avoid driving altogether by riding Amtrak or Metrolink to 
the San Juan Capistrano depot. The resort offers a free shuttle from the 
historic train station. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you're at the resort, you'll discover that you don't need a car. Sights, 
shops and restaurants are within walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday evening from our balcony, we watched the water change colors in the 
setting sun, then left the Cape Cod-style resort on the bluff to walk through 
Lantern Bay Park and down a staircase to Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Harbor Grill, a high-energy restaurant with a piano player who pounds 
out jaunty tunes (we entered to the "Charlie Brown" theme song), we enjoyed a 
zippy fresh Pacific swordfish ($17.95) but didn't think much of the undercooked 
halibut with canton sauce ($14.95). To avoid a 45-minute wait for an indoor 
table, we sat outside near the heaters, protected from the salty breeze by a 
see-through covering. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, we danced at Mugs Away Saloon, a wanna-be dive that's famous for 
its annual "Moon the Amtrak" event (July 9 this year). Underneath blown-up 
photos of men and women exposing their assets, we danced to surf-rock, blues 
and Tex-Mex played by the Rounders, a band our friend Randy sings in. He also 
plays tenor sax, accordion, harmonica and, more important, tambourine and 
cowbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning we returned to the harbor, a 10-minute walk from our room. 
Although weather forecasters had predicted rain for the weekend, we wore shorts 
and sunglasses, basking under the pillowy clouds. The bicyclists, picnickers 
and sleepy people fishing off one of the jetties we passed along the harbor 
walk looked like characters from a Seurat painting. 
</P>
<P>
 We had coffee and pastry at the Scoop Deck, a locals' hangout, then walked 
around the marina with its bounty of shops. Under the trellised walkway, we 
passed the yachts tucked into private slips and a tiny still-water beach where 
beginning windsurfers struggled to stay upright. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Near the dead-end of Dana Point Harbor Drive is the Orange County Marine 
Institute, a nondescript building that houses the skeleton of a gray whale and 
some live squirmy stuff too. We placed our hands inside a touch tank and felt 
the squishy sea cucumbers, anemones and keyhole limpets. There is no admission 
charge, but visitors usually drop a few coins into a glass box near the octopus 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Docked outside the institute is the Pilgrim II, a full-size replica of the 
trading ship that sailed into this natural cove in 1835 with Richard Henry Dana 
aboard. In his book, "Two Years Before the Mast," Dana called it "the most 
romantic spot in California." 
</P>
<P>
 We walked across Dana Point Harbor Drive to the Heritage Brewing Co., a 
restaurant and micro-brewery in the bright yellow Pavilion center. We sat in 
the sun, ordered blond ales ($2.75 a pint) and grilled mahi-mahi sandwiches 
($6.25). As we listened to the live blues, I realized that beer had become only 
a faint memory for me, much like Donny and Marie's variety show on ABC in the 
late '70s. Where had Donny and Marie gone? I remembered that beer sets me to 
musing. 
</P>
<P>
 We saw another rose-tinged nightfall from our room with the view, then 
returned to the Pavilion for dinner at Ferrantelli's, a restaurant with a rich 
ambience created by dimmed lighting and cherry wood paneling. We ate 
tantalizing charbroiled veal chops with white wine sauce, shiitake mushrooms 
and fresh garlic ($22.95) and boneless chicken breast with sherry wine sauce 
and green peppers ($14.95). 
</P>
<P>
 At Ferrantelli's, you can ask for a decaffeinated cappuccino after dinner but 
you won't get it. As our waiter said, "We don't do decaf. But our cappuccinos 
are worth staying up for." 
</P>
<P>
 We walked back to our room under a full moon. 
</P>
<P>
 A word about "California casual" attire: It is strictly enforced in Dana 
Point. Unless you're at the Dining Room in the Ritz-Carlton, no one expects you 
to wear a jacket and tie even at the elegant Ferrantelli's or the Dana Point 
Resort's tony Watercolors restaurant. For your weekend, pack for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, here comes the big payoff: Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a normal situation, we would have had breakfast, paid our bill, gone home 
and spent a beautiful afternoon doing laundry. Or, we could have become hotel 
nomads: vacating our room early to comply with strict checkout times, storing 
luggage with the bell captain and loitering around the lobby and gardens until 
we felt the welcome mat had been yanked away. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but no dice for us (you know, you're right. We are demanding). 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was our day to rest around the resort. We could have gorged on the huge 
Sunday brunch at Watercolors, then groaned away the day at the pool, but 
instead, we ordered breakfast in our room (service was fast and accommodating 
to our special requests) and lazed around most of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early afternoon, we played croquet in the grass near one of the pools 
and Ping-Pong near the three lighted tennis courts. (When was the last time we 
did that? Pre-disco, I believe.). 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, we went to the Lantern Bay Lounge in the resort for a tea repast 
that was a refined taste of E.M. Forster ($11.25 a person). With our pot of 
special brew, we ate proper portions of finger sandwiches, scones, Devonshire 
cream, jams, berries, carrot cake and strawberry tarts. 
</P>
<P>
 We whiled away the rest of the day and captured a perfect Sunday sunset -- our 
third -- before checking out at 6:30 p.m. to the voice of a front desk person 
asking, "Did you have fun?" Budget for Two

BOOKS TO GO: VOLUME IN SERIES IS OFF THE TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: ITALY, revised edition, by Richard Sale, Phil Whitney 
and Nancy Woodyatt (Moorland Publishing/Globe Pequot Press, $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Is it fair to judge a whole series of guidebooks by one volume out of nine? 
For that matter, is it fair to judge one volume by its treatment of one area? 
</P>
<P>
 First published between 1989 and 1992, the intriguing "Off the Beaten Track" 
books have just been reissued in revised editions. Besides Italy, they cover 
Austria, Britain, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Scandinavia, Spain and 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to offer casually sketched itineraries through lesser-known, 
mostly rural portions of countries that are otherwise very well traveled -- off 
the highways and onto the byways, as it were. It's an excellent notion for a 
guidebook series, and the tone in which the books are written (by a variety of 
authors) is attractive. There are no mile-by-mile (or rather 
kilometer-by-kilometer) guided tours here, just advice on where to drive or 
hike and what to watch for as you do. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately . . . . to spot-check the guides, I picked up the Italian volume 
and turned to the chapter on a region where I have lately been spending quite a 
bit of time myself -- Liguria, the "Italian Riviera," which curves along the 
coast between the French border and Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, I was surprised by several things: that the famous English-founded Villa 
Hanbury botanical gardens near Ventimiglia was described as the German-sounding 
Villa Hamburg; that the Museo Bicknell in Bordighera was listed (with incorrect 
opening days) as a place to visit (its name notwithstanding, it is a library 
open to scholars by appointment and not a museum, as anyone who had been there 
would know); that, in writing about the mountain village of Triora, the authors 
make no mention of its ethnographic museum, with its displays devoted to the 
(literal) medieval witch hunts for which the place is famous; and that Taggia, 
which has no hotels this reviewer would want to stay in, is recommended as a 
base of operations for one itinerary -- when Arma di Taggia, which has several 
nice hotels, is only two miles away and would make a much better base. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, though, I was surprised to find the Tuscan city of Carrara 
relocated 50 miles or so to the northwest on the coast near Genoa. (Talk about 
continental drift.) In other words, as appealing as these guides are, I'd use 
them -- and especially the Italian volume -- with care. Otherwise, you might 
end up more off the beaten track than you'd planned. 
</P>

 THAILAND, collected and edited by James O'Reilly and Larry Habegger 
(Travelers' Tales, $15.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the two hottest genres in travel-book publishing today seem to be 
MTV/USA Today/short-attention-span little guides with lots of charts and 
pictures and not very many boring old words, and volumes like this one -- books 
meant for reading rather than for sightseeing, offering literary or at least 
deftly journalistic sketches of a place. With "Thailand," in fact, a whole new 
(if admittedly small) San Francisco-based publishing company, dedicated to 
precisely the latter kind of work, makes its debut. (Tales of Mexico, France, 
India and Hong Kong are next.) 
</P>
<P>
 This anthology includes pieces by such noted travel writers and journalists as 
Pico Iyer, Norman Lewis, Robert Sam Anson, Thurston Clarke, Simon Winchester 
and more, and the breadth and color of the collective portrait they provide of 
Thailand is remarkable. The little proverbs and asides peppered through the 
pages add still more flavor.

 PRAGUEWALKS by Ivana Edwards and ROMEWALKS, revised edition, by Anya Shetterly 
(Owl Books/Henry Holt & Co., each $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 This widely imitated series keeps producing some of the best introductory 
guides to the world's great cities. They are specialized guides in a sense. But 
they have general utility, explaining and describing each destination's 
history, character and look from -- as it were -- the inside out. Ivana Edwards 
shows us her Prague (she was born in the city) with a friendly insider's tone, 
though some segments seem needlessly dense with elucidated names and dates. 
</P>
<P>
 In her updated look at Rome (the first "Romewalks" was published 10 years 
ago), Anya Shetterly weaves at least three grand epochs of history, art and 
architecture together skillfully, leavening it with plenty of anecdotes and 
legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Both volumes are valuable, vastly informative guidebooks, even for the reader 
who will probably never actually tread the streets of these cities with them in 
hand. 
</P>

 CAMP THE U.S. FOR $5 OR LESS: Eastern and Midwestern States by Mary Helen and 
Shuform Smith (Globe Pequot, $13.95 paper). A sort of Guide Michelin for 
campers in 37 states east of the Continental Divide -- abbreviated but covering 
the essentials.

DESTINATION: HAWAII; ROMANCING THE VOLCANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Palm trees, balmy surf, the two of us strolling hand-in-hand, a kiss under a 
half moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality check! 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Presley?" "Henri, stop it!" "Matty, share with your sister!" 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a Hawaiian honeymoon with three kids . . . . What were we thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 We get to hold hands under palm trees, we even kiss on balmy beaches. But one 
eye is always on keiki (child) patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, on the flight to the Big Island, we are playing "Pass the Baby" to 
try to combat 1-year-old Presley's wiggling, which is in serious danger of 
knocking over the other kids' guava juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the portholes of our plane, an alien terrain rises from the Pacific 
Ocean. A black tongue of hardened lava rock sticks out in front of us like a 
lunar welcome mat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii, the "Volcano Island," is the second stop on our epic summer family 
adventure. We touch down on the west coast on Keahole Airport's hot Tarmac, 
jump in our "Hi, I'm a tourist" blue rental sedan and set the air-conditioning 
on max. 
</P>
<P>
 We hang a right and head south for the Manago Hotel on Hawaii 11. It's a road 
with character. Lined in lava, people use the sides of the highway as a message 
board, arranging greetings in white coral. "Aloha Waterworld," reads one, 
referring to the movie Kevin Costner will begin filming nearby this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The highway scenery changes to a winding smorgasbord of mango trees, avocados, 
macadamia nuts and the region's famous coffee plantations. 
</P>
<P>
 A light rain sprinkles us as we pull into the Manago Hotel -- a mom-and-pop 
operation that has been in the family since the 1920s. For $45 a night we move 
into a small room with a double bed, two twins and a vintage radio. It's basic, 
but really clean. No phones, no TV, no frills, but there's an awesome view of 
the Kona coastline from the lanai. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee farms, some of them small family operations, are scattered across the 
slopes above Kealakekua Bay. It's all music to our java-addicted souls. 
</P>
<P>
 Our 7-year-old son, Henri, has been jittery for weeks about another Big Island 
attraction we're heading out to in the next few days: visiting and camping on 
the world's most active crater, Kilauea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could the whole island erupt?" he asked earnestly, trying not to act too 
worried. "How would they warn us?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the windy edge of the Kilauea Caldera, at the peak of the volcano, Henri's 
fears aren't exactly laid to rest by National Park volunteer ranger, Dwight 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing at Halemaumau crater, the most likely spot for the next eruption, 
ranger Hamilton tells our son, "We are about due for another big one." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ranger and just about every other islander we meet is looking forward 
to Kilauea or nearby Mauna Loa blowing their stacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in L.A. are a lot more worried about an earthquake than we are about 
an eruption," he says. "They generally don't hurt anyone, they are people 
friendly, drive-up eruptions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Namakani Paio campground is a half-mile walk from the caldera. In blustery 
winds we set up our tents and then head off to the coast to find Kilauea's sea 
of red hot lava. 
</P>
<P>
 A switchback road drops us 4,000 feet down the side of the volcano. In the 
distance, smoke billows from a rocky peninsula. An eruption that has lasted 12 
years continues in a furious meeting of earth, wind and fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look. It's making clouds," Matilda, 5, says, pointing at the steam rising 
from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike ahead is across a mile of lava rock, shaped in incredible patterns 
that look like drips of black pudding and twiney rope. The ground glistens with 
jeweled hues of gold, green and blue. "It's beautiful and sparkly," Matilda 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature rises and the wind whips into a frenzy as the trail, made of 
traffic cones, ends. We almost stumble onto a ridge of hot pahoehoe lava that 
is dark gray with small chambers of red liquid rock that ooze toward us. 
</P>
<P>
 The lava inches very slowly to the sea in an astonishing display of nature. A 
shower of rain bursts above us as we watch the creation of the newest land on 
earth. "This is so cool," Henri says, getting as close as the heat will allow. 
</P>
<P>
 The air temperature has risen to 140 degrees. "I'm too hot. I wanna go home," 
Matilda wails. 
</P>
<P>
 We head north from the volcano along the windward and wet coast of Hawaii. In 
the rain forest city of Hilo, where hibiscus and orchids bloom like weeds, our 
campground is flooded by a powerful morning storm. At the height of the 
downpour, Henri and Matilda's tent billows in the wind like a fun house. To our 
amazement the kids stay fast asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 We are chased by the heavy rain back to the dry Kona coast and a beachside 
campground at Spencer Beach Park, 30 miles north of Kailua-Kona. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children are immediately drawn to the kind blue eyes of Vince Portell, a 
pipe-smoking former merchant seaman we met at our campground, who says he's "as 
old as the hills" and lives on the beaches of Hawaii. He wears a big straw hat 
over a leathery tanned face and unkempt wiry beard. "I like the freedom," 
Portell says with a soft chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley reaches over to him with both hands. The old man looks surprised but 
takes her in his stringy arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how long it's been since I held a baby? I can't remember," he says, 
his voice breaking a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw my girl as a baby 'cause I was always at sea. She was my pride 
and joy." Portell wipes his eyes and hands Presley back. 
</P>
<P>
 The old man reminds us that even during the most exasperating moments, this 
adventure with our children truly is a honeymoon in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality check.

SHOPPING: TANZANIA AND KENYA; ARTISTRY IN EBONY; CARVINGS TELL LYRICAL TALES OF 
AFRICAN ODYSSEYS AND ATTITUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE BROWN, Brown is a professor at San Diego State and an amateur art 
collector. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our travel agent protested when my wife and I insisted on spending time in Dar 
es Salaam last summer, since the main thrust of our Tanzanian trip was the game 
parks hundreds of miles inland. "What is in Dar?" he asked, with undisguised 
incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, part of the answer was a return to the city where I had conducted a 
three-week journalism workshop in 1979 under the auspices of the U.S. State 
Department. It was a chance to explore and to renew some acquaintances. For 
both my wife and me, it was part of the vacation of a lifetime, an African 
odyssey that also would take us to Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also an opportunity to shop for folk art near its source, something we 
do with zest when we travel, and we wanted to enlarge our collection of Makonde 
wood carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 The carvings are aptly described in the 1994 Lonely Planet travel guide to 
East Africa, which says: "Done with inspiration, attention to detail, and an 
appreciation of the life force which motivates its imagery, it's a superbly 
unique art form matched nowhere else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Makonde people came north to the Dar es Salaam area from Mozambique, 
before the turn of this century, moving north across the Ruvuma River into what 
then was Tanganyika. The neighboring tribes had called them "Mahwia," the angry 
ones, perhaps because they had a reputation as fierce warriors against the 
Mozambique colonial forces. The carvers in each Makonde village -- those who 
fashioned the ebony sculptures used in adulthood initiations and other 
ceremonies -- naturally moved north with their fellow villagers and began a 
remarkable artistic tradition that came to have many copiers, a few credible, 
many not. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly a century later, the majority of Makonde-style art is not produced 
by Makonde carvers, the wood used is rarely ebony, Tanganyika now is Tanzania 
and the Mahwia anger seems lost, even to the contemporary Makonde, in the harsh 
mists of the Ruvuma River and the oral fragments of unwritten history. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers will encounter so-called "Makonde carvings" in curio shops, at 
roadside stands, dusty village markets, airports, art galleries, street 
corners, hotel gift shops and museums throughout East Africa. But "Makonde 
carvings" is a term that might better be expressed as Makonde- style carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 Makonde-style carvings are contemporary, abstract and finely crafted, setting 
them apart from most other African art. 
</P>
<P>
 The Makonde people tend to be associated with the tropical coastal strip and 
adjoining savannah that runs from northern Kenya south through Tanzania and 
Mozambique. The artistic center seems to be around Dar es Salaam, but workshops 
exist throughout the area. Makonde-style carvings now may be found everywhere 
in East Africa, and in particular abundance in commercial and tourist centers 
such as Nairobi, Malindi and Mombasa in Kenya, and in Dar and Arusha in 
Tanzania. We also shopped in Nairobi and found some fine carvings there. 
</P>
<P>
 Makonde carving has come to be appreciated by Europeans, as well as Americans, 
although it is not well represented in museums outside Germany. It is said to 
be particularly appreciated in Asia, and a special society was formed in Japan 
for lovers of the art after Expo '70, when the Tanzanian government sent 
Makonde artists and artifacts to Osaka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tanzanian government established the National Cottage Industries Corp. in 
1965 to help train, support and encourage artistic and related production at 
the village and cottage levels. It established connections with Moscow and 
former East Germany in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest Makonde carvings were female figures -- the Makonde are 
matrilineal (of female lineage) -- and mpiko (helmet masks). Only later did the 
sculptures represent men and women in daily activities: a drummer, perhaps, or 
a smoker, or a woman with a child or a pot. Some mpiko are available in antique 
shops and since they are antiques, and possibly rare, are generally quite 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 With the influx of tourism to Tanzania in the 1950s and 1960s, new styles and 
forms merged with the old to meet a rapidly expanding, relatively affluent 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these is the stylized depiction of shetani (spirits or devils), a 
particular combination of the graceful and the grotesque. In Makonde legend, 
shetani are forest or bush spirits, occasionally dangerous to man, varying from 
the size of a finger to larger than a man. Depending on who one asks, there are 
scores or even hundreds of different kinds of shetani.  
</P>
<P>
 Shetani, travelers are told, never eat prepared food (preferring raw food, 
including raw meat) frequently drink blood, engage in athletic mating and have 
their own societies. The shetani sculptures are characterized by spindly limbs 
and, usually, at least one exaggerated body part, usually a head, sometimes a 
reproductive organ. Often they are carved carrying weapons, such as a spear or 
knife. Most appear fearsome as well as fanciful, sometimes with heads 
resembling pterodactyls with lip plugs. Some carvers claim to have an older 
relative or associate who actually has seen a shetani.  
</P>
<P>
 A more recent carving development is a style referred to as ujamaa . Ujamaa 
frequently is a fairly representational depiction of a strong father or mother 
figure draped from shoulder to ankle with intertwined, clinging children. 
Ujamaa (which is visually represented by the tree or family of life) was part 
of the national philosophy propounded by Tanzania's first president, Julius 
Nyerere, and is not unlike the family values theme that characterized George 
Bush's 1992 presidential campaign. Ujamaa carvings are by no means limited to 
Makonde, although that is a principal association. Many shoppers will find the 
stalwart ujamaa more pleasant -- if less dramatic and iconoclastic -- than 
shetani.  
</P>
<P>
 A third form associated with the Makonde carvers is sometimes referred to as 
"clouds" or "sky" or mawingu. The style is characterized by a cylindrical 
latticework of intertwined, abstract, human figures, both male and female, 
evoking a feeling of elation. The cylinder is usually hollow or, when it isn't, 
the graceful figures are separated from the solid core of wood that forms the 
cylinder center, almost as if they were dancing around it. These carvings, like 
some ujamaa, sometimes are more than four feet high and command prices 
approaching $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Size is only one of the factors that drive Makonde carving prices. Another is 
quality of workmanship and attention to detail. A third is the marketplace; a 
gallery quality piece offered for sale in a roadside stand will command less 
than it would in a gallery. Part of the fun in the roadside purchase, where 
Makonde-style pieces often sell for $20 to $30, is the bartering. Sometimes 
competitors gather to listen to the bartering, and sometimes they suggest the 
buyer might do better in a neighboring stall. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleries rarely barter, although we were offered a discount (after we asked) 
in one Nairobi gallery in which we bought two carvings in the $275 to $325 
range -- one a Makonde spirit made of rosewood; the other of village elders 
sitting in a circle. Our savings amounted to about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 We found some of the best Makonde-style carvings in the upscale art galleries 
of Nairobi. It is worth noting that "good" galleries in Nairobi or elsewhere 
never are crammed with merchandise, but instead choose to give good display to 
quality pieces.  
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers need to be attentive to a number of factors in buying Makonde-style 
carvings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ebony trees are protected by governments in East Africa, and those that 
remain  
</P>
<P>
 are gnarled and twisted and do not lend themselves to carving. Unless you are 
in an antique shop, you probably are buying mpingo, or African blackwood. Like 
ebony, mpingo is also a heavy, dense black hardwood, and it is plentiful in 
East Africa. Some carvings also are done in teak and rosewood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buyers sometimes are told that they can tell if a carving "really is ebony" 
by scratching the bottom through any layers of black shoe polish that may have 
been applied to blacken the piece. But mpingo also remains black when scratched 
and, like ebony wood, is characterized by a black core surrounded by a much 
lighter bark. Even experts are perplexed by differentiating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buyers should inspect carvings for bad cuts, errant chisel marks, poor 
sanding or polishing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look also for flaws in the wood, particularly cracks. Both ebony and mpingo 
are fairly brittle. The best carvers select good wood and then build their 
pieces around flaws, incorporating the eccentricities of the wood into the 
final product. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for attention to detail, particularly very small detail, in any 
carving. A quality effort takes time, even in the most skilled hands, and an 
inspection of a carving for its detail, as well as its finish, is crucial to an 
enlightened purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 * Similarly, look for spaces between arms and torsos, or between legs. A piece 
that is solid (similar to bas-relief) rarely will have fine detail, and should 
not command the price of a more intricate carving. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nairobi, we found the Kumbu Kumbu gallery in the Hilton Shopping Arcade on 
Mama Ngina Street, or African Heritage on Kenyatta Avenue, to have excellent 
quality carvings at top prices. Shops in the nearby City Market on Muindi 
Mbingu Street offer a large selection, but careful inspection before purchase 
is recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for street corner vendors selling carvings, downtown Dar es Salaam 
offers less than might be expected on Samora Avenue, the main shopping street. 
But about eight miles north of Dar es Salaam, on Makami Road immediately off 
Bagamoyo Road, is a carvers' collective: the Mwenge Curio Shops in Mwenge 
village. The selection is vast, and the skill of the carvers is varied, but it 
is well worth the trip for a careful shopper who might also enjoy watching the 
carvers work the wood. Also nearby on Bagamoyo road is the Karibu Art Gallery, 
with a good selection, and the Village Museum, where carvers work among 
traditionally built villages. GUIDEBOOK: Details for Finding African Statues 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: British Airways, Air France, Swissair, KLM and Lufthansa all 
have connecting flights between LAX and Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, through 
various European cities. The best service between Nairobi and Dar is with Kenya 
Airways and Air Tanzania. Where to stay: In downtown Dar es Salaam, the best 
places are the Hotel Embassy (24 Garden Ave.), P.O. Box 3152, Dar es Salaam, 
Tanzania; from U.S., telephone 011-255-51-30006 or 30035; doubles about $71. 
</P>
<P>
 Motel Agip (Pamba Road), P.O. Box 529, Dar es Salaam; tel. 011-255-51-23511; 
doubles about $90. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilimanjaro Hotel, which overlooks the harbor, (Kivoukoni Front), Dar es 
Salaam; tel. 011-255-51-21281; doubles $79-$86. All of the above have 
air-conditioning and either a restaurant or bar. The Embassy and the 
Kilimanjaro have swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 In downtown Nairobi, Kenya, four excellent choices are the Hilton Hotel (on 
Mama Ngina Street near Moi Ave.), P.O. Box 30624, Nairobi; tel. 
011-254-2-334000; doubles to $168. 
</P>
<P>
 New Stanley Hotel (Kimathi Street and Kenyatta Avenue), P.O. Box 30680, 
Nairobi; tel. 011-254-2-33-3233; doubles to $94. 
</P>
<P>
 Norfolk Hotel (on Harry Thuko Road), P.O. Box 40064, Nairobi; tel. 
011-254-2-335422; doubles to $160, more for cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 Nairobi Serena Hotel (at the edge of Central Park between Kenyatta Avenue and 
Nyerere Road), P.O. Box 46302, Nairobi; tel. 011-254-2-725111; doubles to $175. 
</P>
<P>
 What to read: Makonde sculpture is included in half a dozen or more 
anthologies of African art. But I found an excellent book on the subject in the 
library: "Modern Makonde Art" by Jorn Korn (Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited, 
London; 1974). It covers the work of five Makonde artists who carve shitani. A 
broader but briefer description of Makonde carvings may be found in "Arts in 
East Africa" by Judith von D. Miller (Africana Publishing Co., 1975).

DESTINATION: MASSACHUSETTS; NOTES FROM THE BERKSHIRES; ORCHESTRATING CULTURE -- 
FROM TANGLEWOOD TO NORMAN ROCKWELL TO SHAKESPEARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SHEA, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dawn in the Berkshires. Well, maybe more like 9-ish. A haunting riff from a 
distant flute drifts across the meadow, flutters tantalizingly through the pine 
boughs above my head, then before I can catch it is lost in a crescendo of 
horns and strings. 
</P>
<P>
 A music student's dogged practice session has been momentarily eclipsed by a 
shirt-sleeve rehearsal of the entire Boston Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra will return in full dress that evening to enthrall hordes of 
music lovers on their annual pilgrimage to Tanglewood. Thousands enjoy the 
summer concerts -- this year June 26 through Sept. 4 -- from picnic blankets 
that cover almost every inch of the sprawling lawn within earshot of the Music 
Shed. They probably would sit on hot coals, if necessary. And though they don't 
show up in quite such numbers for the student recitals, Tanglewood audiences 
show the young performers the same reverence for their talent, which invariably 
is considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere this side of Camelot can you enjoy a more magically rejuvenating 
weekend than in the 20-mile radius around the tiny town of Lenox, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the centerpiece Tanglewood Music Festival, which in addition to the 
Boston Symphony includes guest orchestras and jazz and folk artists, as well as 
classical musicians, Lenox offers the Berkshire Opera Company and Shakespeare & 
Company productions at the Mount, the estate built by novelist Edith Wharton. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away in Stockbridge, there's the Stockbridge Summer Music Series 
and the Berkshire Theatre Festival. Great Barrington, about 10 miles south, 
offers the Aston Magna Festival of early music and the Stockbridge Chamber 
Music Concerts at historic Searles Castle. The Berkshire Choral Festival takes 
place a few miles farther south in Sheffield. The renowned Jacob's Pillow Dance 
Festival is about 10 miles east of Lenox in Becket. Venture about 20 miles 
north and you can include the acclaimed Williamstown Theatre Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these seasonal attractions, such as Tanglewood, offer outdoor open 
seating, workshop performances or lecture series that are much cheaper than the 
main events. And casual rehearsals, which often can be more absorbing than the 
finished product, generally are free. (The hills are alive with mosquitoes too, 
so be sure to pack insect repellent.) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Writers and artists have been coming to the western Massachusetts Berkshires 
for R&R since the middle of the last century, and when Newport started getting 
crowded, wealthy New Yorkers looking for vacation retreats converted old farms 
into grand Berkshire cottages. A number of these restored estates, such as 
Edith Wharton's, now are venues for this staggering array of culture in the 
country. The programs tend to run through Labor Day; some of the estates are 
open through the October foliage season. 
</P>
<P>
 In two days last summer I managed to take in one concert, two plays and 
snatches of countless rehearsals; visit several estates and museums; browse in 
numerous shops and galleries; dine memorably (at the Apple Tree Inn across the 
road from Tanglewood, Church Street Cafe in Lenox and the landmark Red Lion Inn 
in Stockbridge); hike along miles of trails, and still come away feeling more 
relaxed than I've been since about 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something profoundly restorative about the deep-green hillsides, which 
have remained lush when the rest of the Northeast looks, in comparison, like 
the Mojave Desert. I'm convinced that the towering trees, too, get nourishment 
from the daily infusions of Mozart and Mahler, though I'll concede it might 
also have something to do with the frequent mountain rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I wasn't sure how easy it would be to find central Berkshires lodging 
in midsummer, I turned to the American Country Collection of Bed & Breakfasts, 
a regional reservation service. They charge a $10 fee for the first night's 
booking, which covers any subsequent reservations within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 It was well worth it to be directed to Lenox' lovely Garden Gables Inn. Set 
back from Main Street amid five acres of gardens and trees, it gives the 
feeling of a faraway retreat while only a couple of blocks from the center of 
town. Tanglewood was about a mile away but down a long, steep hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Gables' gracious innkeepers, Mario and Lynn Mekinda, bought the 1780 
house seven years ago and offer 18 tastefully decorated rooms, some with 
fireplaces and private porches. The back-yard pool, a rarity in the Berkshires, 
is good-sized. Add a comfortable living room with TV for guests to catch up on 
news of the outside world, the pitcher of lemonade in the refrigerator and the 
delicious breakfast buffet, and I was ready to move in for good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Lenox and downtown Stockbridge and West Stockbridge,  
</P>
<P>
 for that matter, is little more than a country crossroads with a few inns, 
shops and restaurants, most in old houses. Lenox is the most like an 
unpretentious small town, rather than a resort. There are no traffic lights or 
parking limits, and the shops seem predominantly local ventures, including some 
nice clothing boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Antiques stores dot village streets and back roads throughout the area, among 
the general stores selling gourmet coffee along with bait and tackle. And 
Massachusetts 7, just outside Lenox village, has Lenox House Country Shops 
factory outlet stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Berkshires really aren't meant for shopaholics, who would have been as 
out of place as Martians in the world depicted by the area's most beloved 
artist, Norman Rockwell. His homespun covers for the Saturday Evening Post 
immortalized Stockbridge, where he lived and worked most of his later life, and 
the Norman Rockwell Museum, on an estate a couple of miles from town, displays 
a vast collection of his illustrations. His last studio was also moved to the 
site. Visitors can join frequent guided talks -- some even given by townspeople 
who served as models for Rockwell. There are picnic tables scattered around the 
grounds, which display sculpture by Rockwell's son, Peter. 
</P>
<P>
 I also enjoyed nearby Chesterwood, former home of sculptor Daniel Chester 
French, noted for the Lincoln Memorial and other public monuments. Works by 
contemporary sculptors are displayed around the grounds of this estate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 En route to a matinee at the Mount, I spent a peaceful hour walking in the 
terraced gardens at Naumkeag, a gabled mansion designed by Stanford White for 
Joseph Choate, ambassador to England at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mount has four theaters, two outdoors and two indoors. While I waited to 
enter the Italianate mansion to see adaptations of two stories by Edith 
Wharton, the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize, I watched actors romping 
through the surrounding woods rehearsing "Midsummer Night's Dream," presented 
outdoors in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another afternoon I drove about half an hour north to Hancock Shaker Village, 
which has numerous programs and demonstrations about life in this farming 
community established by the now-vanished sect that was committed to celibacy. 
I also went to Williamstown, about an hour north of Lenox, to visit its two 
outstanding museums, the Williams College Museum of Art and the Clark Art 
Institute. Both are free. GUIDEBOOK: Berkshire Bound 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: From LAX fly nonstop to Boston on American, United, Northwest; 
lowest round-trip fares start at about $460. From Boston, it is about a 
three-hour drive to the Berkshires; New York City, about 3 1/2 hours. Airports 
at Albany, N.Y., and Hartford, Conn., are each about a one-hour drive to the 
Berkshires. 
</P>

July-August and holiday weekends, two nights June, September-October. American 
Country Collection of Bed and Breakfasts, (518) 439-7001 ($10 fee for booking 
service); rooms in the Berkshires range from about $45 to $190.  
</P>
<P>
 What to do: Most house tours and museum admissions are $4 to $8. Plays and 
concerts, many of which run between now and Labor Day, $5 to $67 per person.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; CANADIAN ROCKIES IN FIVE BUS STOPS

<TEXT>
<P>
 After last year's successful summer, the Rocky Express budget bus service will 
once again take travelers on do-as-you-please weekly tours of the Canadian 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 True North Tours, in association with Hostelling Alberta, is offering 
five-night programs that depart each Sunday through October. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-seat passenger van picks up a maximum of 14 people from the Calgary and 
Banff hostels and transports them to a variety of activities in a different 
area of the Rockies each day. Stops include Lake Louise, the Columbia 
Icefields, Athabasca Falls and Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities range from hiking, canoeing, touring a glacier in an all-terrain 
vehicle, horseback riding, white-water rafting and biking. 
</P>
<P>
 Each evening the bus delivers passengers to a different hostel where beds have 
been reserved. Hostels range in price from $5.50 to $11 per night for dormitory 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 The price for the transportation is $94.50. Passengers must provide their own 
meals. All of the hostels have their own kitchens, and in some locations it is 
possible to dine out. 
</P>
<P>
 This tour is available to anyone, any age, whether they are members of an 
affiliated hostel association or not. 
</P>
<P>
 For further information, contact Banff International Hostel, P.O. Box 1358, 
Tunnel Mountain Road, Banff, Alberta T0L 0C0; telephone (800) 363-0096.

 Travelers using VIA Rail's unlimited travel Canrailpasses this year (including 
those buying the reduced youth or senior versions) will be getting an extra 
perk, a Hello Phone Pass (value $14) valid for complimentary long-distance 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canrailpass is valid for 12 days of coach-class rail travel within a 
30-day period, anywhere in Canada that VIA services. The regular price of a 
high season pass (June 1 to Sept. 30) is $357, travelers age 2 to 24 pay $322. 
The regular price during low season (Oct. 1 to Dec. 14) is $244, youths pay 
$223. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass holders are required to obtain tickets before boarding, and because the 
number of seats available to pass holders is limited, it is recommended that 
tickets be obtained early. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass holders are also offered discounts at Choice Hotels and a version of the 
Canrailpass, which includes three days of car rental. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers age 12 to 24 who buy tickets for VIA coach, first class or sleeping 
accommodation services are also eligible for a 10% discount throughout the 
system. For details see your travel agent.

 A selection of travel opportunities to the land Down Under -- Australia:  
</P>
<P>
 A Sunshine Rail Experience with seniors in mind is being promoted by the 
Australian state of Queensland, which boasts a land area 2 1/2 times the size 
of Texas. The six-day tour in air-conditioned, nonsmoking rail cars covers 
1,000 miles in segments of not more than five hours each day along the historic 
and scenic route on the Queensland coast. Scheduled overnight stops in coastal 
cities are in hotels or resorts. Tours run year-round beginning in Brisbane 
headed north or from Cairns traveling south. There are stops for motor-coach 
tours along the way. Two tour managers accompany each tour. 
</P>
<P>
 All meals are included throughout the trip aboard the train or at lodging 
stops, and tea service is included each morning and afternoon. The trip, with 
lodging and side trips, is priced according to season from $867 to $902 per 
person, double occupancy. Tipping is not required. Air transportation to 
Australia is not included. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also book pre- or post-rail tour extensions, which may include a stay 
at one of the coastal island resorts, cruising along the Great Barrier Reef, 
sightseeing in the Outback or the rain forests, or visiting the cities of 
Brisbane or Cairns. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on the Sunshine Rail Experience, call the Queensland Tourist 
Office in Los Angeles at (310) 788-0997. 
</P>
<P>
 Three moderately priced tours in Australia are available through Cosmos 
Tourama. One of the trips, "The Boomerang," is an escorted 15-day tour that 
begins in Sydney and visits Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Ayers Rock, Alice 
Springs, Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef. 
</P>

HIKING: CENTRAL COLORADO: BRISTLING WITH 'FOURTEENER FEVER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sculpted and stunted by wind and ice crystals, ancient bristlecone pines 
persevere in places where lesser conifers fail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the central Colorado Rockies, about a 1 1/2-hour drive southwest of Denver, 
and just south of Breckenridge, a preserve protects a grove of Pinus aristata , 
trees known to live for 2,000 years. Bristlecone Pine National Scenic Area, 
established by the U.S. Forest Service in 1964, is a great place to visit these 
Methuselahs of the plant world. 
</P>
<P>
 The bristlecones manage to survive at an elevation of 11,500 feet on 
well-named Windy Ridge. The winds from which the ridge gets its name sometimes 
reach speeds of 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 When you visit the trees, note their wind-influenced growth pattern: few buds 
and new branches are on the trees' windward sides, and what branches there are 
seem bare and worn. Those bristlecones braving Windy Ridge itself are severely 
stunted while those in the slightly more sheltered environment below the ridge 
reach 25 to 30 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Windy Ridge is also the trail head for the hike to Mt. Bross, the 22nd highest 
summit in the state at 14,172 feet. The rotund peak offers a challenging day 
hike because of its high altitude, though experienced hikers will probably 
judge it a relatively mild climb in comparison to treks to the tops of 
Colorado's other 14,000-foot peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 If, like me, you're afflicted with "fourteener fever" and absolutely have to 
scale a couple of Colorado's 14,000-foot summits, note the presence of three 
more peaks in the vicinity of Mt. Bross: Mt. Lincoln (14,286 feet), Mt. Cameron 
(14,238 feet) and Mt. Democrat (14,148 feet). Experienced hikers (some 
off-trail rock scrambling is required) can bag all four in one long day by 
heading for the trail head at Kite Lake. From Colorado 9 in the center of Alma, 
turn west on dirt Kite Lake Road and drive six miles to Kite Lake and the 
signed trail head. 
</P>
<P>
 More outdoor fun beckons in Park County, which has more territory above 9,000 
feet than any other Colorado county. Among the activities are terrific fishing 
and camping and auto tours to ghost towns and historic mining towns. Stop at 
the Pike National Forest office in Fairplay to inquire about local trail and 
road conditions, and ask for brochures for the three self-guided driving tours 
of nearby historical mining areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Colorado 9 in Alma (at 10,350 feet, the highest 
incorporated town in North America and six miles north of Fairplay), head 
uphill (west) on Buckskin Gulch Road. Drive 6 1/2 miles up the graded dirt 
road, following the signs to Windy Ridge and the Bristlecone Pines National 
Scenic Area. A half-mile before the road reaches the bristlecones, it comes to 
shallow Dolly Varden Creek. If your car is low slung, park before the creek 
crossing. If your vehicle has high clearance, forge ahead the last half mile to 
the parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: After visiting the bristlecone pines, you can either head straight 
up the steep and rocky slopes of Mt. Bross or follow a four-wheel drive road 
that switchbacks up the mountain. The road climbs two miles or so to the Dolly 
Varden Mine at 13,300 feet. From here, you make your own way up the 
scree-covered slopes to the flat summit of Mt. Bross. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy the near views of the Mosquito Range -- that part of the Rockies that 
includes Mt. Bross and its cousins, and more far-reaching views up and down the 
Continental Divide. Mt. Bross Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Bristlecone Pine National Scenic Area, Pike National Forest, south of 
Breckenridge, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 7 miles round trip from the bristlecones to the top of Mt. Bross 
with a 2,700-foot elevation gain. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Scree-covered peak near Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Ancient bristlecone pine groves. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Strenuous because of altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTIONS: High-altitude hiking and short visitor season (mid- to late 
summer). 
</P>

TAKING THE KIDS: A WALK ON YOSEMITE'S WET SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ, Ogintz is author of Taking the Kids to the Great Southwest 
(HarperCollins West, $9.95). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rocks were slick from the thunderous spray and the climb was the steepest 
we'd ever attempted. Matt and I looked at each other apprehensively. Should we 
continue to the top or head back down? "Come on!," Reggie urged impatiently. 
"When else can you climb to the top of a waterfall?" she demanded, leading the 
way up Yosemite's famous Mist Trail hiking path to the top of Vernal Fall. We 
had no choice but to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a spectacular, though admittedly scary experience to climb alongside 
rushing water from the Merced River plunging down the mountain about 317 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, a rainbow!" Reggie said excitedly. And there it was, as unmistakable as 
those she likes to draw with her markers. 
</P>
<P>
 We visited in the spring when the falls are at their strongest from melting 
mountain snow. We gawked at Yosemite Falls, at 2,425 feet one of the highest in 
the world. We got soaked at Bridalveil Fall. Legend has it, we were told, that 
spirits who live at Bridalveil get their kicks from drenching everyone who 
comes close. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere did we appreciate the power and the beauty of Yosemite more than 
climbing alongside Vernal Fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The first part of the hike is easy. Even a preschooler could manage the 
portion to Vernal Fall bridge that provides a good vantage point to view the 
fall. No wonder the 7/10ths of a mile hike to the bridge is among the most 
popular in the park. Don't be fooled, though. It's only another half mile to 
the top but we wondered if we'd ever get there. "Not too much farther," hikers 
coming down kept reassuring us. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, we toasted our accomplishment over a sumptuous dinner at the historic 
Ahwahnee Hotel in its 130-foot-long dining room. (Dinner reservations are a 
must. Call 209-372-1489. Men are now welcome in sweaters or collared shirts.) 
Matt grudgingly admitted dinner was worth getting dressed up for -- especially 
after the waiters made a fuss over his hiking feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing in that Gargantuan room with my well-scrubbed and, for once, 
well-behaved children beside me -- all of us glowing from the afternoon's 
exercise -- I felt totally at peace. If only motherhood could always be this 
rewarding, I thought. No wonder naturalist John Muir dedicated much of his life 
to Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing about Yosemite, we discovered over a weekend visit, is that there's 
plenty to satisfy everyone in the family, no matter what the age, stamina or 
interest. There are 250 miles of roads and 800 miles of hiking trails offering 
a variety of experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of families opt to bike, and bikes and helmets may be rented. Many 
families camp and backpack. (Call 800-365-2267 for MISTIX reservations.) 
</P>
<P>
 Drive to Glacier Point for what many say is one of the best views of the 
entire valley. Stay to see the moon rise. Take a stroll out to Mirror Lake for 
a good look at the famed Half Dome. Look for wildlife -- bighorn sheep and 
red-tailed hawks in the mountains: mule deer (thus named because of their big 
ears) chipmunks, coyotes, all kinds of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Spend a morning hiking through the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. Check out 
the California Tunnel Tree with a huge tunnel carved through it and the 
209-foot high Grizzly Giant. 
</P>
<P>
 A good resource for the hiking family is "Easy Day Hikes in Yosemite" by 
Deborah Durkee ($4.50, The Yosemite Assn.; 209-379-2648). 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of ranger programs to choose from that are designed with 
children's interests in mind. In the summer, stop at Happy Isles Nature Center, 
near where the trail leading to Vernal Fall begins, and sign up to become a 
junior ranger. Check out the special kids' activities and environmental 
programs at LeConte Memorial, a short drive away from Happy Isles. Spend time 
exploring the Pioneer Yosemite History Center at the south end of the park near 
the Wawona Hotel. In summer months, volunteers dress in period costume and 
portray early Yosemite residents. Stop at the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center in 
Yosemite Village to find out which children's programs are being offered. (Call 
209-372-0200 for general park information.) 
</P>
<P>
 Be forewarned that Yosemite gets very crowded in the summer -- to the tune of 
more than 600,000 people in July alone. Since reservations can be hard to come 
by, here are a couple of tips from Yosemite officials for getting them: 
</P>
<P>
 * If you want to stay over a weekend, plan to arrive during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call for reservations on Saturdays and Sundays. (For Yosemite reservations, 
call 209-252-4848.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Call 30, 15 or 7 days in advance of arrival. These are common dates when 
rooms held by previous reservations are canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Yosemite is one of the few places in my book that's worth extraordinary 
effort. Reggie thinks so too. Before we left, she bought a stuffed raccoon. She 
named him Vernal -- after the waterfall. He's got the place of honor on her 
bed.

 In reading your article titled "Minding Motion Sickness" (May 8), by Kathleen 
Doheny, I was surprised that ginger was not mentioned. A time-honored and 
highly effective remedy (recognized for centuries in Asia), it is a natural 
preventive as well as providing relief for nausea, food poisoning and morning 
sickness.

 Three years ago, we found the solution to seasickness: "Sea Bands." They are 
wristlets that use acupressure to stop motion sickness. My husband suffers from 
motion sickness, so going for a boat ride was out of the question. He couldn't 
read on an airplane. The "Sea Bands" have made travel and reading possible.

 I have a cure for motion sickness that really sounds silly, but it works. 
Years ago, I was sailing from Acapulco and I was sick before we even got out of 
the harbor. A young man told me to lie on my stomach. It worked. As long as I 
laid on my stomach I was OK. As soon as I raised up I was sick again. I have 
tested this many times and I have told others as they were beginning to get 
sick. They tried it and it worked.

TALES FROM TRUCKEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dianne Klein obviously feels a fondness for Truckee that I don't. ("Truckee 
Stop," May 15). I drove into Truckee last winter just as a snowstorm 
hit.Instead of risking the drive up a steep hill in the snow with my wife and 
2-year-old daughter in the car, I parked in the Safeway lot and asked the 
people we came to visit to pick us up in their four-wheel-drive vehicle. 
Despite our friend's assurance that the lot was a safe place to park for the 
night, I wasn't terribly surprised to return the next morning to find the car 
had been towed. I was disgusted to learn, however, that the ransom to retrieve 
my car after a tow of less than a mile was $230! There is a difference between 
depending on tourists for income and preying on them. Truckee, at least in this 
instance, clearly sanctions the latter.

ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I must comment on recent letters in the Travel section. It seems many 
Americans think the world is one big Disneyland.One letter explained that Petra 
should have a shuttle system ("Letters," March 27). The best way to see Petra 
is to walk in. One of my fondest memories is walking in at sunrise and seeing 
the color changes on the rose-colored walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The article about the Orient Express ("On Different Tracks," May 8) shows how 
truly ugly Americans can be. The best way to meet Thais and see Thailand is in 
second class. It also allows you to meet other travelers and exchange stories. 
</P>
<P>
 And lastly to the woman who won't visit Singapore ("Letters," May 22): too bad 
for her. If all Americans think they can be rescued after committing crimes in 
foreign countries, get real. Singapore is a great place to visit and we could 
learn a lot from them.

WHEN WELFARE WORKS; MORE GOOD NEWS COMES OUT OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY'S SUCCESSFUL 
PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welfare reform is not an oxymoron. Government programs for poor people can, 
and indeed must, be made to work better than they do now. That's why the recent 
release of the latest promising results from California's Greater Avenues to 
Independence welfare-to-work program was noteworthy. So was the positive 
report's timing: It coincided with, though it was eclipsed by, the release last 
week of the long-promised Clinton Administration welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington can learn a lot from GAIN. This powerful and innovative program 
works. It helps welfare recipients get education, training and jobs. Though 
relatively expensive, it saves government money. Every dollar that government 
invested in the Riverside County GAIN effort, the state's most successful 
program, returned $2.84 in welfare savings in the long run and a large earnings 
gain for participants.  
</P>
<P>
 This encouraging news comes from a final evaluation of GAIN by the Manpower 
Demonstration Research Corp., famed for designing and studying programs that 
help disadvantaged people. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the experiences of 33,000 welfare recipients in six counties, the 
research group found that GAIN participants, mainly poor, single mothers, did 
better than recipients not in the program.  
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County posted the most impressive results. Unlike most counties, it 
had enough resources to help all eligible recipients. For instance, mothers of 
preschool children were not excluded. They are hard to help because often they 
can't afford or find decent child care. But they succeeded under GAIN. 
</P>
<P>
 GAIN also worked for welfare mothers who had received Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children for six years or longer and for women without skills and 
thus often difficult to employ.  
</P>
<P>
 Changing behavior is hard. Another welfare program evaluated by the research 
corporation was much less successful. New Chance, a federal demonstration 
project in California and nine other states, encouraged young mothers who were 
school dropouts to finish school and find jobs. Slightly more than 40% did go 
to work, but the majority quit because of low wages or they wanted to stay home 
with their children. More than 80% were on welfare 18 months later.  
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age school dropouts are the most difficult recipients to move from 
welfare to work. But, as GAIN proves, incremental success is possible. Although 
the GAIN program didn't push every participant completely off of welfare, it 
started many toward independence with a boost in skills, and part-time earnings 
that the state allows them to keep as an incentive to get off of welfare. All 
this progress is worth noting in California -- and Washington.

BUT CAN THEY PULL AN UPSET AGAIN?

<P>
 Soccer fans in this country probably still don't quite believe what has come 
to pass in the 15th World Cup tournament, the first ever held in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not referring to the many Americans who are casual about soccer, 
focusing on the game as they do the Olympics -- every four years when the world 
gathers for a big event.We're talking true believers, the hard core that 
follows the game as the staunchest foreign soccer fans do. 
</P>
<P>
 For many -- even with three days to celebrate the remarkable 2-1 upset the 
U.S. national team scored Wednesday afternoon in Pasadena's Rose Bowl over 
soccer power and pre-tournament favorite Colombia -- the achievement no doubt 
still seems more like a wonderful dream than reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer experts are nearly unanimous in proclaiming the U.S. victory the most 
significant upset in World Cup history -- the day the world's favorite sport 
got the attention, and perhaps even won acceptance, in the United States. And 
that victory set up yet another big game today in the same historic stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for the talented American team is Romania, and a win or a tie 
guarantees the U.S. team a spot in the tournament's next round. Today's game 
will even be on network television, showcasing the sport before the nation, to 
the delight of aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 So here's hoping for another great game by the American team, and continued 
success in a tournament that is getting to be more exciting with each passing 
day. Our World Cup truly runneth over!

 As the details of O.J. Simpson's history of spousal abuse unfolded last week, 
Alan Bush felt the jittery craving of an alcoholic watching someone get drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear about battering going on, you feel it," said Bush, a 
42-year-old grocery store manager whose violent behavior toward women began in 
high school. "It's an addiction. The feeling of going after my wife is kind of 
always there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush has no idea whether the former football star killed his wife. But for men 
like him, the now famous 911 tape of Simpson bellowing in rage and his wife 
whimpering in fear brings back feelings of dread that if someone had not 
stepped in and stopped them, their own wives would be dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the last time I did this to Mary I was trying to kill her," added Jim, 
a 39-year-old computer systems director, who severely beat his wife in their 
Irvine home in September. "She did call the police the first two times, and 
nothing came out of it. They talked to me and threatened to arrest me. The 
third time, I just really wanted it over with, whatever it took." 
</P>
<P>
 What it took to stop men like Jim, Bush and increasing numbers of others like 
them was a court-ordered group therapy program, a treatment similar to 
Alcoholics Anonymous for batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 Spouse abusers have long been the criminal justice system's hot potatoes, and 
no one has quite figured out how to cool them off. For years, if a man happened 
to kill his wife in a jealous rage, it was not a brutal homicide, but a 
"domestic" incident given short shrift by police, prosecutors and judges and 
buried in the back pages of the local paper, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was still a family problem, usually knocked down to manslaughter," said 
Bill Thomas, director of Options Counseling, a program for batterers in 
Fullerton and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas and others said the Simpson case -- and the leniency shown him by 
authorities after earlier domestic disputes -- has focused attention on the 
treatment given to men who abuse their wives and girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence experts say when a batterer is not held accountable for his 
behavior because authorities fail to intervene in a "family matter," it is easy 
for him to minimize the seriousness of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you don't believe (the abuse) is OK, you believe there are no logical 
consequences," said Alice La Violette, director of Alternatives to Violence, 
which runs counseling groups for batterers from Orange and Los Angeles 
counties. "You think, 'The system's on my side. This is no big deal. No one 
ever did anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most judges now send first-time spouse abusers, men such as Jim and Bush, to 
anger-management classes or therapy groups for batterers once a week for at 
least nine months, Thomas said. The penalty for absenteeism: 180 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. got ripped off because he was never forced to go to a group," said Bush, 
42, the Long Beach grocery store manager. "If he was forced to go to my group 
-- one day a week for a solid year -- this wouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim, who is in the midst of a divorce and recently moved to Sacramento, 
credits a court-ordered anger management program run by Human Options, a 
shelter for battered women in South Orange County, for teaching him how to 
control his rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim said he and his wife had been married for 17 years before he slapped her 
the first time last March, angry that she had not paid the bills on time. Two 
months later, while drunk, he beat her again while their two children, a girl, 
17, and a boy, 11, looked on, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing was ever resolved and the issue kept coming back, and every time it 
came back it was worse," he said. "As a former Marine, I knew I could develop 
those type of rages. But I did not know I could develop them toward her. It 
scared me. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems was I didn't know where to go for help. I didn't even 
know who to ask. It was not something you talked about." 
</P>
<P>
 The third time Jim began to beat his wife, his daughter called the police. Jim 
was charged with nine misdemeanor counts -- one charge each of assault, battery 
and spousal abuse for each time he beat his wife, he said. The judge sentenced 
him to 20 days of community service, three years of probation and a program for 
batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What made me capable of talking about it in the group is that others had had 
the same feelings," Jim said. "I don't know that I will ever really understand 
what happened. But I know what the warning signs are when I get angry. Now I 
walk away. It's the easiest thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, who said he comes from an abusive home, remembered first striking his 
wife when the couple were high school sweethearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was simple. I would start nit-picking things she did that I didn't like. 
It just evolves into finally striking someone," he said. "They get immune to 
you, so you have to go to the next step. You have to find a new way to keep 
them under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush said the group taught him how he was controlling his wife and justifying 
his own increasingly violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "You beat them so badly they don't have any self-esteem," he said. "They 
really end up taking responsibility for their own battering: 'If you wouldn't 
do that, you wouldn't get hit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's wife delivered an ultimatum after 15 years of abuse -- either seek 
counseling for his battering or she would leave him. Alternatives to Violence 
saved both his life and his wife's, Bush said. And it is still helping. After 3 
1/2 years away from the group, Bush said he went back six months ago when he 
felt the old feelings returning. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me my stomach really rumbles, and I get really hot and sweaty and I feel 
my mind spinning really fast and I don't feel fully in control," Bush said. 
"Nowadays, when my stomach starts to turn I know, 'whoops, I need to do 
something.' We run back to our group when we need a tune-up." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being an alcoholic," he said. "The rush of hitting somebody. I 
enjoyed hitting people. I have a lot of power over that demon now."

SPOUSAL ABUSE IS RARELY PROSECUTED AS A FELONY IN O.C.; CRIME: STATISTICS 
INDICATE AN ABSENCE OF VIGOROUS PURSUIT OF CASES IN THE COUNTY -- 95% OF 
ARRESTS END UP AS MISDEMEANORS. D.A. SAYS OVERALL DATA IS INCOMPLETE. 
</P>

<P>
 At a time when local domestic violence complaints are soaring at record rates, 
state crime statistics show that the Orange County district attorney's office 
has the worst record among prosecutors in the state's six most-populous 
counties for vigorously pursuing spousal abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years for which state figures are available, the office of 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi elected to file the smallest percentage of cases 
as felonies, had the lowest conviction rate in those felony cases -- 52.4% -- 
and succeeded in putting the smallest percentage of serious offenders in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times investigation revealed that more than 95% of the felony spousal abuse 
arrests in Orange County ended up being filed in court as misdemeanors, giving 
Orange County the lowest felony filing rate -- 4.2% -- among the state's top 
six counties. In comparison, San Diego County, which comes closest to Orange 
County in terms of population and demographics, has a felony filing rate nearly 
four times higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence counselors and those concerned over battered wives have 
fought for years to get the criminal justice system to take spousal abuse more 
seriously. But it has taken the double-murder case against former football 
great O.J. Simpson to finally focus public attention on the nation's epidemic 
of spousal abuse -- and the legal system's response to it. 
</P>
<P>
 California law gives prosecutors the option of filing spousal abuse cases 
either as felonies, punishable by prison terms of two to four years for 
first-time offenders, or as misdemeanors, which can only be punished with 
relatively shorter stays in the county jail, or with probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, Capizzi dismissed the statistical comparisons -- 
which echoed similar findings of a recent Times investigation revealing that 
his office had the poorest record among the six most-populous counties for 
prosecuting rape -- saying that the state's statistical data was incomplete. He 
also said the state statistics are unsuitable for comparisons between counties 
-- an assertion that is contradicted by recognized criminologists and disputed 
by state justice department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said he is proud of the way his office has handled spousal abuse 
cases, and said a special prosecution unit he created 15 months ago is cracking 
down on individuals who batter their mates. He said his office is doing the 
best it can with limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we do well in that area with the caseload that's presented to us. We 
are constantly striving to do better," Capizzi said. "As a result of (the new 
unit), we are much stronger in our handling of those cases. We are able to give 
them more individualized attention, and that was the purpose in creating that 
unit." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, however, say the figures raise troubling questions about how 
seriously prosecutors treat spousal abuse cases that are often a critical 
predictor of escalating violence -- and even murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these are abysmal figures, and they certainly look like Orange County 
has not faced the fact that domestic abuse is a serious crime," said Dr. 
Mildred Kaley Pagelow, a Cal State Fullerton professor who has researched 
domestic abuse for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of spousal abuse in Orange County have skyrocketed over the past five 
years for which official statistics are available. The numbers are growing at a 
pace 65% higher than the state as a whole, and 20% faster than in Los Angeles 
County, which saw a slight decrease in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Orange County police agencies have been arresting adults and 
juveniles for spousal abuse at a rate that is increasing virtually twice as 
fast as statewide and five times faster than in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for the dramatic increases are unclear, although some speculate that 
increased spousal abuse may be linked to the economic downturn and to an 
increased awareness of the problem and willingness to call police. 
</P>
<P>
 The most troubling statistic shows that deadly domestic violence is also on 
the rise in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state figures, 19 men and women were killed in 1993 in domestic 
violence cases in Orange County, an increase of five over the number just five 
years ago. At the same time, homicides linked to domestic abuse in Los Angeles 
County and the state reportedly declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Capizzi -- and by extension, Orange County -- has been slow to 
recognize and combat spousal abuse and domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some note that there are more shelters for abused animals in Orange County 
than there are facilities for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long before (Orange County) established a special prosecution unit, other 
counties had already done that," Pagelow said. "There's just been no special 
emphasis on these cases." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the state's first pilot programs for prosecuting spousal abuse was 
started in Los Angeles in 1985, while the district attorney's office there 
created a full-fledged unit 1 1/2 years ago. San Diego started a program in 
1988 and has since become a nationwide model. Both jurisdictions boast a higher 
percentage of felony filings, higher conviction rates, and a higher rates of 
incarceration for spousal abuse than Orange County, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The data used in The Times' comparisons comes from the California Department 
of Justice, which collects statistics on crime and punishment from every law 
enforcement agency, prosecutor's office and courthouse in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The data tracks felony spousal abuse arrests, the recommendations to 
prosecutors of the arresting agencies, prosecutors' filing of the cases either 
as felonies or misdemeanors, and the outcome of those cases once they are 
adjudicated in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending his office's handling of spousal abuse cases, Capizzi said there 
are many factors that can distort the picture given by felony arrest 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said prosecutors face a higher burden than police officers, who 
frequently consider a case to be a felony at the time of arrest, when a later 
and more thorough evaluation of the evidence by prosecutors dictates that it 
should be treated as a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can arrest for probable cause," he said. "Many times there is a felony 
probable cause arrest, and when the liaison officer comes in, they will say 
this is not a felony, it should be a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we see them as a misdemeanor, we will file it as a misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
 But the overwhelming reduction of felony arrests to misdemeanor charges shows 
that prosecutors are disregarding police judgment, Pagelow said. Years ago, she 
said, the problem in spousal abuse cases typically involved police who refused 
to arrest abusive husbands -- or boyfriends who, under California law, can 
sometimes be defined as spouses -- in about 95% of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, they make that call (and make an arrest), but it's not prosecuted as a 
felony," she said. "When the charge is a misdemeanor, the message very often is 
that this is nothing to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said his office doesn't underestimate what is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we wanted to see a more aggressive stance on these cases, and 
that's why we started the unit," he said. "These cases just tug at you to see 
that we have to do something to deal with these cases before they turn into a 
homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say that every domestic dispute case, regardless of the severity 
of any injuries, presents an opportunity to try to break the cycle of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in cases where there is evidence of prior violence and repeat offenses, 
the criminal justice system as a whole often allows offenders to escape the 
most serious punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, the case of James Calvin Wilkes, 46, of Garden Grove, 
who was charged with misdemeanor injury to his spouse in January, 1991, and was 
arrested again for slashing his wife with a machete before the first case was 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that while awaiting trial for the machete attack, Wilkes was 
sentenced to informal probation for the first offense. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he pleaded guilty to felony charges in the machete attack, he was 
again sentenced to probation -- even though he had a prior conviction for 
voluntary manslaughter, a shooting death in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested for violating his probation, and faced a possible 
five-year prison sentence, he was instead sent to Orange County Jail for one 
year, getting credit for six months already spent in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi's domestic violence unit has two prosecutors and one investigator 
devoted full time to felony spousal abuse cases, while two deputies in each of 
the county's five courthouses handle misdemeanor domestic violence cases in 
addition to their routine caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 Each spousal abuse case is reviewed individually, and prosecutors take into 
consideration the victim's injuries and the defendant's prior record. Repeat 
offenders are not automatically charged with felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade said the unit cannot handle all cases 
stemming from domestic violence but concentrates on the most serious and 
difficult cases, such as those involving several charges, or reluctant 
witnesses, or stalking. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is currently revamping its system of record-keeping to be able to 
track domestic abuse cases, Shade said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said many felony arrests are properly filed as misdemeanors, and she 
personally reviews all spousal abuse case rejections to make sure the decision 
not to prosecute was correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take these charges very, very seriously," said Shade, who added that she 
considers domestic violence cases to be "homicide prevention" cases. "There is 
discretion involved, but that's what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clara County, prosecutors have used their discretion to file a much 
higher percentage of felonies. The felony filing rate there is nearly five 
times that of Orange County, and its felony conviction rate is 54% higher. 
Nearly 50% more of those convicted of spousal abuse in Santa Clara County end 
up with some form of incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara district attorney's office opened its domestic violence unit 
in late 1990, said Rolanda Pierre-Dixon, the head of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that difficult to file a felony case," she said. "You've got a woman 
with a broken bone, or someone who has been hospitalized or there's some 
lethality involved. In those cases, I will file a felony. But there's an old 
saying: 'A bad felony does not make for a good misdemeanor.' You've got to have 
a good case, and we pursue good cases here." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County has one of the nation's model programs for prosecuting 
domestic violence cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney has nine deputies, and the district attorney's office has 12 
prosecutors, who do nothing but track felony and misdemeanor spousal abuse 
cases. The San Diego Police Department has 24 detectives and three sergeants 
devoted to such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the largest specialized felony domestic violence unit in the 
country," said Casey G. Gwinn, head deputy city attorney and supervising 
attorney of the domestic violence unit. "We've gone far but still have a long 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 While more than one-fourth of the cases rejected for prosecution in Orange 
County are explained as "victim unavailable/declines to testify," San Diego has 
a policy of pressing ahead with charges -- even with an uncooperative victim -- 
once the unit has taken the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Orange County law enforcement agencies have officers who specialize in 
domestic dispute cases, but many departments do not. All insist that they take 
domestic violence seriously, but also say that it is not always realistic to 
pursue felony prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said his department does not have a special 
unit to handle such cases, but a civilian employee acts as a liaison with 
prosecutors to provide assistance. Helton said the biggest problem is reluctant 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many victims are unwilling to proceed with a criminal case because they are 
fearful, do not want to lose the family breadwinner, nor do they want to face 
more turmoil in their family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald E. Smallwood was the driving force 
behind the creation of a county task force on domestic violence about a year 
ago. Smallwood said he expects the panel to produce detailed recommendations 
for tackling the problem in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area that has not been given the attention (it should have 
received) by prosecutors and the courts, and has just been soft-peddled over 
the years," he said, adding that he believes that holds true for the nation, 
not just Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical because this is the one area where we can make such a 
tremendous difference," he said, adding that he estimates one killing in Orange 
County each month can be traced to domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said it is also unfair to blame his office for sentencing of spousal 
abusers. Prosecutors recommend a sentence but cannot force a judge to impose 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some judges in the county who hand down sentences for spousal abuse 
that are too lenient for his tastes, he said, but declined to identify them or 
say whether his prosecutors take advantage of a legal procedure that would 
allow them to avoid taking spousal abuse cases before those judges. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his prosecutors do all they can "to the extent we can influence the 
sentence, create a higher percentage of cases going to prison and a higher 
level of prison commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 Shade said prison is not always an appropriate sentence. Often, she said, 
prosecutors try to seek sentences that combine jail and therapy in an attempt 
to break the patterns of abuse. When possible, abusers are sent to a 32-session 
counseling program that focuses on stopping abuse before it starts again. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, there are very few defendants in spousal abuse cases that 
deserve prison," said Shade. "What we are interested in is breaking the chain 
of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, president of the Women's Equal Rights 
Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the Legislature clearly designated 
spousal abuse law as a crime punishable as a felony if there is evidence of 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Orange County prosecutors are undermining the Legislature's intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're basically saying, 'we'll wait until this guy beats you half to death 
before we do anything,' " said Allred, who said this is especially critical 
because studies show domestic violence almost always escalates in severity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Battered women need and deserve legal protection," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred said -- and Judge Smallwood agreed -- that domestic violence would be 
taken more seriously if the traditional victims were men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe there is a gender bias at work here," Smallwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shade said the unit is dedicated to making sure that trained prosecutors get 
justice for victims of spousal abuse, and said the office's record for doing so 
is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our response continues to get better and better," Shade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Tom Boylan, who supervises the crimes against persons unit of the Costa 
Mesa Police Department, was startled by the statistics and said, "they do not 
look that good (considering) the seriousness of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The data, however, is only available through 1992, a few months before the 
Orange County district attorney's office set up its domestic violence unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan cautioned that the situation might have improved since then. "Our D.A. 
has been fairly aggressive in this area," he said. "I think they are making a 
substantial effort today." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Jaruszewski, community outreach director at Interval House, a 55-bed 
shelter for battered women, said the number of victims she sees continues to 
grow. "We are always filled. We always have a waiting list. People are talking 
about O.J., O.J., and I'm saying, Where have all these people been? This 
happens every day." 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the Orange County homicides linked to domestic abuse in the last 
year, law enforcement authorities were on alert that the alleged assailant 
could be dangerous: 
</P>
<P>
 * Camp Pendleton military police responded twice to quell domestic 
disturbances at the home of Tina and Jeffrey Gibson, a decorated Persian Gulf 
War veteran, but Gibson was never jailed or disciplined. Shortly after their 
divorce, Gibson allegedly murdered his ex-wife in San Clemente in May, 1993, 
before allegedly shooting to death his 5-year-old daughter and seriously 
injuring another woman in the apartment. Gibson has pleaded not guilty and 
faces trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anaheim city prosecutors charged Ysrael Jacoba Cordova, 36, with misdemeanor 
spousal abuse for an April, 1993, attack on his longtime companion, Rebecca Ann 
Cruz. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. After his 
release, he attacked Cruz again. Although he was booked on felony charges, 
Orange County prosecutors filed the case as a misdemeanor. He again pleaded 
guilty to spousal abuse, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail. In February of 
this year, Cordova was charged with bursting into Cruz's Anaheim home, fatally 
shooting her boyfriend, and threatening to kill Cruz before she fled out a back 
door. Cordova faces trial on murder charges later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Spousal abuse cases are often troubling ones for the legal system -- 
presenting difficulties not unlike those in rape cases. Victims are often 
reluctant to testify. The defendant often tries to blame the victim. Some 
jurors might be hesitant to convict someone in what many still see as a family 
dispute to be settled behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Rodriguez, a senior counselor at Interval House, said she is frustrated 
by the number of cases that are treated as misdemeanors by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think the very first offense should be considered a felony 
before it's looked at as a misdemeanor," Rodriguez said. "If it's a 
misdemeanor, these guys are basically given a fine or jail time, and its 
usually time served. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system doesn't seem to work sometimes," she said. "Sometimes, its just a 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Mark Landsbaum, Dan Weikel, Mark Platte and Richard 
O'Reilly, as well as library researcher Sheila Kern and computer analyst Sandy 
Poindexter, contributed to this report. Spousal Abuse: How Orange County 
Compares 
</P>
<P>
 Among the state's six-most populous counties, Orange County police arrest 
fewer individuals for spousal abuse, but generally seek the harshest punishment 
for those they do arrest. County prosecutors, however, pursue the smallest 
percentage of cases as felonies, electing instead to file the cases as 
misdemeanors. Very few defendants are ever sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During 1990-92, the most recent period for which figures are available, Orange 
County police and sheriff's deputies made the smallest number of spousal abuse 
arrests per 100 reported cases. County: Rate Los Angeles: 27.4 Santa Clara: 
27.2 San Bernardino: 24.2 San Diego: 16.5 Alameda: 11.9 Orange: 11.6 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Orange County police and deputies make fewer arrests, they seek 
felony punishment in more than nine out of 10 cases they bring to the district 
attorney. County: Percent Santa Clara: 44.0% Los Angeles: 52.3% Orange: 93.2% 
Alameda: 95.1% San Bernardino: 99.5% San Diego: 99.7% * 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, district attorneys can file spousal-abuse cases either 
as felonies--generally punishable by two to four years in state prison--or 
misdemeanors punishable by no more than a year in jail, or probation, or both 
jail and probation. Here's the percentage of cases district attorneys of the 
most populous counties filed as felonies: County: Percent Santa Clara: 19.5% 
San Diego: 15.8% San Bernardino: 13.9% Los Angeles: 9.4% Alameda: 8.2% Orange: 
4.2% * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors generally win a smaller percentage of spousal-abuse 
cases than do their counterparts in the other counties at both the felony and

 Domestic violence calls are an increasing problem for Orange County police. In 
both Los Angeles County and statewide, the 1989-93 increases are smaller than

RIORDAN IS INVESTOR IN FIRM WITH METRO RAIL CONTRACT; ETHICS: MAYOR'S RELATED 
ACTIONS MAY HAVE VIOLATED CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST LAW, EXPERTS SAY. HE DEFENDS HIS 
ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who pledged during his campaign to separate 
his substantial business holdings from any official actions, helped win 
approval last year for a rail project that has brought hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to a company in which he holds a major stake, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's action, undertaken in his role as a board member of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, may have violated state conflict-of-interest law, 
according to legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said in an interview that he sought the funding for the commuter rail 
project to resolve a dispute among MTA board members and had no inkling that 
the company could benefit. In response to questions posed by The Times, the 
mayor said that an attorney on his staff has advised him that he did not 
violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, Riordan won funding for the rail project between Downtown Los 
Angeles and Pasadena, activating a $1.05-million contract held by Tetra Tech 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, a multimillionaire lawyer and investor, owns $9.75 million of stock 
in the Pasadena-based engineering services company, his largest holding. 
</P>
<P>
 During his campaign for mayor a year ago, Riordan said he would place his 
private holdings in a blind trust "to avoid any potential conflicts of 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
 "Furthermore," he added, "I will remove myself from situations where potential 
conflicts of interest may arise." Records show that the head of the blind 
trust, established as of July, 1993, sits on the board of directors of Tetra 
Tech, along with one of Riordan's other venture capital partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who accepts only $1 a year of his city salary, referred questions 
regarding the operation of the blind trust to others. He said that members of 
his staff have sought to steer him clear of conflicts of interest with his 
personal holdings, valued at $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As mayor, Riordan sits on the MTA board and appoints three other people to the 
13-member panel. No other official controls as many appointments to the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The viability of the Pasadena rail line was in jeopardy last year when Riordan 
moved to save it. Citing an operating budget shortfall of $126 million and a 
capital budget deficit of $170 million, MTA staff had recommended delaying or 
killing the proposed 13.6-mile railway. 
</P>
<P>
 An Aug. 3, 1993, staff memo to Franklin E. White, the MTA's chief executive 
officer, warned that undertaking costly new rail construction would be "a 
highly dangerous course of action," adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no money for new rail lines and will not be for at least a decade. 
This means that we must postpone indefinitely all work on the Pasadena line . . 
. and all other rail lines that are not currently under way." 
</P>
<P>
 White privately recommended delaying or scrapping the Pasadena line, according 
to people familiar with those conversations. But the chief executive, who had 
joined the agency a few months earlier, relented when urged by MTA Chairman 
Richard Alatorre, a city councilman whose district would be partly served by 
the new line. 
</P>
<P>
 White agreed to propose $40 million in funding to mollify Alatorre, sources 
told The Times. But then Riordan introduced an amendment to the agency's budget 
committing $97 million of MTA funds toward completion of final design 
engineering work for the project and authorizing preliminary construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned, I think we all should be, as to where the money is coming 
from," county Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman said in response to Riordan's 
amendment. ". . . We are facing some terrible fiscal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 With Alatorre's active support, Riordan ultimately gained unanimous passage 
last August for his amendment. White said that day: "The Pasadena line was the 
single most difficult issue relating to adopting the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Riordan's amendment, Tetra Tech stood to gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The company in June, 1993, a month before Riordan took office, had received 
its $1.05-million contract to perform various engineering services on the 
Pasadena line. But records and interviews show that no payments would be made 
under the five-year contract unless the MTA made annual appropriations for the 
rail project. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan told The Times that his sponsorship of the budget amendment had 
nothing to do with Tetra Tech: 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a conflict on the (MTA) board. Some board members wanted to spend 
more money on the (Pasadena) line, others wanted to spend less than was 
proposed. And I was asked to put together a compromise. It just came down to 
that. . . . It was just simply a way of trying to bring consensus to the board. 
No deep-seated meaning to it or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he could not recall who asked him to put together the budget 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of Riordan's amendment last August quickly opened the funding spigot 
for the Pasadena line. Less than two months later, Tetra Tech received its 
first $267,000 in payments. As of this month, Tetra Tech had received a total 
of about $320,000, according to the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the $97 million of funding helped trigger the payments for Pasadena 
line engineering work, Harley Martin, an MTA environmental specialist who 
administers Tetra Tech's contract, said: "Sure it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Without that money, said Laurence Weldon, the MTA's vice president and chief 
manager for the Pasadena line, the final design and overall engineering 
services for the project would have ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody would have gone home," Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tetra Tech, its Pasadena line contract represents a new business 
opportunity in the local government arena. The company, which as of last year 
held contracts worth $45.8 million, relies most heavily on water cleanup 
projects overseen by the federal Department of Energy and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Tetra Tech began seeking the Pasadena line contract in 1992, 
when Riordan was still a member of the company's board of directors. Tetra Tech 
has received about $746,000 of payments on four other Metro Rail contracts, 
entered into in 1989 and 1991, during Riordan's four years on the company's 
board. He resigned in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who took office as mayor on July 1, 1993, said he had no knowledge of 
Tetra Tech's contractual role with the MTA when he took action to help save the 
Pasadena line. He also said he had not known of the company's earlier transit 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until (now), I did not know that Tetra Tech had any agreement whatsoever, or 
relationship whatsoever, with MTA," Riordan said in an interview last week. ". 
. . I didn't know they had any contracts. And I also did not know, therefore, 
that the budget in any way related to that." 
</P>
<P>
 The president of Tetra Tech said Riordan had no role in the company's pursuit 
of the Pasadena line contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said that because his holdings were placed in the blind trust, he "did 
not know, I still don't know, whether I owned any Tetra Tech stock at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 But financial disclosure statements Riordan signed upon assuming office last 
July and again two months ago listed his $9.75 million holding in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan referred more detailed questions about the trust to Jeffrey L. 
Glassman, an attorney at his former law firm. Glassman said that the mayor 
would have been informed of the sale of any portion of his stock held when the 
blind trust was created, but not the handling of new securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials seeking to avoid conflicts of interest can place assets under the 
control of a blind trust. But the value or sale of any investments that the 
official held before the formation of the trust must be publicly reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Political Reform Act requires public officials to abstain from 
governmental actions that can affect their personal investments of at least 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts contacted by The Times said that in Riordan's case, he should 
have abstained if it was "reasonably foreseeable" that the funding of the 
Pasadena line could benefit the company. By not abstaining, experts said, the 
mayor may have violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very legitimate for the press or possibly an investigative 
agency to raise this with Mayor Riordan," said UCLA law professor Daniel H. 
Lowenstein, who co-authored the state's conflict-of-interest law and served in 
the 1970s as the first chairman of the California Fair Political Practices 
Commission. "It's a very substantial investment on his part. His relationship 
to the company is a significant one." 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of policy, representatives of the Fair Political Practices 
Commission, which interprets and enforces the conflict-of-interest law, decline 
to discuss individual matters. The agency's spokeswoman, Jeanette Turvill, said 
that an official would risk violating the law by seeking and voting for funding 
for a project that stands to benefit a company in which he has invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said that a lawyer on his staff has advised him that his championing 
of the Pasadena line amendment did not pose a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and the lawyer, David Michaelson, both said that in their view the 
mayor's action did not violate the law because, although the amendment provided 
$97 million, it did not award a contract to Tetra Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor declined to answer whether he would seek a legal opinion from the 
Fair Political Practices Commission, advising him whether he should participate 
in future actions affecting Tetra Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Turvill said the law prohibits officials from participating in any government 
decision, including a budget amendment, that could "materially" affect a 
company they have invested in. The FPPC has ruled that for companies such as 
Tetra Tech, a "material" affect amounts to at least $150,000 within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The law states that an official should not participate in any decision "in 
which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial conflict of interest." 
The extent to which an official would be expected to foresee a conflict was 
described in an advice letter provided by the commission in another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a general rule," said the 1985 letter, "an official has 'reason to know' 
that a decision will affect a source of income whenever a reasonable person, 
under the same circumstances, would be likely to know the identity of the 
source of income and would be aware of the decision's probable impact on that 
source." 
</P>
<P>
 According to interviews and public records, including Securities and Exchange 
Commission filings, the mayor's relationship with Tetra Tech is extensive: 
</P>
<P>
 * Riordan owns $9.75 million of the company's stock, amounting to 7.4% of the 
total shares, second only to Tetra Tech's president. 
</P>
<P>
 * Riordan was a founding member of Tetra Tech's board of directors in 1988. 
Through one of his separate, venture capital firms, he and a partner purchased 
766,000 shares at $1.50 each. Riordan was still a director in 1991, when the 
company first offered its stock for sale to public investors. The stock price 
has soared with the company's expanded revenues, and closed Friday at $18.75 
per share. Tetra Tech's stock is traded publicly on the National Market System, 
known as Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 * Riordan, along with a co-general partner of one of his venture-capital 
firms, composed a majority of Tetra Tech's three-member board of directors from 
1988 to 1992. That partner, J. Christopher Lewis, remains on the board and is 
the trustee of Riordan's personal blind trust. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Riordan withdrew from Tetra Tech's board in December, 1992 -- as he 
prepared to run for mayor -- he was succeeded immediately as a director by 
Patrick C. Haden, another general partner from Riordan's venture capital firm. 
Haden, the former USC and professional football quarterback, continues to serve 
as counsel to Riordan's former law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * The law firm co-founded by Riordan, called Riordan & McKinzie, has served as 
general counsel to Tetra Tech since 1988. That year Riordan planned and helped 
carry out a leveraged buyout that enabled Tetra Tech's managers and Riordan to 
purchase the company from Honeywell Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Tetra Tech initially won the Pasadena line contract based on an evaluation of 
the company's capabilities and its pledge to allocate 35% of its work to 
minority subcontractors, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve D. Rhee, an MTA contracts administrator who oversees Tetra Tech's work, 
said the $1.05-million contract value was based on transit staff estimates, not 
on competitive bids. It is likely, Rhee said, that the contract would be 
expanded over the five years required to build the Pasadena line. 
</P>
<P>
 Tetra Tech's role includes identifying the environmental consequences of final 
design changes, such as relocations of proposed station sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In its most recent annual report, the company noted its 1993 contract with the 
MTA, and cited it as one of a handful of new business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we were pleased to win substantial new work in the commercial and 
state and local government sectors. . . . Work was also initiated on a 
five-year contract with the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
for environmental services related to Metro Rail construction," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private lawyer, investor and, finally, as mayor of Los Angeles, Riordan 
has over the years played a central role in shaping the future of Tetra Tech 
and commuter rail service to Pasadena: 
</P>
<P>
 It was Riordan who, as a lawyer, negotiated the public transit agency's 
purchase of the passenger line right-of-way from Santa Fe railroad during 1991 
and 1992. The transit agency paid Riordan & McKinzie about $900,000 for overall 
legal services during 1991-1993, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was Riordan, according to a securities analyst familiar with the 
matter, who advised the president of Tetra Tech in the late 1980s how to 
purchase control from Honeywell. Riordan also brought his law firm aboard as 
general counsel and, with Lewis, his business partner, controlled the board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of Tetra Tech, Li-San Hwang, contributed $1,000 to Riordan's 
mayoral campaign on Nov. 30, 1992, according to election records. Hwang said he 
made the contribution because he believes that Riordan's "action-oriented" 
approach to policy decisions and his business background are what Los Angeles 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has played no role with the Pasadena line contract, Hwang said. 
Although Riordan remained on Tetra Tech's board in 1992, "I don't think he ever 
knew we bid on that job," Hwang said. "He didn't really participate in those 
type of decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang said that he and others at the company thought the contract would be 
worth "another few million dollars by now. But apparently they (MTA officials) 
don't have the money for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Securities analyst David McDonald, whose underwriting firm, Wessels Arnold & 
Henderson, helped structure Tetra Tech's first public stock offering, said 
Riordan as a board member worked cooperatively with Hwang's management team. 
"It's a good relationship," McDonald said. "It's worked well for both parties. 
It's an extremely well-managed company." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said the 1993 MTA contract won by Tetra Tech "was nice . . . one of 
the new contracts they've gotten with local government." Overall, he noted, 
Tetra Tech's federal environmental services contracts are of the greatest 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last October, Tetra Tech had 607 employees and generated net income for 
the most recent year of $4.3 million, according to the company's financial 
statements. Chronicle of a Contract 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan last August saved the proposed Pasadena Line 
railway by winning approval for a budget amendment providing funding for the 
project. The funding activated an engineering-services contract held by Tetra 
Tech Inc. The mayor was the company's No. 2 shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Riordan reported his ownership of $9.75 million of Tetra Tech stock on this 
public disclosure form. The investment, as of the end of 1993, was Riordan's 
largest holding. 
</P>
<P>
 2) With this motion, Riordan won unanimous approval from the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority board to spend $97 million on the proposed 
Pasadena-to-Los Angeles railway project. 
</P>
<P>
 3) This ledger shows that seven weeks after Riordan won approval for the 
Pasadena Line, Tetra Tech received its first payments on a contract that had 
been inactive.

SHAPIRO NOW FACES HIS DEFINING MOMENT; COURTS: AFTER YEARS OF HELPING 
CELEBRITIES, THE DISCREET ATTORNEY LEADS SIMPSON DEFENSE TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN and TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some of the most emotionally gripping scenes in the rapidly unfolding 
drama of O.J. Simpson, the man at center stage has been Robert L. Shapiro, a 
discreet advocate who is known for deft damage control behind the scenes and in 
front of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dozens of journalists and cameras nine days ago, Shapiro said his 
client was suicidal and pleaded for him to return to face arrest. Last Monday, 
he comforted the subdued former football great as Simpson said he was not 
guilty of murdering his ex-wife and her friend. And, on Friday, the 
bushy-browed Shapiro won a victory when Superior Court Judge Cecil J. Mills 
decided that a tide of leaked information had tainted the grand jury that was 
considering murder indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to pull the jury off the case means that Simpson, who stands 
charged with murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, may have a 
chance to first hear the evidence against him at a public preliminary hearing 
scheduled for Thursday. Shapiro had hoped to avoid a grand jury indictment, 
which would have precluded a preliminary hearing where witnesses could be 
cross-examined. 
</P>
<P>
 With characteristic reserve, Shapiro did not gloat over what is being called a 
major setback for the prosecution, even though Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti 
supported the dismissal because of pretrial publicity. Shapiro merely said he 
looked "forward to finally presenting this evidence in a public courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory did much to at least temporarily dispel criticism that Shapiro, 
best known for getting celebrity clients out of relatively minor scrapes, was 
not up to the job of handling what is one of the most sensational murder cases 
of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a brilliant move," said Harland W. Braun, a former prosecutor who 
defended some of the officers accused of beating Rodney G. King. "The main 
thing is he's shaking them up on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in the trial are high for everyone involved. Simpson stands accused 
of crimes that could make him subject to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 For Garcetti, the case is a chance to end a string of embarrassing defeats for 
the district attorney's office, including hung juries in the Menendez brothers' 
first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the 51-year-old Shapiro, the son of a factory worker who later 
operated a catering truck and moonlighted as a bandleader, it may be the case 
that defines his place among the most famous attorneys in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has counted among his clients a few murderers, drug dealers and 
blue-chip corporations during his 25-year legal career, Shapiro has made his 
name by representing entertainers such as Johnny Carson and Rod Stewart, sports 
figures such as Darryl Strawberry and Vince Coleman, and other lawyers, 
including F. Lee Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of courtroom brilliance, his professional stock in trade has been his 
skill at negotiating plea bargains and winning sympathy for clients by shaping 
the public perception of their alleged misdeeds. And some lawyers, including 
New York attorney William Kunstler, have noted that Shapiro does not have an 
extensive record of arguing cases in court. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Simpson case, the ever-dapper Shapiro has appeared at each juncture 
to be unflappable, even serene, the antithesis of the confrontational lawyers 
often portrayed in movies and on television. Asked prickly questions by the 
media, he has opened his eyes wide and answered in detail without a hint of 
dismay. And inside and outside the courtroom, he has been the paragon of 
politeness, even when forcing the prosecution to admit it did not have a piece 
of widely reported evidence -- a bloody ski mask. 
</P>
<P>
 Being polite, sincere and low-key has served Shapiro well personally as well 
as professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity car valet Chuck Pick, a friend since childhood from the 
working-class Westside neighborhood where both grew up, attended a bar mitzvah 
for Shapiro's son recently at movie producer Robert Evans' house. Other guests 
included Garcetti, to whom Shapiro made a campaign donation of $5,000 last 
year, and such celebrity clients as Strawberry and Coleman and movie star Jack 
Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, Pick said, spent much of the party "hanging out with us guys that he 
grew up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Those characteristics also win points for Shapiro in the courtroom, said Alvin 
S. Michaelson, a criminal defense attorney who has worked with Shapiro on 
numerous cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, he said, Shapiro is able to be very nice and still get what he wants 
out of a system that is built on confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolute nonsense that he doesn't know how to try a case," Michaelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the pantheon of legal stars come down on opposite sides of the 
debate over Shapiro's readiness to take the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, godfather to Shapiro's first son, described him as the only lawyer in 
America allowed to use Bailey's name on a letterhead. "The bottom line is O.J. 
Simpson is in perfectly good hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who defended Albert DeSalvo in the Boston Strangler case and 
publishing heiress Patty Hearst, said Shapiro has been consulting with him on 
the Simpson case since the beginning and talked to him about Friday's motion to 
void the grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving open the possibility that he might be brought in to handle the 
courtroom phase of the case, Bailey said Shapiro has not made a decision. 
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended boxer Mike Tyson, also has 
been consulted about constitutional aspects of the case. Another member of the 
team is Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob is a team kind of guy and is quick to say that the best service to my 
client is to get all the best to help out," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 murder case involving Christian Brando, son of actor Marlon 
Brando, Shapiro took over from Kunstler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler said the younger Brando had a strong defense in the death of Dag 
Drollet, the lover of his half sister, Cheyenne, and that Shapiro should have 
taken the case to trial. Instead, Shapiro allowed Brando to plead guilty to 
manslaughter and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Shapiro later appealed 
the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take on a notorious fixer, a plea bargainer, like Shapiro gives the wrong 
message," Kunstler said. "He is entirely the wrong man for O.J. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also took heat in that case for allowing police to interview Cheyenne 
Brando about her lover's death. 
</P>
<P>
 She later left the country and turned up in Paris. Prosecutors suspected that 
Shapiro had, at least indirectly, advised her to flee to keep her from 
testifying against her half brother. Although witnesses were subpoenaed about 
that, it could never be proved and the matter was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brando case is one Shapiro cites in an article he wrote for a professional 
journal advising other lawyers how to handle themselves in high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Brando case, he wrote, he had to counter the likelihood that the 
prosecutor would try to make an example of his client because of his famous 
actor father. "To keep my options open, my first response to the media was a 
statement . . . that in all cases a lawyer has a responsibility and obligation 
to attempt to resolve cases without a trial." 
</P>
<P>
 That statement made it seem like it was common practice to resolve cases 
without going to trial, he said. It put pressure on the prosecution to settle 
"on terms that were acceptable to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Shapiro's name was associated with renown was in 1975, when he 
was still trading services for office space at a Sunset Boulevard firm headed 
by veteran defense attorney Harry Weiss. Brought in to help represent porn star 
Linda Lovelace in a Las Vegas drug case, he managed to get the case dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, he got calls from Bailey and Carson on the same day, asking him to 
represent them in drunk-driving cases. He was part of a team that called nearly 
30 witnesses and got Bailey acquitted in what was at the time the state's most 
celebrated such case. To avoid such a trial, Carson pleaded no contest in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Other clients have included Evans, whom Shapiro was able to keep from 
testifying in the spectacular Cotton Club case involving the 1983 murder of Roy 
Radin. Evans was not charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Shapiro took on New York Mets outfielder Coleman as a client after 
he was charged with throwing a powerful firecracker in the parking lot outside 
Dodger Stadium, injuring three people, including a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Larry Feldman, a longtime friend, said Shapiro's first public 
statement after taking the case showed his ability to shape perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said throwing the firecracker was "the stupidest thing anyone can do," 
said Feldman, who last fall represented the child who accused Michael Jackson 
of sexual molestation. "That defused the whole situation and then he went about 
building up who this person was and how sorry he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was given a one-year suspended 
jail sentence and three years probation. He was ordered to pay $1,000 and 
restitution to those who were injured. At Coleman's sentencing hearing last 
fall, during the Malibu fires, Shapiro told the judge that Coleman had his 
jeans and shovel in the car and was on his way to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 By that point in Shapiro's career, humanizing his clients to deflect attention 
from their misdeeds had become almost second nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Rangers baseball slugger Jose Canseco had started carrying a gun, 
Shapiro said when his client faced weapons charges, because he was scared and 
tormented by obscene telephone calls. Canseco pleaded no contest and received a 
six-month suspended jail term and 80 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Brando, in his murder trial, was portrayed as protecting his half 
sister from further beatings by her lover. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Simpson, Shapiro has talked about the football injuries that 
keep his client from sleeping unless he has a special pillow, and described him 
as lonely for his children on Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Shapiro defended Jerry Blackmon, who was neither famous nor rich. He 
had admitted shooting his estranged wife twice in the chest with a .357-caliber 
magnum revolver a year earlier while standing over her at the side of the 
Foothill Freeway in Pasadena. According to court records, witnesses testified 
that Blackmon said if he could not have his wife, no one else would. 
</P>
<P>
 Two psychiatrists hired as witnesses concluded that Blackmon was "so mentally 
impaired that he lacked the capacity to form 'malice' as the law defines it" 
and the charges in the case were reduced to manslaughter. Blackmon served five 
years and four months of an eight-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how Mr. Shapiro . . . orchestrates things," said Blackmon, who now 
lives outside Oklahoma City. "He was like Liberace playing the court system. If 
it weren't for him, I would have served 27 years to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Shapiro is handling a case with eerie parallels, one that will forever 
mark his career for good or for ill. And his transformation from hard-working 
celebrity attorney to the celebrity attorney of the hour is all happening 
within a few miles of the neighborhood where Shapiro grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born Sept. 2, 1942, in Plainfield, N.J., to a father who was working in 
a shirt factory and a mother who was employed as a department store clerk. He 
was 5 when he moved with his parents, an aunt and a grandfather to a four-unit 
apartment building at Pico and La Cienega boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Hamilton High School, Shapiro went to UCLA, where he 
earned a bachelor's degree in finance in 1965. Studies came easily for him and 
his fraternity brothers recall him spending as much time at parties at the Zeta 
Beta Tau fraternity -- called the campus "Animal House" by members -- as in the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years later, fraternity brothers still remember the dapper suits and 
big hair that earned him the nickname "Trini," after folk singer Trini Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to tease him about being flashy," said Jeffrey Allan Cohen, a Beverly 
Hills civil attorney and one of Shapiro's fraternity brothers, recalling in 
particular a powder blue polyester suit with "zero lapels." 
</P>
<P>
 They also remember his ability to negotiate settlements to frat house 
disputes. "He was always there to set matters right," said Richard Levin, 
another fraternity brother who is now an executive with major league baseball 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 At Loyola Law School, Shapiro struggled at first. He once told an interviewer 
that he failed his first class but that the shock was enough to make him study 
harder. Always a skillful communicator who was able to ad lib as if he was 
reading from a script, Shapiro won a moot court presentation before a U.S. 
District Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 While studying for the Bar, however, he became so nervous that he plucked out 
his eyebrows. Even so, he passed the test on his first try and began working as 
a deputy district attorney in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 He had married while in law school but the marriage fell apart a year later 
and was annulled in 1969. In 1972, he joined Weiss' high-volume practice, where 
the young attorneys worked late many nights on everything from drunk-driving to 
child molestation cases. It was during that time he married his second wife, 
Linell, and the couple later had two sons, whom Shapiro now coaches in soccer 
or Little League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shapiros live in a 3,600-square-foot, four-bedroom Cape Cod-style home in 
Benedict Canyon that they bought in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 victory in the Lovelace case "made me feel good," he told an 
interviewer several years ago, "but it also showed me the political pressures 
that come with publicity" and that it is "scary when somebody sticks a 
microphone in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shapiro has declined to give interviews in the wake of the Simpson 
case, he has held several impromptu news conferences attended by scores of 
reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 In dealing with the press, Shapiro advises his colleagues, avoid cliches when 
describing a homicide. Do not, for example, call it a "tragedy." Rather, use 
the term "horrible human event" or some other phrase that an attorney finds 
appropriate, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat such phrases continuously, he wrote, and "they will be repeated by the 
media. After a while, the repetition almost becomes a fact. That is the 
lawyer's ultimate goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The best initial response in a high-profile case, he wrote, was almost exactly 
what he employed in the Simpson case. He suggested telling reporters that "the 
best experts in the field are reconstructing the crime scene" and informing 
"the public that the client has support from his family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
 He did veer from his prescription when he told the media the day he replaced 
Howard Weitzman as Simpson's attorney that his new client had an alibi. If 
Shapiro later decides to argue that Simpson committed the crime but did so only 
under great mental stress, he will have to backtrack on the alibi statement, 
Kunstler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In describing Shapiro, attorneys familiar with his work as well as longtime 
friends return constantly to his personal qualities -- his skill at making 
people feel at ease and his confidence with such social graces as remembering 
birthdays, sending flowers and notes to old friends and looking directly in 
someone's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 They also talk about the importance he places on his personal commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, after appearing in court with his client and accompanying 
forensic experts to examine evidence, he ducked out to keep a promise to his 
children by taking them to a World Cup soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
 His sense of honor, his acquaintances say, prompted Shapiro to go to great 
lengths a week ago to explain how Simpson had disappeared despite the lawyer's 
assurances that he would be there when police came to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Davis, who defended Ray Buckey in the McMartin Pre-School case, said: 
"Bob Shapiro has immense interpersonal talent. He is one of the nicer guys in 
the Bar I know. Anyone who has ever talked to him knows he is very warm, very 
focused on people he is talking to, very sincere." 
</P>
<P>
 Those skills, Davis said, have "facilitated what he has accomplished for other 
celebrities who have had minor skirmishes with the law. But that is different 
from defending someone in a murder trial." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Shapiro says he is confident in a trial arena: "Let me tell you 
something about that. You cannot resolve cases or get favorable settlements 
until the prosecution knows you are capable of going to trial and winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are some who say Shapiro's reputation as a negotiator 
overshadows his substantial trial skills only by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Baron, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in Compton, said 
she met Shapiro in 1983 during a child molestation case. Shapiro represented a 
father who was trying to gain back the right to visit his daughters after they 
had been molested by a half brother in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, "I was persuaded that the father was an incredibly good father," 
said Baron, who was representing the daughters. "His cross-examination of 
witnesses was a marvel to behold. He does it calmly and quietly and he makes 
them look like idiots." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Friday's dismissal of the grand jury is further evidence of his 
skill. "I've never heard of such a thing being done, ever. It shows he has the 
ability to handle a big case like this and is not being overwhelmed by it."

COLUMN ONE; SMOKE, FIRE AND FUNDING; HAS THE STATE'S ANTI-SMOKING PROGRAM GONE 
TOO FAR? CRITICS DECRY USE OF PROPOSITION 99 MONEY FOR POLITICAL RESEARCH, 
LOBBYING AND BRASS-KNUCKLED ADS. BUT BACKERS CITE DRAMATIC GAINS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When voters decided in 1988 to slap an extra 25-cents-a-pack tax on 
cigarettes, they also launched an unprecedented experiment in persuading 
California smokers to kick the nicotine habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by the anti-smoking initiative, Proposition 99, the programs mix public 
persuasion, including a brass-knuckled ad campaign, with political action, 
promoting local laws to banish smoking from work sites and public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers say that no government anywhere in the world has attacked smoking 
with such vengeance -- or results. The programs are widely credited with 
helping reduce cigarette consumption in California by 27% in the last five 
years -- a faster drop than anywhere else in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state's assault on tobacco has raised hackles among smokers rights 
advocates and some politicians, who say the programs go far beyond the 
initiative's provisions and the voters' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments over Proposition 99 have heated up again because the law that 
details how the tax money should be spent is expiring Friday. Within the next 
few days, the Legislature and governor must decide whether to renew the 
programs as they are, expand the anti-smoking efforts as many health groups 
want, or redirect millions of dollars to health care programs for the poor that 
are threatened by the state's deepening budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever California decides will be watched closely around the country. As 
concerns about secondhand smoke have risen, several states have begun to 
imitate California's aggressive anti-smoking programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Proposition 99 cigarette tax has collected $3.1 billion over the last five 
years and the initiative broadly specifies how the money should be spent. To 
date, about two-thirds has gone for health services to the poor. At least 20% 
is designated for health education and 5% for research. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say too much of the money has gone to what they regard as 
government-paid lobbying to restrict the use of a legal product. Defenders say 
the growth of health care programs for the poor threatens to gobble up cash 
needed for the nation's most effective anti-smoking campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the debate is how the state Department of Health Services has 
used the $213 million doled out to communities and health groups for programs 
that encourage teen-agers to shun smoking and that promote local anti-smoking 
ordinances -- in effect, using tax money to generate political action. An 
additional $73 million has been spent on an often witty, sometimes vituperative 
media campaign that depicts tobacco industry executives as cynical purveyors of 
death for a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the table for examination is $136 million used for research, some of 
it to examine the tobacco industry's campaign contributions and lobbying 
activities. These few studies have been used to criticize politicians for 
caving in to tobacco interests. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that Proposition 99's aggressive programs exceed anything spelled 
out in 1988 by the initiative or by its backers -- a coalition of doctors, 
hospitals, nonprofit health agencies and environmental groups. In writing the 
initiative, these groups agreed that portions of the new cigarette tax would be 
divided among the various causes they supported. The doctors and hospitals 
wanted health care for the poor; the environmentalists wanted to expand 
wildlife habitats, and the nonprofit agencies wanted programs to reduce tobacco 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's language does not discuss advertising campaigns or the 
formation of advocacy groups to mobilize public support for smoking bans. It 
simply called for "programs for the prevention and reduction of tobacco use, 
primarily among children, through school and community health education 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The programs' champions say the media campaign and the political activity are 
exactly what voters wanted -- finding innovative ways to attack smoking -- and 
reflect a growing intolerance of a dangerous and addictive substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Proposition 99 tax in the name of public health, state tobacco 
control officials say they have set out not to outlaw tobacco, but to 
"de-normalize" its use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to put the tobacco industry out of business," said Colleen 
Stevens, who heads the state's media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens and other state officials cite statistics to show that their approach 
has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Per capita consumption in California has dropped at a rate almost three times 
faster than the rest of the nation since 1988, according to a state-funded 
study by UC San Diego professor John P. Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce and others suggest that the tax increase, the paid advertising and 
community programs have all helped to cut smoking, although it's unclear which 
programs are most effective. (One disappointing finding: overall smoking among 
teen-agers has remained fairly constant in California. But in the rest of the 
country, it is rising.) 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that health officials have overstepped their bounds by funding 
efforts to initiate local anti-smoking ordinances. Others argue that some 
expenditures have been just silly -- citing a scientific study of whether 
smoking causes facial wrinkling and subsidies for tobacco-free ski events for 
children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads that try to deglamorize smoking and alarm people about the dangers of 
secondhand smoke are especially irritating to smokers rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, the spicy mix of programs and in-your-face tactics has 
angered a lot of people -- not only smokers and tobacco executives but also 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 UC San Francisco professor Stanton Glantz, who has used a Proposition 99 
research grant to assess the impact of tobacco industry campaign contributions 
on legislators, has angered Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). In 
a series of reports, Glantz singled out Brown for taking almost $500,000 in 
contributions from tobacco interests since becoming Speaker in 1980 -- more 
than any other politician in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In an incident reported in Harper's magazine earlier this year, Brown was 
quoted as telling University of California executives: "If this guy gets one 
more cent of state money, you'll be in trouble with me!" 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Brown denied that he ever sought retaliation against 
Glantz, but he said that a study of campaign contributions was a misuse of 
Proposition 99 money intended to investigate tobacco-related disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The research done by these gentlemen (Glantz and his UC San Francisco 
colleagues) doesn't deserve to be classified as research," Brown said. "It's 
what we in politics do to each other when we're running for election." 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz's tobacco tax grant has expired and his proposal for a new one was 
turned down by a UC-appointed review committee. In an unsuccessful appeal of 
that decision, Glantz challenged the qualifications of the reviewers, one of 
whom questioned whether Glantz could ever show a direct causal link between 
campaign contributions and legislative tobacco policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz, who does not believe that politics played a role in the state 
decision, has won a National Cancer Institute grant to continue his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Merrell, who heads an organization called Californians for Smokers' 
Rights, argues that the state Department of Health Services-run program is 
illegally spending tax money to lobby local governments to pass ordinances that 
bar smoking in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Brother is stepping in and saying, 'No, you can't do it (smoke),' " said 
Merrell, a dedicated smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrell has sent legislators lists of state-funded anti-tobacco programs that 
sound frivolous or suggest that tax money is being used "by Department of 
Health, Tobacco Control Section, to build and operate a statewide political 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations by Merrell and others have won over supporters in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has proposed amending state law to 
bar the use of Proposition 99 tax money to promote "the passage of any smoking 
law or ordinance." The number of cities and counties with anti-smoking 
ordinances has almost doubled since the initiative's passage to nearly 300. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle also wants a truth in advertising standard applied to ads paid for out 
of the tobacco tax account. But a number of legislators have joined forces with 
health groups like the American Lung Assn. to defend the state programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), whose Campaign California organization 
helped pass Proposition 99, says the initiative has been an unmitigated 
success: "A million fewer people are smoking and on their way to preventable 
and premature death as a result of that proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden had high praise for a recent research report by UC San Francisco's 
Glantz, titled "The Twilight of Proposition 99." The study, like others that 
infuriate Speaker Brown, shows contributions to individual legislators and then 
grades them on their anti-tobacco stance. (Glantz asked "eight individuals 
knowledgeable about the Legislature and tobacco policy" to rate the legislators 
but will not reveal who they are.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen an analysis like that in a state-subsidized document," Hayden 
said. "They account for every penny of every (industry) campaign contribution 
and to whom. Unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-smoking groups agree with Glantz and Hayden that the state's most 
effective -- and controversial -- anti-smoking programs are in mortal peril. 
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights complains that education programs have been 
short-changed by almost $170 million, and the group has sued to return the 
money to programs that directly combat smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the alleged shortchanging, more than $300 million has gone to the 
state Department of Health Services' tobacco control efforts; $146 million has 
gone to the state's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz calls the department's tobacco control program "the most effective 
public health intervention since the invention of sewers." 
</P>
<P>
 With unabashed anti-tobacco fervor, a small cadre of public health workers 
oversees the state's war on tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the advertising campaign, the weaponry includes grants to 
nonprofit agencies and funding for the anti-smoking efforts of 61 local public 
health offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media program is the air cover, and we're the ground troops," said Carol 
Russell, who oversees local anti-tobacco programs for the state office. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional attempts to discourage smoking -- cessation classes that feature 
lectures on the destructive effect of tobacco on health -- have failed to do 
the job, Russell says. 
</P>
<P>
 So the state has turned to unorthodox attempts to fight tobacco -- often 
battling the tobacco companies on their own turf with advertising and 
sponsorship of glamorous events. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, there have been controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 The state office, for example, has been blasted for the skiing program it has 
funded at the Kirkwood Ski Resort in Alpine County. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly a $200,000 grant to the Bay Area Cancer Coalition was used in part 
to sponsor a Tobacco Free Challenge race car over three racing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going where the (tobacco) companies are and they hate us for it," 
Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally controversial has been the use of state money to form tobacco-fighting 
coalitions and to support local health departments in the push for local 
smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, the local health department last year plastered the city 
with signs saying "Support Smokefree Legislation. Call the Board of Supervisors 
Today." At the bottom of the sign, the printer added the words, "This sign will 
be removed by the committee after the election," a phrase added to political 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, the supervisors began to consider a citywide ban on smoking 
in the workplace, which was later enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials say there is a distinction between general advocacy of 
sound public health policy and the lobbying of legislators, supervisors or city 
council members on specific proposals. And in a February memo, the state 
tobacco control office told local health departments that the tax funds "are 
not and may not be used to support lobbying activities." 
</P>
<P>
 "Public health has always had a responsible role in policy development," 
Russell said. "We've seen it in the chlorination of water supplies and the 
vaccination of dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 And with projects like California Smoke-Free Cities, the state is providing 
technical assistance to local agencies that are considering anti-smoking 
ordinances. Today, partly as a result of the state effort, about 44% of 
Californians live in communities that restrict smoking in restaurants or 
workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hurting them," Russell said, "We're hurting these (tobacco) companies." 
</P>
<P>
 One result: California's anti-smoking programs are proving to be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Several states are considering higher tobacco taxes to launch their own 
programs. In 1992, Massachusetts approved an initiative similar to Proposition 
99. Candace Pierce-Lavin of the American Cancer Society says: "We saw that 
trying to tackle tobacco problems in traditional ways was not solving the 
problem, and we saw tremendous progress out there in reducing smoking rates." 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT: How should the Proposition 99 money be spent in the future? Proposition 
99 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 anti-tobacco initiative, Proposition 99, doubled the state tax on 
cigarettes, raising it by 25 cents a pack. The initiative required that the 
money be divided among several broad categories: 20% for health education, 5% 
for research, 5% for wildlife preservation, 45% for physician services and 
hospital care for the poor, and 25% in an unallocated account that can be used 
for any of the other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the $3.1 billion raised by the initiative has been used since the 
added tax went into effect on Jan. 1, 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 * Health education (tobacco control programs): $447 million (15%) 
</P>
<P>
 * Health education (maternal and child programs): $166 million (5%) 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco disease research: $148 million (5%) 
</P>
<P>
 * Wildlife preservation*: $213 million (7%) 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical care (hospitals, physicians and unallocated): $2.1 billion (68%) 
</P>
<P>
 *In 1990, voters approved Proposition 117, the wildlife protection initiative, 
which required that 2.5% of the Proposition 99 tobacco tax be taken from the 
unallocated fund and used for programs to protect mountain lions and other 
threatened species.

SIMPSON PROSECUTION READIES FOR HEARING; COURTS: HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIAL IN 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS ADDED TO THE CASE. GRAND JURORS TELL OF 
PROCEEDINGS.

 With less than a week to prepare, district attorney's officials hunkered down 
Saturday to sift through evidence and set their strategies for the preliminary 
hearing that suddenly has become necessary as they proceed with their 
prosecution of O.J. Simpson on charges that he murdered his ex-wife and her 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office also disclosed a change in the makeup of the 
prosecution team, with the naming of a high-level official, Central Operations 
Division Director William Hodgman, to serve as co-counsel with Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Marcia Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 An office spokeswoman said that Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn, who has 
appeared at court hearings with Clark, will be returning full time to the 
Menendez brothers murder case. Conn, head of the district attorney's special 
trials unit, serves as co-counsel in the Menendez case, in which a court motion 
is scheduled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conn was the one approached by police before the controversial release last 
week of 911 tapes of domestic violence reports against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure was not unexpected; district attorney's spokeswoman Suzanne 
Childs had said Monday that Conn would leave the case at some point. Childs 
emphasized that his leaving the prosecution lineup was not linked to the tapes 
flap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," Childs said. "It's almost a ludicrous question as far as I'm 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "David, as Marcia's supervisor, was assisting her. He was helping her prepare 
the case, but never with the intent he'd always be on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman, who joined the district attorney's office in 1978, has tried more 
than 40 murder cases and successfully prosecuted Charles H. Keating Jr., who 
became a national symbol of greed and excess in the thrift industry, on 
securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case was forced to a preliminary hearing after a judge Friday 
yanked it from the county's grand jury, saying he was fearful some of its 
members had been tainted by the unrelenting news coverage of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, dressed in jeans and a casual pink shirt with 
rolled-up sleeves, arrived at the Criminal Courthouse on Saturday morning to 
help prepare for the hearing, scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be ready," said the county's chief prosecutor, adding that his deputies 
were also at work at another undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors, under the speedy trial initiative, could conceivably 
offer a single witness, Garcetti suggested that they will go well beyond that, 
putting on a "skeleton" version of the full case that will be aired at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 One grand juror, in an interview with The Times on Saturday, spoke of being 
upset that the panel had not been allowed to decide whether to indict the 
retired football superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really disappointed," said the juror, whose mind had not yet been made 
up on how to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror said the grand jury had heard "almost all" of the witnesses to be 
presented by the district attorney, and that the group was poised to hear the 
prosecutor's summation and legal advice before proceeding to deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day the grand jury convened in the Simpson case, the juror said, 
the county coroner's office laid out pictures of the Brentwood crime scene 
where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were found stabbed to death 
nearly two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shocking," the juror said. "I couldn't even eat dinner that night. 
It's not because it was O.J. Simpson. It was just that the case was so bad. 
This crime was such a bloody mess." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror added that the public seems to be treating the victims in a surreal 
manner, as if they were characters in a movie who will come back to life after 
the lights come up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim is not O.J.," said the juror, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
"O.J. is not dead. There are two people dead. This is the problem with the 
emphasis of the newspapers. There are two people who died in a very gory way." 
</P>
<P>
 A second grand juror, also speaking anonymously, described the crime scene as 
"something out of antiquity." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was blood everywhere," the second juror said. "In today's age, you 
don't expect people to behave in such a violent way. Before, in antiquity, 
there was butchery. This was butchery. Absolute butchery." 
</P>
<P>
 The second juror added that "the grand jury could have done the job," but 
spoke of nonetheless supporting the decision by the supervising judge of the 
Los Angeles Superior Court, Cecil J. Mills, to recuse the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'm relieved that this case has become a public matter," the 
juror said. "This should be a public matter. It's such a major issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror acknowledged that panel members had received outside information 
about the case, including hearing the 911 tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be a liar if I said I didn't watch the news," the juror said. "I do know 
about the wild ride (referring to the low-speed police pursuit of Simpson's 
vehicle after he failed to turn himself in to authorities June 17). I don't 
think any grand juror did not hear about that." 
</P>
<P>
 The 911 tapes, the juror said, "were just one component of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Saturday, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams defended his 
department's release of the chilling tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consulted the city attorney. We consulted the district attorney's staff, 
and we were advised (to comply)," Williams told reporters after an appearance 
at a South-Central Los Angeles forum on public safety and community-based 
policing. "We did the right thing at the direction of senior officials in the 
city attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti has expressed surprise over the release of the tapes and said that 
LAPD officials did not mention the explosive audiotapes when informing Conn 
last week that they planned to release reports from past incidents involving 
O.J. and Nicole Simpson. Garcetti said Conn referred the police to the city 
attorney for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to City Atty. James Hahn's department said the office thought 
the LAPD had spoken with Garcetti's staff and determined that the tapes were 
not part of the murder investigation, and could thus be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the LAPD has been deluged with requests from local and national 
media outlets for tapes and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles police received 50 to 100 requests for tapes dating back to the 
'70s," he said. "Some people said, 'Give us anything and everything related to 
O.J. Simpson.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once released by the LAPD, the tapes were broadcast repeatedly in Los Angeles 
and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The first grand juror who spoke to The Times on Saturday said it was virtually 
impossible for anyone with a TV set not to hear the tapes. But the juror added 
that they would not have played a role in the jury's decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get the feeling that anyone was going to be thinking about the 911 
tapes when we deliberated," said the juror, who heard them after a ballgame on 
TV was interrupted for a special news broadcast. "It didn't matter. It didn't 
influence me." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror stressed that the grand jury members are a highly educated lot -- 
including engineers, teachers and four Ph.Ds, who could have set aside the 
publicity in their deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson had been indicted by the grand jury, there would have been no need 
for the preliminary hearing, a forum in which prosecutors must bare evidence 
and the defense can cross-examine witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense's demand for an immediate preliminary hearing is just one of the 
many unusual aspects of the extraordinary legal case. "Normally, the defense 
doesn't want a preliminary hearing so quickly because they want to develop 
questions for cross-examination," said Loyola Law School Prof. Stanley Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "All predictions are given with a grain of salt because I've never seen a case 
take so many twists and turns so quickly and there's no reason to believe it's 
going to stop here," said Goldman, a criminal law expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary hearings in murder cases can run anywhere from a single afternoon 
to many months. The all-time length record -- 18 months -- was set in the 
McMartin Pre-School case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, some legal experts predicted that the hearing may last 
only a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prosecutors will just put on a thin enough coating to get by the probable 
cause hurdle," said Southwestern University School of Law Prof. Robert Pugsley. 
"They want to keep a lot of cards up their sleeve." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may have been easier to win an indictment, experts say the 
upcoming hearing before Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay -- in which certain 
hearsay testimony can be admitted that could not be used at trial -- may not 
prove a picnic for Simpson either. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution "can spend a couple weeks dirtying up O.J. with their 
witnesses," Goldman said, "and probably not suffer too much of a hit because 
it's unlikely the defense will be calling any witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro has been assisted by a 
growing covey of star-studded co-counsels and investigators, including Harvard 
University law professor Alan Dershowitz, colorful veteran trial lawyer F. Lee 
Bailey and Santa Clara University Law School Dean Gerald Uelmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro did not return calls for comment Saturday. But a deputy at Men's 
Central Jail, who asked to remain anonymous, said that Simpson apparently spent 
his first peaceful night in custody since being incarcerated a week previously. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't up and down and thrashing around," said the deputy, who asked to 
remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Garcetti said his prosecution team will have more than enough time 
to prepare by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Andrea Ford, Dwayne Bray and William J. Eaton contributed 
to this story.

RUSSIANS LEAVE GERMANY MINUS FOND FAREWELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 How do you say "bum's rush" in German? 
</P>
<P>
 The approximate translation is a deplorable seven syllables long, but no 
matter. The expression has been vividly played out all around greater Berlin 
this spring and early summer, in the final act of the great piece of theater 
known as the end of the Cold War: Germany's back-of-the-hand farewell to the 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century ago, it was the Red Army that captured Berlin from its Nazi 
defenders, virtually single-handedly, at a cost of more than 300,000 Soviet 
lives. British and American troops counted for little in the final three weeks 
of fighting for Hitler's capital; the whole of the bloody street-to-street 
fighting fell to the Soviets. To this day, the bodies of 20,000 Soviet soldiers 
lie buried within the Berlin city limits, and tens of thousands more rest in 
525 Red Army cemeteries in the surrounding countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask a German today whether the fall of Berlin marked a defeat or a liberation 
for Germany, and he or she will almost certainly call it a liberation. Polls 
show again and again that Germans are glad their side lost the war, and that 
virtually no one would have wanted to live in Germany had Hitler's National 
Socialists prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 But you would never know the Germans were grateful to judge by the way they 
are showing the door to their erstwhile liberators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians kept 339,000 troops, along with 211,000 dependents and civilian 
support personnel, in East Germany during the Cold War. By comparison, the 
Western Allies committed token occupation forces to West Berlin: about 12,000 
Americans, British and French. Now that all of these occupation forces are 
going home, the French, Americans and British have been repeatedly feted with 
parades, fireworks, barbecues and assorted other merriments. 
</P>
<P>
 The French even saw fit to hand out baguettes and bottles of wine as their 
tanks rolled by in one parade earlier in the spring. And on June 18, they 
joined the Americans and British in marching in review down the Strasse des 
Siebzehnten Juni, one of Berlin's grandest and most historic thoroughfares, 
before an estimated 75,000 respectful Berliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, here are the Russians, holding their farewell party amid the 
weed-choked window boxes and cracked pavements of Wuensdorf, a tumbledown 
military base an hour's drive out of Berlin. Instead of appreciative thousands 
at the curbside, there were only fellow Russian dependents watching, and some 
curious German onlookers invited in from nearby villages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not good," says Dmitri Suchorukov, a Russian private who has come out 
for the festivities and is milling around the wurst stand with his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of our grandfathers died fighting Germany," adds Marina Jatchmeniova, a 
Red Army nurse who is queuing for a snack with a girlfriend. "My mother was 
born in 1944, and she never even saw her father. No one knows where he was 
buried." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the ceremonies for all the Allies should be together," says 
Suchorukov. 
</P>
<P>
 But it might have been even worse. Earlier this year, the German government 
had planned to give the Russians their send-off in Weimar, 150 miles southwest 
of Berlin -- a town that was, in fact, captured not by the Soviets but by 
American troops at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's top commander in Germany, Gen. Matvei Burlakov, rebelled at this 
historical snub in an angry news conference -- and a few days later, the 
Germans said the Russians could march in Berlin after all. But only in an 
outlying suburb. And not with the other Allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians held their parade Saturday in the eastern part of Berlin. "Live 
well Germany, homeland here we come," sang the 1,500 soldiers of the elite 6th 
Motorized Defense Brigade, based in Karlshorst. About 40 armored vehicles took 
part in the parade past about 30,000 Germans, a much smaller crowd than turned 
out for the Allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West is the winner, the East is the loser -- that is how everything is 
done in Germany," says Lothar Bisky, chairman of this country's Party of 
Democratic Socialism, the successor to the former East German Communist Party. 
"The Cold War never ends." 
</P>
<P>
 The humbling of the once-great Red Army doesn't stop at chintzy farewell 
parties and poorly attended parades in the middle of nowhere. All over what 
used to be East Germany, symbols of Russian valor and might are disappearing. 
Monuments have been taken down, streets are being renamed, and even the late 
Russian general who governed Berlin for a few months after V-E Day has been 
posthumously stripped of his honorary citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the revisionist goings-on at the Museum to the Unconditional 
Surrender, a Berlin institution dedicated to the Red Army victory over fascism. 
It has been housed since 1966 in the building where the formal instruments of 
surrender were signed by German and Allied officers in the spring of 1945, and 
which was subsequently used as a kind of martial-law city hall by East Berlin's 
early Soviet overlords. 
</P>
<P>
 For 28 years, the Museum of the Unconditional Surrender has been an unabashed 
shrine to Red Army valor. Fourteen rooms have been filled with busts of Russian 
officers, photographs of Russian troops and combat maps bearing Cyrillic 
legends. The workroom of Marshal Georgi Zhukov, the Soviet commander who led 
the assault on Berlin, has been left untouched; his uniform, now a bit faded, 
still hangs in a glass case. By the front entrance stands a Russian tank, with 
the inscription, "For my homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, with fewer than 7,000 Russian troops left in Germany and those 
scheduled to be gone by Aug. 31, the museum has been closed for a complete 
overhaul. Inside, a team of German historians and their assistants has been 
taking apart the exhibits and packing the pieces off to a warehouse. When the 
museum reopens under German management next year, the entire concept will be 
different. Instead of Red Army heroism in 1945, it will showcase German-Russian 
relations over 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old exhibit focused mainly on the war," confirms Viktor Gorynia of the 
German Historical Museum, who is overseeing the renovations. "Now, we want to 
cover the whole period from 1917 to the 1990s." Instead of telling the story of 
the Russian ground-pounder, the place will present both Russian and German 
points of view, and document the sufferings of soldiers and civilians of each 
belligerent, he says. There will even be a room given over to the three other 
Allied nations. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this goes down poorly with some of the young, white-gloved aides who 
are dismantling the Russian exhibit under Gorynia's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm packing these items away, and they'll go into storage, and then they will 
never come back," complains Stephan Boehmer, who is wrapping historic 
black-and-white photos in tissue paper and packing them into cardboard boxes. 
He reaches into a box and pulls out a photo of a German bone-grinding machine 
-- a piece of concentration-camp hardware designed by Nazi authorities to turn 
the evidence of mass murder into fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This picture will never come back" when the museum reopens, says Boehmer. "In 
a certain sense, I think you could say we are rewriting history. But I believe 
that a monument is a monument, representing a certain time in history. This 
museum should stay as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Few Germans -- particularly Germans in what used to be the West -- would share 
Boehmer's sympathy for the Russians' current plight. Having watched their 
Western keepers prevail in the long-fought ideological contest with Moscow, 
Germans are in general reluctant to cling to the least reminder that the 
Soviets won the military struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 No one here can forget that it was the Soviets, after all, who followed up 
their 1945 liberation with the 1948 blockade of Berlin. Or that it was the 
Soviets, in the summer of 1953, who sent tanks into Berlin to brutally put down 
an East German construction workers' uprising. Or that it was the Soviets who 
approved construction of the Berlin Wall, and who, in general, served as the 
puppeteers behind the East German regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The five years since the fall of the Berlin Wall do not cancel out the 45 
years that went before," says Joachim Thies, foreign editor of the newspaper 
Die Welt, and a conservative authority on international affairs. "The Russians 
were oppressors. As individuals, they are poor people, and they must certainly 
feel very miserable now. But for me, they are still the representatives of the 
oppressors, and they will be until the last moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the brutality of Russian domination stirring in the German mind 
has also been the shock here over the condition of the Russian bases in what 
used to be East Germany. After the pullout began, incoming Germans found a 
running series of pocket disasters on the lands managed by the Red Army: 
unexploded ordnance scattered about, drums of hazardous chemicals tilting in 
stream beds, rusted-out vehicles left in the woods and meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the barracks and dependents' housing was filthy, and in some cases the 
departing troops had ripped out faucets and other fixtures to take back to 
Russia with them. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Germans, this is but another reinforcement of their long-held 
stereotype about the Russians: that they are scarcely more than barbarians, an 
army that raped its way westward in 1945 and never reformed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians committed atrocities even in the countries that did not attack 
them," says Thies. "I would hate to whitewash this difficult relationship. We 
Germans were, with good reason, excluded from the (D-day commemoration 
ceremonies on) Omaha Beach, and the Russians were, with good reason, excluded 
from the Allied joint ceremonies in Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
 However unwilling mainstream Germans may have been to come witness them, the 
Russian farewell activities in Wuensdorf were, in fact, stirring and well 
orchestrated. The ground rumbled as Warsaw Pact tanks and armored personnel 
carriers went rolling down Wuensdorf's narrow asphalt lanes. Helicopters with 
large red stars on their undercarriages flashed by overhead at treetop level. 
</P>
<P>
 On the reviewing stand, Gen. Burlakov wept openly into his handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian military leadership has helped us make our way to the new 
Germany," the governor of the state of Brandenburg, Manfred Stolpe, said in his 
goodby speech. "Keep us in your memory. We have been friends, and we will stay 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was going too far," Joachim Thies said of Stolpe's remarks in an 
interview afterward. "You can't say, 'Now we have lost friends!' I am a bit 
ashamed of this country. How can one so mix up liberators and oppressors?"

FIGHT FOR GAY RIGHTS STARTED EARLY IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "One flower hits me," snapped the policeman, "and you're going to be charged 
with assault on a police officer." It was 3 a.m. on an August night in 1968. In 
the lobby of the Harbor Division police station stood two dozen men, 
flourishing sprays of gladioli, daisies and roses. 
</P>
<P>
 They were there in protest, gathered in a singularly '60s marriage of flower 
power and gay camp. Hours earlier, Los Angeles police had swept into the Patch, 
a popular gay club in Wilmington, and hauled away two customers on morals 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with police raids, Patch co-owner and manager Lee Glaze exhorted the 
bar crowd not to be intimidated. Armed with flowers from a customer's shop, he 
then led a band of patrons to the police station, where they milled around the 
lobby with their wilting bouquets until the arrestees were released on bail at 
the approach of dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year later in New York City, there would be another protest -- this 
time big, ugly and violent -- against a police raid on a crummy Greenwich 
Village gay bar called the Stonewall Inn. Scores were injured as they fought 
with police, returning to the streets again and again over a period of five 
days. In the annals of modern American gay history, the Stonewall riots of June 
28, 1969, are known as the torch that lit the gay rights movement, that fired 
the previously quiescent gay masses into organized action and resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 But like any movement's defining moment, Stonewall could not have happened 
without many mini-moments in the years before. As Stonewall's 25th anniversary 
is observed in New York this weekend with celebrations and a huge gay rights 
demonstration in Manhattan, some of the sturdiest roots of that rebellion can 
be traced across the country to California and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it the 1951 formation of the Mattachine Society -- the first lasting gay 
political organization in the nation, the 1953 publication of One -- the first 
widely circulated, explicitly gay magazine in the country, or the petal protest 
at the Harbor station, the seeds of revolution were being sown in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Glaze did not look at it quite that way. He was just mad. "Hey, 
enough, enough," he remembers thinking. Not only were the cops once again 
harassing his customers, but the arrests were particularly outlandish. The two 
men accused of lewdly groping one another were both interested in the same man 
-- but they were not interested in each other and certainly had not shared any 
intimacies. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could you possibly arrest two queens who hated each other?" Glaze, 59, 
still wonders. He is sitting in his art-stuffed Long Beach apartment, flipping 
through the pages of a scrapbook fat with snapshots of bell-bottomed and 
occasionally bewigged friends -- many of whom have died of AIDS. "All of these 
kids," he sighs, gazing back into a world now gone. 
</P>
<P>
 He turns more pages, settling on black-and-white blowups taken of the police 
station visit by an off-duty news photographer, a Patch regular. The photos 
document more camp than rage. The camera freezes the young men, grinning in 
their Nehru shirts under the police station sign. Glaze vamps by the front 
desk, clutching a lavishly ribboned bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for the time, it was an act of uncommon defiance, duly noted in the infant 
Los Angeles Advocate, which later evolved into one of the country's leading gay 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the arrests and Glaze's speech to his customers -- "All we want is 
to be left alone in our own bars" -- the Advocate reporter wrote expectantly: 
"If the reaction of the customers there that night is any indication, a new era 
of determined resistance may be dawning for L.A.'s gay community." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Patch protest had a ripple effect, according to gay archivist and 
veteran activist Jim Kepner. In the following months several gay organizations 
were founded: a legal aid group, a theater and film club and the Metropolitan 
Community Church, which now boasts of congregations worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 To belong to such groups was still daring. It was an era when Los Angeles 
police were arresting thousands of homosexuals a year on morals charges. 
California, along with virtually every other state, had sodomy laws 
criminalizing gay sex. In gay clubs, simply dancing together or touching could 
bring the vice cops running. 
</P>
<P>
 To be gay was, in effect, illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bar raids were routine and sometimes brutal. "People were hauled out and 
thrown down on the sidewalk," said Kepner, remembering a place called the Red 
Raven. Charges were often trumped up. No sooner had one man gotten in the door, 
Kepner recalled, than he was arrested for performing sex acts in the middle of 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, when gays joined a number of minority communities protesting police 
brutality in Los Angeles, the organizers forbade them to utter the words gay or 
homosexual.  
</P>
<P>
 And so when Kepner addressed a rally of about 200 demonstrators outside a 
Silver Lake gay bar called the Black Cat, he told the crowd: "We won't say who 
we are tonight, but look around. . . . We promise that after tonight, the 'love 
that dared not speak its name' will never be quiet!" 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1960s, Kepner was already a seasoned gay activist. He had joined 
the Mattachine Society in 1953, when the very concept of organizing for what 
was then known as the "homophile" cause was radical, even dangerous. Later he 
edited One, which had to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn an order 
blocking the magazine's distribution by the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, decades before gay studies programs made their way into college 
curricula, Kepner was teaching a few gay studies classes at One's Downtown 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after years of such stirrings, however, the climate remained icy. Life 
magazine, writing in 1964 about the "sad and often sordid world" of 
homosexuals, alluded to the running battle between Los Angeles police and gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "As part of its anti-homosexual drive," the article stated, "the Los Angeles 
police force has compiled an 'educational' pamphlet . . . entitled 'Some 
Characteristics of the Homosexual.' The strongly opinionated pamphlet includes 
the warning that what homosexuals really want is a 'fruit world.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Against such a backdrop, most gay men and lesbians lived in a shadow world 
governed by the tenets still embodied in today's policies on gays in the 
military: Don't ask. Don't tell. And if you do, you could lose everything. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Glaze's customers -- a schoolteacher arrested outside of the Patch 
sometime before the August raid -- was so distraught at being exposed that he 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Twentyman, a Northridge financial adviser, recalled: "In 1969, I was in 
the closet. My lover was in the closet. All my friends were in the closet. That 
was life. . . . It seemed perfectly normal to me. I couldn't imagine living any 
other way." 
</P>
<P>
 So tightly was the closet door shut, that Twentyman says many of her 
contemporaries remain behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homophobia is very deeply ingrained in our era," the 54-year-old said. "It's 
kind of like going through the Depression or the Holocaust. All those events 
shape people in a certain way. That's the reality you lived and it's real 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 When Chuck Murphy, 56, and Al Barney, 66, bought a house together in Manhattan 
Beach in 1963, an insurance agent said he could not possibly sell a homeowner's 
policy to two men. For their housewarming party, the couple carefully arranged 
the bedrooms to make it appear that they slept apart -- and explained the house 
purchase as a business deal entered into solely for tax breaks. If they went to 
gay bars -- usually sign-less and windowless -- they carefully scanned the 
street to see if anyone was watching before ducking inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The two heard of the Stonewall riots in New York, but at the time, did not 
attach much significance to them. If anything, Murphy said, he disapproved of 
the bottle- and brick-tossing clash with police. "I don't think violence is 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he feels comfortable enough to display gay pride symbols in his car 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonewall was not even a blip on Bonnie Wilkerson's radar screen. She 
remembers the 1950s and '60s as "the pits" for gay people. "You couldn't tell 
anybody. If you did, you were really ostracized." 
</P>
<P>
 One dared not utter the word lesbian . "It was always a taboo word," said 
Wilkerson, 78, who lives in Huntington Beach. "In fact, it took me quite a 
while to say it." 
</P>
<P>
 She was an architect working in Orange County in what she calls "a man's 
world" and was closeted her entire career. If she saw any glimmers of the gay 
revolution, she did not run to the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt powerless. I'm not one to stir up the pot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the scent of change was intoxicating. 
</P>
<P>
 When Myra Riddell heard about the Greenwich Village insurgency from New York 
friends, she knew it would have an effect. "I thought it was just great, that 
it was going to be the start of something," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time she left her marriage in the mid-1950s and ran off to Europe 
with another woman, she had been open about her homosexuality. "I told 
everybody. . . . I thought it was just wonderful and the result was a big 
flap," said Riddell, 67, who lives in the Hollywood Hills and is president of 
the Los Angeles County Commission for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Flap or no, she remained open. "I don't know, I guess I've always been a 
rebel," she said. Within a couple of years of the Stonewall riots, she was 
working in the gay movement. In 1975, she helped found Southern California 
Women for Understanding -- carefully named to avoid any gay overtones, but a 
lesbian group nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Stonewall, Kepner noted, many gays sought validation from the 
authorities. "After Stonewall we gave the authorities the finger for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1969, a small group picketed the Los Angeles Times, protesting the 
newspaper's refusal to print advertisements for the Homosexual Information 
Center of West Hollywood. (A Times official said the ads failed to meet the 
paper's "standards of acceptability.") 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, a Los Angeles branch of the new Gay Liberation Front was born. 
In June, 1970, activists went to court to help clear the way for a "gay power" 
parade down Hollywood Boulevard to commemorate the first Stonewall anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 demonstrators marched to catcalls and cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay pride had arrived.

CLINTON DIGS IN HEELS ON HEALTH BILL; LEGISLATION: PRESIDENT DECRIES 
'HALFHEARTED MEASURES' ON REFORM, CALLS FOR SAME 'GREAT DEAL' FEDERAL WORKERS 
GET. HOUSE PANEL HOLDS CONTENTIOUS SATURDAY SESSION AS DEMOCRATS REPEL GOP 
PROPOSALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurning talk of compromise, President Clinton said Saturday he hoped to 
provide all working Americans with the same "great deal" on health insurance 
that he shares with members of Congress and other federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly radio address, the President stood firmly behind his renewed 
call for universal coverage and denounced what he called "halfhearted measures" 
that would fall short of ensuring medical insurance protection for all 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton clearly was referring to a new proposal backed by moderate Republicans 
and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee. The plan unveiled Friday fails 
to meet the President's bottom-line demand on coverage. Its fate in the 
committee is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-discussed compromise would require neither employers nor individuals 
to buy health insurance but would rely on market reforms, tax breaks and 
vouchers for the poor to achieve coverage for 95% of Americans by the year 
2002. If that level were not obtained, a national commission would make 
recommendations to Congress on how to do better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half measures, quick fixes, things that sound better than they actually will 
work will only make matters worse," the President said. "Make no mistake, 
measures that are halfhearted would, at best, guarantee that things stay only 
about as good as they are now -- the poor would get health care, the wealthy 
would get health care and the middle class would get it sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to help middle-class Americans -- whose economic success is the key 
to America's prosperity -- know that they will always have health security, 
even if they have to change jobs or if they lose their jobs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's remarks came as the House Ways and Means Committee held an 
unusual Saturday session, punctuated by fierce partisan outbursts, in an 
attempt to finish work on its modified version of Clinton's plan before 
Congress leaves on its July 4 break. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting largely along party lines, the panel defeated a series of Republican 
attempts to modify the bill. It voted against a GOP proposal to kill a planned 
Medicare program for the poor and employees of small firms. It also rejected a 
Republican call to scrap proposed restraints on the growth of Medicare 
spending, pushed by the Democrats as a way to control costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an organized effort by the Republicans to scare the people to death 
about this program," said Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), acting chairman of the 
panel, as he led the fight to fend off GOP amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), author of the proposal to forgo restraints 
on Medicare outlays, said it was unlikely the anticipated savings would be 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like legislating with a magic wand," Shaw protested. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) contended that Medicare spending would 
explode from the current $163 billion a year to $460 billion in 2004 without 
the provisions to hold down outlays to $391 billion at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw also proposed to make drug care under Medicare an optional plan rather 
than mandatory, as proposed in the bill before the committee. He lost on a 
voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward) countered: "To make this program voluntary is 
to destroy it. . . . Do not penalize the seniors by raising the cost of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 After six hours of uninterrupted work, Gibbons said "substantial progress" had 
been achieved. But he said the controversial topic of cost containment would be 
on the agenda when the panel resumed its sessions Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other committees -- the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the 
House Education and Labor Committee -- have approved health care bills along 
the lines that Clinton seeks. Along with the Ways and Means Committee, the 
Senate Finance Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee are 
expected to produce versions of health care legislation before a bill is 
brought to the floor of either chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that 15% of the U.S. population lacks health insurance, the President 
said that even those who are now covered cannot be sure they will be protected 
against medical costs in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, not all Americans face this kind of risk," Clinton added in a 
message apparently aimed at the lawmakers who are considering health care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of Congress, along with the President and all federal government 
employees -- we have a great deal right now," he said. "We work for you, the 
taxpayers of America. And you reward us with health coverage that can't be 
taken away, even if we get sick. Not only that, we have the requirement that 
employers contribute most of the cost of our health plan -- that's you, you're 
our employers -- and we contribute some. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I believe every working American deserves these same benefits and that 
same guarantee," Clinton said, appealing to his listeners to tell members of 
Congress that they share his belief. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Clinton's plan -- requiring employers to pay 80% of health care 
costs -- was assailed by Rep. H. James Saxton (R-N.J.) as a job-killing, 
wage-cutting provision that is unacceptable to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. President, it's not that the American people are unwilling or unable to 
understand your plan," Saxton said in a Republican response to Clinton's radio 
talk. "It is that the American people have rejected your big-government, 
high-tax approach." 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP spokesman argued that Congress should pass more limited legislation to 
bar denial of health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, to reform 
medical malpractice laws and allow smaller firms to pool risks that would lower 
their insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such common-sense reforms are not halfhearted, nor are they hardheaded," 
Saxton said. "Unfortunately, Congress can't pass a meaningful health care 
reform bill until President Clinton abandons his 'my way or the highway' 
position on a government-run bill which would raise our taxes, limit our 
choices and kill our jobs."

IOWA GOP GEARS UP FOR '96 WITH PRESIDENTIAL POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Iowa Republican Party's 1996 presidential straw poll was something like a 
risque bachelor's party: Everybody acted a little embarrassed to be there but 
deep down they were having a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would admit to taking seriously a sounding of presidential preference 
20 months before the 1996 nomination process begins with Iowa's precinct 
caucuses. But the nearly 2,000 GOP partisans who packed a downtown convention 
center Friday night sounded eager for the opening bell as they whooped and 
cheered through speeches by seven prominent Republicans and then declared their 
choices from a list of 23 possible 1996 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a hurry for 1996 to come," said Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who seemed as 
impatient as a 5-year-old on Christmas Eve, "because we're in a hurry for Bill 
Clinton to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates cast the most ballots for absent Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
of Kansas, whose political lieutenants had carefully marshaled support for him. 
Dole carried slightly more than 26% of the vote. But some in the hall 
immediately questioned whether his showing was strong enough; he won the last 
Republican caucus here in 1988 with 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Dole, with 15.2%, came Lamar Alexander, a former education secretary 
and Tennessee governor who already has begun building an organizational base in 
his state. In his speech, Alexander offered the evening's catchiest slogan: 
"Cut their pay and send them home." That was the distillation of his call to 
reduce Congress to a part-time citizen legislature that would serve only from 
January until "the time baseball season starts" in April, and then again from 
Labor Day until Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Close behind Alexander came Gramm, who polled just under 15% and immediately 
demonstrated that he has been practicing something indispensable to any 
presidential candidate: explaining why he was the real winner even though he 
hadn't collected the most votes. The answer: He polled more than half as many 
votes as Dole. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first of many battles in a long war," Gramm said after the tally. 
"But we won this battle." 
</P>
<P>
 After Gramm came former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp with 
almost 12%; Kemp made no speeches but still had the services of a campaign 
organization left over from 1988, when he ran fourth in the state caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who addressed the gathering, and former 
Vice President Dan Quayle, who did not, were next in single digits, followed by 
Patrick J. Buchanan, who gave a rousing address, and former Education Secretary 
William J. Bennett, who did not attend but was bolstered by support from 
religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Three moderates who spoke -- former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, 
Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, and former Labor Secretary Lynn Martin -- each 
polled less than 2%. About 1% expressed interest in former Joint Chiefs of 
Staff Chairman Colin L. Powell -- who has not publicly expressed any interest 
in the race, much less declared himself a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Even allowing for the fact that the real Iowa vote was still 597 days away, 
the results may not have been a truly representative sample of local Republican 
opinion -- only people who bought $25 tickets could cast a ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost gave those eager to post a good showing -- like Dole, Alexander and 
Gramm -- an incentive to lean on their contacts to buy tickets, which benefited 
the state party. It was a swift reminder to the potential GOP class of 1996 
that in Iowa they treat presidential politics as a cash crop -- one that is 
harvested aggressively every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called up the party chairman and said: 'What is it with this blackmail 
dinner?' " said Dick Redman, a Des Moines developer and friend of Alexander. 
"And the chairman said: 'Blackmail, hell, it's extortion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The seven speeches given throughout the evening offered a snapshot of the 
consensus GOP case against President Clinton -- and a panoramic glimpse at the 
ideological range of options the party is likely to face two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers piled on Clinton for promoting "socialized medicine," weakening 
U.S. foreign policy (particularly by deferring too much power to the United 
Nations) and generally failing to deliver the moderate "new Democrat" agenda he 
promised in 1992. Cheney declared the Clinton Administration "perhaps the least 
competent . . . we've had in this century in terms of its conduct of foreign 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 More biting were the differences among the speakers about the GOP's direction 
-- particularly its course on social issues like abortion and homosexual 
rights. Almost all of them took pains to defend the political involvement of 
religious conservatives -- whose influence in the GOP has come under 
intensifying criticism from Democratic leaders in the past few weeks. Most 
enthusiastic about defending the religious conservatives were the most 
conservative speakers, Gramm and Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the Christians who are going to be fed to the lions in November," 
said Buchanan in the evening's most vigorous and sharpened speech. "It's the 
Democratic Party." 
</P>
<P>
 While defending the religious right's involvement, the representatives from 
the party's moderate wing also cautioned them. Both Kean (who, alone among the 
speakers, stated flatly he was not considering a run for the presidency) and 
Specter (who appeared to be examining his options) said the GOP must embrace a 
"politics of inclusion" and reject extremist positions on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Specter won surprisingly enthusiastic applause when he admonished religious 
conservatives for demanding party purity on issues like opposition to abortion 
and declared "the power to divide is the power to destroy." He also attracted 
the evening's one round of catcalls when he affirmed his support for "the basic 
American principle of separation of church and state" -- which some apparently 
took as a call for Christian activists to lower their political profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious conservatives affiliated with the Christian Coalition, a political 
organization founded by Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, constituted about 
25% of those who cast ballots Friday night, and about 40% of the overall 
delegates to this weekend's state party convention, estimated Ralph Reed, the 
group's national executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers gave the baby-faced Reed a quietly confident swagger as he 
bustled through the hall. "We're adopting a Maoist strategy," Reed said, 
explaining the group's attitude so far toward the 1996 field, "let a thousand 
flowers bloom." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the evening demonstrated how eager Iowans are to regain their place 
at the head of the line in presidential politics. Four years ago, the Democrats 
ceded the state to Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin and did not mount serious campaigns 
here. But while conceding that Dole opens with a large advantage if he runs, 
likely candidates such as Gramm and Alexander already appear to be eyeing the 
kind of second-place Iowa finish that propelled Democrat Gary Hart to 
prominence in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowans shouldn't have to wait too long for the candidates to return. Asked how 
soon he expected Republicans to begin announcing their candidacies, Gramm 
flipped through a mental calendar and fired back: "Jan. 2." He meant Jan. 2, 
1995.

UNITED WAY CUTS GRANTS TO VALLEY AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concluding a wrenching debate over how to share its diminishing resources, 
United Way's Valley leadership has severely trimmed its annual grants to dozens 
of familiar social-service agencies to free up funds for new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a fourth consecutive year of declining contributions, United Way 
officials said they crafted the new allocation policy to give the highest 
priority to preventive programs, particularly those aimed at children and AIDS, 
at the expense of those that treat existing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the United Way's North Angeles Region notified its 64 affiliates in 
writing of the cuts, which average 20% or a total of $582,000. Contributions to 
a handful of longtime recipients were reduced to a pittance, leading at least 
one agency to sever a longstanding tie to United Way and two more to consider 
eliminating their Valley operations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 10 agencies will receive United Way funding for the first 
time and two current affiliates will gain sizable new grants. Among the new 
agencies are the Northeast Valley Health Corp., AIDS Project Los Angeles and 
the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. The money will 
sponsor short-term child care for children of HIV-positive parents during 
medical appointments and expanded AIDS outreach and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the agencies most hurt sharply criticized the funding shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned that United Way has lost its focus," said a letter from the 
board of the Pacific Lodge Boys Home of Woodland Hills, which Friday notified 
United Way that it has refused the $5,000 offered and severed its relationship 
with the charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad moment," said David Genders, executive director of Pacific Lodge, 
which operates a residential program for abused or delinquent boys. "You're 
talking to somebody who's championed United Way for 20-some years." 
</P>
<P>
 Departing from its customary practice of dividing all its resources among a 
"family" of agencies that cover the spectrum of social services, the board of 
United Way's North Angeles Region is moving toward a strategy of targeting the 
most urgent community needs. 
</P>
<P>
 United Way officials said the new policy reflects the painful choices that 
must be made in a time of worsening social problems and diminished 
philanthropic resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way is it saying that what some of the agencies are doing is not good 
or is not needed," said Dorothy Fleisher, director of planning and agency 
relations for the North Angeles Region. "It's just saying we can't invest in 
everything, so we are going to have to be more selective." 
</P>
<P>
 The severity of some of the cuts raised eyebrows when the plan went before the 
parent agency in Downtown Los Angeles earlier this month. Though conditionally 
approving the plan, the executive committee of the United Way of Greater Los 
Angeles kicked it back to the Valley leaders for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown leaders asked the Valley board to do everything possible to 
lessen the impact of the cuts and ensure that the agencies had adequate warning 
of the impending losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was simply to review their process to see if there was any way the 
severity could be mitigated," said Patricia Murar, senior vice president for 
administration, downplaying the significance of the unusual parliamentary 
maneuver. Valley leaders said they agree that they must work closely with the 
affected agencies to lessen the damage, but they cannot restore any of the 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree it would be better if we could give the agencies more time to deal 
with such Draconian cuts," said North Angeles board member Kay Inaba, who also 
sits on the Greater Los Angeles board. "That's not an option that's 
economically viable for us. I wish we had some reserves, but we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The giant philanthropy, which solicits donations in the workplace, is in its 
fourth year of a fund-raising slide that has cut annual receipts in Los Angeles 
to barely half 1990's high mark of $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite hopes for an upturn, the 1994 campaign is now expected to close out at 
the end of this month at about $58 million, $3 million less than last year's 
campaign raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing the weak fund-raising as a long-term condition, the Greater Los 
Angeles board asked its five regional administrations to reassess their 
communities' needs to make the greatest use of shrinking funds. The North 
Angeles Region used the process to make more sweeping changes than any other 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, leaders decided to take 20% away from the annual grants to the 
64 affiliates -- totaling $2.9 million -- to stimulate new programs in the 
areas it assigned the highest priority: preventive services for families, 
preschool children and people with HIV/AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 A few existing programs which had programs in those areas were given modest 
increases in their annual grants. The 31st District Parent Teacher Student 
Assn. got an increase in its current grant plus a new grant for its dental care 
program for schoolchildren, and the Visiting Nurse Assn. received a donation 
for its visits to AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers in the process include charities that receive support from other 
United Way regions. One example is Family Service of Los Angeles, a counseling 
agency that was cut from $70,000 to $30,000. Similarly, Children's Hospital was 
cut from $20,000 to $2,000, and Orthopaedic Hospital from $10,000 to $1,000. 
All three receive hundreds of thousands of dollars from other United Way 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit in the shift were residential programs. Vista Del Mar, a West Side 
residential facility that offers counseling, adoption and foster care services 
both in West Los Angeles and at a satellite office in the Valley, lost all but 
$5,000 of last year's $60,000 allotment. Aviva Center, a Los Angeles agency 
operating facilities for abused children, was cut from $35,000 to $5,000, the 
same as Pacific Lodge. Also severely cut were Catholic Charities and the 
Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of several of those programs said they were dismayed by the cuts and 
would have to evaluate the services they extend to the Valley. Officials with 
Family Service of Los Angeles said they will consider closing an office in 
Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The error in their ways is that they have established a philosophy and 
direction for services for kids that essentially says to the most difficult and 
the most disturbed population in our community that we don't care what happens 
to you," said Jerry Zaslaw, chief executive officer of Vista Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to focus on the younger child who is still reasonably intact 
and try and see that the risk level is reduced. That's well and good. But . . . 
while the concept of preventive services is noble, there is still going to be a 
substantial population that are not going to be able to avail themselves of 
those services." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaslaw said he was surprised by the 90% cut and will now have to readjust his 
budget, with the possibility of closing the agency's Valley satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pacific Lodge, Genders said the $5,000 he was offered this year -- a 
fraction of its $100,000 allocation five years ago -- was not enough to 
compensate for the restrictions on independent fund-raising that come with 
United Way affiliation as well as complex accounting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business decision," he said. Yet he conceded taking it personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've used this agency to sell United Way, to show it off, to show the kind 
of services that are given to the community," Genders said, his voice cracking 
with emotion. "Then they turn it around and say, 'This is not a priority.' "

FROM WAR TO PEACE; AS ARMY SOUNDS RETREAT FROM FT. ORD, BASE FINDS NEW LIFE AS 
CSU CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The barracks are empty, the windows boarded up. The soldiers have vanished, 
leaving a legacy of swords, daggers and snakes painted on the buildings they 
once occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think War," says a mural adorning one wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, a different breed of thinker will take command of this sprawling Army 
base just north of Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fall of 1995, Ft. Ord will be transformed into California State 
University Monterey Bay, the 21st campus in the state university system. 
</P>
<P>
 Army barracks will be reborn as classrooms and dormitories, mess halls will 
become dining commons, and the soldiers' sports club will be turned into a 
student union. Someday, the campus will hold as many as 25,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be we were educating people to survive war," said Hank 
Hendrickson, a former Ft. Ord garrison commander who is executive dean of the 
new university. "Now we're going to be educating people to survive the 21st 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the university system is retrenching and budget cuts have 
forced a decline in enrollment, the Monterey Bay campus stands out as an 
ambitious bid for expansion. And with military facilities slated for closure 
nationwide, 77-year-old Ft. Ord has become a model for the quick conversion of 
bases to civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
 With unemployment running as high as 13% on the Monterey Peninsula since the 
Army began pulling out, community leaders hope the new campus will continue the 
transformation of the region into a scientific research center. The area boasts 
16 marine research institutes and the newly created Monterey Bay National 
Marine Sanctuary offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they want to create an innovative campus with an emphasis on new 
technology, including a library system linked by computer to other 
universities. A new University of California graduate center focusing on 
environmental research will be established on a section of the base next to the 
CSU campus. University planners hope to forge close ties with the nearby marine 
research centers and the Defense Language Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will become the Silicon Valley of the sea," said Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel), 
who has helped push for creation of the campus. "We have been able to create 
not only a reuse of Ft. Ord but also our own economic identity." 
</P>
<P>
 For CSU, the new campus is a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Barry Munitz estimates the university system is receiving an asset 
worth $1.2 billion at a time when it does not have the resources to maintain 
its programs, much less build a university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," the chancellor said. "When so much of our news is 
depressing, this is a quite miraculous bright spot." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government is expected to pay most of the $150-million cost of 
converting the buildings for civilian use, including seismic upgrading and 
access for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Munitz acknowledged that students at other campuses where classes have been 
cut back are worried that money will be diverted to pay for Monterey Bay. But 
the chancellor pledged that he will "do everything possible" to keep that from 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal is to charge higher tuition at the new campus, he said. CSU is 
considering a two-tier system where higher fees would be charged at popular 
campuses, such as Humboldt State, Sonoma State and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
Monterey Bay may also create a service component, with students providing 
construction labor in exchange for tuition credits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope is that the campus will pay for itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although budget problems have forced the university system to cut back, state 
projections show that it will have to grow from 326,000 students today to at 
least 486,000 students by 2010 to keep pace with the state's population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monterey Bay campus will start small -- with no more than 2,000 students 
its first year -- and grow steadily as barracks, administration buildings and 
other facilities are converted to civilian use. It would reach its maximum 
capacity of 25,000 after 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 Munitz said there is no question that the campus -- a short distance from the 
ocean and close to the cities of Monterey and Carmel -- will be a popular 
place: CSU has received 2,000 unsolicited applications from professors seeking 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus will be in the heart of Ft. Ord, taking over dozens of barracks, 
administration buildings, an 8,000-seat stadium, a well-equipped gym, a church, 
bowling alley, medical clinic and a subdivision with 1,253 homes. Altogether, 
the university will receive nearly 1,400 acres with 4.4 million square feet of 
developed space. 
</P>
<P>
 Given its funding shortage, CSU does not plan to build the kind of large 
library found at most universities. Instead, the campus will establish three or 
four smaller buildings as libraries with electronic links to other 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 While CSU will serve as the core of the civilian Ft. Ord, the rest of the 
28,000-acre base will be divided among a variety of purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the land for a research center, UC will take over a toxic 
landfill and turn it into a research laboratory on waste disposal. Other 
universities and schools will get chunks of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Former military housing will be converted into homes for about 250 homeless 
people. The nearby city of Marina will take over the base airfield for a 
municipal airport. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 acres will be available for private commercial development within 
the overlapping cities of Marina and Seaside. The Army will keep about 2,000 
acres for its Presidio of Monterey Annex to provide housing for military 
personnel stationed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than half of Ft. Ord -- 16,000 acres in all -- will be set aside as a 
land preserve -- largely because unexploded bombs and buried ammunition make 
much of the land unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ft. Ord was established during World War I and rose to prominence during World 
War II, when it became one of the nation's largest Army training bases. It also 
served as a major training base for the Korean and Vietnam wars. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, the base became home for the 7th Infantry Division and barracks were 
built to serve the new, more particular volunteer Army. After the Pentagon's 
1991 decision to close Ft. Ord, the 7th Infantry Division was disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Army balked at turning the base over to civilians. Soldiers 
began stripping the post of virtually all hardware, tearing sprinklers out of 
the ground and hauling pews out of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 After members of the community and Congress protested, the Army retreated and 
adopted a more cooperative approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a good example of how not to do business," said Col. Tom Ellzey, who 
was brought in as garrison commander after the incident. "Every person in the 
Army has been brought up to build things. No one has been trained in how to 
divest land we've occupied for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, base officials say their primary mission at Ft. Ord is to help the 
Monterey region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ft. Ord realized the bottom line was not the Army's concerns but the 
community," Ellzey said. "Our goal is to provide the facilities and get on with 
business and start rebuilding the economy of the Monterey Peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, the conversion is proceeding at a faster pace than at other Army 
bases. On July 8, Defense Secretary William Perry -- a former university 
professor -- will come to Ft. Ord to give the university title to the new 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of last year, more than 15,000 troops were based at Ft. Ord. 
Now, there are only 250 soldiers left. In September, the base will officially 
be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's pure success that nobody's here," said Ellzey, who will retire in 
January after 27 years in the Army. "That's the job I was given to do." Plan 
for Peacetime 
</P>
<P>
 Ft. Ord, about 100 miles south of San Francisco, began to play a major role in 
U.S. military operations during World War II. Encompassing 44 square miles, 
much of the Army base is being turned over to the California State University 
system for a new campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights in Ft. Ord history: 
</P>
<P>
 * Named in honor of Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, who served at the Presidio of 
Monterey and later commanded Union troops in the Civil War, Camp Ord was 
established in 1917 as a maneuver area and field artillery range. 
</P>
<P>
 * During World War II, it was a major staging area for units being deployed to 
the Pacific theater. At the war's peak, it housed more than 50,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the early 1950s, troops trained at there for the Korean War. The first 
permanent barracks were built. 
</P>
<P>
 * During the 1960s, the fort was a major staging area for troops going to 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1972, it became the home station for the 7th Infantry Division, which 
remained at the fort until the fall of 1993.

RECORD BORROWING FOR BUDGET EXPECTED; LEGISLATURE: DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS 
ALIKE WANT TO ADOPT A PLAN THIS WEEK TO AVOID ANOTHER 1992-STYLE IMPASSE. 
UNIQUE POLITICAL DYNAMICS, DEFICIT COMPLICATE THIS YEAR'S SITUATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the start of the next fiscal year only days away, legislators and Gov. 
Pete Wilson will try this week to adopt an election-year budget that is almost 
certain to be propped up by the biggest borrowing in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Still smarting from a public relations drubbing they took two years ago, when 
the state went 64 days without a budget and paid its bills with IOUs, the 
Republican governor and the Democrats who control the Legislature seem to want 
nothing more than to get a budget -- any budget -- done on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their partisan differences, Democratic and Republican budget 
negotiators have agreed on some basics: funding for public schools, higher 
education and local government. They are near an accord on how much to boost 
spending for the state's fast-growing prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in dispute is how deeply to cut welfare grants -- a reduction of some 
kind is inevitable -- and the fate of two tax issues, one that affects the poor 
and one of concern to the state's wealthiest residents. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how these issues are resolved, the eventual budget is expected to 
rely on a record $7 billion in borrowing over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The political dynamics at play in this year's negotiations are unique. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Republican governor and 100 of the 120 seats in the Legislature on 
the ballot in November, the aim of most of those in the Capitol is to have a 
budget in place by Friday, the first day of the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the state's two top fiscal officers -- Treasurer Kathleen Brown and 
Controller Gray Davis -- are the Democratic nominees for governor and 
lieutenant governor and have not been as willing as their colleagues in the 
Legislature to accept some of Wilson's assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has proposed a two-year deficit financing plan that anticipates the 
receipt of $763 million this year and $2.8 billion next year from the federal 
government for the cost of providing services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Democratic legislators believe these estimates are realistic. They are 
willing to go along with Wilson because plugging those numbers into the budget 
spares them from having to raise taxes or make more painful spending cuts. They 
can simply postpone the day of reckoning for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, in contrast, wants to restructure the state's debt into a five-year 
note, which she would repay by cutting services and raising taxes. So far, her 
proposal has been all but ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis can block Wilson's proposed borrowing if he is not satisfied the state 
will have the cash on hand in two years to repay the debt, and he has said 
Wilson's hope for a $2.8-billion bailout from the federal government is 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he has demanded that legislators and the governor adopt a 
stand-by mechanism that would prompt budget cuts or tax increases if the 
state's cash runs behind projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the controller could declare a cash shortage at certain points 
between now and mid-1996. If the controller did so, the governor would be 
required to propose a plan to fix the problem. If the Legislature failed to 
adopt the governor's plan or an alternative, across-the-board reductions would 
be triggered in every program not protected by the state Constitution or 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly has scheduled a vote on the budget for Monday but the tally is 
expected to produce no more than a partisan showdown, with Republicans voting 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, the Democratic chairman of the budget-writing 
Ways and Means Committee, said the Republicans' opposition to higher taxes is 
jeopardizing basic services on which Californians depend. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't begin to understand, the public and all of us, how much the most 
precious institutions of education and health care are at risk at this point in 
time, then we all ought to forsake any notion of California ever again being a 
decent place to live, work or study," Vasconcellos said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte said few of 
Vasconcellos' fellow Democrats support higher taxes. He predicted that 
negotiations would continue even amid partisan posturing and that a final 
product that is acceptable to the required two-thirds of the members would be 
complete by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally the Democrats have always proposed a budget that they would 
wish for but which the Republicans cannot support," said Phil Perry, Brulte's 
press secretary. "But after these budgets go down to defeat the negotiations 
continue and real progress can be made." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the negotiators have agreed to give elementary and secondary schools 
enough money to keep up with enrollment, though they will still lose ground to 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Community colleges, meanwhile, would get an increase of about 4%. The governor 
wants to boost fees from $13 per unit to $20, but so far has met resistance in 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher education is in line for modest increases. The University of California 
will get a 2% increase, while the California State University system seems set 
to receive a 3.2% boost. Both systems plan to increase student fees by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 For local government, lawmakers are set to approve Wilson's proposal to shift 
$500 million in property tax revenues away from the counties. This is money the 
state tried to take a year ago. But because of a quirk in the law, the counties 
were able to avoid doing what the Legislature thought it had ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also appears ready to take $285 million away from county health 
programs -- another Wilson proposal. This cut is expected to force further 
reductions in services to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 On prisons, Wilson proposed an increase of about 10% to handle the rising 
population of inmates. Democrats had hoped to cut that growth in half but may 
give the governor what he wants because Brown, the Democratic nominee, has 
endorsed Wilson's figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation on welfare is similar. Wilson wants to reduce grants 10% 
immediately and another 15% after six months for able-bodied adults still on 
the rolls. The combined reduction would leave a mother and two children with a 
monthly cash grant of $464. They currently receive $607 each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats were insisting on no reduction in the grant, which has already 
dropped nearly $100 since Wilson took office. But Brown, in her own budget 
proposal, called for a 5% cut, making it more difficult for Democratic 
legislators to maintain their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major dispute is over taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans want to eliminate the $60 renters tax credit, which has been 
suspended for two years but is scheduled to come back on the books in 1995. 
Democrats would like to preserve the credit, which goes mostly to low-income 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, meanwhile, want to maintain a temporary surcharge on personal 
income taxes paid by the wealthy. The surcharge, enacted in 1991 and scheduled 
to expire at the end of 1995, boosts the top rate from 9.3% to 10% or 11%. The 
10% rate applies to incomes over about $100,000, while the 11% rate affects 
individuals earning more than about $200,000.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE YOUNG AND THE ANXIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The casting director glanced at the glossy photograph on her desk. A handsome 
young man named Brent smiled back at her. "Brent, Brent, Brent," she said. "Get 
a new picture. I've seen this one already, 10,000 times." She flipped the 
8-by-10 into a small trash can positioned directly behind her chair. She could 
do this without looking back. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not yet 10 a.m., but the small receptacle, marked "recycle," already 
was crammed full with photographs and resumes and just-wanted-to-touch-base 
postcards. The casting director works for a soap opera. She also is a friend, 
which is why she agreed to let me follow her around for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The only ground rule was that I avoid proper nouns and any description of new 
roles to be cast. Although it may seem all soaps are the same -- a human circus 
of confused family trees, hyperactive libidos and inoperable tumors -- the 
shows guard plot turns as closely as the Pentagon does nuclear war codes. In 
any case, my interest had nothing to do with who might turn out to be the 
biological father of little Ned or Fred. 
</P>
<P>
 My interest was with the actors, with that relentless core of dreamers who 
arrive in Los Angeles with nice smiles and long resumes and little real chance 
of ever finding steady work before a camera. My interest was in the yearning -- 
an old theme, perhaps, but always compelling -- and the daily mail call was a 
good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot express through a letter," wrote an actor named Matt from Chicago, 
"how much I want . . . an opportunity to be a part of something as special as," 
and here he named the show. Typical, my friend said, flipping it into the bin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope," sniffed another correspondent, "that I haven't done anything to 
offend you . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A little too sensitive, she said. You need a thick skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," she said, scanning a resume, "here's a guy who knows how to work a 
pressure hose steam cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
 She noticed one actor's height and put down his resume. Too short. She looked 
at a picture -- "maybe this guy looks a little too much like O.J. Simpson." She 
picked up a postcard. "Eric," it said, "is a serious actor -- when he's not 
playing a purple dinosaur at children's birthday parties." She paused now to 
remember other gimmicks. Once an actor delivered his resume by homing pigeon. 
Several have attached their pictures to bars of soaps -- soaps, get it? She 
remembered a letter that began: "My child just had heart surgery and I need a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the mail winds up in the trash. The bookcases in her small office are 
crammed with binders that contain pictures of applicants. There are stacks of 
videotapes, piles of unfiled resumes. Near her desk hangs a blank contract form 
listing the standard day rate -- $580, plus 10% for the agent. A television set 
provides a live feed of taping under way in a nearby studio: "All right, 
buster," an actress tells an actor, "it's your turn to hand me that suntan 
lotion." 
</P>
<P>
 In front of her desk is a chair. Here, actors who had been invited to audition 
for various parts -- a triumph in its own right -- would sit and read snatches 
of dialogue. The chair squeaked, but only the most confident applicants dared 
to make light of it. Quite a few, though, took pains to inquire politely about 
the casting director's children. "They are always nice," she said through a 
smile, "to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I saw maybe 25 actors come through the door. Hip young men dressed in black; 
grandma-types in wheelchairs -- careful, careful, no secrets. Most seemed 
pretty good, with resumes that listed years of theater work and special 
training. Some were noticeably nervous. "Can I start over again?" one croaked. 
His mouth had gone dry. Another flushed when my friend looked at his resume and 
read aloud how many years he'd been in Los Angeles, trying. "Has it been that 
long?" he said. "My God. I guess I am in denial about that." 
</P>
<P>
 One young optimist wore a beeper; it never beeped. Others came in already 
defeated. "Let's do this," one older actor said grimly, slumping into the 
chair. And indeed, all but one or two left as they had arrived -- one more 
actor without a role, one more steam cleaner operator yearning to break 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life I have had trouble breaking hearts," my friend said afterward. 
"And now I am in a job where I have to do it every day." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked her how many of them are out there. "Oh," she said. "Lots and lots and 
lots and lots and lots. Tons and tons and tons." And that they have cast 
themselves into a story about as compelling as anything on screen comforts them 
not at all.

 Two Somali clans fought each other with mortars and automatic weapons in a 
battle that raged around U.N. headquarters in Mogadishu for hours. About 30 
Somalis were killed and an estimated 300 were wounded. Three foreigners, 
including two U.N. peacekeepers, were slightly wounded by stray bullets that 
fell inside the walled, heavily fortified U.N. headquarters and at the city's 
airport, which is a U.N. supply base.

JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER HATA'S STATUS GETS BOOST AFTER RESIGNATION; ASIA: HE IS 
SEEN AS LEADER WILLING TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF. ADDED STATURE MAY HELP HIM REGAIN 
JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's outgoing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the "nice guy" who coalition 
leaders hoped could end bickering in their ranks by the sheer force of his 
cheerful personality, emerged from his resignation Saturday with heightened 
status as a leader willing to sacrifice himself for a greater goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The new stature might even help him win his job back when maneuvering to patch 
together a new coalition begins in earnest this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a parliamentary no-confidence motion he could not defeat, Hata could 
have fought back by calling a general election in which his own Renewal Party 
stood to score the biggest gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Hata gave up the premiership and even risked allowing the Liberal 
Democratic Party to regain a slice of the power it lost last summer after 
ruling Japan for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the rebellious Socialists return to the coalition, no government can be 
formed without the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other nations kept a watchful eye on events in Tokyo. Hata's 
resignation adds another element of uncertainty to world financial markets, 
which were riled last week as the dollar plunged to a post-World War II low 
against the Japanese yen -- sparking a global selloff in stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's weakness has been blamed in part on the stalled negotiations 
between the United States and Japan to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus. With 
Japan again leaderless, global investors fear that there is no prospect for 
progress in the trade talks, and thus the dollar may be forced lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before Hata resigned, Minoru Morita, a respected political 
commentator, predicted that if the prime minister called a general election for 
July, Hata's party would increase its strength in Parliament by at least 50%. 
His major adversaries, the Liberal Democrats and the Socialists, by contrast, 
would suffer setbacks, Morita predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata confessed to Japanese reporters that he had thought of allowing a vote on 
the Liberal Democrats' no-confidence motion and ordering a general election 
after its expected passage. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, he said, was preserving electoral reform won only after a 
five-year struggle, avoiding more than a month of political vacuum and not 
sending another leader with shaky credentials to an economic summit of advanced 
industrial democracies. The Group of Seven is to meet next month in Naples, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata's resignation Saturday wiped out the no-confidence motion and the 
possibility of an election that would have been held under the old system of 
multi-seat districts that, critics say, promote pork-barrel politics. 
Redistricting into single-seat constituencies has not yet been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the record of my 25 years in politics," he said at his resignation 
news conference. "I have never acted for individual benefit. I have always 
thought of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 No one contradicted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, whose help the coalition 
needs to regain a majority, praised him. No criticism at all was made of 
anything he had done during his brief two months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in submitting their no-confidence motion, the Liberal Democrats 
complained only about the meager 37% of lower-house seats left to the coalition 
after its biggest member, the Socialists, walked out April 12, hours after 
helping elect Hata prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, when Hata offered to quit to meet a Socialist demand for a 
face-saving reason for their rejoining the coalition, he presumed that he had 
the Socialists' support in a new election for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, the Socialists reneged on earlier promises and declared that they 
would not support Hata again. 
</P>
<P>
 New names started appearing on the dartboard of possibilities for Japan's 
seventh prime minister in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were Socialist Chairman Murayama and Masayoshi Takemura, head of 
the splinter New Party Harbinger who served as chief Cabinet secretary in the 
eight-month Cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, who said he would "entrust my future to Parliament," remained near the 
center of the board. Near the edge was Yohei Kono, the Liberal Democrats' 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura suggested that Socialist leader Murayama become prime minister and 
that a new Cabinet be built around the Socialists, instead of Hata's Renewal 
Party whose deputy, Ichiro Ozawa, is an archenemy of Takemura. 
</P>
<P>
 Koichi Kato, a rising star in the Liberal Democratic Party, said Kono, his 
party's chief, "would be best" but named both Murayama and Takemura as leaders 
whom the Liberal Democrats could support in an LDP-Socialist-Harbinger 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama rejected any attempt to form a coalition "at this time" with the 
Socialists' traditional enemy, the LDP, saying his party would first try to 
work out terms of a new alliance with the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kono handed him a copy of a Liberal Democrat coalition platform Saturday 
afternoon, the Socialist leader replied only, "I'll read it carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Hata said he was resigning in hopes that a new Cabinet, united on policy and 
fortified with a strong base, could be formed. But there was no guarantee of 
such a government emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new single-seat electoral system is expected to force an 
amalgamation of Japan's myriad parties, so far the old political structure has 
been splintering, not regrouping. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 15 different parties and groups in Parliament, and unity is 
reported badly frayed within the Liberal Democrats and the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 More splits could occur in the effort to build a new coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators have compared the idea of blending the Socialists and the 
conservative Liberal Democrats into a coalition with trying to mix oil and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Socialists rejoin the coalition, they would remain at odds with its 
other parties over tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
 A return of international tensions over how to deal with suspected North 
Korean development of nuclear weapons almost certainly would stir a fight 
between the Socialists, who oppose sanctions and insist on dialogue, and the 
rest of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the turmoil that has forced out two prime ministers in the last three 
months appears to have taken its biggest toll on U.S.-Japan economic relations.

 Haiti watched its international isolation grow as flights between the island 
nation and the United States came to a halt.The ban on commercial flights, 
which went into effect Saturday morning, is the Clinton Administration's latest 
attempt to dislodge the military and restore ousted President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. The last U.S. plane out of Haiti was American Airlines Flight 658, 
which left Port-au-Prince for New York at 5:30 p.m. Friday. A Haiti Trans-Air 
flight left for Miami at 6:30 p.m. U.S. Ambassador William Swing escorted 40 
Haitians awarded asylum onto the final American flight.

S. KOREANS MARK WAR'S ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korea marked the 44th anniversary Saturday of the outbreak of the Korean 
War with low-key public ceremonies but mounting backstage activity aimed at 
breaking half a century of bitter national division. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans gathered at Seoul's National Cemetery to honor the millions killed in 
the 1950-53 conflict, which confirmed the post-World War II division of the 
peninsula into capitalist South and Communist North. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands attended a rally in the capital's Olympic Park calling for peaceful 
unification of the two Koreas. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's anniversary comes at a time of mounting hopes that faltering steps 
toward reconciliation might this time produce results. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea on Saturday notified the South of the names of a high-powered 
delegation that will meet Seoul officials Tuesday in a bid to arrange a 
historic summit meeting between the presidents of the two Koreas.

FAILED RWANDA TRUCE HALTS EVACUATION; CENTRAL AFRICA: U.N. SUSPENDS PLAN TO 
MOVE 600 REFUGEES. FRANCE DEPLOYS MORE TROOPS TO REGION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations called off plans to move 600 refugees out of battered 
Kigali on Saturday after a newly struck truce between rebel and government 
forces collapsed within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 France sent more troops in on the third day of its U.N.-authorized mission to 
stop the bloodshed, raising its total to about 1,000 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The French forces, based in border towns in Zaire, sent scouts by helicopter 
to western and southwestern Rwanda to check on the needs of hundreds of 
thousands of refugees fleeing the ethnic slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The French Defense Ministry said other European countries may send troops to 
the central African nation, and Italy said it will send a fact-finding mission 
to Rwanda to determine if its troops can help with relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy fighting in Kigali since Monday has made it impossible for the United 
Nations to safely get refugees out of the chaotic city. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 people, mostly children, were to be evacuated from St. Michel 
Cathedral in Kigali to the eastern suburb of Kabuga, and an equal number were 
to be transferred from King Faisal Hospital in rebel territory to Runda, 12 
miles west. 
</P>
<P>
 But heavy artillery fire broke a truce struck a few hours earlier Saturday, 
making the rescue impossible, said a U.N. military spokesman, Maj. Jean-Guy 
Plante. 
</P>
<P>
 A lull in the fighting did allow 70 people to be taken from the overcrowded 
Red Cross hospital, which is in the government-controlled area and has 
repeatedly come under fire, to King Faisal Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A mortar shell that hit the Red Cross hospital Friday killed at least seven 
patients, Red Cross officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three months of war between Hutu-dominated government forces and 
Tutsi-led rebels has left hundreds of thousands of civilians dead, mostly in 
Hutu massacres of the Tutsi ethnic minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels made a push for the capital this week, fearing anticipated French 
military intervention would rob them of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 France sent the first of 2,500 troops into Rwanda on Thursday, saying their 
mission is to prevent more killing, not to take sides in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rome, Italy's foreign and defense ministries issued a statement saying they 
would send a team to the Uganda-Rwanda border to "check out the possibilities 
of involvement of the armed forces" in such missions as guarding hospitals or 
escorting refugee convoys.

N.Y. BOMB PLOT FIGURE FIRES LAWYER, MAY TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of 13 defendants accused of plotting to bomb New York landmarks has fired 
lawyer William Kunstler and apparently decided to testify for the government, 
Kunstler's office said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an angry letter to U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, Kunstler and 
partner Ronald Kuby said they were advised Friday that the suspect, Siddig 
Ibrahim Siddig Ali, had hired a new attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said he had been moved from the federal detention center without 
their knowledge and that they had been unable to locate Siddig Ali's wife to 
find out what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "After spending a year vilifying Siddig Ali and portraying him as a terrorist 
mastermind deserving of life imprisonment, prosecutors will now rely on his 
testimony," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no official confirmation that Siddig Ali had become a government 
witness. He would be the second of an original 15 defendants to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Atty. Mary Jo White, said Saturday that 
the office was not commenting on the case. Howard Leader, a New York attorney 
who told the court he was Siddig Ali's new defense lawyer, did not return 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddig Ali, 32, of Jersey City, N.J., is one of 13 men accused of 
participating in a radical Muslim ring that planned to assassinate key figures 
and bomb the United Nations building, a federal office complex and New York 
bridges and tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 Their trial is scheduled for September. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities say the plot was indirectly linked to the bombing of New 
York's World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993. Four other men were convicted 
earlier this year in that case and are serving life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those accused in the second case is Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, a blind 
Egyptian cleric who prosecutors allege was the instigator of both plots. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Abdul Rahman, Siddig Ali and the others include 
conspiracy, conspiracy to murder, bombing conspiracy and use and carrying of 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 15 defendants originally charged, one has already pleaded guilty to lesser 
charges and another opted to testify for the government.

FAY DESCRIBES CANING, SEEING RESULTING SCARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Fay, the U.S. teen-ager who was caned in Singapore for vandalism, said 
prison officials told him he shouted "I'm dying!" when the first stroke was 
delivered but he could not remember making the cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay said in an interview Friday that a prison officer stood beside him and 
guided him through the ordeal saying: "OK, Michael, three left; OK, Michael, 
two left; OK, one more, you're almost done." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the four strokes with a cane that he received seven weeks ago had left 
three dark-brown scar patches on his right buttock and four lines, each about 
half-an-inch wide, on his left buttock. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old said he looked at the scars in a mirror only two days ago, 
after being freed from prison and returning to his father's home here, and "I 
got a shiver down my back, and I couldn't believe I might have them here for 
the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the caning, which he estimated took one minute, left a "few streaks of 
blood" running down his buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But his description of the punishment appeared less horrific than accounts of 
caning in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skin did rip open, there was some blood. I mean, let's not exaggerate, 
and let's not say a few drops or that the blood was gushing out. It was in 
between the two. It's like a bloody nose," Fay said.

WEARY DEMOCRATS GET ON THE OFFENSIVE; POLITICS: PARTY LEADERS DEFEND CLINTON 
AGENDA AND ACCUSE GOP OF BEING TAKEN OVER BY 'RADICAL RIGHT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weary of defending themselves and their President from attacks by the GOP, 
Democrats are girding to strike back hard, accusing Republicans of 
obstructionism in Congress and of coming under the sway of the "radical right." 
</P>
<P>
 The broad outlines of their strategy emerged here during a three-day gathering 
of party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally figured out what our message (to voters) is," said Don Sweitzer, 
the party's national political director. "Either go forward with Clinton and 
deal with the nation's problems or go back to the Republicans and gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides plotting a counterattack, the Democrats devoted considerable effort to 
lifting the spirits of state party leaders, many of whom have become frustrated 
and discouraged by a steady flow of reports about President Clinton's personal 
problems and the party's gloomy prospects in this fall's off-year voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every speaker paid tribute to Clinton's accomplishments, particularly 
revitalization of the economy, and to his goals, especially enactment of health 
care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have created an agenda that Democrats can run on, can run proudly on and 
can win on," said presidential pollster Stanley B. Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heartiest applause came in response to the hard-edged rhetoric of 
Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm, who took aim at the self-described 
conservative Christians, whom he branded the "radical right." He accused such 
groups, which have scored successes in intraparty clashes in Virginia, Texas 
and Minnesota, of trying to use religion to "coerce" political support for 
their controversial views. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party has a problem," Wilhelm said. "Its state parties are 
rapidly being taken over by the forces of the radical right, the very same 
people who brought us the 1992 Republican convention in Houston." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are as committed to their religious beliefs as conservative 
Christians are to theirs, Wilhelm said, but "our faith leads us to different 
conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to Minnesota GOP gubernatorial candidate Allen Quist, who 
reportedly referred in a speech to a "genetic predisposition" that better 
enables men to be heads of households. He also challenged remarks by religious 
broadcaster Pat Robertson, who once defined the feminist agenda as one that 
"encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice 
witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
 While conceding that conservative Christians are entitled to their beliefs, 
Wilhelm said other Americans "have the right, even the obligation, to challenge 
those views and to do so without being labeled bigots." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm's criticism of conservative Christians echoed comments last week by 
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee, as well as Clinton. They appeared to be part of a broad 
Democratic effort to make Republicans pay a price for the support of 
conservative Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilhelm also had other arrows in his quiver. Among them was a sample 
television commercial ridiculing House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia 
for opposing health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 After depicting a blue-collar worker who was without health care coverage 
after 16 years on the job, the ad shows a picture of Gingrich. "This man has 
also worked for 16 years at the same job," the narrator says. "He has great 
health care coverage. . . . Tell him if it's good enough for him, it's good 
enough for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Another tactic proposed for Democratic candidates was to turn Republican 
optimism about taking control of the Senate in November into an argument 
against the party's candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, party officials noted that a Republican-controlled Senate would 
mean that conservative Jesse Helms of North Carolina would chair the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, South Carolina's Strom Thurmond would head the 
Judiciary Committee and New York's Alfonse M. D'Amato would head the Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "So let's be clear about the stakes in a race like the one for the U.S. Senate 
here in California," Wilhelm told the group, saying that a vote for Rep. 
Michael Huffington, the Santa Barbara Republican challenging Democratic 
incumbent Dianne Feinstein, "in a very real way is a vote for Jesse Helms, a 
vote for Al D'Amato and a vote for Strom Thurmond." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are also high in the House, said Rep. Bill Richardson of New 
Mexico, who is vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and chief 
deputy whip of the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats control the House with 256 seats (the Republicans have 178 and 
there is one independent) and while almost no one believes they will lose their 
numerical majority, Richardson warned that any significant loss could cut into 
the party's "operating majority" of about 40 seats. Those seats are held by 
Democrats who can be counted on to support Clinton on most key votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson urged the state party leaders to use their influence with members 
of Congress to lobby for support of Clinton's health care proposal, arguing 
that its enactment could be a decisive factor in the fall elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the defining moment," he said. "If we don't produce, the voters 
will not take it out on the institution of Congress, they will take it out on 
the majority party."

TURNING UP HEAT ON TOBACCO FIRMS; AS TAXPAYER-FUNDED ANTI-SMOKING ADS GET 
BOLDER, SOME SAY THEY OVERSTATE THE DANGERS OF CIGARETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surely you've seen it: the television commercial depicting a tobacco executive 
telling a series of lies, his head shrinking into his collar as he repeatedly 
contradicts himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally his head vanishes in a puff of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the ad that follows a smoker through his day, numbering the 
people who come into contact with his secondhand smoke -- 37 people, including 
his wife and daughter, who "will die a little, because they were forced to 
breathe the smoke from his cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, California's Department of Health Services has been buying time on 
television and radio and space on billboards to change public attitudes about 
smoking. These ads have won the enmity of the tobacco industry as well as 
numerous national and international media awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent commercials, many of them targeting teen-agers and emphasizing 
the dangers of secondhand smoke, are tougher than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there has never been a media campaign quite like this before -- and 
you would have to look at negative political ads to find advertising that 
attacks the opposition with such joyful abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 These messages, with their savage bite, are the most visible use of the 
25-cents-a-pack tobacco tax included in Proposition 99, the voter-approved 
anti-smoking initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure did not mention a media campaign at all, but the legislation that 
authorized spending of the tax money required one and gave state officials only 
four months to begin it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been nothing like this ever before in the rest of the world," said 
Colleen Stevens, who heads the state's anti-tobacco media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some evidence that the ads have been working. A period of rapid 
decline in cigarette sales in California coincides with the launching of the 
first barrage of ads in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stevens, a career health administrator with a degree in social work, 
began to put together the first advertising campaign, she had nowhere to turn 
for advice. California health officials had produced educational health films 
and public service messages before -- mostly low-budget announcements shown at 
no cost at odd hours on commercial television. But this was to be an ambitious 
program with a big-time budget -- more than $28 million in the first two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But public health officials point out that the amount is a pittance compared 
to what tobacco companies are spending to peddle their products -- an estimated 
$1 million a day in California. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, the ads took aim at the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the early spots portrayed a corporate executive asking his colleagues 
to help him solve a problem. "We need more cigarette smokers," he declares. 
"Pure and simple. Every day, two thousand Americans stop smoking and another 
1,100 also quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, technically, they die. That means that this business needs three 
thousand fresh, new volunteers every day. So, forget about all that heart 
disease, cancer, emphysema, stroke stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before the department was going to release the first commercials, 
then-Gov. George Deukmejian got his first look at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials waited in suspense for several days before Deukmejian, a 
pro-business conservative, delivered judgment on the campaign. The ads ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson suspended the ad campaign in 1992 during one of the state's 
seemingly never-ending budget crises. The American Lung Assn. successfully sued 
to restore the funding. But Wilson's action interrupted advertising for many 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the lawsuit, the governor has been protective of the tobacco-control 
media budget. In January, he called for spending $12.9 million on the ad 
campaign in the coming fiscal year -- the same level as this year. But 
recently, he cut $2 million from that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens praises Wilson's support for the ad campaign: "I think this is a 
governor who believes in prevention, and (smoking) is the No. 1 preventable 
cause of death and disability in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 She agrees with observers who say the most recent commercials and billboards 
make the earlier media campaign seem tame by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding ways of making our messages clearer and more meaningful," 
Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using market research techniques, the health department has learned how to 
target its messages -- aiming at teen-agers and members of ethnic groups that 
have relatively high smoking rates. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, the state has bought advertising time on the Fox Network, 
which has high viewership among young people and minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the state has been reaching out to a youthful audience by airing ads 
on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's outdoor advertising campaign emphasizes the effect of smoking 
on nonsmokers: "Try secondhand smoke!" states one recent billboard. "Get all of 
the effects of smoking without those pesky filters! Secondhand smoke kills." 
</P>
<P>
 A television ad states that "5,100 Californians die every year from breathing 
secondhand smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 These and other ads have prompted complaints from pro-smoking groups, charging 
that the messages overstate dangers to nonsmokers by assuming a national death 
rate due to secondhand smoke of 50,000 deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the Environmental Protection Agency (which concluded that secondhand 
smoke can cause cancer) won't endorse 50,000 deaths a year," said Bob Merrell, 
who heads Californians for Smokers' Rights.

BOSNIA CEASE-FIRE TALKS CALLED OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnia's latest cease-fire was close to collapsing Saturday after the United 
Nations failed to bring the warring sides together to talk about salvaging it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government's meeting with the commander of the Bosnian Serb 
army and U.N. representatives would have sought to prolong the monthlong truce, 
already rocked in the last week by renewed conflict, beyond July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The unstable cease-fire, the first overall truce called since the conflict 
began, was intended to provide a breathing space for the work of international 
mediators. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose of Britain, had hoped 
talks would cool main battlefronts and produce a pact to curb recent sniper 
fire in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. spokesman, Maj. Rob Annink, said senior military and political 
officials of the Muslim-led government balked at taking part in the meeting. 
They apparently wanted to discuss only an agreement to stop sniper attacks. 
That was not enough for the Serbs, who had been agreeable to a meeting of top 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Annink said the United Nations was trying to get the two sides to meet today. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more reports Saturday of artillery fire in northern and central 
Bosnia, Annink said. He said most of the fighting apparently was provoked by 
government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 While he refused to characterize the cease-fire as useless, he agreed that 
violence was increasing daily.

WINDS, HEAT FAN BRUSH FIRES IN 4 COUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scorching temperatures and high winds fanned wildfires across Southern 
California on Saturday, as hundreds of firefighters in four counties battled 
blazes that left more than 4,000 acres charred and a handful of homes 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported in any of the fires, the largest of which broke out 
in Angeles National Forest in eastern Los Angeles County about 11:30 a.m. In 
that blaze, flames quickly skipped the San Bernardino County line, consuming an 
estimated 2,000 acres near Pinon Hills by early evening, when about 800 
firefighters from the two counties began to get the upper hand, said Los 
Angeles County fire dispatcher Cheryl Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 houses and one mobile home were destroyed in the fire, which sent 
many residents fleeing with their livestock. The Red Cross set up a relief 
station at Pinon Mesa Middle School in Phelan, Fire Department Inspector 
Michael Chuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside County, about 45 miles east of Hemet, another fire blackened 850 
acres. No damage was reported, but evacuation orders were issued for the city 
of Anza. Firefighters had contained about a third of the fire by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the expensive west San Fernando Valley enclave of Porter Ranch, a brush 
fire erupted just before 4 p.m. above a tract of homes in the 19000 block of 
West Kilfinan Street and burned about 60 acres, said Jim Wells, a spokesman for 
the Los Angeles City Fire Department. The fire was contained by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 500 acres burned in Angeles National Forest, Patterson said. The fire 
apparently erupted at the Kentucky Springs Shooting Range on Kentucky Springs 
Road and Angeles Crest Highway. The blaze was still out of control at 8 p.m., 
Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County firefighters contained a brush fire that burned about 700 acres 
near Olinda Village on Saturday night. No structures were damaged, but one 
firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>

 A Senate committee has approved a bill to allow gay and other unmarried 
couples to officially register their relationships with the state and share

<P>
 The measure would set up a legal framework for domestic partnerships, require 
hospitals to include such domestic partners in family-only patient visits, and 
revise state laws relating to wills and conservatorships. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a half-million unmarried couples in California who live together 
and provide warm and loving homes," Katz said. "My bill gives these couples a 
few basic rights."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; THEIR LIPS ARE SEALED; BUT GRAND JURY MEMBERS TALK 
ABOUT HOW GRUESOME ACCOUNTS AFFECT THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are 23 people in Los Angeles who share a terrible secret. They have 
heard much of the evidence gathered in the murder case against O.J. Simpson but 
have promised not to tell a soul. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the members of the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, ordinary citizens 
who volunteered for a year of public service and took an oath of secrecy. After 
hearing five days of testimony, they were unceremoniously removed from the 
Simpson case Friday before they could decide whether the former football star 
should be indicted on charges of killing his ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the jurors face the burden of not revealing anything that they learned 
about the grisly case when it is the subject of constant news reports and the 
primary topic of conversation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human nature being what it is, what good is a secret if you can't tell 
anybody?" said former Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. "You have to validate it by 
telling somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a handful of grand jurors have talked with The Times about the Simpson 
case, including one who was so disturbed by seeing pictures of the bloody crime 
scene that he was unable to eat dinner afterward. "It was a traumatic 
experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of the grand jurors in the Simpson case is similar to the 
experience of grand jurors who have served in the past. They heard gruesome 
accounts of high-profile murders -- such as the Menendez case or the 1991 San 
Gabriel Valley mall murders -- but are forbidden from discussing them with 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disturbing to hear the gory details," said Emma Fischbeck, who 
served on the grand jury in 1988-89 and again in 1991-92. "It's something you 
have to adjust your life to be able to cope with. It's like hearing a really 
scary story when you're a kid. Your gut aches." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand jurors who served during the 1992-93 session and heard testimony in the 
case of Erik and Lyle Menendez said the image of the boys' murdered parents -- 
presented by the district attorney in blown-up photographs -- will stay with 
them for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was such an unusual case," said Richard Mankiewicz, one of the grand 
jurors. "It was such a high-profile case and it was a terrible murder, blowing 
people's heads apart, one is unlikely to forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, former grand jurors say, they got a chance to work through their 
feelings in each case as they deliberated whether to return an indictment. But 
with Friday's ruling, jurors in the Simpson case were deprived of the 
opportunity to discuss the case among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think they would be very frustrated after being put through the 
wringer on something like this and then not be able to make a decision," said 
another former grand juror on the Menendez case who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have served on the Los Angeles County Grand Jury say that being on 
the panel is a stressful experience -- and not just because of the horrible 
crimes that they are exposed to. Grand jury members are expected to serve as 
watchdogs over local government operations while juggling indictments in 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand jurors volunteer or are nominated by judges and then are selected for 
the one-year post at random from a pool of candidates. Jurors are paid $25 a 
day for what is essentially a full-time job. As a result, most members of the 
grand jury are retired and elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the kind of people who end up on the panel understand their 
social responsibility and willingly take on the burden of keeping confidential 
matters secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you have gone through that screening process, you end up with people who 
are able to handle the situation," said former Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Robert 
Philibosian. "They are not weaklings. They are strong people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some former jurors say the workload is taxing and the strain of 
serving on the panel can contribute to health problems; during the 1992-93 
session, two members had heart attacks and one died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have the choice of taking a criminal case to the grand jury for an 
indictment or holding a preliminary hearing before a judge. Prosecutors often 
prefer going before the grand jury because defense lawyers are not allowed in 
the room and witnesses are not cross-examined. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury does not decide whether a defendant is guilty, but whether 
there is enough evidence for a trial. In most cases, grand juries take whatever 
action the prosecution recommends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure you've heard the statement that grand juries would indict a ham 
sandwich," Mankiewicz said. "They are flunkies of the district attorney. I 
believe that grand juries in general are predisposed to go along with the 
district attorney in handing down indictments." 
</P>
<P>
 Mankiewicz is among those who believe the grand jury is so overloaded with 
crime cases that it is unable to fulfill its function as a watchdog over local 
government. He recommends convening two grand juries, one to handle civil 
functions and the other to hear criminal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In criminal cases, grand jury members are told never to discuss the case 
except when they are in the jury room and all members of the panel are present. 
</P>
<P>
 Like trial jurors, they also are not supposed to hear evidence outside the 
courtroom and can be recused from a case if they become tainted. During the 
Menendez case, one grand juror reported that she had driven by the house where 
the murders occurred. She was excused from further participation in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Some former panel members speculated that publicity in the Simpson case has 
been so widespread that some jurors may have accidentally heard news reports 
and had to disqualify themselves. If that had happened to enough members, they 
noted, the grand jury would not have been able to muster the 14 votes needed to 
return an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischbeck, president of the Los Angeles County Grand Jurors Assn., an 
organization of former panel members, said one reason grand juries hold private 
sessions is to shield prominent suspects from public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to protect the reputations of people like Michael Jackson and 
O.J. Simpson if you can have hearings without publicity," she said. "But 
apparently there is a way of getting this information out to the press and that 
ruins the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the worst crimes that came before the grand jury during her tenure 
were the mall murders, a series of brutal killings in the San Gabriel Valley by 
gang members who kidnaped their victims at random from a shopping mall and 
other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were defenseless people and without provocation and without reason they 
were killed," Fischbeck said. "It's hard to cope with this kind of thing."

$800,000 STOLEN FROM BASEMENT; 5 HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 91-year-old man amassed $800,000 in his basement since the Depression 
because he did not trust the banks. He did, however, trust a woman who cleaned 
his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, authorities have accused the woman and four others of sneaking into the 
man's house while he slept, hauling away cash, gold coins and securities and 
spending the take on cars, vacations and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to wring their necks," the robbery victim said Saturday from his 
home in Barnesboro, Pa., a town of 2,700 people about 75 miles east of 
Pittsburgh. He asked that his name not be used because he's afraid of being 
robbed again. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a widower, coin collector and retired coal miner, noticed that the 
money was missing in early May but did not report the theft until June 3, 
Barnesboro Mayor Mike Suchar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested five people last week, two of them as they returned from a 
Florida vacation, Suchar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said one of the suspects told the others about a padlocked strongbox 
she noticed while cleaning the man's basement. The group entered the house 
while the man slept and broke the lock on the strongbox, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $60,000 in cash has been recovered. Suchar said the securities, which 
were payable only to the victim, may have been burned.

SAN DIEGO EMERGES AS MODEL IN HANDLING SPOUSE ABUSE CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office need look only toward its 
neighbor to the south for what is hailed as a model for handling spousal abuse 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego County, 20 full-time prosecutors -- 11 deputies in the district 
attorney's office and nine in the city attorney's office -- are devoted 
exclusively to domestic violence. The resources used to battle the problem of 
spousal abuse are unrivaled. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Orange County has two full-time prosecutors, and the part-time 
services of another 10 who handle a heavy load of other criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are considered the model, which is encouraging, but it is also 
discouraging because I know how far we have to go," said Casey G. Gwinn, head 
deputy city attorney and supervising attorney of the domestic violence unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the city attorney's office handle both misdemeanor cases and felonies 
that started as misdemeanors. The district attorney's office handles felony 
cases countywide and all misdemeanors outside the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwinn said that although he is pleased with the county's overall felony filing 
rate -- the highest of the six most-populous counties -- and its high rate of 
convictions for both felonies and misdemeanors, he is much more proud of the 
decrease in homicides related to domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the county had 30 such homicides. The number lowered to 22 in 1991 
and decreased to nine in both 1992 and 1993. So far this year, there have been 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what distinguishes us from the rest of the country," Gwinn said. "We 
review every death resulting from a domestic dispute and try and figure out how 
it could have (been) handled differently." 
</P>
<P>
 The policies employed by the domestic violence units in San Diego County are 
heralded nationwide as among the most aggressive and effective because they 
don't require the victim to sign a formal complaint and do not allow the victim 
to drop charges or press charges once the case is submitted to the unit by a 
law enforcement agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, local police stopped asking victims whether they wanted to press 
charges back in 1986. That decision is left to prosecutors, who don't even need 
the victim's cooperation to move forward with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims do not testify in about 60% of San Diego's cases, Gwinn said, and when 
they do, they often do so on behalf of the defense, not the prosecution. 
Prosecutors usually rely on neighbors, children, photographs, police reports, 
911 emergency tapes and other evidence to prove their cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the success of the San Diego model, observers say, comes from its 
Domestic Violence Council, which consists of a 16-member executive committee 
that includes prosecutors, judges, probation officials, police and sheriff's 
administrators, and members of victims advocate programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Stephenson, the deputy district attorney in charge of the family 
protection division, said San Diego County's attack on domestic abuse works 
because everyone, from cops to judges to counselors, is devoted toward the same 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that makes San Diego County unique is that everyone works 
together," she said. "I go to a lot of counties and people say, 'You talk to 
each other?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Anne O'Dell is one of three sergeants and 24 sworn officers from the San 
Diego Police Department devoted solely to handling crimes of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a mind-set in San Diego County," she said. "It's not a panacea, 
but we have enough people here working on this problem to make a hell of a 
difference."

MAGIC WILL BUY INTO THE LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: HE IS EXPECTED TO ACQUIRE LESS 
THAN 10% OF THE TEAM AND GET A FRONT-OFFICE ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Magic Johnson is on the verge of becoming a part-owner of the Lakers in a deal 
that could be closed as soon as this week, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact amount of the acquisition is not known, but it is not believed to 
exceed 10%. Johnson, who led the Lakers to five NBA championships and spent the 
final 16 games of 1993-94 as interim coach, would apparently also have a 
front-office role. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker spokesman John Black declined to comment. Agent Lon Rosen declined to 
identify whom Johnson is negotiating with, but said: 
</P>
<P>
 "The only comment I can make is that he is getting very close to making an 
announcement about an association with a team. We're very close. . . . He will 
be ready to make an announcement in the very near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not just going to be involved with the basketball operations. He's going 
to be involved with all aspects of this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has turned much of his attention toward ownership since retiring in 
the fall of 1992. He was part of the group that lost out in the bid for the 
expansion franchise in Toronto and reportedly was involved with several others 
in trying to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Rank of Louisiana agreed to pay $152.5 million for the Timberwolves in 
hopes of moving the team to New Orleans, but that purchase was later overturned 
by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's talks with the Lakers have been serious for some time, so much so 
that Commissioner David Stern has known about the impending sale since early in 
the NBA finals. Johnson attended several of the games in New York and Houston 
and sat with Stern for Game 7 at the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers is are the only organization Johnson has been with as a pro since 
leaving Michigan State in 1979. The relationship with owner Jerry Buss is one 
Johnson describes as father-son. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has been providing opinions on players for years. And, for someone who 
didn't want to coach partly because it would mean time away from family, he 
wouldn't have to travel. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, still hoping to trade up from the 10th pick in Wednesday's draft, 
offered Vlade Divac to Detroit for the No. 3 spot, but didn't get far. It would 
take much more to entice them to give up the selection they want to use for 
Duke's Grant Hill. If Hill goes second to Dallas, the Pistons then might be 
more willing to listen to trade offers rather than take Jason Kidd a year after 
using a first-round pick on another point guard, Lindsey Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Laker Byron Scott might turn what appeared to be a brief stint with the 
Indiana Pacers into a multiyear contract. The holdup on length seems to be 
whether it should be for two years or three.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; SURVIVAL 
COURSE: ONLY 16 CAN PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES

<P>
 If Colombia does not defeat Switzerland in Palo Alto this afternoon, it will 
be flying home to Bogota and a very unpleasant welcome from the country's 
soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if Morocco cannot find a way to beat the Netherlands in Orlando, 
Fla., on Wednesday, it will be on the next flight back to Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
 It's win-or-be-ousted time in the World Cup as the third series of first-round 
matches kicks off. From now on, every game will have something more on the line 
and every result will have added meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday night, eight of the 24 World Cup teams will have been eliminated 
-- the six fourth-place finishers and the two teams with the worst records 
among third-place teams -- and the tournament will be poised to move into the 
knockout phase. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only three teams -- Brazil, Argentina and Belgium -- have guaranteed 
themselves a berth in the final 16. An additional four teams -- Switzerland, 
the United States, Germany and Sweden -- are all but mathematically certain of 
a place in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves 17 teams fighting for the remaining nine places, with some in much 
better position than others. The winners and runners-up in each group advance, 
along with the four with the best record among third-place teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown of who will play whom when and where is impossible to figure out 
at this point since the possibilities are numerous. Here, however, is a 
breakdown of what each team has to accomplish in its third game to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 ARGENTINA: Already through to the next round, the Argentines can take it easy 
against the Bulgarians in Dallas on Thursday, perhaps using the game to give 
some other players World Cup experience. A tie would be enough to give them 
first place in Group D, something they might achieve even if they lose. 
</P>
<P>
 BELGIUM: Saturday's victory over the Dutch gives the Belgians a little 
breathing room too. They have qualified for the second round and can win Group 
F with a tie against Saudi Arabia in Washington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 BOLIVIA: The luckless Bolivians will be making an early exit from their first 
World Cup in 44 years after back-to-back losses. To have even a slight chance 
of survival, they have to beat Spain in Chicago on Monday, but with their key 
players suspended, they have little hope of doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 BRAZIL: The samba beat continues and will grow louder as the tournament 
progresses. Having already earned a second-round berth, the Brazilians simply 
will be looking to fine-tune their engine when they play Sweden in the Pontiac 
Silverdome on Tuesday. A tie would clinch first place in Group B. 
</P>
<P>
 BULGARIA: Beaten by the Nigerians, Bulgaria has a chance to make it through to 
the next stage but will have to defeat Greece in Chicago today and hope for a 
positive result against Argentina in Dallas on Thursday to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 CAMEROON: The loss to Brazil put a big dent in the African team's hopes, but 
Roger Milla and friends can make it to the second round with a victory over 
Russia in Palo Alto on Tuesday. A loss or a tie would mean elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 COLOMBIA: The biggest disappointment of the tournament has one last chance to 
salvage something from the wreckage when it plays Switzerland today in Palo 
Alto. Anything less than victory by a sizable margin will condemn the South 
Americans to the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
 GERMANY: Coach Berti Vogts' squad is poised to win Group C but can only assure 
itself of that by defeating South Korea in Dallas on Monday. A tie should be 
enough to take the group title unless Spain beats Bolivia by more than two 
goals in Chicago that same afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 GREECE: As World Cup debut appearances go, this one has been a disaster so 
far. Things do not figure to get any better today against Bulgaria in Chicago 
or on Thursday against Nigeria in Foxboro, Mass. The Greeks will be on their 
way home by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 IRELAND: Group E, the so-called "group of death," could slay any of its four 
members. The Irish cannot rely on a tie against Norway at Giants Stadium on 
Tuesday getting them through. They have to go for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 ITALY: Like Ireland, Italy needs to defeat Mexico in Washington on Tuesday to 
be certain of staying in the tournament. The group's complicated scenario means 
the score of each game is equally important as the result. In other words, a 
tie might not be enough to put the Italians through. 
</P>
<P>
 MEXICO: The Mexicans, as do the other teams in Group E, have a goal difference 
of zero, meaning they have scored as many goals as they have yielded. But 
because Mexico and Ireland have each scored twice compared to Italy's and 
Norway's once, they have a slight mathematical advantage. A victory over Italy 
in Washington would be the best way to resolve the puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 MOROCCO: Two games, two losses and a minus-two goal difference has left the 
Moroccans on the verge of elimination. The Dutch should push them over the edge 
in Orlando on Wednesday. The Moroccans must win big, but they don't have the 
guns to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 NETHERLANDS: The Dutch need to get at least a point against the Moroccans but 
will be going for all three after being shut out by Belgium on Saturday. A big 
win and a Belgian loss to Saudi Arabia on the same day would give Holland the 
Group F title. 
</P>
<P>
 NIGERIA: The adventurous and entertaining Nigerians need only a tie in their 
final first-round game, against Greece in Foxboro on Thursday, to clinch second 
place in Group D. A victory, which is more likely, would put them in position 
to win the group if Argentina falters. 
</P>
<P>
 NORWAY: The fourth-place team in Group E could become the first-place team by 
Tuesday night if it defeats Ireland at Giants Stadium. Like Italy, a tie might 
not be enough to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 ROMANIA: Which Romanian team shows up to play the United States this afternoon 
at the Rose Bowl will determine if Gheorghe Hagi and company finish first, 
second, third or even fourth in Group A. Romania defeated Colombia and then 
fell to Switzerland. Is it time for the tie that would assure both teams of 
advancing? 
</P>
<P>
 RUSSIA: An early flight back to Moscow and a cold reception there, even in the 
middle of summer, awaits the Russians if they do not defeat Cameroon in Palo 
Alto on Tuesday. A tie does them no good; they must win. 
</P>
<P>
 SAUDI ARABIA: Boosted by their first World Cup victory, over Morocco on 
Saturday, the Saudis have a chance to make the second round as one of the 
third-place teams, even if they lose. A tie against the Belgians in Washington 
on Wednesday should be good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH KOREA: The South Koreans have played as hard as they know how and still 
face elimination unless they can somehow score what would be one of the World 
Cup's great upsets by beating Germany in Dallas on Monday. Don't hold your 
breath. A tie, however, is not beyond the realm of possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 SPAIN: Victory over the Bolivians in Chicago on Monday would guarantee Spain 
at least second place in Group C and, if Germany is tied by or loses to South 
Korea, the Spanish would win the group. A loss would eliminate Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 SWEDEN: The Swedes' final first-round game is against Brazil, their opponent 
in the 1958 World Cup final. Sweden is virtually certain of qualifying and this 
will be a test to see just how strong it is. First and second place in Group B 
are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 SWITZERLAND: A victory over Colombia in Palo Alto this afternoon could give 
the Swiss the Group A title. A tie would clinch second place. A loss would 
leave the Swiss no worse than third and probably still second. In other words, 
there is no pressure on Coach Roy Hodgson's team. 
</P>
<P>
 UNITED STATES: This is it. Today's game against Romania could put the United 
States in the second round for the first time since 1930. A victory or a tie at 
the Rose Bowl guarantees that. A loss will not be fatal because of the four 
points already won. There should be celebrations in Pasadena by 3 p.m. because 
a third-place team with four points should go to the next round. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is where the fun really begins.

JIM MURRAY: AROUND THE WORLD IN 18 HOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golf is not just a game, it's, like music, a universal language. Go anywhere 
in the world in a crowded room and just murmur the name Hogan and see what 
happens. Shortly a guy in a turban will bound up to you and begin to shout "The 
Hawk! Carnoustie, 1953! Tell me, did you know the great Hogan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Haul a bag of golf clubs off an airport carousel anywhere from Karachi to 
Tierra del Fuego and a porter probably will ask if you like the overlapping 
grip or the interlocking. In Japan, a young woman who looks like something out 
of "Madame Butterfly" will tell you, "It's 143 to the front of the green and 
153 to the pin. There's a one-club wind against you." 
</P>
<P>
 If I didn't already know this, I would have found it out from a new book 
written by two pals of mine, Tom Callahan and Dave Kindred. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys are the real Dream Team, because they just returned from a round of 
golf that took 69 days with a greens fee of $70,000 on a mythical course that's 
7,266 yards -- or 37,319 miles -- from tee to green, depending on how you look 
at it. If you thought Trent Jones' courses were long from one green to the next 
tee, how about crossing the Pacific Ocean to go from the 15th hole, in Japan, 
to the 16th tee, in Pebble Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 This twosome, this ultimate odd couple, took flight from taking the garbage 
out and washing the car to go on a junket to play golf in all the exotic places 
around the globe. They constructed a conglomerate 18 holes that they dubbed the 
Royal & Diabolical Global Golf Club. It was the ultimate $2 Nassau and it began 
in Portrush, Northern Ireland, where their host landed in Crumlin Road Jail for 
supplying arms to terrorists and blowing up his own hotel.  
</P>
<P>
 The charm of their book, "Around the World In 18 Holes," is that it's not just 
a "And then I cut a little five-iron round the dogleg and two-putted to go 
one-up" type of recital. These guys actually looked out the bus window. Golf 
was just their entree. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they got the publisher, Doubleday, to pay their greens fee -- 
considerable when you realize that getting from one green to the next tee 
sometimes involved the kind of flights even Amelia Earhart couldn't survive. 
</P>
<P>
 They teed it up in Iceland, where out-of-bounds on the left was the Arctic 
Ocean; they putted alongside crocodile tears in Africa. They went up to the rim 
of the world, Katmandu, where your frame of reference for the tee shot was the 
tip of Mt. Everest, and they played the ultimate capitalist's game in the 
shadow of the Kremlin in Moscow on a course where a 90 could win you the club 
championship. They played some Asian courses where the main hazards weren't 
sand and water but the prospect of sniper fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, they remind you, an Indiana Jones adventure. But it was also Walter 
Mitty. They got to play the cradle of golf, St. Andrews, and they note that 
golf courses are 18 holes only because this one happened to be. 
</P>
<P>
 How about taking the Orient Express from one hole to another? The definitive 
golf cart. That famous train of traveling intrigue where Agatha Christie's 
characters confounded the Surete with their nefarious carryings-on. Neither of 
our world travelers ran into Hercule Poirot, but they notice the train was 
impressively right on time -- which is more than can be said for author 
Callahan.  
</P>
<P>
 Moscow, they noted, had made the transition from communism to capitalism 
easily and in a formulaic manner. Which is to say the city had gone from the 
KGB to the Capone gang. Either way, the machine guns ruled it. Only now they 
were in the hands of free-lance gangsters, not the government-sponsored ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has one-fifth of the Earth's land surface but had no golf courses. The 
Russian Open is light years away. The golf was not as memorable as the rest of 
the New Russia, which needs Eliot Ness more than Thomas Jefferson (or Jack 
Nicklaus) at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency, of course, became a problem. In one alms box in India, Kindred 
stuffed all of the twosome's money. "It's either $8,000 or 16 cents. I'm not 
sure," he told his partner.  
</P>
<P>
 Travel was broadening. Kindred alludes to the crapshoot of buying a ticket on 
India's internal airlines, where in the previous four months they had had four 
hijacks and two major crashes, killing 75. Callahan was intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "A crash might put a damper on the trip," he acknowledged. "But a hijacking 
could be interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thailand, the golf carts were elephants. In Calcutta, they played on the 
world's oldest course outside the British Isles, founded in 1829, thus beating 
Palm Springs' first course by a century and a week.  
</P>
<P>
 The two are not so jaded that they couldn't look out the window over their 
sterling silver tea sets and see the squalor outside. Calcutta, you conclude, 
must be Punjabi for despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopelessness has a smell in Calcutta," they write. "The smell of urine, 
excrement, exhaust fumes and food so rancid it burns your nostrils, food dumped 
onto babies' garbage piles on Calcutta's sidewalks, left there for weeks, 
buzzing with flies, picked over by vultures who dare little babies to put a 
hand toward their discoveries." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Callahan adds, "Typically, we deplored the poverty of Calcutta from the 
comfort of the Taj Bengal hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 The authors play a kind of literary Scotch foursome in which they play 
alternate shots -- chapters -- so that it's sometimes difficult to know who's 
talking.  
</P>
<P>
 But they have this revelatory glimpse of Singapore that was penned pre-caning: 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU back in the States would be wigged out," the American (resident in 
Singapore) said. "But the hell with them and the white horse they rode in on. 
You can walk the streets of Singapore any hour of the day or night without 
thinking somebody is going to put a knife in your ribs. I like that more than 
protecting creeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no drug problem here and everybody works, either privately or in 
government programs, so there's no homeless problem, no beggars on the street. 
The place has the highest per-capita income in Southeast Asia. It's an 
experiment that's working." 
</P>
<P>
 They made 32 takeoffs, they note, but, more important, they made 32 landings. 
They took more than nine-irons and three-woods with them. They took their 
reporters' eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect if you ask the average globe-trotting pro what Calcutta was like, 
he'd screw up his forehead and say, "Well, the second hole doglegs left, but 
you better hit an iron off the tee and lay up the second too. The fourth green, 
the putt breaks three feet left. In Katmandu, your frame of reference is that 
big hill there, I forget what it's called." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, a pro golfer never leaves home. But 14-handicappers take time to 
smell the roses. Or, in some cases, Calcutta.

ANGELS CAPITALIZE ON BREAK; BASEBALL: BAD HOP PROVIDES BREAKTHROUGH IN 12-7 
COMEBACK VICTORY OVER RANGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The crowd groaned the moment it left Chili Davis' bat in the eighth inning 
Saturday night. It was a routine double-play ball. It appeared that it not only 
would end the Angels' inning, but cost them another game. 
</P>
<P>
 While everyone dreaded the inevitable, Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina sat 
calmly in the dugout, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This field may look beautiful," DiSarcina said after the Angels' 12-7 victory 
over the Texas Rangers at Anaheim Stadium, "but once you're on it, it can get 
pretty ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 The ball bounced once . . . twice . . . and just when Texas shortstop Esteban 
Beltre waited for the ball to reach his glove . . . the ball bounced wildly 
over his head into left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most beautfiful hop I've ever seen," Angel third baseman Spike 
Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad hop not only produced two runs, enabling the Angels to overcome a 7-5 
deficit, but triggered a seven-run inning that allowed them to win for only the 
second time in six games. Russ Springer (2-1) pitched the final two innings for 
the victory; Cris Carpenter (2-5) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (32-43) moved to within 2 1/2 games of the Rangers in the American 
League West with the victory and left Texas Manager Kevin Kennedy screaming 
into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what happened," Kennedy said. "Each loss is tougher to take 
than the one before. I can't even describe the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt like this before, for this long, in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, don't look to Davis for sympathy, who claims that Kennedy got what he 
deserved. Kennedy made the mistake of intentionally walking Tim Salmon to get 
to Davis, and Davis made him pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love beating up on Kevin Kennedy," Davis said. "He disrespected me. I take 
it personally when somebody walks somebody to get to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, you're going to walk somebody to get to me? 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as he did it, I saw him look up and pray, and say, 'Please, make it 
work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The bad hop gave the Angels an 8-7 lead, and by the time the inning ended, 
Beltre committed a throwing error, Greg Myers had his second hit of the inning, 
and J.T. Snow had a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight's game sort of reminded me of the (April 15) Toronto game," DiSarcina 
said, "in which we came back (with seven runs) in the night. No one wanted to 
be the one to make the last out. The enthusiasm on the bench was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 It was this enthusiasm, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann said, that had been 
missing this last week. It is why he decided to play left fielder Rex Hudler 
and second baseman Harold Reynolds, benching Chad Curtis and Damion Easley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to get a little more life," Lachemann said, "get a little 
more energy into the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann's best move, however, was taking a bit of advice from childhood pal 
Sparky Anderson, manager of the Detroit Tigers. Anderson told him that he might 
not be best utilizing Bo Jackson's talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'When you've got a guy like that, you got to get one chance to 
use him,' " Lachemann said. "This was our chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had runners on first and third with one out when Jackson was 
summoned. Kennedy countered with Carpenter, who got ahead with two quick 
strikes. But on a 1-2 pitch, Jackson bounced a ball into the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to tell the repercussions it will have on the Angels. They want 
to believe it will be the play that turns around their season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have that confidence, that arrogance that a lot of teams have," 
DiSarcina said, "and we have to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this will be the thing that does it.

WIMBLEDON / WOMEN; U.S. PAIR CLOSING IN ON HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They grew up together in Houston, played together at little MacGregor Park and 
now are moving up together at Wimbledon. Along the way, Americans Lori McNeil 
and Zina Garrison-Jackson also are on the verge of doing something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Making history together. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women have reached the women's singles round of 16, with Garrison-Jackson 
advancing to the fourth round Saturday with a 6-2, 4-1 victory against Italy's 
Laura Golarsa, who was forced to retire because of an injured shoulder. A day 
earlier, McNeil beat Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 With their victories, McNeil, who earlier upset No. 1-ranked Steffi Graf, and 
Garrison-Jackson are one match away from becoming the first two 
African-American women to both reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with American Bryan Shelton, the qualifier who stunned second-seeded 
Michael Stich of Germany in the opening round, the three players have attracted 
the kind of attention not often paid to African-American touring pros. Like it 
or not, they have become centerpieces for minorities in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's long overdue," said Garrison-Jackson of the renewed interest. 
"And if it will help other people, I don't mind. I think something needs to 
happen in tennis, because we're not getting the players' interest. This might 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 It can't hurt, especially when Sports Illustrated is using its magazine cover 
to ask, 'Is Tennis Dying?'  
</P>
<P>
 Garrison-Jackson oversees a tennis program in Houston that is in desperate 
need of a major sponsor. At last check, 484 young players, many of them 
minorities, were enrolled in the innovative program. Another 200 are on the 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison-Jackson, as well as other players, do what they can, but it would 
help if corporate America sent a check. Or better yet, suggested 
Garrison-Jackson, if the U.S. Tennis Assn. became more involved. 
</P>
<P>
 USTA officials say they are involved. They point to a variety of inner-city 
tennis programs that are beginning to pay dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the problem is the general failure of tennis to attract 
minorities into the mainstream. All too often, McNeil said, tennis becomes the 
fourth or fifth choice behind other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not exactly sure how you would improve it," she said. "I think my 
exposure (and) minorities being exposed to tennis is very important. They have 
to see it. It has to be available to them and I think (this week's victories by 
McNeil, Garrison-Jackson and Shelton) are a start. Beyond that, I'm not so 
sure. I think Bryan's a great role model and I think when any of us do well, 
it's pretty inspiring -- I think for the Americans, as well as minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think it's just making tennis available and exposing them at an earlier 
age, especially boys, because I guess they have a lot of other sports. 
Basketball and football seem to be pretty big. . . . Shaquille O'Neal and 
Michael Jordan. Everyone wants to be Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 By next Sunday, more kids might want to be like McNeil or Garrison-Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil will play unseeded Florencia Labat of Argentina in Monday's round of 
16. A victory there would leave McNeil, who has reached the quarterfinals only 
once in 10 previous Wimbledon visits, with a match against either No. 14 Amanda 
Coetzer of South Africa or Larisa Neiland of Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison-Jackson, who reached the final here in 1990, plays in the lower half 
of the draw and will meet a much tougher fourth round opponent -- No. 2 Arantxa 
Sanchez Vicario of Spain. Sanchez Vicario hasn't been extended to a third set 
and has lost only nine of 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the remainder of the draw, almost all attention is focused on No. 4 
Martina Navratilova, whose serve-and-volley game make her the logical, if not 
sentimental, favorite to win a 10th Wimbledon singles title. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova needed only 59 minutes on Centre Court Saturday to defeat Linda 
Harvey-Wild, 6-3, 6-2. Next for the 37-year-old Navratilova: No. 17 Helena 
Sukova of the Czech Republic -- formerly Czechoslovakia, Navratilova's native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big link there," Navratilova said. "There's a lot of baggage 
happening when I play her. That's another tricky one. I'll have to keep playing 
the ball and not get into the past, because it's easy to get overwhelmed by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Lindsay Davenport, who recently graduated from Murrieta Valley High in 
Riverside County, has a different sort of problem: not to get overwhelmed by 
the thought of facing the more experienced Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, who 
is seeded 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini nearly won the singles championship in 1991. With Graf gone, Sabatini 
has as good as chance as anyone this time around.

LEAP OF FATE; FORMER JAVELIN CHAMPION SCHMIDT GETS AN EARLY START ON BATTLE 
AGAINST OVARIAN CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a random, isolated, freakish leap forward in the early detection of ovarian 
cancer, a dog bound into Kate Schmidt's lap last summer and became woman's best 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 More than likely because of Bubba, a mutt of indistinguishable pedigree, 
Schmidt's is a story of recovery, not an obituary. 
</P>
<P>
 In too many cases, ovarian cancer takes no prisoners. It is neither star 
struck nor judgmental. It devoured comedienne Gilda Radner without remorse and 
had Schmidt in its cross hairs -- germ cells multiplying at hideous rates -- as 
it swelled into a tumor the size of a honeydew melon. As with the others, 
cancer did not pause to consider its victim, in this case Schmidt, a two-time 
Olympic javelin bronze medalist and holder of the American women's record at 
227 feet 5 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes in life you need luck, plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt was camping with friends in the Sequoias when Bubba, whom she had 
rescued from the pound, returned the favor when he took the garden variety 
dog's leap into her lap.  
</P>
<P>
 One of his paws hit a sore spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a very bad pain," Schmidt remembers. "But it was just in the wrong 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon her return home to Los Angeles, Schmidt phoned a general practitioner. 
Two days later, Aug. 7, she was being prepped for surgery at Good Samaritan 
Hospital, where she would remain for 21 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends such as Mike Tully, Dan Ripley, Debbie Brill, Maren Seidler, Cindy 
Gilbert, Patty Van Wolvelaere kept her company. 
</P>
<P>
 They came as Schmidt's hair fell out in clumps during four, week-long sessions 
of chemotherapy. In a friend's back yard, Schmidt ordered that her head be 
shaved as she wondered, jokingly, whether anyone would notice with the 
appropriate application of earrings and makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 When she felt too ill to attend her induction into Long Beach State's Hall of 
Fame, her father, E.V., stepped up to pinch-hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Others rallied to defray medical costs. Schmidt was changing medical insurance 
companies at the time of her surgery and was not covered. She will probably be 
paying off the balance -- estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- 
for the rest of her life, maybe beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 As if cancer weren't enough to lose sleep over. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than accept the 
</P>
<P>
 disease as a vehicle of death, however, she has found daily affirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really got afraid," says the 40-year-old Schmidt, her cancer now in 
remission. "I never really felt it was life-threatening. But it put all the 
good stuff in a little better focus. It reminded me how great everything really 
is. I'd never taken for granted how great it was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big fan of my own life. It just reminded me, in the back of my head. I 
have that little voice, waiting for the other shoe to drop. When is the 
recurrence going to happen? You try not to pay attention or listen to it, but 
it's there. That's probably what enables everything to crystallize. A pretty 
day is way prettier than it ever was. And a happy dog is way happier than it 
ever was." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt considers herself blessed. Initially, she was told she would need six 
chemotherapy sessions -- "I can't describe what it feels to wake up in a pool 
of chemo to anybody other than someone who has gone through it" -- but needed 
only four treatments to knock the cancer out for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she knows this isn't measles. According to American Cancer Society 
figures, the five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is 39%. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt is unaware of that particular statistic and does not wish to be overly 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at numbers," she says. "I feel like I don't have cancer anymore. 
That's how I want to live my life. I want to stay in touch, I don't want to 
slip into some sort of fog of denial about it, but I want to feel as good as I 
can feel every day." 
</P>
<P>
 She is slowly regaining the energy that once made her a vibrant figure in 
track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 Always a free spirit, Schmidt never accepted coaching. She was a natural-born 
"slinger" who shunned conventional technique. 
</P>
<P>
 She once had the five longest American javelin tosses. Her throw of 227-5, at 
the time a world record, is the longest-standing American track and field mark 
in the books. 
</P>
<P>
 She made her mark Sept. 11, 1977, at Furth, West Germany, and will be 
remembered as much for the post-record party rampage through town, during which 
she left few beer steins unturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt's lust for life and intellectual curiosity, along with her trademark 
pink '63 Rambler American, would steer her into an interesting coterie of 
friends, among them screenwriter Robert Towne ("Chinatown,") and Sergio 
Premoli, an Italian playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer or no, Schmidt has lost little of that vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 She is recouping hair follicles and has regained most of the 30 pounds she 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 After two months away from work, she is back into her career as a certified 
personal trainer, specializing in post-surgical aquatics rehabilitation -- a 
business she started in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 7, she quietly -- and gingerly -- completed a 5-kilometer race, a fund 
raiser for UCLA's women's breast and ovarian cancer research program. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the nine-month anniversary of her surgery, performed by Richard 
Nalick -- a former javelin thrower at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right away, I knew I was OK," Schmidt says. "After I heard that, nothing else 
mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a dog's timely leap, Schmidt and her doctors are optimistic about 
her prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no test for it," Schmidt says. "It's not detectable. It's usually 
not found until the third and fourth stage. Mine was found in the first stage, 
with possible third stage because the tumor had ruptured. Sort of cancer on the 
loose. That's why I had the chemotherapy. But the tumor was first stage, so 
it's really treatable." 
</P>
<P>
 For the detection, Schmidt thanks not a doctor, but a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Bubba not taken his fateful leap? 
</P>
<P>
 "The tumor would have kept growing," she says. "And it was growing very fast. 
Bubba saved my life, because I saved his at the pound." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt attends weekly meetings at the Wellness Community in Pasadena, where 
she shares her secrets with other cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's changed my life only for the better," she says of her ordeal. "Cancer 
has a horrible reputation, and I'll be the first to admit it's a crappy 
disease, but it's so much more manageable now than it ever was before." 
</P>
<P>
 Every now and then, though, darkness overpowers optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a friend from the Wellness Community had a recurrence of her ovarian 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our surgeries the same time," Schmidt says. "And it's very serious. 
That's frightening to me. It's a very close-to-home reminder, how fast it can 
get you. She had a perfectly good blood test two months ago. Now, it doesn't 
look good." 
</P>
<P>
 Down cycles are to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't make sense if I didn't have periods like that anyway, whether 
it's about cancer or about life," Schmidt says. "None of the good stuff is 
worth anything unless there's the fear and the anger and everything else that 
we have to overcome constantly. That's what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dramatic stories are the ones that make the news more often than the 
happy endings in this. I wouldn't mind being one to say it's survivable."

HE'S MR. CONSISTENCY; BLUE JAYS' JOE CARTER IS NOT FLASHY -- HE SIMPLY DRIVES 
IN RUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has driven in so many runs, delivered so many clutch hits, that he simply 
visualizes it happening again when the situation arises, sees himself 
responding. 
</P>
<P>
 But although he clearly is baseball's leading run producer of the last decade, 
with totals for the last eight years virtually unmatched in any era, it is as 
if the Toronto Blue Jay right fielder is taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 It is as if he is thought of only as an often-traded player, having gone from 
the Chicago Cubs to the Cleveland Indians to the San Diego Padres, then finally 
to Toronto, which he expects to be his final stop. At 34, he plans to retire 
when his contract expires after the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a larger-than-life mural on the side of a building in Toronto showing 
Carter, with the time and date, hitting the three-run, ninth-inning homer that 
lifted the Blue Jays to an 8-6 victory, and the championship, over the 
Philadelphia Phillies in Game 6 of last year's World Series. But it might take 
Hall of Fame validation before Carter's career is portrayed in proper 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, despite a major league record 31 runs batted in during April, Carter 
is only a footnote to the offensive onslaught of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that people haven't been able to appreciate who Joe Carter 
is and what he's accomplished," teammate Dave Stewart said. "He's as solid a 
professional as you're going to get, and he's got to be the premier run 
producer during his time in the big leagues. If there's a guy on second base, 
he's going to find a way to get him in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe's problem, if you want to call it that, is that he's not flaky or flashy 
and doesn't toot his own horn. He's also played in places that didn't get a lot 
of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when the Blue Jays have played in the World Series, someone has stolen 
the spotlight. It was Roberto Alomar in the playoffs and Pat Borders in the 
World Series two years ago. I was the MVP of the playoffs last year, and people 
seem to remember Paul Molitor as the star of the World Series despite Joe's 
homer." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, Carter says. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Diana, and their three children know who he is and what he has 
accomplished. So do his 10 brothers and sisters, his 38 -- at last count -- 
nieces and nephews, all of whom live in Oklahoma City. The family doesn't have 
to be reminded of what he has done, what he has become. His mother, Athelene, 
often has to caution her other children to "call Joe to talk, to say hello, not 
just when you need a bill paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter says he can't control the media and couldn't care less about headlines 
or the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers my family more than it bothers me," he said of the relative lack 
of recognition. "It's not why I play the game. We have a fraternity of 
ballplayers, and all I care about is what my peers think. I feel I've earned 
their respect and feel I have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, I enjoy my privacy, and anything more would take away from it. I 
like to go into a restaurant without being hassled. I enjoy taking a walk or 
riding my bike without being recognized. The (World Series) home run raised my 
recognition level about 50%, particularly in Kansas City (where he lives in the 
off-season), but it didn't change me personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it brought out the little boy in me at the time, but my greatest joy 
is seeing 
</P>
<P>
 and hearing the emotions other people express when they talk about their 
reaction to my reaction, seeing me laughing and jumping around the bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter appeared on the Arsenio Hall show last winter but otherwise turned down 
appearance and endorsement opportunities that would have increased his 
visibility but intruded on his privacy. He had hit 33 homers and 33 doubles 
during the season, finishing third in the American League with 121 RBIs, but he 
was only 12th in the most-valuable-player voting, only fourth among the Blue 
Jays behind Molitor, John Olerud and Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken for granted? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carter began the 1994 season with 893 RBIs, 247 homers and 162 stolen bases 
over the previous eight seasons. Only Willie Mays and Hank Aaron ever averaged 
30 homers, 100 RBIs and 20 steals over an eight-year span. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His major league-leading RBI total for those eight years is the highest 
since Aaron had 884 and Frank Robinson 828 from 1961 through 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He drove in 100 or more runs in each of the eight years except 1988, when 
he had 98. He has driven in 115 or more four times, 120 or more twice. He has 
also hit 30 or more homers five times, 24 or more eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is the only player to have driven in 100 or more runs in three 
consecutive seasons with three teams, starting in 1989 with Cleveland, then San 
Diego, then Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He also has played the full 162 games four times in the last six seasons 
and 155 or more six times in the last eight. He sat out only 29 games in the 
eight seasons -- 13 of those in 1987 when he suffered a broken nose when hit by 
a pitch -- and he has enhanced that reputation this season, setting his April 
RBI record despite a broken thumb. He did sit out three games in early May 
after experiencing dizziness and collapsing at home because of a condition 
diagnosed as vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was spinning and suddenly I was on the floor," he said. "It was 
frightening, the kind of thing that puts baseball in perspective. I still have 
trouble focusing at times, and it still feels a little weird when I run, but I 
try to play through everything, even though I don't feel as if I've slept in a 
month, my eyes are so heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have a football mentality. I played in high school with a broken 
kneecap, a broken nose and a broken hand, though not all at the same time. 
Anybody can play when they're healthy. It takes something special to play when 
you're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter is batting .284 -- 22 points higher than his lifetime average -- with 
16 doubles, 16 homers, a .553 slugging percentage and 67 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I put on the uniform I'm having fun," he said. "Every time I get a 
hit it's a new experience. Every year I feel I can improve on the previous 
year. I've never put limits on what I felt I was capable of achieving. I 
believe in shooting for the moon. If I miss, I'm still among the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 More than at Cleveland and San Diego, he is among the stars in Toronto, where 
he bats behind Devon White, Alomar and Molitor, who have a combined on-base 
percentage of almost .400 and the speed to score from first base on extra-base 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys, like myself, see a runner in scoring position and try to get a 
base hit," Molitor said. "Others are always trying to hit a three-run homer. 
Joe will get the base hit, but he will also jump on a mistake and hit a 
three-run homer. He can hurt you both ways. He's amazingly consistent. A lot of 
guys knock in a hundred runs once or twice, but he's the only guy knocking in 
115 or 120 every year." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 3 and 215 pounds, with the speed that had accounted for as many as 
31 steals in a season starting to tail off now -- he had eight steals last year 
and has five so far this season -- Carter said he considers himself a 
line-drive hitter capable of hitting home runs. He holds the American League 
record for most games with three home runs, five, but said he considers a 30- 
or 40-home-run season meaningful only if his 500 or so other at-bats have been 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Rob Deer," he said of the former major leaguer now playing in Japan, 
whose repertoire at the plate consisted mostly of home runs and strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistency, Carter said, is his key. He has not gone more than six games this 
season without an RBI and is on a pace that projects to 153. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there so often now that I can visualize the home run I hit in the 
World Series or the other hits I've had in clutch situations," Carter said. 
"It's like tunnel vision. I have a clear picture of what I need to do because 
I've done it so often before. That's confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a matter of not trying to do too much. Carter started this season 
with 40 sacrifice flies in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 He has done it with good teams and bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I consider the caliber of people I was traded for," he said. "I 
went to the Indians for a guy (Rick Sutcliffe) who won a Cy Young (award) with 
the Cubs. I went to the Padres for one of the best catchers in baseball (Sandy 
Alomar) and a guy (Carlos Baerga) who had one of the all-time years for a 
second baseman (last season). The Blue Jays traded Fred McGriff and Tony 
Fernandez for me and Roberto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not exactly chopped liver. I mean, it's supply and demand. One team may have 
felt they could get rid of me, but I was always in demand elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Toronto General Manager Pat Gillick: "He's the total package, on and off 
the field. I hate to be trite, but it's not just his playing ability. He's a 
leader in the clubhouse as well. We definitely knew what kind of person he 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Stewart: "Joe basically leads by example, but when things get critical, 
he can become vocal. He's definitely a rock in the clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Definitely Hall of Fame material. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's out of my control," Carter said. "All I can do is put the numbers up 
and let them speak for themselves. If I'm elected, it would be a great honor. 
If not, it won't be because I didn't have a great career. I think I have, and I 
still have 2 1/2 years left."

<P>
 O.J. Simpson could be going on trial for his life. Did he commit murder? 
Twice? I don't know. Neither do you. You know O.J. did it? No, you don't. You 
know O.J. could never do such a thing? No, you don't. You know nothing. You 
knew the victims? You knew Nicole's relationship with O.J.? You knew Nicole's 
relationship with Ron Goldman? No, you don't. You know nothing. You think you 
know something you should share with everyone. You don't. 
</P>
<P>
 So, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop talking to talk shows. Stop giving interviews. Stop giving opinions. 
Don't do it for money. Don't do it for free. Yes, we do have free speech in 
this country. Yes, I do do interviews for a living myself. But this is a murder 
case. This is not Amy Fisher and it is not Tonya Harding and it is not Lorena 
Bobbitt. This is homicide. Two people are dead and a popular man's life is at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You work with the police? You have seen the evidence? You searched for the 
evidence? You were a law-enforcement negotiator? You might testify for the 
prosecution? Your knowledge might aid the district attorney? You work in the 
jail where Simpson is being held? You visited him personally? Then tell it to a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You work as a licensed therapist? You treated Nicole Brown Simpson as a 
patient? You heard her innermost thoughts confidentially? You don't feel her 
trust is being violated now that she is gone? You know something of her 
relationship with her former husband that might be pertinent in a courtroom? 
Then save it for the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You host a TV or radio show? You believe this case sheds new light on domestic 
abuse? You have heard or read the "911" emergency phone-call transcriptions, so 
you know what was happening between these two individuals? Every word they 
spoke is self-explanatory? You absolutely know what was happening behind those 
closed doors? Like hell you do. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You were related to one of the two found savagely murdered in Los Angeles on 
the evening of June 12, 1994? You were a witness who happened to spot someone 
or something that night? You drove a limo or rode an airplane or worked at a 
Chicago hotel or drove by a field and noticed a man who resembled the suspect? 
Talk to a cop, not to a talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You dated O.J. Simpson and he never laid a hand on you in anger? You 
befriended O.J. Simpson as a child or as an adult and you know he could never 
deliberately hurt a soul? You were a business acquaintance of O.J. Simpson's or 
knew him in school or met him once upon a time? Then be his friend. Keep out of 
this. Wait to speak until it is over. Don't blurt anything that could be 
damaging to either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You got a call from Connie Chung, from Diane Sawyer, from Barbara Walters, 
from Joan Lunden, from Geraldo Rivera, from Ted Koppel, from this program, from 
that program, from someone who wants to know what you have to say about all 
this? Say nothing. Stop reflexively linking spousal abuse to violent death 
until the outcome of this case is resolved. Stop saying, "See what jealously 
can lead to?" The man is pleading innocent, not guilty. There has been no 
confession, no conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to help. You want to tell your side. You hate what you already have 
heard. You want to clarify certain points. You want people to know the real 
Nicole, the real Ron, the real O.J. Then tell us once this case is resolved, 
now now. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 You are a writer. You keep making football references, references to Simpson's 
former livelihood, references you believe to be appropriate or ironic. O.J. on 
the run. O.J. outrunning his pursuit. O.J. now facing the biggest game of his 
life. This isn't clever. This isn't funny. This isn't necessary. You only think 
you are clever. You are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson could be on trial for his life. Did he commit murder? Twice? I 
don't know. Neither do you. If he is innocent, he might need to live among us 
again. If he is guilty, he might deserve to die himself. This is literally life 
or death. This is too urgent to indulge your self-importance. This is no time 
to venture a guess, jump to a conclusion, state an assumption, betray a 
confidence or swear on a television program what you should only be swearing on 
a Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 So, please. Please .

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; PREUD'HOMME HAD THE FEELING, SO DUTCH GET 
BURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 89 minutes he had held them at bay, flinging his body this way and that, 
expending every ounce of energy and courage in a valiant effort to keep the 
Netherlands off the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Dutch were moving in on him again, weaving their mesmerizing 
patterns in front of the net, stringing together an intricate series of passes 
until everything seemed an orange blur. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise from the Florida Citrus Bowl crowd of 62,387 had built to a 
crescendo when out of the haze and the heat one final shot flew off the boot of 
Dutch winger Marc Overmars. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Preud'homme took to the air one last time, launching himself toward the 
ball, reaching out and tipping it onto the crossbar, then pouncing on the 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, the final whistle sounded. Belgium had defeated the 
Netherlands, 1-0, and the unquestioned hero of the hour was 35-year-old 
Preud'homme. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, the Belgian goalkeeper just stood there in the penalty area, 
pumping his fists into the air in delight. Then midfielder Enzo Scifo raced 
down the field and leaped into his arms. The rest of the Belgian team was not 
far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Dutch goalkeeper Ed De Goey, who had turned in almost as good a 
performance, walked to the center circle to congratulate Preud'homme. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, surrounded by a throng of reporters in the interview room, Preud'homme 
tried to stop grinning, tried to explain why it had all gone so well and tried 
to handle three languages simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching from French to Flemish to English and back again with ease, he 
fielded question after question. 
</P>
<P>
 Why had he played so well? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he replied. "I don't know. It's a bit difficult to explain why 
you play good or bad. You are always working to play good, but you cannot 
explain it." 
</P>
<P>
 What had been the most difficult save?  
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to say," he answered. "Maybe the first free kick and the one 
in the last minute that I hit against the (crossbar)." 
</P>
<P>
 How did he feel about the victory? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not too easy," he said, "but a keeper who can keep the zero is very 
happy and for sure when it means victory for your team." 
</P>
<P>
 When had he realized it was going to be his day? 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually when I wake up in the morning and I get a burning feeling in my ears 
I know I'm going to play well," he said. "I had that feeling this morning. I 
feel I played better than I did against Morocco, but part of my success is a 
good relationship with the other players and I have that, especially with 
Philippe Albert." 
</P>
<P>
 Albert might have scored Belgium's goal, but the defenders who did the most to 
help Preud'homme earn the shutout were team captain and sweeper Georges Grun 
and Michel De Wolf, who time and again robbed the Dutch forwards of the ball at 
the instant they were about to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 What shots did come through, Preud'homme saved. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th minute, he smothered a wickedly curling free kick from Ronald 
Koeman. Three minutes later, he dived to deny Koeman a goal on another 
well-struck free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first half was over, Preud'homme had made another memorable save on 
a shot by Frank Rijkaard and had positioned himself well enough to force Dennis 
Bergkamp to twice shoot inches wide of the post. "He was fantastic," the Dutch 
striker said afterward. "He got three points for Belgium today." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Preud'homme was perhaps even more pumped up than in the 
first. He tipped a looping shot by Jan Wouters over the crossbar, punched out a 
fierce drive by Koeman and flew to his left to make a superb diving save on a 
shot by Bergkamp. All in the first 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bergkamp paused to applaud the latter effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Preud'homme feel pressured? 
</P>
<P>
 "When the team's playing well in front of you, you don't feel much pressure," 
he said. "They were taking the pressure away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Scifo was asked what he thought about his goalkeeper's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Scifo: "He is an extraordinary goalkeeper who we don't want to talk 
about much because we want him to keep playing this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough said.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; HOOLIGANS, SCHMOOLIGANS: PEACE REIGNS IN 
ORLANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 This was to be the hooligan game, Belgium versus the Netherlands. It was to 
be, in the paranoia of World Cup security officials, the day the best of times 
might turn to the worst of times. 
</P>
<P>
 There were so many signs of trouble, so many red flags in this sport of red 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Just the day before, there was a game that matched Mexico and Ireland, both 
of whose fans are volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orlando has a central-city area, called Church Street Station, that looked 
to be a magnet for soccer gang gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dutch have a history of hooligan activity, and they even have a 
national law-enforcement agency called the Central Intelligence of Hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And Belgium, while not home to many hooligans, is also known for its soccer 
fervor and was the ill-fated neutral-site host of the European Cup final on May 
29, 1985, when 39 people died in rioting in the stands of Heysel Stadium more 
than an hour before Liverpool of England was to play Juventus of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened in Orlando? 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night at Church Street Station, the night after Mexico's 2-1 victory 
over Ireland and the eve of Belgium versus Holland, thousands of soccer fans 
showed up. Beer flowed freely. Flags of Ireland, Mexico, Belgium and the 
Netherlands were carried around by singing fans. Traffic jammed. So did 
sidewalks and parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
 And three arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "One was for disorderly intoxication, the other two for trespassing in a bar 
-- two guys wouldn't leave," said Mike Holloway, an Orlando Police Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 What else happened on Church Street? 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Orlando Sentinel, a man waving a Mexican flag verbally baited 
two Ireland rooters. As police braced for the worst, the Irish fans crossed the 
street, approached the Mexican and shook his hand. Later, an Irish fan 
lamenting the loss, told a reporter, "For penance, I'm drinking Mexican beer 
for the rest of the night -- if I can find any." 
</P>
<P>
 And what happened Saturday, when a sellout crowd of 62,387 showed up at the 
Florida Citrus Bowl to watch Belgium beat Holland, 1-0, in a Group F game 
filled with missed chances, close calls and a full 90 minutes of soccer drama? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Late in the game, on a day when temperatures hovered near 100 degrees on 
the field, a Dutch player who had been tossed a cellophane water bag for a 
quick drink, took a sip and handed the rest to a Belgian player. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When it ended, the two goalkeepers, who faced an amazing 37 shots between 
them, met at midfield and embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The thousands of orange-clad Dutch fans and red-clad Belgian fans stayed 
for a long time in the stands, despite the heat. More songs were sung and flags 
were waved before the stadium emptied -- noisily but slowly and safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get through tonight (on Church Street), we'll be home free," 
Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 H.D. Hilin of the Jacksonville Police Department, one of hundreds of 
law-enforcement officers brought in from other cities for the World Cup, said 
at midnight, "There have been no problems tonight (at Church Street Station). 
In fact, the only problems we have had during the entire World Cup time frame 
has been some of the local people, and that hasn't been too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The peace that reigned was because of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The English didn't qualify for the World Cup, leaving their boorish fans 
less inclined to fly across the Pond and wreak havoc with the colonies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The hooligan potential of the Dutch was overrated: "Those type of people 
don't follow the Dutch National Team," said Jaap De Groot, a writer for De 
Telegraaf of Amsterdam. "All our hooligan trouble is with the club teams, and 
our ticket computers have their names and wouldn't allow ticket sales to them." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The security people, including the ever-present Orlando police and Ed 
Best's World Cup security operation, did a good job. Holloway said nine Dutch 
with criminal records ranging from armed robbery to kidnaping were identified 
as they landed in Detroit three days ago and were sent back to Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 For World Cup soccer, the best of times continues.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; IRISH COACH AMONG 8 SUSPENDED BY FIFA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Charlton, Ireland's fiery coach, was suspended Saturday by FIFA for his 
outbursts during Mexico's 1-0 victory over the Irish at Orlando, Fla. on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton will have to sit in the stands for the team's final first-round 
match, Tuesday against Norway in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton and the Irish delegation each were fined $15,000 and forward John 
Aldridge was fined $1,800 for what officials described as ill-mannered 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA also handed out two-game suspensions to goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca of 
Italy for illegally handling a shot and tripping a player during Thursday's 
victory over Norway and Rigobert Song Bahanag of Cameroon, who was ejected 
during Friday's match against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspensions were among eight announced Saturday. The committee also: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Suspended Julio Baldivieso and Luis Cristaldo of Bolivia, Alf Inge Haland 
of Norway, Sergei Gorlukovitch of Russia and Martin Dahlin of Sweden for one 
game after they each received two yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fined the Romanian delegation $15,000 for violating advertising rules by 
allowing a team picture that showed the name of a sponsor on the uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fined Italy, Bulgaria, Nigeria and Spain $3,600 each for other advertising 
infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Porta, chairman of FIFA's disciplinary committee, said Charlton was 
penalized for insulting the referee and a reserve official sitting on the 
sideline near the Irish team. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the heated match, Charlton was seen exchanging words with 
Guillermo Canedo of Mexico, FIFA's senior vice president and chairman of the 
World Cup '94 organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland also will be without defenders Denis Irwin and Terry Phelan, who were 
each banned for one game Saturday after getting their second caution of the 
tournament during Friday's match. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA officials have been frustrated by Charlton's stinging remarks about the 
World Cup, including complaints about inexperienced officials, lack of water on 
the field and the extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton's suspension was the first during a World Cup since 1986, when 
Uruguay's coach was banned for calling the referee "a murderer."

<P>
 Who needs pre-strike sniping between owners and players when you've got: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oakland Manager Tony La Russa sparring with Ruben Sierra and Rickey 
Henderson as the Athletics try to prove that 20 games under .500 puts you in 
the thick of the American League Worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra, who has rebounded from a bad start to have an All-Star season modestly 
worthy of his $24.5-million contract, riled La Russa by wondering publicly what 
had happened to the contending team he was traded to in 1992 -- "This is worse 
than Texas (was)" -- and saying, "I can do my job, but I can't make a team win. 
I can look good, play good, make my numbers, but I can't make the team win. I'm 
only one person." 
</P>
<P>
 Said La Russa: "I don't like it when a guy wants a contract and says, 'I'm the 
big guy, you better sign me,' and then once he gets the contract he is just a 
regular guy. If you have a big contract, you have a big responsibility. I don't 
like it when they say I am only one player, as if they're (journeyman 
infielder) Jeff Schaefer. That doesn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson scratched himself from last Sunday's lineup in Texas, missed an 
additional three games because of an allegedly bad back and disputed La Russa 
on who decides if and when he should be put on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ain't putting me on the DL," Henderson said. "I make the decision. Nobody 
else. Nobody knows my body but me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said La Russa: "If he thinks he decides, he's so full of . . . about reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The manager also suggested Henderson might not be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to be part of a guy being on vacation," La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Jeff Russell defending Manager Butch Hobson, 
who is expected ultimately to be replaced by Montreal coach Tim Johnson or 
Cincinnati coach Bob Boone, and questioning General Manager Dan Duquette's 
knowledge of chemistry. Russell implied in particular that the reeling Red Sox 
haven't been the same since Duquette traded popular Billy Hatcher and Paul 
Quantrill to Philadelphia for Wes Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any chemistry," Russell said. "I know that (Duquette) never 
took a chemistry class. We were OK until the guy in the office started making 
deals. Butch is doing all he can, but it seems like every day we come in here, 
we're looking over our shoulder to see who's going next." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, did he take chemistry or not? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure did," Duquette said. "Nailed the final and aced the course. I'll compare 
my grades to Russell's any day." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bret Saberhagen nursing a tender hamstring and bruised feelings, and 
accusing the New York Mets of "pushing me around" and "screwing me around since 
Day 1" by juggling his starts to diminish his chances of earning incentive 
bonuses based on innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a No. 1 or 2 or 3 guy, I'd think you want him out there as much 
as possible," said Saberhagen, who also joined John Franco in criticizing 
management's failure to improve the team and stop the June slide. "It's getting 
to be the same old mess as last year." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Joe McIlvaine said he felt no obligation to respond, and 
normally tempestuous Manager Dallas Green said only that it's a free country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cincinnati Reds virtually pointing Kevin Mitchell, eligible for free 
agency when the season ends, toward the door by signing Ron Gant to a contract 
that could pay him $3.5 million next year and will pay him $10,000 a game for 
any game he plays this year after he recovers from his broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any games he plays this year is pure bonus," General Manager Jim Bowden said. 
"We got a bargain. It's easier to sign an injured Ron Gant than it is to sign a 
healthy Gant. If we wait until November and he's healthy, a player of his 
caliber will be worth $6 to $9 million on the free-agent market. If we can get 
that player for $3.5 million, it's a wise decision." 
</P>
<P>
 And cheaper than re-signing Mitchell, who would be left without a position in 
an outfield of Gant and the unrelated Sanderses -- Deion and Reggie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the Reds don't want me back," said Mitchell, who already has 
expressed a desire to return to the San Francisco Giants or San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it affect my thinking (on 1995)? Of course. I want to play and be happy, 
but it doesn't discourage me and isn't a problem for me this year. I'm happy 
the man got a job and another chance. I'm happy for Darryl Strawberry as well." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos, while promising to lighten up on 
beleaguered Manager John Oates if the admittedly tense Oates finds a way to 
lighten up, switching his attention to General Manager Roland Hemond and going 
ballistic when he hears Gant has signed with Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't print my reaction," Angelos said. "I thought we were on top of that 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 It is now thought that Angelos will revamp his front office at the end of the 
season by bringing back former club president Larry Lucchino and trying to lure 
Baltimore native John Schuerholz away from the Atlanta Braves to be general 
manager. Hemond, who thought it was more prudent, physically and fiscally, to 
trade for Dwight Smith of the Angels than sign Gant, will reportedly retire, 
giving up the final year of a two-year, $600,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Andre Dawson of the Red Sox throwing the ball at pitcher Todd Stottlemyre 
of the Toronto Blue Jays -- he missed and the ball sailed into center field -- 
after being hit on a two-strike pitch, and Stottlemyre being ejected when he 
hit Dawson again with his first pitch on Dawson's next at-bat. Stottlemyre then 
reacted to the ejection by throwing everything not nailed down in the dugout 
onto the field -- bats, helmets, sunflower seeds and a tub of Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the umpires) are saying is that a hitter can fire anything back at a 
pitcher, but a pitcher can't throw inside," Stottlemyre said. "I mean, I get 
kicked out because they think I was throwing at him, but he stays in even 
though he definitely throws the ball at me. It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the rising temperatures of a hot summer week, Toronto coach Gene Tenace 
laughed and said Stottlemyre probably will be fined $100 for each item he threw 
onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's lucky one of those sunflower seed bags didn't break or it would have 
been even more expensive," Tenace said. IN YOUR FACE 
</P>
<P>
 Will Clark won't say it, but it is a season of vindication for the 30-year-old 
first baseman who got the five-year, $30-million contract from the Texas 
Rangers that he couldn't get from the San Francisco Giants. He has returned the 
following dividends: a .356 average before Saturday's game against the Angels, 
20 doubles, 10 homers and a league-leading 67 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 To this point, said Clark, who appeared in a career-low 132 games last year 
because of knee and groin injuries, it's a most satisfying season. But he 
refuses to measure it against the offensive struggle of the Giants and rub it 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was that way, I'd be talking about it already," he said. "I'm not that 
type person. I'll just let my numbers speak for themselves. I still have a 
bunch of friends there and I wish them well. They have too many good players 
not to get it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, however, said he was surprised by the Giants' signing of Strawberry. In 
the meantime, he said, he had nothing to prove except to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was back to my old standards in September (when he batted .379 to finish at 
.283) and I only wanted to prove I could keep it going," he said. "I came out 
of spring training on the right foot and have been fortunate to sustain it." 
ANTITRUST 
</P>
<P>
 The refusal of the Senate Judiciary Committee to approve a bill that would 
have partially lifted baseball's antitrust exemption and applied antitrust laws 
to the historically troubled labor relations stemmed, chairman Joseph Biden 
(D-Del.) speculated, from "a keen and undefined resentment" in Congress to both 
owners and players and an unwillingness by the legislators to be portrayed 
favoring one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), sponsor of the bill and leader of the attempt 
to remove the exemption, acknowledged after the 10-7 committee rejection 
Thursday that he lacks the votes and doesn't expect the issue to resurface 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a victory for the owners and a defeat for the players, who had thought 
that passage of an antitrust bill might have enabled them to avoid a strike at 
some point after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Given antitrust protection, the union could have decertified, as the NFL 
players union did, and gone to court to challenge the owners' attempt to 
declare an impasse in the negotiations and unilaterally implement a salary-cap 
system. Now, however, a strike remains the union's only leverage against that 
possibility, and the eighth work stoppage since 1972 is almost a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Biden, hitting the nail on the head: "I have found the owners not 
particularly concerned with anything except self-interest, and I think the 
players are right up there with them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * BEEFING UP: Most headlines involving former Dodger Pedro Martinez focus on 
the number of batters he has hit, nine, and the number of brawls in which he 
has been involved, three, as a Montreal Expo. Often overlooked are his 6-3 
record, 2.81 earned-run average, National League-leading strikeout ratio of 9.6 
every nine innings and second-lowest opponents' batting average, .212. 
</P>
<P>
 The 155-pound right-hander has told Manager Felipe Alou that he intends to be 
stronger next year after working with weights during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Alou worried about having a pitcher work with weights?  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me," Alou said. "I think he's concerned about all those 
guys charging him on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
 * FIRING LINE: Chicago White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler reacted to the 
inconsistency of relief ace Roberto Hernandez and 12 losses in 15 games by 
firing bullpen coach Dewey Robinson. Schueler replaced Robinson with triple-A 
pitching coach Rick Peterson, saying Chicago relievers needed a better mental 
approach and that Peterson "knows how to get in their head." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 defeats in 15 games cost Chicago the American League Central lead, but 
Schueler said, "It could happen to any club. It's going to happen to Cleveland. 
They ain't that good. Besides, they haven't proved they can beat us yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox are 3-1 against Cleveland with eight games scheduled for late 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 * POST-MITCH: Since May 30, when Mitch Williams departed, the Houston Astro 
bullpen has made 47 appearances and was unscored on in 39. The bullpen was 3-1 
with six saves in six opportunities, and John Hudek had given up one earned run 
in 10 innings of 10 appearances as the No. 1 man. 
</P>
<P>
 * REVERSAL: After beginning the season 8-1, Bob Tewksbury of the St. Louis 
Cardinals has lost six in a row, giving up 57 hits in 29 1/3 innings. Pitching 
coach Joe Coleman said Tewksbury altered his delivery while battling a recently 
stiff back and hasn't been able to readjust.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; MAGRANE WOULD LOSE BIG IN STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While every player is bracing to sacrifice his paycheck for a potential strike 
this summer, few may be more affected than Angel starter Joe Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane's contract is heavily laden with incentives that not only would cost 
him more than $1 million this season, but drastically reduce his 1995 income. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who made his 10th start Saturday, can earn a bonus of $500,000 if he 
makes 20 starts this season. He also is eligible to earn $100,000 for every 
start beginning with his 21st and ending with his 30th. 
</P>
<P>
 A lengthy strike not only would prevent Magrane from reaching the incentives, 
but would cost him $1 million for 1995. Magrane's contract calls for $2.5 
million in 1995 if he makes 20 starts in 1994, but $1.5 million if he fails to 
make 20 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware of what a strike would mean," Magrane said, "but my support lies 
with the union. Sure, it can cost me a lot of money, but people before gave up 
a lot more than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane is one of several players who may be forfeiting lucrative incentives 
this season: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Designated hitter Chili Davis receives $125,000 for every 50 plate 
appearances beginning with his 300th, kicking up to $150,000 for his 500th, 
worth a potential $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Left fielder Bo Jackson receives $200,000 for every 10 games beginning with 
his 80th, worth a potential $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reliever Craig Lefferts has begun receiving $75,000 for every fifth game he 
appears until his 40th, and then will earn $100,000 every fifth game beginning 
with his 45th, worth a potential $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reliever Bob Patterson picked up his first $50,000 incentive this week, and 
will continue to receive $50,000 for every five appearances through his 45th. 
He then will receive $75,000 for every five appearances, worth a potential 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Eduardo Perez, who's expected to be called up at the All-Star 
break, aggravated his left wrist injury Friday night on a check-swing, Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann said. He was scheduled to miss Saturday's game, 
Lachemann said, and will be examined today by Dr. Lewis Yocum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Fever: Angel starter Mark Langston, a soccer star in high school, 
brought out a soccer ball Saturday and began kicking it around in the outfield. 
Before long, outfielders Jim Edmonds and Rex Hudler joined him in an impromptu 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost enjoyed soccer more than I did baseball," Langston said. "I'd like 
to have gone farther (in soccer) but the opportunity wasn't there, so it became 
a pretty easy choice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole outfielder Dwight Smith, traded from the Angels on June 14, 
says the managerial firing jinx is following him: 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I go," he said, "a manager is sure to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has played for six managers in his five-year career, including three 
this season, and now hears the rumors that his latest, Johnny Oates, could be 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What was so rare about Angel third baseman Spike Owen's strikeout Monday 
against Seattle starter Randy Johnson? 
</P>
<P>
 Owen had gone 28 games, 92 at-bats and 109 plate appearances since his last 
strikeout May 8 against Oakland. BOB NIGHTENGALE

HE'LL DO IN A PINCH; BONNER, REPRIEVED FROM FLAG FOOTBALL, NOW POSTING BIG 
NUMBERS IN ARENA LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherdrick Bonner doesn't mind the pain, because it's a happy kind of hurt, 
like something Mr. Rogers would feel. 
</P>
<P>
 And, hey, pinching yourself isn't exactly life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what Bonner does constantly, just to make sure that what he sees is 
not another mirage. Of course, in the desert heat of Phoenix, where the former 
Cal State Northridge quarterback plays for the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena 
Football League, mirages are considered landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner, however, doesn't mind sweating. Not when he is having the best time of 
his football life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun," Bonner said. "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 With good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, Bonner was keeping his 6-foot-4, 197-pound body in shape in a 
flag football league at Cleveland High when a conversation with a teammate 
altered his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my friends was coming up here for a tryout and he asked the team if I 
could come up too," Bonner said from Phoenix. "I threw the ball real well. They 
asked me to go to another combine at El Camino College (in Torrance) and I 
signed right there to go to training camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner, 25, spent last season backing up starter Paul Justin and played 
sparingly. But when Justin signed in the off-season with the Indianapolis Colts 
of the NFL, Coach Danny White handed the job to Bonner, who made a smooth 
transition to the arena game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's big, he's accurate, but probably more than that, he's a guy you feel you 
can depend on," said White, the former Dallas Cowboy quarterback. "He's a great 
team leader on and off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 After five games this season, Bonner was among the league's passing leaders 
with 90 completions in 162 attempts for 1,232 yards and 22 touchdowns. He had 
thrown for 200 or more yards in each game to help the Rattlers to a 4-1 record 
in the American Conference, one-half game behind first-place Albany (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Those kinds of individual numbers would please anyone, and Bonner is not 
complaining, but he is more concerned about other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stats don't mean much to me, except throwing (interceptions), because I'm 
sure Danny would kill me," Bonner said. "It's gratifying to know that I can 
help my team win." 
</P>
<P>
 He has done that even while adjusting to the compressed dimensions of the 
arena game. Although the field is only 50 yards long and 58 feet wide, leaving 
little room to scramble and little time to mull over options, Bonner says he 
likes the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little harder than regular football because you have to make your 
reads much quicker," Bonner said. "When you are in regular football, you can 
hang on to the ball a little longer, but here the pass protection doesn't hold 
as long." 
</P>
<P>
 But the decibel level from the crowds at the America West Arena is 
unrelenting, although that's an aspect of the arena football ambience that 
Bonner finds appealing. With the exception of one time this year, when they 
fell barely short, the Rattlers have sold out every home game they have played 
the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans are so close, it's like being on stage," Bonner said. "They can hear 
you talking and it's so loud in there, it's like a circus. But I like to feel 
their emotions. They adore their sports people (in Phoenix). They are behind us 
totally." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner, who rooms with wide receiver Cedric Tillman, says that he is enjoying 
Arizona so much that he would like to live there permanently regardless of what 
happens with his career. He is playing a lot of golf in his spare time and 
relishes every bit of his newfound good fortune, something he never anticipated 
a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge, Bonner was a multifaceted athlete who played football, 
basketball and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 As a quarterback for the Matadors from 1987 through 1990, Bonner completed 319 
of 637 pass attempts for 3,533 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 He ranks second in school history in the first two categories behind Bruce 
Lemmerman (351 of 830 attempts from 1965-67) and third in the other behind 
Lemmerman (4,317 yards) and Chris Parker (3,825 yards in 1985 and '86). 
</P>
<P>
 But despite those outstanding numbers, his days of serious football came to a 
screeching halt after college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really at a crossroads," Bonner said. "I really wanted to play more 
football, but the opportunity wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Without a clear direction, Bonner said, he worked at different jobs and played 
flag football on weekends, never dreaming it would keep him sharp for what 
would follow.  
</P>
<P>
 White and the Rattlers are happy Bonner knocked on their door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed him immediately at our tryouts, just the way he threw the ball and 
how he conducted himself," White said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he had the physical attributes to play but I was looking for the 
intangibles in a quarterback, and he has them. He wants to learn, he is 
tremendously competitive and very smart. I just thoroughly enjoy working with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner says that having White, an outstanding quarterback in his day, as his 
mentor has been a blessing. But he admits that Justin's move to the NFL is 
making him reach for a new plain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working hard to be prepared mentally to take over for Paul," Bonner 
said. "I'm just trying to stay consistent, show a lot of poise, and hopefully 
things will work out to where maybe I can play at the next level, too." 
</P>
<P>
 That would call for some major self-pinching.

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; HEAVENLY MATRICULATION ANDERSON'S NEXT MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If minor league baseball were like college, Garret Anderson would have 
graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while many college graduates wait for an opening in the job market, 
Anderson is waiting for an opening in the Angels' outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a former Kennedy High standout, is having his best minor league 
season, hitting .353 with six home runs and 53 runs batted in for triple-A 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can ask him to do much more," said Ken Forsch, Angels' 
director of minor league operations. "He's done everything you could ask in 
triple-A. The only thing he can do is wait for the call." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Forsch said Anderson is ready for the majors, it is not his call. 
That decision will be made by General Manager Bill Bavasi and Manager Marcel 
Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is the Angels have no openings in their outfield. Center fielder 
Chad Curtis and right fielder Tim Salmon are entrenched in the lineup, and left 
fielder Jim Edmonds has played himself into rookie of the year contention by 
hitting .331 and playing good defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson, who turns 22 on Thursday, continues to improve while he waits. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting slowly this season, he raised his average with a 27-game 
hitting streak. He hit safely in 42 of 44 games during a stretch. And his home 
run total is two more than his career high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with maturity, he's gotten a little stronger and has a little more 
pop," Forsch said. "I'd say he's done all he can do in triple-A." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Angels: Vancouver left-hander Andrew Lorraine, from Hart High, might also 
be ready for the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with him," Forsch said. "I would say if (the Angels) 
needed an arm, I wouldn't hesitate to bring him up." 
</P>
<P>
 Forsch is impressed by Lorraine's work habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we asked him to go to winter ball because we thought he needed to 
get some innings in, and the next thing I knew, he was in Miami trying to get a 
visa to go to Venezuela. You have to admire a kid like that," Forsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine, 21, is 7-3 with a 3.59 earned-run average in his first full pro 
season. He was drafted in the fourth round out of Stanford last June and shot 
near the top of the Angels' list of prospects by going 4-1 with a 1.29 ERA at 
Class-A Boise, Idaho. He spent a few weeks in the major league camp this spring 
before he was sent to triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Movin' up: Joe Rosselli, who missed virtually the entire 1993 season with 
shoulder problems, doesn't seem to have been slowed on his progress through the 
San Francisco Giants' system. Rosselli was called up to triple-A Phoenix this 
week, and he made his first start Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, 22, an Alemany graduate, was 7-2 with a 1.89 ERA for double-A 
Shreveport, La., when he got the call. Although he gave up seven runs in 5 1/3 
innings and lost in his first start for Phoenix, the Giants are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should really do well at triple-A because of the type of pitcher he is," 
said Brian Sabean, Giants' president of scouting and player personnel. 
"Hopefully this should be a springboard for his promotion to the big leagues, 
if not this year certainly next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli progressed steadily until last season, when he had shoulder surgery, 
limiting him to 23 innings at double-A. He needed only 90 2/3 innings this 
season before the Giants determined he was ready to move up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how anybody is going to respond after an injury, but Joe is 
such a hard worker that he is a little ahead of schedule," Sabean said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Buy a ticket: Buffalo first baseman Rich Aude created a stir earlier this 
season when he stood at home plate and watched his ninth-inning, game-winning 
home run sail over the fence against Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 The umpires had to escort Aude, a former Chatsworth standout, around the bases 
to prevent a fight, according to Brian Green, who works in the Bisons' front 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitcher said a few things to me and I said a few things to him," Aude 
said. "It was just one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Jackson imitations notwithstanding, Aude, 22, has done his best to push 
himself into the major leagues. He is hitting .293 with 12 home runs and 46 
RBIs, all at triple-A. Aude spent last season bouncing between double-A, 
triple-A and even a short September stint in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have moved up a level and it's a little tougher, but I think I am keeping 
my head above water," Aude said. 
</P>

 Comeback trail: Montreal Expos' prospect Brad Fullmer is ahead of schedule in 
his rehabilitation from April shoulder surgery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer, a former infielder at Montclair Prep, said he feels no pain and will 
be able to hit after his July 11 follow-up examination with Dr. Frank Jobe, who 
performed the surgery. Fullmer said he expects to be able to throw about two 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could probably do everything now, but they don't want to rush it," Fullmer 
said. "It's ahead of schedule, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer, 19, who said he was lifting five-pound weights a week after his 
surgery, is expected to play in instructional league in the fall, and he may 
then move to an off-season league for prospects such as the Arizona Fall 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer was drafted by the Expos in the second round last year, and he 
subsequently received a $417,500 bonus, the largest ever for a second-round 
pick. But he has yet to play a regular-season professional game because he 
signed late last year and the shoulder problem kept him from playing this year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Tim Laker, a graduate of Simi Valley High, has been a hot hitter 
lately with Ottawa, the Expos' triple-A affiliate. Laker, 24, is batting .301 
with four home runs and 27 RBIs. Last season, Laker hit .230 in 56 games at 
triple-A and .198 in 43 games with the Expos. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary, the triple-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners, was the highest 
scoring team in the minors through the end of May, and one of the contributors 
was former Hueneme High and Oxnard College standout Jerry Willard, who is 
hitting .326 with 41 RBIs. Willard, 34, has 14 home runs, tied for fifth in the 
Pacific Coast League.

FOR CHERGEY, THIS WAS A HOME RUN THAT SPANNED A CONTINENT; BASEBALL: PITCHING 
IN THE FLORIDA STATE LEAGUE, HE HAS ROUGH OUTING, THEN IS PROMOTED TWO NOTCHES 
TO TRIPLE-A EDMONTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Minor league pitcher Dan Chergey didn't allow a run for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged a strikeout per inning and fanned an average of five batters for 
each one that he walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents were batting a measly .185. 
</P>
<P>
 There were rumors of a promotion to Portland, Me., home of the Florida 
Marlins' double-A baseball affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he had a bad day. 
</P>
<P>
 And the next thing he knew, the former Thousand Oaks High standout was in 
triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost one year to the day after he signed with the Marlins as a 22nd-round 
draft choice from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Chergey was a member of the 
Edmonton Trappers, competing at a level only one step below the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lose a game by giving up a big home run and you get promoted," said 
Chergey, who allowed a two-out, two-run home run to lose, 6-5, against Daytona 
in his last Class-A outing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first homer -- and only the 20th hit -- that Chergey gave up in 31 
2/3 innings over 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was probably my worst outing," Chergey said by telephone last week from 
Albuquerque, N.M. "It's funny how things work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Chergey, a 23-year-old right-hander, is the only Marlin prospect this season 
to be promoted directly from Class A to Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys catch lightning in a bottle," said John Boles, the Marlins' 
director of player development. "He's really made improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season in the short-season Class-A New York-Penn League, Chergey had a 
record of 3-5 and an earned-run average of 3.50 as a starter for Elmira. He 
allowed an average of more than a hit per inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after he had a strong spring, Marlin officials initially balked at 
promoting him to Brevard County, which competes in the Florida State League, a 
high Class-A league. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both Class-A leagues, but (Brevard County is) a big jump," Boles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chergey, after making the transition from starter to relief pitcher during the 
spring, was up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brevard County opened its season on April 7. Chergey gave up his first run on 
May 14, in his 15th appearance. He did far more than survive. He became the 
stopper for a first-place team, accumulating nine saves and earning a spot in 
the Florida State League all-star game in Port St. Lucie. 
</P>
<P>
 Chergey did not take part Saturday. He was playing a three-game series against 
Minnesota's triple-A affiliate in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 The series could be Chergey's last with the Trappers this season. His 
promotion came because the Marlins had several major league pitchers on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton pitchers were called up to fill spots on the organization's big 
league roster, leaving openings at triple-A. A few of those pitchers are ready 
to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Chergey, who was promoted June 16, was told he would be with the Trappers for 
as little as four days or as long as two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been almost two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me up front that staying up here wasn't an option," Chergey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's OK. I'm up here getting a taste of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Boles said the Marlins chose to promote from within rather than sign a veteran 
free agent because Chergey would benefit from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very competitive, hard-working guy," Boles said. "He deserved a reward 
for his first half." 
</P>
<P>
 Chergey attributes his success to improved arm strength and control. Also, his 
herky-jerky, three-quarter delivery might be better suited to relief work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be a little tougher for a hitter to see me one or two innings rather 
than have six innings to make an adjustment," Chergey said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they're only seeing me once I probably have a little better chance at 
getting them out." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Chergey's unorthodox style hasn't been a mystery to triple-A batters. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first outing for Edmonton, he entered the game in the eighth inning 
with the Trappers leading, 4-2. Four hits -- including back-to-back doubles -- 
later, Edmonton was on its way to a 5-4 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been taking my licks up here," said Chergey, who also was scored upon in 
his next two appearances. "It's tough. I had all that success. Now this." 
</P>
<P>
 Nerves haven't been the problem. If anything, Chergey might be too relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe I need to get a little ticked off and be more of a bulldog out 
there," he said. "But really, I don't feel like I'm pitching poorly. The breaks 
just haven't been with me here and the results haven't been the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Boles said the Marlins won't soon lose confidence in a pitcher who has fast 
become one of the steals in the 1993 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll bounce back," Boles predicted. "He's got all the intangibles you look 
for. He's intelligent and competitive, a bulldog-type guy, fearless on the 
mound. He's one of those guys who might go a long way because of his makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 He has already.

SNOW TAKES A SWING AT ALL OF HIS DOUBTERS; BASEBALL: ANGEL INFIELDER BELIEVES 
HE NEEDS TO KEEP HITTING TO GET PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON THIS SEASON, NOT LAST 
SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He is loath to admit it, but J.T. Snow carries a heavy burden of expectation 
with him each time he steps to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Can he duplicate his torrid hitting of April, 1993? If so, when? If not, why? 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much he tries to bury the past, he can't escape from it. Perhaps 
only by showing others there is a present and future to consider can the first 
baseman truly put it behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 With each passing hit, he attempts to make last year, as he said Saturday, 
"last year." 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to hammer away on that theme, however simplistic it may be, after 
hitting a three-run homer in the Angels' 12-7 victory over Texas at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, a single to right in the third inning and a homer in the eighth, 
helped the Angels beat Texas on a warm Saturday night. Nothing more, nothing 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-run homer was the final blow in a seven-run eighth inning that 
rallied the Angels past the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 And winning, he said, was what counted most of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we showed a lot of perseverance in that inning," he said after 
raising his average to .222. "We could have given up. They just kept coming 
back at us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels trailed, 7-5, going into the eighth, but thanks to a funny bounce 
and a lot of hustle, they built a 9-7 lead when Snow stepped into the batter's 
box to face reliever Cris Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow had singled in the third, taking what starter Kevin Brown had given him, 
serving it neatly into left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Carpenter, Snow quickly fell behind 0-and-2. There were two outs with 
Chili Davis standing at third and Rex Hudler at second. 
</P>
<P>
 It figured to be a pivotal at-bat. If Carpenter retired Snow, the Angels would 
have a two-run lead with Ivan Rodriguez, batting .286 with eight homers, Jose 
Canseco (.297, 21 homers) and Will Clark (.356, 10 homers) coming up in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter then threw a pitch down and in and Snow swung easily, lofting a high 
drive that arched deep into the Texas bullpen in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Snow's second homer of the season and impressed Manager Marcel 
Lachemann, who liked the way Snow wouldn't give in to Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a good at-bat for him," Lachemann said. "He fouled off some pretty 
good pitches and it didn't look like he overswung on that ball." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ball still flew an estimated 404 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (home runs) all feel good, but that one was special," Snow said. "I was 
down in the count. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all going crazy on the bench (during the big inning). It finally 
seemed like we were getting some breaks. It was like a little light went on and 
we got some smiles on our faces." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Angels to within 2 1/2 games of first-place Texas, which 
Snow said made it even more important. 
</P>
<P>
 Having ended a zero-for-21 slide with his first homer of the season Tuesday, 
he has quietly put together an impressive home stand. After Saturday's game, he 
has six hits in his past 19 at-bats, a .316 average. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to keep believing in ourselves," said Snow, recalled June 4 from 
triple-A Vancouver. "In a division that's this tight, you have to have a sense 
of where you're going." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, there's no sense looking back.

HE'S ONLY BASHING THE BALL THESE DAYS; WORKING THROUGH ARM INJURY IN '93 HELPS 
CANSECO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It used to be so easy to bash Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
 Host of late-night talk shows could always count on the slugger's occasional 
acts of stupidity -- such as the time he blew out his elbow pitching, or had a 
fly ball bounce off his head and over the fence for a home run, or rammed his 
wife's Porsche with his Ferrari -- for fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripping Canseco was easy for fans who grew tired of his often surly demeanor, 
the way he snarled at autograph seekers and snapped at reporters, and his 
seemingly annual run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the muscular Canseco could pound the baseball and was one of the game's 
most exciting players once he stepped into the batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
 But to many, Canseco was just another on the growing list of overpaid, 
overexposed players who didn't seem to care about the game or the fans, a 
sentiment that might have been best portrayed by the photo of him wearing a 
T-shirt that blared: "Leave Me Alone!" 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Canseco do for an encore in 1994? He comes through with a season 
that has so confounded Jose-haters that they might even be starting to like the 
guy. Or, at least, respect him. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco is off to one of his best starts ever. Through Friday's game, he's 
batting .297 with a team-leading 21 home runs and 67 runs batted in for the 
Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The designated hitter has bounced back from elbow surgery that ended his 1993 
season in May and is among the American League leaders in homers, RBIs, 
multi-hit games (31), runs (64), walks (50) and total bases (153). 
</P>
<P>
 What's truly amazing is that it's almost July and Canseco hasn't punched 
anyone in a bar, gotten any speeding tickets or been caught with a gun in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no photos of Canseco with Madonna, and even though World Cup 
fever is catching on, Canseco has not felt the urge to head another baseball 
into the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has been very quiet off the field and very loud on it," said Tom 
Grieve, Texas general manager. "That's the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 With Canseco's success has come a transformation of sorts in major league 
stadiums. Where once there were only boos and expletives hurled at Canseco, now 
there is a smattering of applause and praise when his name is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium this weekend is a perfect example. The reception for Canseco 
during the Rangers' series against the Angels has been virtually split, with 
about as many cheers as jeers when he steps to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people like me, more so this year because of what I've been through," 
said Canseco, who in 1988 became the first player to hit 40 home runs and steal 
40 bases in one season. "The way I brought myself up from the bottom to be 
successful, people appreciate that. Fans have been better everywhere because 
they realize what I've been through." 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco's career bottomed out during one week in May, 1993. There was the May 
26 game in Cleveland when Canseco, doing his best Alexi Lalas impersonation, 
lost track of a fly ball that bounced off his head and over the right-field 
fence for a homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, in Boston, Canseco talked his way onto the mound during the 
eighth inning of a 15-1 loss to the Red Sox. He threw 33 pitches and tore a 
ligament in his right elbow, an injury that required surgery last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two incidents, in which Canseco said he "embarrassed myself, the team 
and the manager," punctuated a three-year period that included the separation, 
reconciliation and divorce from his wife, Esther, with whom he had a stormy 
four-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco, who turns 30 this week, admitted having suicidal thoughts and 
acknowledged that he underwent counseling for depression last winter at the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in addition to his rigorous off-season physical rehabilitation 
program, which has helped Canseco recapture the form that made him one of 
baseball's most feared hitters during his days with the Oakland Athletics and 
Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have been remarkable. The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Canseco, who was 
slowed by several nagging injuries in 1992 and '93, has regained full strength 
in his legs and back and expects his arm to be healthy enough to return to the 
outfield later this season. 
</P>
<P>
 His bat speed has returned, and any questions of his power were put to rest 
June 3, when his towering homer appeared to clear the light standard above the 
Green Monster in Fenway Park, and June 13, when he hit three homers against the 
Seattle Mariners, including a 480-foot bomb that was announced as the longest 
home run hit not only in the new Ballpark in Arlington, but also in Arlington 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And, get this: Canseco is happy.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's gotten rid of a lot of baggage and he's healthy," said Willie Upshaw, 
the Rangers' batting coach. "When he comes to the park he's totally focused on 
baseball. You can tell when guys are having problems off the field, but he's 
shown every day that nothing is bothering him." 
</P>
<P>
 From the time the Rangers acquired Canseco from Oakland for pitchers Jeff 
Russell and Bobby Witt and outfielder Ruben Sierra in August, 1992, until this 
season, Canseco seemed to go through life with a pained look on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd usually show up at the park only minutes before the Rangers took batting 
practice, and he was usually one of the first to leave the clubhouse after 
games. You didn't have to talk to him to know he wasn't having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell by his facial expressions that something was bothering him," 
Grieve said. "He'd come out of the hotel and get on the team bus with this dour 
look on his face. It was subtle, but it was obvious he was not relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this year he has a bounce in his step and a smile on his face. You see 
him interact with his teammates, talk with the press, how he reacts after 
hitting a home run, and it's obvious he's having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of off-the-field problems, his 1992 divorce and a clean bill of 
health have given Canseco a new outlook on his career. And his approach to the 
game has changed considerably -- he comes to the park earlier, coaches say his 
work habits are excellent, and he's been more open to suggestions and 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many distractions before, but now I can give 100% to the game," 
said Canseco, who ranked among the major league's top five in homers (240) and 
RBIs (767) from 1986-93. "My approach has been a lot more positive and I'm 
enjoying the game again. I don't let things bother me like they used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco has called last season's arm injury "a blessing in disguise." His 
elbow and shoulder had been hurting for two years, but he continued to play 
through the pain. Doctors have told him that in compensating for the shoulder 
injury, he actually might have hurt his elbow before pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pitching injury forced Canseco to have surgery, in which a tendon was 
removed from his left wrist and used to replace the torn ligament in his right 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back it was the wrong thing to do, letting a star player pitch," 
Grieve said. "But out of any misfortune, some positive can come out of it. 
Without that incident, maybe Jose never has surgery, his strength doesn't come 
back, and maybe he doesn't return to the status he has." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Canseco continues to excel on the field and avoid problems off the 
field, maybe he won't return to his status as one of baseball's most despised 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like Reggie Jackson -- there's a movie-star aura about him," Grieve 
said. "He's a celebrity, a star. He loves that and accepts everything that goes 
with it. There are people who love to hate him . . . but I've seen a lot less 
of that this year." 
</P>
<P>
 So has Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media even likes me now -- I don't understand that," Canseco said. "I've 
given up a lot of my time for them, but it has made things more enjoyable. You 
like it when people say positive things about you."

<P>
 For a change.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; DON'T MOCK THESE DRAFT PICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the finals demonstrated, this league could use some new stars, some new 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Here come the candidates to be one or the other or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a league that lost Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, the 
question is who is going to replace them," Indiana Pacer General Manager Donnie 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shaq (O'Neal) has been pushed into the forefront, but I don't know if he can 
handle it. These kids may be more of how the league wants to be represented." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll see, won't we? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it looks before Wednesday's draft (heights are barefoot, and on 
that basis, Hakeem Olajuwon is really 6 feet 10 and Charles Barkley 6-4 1/2): 
</P>
<P>
 1. Milwaukee Bucks -- Glenn Robinson, 6-7, 240, Purdue. Chicago Coach Phil 
Jackson says, "I don't think he's the greatest thing since sliced bread," but 
admirers think the Big Dog is the closest thing we've seen to Bird since Bird. 
He's a Big quiet Dog though. In school, he often didn't talk after he'd had big 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dallas Mavericks -- Jason Kidd, 6-3, 215, California. Admirers -- such as 
Johnson -- think he's the best point guard prospect since Johnson. The 
Mavericks are sticking with him despite an arrest in a hit-and-run traffic case 
and word of a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Detroit Pistons -- Grant Hill, 6-8, 230, Duke. Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski 
says anyone who passes on him will feel like Portland for passing on Jordan in 
'84. Hill is a Scottie Pippen type who can play either guard or small forward 
but is bigger than Pippen and a better shooter than Pippen was at this stage. 
Wonderful young man with a glowing personality. David Stern must be burning 
incense under his picture. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Minnesota Timberwolves -- Donyell Marshall, 6-8 1/2, 218, Connecticut. They 
like Juwan Howard, too, but they don't think Christian Laettner can guard small 
forwards. They take this big-time prospect, even if he did have a shaky NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Washington Bullets -- Howard, 6-8 1/2, 253, Michigan. They're delighted to 
take the Wolverine power forward, a true grinder who has already promised not 
to hold out, saying he needs to be in camp early, making him the general 
managers' early candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Philadelphia 76ers -- Sharone Wright, 6-10, 279, Clemson. The 76ers get an 
athletic power forward to finish off their front line of 7-7 Shawn Bradley and 
burly Clarence Weatherspoon. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Clippers -- Lamond Murray, 6-6 1/2, 236, Cal. They are reportedly offering 
this pick and Mark Jackson to Dallas for Jamal Mashburn, but if it doesn't 
happen, they've always needed a shooter. He would also be insurance in case 
they don't sign Dominique Wilkins, a growing possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Sacramento Kings -- Brian Grant, 6-8 1/2, 247, Xavier. He dialed his draft 
status up about 10 spots in postseason camps. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Boston Celtics -- Eric Montross, 7-0 1/2, 275, North Carolina. They exhale 
after he gets past Sacramento and jump on him. NBA scout Marty Blake, whose 
chief job is to hype the draft, compared Montross to Greg Dreiling, but most 
people think he's a lot better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Lakers -- Khalid Reeves, 6-1 1/2, 205, Arizona. Some people think he's the 
next Joe Dumars, a heady, strong guard who can play both spots. Jerry West 
wisely forgets about need and grabs the best player. Maybe some day they can 
get a high pick and do it the easy way. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Seattle SuperSonics -- Aaron McKie, 6-4 1/2, 216, Temple. With Bob 
Whitsitt gone, George Karl loath to get involved in personnel and Wally Walker 
newly arrived in the front office, they would rather trade the pick for a big 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Miami Heat -- Eric Mobley, 6-10 1/2, 259, Pittsburgh. Sophomore Yinka Dare 
was supposed to go in the lottery, looked bad in workouts, refused to visit 
here, thinking he was going higher, and keeps falling. 
</P>
<P>
 13. Denver Nuggets -- Jalen Rose, 6-6, 231, Michigan. They want a point guard. 
He's a weird player, but he can handle the ball and has a boss-type 
personality. He could hit big or miss completely. 
</P>
<P>
 14. New Jersey Nets -- Eric Piatkowski, 6-6, 214, Nebraska. He wowed them at 
the Desert Classic in Phoenix. They're still looking for a shooter to replace 
Drazen Petrovic. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Pacers -- Tony Dumas, 6-4, 178, Missouri Kansas City. Little-known guy 
with big-time talent and question-mark head. You can just hear Larry Brown 
telling Walsh: "I can work with him!" 
</P>
<P>
 16. Golden State Warriors -- Jim McIlvaine, 7-1, 244, Marquette. Don Nelson is 
telling people he's no good, which suggests something. They really want to deal 
for a big player -- Will Perdue and the Bulls' pick? 
</P>
<P>
 17. Portland Trail Blazers -- Wesley Person, 6-5 1/2, 192, Auburn. Chuck's 
brother, quieter and, with a career 44% mark on three-pointers, the best 
shooter in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 18. Bucks -- Carlos Rogers, 6-10, 214, Tennessee State. Unpolished but 
athletic. Big haul for Mike Dunleavy. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Mavericks -- Dare, 6-10 1/2, 271, George Washington. Incredible hulk but 
doesn't react to the ball. In NBA terms, that's like saying your pupils don't 
dilate when they shine a light in your eye. With one solid pick in the bank, 
the Mavericks have a shot to take. 
</P>
<P>
 20. 76ers -- Eddie Jones, 6-6, 190, Temple. A talented wing player who could 
have gone 10 picks higher. 
</P>
<P>
 21. Chicago Bulls -- Greg Minor, 6-6, 228, Louisville. Averaged 13 a game as a 
senior but made all-star teams at Portsmouth and Phoenix draft camps. 
</P>
<P>
 22. San Antonio Spurs -- Charlie Ward, 6-0 1/2, 184, Florida State. Texas' 
B.J. Tyler is regarded as the second-best point guard in the draft, but he had 
a drinking problem and new owner Robert (Call Me General) McDermott likes them 
squeaky clean. 
</P>
<P>
 23. Phoenix Suns -- Dickey Simpkins, 6-8 1/2, 245, Providence. Power forward 
who was all-tournament at Portsmouth and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 24. New York Knicks -- Monty Williams, 6-7 1/2, 227, Notre Dame. A Lafonso 
Ellis type, he would have been in the lottery except for a heart problem. 
Williams has been cleared by doctors, but that kind of thing scares pro teams. 
The Pacers considered him, but after he took a physical for them, they were so 
alarmed they scaled back their drills. 
</P>
<P>
 25. Clippers -- Cliff Rozier, 6-10, 260, Louisville. On talent, he would have 
been in the lottery, but his work ethic isn't up to snuff. Hard to pass up this 
far down the line, though, with one pick in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 26. Knicks -- Dontonio Wingfield, 6-7 1/2, 246, Cincinnati. He's either the 
second coming of George McGinnis . . . or Jesse James. After finishing high 
school in Albany, Ga., Wingfield tore up his mother's kitchen (reportedly 
because she wouldn't let him use the car) and she called the police. He pleaded 
guilty to two counts of obstructing justice and one count of criminal damage to 
property. He enrolled at Cincinnati but quit after his freshman year. Knick 
personnel chief Ernie Grunfeld notes that there was a lot of gossip about Shawn 
Kemp too, and the Knicks have a pick to waste. But this guy and Pat Riley? I 
don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 27. Orlando Magic -- Tyler, 6-0, 173, Texas. The Magic wants to trade Scott 
Skiles and use his $1.7-million slot to pursue Horace Grant and will need a 
backup point guard. THANKS FOR COMING, DOMINIQUE WILKINS 
</P>
<P>
 It was incredible six months ago when the Clippers sorted through all the 
packages they were being offered for Danny Manning and chose the 34-year-old 
Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins came to town, charmed everyone, averaged 29 points his first month, 
drew a big crowd or two and even got the Clippers on a brief roll. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they failed to come up with the money he thought he was about to get 
-- $21 million for three years -- he went into a funk that engulfed the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing thing is that both sides agree that the Clippers knew his asking 
price before the trade. Their first offer, however, was $8 million for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, they tacked on the extra year he wanted . . . but dropped the 
offer to $7.5 million plus annual $800,000 bonuses for making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A Clipper official insists they remain eager to sign Wilkins, but his agent, 
Steve Kauffman, is telling people privately they aren't even trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins has few options. Kauffman says he might sit it out until a new labor 
agreement is signed, which could raise the salary cap -- now at $16 million -- 
above $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is making the rounds: the Knicks. They need firepower. 
They might have Rolando Blackman's $2-million slot. Wilkins might work for 
short money for a season to get out of here. 
</P>
<P>
 In case he does, farewell to yet another great Clipper.

WORKERS' ROMP; PLAYING WAR IN THE WOODS PAINTS MORALE A NEW SHADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Corder, a weekend general, has a momentary vision of glory. He sends his 
decoy troops to the left and takes two other soldiers into the brush on the 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're up ahead in the bush," he whispers. Then he creeps forward, engages 
the pump on his rifle and opens fire. But the enemy isn't fooled. The canyon is 
filled with the sounds of "bullets" whistling through the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, purple paint drips from Corder's camouflage outfit. The 
opposing team had the drop on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hit," says Corder, co-founder and vice president of engineering at 
Irvine-based New Media Corp., a 3-year-old company that makes components for 
laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dead man!" shouts Jade Marsh, the referee. "Let 'em out!" 
</P>
<P>
 Corder walks away with his air-powered assault weapon above his head and joins 
other "dead zone" colleagues -- heroes awaiting the reincarnation that comes 
with the beginning of the next round. With mineral waters and sodas in hand, 
they talk about their battlefield exploits. War is hell. Messy, too. 
</P>
<P>
 This popular sport, an exhilarating and exhausting grown-up version of Capture 
the Flag played with water-soluble colors that quickly evaporate, is known as 
paint ball. New Media's owners organize a game a few times a year to build 
company morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Using recreation to improve employee morale is nothing new. Companies such as 
IBM and AT&T, for instance, have "assessment centers" where they put their 
managers through rigorous psychological exercises and games as tests of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying philosophy is to (improve) performance by getting employees 
more comfortable with each other and working in groups," said Chris Earley, 
professor of management at UC Irvine. "People argue about the best way to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive games like paint ball, however, aren't ideal for every company, 
Earley warns. "Paint ball is one way of looking at how employees react to 
stress, but I would be careful about applying the lessons to the workplace," he 
said. "Some people react to it because it is politically incorrect and 
war-like. Tempers can flare. I wouldn't say it glorifies war. But some people 
would." 
</P>
<P>
 Team activities to build morale range from more relaxing events such as 
bowling teams and golf tournaments to weeks-long backpacking excursions 
sponsored by groups such as Pacific Crest Outward Bound School in Portland, 
Ore., in which participants learn how to survive in the wilderness together. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaryl Courtemanche, an organizational consultant in Denver, said that 
ropes-training courses are particularly useful in building interdependence 
among co-workers' teams without unnecessarily pitting people against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 In such courses, including those offered by The Venture Center in Boulder, 
Colo., teams of employees have to learn to trust and depend on each other while 
using ropes to cross streams and scale heights. 
</P>
<P>
 But New Media Corp., which expects sales of $54 million this year, has made 
paint ball its game of choice for enhancing morale because it fits the young 
company's aggressive corporate culture, it's a relatively inexpensive weekend 
outing and -- perhaps most important -- the top executives think it's fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really important is getting the different functions of the company to 
work together," said Carl Perkins, president and co-founder. "Too often the 
people in engineering and sales and marketing don't mix socially. Here, they 
can respect each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric McAfee, chief financial officer and another co-founder, said the company 
asks a lot of its employees, so it's important to let them relax, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have to deal with each other day after day. It's important that 
they have fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For similar reasons, numerous companies make their way to the California Paint 
Ball Ranch, which owner Ray Covell opened last year in the foothills of San 
Gabriel Canyon near Azusa. For individuals, he charges $40 for field, gun and 
mask rentals -- groups receive discounts. On the side, he raises Clydesdale 
show horses. The ranch is one of a dozen in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Kamiya, editor of Action Pursuit Games magazine in Burbank, said that 
the 13-year-old sport is growing, though not as fast as during its heyday in 
the mid-1980s. The magazine has an international circulation of 80,000 and is 
one of about two dozen journals that cover the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses like the sport because you get to see a genuine reaction of how 
employees behave under stress," Kamiya said. "You can determine if somebody's a 
leader or a follower." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Wilcox, a vice president and industrial psychologist with Personnel 
Decisions Inc., a consulting firm in Minneapolis, said he believes that paint 
ball is a useful team-building tool, but it has its limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-day event that cost about $12,000, his counseling firm will get a 
company's work group to defend itself against an attack from paint ball experts 
and then debrief the workers later about how they can apply the lessons at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The events are usually geared toward executives or sales staffs. Because paint 
ball is competitive, Wilcox said he usually tries to combine it with a 
cooperative event in which employees are urged to help each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a good thing to awaken the warrior within the employee to get them 
to focus on the external competition," he said. "Too often we have to go into 
companies losing market share and losing sight of the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're careful with it because we don't want to trivialize war for people who 
have been in it and we don't want to romanticize it for those who haven't been 
in it. We don't pit one set of employees against another. Unless you debrief 
people, it's just fun and games." 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much interest from businesses that paint ball ranches in Arizona 
and Minnesota cater mostly to corporate clientele. Last year, Kamiya said he 
played at the private suburban paint ball ranch of Tom Pritzker, an heir in the 
wealthy Chicago family that owns a controlling stake in the Hyatt Hotel chain, 
with a number of high-tech executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Covell said he gets all kinds at the ranch. Groups as varied as the Panda Inn 
restaurant chain, officers from police departments and church groups find 
reason to fight together. On the day that New Media showed up, a Boy Scout 
troop dueled at one of the ranch's 14 battlefields. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sport seems to be quite addictive," he said. "But we've had no 
warmongers. It teaches them teamwork and camaraderie." 
</P>
<P>
 About a quarter of New Media's employees played during a recent weekend. 
Perkins enticed one engineer to come by showing him a purchase order for a 
Pentium personal computer. The lure was simple: If he didn't play, he wouldn't 
get the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 New Media's 32 soldiers -- decked in camouflage garb and face masks and armed 
with air guns that shoot purple or pink paint pellets -- started a day of 
combat with a skirmish in an avocado grove known as the "Jungle." Perkins' team 
squared off against Corder's band of engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides loaded up on paint pellets, which are like rubbery gum balls, 
and built up their courage by taking practice shots at some trees. An eerie 
silence shrouded the field as each group hid among bushes, trees and hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the whistle blew, the fighting left no room for the timid. As soon as the 
two sides met in the dense brush, the popping sounds of air guns and 
splattering paint filled the air. In the distance, real gunfire at the Fish 
Canyon shooting range in Duarte added realism. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual battle quickly dispelled notions of invincibility. Krista McInnis, 
a new employee at New Media, crept through the Jungle behind Perkins. From 
nowhere came the sound of a splatter. "Am I dead?" she asked. Purple paint 
dripped from her goggles. Yes, she was. "Dead Man!" she yelled and walked off 
the battlefield.  
</P>
<P>
 Not every warrior was up to the challenge. Brad Haney, a sales representative, 
captured the enemy flag and made a dash back to his team's side. One companion, 
out of breath, joined him in the race. The pair celebrated victory with 
high-fives, but the companion soon became ill and threw up his breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 For the whole day, the battle raged back and forth in 10 variations on Capture 
the Flag. Generally, the winner was able to sift meaning from the chaos and 
outwit the others with a coordinated strategy. The wanna-be Rambos died first 
and the patient, crafty thinkers most often captured the flags. Stragglers 
usually got picked off by teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Danielson, an accounts receivable manager, didn't start out with a 
killer instinct. She fired a close-range shot at Haney and it bounced off. She 
screamed, "I'm sorry!" as Haney turned and fired off a half-dozen shots at her. 
At 280 feet per second, the paint pellets travel much slower than bullets but 
they can leave a mean bruise at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, though, Danielson wised up. She got the referees to 
tell her where Haney was hiding so she could try to exact some revenge. She 
didn't get it, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player dressed in light brown Desert Storm fatigues, Shannon Morrison 
said she came along with her cousins who work at New Media to get better 
training to be a police officer. One paint ball left a painful welt on her 
forehead, but more often than not she left her mark on the enemy. When this 
recruit for the San Gabriel Police Department switched sides for one battle, 
the team she was leaving groaned.  
</P>
<P>
 The war did have its occasional moments of comic relief. Bryan Siebert, a 
student who joined the group, made a 100-yard dash to capture the enemy flag in 
one heated battle where his side was losing. As he ran to victory, his pants 
were falling down. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting brought out the beasts in some, teamwork in others, as well as 
leadership and an appreciation of what real fighting must be like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I know what Beirut is like," said Alan Friedl, after fighting in a 
complex of wooden buildings known as Dodge City. "All week, everybody was 
thinking about coming here and going after the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the injuries by the end of the day were not life-threatening, they were 
numerous. Jeff Wheeler had 16 black-and-blue marks on his upper body. Mike 
Friedl, the company controller and Alan's brother, had five such marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you're the bug, and sometimes you're the windshield," he said. In 
the last battle of the day, Perkins and another teammate charged through the 
Dodge City area shooting off their empty guns. The company president was hit 
about a dozen times by the opposing team. One shot pierced his mask and left 
him with a bloody lip. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way I was going to sit on the sidelines just because I had no 
ammo," Perkins said. "If we brought the lawyers out here, they'd probably be 
horrified. But I think everyone is going to be much closer on Monday morning."

JAMES FLANIGAN: CRASHING DOLLAR SIGNALS TIME FOR A COUNTERPUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do Americans pay a price for the falling U.S. dollar, which all but collapsed 
last week, beyond the obvious one of costlier vacations overseas? 
</P>
<P>
 And does the chronic trade deficit, which worsened again last week, exact a 
serious cost on the U.S. economy, ultimately reducing American living 
standards? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is yes on both questions, although you wouldn't know that from most 
expert and official reactions last week. President Clinton protested gamely 
that the U.S. economy is stronger than it has been in decades, and therefore 
the dollar's weakness was mistaken. "In the end, the markets will have to 
respond to the economic realities," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was right on fundamentals but wrong on markets. The U.S. economy is 
solid and American industry is highly competitive thanks to many virtuous years 
of lean diets and tough workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 His mistake was in saying the world would reward such virtue. Mae West knew 
better: "Goodness has nothing to do with it," the roguish actress might have 
said about foreign trade and economic relations among nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing happens without effort in those relations. The U.S. dollar has been 
falling against other currencies for almost a decade now, making U.S. goods 
cheaper on international markets. Yet the balance of trade and international 
payments continues in deficit as it has since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Those chronic deficits, totaling more than $1 trillion over 16 years, impose a 
penalty on the U.S. economy. They force the United States to borrow, at home 
and abroad, to finance annual deficits, and that forces interest rates higher 
and curbs the potential for U.S. jobs, incomes and living standards. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the backdrop to the situation we find ourselves in today, which is 
filled with paradox and foreboding. On the one hand, recent high-level visitors 
to Japan and Asia find disrespect for the Clinton Administration mounting to a 
misguided contempt for the United States itself. That's one reason the dollar 
is weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these same visitors found admiration for U.S. industry's competitive 
strength and vision to be widespread, as if confirming Clinton's boasts about 
it last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The message, therefore, is that the U.S. government needs firm, knowledgeable 
policies toward Japan and Asia but is fortunate that U.S. industry gives it a 
strong hand. 
</P>
<P>
 A few examples of trade realities will put us in the picture and give an idea 
of what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans will be surprised to learn that in Japan today, the realization 
has dawned that Japanese industry is trailing in the all-important information 
industries of computers and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders and government ministries acknowledge that American 
development of personal computers and software, cable television, CD-ROMS, the 
Internet and so on is the way to build the information highway.  
</P>
<P>
 The wake-up call for Japanese industry was the growing U.S. ability to combine 
computers with video, which made Japan's high-definition television obsolete. 
Now Japan's government plans massive investments in fiber-optic cables to 
create an information highway by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 So will we see surging exports of U.S. computers and telecommunications 
equipment to Japan? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Or will Japan open its economy and allow U.S. telecommunications companies to 
invest in and take advantage of a growing market in the world's second-largest 
economy? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Japan's government is trying to turn back the clock to the postwar 
era of government planning and targeted industries. The Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications plans to organize its Big Three telephone suppliers, 
Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi, in efforts to produce advanced telecommunications 
products for the home market and export. The Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry has its own plans for what it calls "visual information 
technology." U.S. and other foreign competitors need not apply.  
</P>
<P>
 What should be the U.S. response? Calm judgment and sharp elbows. First of 
all, realize that the old Japanese model of government-guided industry probably 
won't work. Decades of government guidance haven't given Japan a competitive 
computer industry. Japan's banks are ruled and guided by the powerful Ministry 
of Finance, but that didn't prevent them from making more than $200 billion in 
bad loans, notes Eugene Dattel, author of "The Sun That Never Rose," a new book 
on Japan's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Use sharp elbows. As it happens, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC are all bidding for 
inclusion in information highway projects in the United States. "A word from 
Undersecretary of Commerce Jeff Garten demanding reciprocity in Japan if those 
companies are to get business here could do wonders," says a U.S. expert on 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 What is called for from Washington is a serious, knowledgeable policy on 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 A critical period is coming up in the automobile industry as a new labeling 
law tightens definitions of just how many U.S. auto parts Japanese 
manufacturers are buying here. U.S. sources say the new definitions will reveal 
that Toyota, Honda and Nissan buy about half their parts from U.S. suppliers, 
but resolutely import all high-value parts such as transmissions from suppliers 
back in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 If true, the Japanese manufacturers should be called on that. Buying more 
sophisticated parts in the United States would create better jobs for Americans 
and help correct the trade deficit with Japan, two-thirds of which is in 
automobiles and parts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if Japan opened up its vast economy -- two-thirds the size 
of the U.S. economy -- the result would be better jobs and a better life for 
the majority of Japan's people. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect miracles. "Japan regards trade differently from the United 
States," writes Glen Fukushima, a former U.S. trade representative who is now 
in private business in Tokyo. "Competitiveness is not only a matter of price 
and quality, but of a host of other factors, very much including what is seen 
as best for Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 But so what? If Japan's policy works to the disadvantage of the United States, 
the Clinton Administration has a responsibility to insist on U.S. interests. 
Unfortunately, the Administration, from the President himself down to trade 
negotiator Mickey Kantor, is seen in Asia today as ignorant and weak.  
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese friends of the United States say firm action, on trade or other 
matters, is needed to restore respect and confidence," reports a recent visitor 
to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the times are demanding change. Last week's careening dollar said the 
years of deficits and drift cannot go on; it was our wake-up call.

A SKY FULL OF IMITATORS; UPSTART CHALLENGER; RENO: BIGGEST LITTLE RISK IN THE 
INDUSTRY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The name is Reno Air, but it could just as easily be called American Airlines 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, Reno grows closer to the troubled Texas-based behemoth, which is 
retreating from money-losing short flights to concentrate on more profitable 
cross-country routes. 
</P>
<P>
 American has been handing off many of its West Coast runs to 17-plane Reno 
rather than try to compete with discount carrier Southwest Airlines. Though 
American loses ticket revenue in the process, it hopes to at least maintain 
passenger loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that former customers understand the connection, Reno -- one of a 
new breed of low-cost carriers -- shares ground crews and ticket counter space 
with American in many of the 11 cities it serves. It also offers miles in 
American's frequent-flier and summer travel programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship is not as beneficial to Reno as one might think. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloft barely two years, Reno has suffered two consecutive quarters of losses 
as it has realigned itself to take advantage of its "strategic relationship" 
with American and cut non-productive routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The changeover has also brought Reno into direct competition with industry 
leader Southwest on flights to San Jose from a number of airports, including 
Los Angeles International, San Diego's Lindbergh Field and John Wayne Airport 
in Orange County, where it began service Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: One airline forecaster now considers Reno at high risk for 
financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have gradually moved out of their niche," said Steve Lowry, president of 
Aviation Forecasting & Economics in Arlington, Va. "They really stepped onto 
some competitive routes that the incumbents are not going to let them 
penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno is more inclined to view its setbacks as growing pains, the consequence 
of taking advantage of its new relationship with American. Those ties are 
prompting a metamorphosis for an airline that started out trying to match the 
service of the long-haul carriers while offering the fares of short-haul 
fliers, notably Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The monsters' costs were too high, and the new entrants were offering a 
cheapie product," said Reno's colorful chairman, Lee Hydeman. "My view was you 
could offer a good product at a good price." 
</P>
<P>
 So Reno keeps costs relatively low on the scale used by the airline industry 
-- 8 cents to fly one passenger one mile, compared to Southwest's 7.14 cents -- 
while offering assigned seating, snacks, meals and first-class sections. 
Southwest eschews such perks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno charges the same fare or only a couple of dollars more than Southwest on 
most routes. The one-way, anytime fare from Los Angeles to San Jose, for 
instance, is $69 on Southwest and $72 on Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 To hold down costs, Reno has taken advantage of the fire-sale bargains created 
in the recession-ravaged airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 It bought leftover equipment from defunct airlines such as Chicago-based 
Midway for as little as 10 cents on the dollar. An aircraft glut allowed it to 
lease several new MD-80 jetliners at cut rates. Its work force came largely 
from those displaced by the collapse of Midway and other carriers, many of whom 
are earning less than at their former jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno is also borrowing a few ideas from Southwest. It flies only MD-80s, which 
lowers maintenance and repair costs, and it keeps ground time to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Southwest worried? "I'm sure we can compete against any carrier," spokesman 
Ed Stewart said. "Our market share in California has been growing and still is 
growing. We think that's a testament to what the customer is after." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno began to turn a profit within months after it started flying in 1992. 
"The biggest little airline in the world," as it bills itself, was just one of 
several start-ups created to undercut the major airlines where they were 
weakest: in short flights, which produce the least profit, because of lower 
fares and longer downtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The new carrier gained notoriety when it announced plans to fly from Reno to 
Northwest Airlines' home city of Minneapolis. Although Northwest was not flying 
the route, it considered Reno's expansion an incursion on its turf and 
countered by planning more flights not only to Reno but elsewhere on Reno Air's 
flight system. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest backed down, however, under pressure from federal aviation 
authorities. The faceoff lent credibility to Reno Air, not to mention a 
windfall of good publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline has since added planes and destinations in five states, a growth 
cycle that executives hope will continue. The goal: a 50-plane fleet serving 
the entire West. "We ain't there yet," Hydeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno has also had its share of setbacks. The company abandoned service from 
Reno to Kansas City and San Francisco last year -- not to mention those 
ballyhooed flights to Minneapolis -- even as it was building its alliance with 
American. The changes confused travel agents, and traffic tumbled in January, 
when available seats were only half-filled -- well below the break-even point. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Reno Air lost $6.1 million in the quarter ended March 31, on 
operating revenue of $42.4 million. It finished 1993 with a net loss of $7.1 
million -- almost all of it from a fourth-quarter loss -- on revenue of $124.6 
million. The company's stock, which traded as high as $17.75 a share in the 
last year, closed Friday at $4.875, down 12.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Reno restated its earnings for 1992 and one quarter of 1993 after 
questions were raised about some of its accounting practices. That prompted one 
shareholder to file a class-action lawsuit against Reno last week; the company 
said the suit's charges of misconduct had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
 President Robert W. Reding says Reno has bounced back, with passenger loads 
running near or above the break-even point. The company also says it expects 
its fortunes to improve as travel agents and passengers become more familiar 
with its destinations and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry analysts say Reno should be wary of Southwest, which can 
pulverize competitors with fare wars. It was just three years ago, for 
instance, that Southwest drove rivals into a tailspin by pricing its Los 
Angeles-San Francisco route at about $20 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southwest has been able to compete in any market they choose to enter," said 
Lee Howard, president of Airline Economics International, a consulting company 
in Washington. "The secret is to steer clear of competitors who can outlast you 
and out-price you." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Reno is in no position to challenge the dominance of Southwest right 
now, consultant Lowry warned: "They have eroded most of their equity. They are 
undercapitalized. They cannot afford a misstep." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Reno has received high marks from passengers. Some waiting to board 
Reno flights at LAX earlier this month seemed to prefer the smaller carrier to 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 John York, a lighting technician from Irving, Tex., said he appreciated that 
Reno offers credits in American's frequent-flier program. And York, who logs 
about 50,000 air miles a year, can't stand Southwest's open-seating policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't fly Southwest, because I have to have an aisle seat," he said, 
pointing to a bum knee that prevents him from scooting over. 
</P>
<P>
 On Southwest, said Edward Cortese, a retired aerospace engineer from a 
Sacramento suburb, "they get you to move quicker. It's the cattle car 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno and airlines like it will succeed as long as they "don't exhaust their 
ability to perform in their niche or . . . get so impressed with themselves 
that they think they can do it everywhere," said David Stempler, executive 
director of the International Airline Passengers Assn., a Washington trade 
group.  
</P>
<P>
 Hydeman said he's aware of the risk and is trying to keep Reno Air focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to prevent ego cancer from coming into play," he said, "and that 
has been a problem at every airline." Flying Low 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Southwest Airlines thriving while other carriers struggle to imitate 
its success? Largely because Southwest has among the lowest operating costs in 
the industry. Airlines measure efficiency in terms of the cost of flying one 
seat one mile -- the so-called cost per available seat mile, or ASM. By that 
standard, Southwest's costs are the second-lowest among major U.S. carriers. 
ASM costs for the fourth quarter of 1993, in cents:

THE GREENING OF GIVING; BUSINESSES WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL STAKE ARE DONATING TO 
LIKE-MINDED CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The timing couldn't have been worse when the Orange County Marine Institute 
unveiled its $7.5-million building plan in 1990. Southern California's economy 
was in a tailspin; contributions from real estate developers -- long the 
county's main source of philanthropy -- were dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than waiting for developers to regain their financial health, the 
institute started knocking on doors of local companies with strong ties to the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach paid off: During the past three years, the Corona del Mar-based 
Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. has donated more than $80,000 to the 
institute's capital fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution will be blended with other gifts as the institute works 
toward its goal of building a $20-million marine education institute. 
Accountants, lawyers and other companies that work with surf apparel companies 
have also started to make donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting partnership, because without the ocean, the surf industry 
isn't going to survive," said Stan Cummings, executive director of the Marine 
Institute, who senses a growing "awareness in the business community of the 
importance of environmental matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Cummings: "There's less of the 'us and them' mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 As government funding and donations from traditional business sources 
disappear, conservation and environmental advocacy groups such as the Marine 
Institute are increasingly turning to companies that have a vested interest in 
ensuring that surfers, cyclists, hikers and climbers have safe and easy access 
to trails, open space and oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our interest for people to have places to go and enjoy the outdoors," 
said Marianne Jones, a full-time grants administrator for Sumner, Wash.-based 
Recreational Equipment Inc., who processes hundreds of grant requests each 
month. "We want people to have space to use our products, but it has to make 
good business sense. . . . You don't want (corporate directors) questioning why 
you're giving money away." 
</P>
<P>
 Most larger companies are geared up to deal with better-established 
conservation groups that have long track records, such as the Sierra Club or 
the Nature Conservancy, said Pam Maurath, an official with the Environmental 
Grantmakers Assn., a New York-based group that represents 172 businesses and 
nonprofit groups that contribute to various "green" organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller organizations tend to lack the sophistication to make effective 
funding pitches to big, faraway companies. But neighborhood activists have few 
qualms about approaching smaller companies that make products -- surfboards, 
hiking boots, tents -- used outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor clothing and equipment manufacturers responded to the growing number 
of requests by forming an industry group that, like the surf industry 
association, directs funds to grass-roots groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Ventura-based Patagonia and about 40 other outdoor equipment and 
clothing companies created the Conservation Alliance, which has handed out more 
than $1 million in donations. Most of the alliance's grants are for $30,000 or 
less, and all are directed at smaller nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the best work is being done by 10 people gathering around a coffee 
table who want to change something on their block," said Steve Barker, 
president of Eagle Creek Travel Gear in Escondido in San Diego County. "The big 
companies aren't likely to give them any money, because they're not 
sophisticated enough. But a buck takes them a long way, and that's what we 
like. . . . We get a lot of go-power for our money." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Creek Travel Gear is active in its own back yard. The company, which 
makes backpacks and other gear, is supporting a group that is trying to 
preserve what is left of the nearby Escondido Creek's natural habitat. The 
company also helped rescue a local Sierra Club essay contest that was 
endangered by lack of money.  
</P>
<P>
 Conservation Alliance grants, meanwhile, are being used to protect the largest 
remaining unprotected virgin redwood grove in Northern California, to expand 
and maintain hiking trails in the Adirondacks and to support legislators who 
want to remove 12 dams on rivers in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf industry companies are also targeting grass-roots conservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Sportswear in Irvine is donating portions of its Ecology Tees T-shirt 
line to the Surfrider Foundation. Similarly, Freestyle -- a Camarillo sports 
watch manufacturer -- contributes proceeds from the sale of a line of bracelets 
to American Oceans Campaign, a Santa Monica organization that lobbies for 
legislation to protect the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker said the greening of corporate giving is a lifestyle choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still dressing up to go to an opera or symphony fund-raisers 
because it's something that should be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're also trying to help local grass-roots groups that are the most in 
need of funds and are small enough where we can make an impact with our limited 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a significant change for some manufacturers that previously limited 
their support of environmental causes to outfitting high-profile expeditions to 
the Amazon or Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there's "less of the 'me and 75 Sherpas are going to climb a mountain' 
and more of a trend toward people who are volunteering to work on an 
environmental project that truly benefits the ecology," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the driving force behind the surf industry manufacturers' decision to 
fund three Southland organizations working to protect the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the association's fifth annual Waterman's Ball earlier this 
month -- which netted $175,000 -- will support the Marine Institute, the 
American Oceans Campaign and the San Clemente-based Surfrider Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The association raises funds through ticket sales for the gala and an auction 
that includes surfboards, clothing, all-expense-paid trips to idyllic surfing 
spots and -- capitalizing on the industry's strong Hollywood connections -- 
walk-on roles on television shows, including "Coach" and "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Ted Danson, founder and president of American Oceans, is one of the 
association's strongest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do is shine a light on issues," Danson said. "But what these (business 
leaders) are doing is actually responding to the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Danson helped establish American Oceans in 1987 to go head-to-head with big 
oil companies on the volatile issue of offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Association members are excited by one of American Oceans' latest projects: an 
automotive oil recycling program for Los Angeles city residents. Co-sponsored 
by Unocal, the program is designed to intercept the thousands of gallons of 
motor oil dumped into storm drains that empty into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Danson applauded Unocal, usually the target of environmentalists' ire, for its 
willingness to join the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues are so huge that we didn't want to just sit there stuck in a 
brick-throwing mentality," he said. "We've been fighting them for so long that 
we've become friends. . . . We both agreed to sit down and agree on this one 
issue and agree to disagree on other issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Freestyle Vice President Jimmy Olmos said business support for environmental 
causes is, in part, selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us in the surf industry live at or near the beach," Olmos said. "And 
we all have young children. We're realizing that the children love the ocean, 
but it's getting more difficult for them to get into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "And because we're all surfers, we have an extreme passion and desire to help 
the environment. It's nice to get that warm, fuzzy feeling that you're doing 
something . . . but we're also proving that companies do have an ability to 
actually help to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Employers are also making it increasingly easy for employees to make 
environment-minded donations. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 companies with operations in California -- including Wells Fargo 
Bank, Patagonia and REI -- give environmental organizations access to their 
employees' donations through payroll deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, employees in California donated $2.6 million to environmental 
causes through such plans, said Nancy Snow, executive director of Earth Share 
of California, a San Francisco-based nonprofit group that directs donations to 
nearly 90 organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow said fears that traditional payroll deduction favorites -- including 
United Way campaigns -- will be hurt are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every case I'm aware of," she said, "giving goes up when we're added as an 
option."

ECONOMICAL 737: AIRLINE INDUSTRY WORKHORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As more carriers try to match the success of low-cost king Southwest Airlines, 
they're flying an airplane that's already the industry workhorse: the 
economical Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing has delivered more than 2,500 of the squatty-looking planes since their 
debut in 1967, making the 737 commercial aviation's top seller. Another 440 are 
on order at the Boeing plant in Renton, Wash. The aircraft is flown by 159 
airlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest -- the premier no-frills carrier that United, USAir and many others 
are trying to emulate -- has only 737s in its fleet of 170 jetliners. United 
has 227 of the jets in its 547-plane fleet, many of which will be devoted to 
its new low-cost "U-2" service. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-aisle jet -- the smallest of Boeing's family, with a seating 
capacity of 160 -- has long been a plane of choice for carriers serving busy, 
short-distance routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply a very economical airplane to operate," said George Ebbs, 
president of Canaan Group Ltd., a consulting firm in Park City, Utah. "Airlines 
make money with Boeing 737s." 
</P>
<P>
 They like the twin-engine jet's price ($34 million to $42 million new), modest 
maintenance costs, fuel efficiency, reliability and "commonality" -- meaning 
pilots can easily fly different models of the plane, giving airlines more 
scheduling flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Southwest in effect launched Boeing's newest version of the 
plane, the 737-X, when it ordered 63 of the airliners for $2.5 billion. The 
737-X can fly faster and farther than existing 737 models. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Boeing feared the 737 might never recoup its development costs. 
After the Seattle-based company delivered the first 737 to German carrier 
Lufthansa, the plane flew into an economic recession in the late 1960s. 
Although Boeing hoped to sell at least 500 of the jets, fewer than half that 
many had been sold by 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plane slowly picked up momentum, and after the airline industry was 
deregulated in 1978 -- ushering in fierce price competition and a rash of 
low-cost, low-fare competitors that needed reliable, efficient planes -- the 
737's sales gained even more steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's technological world, it's a fairly straightforward, no-frills 
airplane," Ebbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 737's storied history can't shield it from the current aerospace 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Carriers are buying fewer aircraft, and airplane makers have had to cut back 
production and lay off thousands of workers. Boeing has slowed assembly of 
several models, but production is expected to pick up again in the late 1990s.

 Credit unions -- mini financial institutions that boast lower-than-average 
loan interest rates and fees -- are coming to Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of being offered mainly through union, company and specific member 
groups, the National Credit Union Administration has just approved rules that 
could potentially open credit union membership to millions of households -- 
particularly low-income households -- that don't currently have access. 
</P>
<P>
 That's bad news for banks that have seen their market share significantly 
eroded by the explosive growth of credit unions and mutual funds in the past 
several years. But it's great news for consumers, who can often get checking 
accounts and personal loans for a fraction of what they'd pay at banks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth mentioning that bankers are hotly contesting these changes, as well 
as earlier measures that have served to broaden credit union membership over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, credit unions are easier to join than a Tupperware party," complained 
Donald G. Ogilvie, an executive vice president of the American Bankers Assn. in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers group has sued NCUA in an attempt to force credit unions to adhere 
more closely to so-called "common bond" rules that barred millions of Americans 
from access to credit unions in the past. If the bankers are ultimately 
successful, credit union membership would likely plunge. But no one expects 
that to happen for many years -- if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The common bond requirement of credit union membership is, in fact, at the 
heart of the bank-versus-credit-union debate. In the past, credit union 
regulators believed that the federal credit union law, passed in the 1930s, 
required all members of an individual credit union to be members of the same 
group. As a result, credit unions typically restricted their membership to the 
employees of just one company, the staff of a single military base, the members 
of a particular union or the members of a single association. Now, the NCUA 
says "the common bond of credit union membership gives members a sense of 
belonging and ownership and is not meant to limit membership." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the new NCUA rules, which went into effect this month, allow 
low-income groups of all types to join virtually any willing credit union, 
whether established or forming. The low-income members do not need to have any 
common bond with the other members of the established credit union. All they 
would need to qualify is an income of less than 80% of the average household 
income in the United States. In 1994, that makes the qualifying income $25,000, 
according to an NCUA spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing low-income households access to credit unions is pivotal because the 
cost of basic banking accounts has soared in the past few years for those who 
don't have the wherewithal to maintain a minimum balance, says Norman E. 
D'Amours, chairman of the National Credit Union Administration. Additionally, 
bank branches are often absent -- or rare -- in minority and low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main purposes of the change is to facilitate the ability of credit 
unions to serve low-income communities that have been abandoned or never served 
at all by banks," he says. "Historically, credit unions were specifically 
designed to serve people of modest means." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the new rules will allow credit unions that are in "distress" to 
have broad latitude to add occupational and associational groups -- regardless 
of income -- that would otherwise be barred from their roster. This provision 
is specifically being added because a number of military credit unions are 
being threatened by base closures, an NCUA spokeswoman says. These credit 
unions can presumably be kept alive by catering to groups that will remain in 
the base area. 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly is a credit union and why would anyone want to join one? 
</P>
<P>
 Credit unions are nonprofit cooperatives that operate very much like small 
community banks. While each credit union is somewhat different, most offer both 
savings and checking accounts and a variety of consumer loans, including auto 
and credit card loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Deposits made in federally chartered credit unions are insured by the NCUA to 
$100,000. The NCUA is a governmental body, similar to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., which backs bank deposits. It is important to note, however, 
that not all credit unions have NCUA insurance. Roughly 600 state-chartered 
credit unions, mainly in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and Puerto Rico, are privately 
insured. Private deposit insurance does not generally provide the same level of 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes credit unions attractive is simple. Because they're nonprofit and 
their directors are all volunteers, credit unions have lower operating expenses 
than banks. That means they can -- and usually do -- undercut banks on rates 
and fees, while paying somewhat more for deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey conducted last March by the Credit Union National Assn., the 
industry's Madison, Wis.-based trade group, found that the average monthly 
checking account service charge amounted to $2.92 at credit unions and $5.93 at 
banks. About 77% of credit union customers earned interest on their checking 
balances compared with 51% who earned interest on their bank-based checking 
accounts, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit union loan rates were also decidedly better, according to the survey. 
The average credit card interest rate was 13.4% at credit unions versus 17.8% 
at banks. Credit unions were charging an average of 7% for auto loans compared 
with 7.75% at banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Few credit unions offer big-ticket loans, such as mortgages, however. And they 
rarely offer business loans. The fact is that while credit union membership has 
soared over the past dozen years, the bulk of the nation's credit unions are 
fairly small. And their modest size limits both the size of loans they can 
approve and the number of services they can economically offer. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be at the heart of why bankers are fighting the NCUA's new membership 
rules. While small credit unions are not a competitive threat -- they simply 
can't offer a wide enough array of services to accommodate every consumer 
credit need -- the "Godzilla-sized" credit unions that could be created under 
the broadened membership rules could.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; ONE MAN'S VISION; AS AN ARCHITECT, KI SUH PARK KNOWS HOW TO 
BUILD DREAMS. BUT HE HAS DISCOVERED THAT BUILDING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS MUCH 
TRICKIER. AS AN ACTIVIST, HE WORKS NOT ON NEW STRUCTURES BUT ON DEVELOPING AND 
RESTORING COMMON GROUND.

<P>
 Morning's light splinters through the towering atrium of the Los Angeles 
Convention Center. Ki Suh Park -- in suit and tie -- kneels, licks his finger 
and rubs hard at a scuff mark snaking across the terrazzo floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of the center was, in terms of architecture, the most demanding 
project of Park's 33-year career. For more than seven years, it was pure agony, 
he says. But since its opening in 1993, agony has given way to excitement. No, 
he says, it is more than excitement. He stands, breathes deeply and looks up 
into the 150-foot glass canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exhilaration." 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who in 1986 became the first Korean American named to the prestigious 
College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects, is the managing 
partner of Gruen Associates in Los Angeles. The firm, with Pei Cobb Freed & 
Partners in New York, headed the consulting team for the convention center. 
</P>
<P>
 As an architect, Park sees through walls to steel beams and concrete 
foundations the way a doctor sees through skin to bones and tissue. It is with 
the same vision that he views his work for RLA (formerly Rebuild L.A.). There, 
too, he sees through walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the violence, Park surveyed Koreatown on his way from his office 
in West Los Angeles to a meeting in Downtown. He drove without stopping, 
shocked by what he saw. On Western Avenue, he passed Koreatown Plaza, the only 
piece of his work in the community, a building that, he says, "is special in my 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The Plaza escaped serious damage, but its survival did little to console Park 
as he came upon the layer of smoke hanging ghostlike over the city. He had seen 
such destruction, such smoke before, as a young man in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Park's interest in architecture grew not from visions of grand buildings, but 
from the sight of rubble, structures destroyed during the Korean War. As he 
viewed Koreatown, he realized for a second time that someone must rebuild, not 
only the buildings but also the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In Korean culture, a person's 60th birthday is cause for special celebration. 
It marks a rebirth. In 1992, the year of the riots and of Park's 60th, he vowed 
to devote more attention to the needs of his city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our survival and the future of the city depend on it," he says. "The whole 
world lives in this city, and if we can make it happen, this can be the model 
for the future of the entire world." 
</P>
<P>
 This is an uncertain time for Korean Americans, particularly the 
first-generation U.S. citizens. As they look to their native land, they again 
fear the threat of war, heightened by concerns about North Korea's nuclear 
program. And as they look back upon the riots, they see the ashes of the dreams 
that brought them here. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stands beneath the convention center's sheets of tinted glass, like a 
stargazer under a desert sky, Park describes a colleague's recent observation 
that standing in its south lobby is like being outdoors, that from inside one 
can connect with the city and the sky and the trees planted out front. 
</P>
<P>
 "The light is beautiful this time of morning," Park says. 
</P>
<P>
 He walks to the far wall and kneels again. He studies the floor, which doubles 
as a map of the Pacific Rim, then carefully points to a spot. "This," he says, 
"is Pusan." 
</P>
<P>
 It is where his vision began. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength and spirit of a building, like that of a person, arises from 
within and begins with a vision of what might be. When people speak of Park, 
they remark on his ability to see how minute details affect a complicated 
picture, on the way he can look at wreckage and see wondrous possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Park's coming to America is an unlikely story involving war, a letter to the 
Los Angeles Times, a couple from Montebello, a congressman from Indiana, writer 
James Michener, artist Norman Rockwell. And a vision. 
</P>
<P>
 When Park was 6, his father, an agriculture researcher, and mother left Seoul 
to work in the country. They left Park, the second of nine children, with his 
grandparents so he could continue to attend city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a diligent student. Korean schools, reflecting years of Japanese 
colonialism, operated under a system that imposed great competition among 
students. They were seated according to class rank, and Park was always near or 
at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered law school right out of high school, but about two weeks into 
classes his life changed dramatically. He awakened one morning in 1950 to find 
the streets claimed by tanks and Red Army soldiers. Fearful that he would be 
forced into their ranks, Park, then 18, went into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls how, for the next several months, he moved back and forth between 
his aunt's home and grandparents' home, where the furniture had been crammed 
into a back room, leaving a two-foot crawl space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guests are coming." That was the warning his elders would give if soldiers 
approached the house. One day, Park and his older sister were reading when they 
heard their grandmother's voice: "Guests are coming." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his sister scrambled behind the furniture, crouching low to the floor. 
Park heard footsteps. Spotting an open book, Shakespeare written in Japanese, 
on a hallway desk, the soldiers suspected they had interrupted something. Park 
and his sister remained still, afraid to breathe, as the "guests" pushed 
against the furniture. Finally, he heard them go. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, two younger brothers buried themselves in a hay pile, 
narrowly escaping the surging bayonets of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Park volunteered for the South Korean national guard, 
surviving on a diet of salt water and rice for 1 1/2 years. He then managed a 
canteen for the Red Cross in Pusan and, later, worked as a translator for the 
U.S. Joint Advisory Command, also in Pusan. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the destruction of the war, Park decided to become an architect. There 
would be a need for people to rebuild the country. He told soldiers at the 
canteen that he wanted to go to America to become an architect. They encouraged 
him to write letters to U.S. newspapers requesting a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 He mailed three such letters, but only one was published. In May, 1952, the 
Los Angeles Times ran his letter, which was read with interest by Muriel 
McClelland of Montebello. She was touched by Park's words: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am anxious to continue an education in the United States in order to be of 
value to the rebuilding of Korea following cessation of hostilities," he wrote. 
"I am sure that you will readily understand that the present condition of Korea 
requires our younger generation to carry on war to gain final victory at all 
cost against the Red Communists and to concentrate our efforts to aid in the 
rehabilitation of the war-devastated country." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 92 and living in Florida, McClelland recalls that she had just finished 
reading Michener's "Voice of Asia" when she saw the letter. She wrote to the 
author through his publisher, and he responded from his Bucks County, Pa., 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 While Michener, married at the time to an architect, wanted to help, he said 
he could not give money to an individual. Instead, he set up a scholarship fund 
at East Los Angeles Junior College, where Park planned to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jerry Rockwell, a U.S. soldier in Pusan, was also writing letters. 
In one to his father, Norman Rockwell, he told Park's story and asked what 
could be done to help. The artist went to a friend, James Canfield, who agreed 
to be a sponsor. Then-U.S. Rep. Ralph Harvey of Indiana had also heard about 
Park and signed on as a sponsor. With everything in order, Park faced one final 
obstacle: getting here. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers put him on a single-engine military plane bound for Seoul, where he 
could ask his grandfather for air fare. It was Park's second trip on an 
airplane, and he was nervous. His first had been marked by gunfire. For nearly 
10 years, he would have nightmares about being hijacked to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandfather, the first Western-educated doctor in Korea, had money and 
land but preached to young people the importance of earning their own way, as 
he had. But the elder Park, sensing his grandson's desperation, bought him a 
ticket and threw in $80 to get him started in his new life. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 1, 1953, Park arrived in Los Angeles with simple gifts -- silver 
chopsticks and a Chinese scroll. The next day, he began his studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Park stayed with the McClelland family, working around the house after school. 
He would never ask his sponsors for money, and he would never meet Michener or 
Rockwell. But Harvey visited and set up a trip to Washington D.C., where Park 
shook the hands of Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Park was consumed by education, yet he missed his family and homeland. He 
would sometimes mix ketchup and hot sauce and pour it over rice to soothe his 
craving for kim che , a spicy Korean staple. 
</P>
<P>
 After 1 1/2 years of junior college, Park received a scholarship to UC 
Berkeley. He went on to earn separate master's degrees in architecture and city 
planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no trace of bitterness in his voice as he describes mailing resumes 
all over the country after graduation. No one seemed interested, despite his 
outstanding credentials. Finally, in 1961, he landed a job with the firm owned 
by Victor Gruen, who had fled Vienna in 1938 to escape Hitler. In a profession 
dominated by white male power players, Gruen provided opportunities for ethnic 
minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of discrimination," he says. "Nobody wanted to hire me, but I 
ignored it because in the end those who excel will overcome. As I get older, 
that's not good enough. As a group, we must fight discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruen Associates was an egalitarian island, but Park recalls searching for a 
first apartment here with wife Ildong, also a first-generation Korean American, 
whom he had met and married at Berkeley. They would walk up to buildings with 
"For Rent" signs posted, only to be told the unit had been rented. Days later, 
the sign would still be there. 
</P>
<P>
 They eventually found an apartment on Westmoreland Avenue, near Downtown, and 
now have a home in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruen gave Park the chance to practice city planning as well as architecture, 
and he worked with the same intensity he showed as a student. In 1968, he 
became a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Mayne, managing partner at the Morphosis architectural firm in Santa 
Monica, worked with Park in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very demanding, very rigorous," Mayne says. "For a period there, he 
went through about a jillion secretaries. . . . I would write memos and he 
would send them back to me with corrections." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Park says, he is demanding, circumspect. He still edits memos. He still 
believes he can accomplish more today than he did yesterday, and that has been 
his driving force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had such faith in the future," he says, "faith that if I work really hard 
and do my best, opportunity will open up for me, and that's what attracted me 
to come to this country. I still believe in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to America changed Park. Since leaving Korea in 1953, he had become an 
architect, a husband and father. Almost without realizing it, he had become 
American. Park decided against returning to South Korea and in 1966 became a 
U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, he was named a partner at Gruen, and nine years later became the 
firm's managing partner. At the recent national convention of the American 
Institute of Architects at the L.A. Convention Center, Park became the first 
Korean American to receive the Whitney M. Young Jr. Citation, in honor of the 
late civil rights leader who in 1968 challenged architects to assume 
professional responsibility toward social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are not things he mentions when discussing his accomplishments. What 
he is most proud of are the three sons he raised with Ildong, who worked for 10 
years as a research associate at UCLA Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
 David, 34, graduated from UCLA and Boston College Law School. He is a 
litigation attorney here. Kevin, 27, graduated from Harvard, studied at Oxford 
University and this month graduated from Harvard Medical School. Edwin, 22, 
also graduated this month, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public 
Administration and International Affairs at Princeton University. He will 
attend Harvard Law School. Including Ki Suh, the family of five includes three 
Phi Beta Kappas. 
</P>
<P>
 As Park has grown older, he has come to learn that his children and 
granddaughter are the measure of his success, the source of strength and spirit 
that rises from within. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you know where you are in the ocean unless you have a benchmark?" 
</P>
<P>
 One must have a reference point, Park says, a place from which to decide where 
to go. To work hard, to struggle, is to swim in circles unless one has 
bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand other people, and the problems they face, one must practice 
empathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to do that is to really listen to you," Park says, "to 
understand how you thought, the process you went through, why you did what you 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1969, he embarked on a 25-year project that would teach him a 
lesson and change his life: planning and designing the Century Freeway from Los 
Angeles International Airport to Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 It would disrupt the lives of many people who lived along the corridor. During 
numerous public hearings, the residents described the harm it would do to their 
communities. About 21,000 people were ultimately displaced by the 17-mile 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to look through my eyes on everything, form an opinion from my eyes," 
he says, "but I learned that you really have to have empathy for other people, 
how they see the same thing," Park says of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Empathy became a word he used often. He cannot drive the freeway, which 
finally opened last year, without seeing the good, the people it serves, as 
well as the bad, the lives adversely affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benefit is great, but there are thousands of people who got hurt in the 
process. That's part of the process. Our public policy has to be compassionate 
to take care of those who are unduly hurt. That absolutely has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Park is credited with routing the freeway to minimize its impact and helping 
to create programs, including job training, to assist displaced residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a leader in that regard," says Charles O'Connell, L.A. deputy district 
director of Caltrans. "He heightened everyone's sensitivities concerning the 
role of government in being a sensible partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Park brought together residents with elected and government officials to 
discuss the project. He encouraged them to listen, to find a benchmark in the 
ocean. During the freeway planning process, he began to shed his diffident 
nature. Previously reluctant to express his views, he opened up and became less 
self-conscious about his accent, more confident in himself. He learned that 
what you say is more important than how you say it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it comes from your heart, that's what matters most. To feel empathy 
doesn't mean that you are more interested in what other people feel than what 
you feel yourself. I value my ideas, my perspectives as much as anybody else's. 
You have to have your own ideas, otherwise you are nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days of Rebuild L.A., when tensions were high and fingers were 
being pointed, Park was instrumental in creating a constructive atmosphere as 
co-chair of the Racial Harmony and Discourse Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stressed that it was so important to be able to step inside the other 
person," co-chair Marilyn Solomon says. "His attitude and style and sensitivity 
surfaced quietly but with determination and a clear-eyed sense of what was 
appropriate to ease tensions." 
</P>
<P>
 When the family of Latasha Harlins, a black youth killed in 1991 by a Korean 
American store owner, formed a foundation and approached the group about 
turning the store into a community center, Park persuaded the mortgage holders 
to meet with the family. The Korean bankers agreed to give them time to raise 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA is one step toward racial harmony, Park says, but the journey is long, and 
there are many walls. Beyond them, he sees hope. That, too, is part of his 
vision. Racial harmony is mandatory for economic vitality, he says. It is not 
only a humane goal but fundamental to restoring confidence in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA was formed in the aftermath of the 1992 civil unrest to enhance economic 
development and create jobs in neglected areas. About one-half of the 
structures sustaining major damage during the disturbance were owned by ethnic 
Koreans, says Linda Griego, RLA president and CEO. And of the 10,000 people who 
applied for emergency Small Business Administration assistance, nearly half had 
Korean surnames. 
</P>
<P>
 Park is frustrated that, despite all the words that were spoken, many victims 
have been neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Koreans have made substantial contributions in this city, but look what 
happened during the civil disturbance," he says. "We didn't get help from 
anywhere. That shows you we have to generate a voice. We not only have to work 
within our community, we also have to work with other ethnic groups to build 
strong alliances and develop common ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who chairs the Korean American Coalition, believes that Korean Americans 
were targeted during the violence and continue to be misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a stereotype that Koreans come here with money and go into the poorer 
neighborhoods and take the blood out of them, put nothing back in. That's 
simply not true," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the negative attention has centered on Korean-owned liquor stores in 
black communities. Some have charged that the proprietors are greedy, rude and 
refuse to hire locals. Others say there are simply too many liquor stores in 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's right or wrong," Park says, "but if the community thinks 
that the abundance of liquor stores is hurting community interests, then the 
public or city should work toward reducing the number. If so, proper 
compensation should be given to the current liquor store owners." 
</P>
<P>
 RLA is asking Korean business owners whose liquor stores were destroyed to 
consider opening grocery markets. Some may make the change, many have moved, 
and others will never reopen. More than 300 buildings citywide remain vacant 
and face demolition.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," Park says, "I feel like a tiny grain of sand. But you can't 
remake the world overnight or remake the city overnight. The question is: Are 
we even taking the first step?" 
</P>
<P>
 But even a tiny grain of sand can be a benchmark in the ocean, and Park knows 
from his own life that work and faith and vision make many things possible. And 
from moments of agony come moments of excitement.  
</P>
<P>
 No, not excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhilaration. Ki Suh Park 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Native? No. Born in Korea, lives in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married for 37 years to Ildong Park; three grown sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Helping the city to achieve peace. 
</P>
<P>
 On working toward racial harmony: "Our survival and the future of the city 
depend on it. The whole world lives in this city, and if we can make it happen, 
this can be the model for the future of the entire world." 
</P>
<P>
 On job discrimination in the early '60s: "Nobody wanted to hire me, but I 
ignored it because in the end those who excel will overcome. As I get older, 
that's not good enough. As a group, we must fight discrimination and make sure 
some of the things that have happened in this society are minimized."  
</P>
<P>
 On his drive to succeed: "I had such faith in the future, faith that if I work 
really hard and do my best, opportunity will open up for me. And that's what 
attracted me to come to this country. I still believe in that." 
</P>
<P>
 On his approach to a difficult problem: "I used to look through my eyes on 
everything, form an opinion from my eyes. But I learned that you really have to 
have empathy for other people, how they see the same thing."

HOME ALONE AFTER HOME IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I sat at the kitchen table, opened my checkbook and smiled sadly at him. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd put this off for as long as I could, but by now he'd scraped, puttied and 
stuccoed everything in sight and it had come to this: I had to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted the check, shook my hand and showed himself out. A moment later 
the door of his truck slammed and he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 God, I thought. I miss my contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I met Juan through friends. He'd built a meticulously detailed 
addition to their Southwestern adobe house. He was perfectly suited to build us 
an adobe office and guest house. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan was a yuppie homeowner's dream. With his graying beard, wire rims and 
button-down dress shirts, he looked more like a professor than a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a cherubic smile, a Colombian accent that had stuck after 20 years in 
the States and the calm, can-do manner of an airline pilot. He inspired 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan also never seemed to get dirty. I usually look like I've undergone a 
Hell's Angels induction when I finish a home project, so I figured he had to be 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 He was always cheerful, but we could tell when Juan disliked a design idea: 
He'd nod and say, "huunh ," his voice rising with his lack of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 There came a cold, rainy day in early March when Juan showed up with his 
workers. That was the last day I got any work done for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 As a free-lance writer working alone at home, I've mastered the usual 
distractions. I can face down the refrigerator, the CD player and the latest 
issue of People and return to my computer. 
</P>
<P>
 But here was a new obstacle to productivity: other humans. 
</P>
<P>
 All day, as workmen hammered and sawed, I felt compelled to see what they were 
up to. 
</P>
<P>
 I lingered as they poured a foundation and laid adobes. I snapped pictures 
while they framed the roof, telling myself I was only seeing that the job got 
done right. 
</P>
<P>
 But it went deeper. I was hanging with Handy Guys, guys who could do things -- 
guys who could make things. Their weathered faces spoke of a life lived 
outdoors, like men were supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
 One day 19-year-old Victor Jr., the youngest worker, confided that he hoped to 
attend college, saying: "I don't want to be working for minimum wage the rest 
of my life." So much for romantic illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan and I sometimes drove around in his truck, having adventures. Once we ran 
out of gas on the interstate. Another time, I got to help unload a semi-trailer 
full of table tops for a Subway sandwich shop he was building. 
</P>
<P>
 And we talked. About his coming to America. About his father, who'd fled the 
Holocaust and started an auto import business in Colombia. About his sons, and 
his wife the lawyer, with whom he shared easy laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 It dawned on me that this was no mere business transaction. This was a 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 So I tried not to let him down. 
</P>
<P>
 I was proud the morning he surveyed the straight, even brick floor my wife and 
I had laid and said, "This looks really good!" 
</P>
<P>
 It felt like passing a test. 
</P>
<P>
 Now life is back to normal. I endure the peace and quiet and get my work done. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately we think the house needs a lighter stucco. The roof could use some 
new sheet metal too. And my wife wants to rebuild the bathroom and install a 
skylight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Juan, wherever you are, we need you.

CAROLE MASO: DANCING ON A LITERARY EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLOTTE INNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before Carole Maso begins to read, it is impossible not to pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 She wears a dazzling pink and gold shawl, a diaphanous blue and yellow dress, 
brilliant red lipstick on her sensuous mouth. Her pale hair shines almost 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
 When she reads, all becomes clear. She is the living embodiment of her prose 
-- a two-hour explosion of verbal heat, light and color. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very visceral experience," says a slightly stunned Matthew Krout, 
a recent UCLA graduate, as he waits in line to buy Maso's book after the 
reading, one of the Lannan Foundation's Readings and Conversations series 
hosted by KCRW's Michael Silverblatt at the Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I have to be in shape for this," says Lisi Rona, a Los Angeles 
poet. "She's very fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the excited reactions Maso has been getting on her 10-city tour to 
promote her latest novel, "The American Woman in a Chinese Hat," and to read 
from "Bay of Angels," a work in progress. Her readings have also inspired love 
letters and post-reading propositions, Maso says. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Maso may not have the name recognition of Danielle Steel -- she says 
she'd hate that kind of fame -- but among literati, she is on the cutting edge. 
Critics say she epitomizes all that is great about American literature today -- 
and all that is wrong with major American publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 They ignore her. 
</P>
<P>
 This is nothing new, of course. Raymond Carver struggled in obscurity for 
years before being hailed as a master of the minimalist form -- although he is 
perhaps more widely known as the inspiration behind the film "Short Cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Maso may well be the next Carver. Published by small literary presses, she is 
gaining a reputation for reshaping language and form in unique, beautiful, 
experimental yet totally readable ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, she received a $50,000 fellowship from the Los Angeles-based Lannan 
Foundation, which honors "writers of distinctive literary merit who demonstrate 
potential for outstanding future work." Her novels "Ghost Dance," "The Art 
Lover," "AVA" and now "The American Woman in the Chinese Hat" have received 
lavish praise from reviewers and writers in every genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving and wonderful, and highly readable," says Stephen Koch, author of the 
nonfiction book "Double Lives" and chairman of the graduate writing division of 
the School of the Arts at Columbia University in New York, which recently hired 
Maso as a faculty member. He added that she's a dynamic teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such plaudits, Maso is not widely known. But many writers say "The 
American Woman in the Chinese Hat" may introduce her work to a much wider 
readership, including the very loyal audience of gay and bisexual readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Maso's earlier works contained gay characters, this is her first 
novel to focus on the erotic life of a bisexual woman. The strong turnout for 
her other Los Angeles reading -- in the Lesbian Writers Series sponsored by A 
Different Light in West Hollywood -- was proof of an audience hungry for good, 
literary explorations of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the south of France, "The American Woman" concerns a beautiful writer, 
Catherine, recovering from her breakup with her lesbian lover of many years and 
the death of her older brother from AIDS. She numbs her pain with one brief 
erotic encounter after another, mostly with women, until she meets a man, 
Lucien, whom she senses to be her match in beauty, pain and emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it seems. For this book works on many levels. Most importantly, Maso 
tracks with horrifying authenticity the downward spiral of Catherine's 
depression, pulling you in, like Carver, with prose that is terse, musical and 
hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Maso calls "The American Woman" her most accessible and her 
most autobiographical book yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this was mirroring a very dark and bleak time in my life, and that I 
had no other way to get by, except to try to speak about this," she says in the 
same clear, lilting voice that wraps seductively around the mind at readings. 
</P>
<P>
 She started writing the novel in France in 1988 on a $20,000 National 
Endowment for the Arts grant. But depression made it increasingly difficult for 
her to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was she grieving the death from AIDS of a close friend, Gary Falk -- 
the model for characters in "The Art Lover" and "The American Woman" -- she was 
also, like her heroine, breaking up with her longtime companion, Helen Lang, a 
financial analyst for the Legal Aid Society in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was monogamy: Lang was for it; Maso wasn't. The two, who met at 
Vassar, have since reunited, and Maso says their relationship is now a central 
stable element in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like her heroine, she's sexually attracted to men, but she prefers women and 
identifies herself as a lesbian. Only once did she briefly consider a 
conventional heterosexual marriage-and-children route, until the man she was 
seeing told her that he wasn't sure he could handle the fact that she was the 
better writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since then, I've never been seduced toward that kind of life," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line on every decision is, "Will it help my work?" she says. "My 
work keeps me well, keeps me whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many great writers, from Virginia Woolf to Ernest Hemingway, Maso suffers 
from an inherited manic depression. When she feels well, there's a kind of 
electrical charge "surging through the brain. It's a mysterious thing, which 
you have to harness, of course, but it is there, and it is what I work off." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside of the illness challenges her to write about the barely 
describable experiences of madness and death. In France, even at her worst, she 
forced herself daily to jot things down in her notebook, to record how it felt. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes what emerges is very joyous, like "AVA," stylistically her most 
daring book, about a woman who has lived life to the hilt and is now dying. The 
book recounts her thoughts on the last day of her life -- disconnected, 
repetitive, randomly forming into patterns and then drifting away, as thoughts 
do. Maso wrote it after she had recovered from her experience in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're at a place of that much darkness, the light is blinding when you 
come back," Maso says. 
</P>
<P>
 Happiness and despair have alternated throughout her 38 years. Growing up in 
Wyckoff, N.J., the oldest of five children, Maso was always considered gifted 
by her parents, and they gave her the sense that she could "do anything. It was 
the greatest thing I got from them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, there have been the years of unwanted but life-sustaining 
jobs, such as waitressing, that bought Maso time to write. She hit bottom on 
the way home in New York one night when a mugger threw down her bag of tips in 
disgust because it wasn't "real money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What left her most bitter, though, were editors who told her repeatedly to 
rewrite her work in a traditional narrative format. One wanted her to take 
everything out of her first book, "Ghost Dance," except the mother-daughter 
relationship -- deleting about three-quarters of the book. "Mother-daughter was 
hot" that year, she says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews and essays, and in her role as fiction editor for the highly 
regarded Kenyon Review, Maso has blasted everyone involved in mainstream 
publishing -- from corporations in it only for the money to "whorish" writers 
who contour their styles to match the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Maso's starving-in-the-garret years are over, at least temporarily. The 
Lannan money enabled Maso and Lang to buy a house -- a 150-year-old, three 
bedroom Colonial on 3 1/2 acres near Hudson, N.Y. It's a far cry from the tiny 
Greenwich Village apartment they share with their cats, Fauve and Coco. 
</P>
<P>
 The money also brought new creative freedom, Maso says. And that's evident in 
the ecstatic style of her novel in progress, "Bay of Angels," which focuses on 
Aunt Sophie, a character from "AVA," just before she's shot at the Nazi death 
camp at Treblinka. Another bleak theme, but the prose glows and pulses with 
life in what sounds like a cross between poetry and the Bible's Book of 
Revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 Maso considers her talent a gift from somewhere outside her control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very humble in the face of this thing that I do," she says. "That's 
what it's about for me. It's not about money. It's not about any kind of 
notoriety. And that's so nice -- to be free."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; AMERICA'S PASSION PLAY; THE UNITED STATES' SURPRISING 
SUCCESS IN THE FIRST ROUND HAS ALLOWED ITS FANS A CHANCE TO FEEL THE HEAT THAT 
IS SYNONYMOUS WITH WORLD CUP COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Channel surfers are zapping from the weather in Denver to the financial ticker 
to "Little House on the Prairie" reruns and are stopping to watch corner kicks 
and wondering when Alexi Lalas is going to host "MTV Unplugged." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, there seems to be room on talk radio for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 True passion doesn't necessarily bloom overnight and no one expects U.S. stock 
markets to close during World Cup games, like they did in Brazil. But soccer 
left the stadium and joined pop culture, at least temporarily, when the United 
States defeated Colombia, 2-1, on Wednesday in the first round of the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Any forecast on whether the U.S. soccer team will set off a spark that turns 
into the vibrant flame that exists almost everywhere else in the world is 
premature and presumptuous, of course. But World Cup '94 already has surpassed 
its pre-tournament billing as another sporting contest that was being force-fed 
to a reluctant public and recalcitrant media. 
</P>
<P>
 "The masses have it and they want it and they are doing it, but I'm not sure 
if the power structure is quite there," said Martha Lopez-Garza, a sociology 
professor at Occidental College. "I'm not convinced yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Power structures, in this case possible sponsors, advertising executives and 
the media, might rely on raw data, but passion and emotion aren't easily 
measured, not always fitting into neat little categories on flow charts. No one 
was on hand to poll the fans who staged a spur-of-the-moment celebration 
Wednesday night at a Yorba Linda gas station when goalkeeper Tony Meola and 
defender Marcelo Balboa stopped for a bathroom break on their way back to Dana 
Point, serenading them with cheers of "U-S-A! U-S-A!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the fans with patriotic makeup -- red, white and blue faces -- 
clad in flags, wandering the streets of Pasadena, slowing traffic long after 
the game ended on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about the afterglow lasting through the rest of the week. Lalas combed 
through a pile of fan mail on Friday while doing interviews. At the team's 
resort hotel in Dana Point, a solid line of television trucks lined the 
entrance on Thursday. The proliferation of satellite dishes made the parking 
area look like a mushroom farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were more one-on-one interviews in one day than in the last 15 months 
combined," said agent Leigh Steinberg, who is representing the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic, a man of the world in the truest sense, has been 
getting calls in every language. Except he is trying to convince some of his 
friends that, yes, the Americans did win, 2-1. No, it was not a misprint.  
</P>
<P>
 In Dallas, officials of soccer's governing body, FIFA, were stunned. Already, 
the warm reception the World Cup has received in the United States had allayed 
FIFA's fears that Americans would not give the event its due respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in football 19 years as an executive, and I have never (seen) 
this feeling of emotion, and the awareness of our games as we've had in the 
United States," said Joseph Blatter, secretary general of FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 "They proved that this game has a right to have its place in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the victory, Chief Sebastian Babatunde Williams of Nigeria 
still could not believe what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now (Americans) started reacting to it," he said. "And they are enjoying it. 
I see the expression on their faces. When I get in a cab, the driver wants to 
talk about soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Said World Cup '94 chairman Alan Rothenberg: "The response has been 
overwhelming. People are walking by and high-fiving us as we're traveling 
around, getting in and out of cabs and at airports." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg pointed out the importance of today's game against Romania from a 
television standpoint, since it is on ABC, and is only days after the upset of 
Colombia. Wednesday's U.S.-Colombia game drew a 4.3 national Nielsen rating for 
ESPN. In contrast, Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals between the New York 
Rangers and the Vancouver Canucks drew a 5.2. But ESPN's opening-day baseball 
game between the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals received a 4.1, the 
cable network's best rating of the season for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack O'Hara, executive producer of ABC sports, refused to make any predictions 
for today's U.S.-Romania game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refused to make any ratings guesses before the World Cup and I'm glad I did 
because I would have been way off," he said. "But I will say it should be a 
huge rating. All the conditions are right. It's a Sunday afternoon game facing 
little competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Garza of Occidental has students who were passionate about soccer long 
before this World Cup tournament and could get their fix only from 
Spanish-language Univision. Some were from places such as Armenia and Cameroon 
and didn't care if they couldn't understand a word during the games. (Univision 
drew a 19.1 rating among its households for the U.S.-Colombia game). 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world plays," she said. "Soccer in the United States was almost 
like the way we treated the metric system. We resisted it when it came up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very active sport. It doesn't seem to be as violent as some sports, 
especially for kids. It's a lot more exciting than baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a society, we like to be ahead. We don't like to be last on the bus or 
last at a party. We said, 'It's not our game. Everybody else is already doing 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate and media resistance to soccer in the United States was noticeable 
before the World Cup landed here. Guillermo Canedo of Mexico, FIFA's senior 
vice president, recalled when only he and Joao Havelange of Brazil, FIFA's 
president, supported the idea of bringing the World Cup finals to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old people didn't believe football could make it here," said Canedo, 
chairman of the World Cup finals organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone had reason to be skeptical, it was Canedo, a former part-owner of 
the Los Angeles Aztecs and the San Diego Toros, now defunct professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we knew exactly what could happen," Canedo said. "Americans understand 
this sport like people in my country. How many millions of Americans are from 
Europe and the Americas? The immigration is tremendous. These people are going 
to fill these stadiums and bring their American friends. They are going to be 
the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the next league begins, well, that is the moment for change in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg likes to say that the real job begins July 18, the day after the 
World Cup final. Blatter and his colleagues campaigned vigorously to boost the 
U.S. national team and bring soccer to America. They have been frustrated for 
years because millions of American youth played the sport, then dropped out of 
sight before ever buying a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Now optimism is replacing frustration and FIFA believes soccer has reached a 
crossroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not like some American commentators have said, it is not a one-time 
event," Blatter said. "It is a legacy, not a two-day circus. One half hour 
after the match (at the Rose Bowl), people were still in the stadium cheering. 
We have seen the United States play with such a fighting spirit, it is such a 
tremendous thing to see. They produce such an emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions spilled over in the Rose Bowl stands, too. Generally, the crowd was 
well behaved and Colombians and Americans seemed to get along. Once it became 
clear that the United States had a decent chance of carving out a bit of soccer 
history, the mood got tense in one section, according to Al Mistri, who is the 
soccer coach at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a fight in the section behind my wife," he said. "I'm not sure what 
exactly happened, but someone got in a Colombian's face. It's not the kind of 
thing you like to see at a game. But at least someone finally gives a hoot 
about soccer. I feel proud. It felt really good to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of passion that only this game can produce." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the passion will play out at the Rose Bowl. Wednesday might very well 
have been the highlight of the '94 World Cup tournament, but now the 
expectation level has been raised with the U.S. performance. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the chances of the passion staying alive after the World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that this has helped propel us up," Mistri said. "I may 
not see it. You may not see it. But your children will see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Wednesday, I would have said no."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; 'AMERICATOWN' SHOWS UP; HOST COUNTRY HAS DONE A FINE JOB OF 
PROVIDING THE ANTISEPTIC VENUES, BUT IT'S THE IMMIGRANTS WHO GIVE THIS 
COMPETITION ITS CULTURE AND PASSION

<P>
 Who are these people? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question we have asked ourselves, time and again, during the often 
dazzling first week of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 We have asked it while watching a craggy-faced Irishman weep. 
</P>
<P>
 We have asked it while watching a young Mexican drape a red, white and green 
flag around his shoulders and begin singing in the middle of a crowded subway 
car, a song carried up to the street by hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 We have asked it while standing amid hundreds of Argentines underneath the 
stands at Foxboro Stadium. Their country had defeated Greece an hour earlier, 
yet they refused to leave, beating drums and bouncing on the concrete, anthems 
tumbling from their mouths like Sunday morning alleluias. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these people filling our major stadiums with this unrecognizable 
passion? 
</P>
<P>
 Before this week, Washington's RFK Stadium reminded us of Redskins and Cowboys 
and a few fans daring enough to dress up as hogs. 
</P>
<P>
 But now we have seen it filled with thousands of Norwegians wearing horned 
caps and lighting flares, and we will never see it the same way again. 
</P>
<P>
 We are used to seeing the Foxboro Stadium field covered with snow, not 
confetti and streamers. We are used to hearing piped-in music, not 
deep-throated songs about patriotic dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 In a World Cup that has so far thrilled fans, delighted advertisers and 
surprised skeptics, this is the question that dominates: 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these people? 
</P>
<P>
 After spending a week being jostled around upper decks that feel like foreign 
lands, we have come to a conclusion that should not surprise, but does: 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, these people are us. 
</P>
<P>
 They are waiters from New Jersey, students from South Dakota, nannies from 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 They are U.S. residents and citizens who came here from other places for 
education and opportunity. They have paid our taxes and fought in our wars. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are people with long memories, people with roots we sometimes do not 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, several thousand fans at each game are foreign tourists, having 
flown here from distant countries for a chance to cheer their favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
 We were prepared for them. We knew we would be playing host to 5,000 Irish 
from Dublin, 20,000 Brazilians from Rio, not to mention all that Saudi royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But what we forgot were the 60,000 Irish from New York. And the thousands of 
Greeks from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Italians from Providence, R.I., who have lived here 25 years or more, 
yet still tremble upon hearing the national anthem of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 We forgot that this melting pot in which we live still contains thick, rich 
chunks of international passion. 
</P>
<P>
 We forgot about Norma Cornejo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was midway through the second half of the game between Argentina and 
Greece. The stands inside Foxboro Stadium were full. But some of the most 
heartfelt cheering was coming from outside the front gates. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in a spitting rain, her face pressed against a fence, was Cornejo. 
Behind her, crowding for a better look, stood three relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the chain link, between the heads of security guards, they could see 
the game being played on the big-screen video scoreboard at the far end of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 They could not afford to pay scalpers $250 a ticket. But that didn't stop 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can see a little of the game, we can feel the crowd, it is enough," 
Cornejo said. 
</P>
<P>
 A factory worker from Buenos Aires? Not quite. Cornejo works for a stock 
brokerage in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family has been in this country for 21 years, more than half of her life, 
yet she still stays awake past 1 a.m. to watch the Argentines play soccer on a 
Spanish-language station. 
</P>
<P>
 She took two vacation days for the long drive to Massachusetts, a trip that 
fell just short of allowing her to see her heroes in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family's cheers could barely be heard above the noise of trash removers 
and golf carts and passing cars. A group of teen-age boys gathered behind them, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 But then national icon Diego Maradona scored in the 60th minute, and those 
cheers become screams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornejo family hugged and danced in the rain and swirling trash. Two other 
women from Argentina, one of them a U.S. resident, joined the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Then those six people, standing outside a stadium in a country that knows 
little about soccer, began singing an anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance workers and security guards stopped to stare. Nearby policemen 
shook their heads, then chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 And that ominous pack of teens? 
</P>
<P>
 They began chanting, earnestly, "Ar-gen-tin-a! Ar-gen-tin-a!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in the United States. I love the United States," said Christina 
Urrutia, a recent immigrant who teaches in Columbus, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 She pats her heart over her orange poncho. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the flag of Argentina will always live in here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these people? 
</P>
<P>
 They are Los Angeles resident Fernando Lima, 37, who recently drove to Palo 
Alto with his head shaved and painted in the Brazilian colors of green and 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hair will come back after the World Cup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Guy Bavaro, a computer consultant from Manhattan who has lived in 
this country for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game between Italy and Ireland, Bavaro was spotted in the Giants 
Stadium parking lot holding a flag and singing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a Vietnam veteran, yet the flag was Italian. So were the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've been in this country a long time, but I want to keep alive my 
heritage, my culture," Bavaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few moments, like thousands of other Italian-Americans, he was watching 
his national team in person for the first time in his adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to cry like a baby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these people? 
</P>
<P>
 One sociologist says they are people who have too long been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of this country being a melting pot is jargon, it's a myth," 
said Jay Coakley, sociology professor at the University of Colorado in Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who immigrate here, they do not forget about their roots that 
quick," he said. "Like our citizens who move to other countries, these people 
subscribe to the papers from their hometowns, they talk on the phone to friends 
back home, they stay in touch for two and three generations." 
</P>
<P>
 The results, Coakley said, can be seen in the stands at the nine World Cup 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have ignored our ethnic diversity to the point where we forget it's 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even this country's soccer leaders had forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 In addressing worries about crowd control, World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg 
recently said, "Hey, the average people attending these games is going to be a 
family of four from the suburbs." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of games involving the United States, he has been terribly 
mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 The "suburbs" have been Little Italy, Greektown, Koreatown. These are places 
we visit for food and entertainment, scarcely pausing to realize that somebody 
lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is in these neighborhoods that a lot of people in this country gain a 
reaffirmation of who they are," Coakley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Granero, a waiter from New Jersey, has lived here 25 years. That was him 
in the upper deck at Foxboro, draped in a blue and white Argentina flag, 
leading a chant of "Let's go, champions!" in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "During our anthem, my hair stood up," he said, turning to a reporter. "Right 
now, I feel like kissing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Even knowing who these people are, we are still bothered. There is something 
else we need to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't we feel what they feel? 
</P>
<P>
 When is the last time somebody refused to leave Foxboro stadium after a New 
England Patriots' game? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it is about playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing soccer since I was 5, on my street," said Vasilis Adamakos, 
47, who flew here from Greece for the games. "I wanted to a be a soccer hero, 
nothing else. Where I live, everybody feels that way. Nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do they feel that way here?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, not about soccer, not about any one sport. We have too many organized 
sports for our children to ever grow up with a unified passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in other countries, professional sports here compete not just with each 
other, but with college sports. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sports we do care about? They are run by businesses, fueled by 
corporate sponsorships, littered with athletes who no longer look or talk like 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 In other countries, soccer is a sport of the people. By the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, these players are not idols," said Cornejo. "These are our neighbors. 
They are like part of our family." 
</P>
<P>
 Coakley, who recently returned from an assignment in England, noted, "Soccer 
teams in other places represent defined social classes, social areas, local 
clubs that are more than 100 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "There is no big TV revenue, so these teams are supported by the 
people directly. Here, you have a team moving from Baltimore to Indianapolis 
and being hyped by Budweiser." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of our differences remain too deep and vast to describe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watch both the Spanish and English World Cup telecasts at home, and my 
sons keep asking me the same thing," said Milton Jamail, professor of Latin 
American Studies at the University of Texas. "They said, 'Dad, why does the 
Spanish announcer say, "Goal-l-l-l-l-l,' and the English one just says, 'Goal?' 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I tell them? I just say it's passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing a lack of such passion, the rest of the world said the United States 
did not deserve to have a World Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But it forgot who we were. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, so did we.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; COMMENTARY; IF THIS KEEPS UP, HOT-STOVE SOCCER ISN'T FAR 
BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It is one week into the World Cup, and people all over the country are talking 
about soccer. I'll repeat that. People are talking about soccer . 
</P>
<P>
 These are people apparently of sound mind and body, such as the two Marines 
waiting for a flight at Ontario Airport on Thursday. There were discussing how 
Switzerland versus Colombia today will impact Group A standings. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, two Marines. Didn't Marines used to talk about football or 
boxing? 
</P>
<P>
 There's no denying it. We are a country, at least for the moment, infatuated 
with the sport of one-name stars and flag-waving fans. We might not have quite 
caught soccer fever yet, but our faces are a little flush and we're feeling 
warm around the temples. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Alexi Lalas' goatee, there have been some amazing sights this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The national convention of the Associated Press Sports Editors began in Dana 
Point on Wednesday, the same day as the shocking, heartwarming U.S. victory 
over Colombia at the Rose Bowl. At an early evening reception for the sports 
editors, who come from all over the country, all TV sets were turned to the 
soccer game -- even after the start of the seventh game of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 American sports editors have long been accused of being the main reason for 
the continuing failure of soccer in this country. They don't know the sport, 
and thus they hate it, soccer people say. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at least for the moment, many of these same sports editors are like the 
famous TV cereal ad about Mikey. They like it. Hey, Alan Rothenberg, they like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the timing of the U.S. stunner over Colombia couldn't have been 
better. Soccer not only had a great moment, but had it head to head with an 
American sports institution like the NBA. And lived to tell about it. Hell, 
live to shout with delight about it. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be, in retrospect, that Patrick Ewing, John Starks and their 
remarkable sledgehammer shooting touch contributed greatly to the magical 
moment for U.S. soccer. Many people watched the soccer game because, comparing 
it to the Knicks, they figured they would see more scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 So much has already happened this first week. 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen five penalty-kick goals. 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen the other team score a goal for the United States -- muchas gracias 
, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen a near-goal bicycle kick by U.S. defender Marcelo Balboa against 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 And we've seen, perhaps, a new category of immigration -- call it the 
immigration of necessity -- up-coming for the young Colombian Oscar Cordoba, 
who scored the goal against his country. This could mark the first time anybody 
has been anxious to move to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, we, as a fledgling soccer-viewing nation, have now matured so that, 
after one week, we can walk past one of those foreign-language World Cup 
telecasts, hear the announcer call a GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL, and not immediately 
call for medical help. The last human able to hold his breath that long was 
Lloyd Bridges in "Sea Hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 We've also learned about soccer hairdos and their respective impacts. We know 
that Valderrama's sells, but doesn't do much in games; that Tony Meola's must 
actually be black paint; that Alexi Lalas' plays beautifully and that Cobi 
Jones' doesn't play at all until about the 70th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, we've learned that this is kind of fun, that the summer sun does not 
have to rise and set on last night's one-hitter or next month's arrival of 
punters and kickers at Oxnard and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 We've certainly learned that Brazil and Pele no longer have a patent on 
single-name sports heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Right, Bora?

WORLD CUP USA 1994; IS THE WAIT OVER FOR U.S. SOCCER?; FANS: LONGTIME FOLLOWERS 
OF THE SPORT REWARDED AS THE U.S. TEAM'S SUCCESS BEGETS AN INCREASE IN 
POPULARITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Imagine voting for Ross Perot every year. Still renting Beta tapes. Owning 
solar stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine you once fell hard for something that never achieved massive 
popularity, and all you've heard since are stifled chuckles from those who 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the long suffering of American soccerphiles, the lifers, the fans who 
were already fans as far back in ancient soccer history as the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, when Ernie Stewart's goal put the U.S. soccer team ahead of 
Colombia, 2-0, and goalie Tony Meola made it stand up in a 2-1 victory, 
America's new fad is soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 And the windmill chasers of American sports finally can act smug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been engaged in conversations about soccer and about the World Cup in 
the past few days with people that had never uttered the word soccer before," 
said Harvey Lightstone, a Woodland Hills insurance claims director. 
"Particularly after (Wednesday's) astonishing win." 
</P>
<P>
 Lightstone is a longtime flag waver for American soccer, a group that 
Wednesday got a welcome case of whiplash from the sudden sharp shift in the 
nation's view of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got quite a library of soccer books, and they're all out on loan," 
Lightstone said. "No one ever asked to borrow my books before. People want to 
understand what they are witnessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Luth, a gas company meter reader in Orange County, says he has the 
perfect job because, "I have lots of extra time for my soccer stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Luth officiates and coaches in youth leagues and sits on an advisory board for 
the Anaheim Splash, an indoor soccer team. "I was just on my way to a (Splash) 
board meeting and tuned into KABC in my truck," Luth said. "These guys on the 
radio, who a week ago were pooh-poohing soccer, now they're 'Did you see this 
game?' They're starting to get the bug. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, kids have loved the sport for years, but now parents are beginning 
to understand what all the excitement is about." 
</P>
<P>
 But some soccer die-hards have been left at the altar too many times to trust 
the current fad. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Stauber, a journalism student at Seattle Pacific University who has 
written about the game for commemorative publications, claims to have watched 
every minute of every game in the tournament. That commitment to cable has kept 
him from taking in the full scope of the public interest swing, but he has 
watched with bemusement at soccer bandwagons parading across the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't gotten out a lot since (the World Cup) started," Stauber said. "But 
I have a lot of non-soccer playing friends, and a lot of them have been talking 
about the games." 
</P>
<P>
 Among hard-core skeptics, Stauber says, the real measure of success for the 
Cup is going to be if the current interest carries over to the new national 
professional soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
 If fans get on the bandwagon of the league, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get fans somehow, and I'm sure that goes on in all sports," 
Stauber said. "The World Cup is here now, but four years from now it will be 
somewhere else. (A pro league) can be a lasting accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Luth is happy to ride the current swell of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the hotbed season for (youth) tournaments," he said. "People are 
showing up at fields just to watch soccer who obviously have no ties to any of 
the teams." 
</P>
<P>
 What has surprised Lightstone is the lack of understanding at the history of 
American soccer that built toward Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people out there think this happened overnight," Lightstone said. 
"This is 30 years of moms and pops dragging their kids to soccer practice. 
There has been soccer in this country for as long as there has been baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Mearson, a vehicle maintenance director in Santa Paula, estimates he 
watches, competes in or referees 300 games a year. He is simply happy that 
America has not embarrassed itself with raging apathy on the world's biggest 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a hard time with a (pre-Cup) study that 71% of Americans didn't know 
the World Cup was coming," Mearson said. "I didn't understand how people could 
not even realize what an opportunity it is to host this event." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls and, more indicatively, TV ratings paint a brighter picture of 
public awareness. But Stauber said he thinks the inroads soccer makes after the 
Cup will be in direct proportion to the success of the U.S. team -- not 
counting the Colombia game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm guessing that a lot of people didn't see that game," Stauber said. 
"People didn't know that Colombia was one of the top four teams. They say, 'Who 
is Colombia? They're good? We beat them? Great!' Now they'll watch the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the summer that will tell if soccer survives. If anything is going to 
do it, it's going to be the U.S. going on (in the tournament). The farther they 
get, the bigger the bandwagon is going to get."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; WORLD CUP IS POSITIVELY THE BEST EVENT FOR THEM

 Nieves Caron hears the talk, and it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Bolivian wife of a professor at the University of Delaware, she spends 
most of her time around academics who should know better. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, she hears the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, so you're from Bolivia? Isn't that where they make all the cocaine?  
</P>
<P>
 Caron attended a recent World Cup match with her husband, not only to cheer 
her soccer team but to celebrate that, finally, perhaps the people of the 
United States will see something different. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of cocaine, perhaps they will see cheerleaders in native headdresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of drug lords, they will see youngsters painted in green, orange and 
red, bobbing and chanting for hours 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of seeing stereotypes, they will see people. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe next time they see her at the supermarket and think of her homeland, 
who knows, maybe they will actually say something nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bolivia being here may not be too important to the United States," Caron 
said. "But for the United States to see us like this . . . it is very important 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
 As millions of immigrants here have learned during the first week of the World 
Cup, no event in recent history has done more for battered images. 
</P>
<P>
 One expert said that no country has benefited as much from these games as 
Mexico. Anybody mesmerized by the daring of goalkeeper Jorge Campos and the 
energy of Mexico's thousands of fans would agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have Mexican-American friends who are thrilled to see that Mexico is being 
talked about for something other than illegal aliens or strikes in the field," 
said Jay Coakley, sociology professor at University of Colorado in Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For once, Mexico is seen as being one of the world's elite. And for once, 
they are being treated in the media as such. This is a tremendous benefit, not 
just for them, but all countries." 
</P>
<P>
 For once, too, some are realizing that North and South Korea are not the same 
countries. That the South Koreans are not the people with the militaristic 
government. That South Koreans are not the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Han Byung Nam, a Long Island businessman, said his native land is benefiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "For once, people are seeing Koreans when they are happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as people are finally talking to Dr. Boris Murillo about something other 
than their illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo, who left Bolivia four years ago, heard the oddest thing upon arriving 
at work on the day after Germany had defeated his country in the World Cup 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, sorry about you guys yesterday," a colleague told him. "But we'll be 
cheering for you next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine that, Murillo thought. Somebody in his new country rooting for 
Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Beats the heck out of those jokes about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; SOCCER IN THE COLONIES; BRITISH WERE GOING TO KEEP A STIFF 
UPPER LIP, BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED: HOW 'BOUT THEM IRISH! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The sometimes brilliant play in the opening round of the World Cup has left 
British fans with mixed emotions. As a soccer-loving nation, they are thrilled 
by the action. But without a team in the tournament, they aren't sure whom to 
root for. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Kingdom, which claims to have invented professional soccer, is 
allowed to field four teams in World Cup competition -- England, Scotland, 
Wales and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those teams showed flashes of inspiration during the long competition 
for a berth in the finals, none qualified. When England failed, the nation's 
sports fans were humiliated and furious -- and the coach of the team, Graham 
Taylor, was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the first U.S. World Cup, much of the British media and public 
was in a carping mood: 
</P>
<P>
 What did the Americans know about soccer? The stadiums would be half-empty. 
The World Cup would be a disaster -- and with good riddance for trusting the 
competition to the upstart Yanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team was in the competition, the grumbling ran, only because it was 
the host country. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the British sports pages turned to coverage of the U.S. Open golf 
tournament and Wimbledon tennis. Writers on the World Cup had trouble placing 
the events in the proper venues. Chicago, for instance, was described as a city 
in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last week, the mood in Britain has changed markedly. Pubs are full 
during games. Some Britons arrive for work bleary-eyed after watching a 
post-midnight game. And, surprise, the Brits have a team to cheer for. 
</P>
<P>
 That team is fielded by Ireland -- a country with which Britain has always had 
an ambivalent relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to look down on the Irish in football," commented one professional 
man who adjourns to his suburban pub during evening World Cup matches. "Now 
we're looking up at them. Go Ireland!" 
</P>
<P>
 The British media seemed overjoyed when Ireland beat the highly touted 
Italians in their first game, and all the papers have assigned a reporter to 
the Irish training camp in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there are plenty of reasons for the British support of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish manager is a famous and popular Yorkshireman, Jack Charlton, whom 
Dubliners have christened "St. Jack." He is a brother of the English soccer 
star, Bobby Charlton, who was just knighted for services to sport. 
</P>
<P>
 And almost all of Ireland's team plays for British clubs. Some of the Irish 
players have dual citizenship but chose to play under the flag of the green, 
white and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 So the British have adopted the Irish team. As John Duncan, the soccer writer 
of the Guardian newspaper, observed, "A lot of people here are struggling 
through their ancestry to find an Irish connection." 
</P>
<P>
 And the best-selling tabloid, the Sun, which knows a good story when it sees 
one, has urged its readers to fax good-luck messages to the Ireland squad 
through the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Not given to understatement, the Sun declared: "We want you to get behind Jack 
Charlton and his Republic of Ireland World Cup heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland notwithstanding, such has been the quality of play that British 
television spectators have had plenty to watch and to lift their sporting 
spirits. Every newspaper has columns of results and comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, the level of football has been so good that it has encouraged a 
high level of interest," wrote Duncan. "There are so many good matches to watch 
that we don't really need our own team." 
</P>
<P>
 England, although it has won only one World Cup, always has performed well 
when it reached the finals. It lost to Germany in 1990 only through penalty 
kicks, and in 1986 lost to Argentina when Diego Maradona scored on an obvious 
but unpenalized hand ball, which he christened "the hand of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the British fans can boo their personal villains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is just itching for the Germans to mess up and for the Argentinians 
to get stuffed," Duncan said. "At the same time, we like underdogs, so there 
are all sorts of teams like Saudi Arabia to keep us amused." 
</P>
<P>
 What has genuinely surprised the British, as well as many others, is the 
wonderful show being made of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans have done really well," said one fan. "We are impressed by the 
size of the crowds. There are very few places in the world where you'd get 
43,000 people to turn out for a match between Nigeria and Bulgaria." 
</P>
<P>
 The papers have gone so far as to compliment the American team and the U.S. 
sports fans. As one writer remarked, "Americans don't like draws. But it beats 
losing." 
</P>
<P>
 After the first week, British writers had definitely changed their tune. As a 
leading writer, Rob Hughes, reported from Washington, "Soccer will never 
colonize America, may never sink its contagious roots here, but it is beginning 
to turn the tide of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten games have passed, none without a goal and none importing hooliganism. 
Quicker than we expected, the host is feeling more comfortable staging the 
premier event of a game addictive to the rest of the world."

FIRES CHAR 4,000 ACRES IN SOUTHLAND; EMERGENCIES: NO SERIOUS INJURIES REPORTED 
BUT SOME FAMILIES LEFT HOMELESS. LARGEST BLAZE ERUPTS IN ANGELES FOREST. 
</P>

 Scorching temperatures and high winds fanned wildfires across Southern 
California on Saturday, as firefighters in four counties battled blazes that 
left more than 4,000 acres charred and a handful of homes destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported in any of the fires, the largest of which broke out 
about 11:30 a.m. in the Angeles National Forest in eastern Los Angeles County. 
In that blaze, flames quickly skipped the San Bernardino County line, consuming 
an estimated 2,000 acres near Pinon Hills, about 15 miles northeast of 
Wrightwood. 
</P>
<P>
 By early evening, about 800 firefighters from the two counties began to get 
the upper hand, said Los Angeles County Fire Dispatcher Cheryl Patterson. The 
cause of the fire was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 homes and one mobile home were destroyed in the fire, which sent 
many residents of the sparsely populated area fleeing with their livestock. The 
Red Cross set up a relief station for displaced fire victims at Pinon Mesa 
Middle School, 9298 Sheep Creek Road, in Phelan, county Fire Inspector Michael 
Chuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 500 acres were burned in the Angeles National Forest near 
Palmdale in a blaze that ignited at the Kentucky Springs Shooting Range on 
Kentucky Springs Road and Angeles Forest Highway, Patterson said. About 200 
U.S. Forest Service and county firefighters fought the blaze, which was still 
out of control at 8 p.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the expensive west San Fernando Valley enclave of Porter Ranch, a brush 
fire erupted above homes in the area and burned about 60 acres. The blaze began 
about 3:50 p.m. in the 19000 block of West Kilfinan Street, said Jim Wells, a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty fire companies and five helicopters were called out to fight the fire, 
which was fueled by the Valley's highest temperatures so far this year. The 
blaze was fully contained shortly before 7:30 p.m., Wells said. The cause is 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside County, another fire about 45 miles east of Hemet blackened 850 
acres and threatened mobile homes and million-dollar horse ranches. No damage 
was reported but evacuation orders were issued for the city of Anza. 
Firefighters had contained about one-third of the fire by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County firefighters battled a brush fire that burned about 700 acres 
near the small community of Olinda Village. Firefighters contained the fire by 
nightfall.  
</P>
<P>
 No structures were damaged, but one firefighter was treated for heat 
exhaustion. The blaze was burning in an undeveloped area near Carbon Canyon and 
Olinda roads, near where Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The brush fires were nurtured by some of the highest temperatures of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank hit 99 degrees while Woodland Hills topped out at 103, according to 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's temperatures are expected to be much the same, ranging from the 90s to 
104 degrees, meteorologist Curtis Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat wave should be over by Monday, Brack said.

PRICED WELL UNDER PAR; DEVELOPMENT POSSIBLE AS STUDIO CITY GOLF COURSE PROPERTY 
GOES UP FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greening the urban gray for nearly four decades, the land occupied by the 
popular Studio City Golf Course is up for sale.  
</P>
<P>
 People who know area real estate say the $10-million asking price is a bargain 
and, should it sell, the property could be open to development. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17.2 acres in the heart of Studio City -- sporting a nine-hole golf 
course, driving range and tennis courts -- are being offered for sale by the 
Weddington Investment Partnership. The land and an adjacent swath were offered 
in 1987 for $42 million, and in 1989 went into escrow for $18 million before 
the buyer pulled out, according to owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten million for that kind of acreage in a central area is just remarkable," 
said Tom Rath, the city planning associate who oversees the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Sale now could be easier, say owners, not just because of the price, but 
because of the recent discovery that the independently owned golf course has 
apparently been operating without a permit since 1985. The lack of a permit 
could also simplify development of the site, city planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to documents obtained by The Times, the conditional-use permit for 
the golf course expired nine years ago. Co-owner Guy Weddington McCreary said 
the apparent expiration was only recently discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of that discovery, McCreary said, is that under the original 
1955 agreement with the golf course, the course would lose its lease without a 
conditional-use permit. Owners are excited about that possibility, as they 
receive a mere $1,000 a month rent for the prime property, a figure also 
spelled out 39 years ago in the lease agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to sell the land in the 1980s were hampered by the fact that 
potential buyers were -- or assumed they were -- locked into keeping the golf 
course, whose lease reaches to the year 2005, McCreary said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the lease is nullified, a buyer could potentially -- likely, according to 
some -- develop at least some of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent private meeting, the Weddington Investment Partnership offered to 
sell the course, driving range and 20 tennis courts to the city Parks and 
Recreation Department, with the possibility of the operation being kept open 
and run by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials would not comment on the offer, but according to sources 
at the meeting, the department indicated it would like to have the property but 
could not afford such a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Rath said some development would probably follow a sale, as development could 
almost certainly produce a greater financial return than a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how you'd make $10 million in greens fees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A compromise often takes place in such situations, Rath added, one in which 
the developer agrees to leave some of the land intact -- a portion of the golf 
course, for example -- in exchange for the approval to develop another portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Any development would come under "close scrutiny" -- and possible opposition 
-- by the powerful Studio City Residents Assn., which has long supported the 
urban oasis, said association President Tony Lucente  
</P>
<P>
 Also, the land is zoned for light agricultural use and planned as open "green 
space" for park-type facilities. For most types of development, both a zone 
change and plan change would be required. 
</P>
<P>
 While the community has had a longtime love affair with the course it 
considers its own, the Weddington family, which has been locked into a lease 
that reflects a bygone era, has sought to sell the land for an equally long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the lease) was signed by my great uncle, and it's just been . . . a 
misery for a long time," McCreary said. "You get $1,000 a month for all this 
property. It destroys you as far as economic return. You're land poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1955 lease was for 25 years with another 25-year extension, 
McCreary said, family members assumed they would be able to resell or re-lease 
the land for a higher price when its operating permit expired 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But another permit was granted in 1965, and again in 1975, making it valid 
through May, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weddington partnership has had three law firms study the original 
agreements in recent years seeking a way out of the lease, McCreary said, but 
the permit expiration "loophole" was found only recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course General Manager George McCallister said only, "We've got an 
ironclad lease on that." 
</P>
<P>
 While no potential buyers have made overtures in the two weeks the property 
has been on the market, according to co-owner Barry Weddington, one party is 
greatly interested in a corner of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that's going to be the spot" for a new fire station, Fire Capt. 
Louis Poupoli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City's only fire station, No. 78, near the intersection of Coldwater 
Canyon Avenue and Ventura Boulevard, was condemned in April after the 
Northridge earthquake Jan. 17 caused slight damage and aftershocks continued to 
weaken the 47-year-old structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, fire officials and McCreary have discussed a land swap, which would give 
the Fire Department one acre of the golf course property near the corner of 
Whitsett Avenue and Ventura Boulevard. In exchange, the Weddington partnership 
would get an undeveloped road near the golf course it deeded to the city during 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Fire Department to move in, however, four tennis courts and other 
improvements belonging to the golf course would have to go, and no final deals 
have been made, both parties stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 While the negotiations continue with the Fire Department and marketing 
strategies are planned for a possible sale, everyone involved -- including the 
Weddingtons themselves -- would like to see the area retain at least some of 
its natural charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would much prefer to see something that has community return," Rath said. 
"But since the city doesn't have enough money to buy it . . . I'm not sure we'd 
have much say."

VALLEY POLITICIANS CLASH OVER HEALTH CARE; LEGISLATION: PHILOSOPHICAL STRUGGLE 
BETWEEN REPS. WAXMAN AND MOORHEAD REFLECTS PARTISAN POLARIZATION ON HOUSE 
PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of painstaking work on health care reform, the conflicting 
efforts of San Fernando Valley area Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) remain mired in a prolonged legislative 
stalemate -- even as other proposals move toward the House and Senate floors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the two veteran lawmakers reflect the partisan polarization that has 
prevented the Energy and Commerce Committee -- on which both hold key 
leadership posts -- from moving a bill. The panel, one of three in the House 
with jurisdiction over health care, may be bypassed entirely if the current 
logjam cannot be broken soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest stumbling block between the two lawmakers, as well as the rest of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee, remains a requirement that employers pay for 
health care for employees. Waxman strongly favors this approach to achieve the 
universal coverage that President Clinton insists is essential; Moorhead 
opposes any such requirement on business. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate goals of the lawmakers contrast as well. The liberal Waxman vows 
to hold out for a comprehensive overhaul and guaranteed coverage for all; the 
conservative Moorhead favors moving forward with only incremental insurance 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, they both stand in contrast to a bipartisan coalition of Senate 
moderates who are trying to hammer out a compromise.  
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, the senior Republican on Energy and Commerce, says many citizens 
would shout "hooray" if Congress adjourns without passing a health care bill. 
He said the public is divided on health care reform generally but shows little 
enthusiasm for Clinton's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman disagrees. The longtime chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and environment expressed cautious optimism that 
Clinton's goal can still be reached in this session of Congress. But he 
acknowledged that time is growing short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still probable that we'll get a health care bill through but I can't say 
so with any certainty," Waxman said. "The failure to enact health care 
legislation, I think, is going to be a prospect that members won't want to face 
as we approach the election" in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts by Energy and Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), Waxman and 
other Democrats to persuade a majority of the 44-member committee to support a 
scaled-back version of Clinton's plan have foundered. The panel's leaders have 
been trying for weeks to round up more conservative Democratic members who are 
concerned about an overly bureaucratic approach and the burdens that would be 
imposed on small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 They need most of the Democrats because the 17 Republicans are united in 
opposition to anything that resembles Clinton's proposal or, presumably, 
includes employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Moorhead, who talks to Dingell regularly, and Waxman offer 
contrasting explanations for the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans don't want Clinton to have anything that's called a health 
care bill that he can take credit for," asserted Waxman, one of the House's 
master tacticians. "The Republicans who understand health care policy and are 
ordinarily constructive are being told by their partisan leaders that they 
better not cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Moorhead. He blamed the Democrats for refusing to allow a vote on 
a gradualist Republican-sponsored bill that includes such steps as preventing 
insurance companies from denying coverage to those who have pre-existing 
conditions or those who change jobs. It would require employers to offer -- but 
not necessarily pay for -- policies for their workers and allow employers to 
join health-care purchasing cooperatives to get lower rates from insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead maintains that this bill would be passed by a coalition of 
Republicans and moderate to conservative Democrats if it was considered by the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the legislation hasn't come before Congress is that they can't get 
enough Democrats who will go for mandates," Moorhead said. "They'll blame 
anyone but themselves. But I can tell you, it will be their own fault." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the House Education and Labor Committee approved a modified 
version of Clinton's plan last week that provides health insurance for all 
Americans and requires employers to pay 80% of the premiums for their workers. 
The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee passed a similar measure three 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a reflection of the increasingly partisan tone of the health-care 
debate, the House committee acted without any Republican support. Education and 
Labor is one of the chamber's most liberal committees; the more conservative 
Energy and Commerce Committee, in contrast, is considered more representative 
of the House's overall makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 If Energy and Commerce doesn't move a bill, Waxman said, "we will work with 
the (Democratic) leadership and the other committees that have jurisdiction to 
fashion the legislation that will go to the House floor. It's all very muddled 
at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman reacted warily to recent proposals advanced by colleagues trying to 
negotiate a compromise. These include a trigger mechanism whereby Congress 
would suspend the employer mandate for five years; then, if insurance reforms 
alone and voluntary efforts failed to achieve universal coverage, a mandate 
would automatically kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of a triggering-in mechanism to cover people under certain 
circumstances is not offensive to me if we can be assured that everybody's 
going to be covered," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the way I would prefer to handle the legislation, but it's a 
compromise we may have to accept if we get the assurance that we will have 
universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Under another version of this proposal, Congress would have to reconsider the 
issue and vote on whether to impose the employer mandate if universal coverage 
wasn't achieved initially. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman was less enthusiastic about this approach. "If it has to come back, 
that's meaningless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead refused to endorse either approach. He said that anything that 
resembled Clinton's plan "would be disastrous for the American people. It would 
put them under a socialized medical care system." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he said, if the Democrats would help pass the insurance reforms in the 
Republican bills, "they would have solved 95% of the problem. You don't need 
universality. You need to have health care available to all Americans. If some 
guy decides he doesn't want health insurance but he has the money to take care 
of himself, you don't need him covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, however, said that without either an employer mandate or a tax 
increase or both, the money will not be available to pay for universal health 
care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we basically cover all Americans, we can't hold down increasing health 
care costs and the reforms won't work, he said. "So, the sooner we get to that 
point, the better."

VALLEY BRIEFING: THE ORIGINAL SUPERHIGHWAY; HOW BOTTS' DOTS AND OTHER DEVICES 
IMPROVE FLOW AND SAFETY OF AREA FREEWAYS

 You enter a San Fernando Valley freeway only after a ramp meter gives you the 
go-ahead, gradually making your way through traffic to the left lane. You drift 
too close to the median, which nudges you back into your lane. Changing radio 
stations for some traffic advice, you drift toward the adjacent lane, but 
raised lane marker dots keep you in line. An electronic message sign warns of 
stopped traffic ahead, so you decide to exit, when . . . boom, a flat tire. You 
pull off to use a call box which, with the push of a button, puts you in touch 
with highway patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers may take it for granted, but they benefit from freeway safety and 
convenience technology pioneered right here in Los Angeles. In the 54 years 
since the state's first freeway, the Pasadena, was built, freeway 
transportation has moved toward "smart" technology that puts cars in close 
communication with transportation centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the automobile arrived in Los Angeles in 1900, an expedition across the 
San Fernando Valley could take as long as a day. It still may seem that way to 
Valley travelers in heavy traffic, but traffic monitoring devices improve 
traffic speeds about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 How does the technology work, who monitors it, and what may be on the horizon? 
A freeway technology guide for the Valley driver tells it all: Jersey Barriers 
& Gawk Screens 
</P>
<P>
 * The 3.5-foot-tall concrete medians are fluted at the bottom to ease cars 
that bump into them back onto the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Green plastic baffles or mesh screens are often placed on top of medians to 
prevent motorists from gawking at incidents on the other side of the freeway. 
Closed-circuit Cameras 
</P>
<P>
 * Cameras are linked to a microwave transmitter, which sends video signals to 
Caltrans Traffic Operations Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltrans can respond by dispatching tow trucks, CHP units, ambulances, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 * There are 17 cameras on the Santa Monica Freeway, downtown interchanges and 
on the Golden State Freeway. More are being installed on the Golden State 
Freeway. Call Boxes 
</P>
<P>
 * Originally installed in 1962, all of the 4,000 boxes along highways have 
been replaced with new solar-powered cellular models. 
</P>
<P>
 * The boxes are made of vandal-resistant plastic and are attached to breakaway 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
 * The improved boxes have bilingual usage instructions and screen out freeway 
noise. Botts' Dots 
</P>
<P>
 * There are more than 3 million Botts' Dots dividing Los Angeles freeway 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Developed by Caltrans engineer Elbert D. Botts in the early 1950s, but not 
used until 1965 when a successful asphalt adhesive was developed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rows of four ceramic dots and a reflective plastic one are installed every 
48 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * They last about six years and cost $1.50 apiece for a ceramic dot, $3.50 for 
a plastic reflective one. Traffic Operations Center 
</P>
<P>
 * This is the transportation nerve center downtown where Caltrans works in 
conjunction with the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 * The center uses a large electronic map of the region's freeways, on which 
colored lights correspond to current freeway speeds. Changeable Message Signs 
</P>
<P>
 * Signs alert motorists to problem traffic conditions and recommend detours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Messages are programmed by operators at the Caltrans Traffic Operations 
Center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * Currently there are 62 signs, with plans to add another 43 by 2001. Ramp 
Meters 
</P>
<P>
 * Introduced in 1966, today there are more than 1,000 such meters statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meters are timed based on traffic flow, which is picked up by loop detectors 
in pavement. Caltrans' central computer downtown analyzes traffic flow and sets 
signals accordingly. Electromagnetic Loop Detectors 
</P>
<P>
 * Wire loops below the road's surface are linked by phone line to the 
operations center. 
</P>
<P>
 * They register the flow of traffic and can detect when traffic is at a 
standstill.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SCHOOL'S UNIFORM RULE MAY START A NEW TREND; 
EDUCATION: LA MESA JUNIOR HIGH'S NEW POLICY HAS GENERATED INTEREST AS TWO OTHER 
DISTRICTS PLAN TO DISCUSS SIMILAR IDEAS. 
</P>

<P>
 La Mesa Junior High School may have launched a clothing trend with its new 
mandatory uniform program. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart High School District became the first in the Santa Clarita 
Valley to impose a uniform code when it decided this month that La Mesa 
students would be limited to certain types of clothing incorporating the school 
colors of black, white and teal. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, two other school districts are discussing similar policies. Castaic 
Union School District trustees on Thursday discussed options for a uniform 
policy in their rural district in the northern region of the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees raised the issue after hearing about the Hart district's decision and 
will be watching the policy's success or failure at La Mesa, according to Supt. 
Scott Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will look at our neighbor who is farther down the path to lead the way," 
Brown said. "Our board is an awful long way away from even raising the 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said any decision to require uniforms would not take effect until the 
1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniform advocates say academic performance improves and peer pressure is 
reduced when clothing is regulated. The policy may also save money for parents 
as they dispense with buying trendy, expensive clothes for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say uniforms stifle individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, board members of the Newhall School District reviewed a survey of 
about 1,000 parents that showed three out of four favor a uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall officials had been assembling a comprehensive dress code for the 
district during the past eight months, with scant mention of mandatory uniforms 
until La Mesa's program was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden there was a focus on what had been a side issue," Supt. J. 
Michael McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall officials are now reviewing the survey for specific comments about 
uniforms and will probably continue discussions through the beginning of the 
upcoming school year, McGrath said. Additional surveys with more specific 
questions will probably be sent to parents this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If uniforms are going to be the thing of the day, elementary school is the 
place to start," McGrath said.

 A Senate committee has approved a bill to allow gay and other unmarried 
couples to officially register their relationships with the state and share 
rights now enjoyed by married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 A 7-3 vote sent the legislation (AB 2810) by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) from the Judiciary Committee to the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would set up a legal framework for domestic partnerships, require 
hospitals to include such domestic partners in family-only patient visits, and 
revise state laws relating to wills and conservatorships. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a half-million unmarried couples in California who live together 
and provide warm and loving homes," Katz said. "My bill gives these couples a 
few basic rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the legislation charge that it condones homosexuality and demeans 
traditional family values. ASSEMBLY

SIMI BUS RIDERS MAY FACE FARE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley bus riders soon may be paying higher fares to ride fewer buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Simi Valley Transit is carrying more riders than ever in its 
22-year history, fare revenue has dropped as much as 5% on some routes, while 
costs have jumped nearly 6%. The increased cost of providing service has 
prompted city staff members to recommend fare hikes and service cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to stop and ask ourselves how much we want to subsidize the buses," 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels said. "Raising fares may be the only alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to run Simi Valley's buses at their current level of service for 
another fiscal year is estimated at $1.6 million, $83,000 more than the cost 
for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents took nearly 400,000 trips on the city's four bus lines in fiscal 
1993-94, an increase of 22,000 riders over the previous year. Regular fares are 
75 cents, while the rate for senior citizens is 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 But fare discounts and rising maintenance costs have increased the cost of 
providing service on Simi Valley Transit, the second-largest bus service in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 To earn its general fund subsidy, the bus system's fares must account for 20% 
of the cost of the service, according to a formula developed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special budget meeting last week, Diane Jones, environmental services 
director, told the City Council that fares this fiscal year have covered only 
18.5% of the cost of bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city maintains the current level of service without increasing fares 
next fiscal year, the fare box revenue will cover less than 17% of the cost of 
service, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to hold a public hearing on the matter in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going the have to take a really close look at some of the 
routes and figure out if there's anything we can do without," Mayor Greg 
Stratton said. "And we may have to bite the bullet and go to a higher rate." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the council rejected a plan to hike fares for the first time in 
five years, after residents protested that they could not afford to pay more to 
ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council lowered fares on midday buses, hoping to lure enough new 
riders to offset the decrease in fares. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., regular 
fares are 50 cents and the fare for seniors is 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Midday ridership increased after the council's action, but not enough to make 
up for the lost fares and higher maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance fees are spent mostly on repairing the city's aging fleet of 
buses, some of which are 10 years old, Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city is delaying the purchase of new buses until staff members complete a 
study of alternative fuel models to comply with federal air regulations and 
help cut down on smog in the city, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the cost of bus service, staff members are recommending that the 
city drop the reduced fares and cut early morning and Saturday service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Matthew Ayers considered the effects of a rate increase or a 
service cut as he waited at the bus stop Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents buy me a bus pass, so I'm not too worried about a fare increase," 
Matthew said. "But I take the bus to school every day, so I wouldn't want to 
see any service cut."
