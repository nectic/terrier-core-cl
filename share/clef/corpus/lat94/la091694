 In the Thick of It: There's a network TV traffic jam these days at the airport 
in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as the Big Three and CNN send correspondents and 
crews to cover the anticipated U.S. invasion. CBS' Dan Rather is already there, 
along with Bob Simon and Vicki Maybrey. NBC has Jim Maceda on the way to join 
Rick Davis. Tom Brokaw will stay in New York -- for the time being. ABC has, 
either there or going soon, Linda Patillo, Chris Bury, Jim Wooten, Jim Laurie 
and Ron Claiborne, with Peter Jennings holding down the fort in New York. CNN 
has sent Rob Reynolds and Jim Clancy, with Christiane Amanpour and Richard 
Blystone on their way. But what about the possibility of a U.S. 
government-imposed news blackout, a la Grenada and the Gulf War? No chance, 
sources say. "This is the most publicly advanced invasion in history," says CNN 
Executive Vice President Ed Turner. "This one would be pretty hard to miss."

 Privacy Rights Upheld: In a case that is likely to affect both TV news and 
reality shows, a federal appeals court in New York has ruled that a Secret 
Service agent, James Mottola, violated the constitutional right to privacy when 
he took a crew from CBS' "Street Stories" newsmagazine along with him on a 1992 
raid and search of the New York apartment of a man suspected of credit fraud. 
The subject of the search, Babatunde Ayeni, sued CBS, along with Mottola and 
other, unnamed agents, saying that the videotaped search violated his privacy. 
CBS claimed it had journalistic privilege to be there under the First 
Amendment, but a federal judge disagreed. CBS subsequently settled out of court 
with Ayeni and his family. But Mottola appealed, claiming immunity as a federal 
official. This week, however, the appeals court rejected that claim and said 
that he can be sued for damages. "A private home is not a soundstage for 
law-enforcement theatrics," the court said in a strongly worded opinion. DANCE

 Nureyev's Island Legacy: Three islands off southern Italy's Amalfi coast that

$3 million, auction house Christie's said on Thursday. The islands, known as 
the Li Galli archipelago, are being sold to benefit the Russian-born dancer's 
Ballet Promotion Foundations. The largest island has a lighthouse, a heliport 
and a tower that Nureyev fitted with a private dance studio. Nureyev died last 
year of an AIDS-related illness.

ROGER CLINTON GETS THAT '70S SOUND WITH 'NOTHING GOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This may not be a good month for Clinton approval ratings -- any Clinton's. At 
least Bill and Roger might be singing the same tune: "Born Under a Bad Sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The Albert King blues standard finishes off Roger Clinton's long-awaited (sort 
of) debut album, "Nothing Good Comes Easy," a project in the works since the 
presidential half-brother was signed to a record deal in late '92. 
</P>
<P>
 What Fleetwood Mac's anthem "Don't Stop" was to that comparatively halcyon 
period in history for the Clintons, "Bad Sign" may be to the fall of '94, 
especially if a Haiti invasion remains unpopular and most especially after 
Roger's reviews come in. The collection will be released Tuesday by Pyramid 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Clinton, of course, has actually been involved in music since the 
mid-'70s, playing in Arkansas blues-rock bands most of that time up to the 
fateful moment the world discovered his, uh, faculty for R&B at MTV's 
inauguration ball. 
</P>
<P>
 On his first album, the tracks are absolutely state of the art . . . for the 
late '70s. Here, you think, is someone who hasn't turned on a radio since the 
soft-rock heyday of Michael McDonald, Firefall and Ambrosia (though producer 
Scott Maclellan must be at least equally responsible for the Rip Van Winkle 
effect). 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Cross, most of all, appears to have been a serious role model. 
</P>
<P>
 The title track, embarrassingly, even goes in for a bit of ersatz Steely Dan 
chord-changing, albeit with distinctly un-Dannish lyrics penned by the 
part-time motivational speaker himself: It's my life to live / Gonna deal with 
what it is / Nobody's gonna bring me down / Got my feet on solid ground.  
</P>
<P>
 Far be it from u s to want to be the ones to bring Roger down from the ground. 
Subterranean banality aside, how's the singin'? The obvious gag would be that 
Clinton's voice is flatter than a 17-year-old case of Billy Beer, but, in fact, 
carrying a tune is just about the least of his problems here. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio has afforded him a relatively smooth, inoffensive, affectless 
croon, bordering at times on falsetto, the sort that used to be heard on any 
number of white pop-disco records in the days when signing policies were a 
little more lax. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is finding a collection of songs that are none too vocally taxing. A 
few tracks toward the end of the album go for the more soulful approach, making 
more overt use of the Muscle Shoals players backing him up, but at least 
Clinton and his producer were smart enough not to go in for nearly as many R&B 
affectations as in his bar-band days here. 
</P>
<P>
 Except . . . Did we say stuck in the '70s? Aw contraire , there is that rap 
interlude that pops up like a horror-movie jack-in-the-box in the middle of 
"Different Man." To paraphrase Fleetwood Mac: Don't . . . stop . . . thinking 
about a day job. On the plus side, Roger Clinton has never had anything to do 
with a failed S&L.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'PRINCESS CARABOO' FULL OF WIT AND CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Witty and hilarious, "Princess Caraboo" is at once a romantic adventure and a 
comedy of manners in the finest tradition of British screen humor, a 
sophisticated entertainment that should be a delight for older children as well 
with its Cinderella-like story. 
</P>
<P>
 An outstanding international cast, impeccable period design, a lovely score 
and an inspired screenplay have been blended to perfection by astute director 
Michael Austin to create a lively and constant pleasure. Amazingly, the film is 
based on a true story. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of the mysterious Princess Caraboo in England on or near Good 
Friday in 1817 marked the convergence of two dominant social forces. Laws 
concerning begging, fraud and vagrancy had just been made extremely harsh while 
the Prince Regent, with his fanciful Brighton Pavilion in the midst of an 
elaborate remodeling, had made fashionable fantastic interpretations of Asian 
decor and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, when a proud, beautiful but dirty-faced young woman (Phoebe 
Cates) shows up in Bristol, wearing a turban and pants and uttering sparse 
phrases from a vaguely Southeast Asian dialect she is at once in mortal danger 
and in a position of great opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 If she can be proven to be a fraud she faces death by hanging; if she catches 
the fancy of the nouveau riche, the aristocracy and especially the fatuous heir 
(John Sessions) to the throne himself, a fabulous life of luxury and privilege 
awaits her. The great thing is that the deliciously ambiguous Cates and the 
film itself keep us guessing right up to the climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin and his co-writer John Wells have succeeded on two important counts: 
first, in scattering the fewest possible tidbits of conjecture about the woman 
who calls herself Caraboo, and second, in showing just how rapidly people will 
weave them into a plausible, albeit far-fetched, narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Very swiftly it is widely understood throughout the community that Caraboo 
really is a Southeast Asian princess who was kidnaped by pirates but who 
managed to jump ship in the Bristol Channel. Quite apart from the question of 
the authenticity of Caraboo's identity, the film suggests just how badly people 
can want to believe in someone for myriad reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Caraboo, in any event, finds shelter at a handsome Adamesque country estate 
rented by the Worralls (Wendy Hughes, Jim Broadbent). Mrs. Worrall, who has 
inherited money, is kind and elegant while her husband is a comically lusty, 
womanizing vulgarian, a greedy entrepreneurial banker of dubious financial 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Only human, Mrs. Worrall can't help but take some pleasure in the social 
cachet that having a real princess under her immense roof has brought her. By 
contrast, Worrall intends to exploit Caraboo's presence to better his financial 
position in any way he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Along for the fun are such sterling players as Kevin Kline, as the Worralls' 
splendidly haughty Greek butler; John Lithgow, as a pedantic Oxford linguist 
intent on exposing Caraboo as a fraud; and, most important, Stephen Rea as a 
shrewd but caring Bristol journalist suspicious yet protective of her. (You may 
spot at a garden party lush Jerry Hall and spindly Murray Melvin, amusingly 
teamed as Lord and Lady Motley.) 
</P>
<P>
 While it is a joy to see these and other actors create a polished, witty 
ensemble, "Princess Caraboo" has as its most unusual accomplishment the ability 
to make us conscious of the important political and financial role fashion can 
play in society and individual destiny, a phenomenon rarely implied outside 
films on Louis XIV, who deliberately gathered the rich and powerful at 
Versailles and then depleted their coffers via the absurdly fancy attire they 
were expected to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 To this end production designer Michael Howells and costume designer Tom Rand 
have made crucial, major contributions as the film charts the gradual, 
ever-incresing overlay of exoticism in decor and clothing inspired by the 
exquisite princess. 
</P>

has a few suggestive moments, treated discreetly. 'Princess Caraboo'

MOVIE REVIEW; POWERFUL, EMOTIONAL 'BLUE SKY' LOSES ITS WAY AT FINISH; AN 
INFATUATION WITH MELODRAMA PUSHES TONY RICHARDSON'S LAST FILM AWAY FROM ITS 
MANY STRENGTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Blue Sky" is a confounding film, simultaneously silk purse and sow's ear. 
What begins as a compelling and beautifully acted portrait of a complex adult 
relationship ends with a B-picture finale about military secrecy, a turn of 
events as baffling as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The last picture of Tony Richardson's career, completed almost simultaneously 
with his death in 1991 but not released until now, "Blue Sky" is a throwback to 
the emotional intensity of the director's early British work (strong films like 
"Look Back in Anger" and "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner") with the 
added advantage of a lifetime's accumulated filmmaking skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson also had the benefit of Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones as Carly 
and Maj. Hank Marshall, a military couple enmeshed in a still-passionate but 
agonizing 18-year marriage. Though Lange and Jones are Oscar winners who have 
not lacked for strong parts, the combination of their ease with each other and 
their obvious trust in Richardson has resulted in intense, volatile 
performances that have to be considered among the strongest in both their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rama Laurie Stagner, whose story "Blue Sky" is taken from (and who wrote the 
script with Arlene Sarner & Jerry Leichtling), based the work on her parents' 
relationship, and much of that verisimilitude clings to this project. Its 
depiction of a family fighting for life, of two people whose ragged frailties 
make them all the more sympathetic, is enough to make most of "Blue Sky" play 
like a textbook on how to convey emotional truth on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Carly who's seen first, and as the film's passion flower opening image 
blends into a credit sequence of a red-nail-polished hand turning the pages of 
glamorous movie magazines the type of woman she is seems clear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern-bred Carly, as is shown in the scene of her exuberantly 
sunbathing topless on a beach in Hawaii while her husband and some of the men 
in his command helicopter pass, is too tempestuous to be just a type. A 
full-bore exhibitionist and tale-spinner who finds reality much too confining, 
she has a hunger for experience the more controlling major admires even though 
there are hints it has led her astray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Sky" is set in 1962, and Maj. Marshall, a military scientist involved in 
detecting radiation from U.S. nuclear testing, has a habit of speaking his mind 
to his superiors in a way that is not always appreciated. One result is a 
transfer for the Marshalls and their daughters from the paradise of Hawaii to 
the dismal backwater of Ft. Matthews, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 As the drabness of their new surroundings sinks in, the other side of Carly 
emerges. A true manic-depressive, Carly has a fragility as acute as her 
bravado, and her capacity for self-destruction is awesome. Lange's highly 
emotional yet controlled performance as a woman in agony determined, in her 
husband's words, to "take everything right over the edge" perfectly captures 
the pitch of this difficult character. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the partner who holds the family together, Jones is more sensitive and 
emotionally vulnerable than he's allowed himself to be before. Love, he tells 
their daughters, is "an exchange of energy over time," and just as water 
remains water even when it turns to vapor or even ice, he and their mother are 
determined to care for each other no matter what form their passions take. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Carly becomes a magnet for the major's formidable commanding officer, 
Col. Vince Johnson (Powers Boothe), as well as a good friend to the colonel's 
wife (Carrie Snodgress), the pain in Hank's eyes deepens, and Jones' 
performance carefully conveys how much being in love with an unchartable 
whirlwind like Carly has cost him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Sky" handles this emotional material so well it is a shock when, with no 
warning to speak of, the film at the last minute abandons what it does best and 
concentrates its energies on an indifferent scenario involving official 
suppression of test data, a subplot that was probably intended to be socially 
relevant but isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Though at first having Maj. Marshall involved with nuclear radiation makes an 
interesting counterpoint to the volatility of his marital relationship, "Blue 
Sky's" infatuation with melodrama pushes the least original and successful 
parts of the movie to the forefront and squanders hard-won believability. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the acting here is so exceptional, extending down to Amy Locane and 
Anna Klemp as the two Marshall daughters and Chris O'Donnell as the former's 
new boyfriend (and the colonel's son), that it hurts to have to mention the 
down side. While "Blue Sky's" vibrancy points up how rare that quality has 
become, the way everything finally falls to earth underlines the difficulty 
even promising projects have in staying on track all the way to the end. 
</P>
<P>

volatile marriage. 'Blue Sky'

MOVIE REVIEW; 'NOSTRADAMUS' GLUM BUT ILLUMINATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Nostradamus" is a rather conventional film bio of a highly unconventional 
man, Michel de Nostradame, the French 16th-Century physician and astrologer 
whose prophecies, which he first published in 1555, continue to fascinate 
multitudes. Filmed largely in Romania, "Nostradamus" is a handsome, 
intermittently involving large-scale period epic that presents Nostradame's 
turbulent life and times with conviction and clarity, and it is sparked by 
several stunning performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that of Turkish-born French star Tcheky Karyo in the title role 
is not one of them. The rugged Karyo, most familiar as the agent who trained 
Anne Parillaud to be an assassin in "La Femme Nikita," radiates sensitivity and 
concentration, but his Nostradame is so introspective and brooding as to seem 
glum, almost never catching fire, an approach suitable for a Rossellini or 
Bresson film but not such a straightforward picture as here. When such strong 
personalities as F. Murray Abraham, Assumpta Serna and Amanda Plummer aren't on 
screen, the film tends to become lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 While obviously the film is most likely to please avid believers of 
Nostradamus, it does suggest to wider audiences how very perilous life could be 
in the 16th Century for intellectuals, a time when learning was severely 
proscribed by the Inquisition. Indeed, director Roger Christian and his 
co-writers have effectively suggested the ways in which Nostradame's era 
parallels our own. The eternal conflict between science and religion that is at 
the heart of "Nostradamus," for example, erupted anew in the recent world 
population conference in Cairo -- just as the bubonic plague (which Nostradame 
fought with controversial natural medicines) inevitably brings to mind the AIDS 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers depict the visions that Nostradame apparently experienced 
throughout his 63 years with considerable panache, most successfully when 
Nostradame walks down a darkened street only to be confronted with rumbling 
Nazi tanks. In other instances they become too literal: The poor guy can't look 
into a bucket of water without seeing an atom bomb mushroom or J.F.K. at Dealey 
Plaza or a glimpse of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the film is charged by Abraham as Nostradame's aristocratic 
patron and fellow free-thinker and to a lesser extent by Julia Ormond as 
Abraham's feminist daughter who became Nostradame's first wife and scientific 
colleague. Rutger Hauer cameos as a mystic, a whimsical monk who consoles 
Nostradame in a period of despair. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half is livelier, thanks to radiant Assumpta Serna as Nostradame's 
supportive but outspoken Barcelona-born second wife and by Amanda Plummer as a 
wonderfully astringent Catherine de Medici, Queen of France, whose patronage 
proves a lifesaver for Nostradame. Solidly crafted, "Nostradamus" is more 
consistently intelligent and illuminating than exciting or imaginative. 
</P>
<P>

guidelines: It includes some fairly sensual scenes of lovemaking and several 
scenes of overall brutality .

MOVIE REVIEW; 'NEW AGE' COUPLE COPING IN CULTURE BOUGHT AND SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's nearly impossible to put together a picture about ennui without 
dramatically succumbing to it in a big way. Michael Tolkin, talent that he is, 
isn't yet the movie maker to meet the feat.  
</P>
<P>
 "The New Age," his second feature as a director, is an audacious attempt at 
taking a snapshot of a whole culture's moral torpor -- that is, L.A.'s -- in 
the midst of an overweening spiritual narcissism. In this it's even fleetingly 
successful, yet drags on so long past its point you feel as if you've missed 
two or three harmonic convergences. 
</P>
<P>
 The title's a joke, of sorts, of course. Tolkin's movie is pointedly 
ambivalent on matters spiritual, opening and closing with the voices of 
friendly gurus, with various drumming circles and life-passage ceremonies 
nonjudgmentally visited in-between. In these scenes he's not really spoofing or 
endorsing.  
</P>
<P>
 But the unhappily marrieds at the movie's center -- conspicuous consumers 
Peter Weller and Judy Davis -- don't allow all this fashionable etherealism to 
infringe much past the periphery of their lives, where it's a comfortable, 
curious accouterment to their materialism. The implicit gag is that when they 
flirt with New Age practices, they're still just shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ether is about the only place their credit might still be good. In a 
secular sense, the "new age" represents downward mobility for the designer set, 
a riff on the pragmatic post-Reagan years.  
</P>
<P>
 In the opening scenes, Davis sees her ad agency's primary account (a failing 
bank, of course) fall through on the same day Weller quits his agent job, 
precipitating a fast decline that threatens their Hollywood hillside way of 
life. Vaguely terrified, they react to their dwindling resources by throwing a 
lavish party, separating, embarking on separate but equal affairs (although he 
has a good head-start on her) in the same home, and selling the Ruschas. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture reaches a good comic-nightmarish peak in the middle section, when 
Davis and Weller, dumb with desperation, resolve to use said Ruschas to fund an 
expensive clothing store they open together on Melrose. Not unlike the 
restaurant scenes in Mike Leigh's "Life Is Sweet," Tolkin smartly captures the 
dread in opening -- and closing -- a small business: the initial anxiety, the 
premature glee of the first sales, the torment of sidewalk browsers who won't 
come in, the ultimate terrible sinking feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the boutique finally goes under, our couple's financial and 
psychic torment has just begun. Eventually, as they wallow in their decline and 
even negotiate mutual suicide, the film comes to seem uncomfortably like a 
drugless, upper-class "Sid and Nancy." But "Sid and Nancy's" downward spiral at 
least had an ending. Tolkin meanders toward and through at least three or four 
possible finishes, none very satisfactory -- least of all the real one, which 
sells one principal short and provides the other partner what seems like an 
artificially arrived-at triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem might be that Tolkin is so fair-minded he wants to have it 
every possible way, sacrificing a point of view in the process. In his better, 
first feature, "The Rapture," this ambivalence worked brilliantly (if 
maddeningly, for most audiences): Fundamentalist Christianity was true after 
all, but mortals were courageous in rejecting its stern God, the movie seemed 
to posit, quite an audacious bit of juggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The New Age" does offer the chance to see one of our best actresses, Davis, 
do another funny, pathetic, lip-biting malcontent, although Weller gets 
woodenly stuck with no arc to follow, having to act the caddish foil to his 
wife's minor enlightenments. The smaller roles include some varyingly 
successful but fun stunt castings, including Adam West as the crude, rich 
playboy dad who taught Weller his bad pickup lines ("How are your morals 
tonight?"), performance artist Rachel Rosenthal (!) as one of Davis' chosen 
avatars, and Samuel L. Jackson as the phone-sales huckster Weller picks as his 
guru. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the under-edited pacing flags, and Tolkin moves in more 
claustrophobically on his couple, you may feel as if you're trapped at a 
marathon two-person Debtors Anonymous meeting -- which is to say, unforgiving. 
Robert Altman, who adapted Tolkin's "The Player," might have had a field day 
elaborating on the L.A. ensemble aspects of this script. But Tolkin is too 
tightly focused on two characters -- and consequently, an audience -- in search 
of an exit. After all is moped and done, "The New Age" gets old before its 
time.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TIMECOP' TRIPS THROUGH WORLD OF TIME TRAVEL, CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heads are often spinning in Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies, usually because 
the erstwhile Muscles From Brussels has sent them into orbit with one of his 
well-placed martial arts kicks. In "Timecop," however, the spinning has a 
different cause: the dizzying premise behind the inevitable action. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted, like so many recent movies seem to be, from a comic-book series, 
"Timecop" is based on a venerable science-fiction riff: going back in time, 
even if it were possible, would be terrifically risky, because anything you did 
in the past would have incalculable effects on the present. And if you happened 
to run into yourself back then, so much the worse. 
</P>
<P>
 With side trips to the Civil War South and Wall Street during the great stock 
market crash, "Timecop" is serious about this travel business to the point of 
dividing moments spent in its Washington, D.C., setting between a pair of 
different decades. 
</P>
<P>
 One part of the film is set in 1994, the year in which a time travel device 
has just been invented. An up-and-coming young senator named Aaron McComb (Ron 
Silver) is placed in charge of congressional oversight for the machine, and a 
D.C. cop named Max Walker (Van Damme) with a loving wife (Mia Sara) is 
transferred to the Time Enforcement Commission to help police the new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2004, things are different. McComb has become an unruly presidential 
candidate desperate for money to finance a losing campaign, and Walker, his 
life marred by tragedy, is kept awfully busy going back to the past to corral 
larcenous types who think it would be nice to buy up Beverly Hills before the 
celebrities got there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mark Verheiden script has both Walker and McComb making more trips between 
1994 and 2004 than an airport shuttle. And given that everything has changed in 
2004 every time one or the other comes back from 1994, things get awfully 
confusing awfully fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his directing style (witness previous science-fiction films like 
"Outland" and "2010") is all crude energy, Peter Hyams does keep things moving 
fast enough to make figuring out how internally coherent all these plot 
complications are just about impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Never the most expressive of actors, "Timecop" marks Van Damme's attempt to 
expand his range, to turn himself into something of a romantic hero. His 
battered Hamlet look is suitably brooding, and as a concession to this new 
image, he probably beats the tar out of fewer people than he has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though this is supposed to be a kindlier Van Damme vehicle, his 
movies couldn't exist without his trademark ability to deliver the kind of 
accurate, powerful kicks any World Cup team would envy. All his soulful glances 
notwithstanding, "Timecop" still depends too much on violence to make it 
appealing to the uninitiated or the unwary. 
</P>
<P>

characters kicked and beaten into submission and a snippet of 
exploitation-style nudity. 'Timecop'

JAZZ NOTES: 'JAZZ WEST COAST' TO HONOR LIGHTHOUSE'S LEGENDARY PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ornette Coleman, Billy Higgins, Dexter Gordon, Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse 
All-Stars, Shelly Manne and His Men: These artists and bands are all considered 
giants of jazz. And they all made their mark in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz has long had a healthy tradition here, and one of the strongest centers 
for the music was the Lighthouse Cafe in Hermosa Beach, where, from 1949 until 
the late '60s, bassist Rumsey's band held forth six nights a week -- including 
the legendary 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday performance/jam session. 
</P>
<P>
 Located just steps from the sand, the Lighthouse was a rectangular room with 
hard wooden bench seats that served as home to such notables as trumpeters 
Shorty Rogers and Conte Candoli, saxophonists Bud Shank and Bob Cooper, 
trombonist Frank Rosolino, pianists Pete Jolly, Claude Williamson and Sonny 
Clark, and drummers Manne, Max Roach and Stan Levey. There music was king -- 
you might be ejected if you talked during the performances -- and it stayed 
that way until the mid-'80s. Today, it's a bar like so many others in Southern 
California, serving up anything from rock to R&B on a nightly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lighthouse's historic past will be one of the centerpieces of "Jazz 
West Coast," which celebrates jazz in Los Angeles from 1944 to the early 1960s. 
The four-day symposium of concerts, discussions and films will be held Oct. 
27-30 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in Redondo Beach, at the nearby Redondo 
Beach Performing Arts Center and at the Lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Poston, who is producing the fund-raising event for KLON-FM radio, 
anticipates that about 4,000 fans -- from all over the United States, Europe 
and Japan -- will attend. He says it was essential that he hold the affair in 
the South Bay because of its close proximity to the legendary cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just using the theme of 'Jazz West Coast' makes it one of the most important 
locations, and I knew a lot of people from around the country, and the world, 
would relate to that and feel it too," he says. "For people from Europe to go 
to where the Lighthouse is located is a big deal." (A special dinner/concert 
with Buddy Collette's quintet to be held at the Lighthouse Oct. 28 is close to 
sold out at press time.) 
</P>
<P>
 The primary thrust of "Jazz West Coast" is to demonstrate the lengthy heritage 
that jazz has had in this area. "Some important things happened here, and not 
just the cool style which was synonymous with West Coast jazz," Poston says. 
"There were hard bop bands, Ornette Coleman got his start here, there was a lot 
of straight-ahead jazz. A lot of musicians deserve credit, and 'Jazz West 
Coast' is a small way to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Many jazz greats who made major marks in Los Angeles jazz history will be on 
hand at the bash, among them Gerry Mulligan, Dave Brubeck, Harold Land, Rogers, 
Jack Sheldon, Collette, Gerald Wilson, Herb Geller, Charlie Haden, Shank, 
Candoli and Bill Holman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen concerts are scheduled, including "Innovations in Modern Music," 
which will focus on material written for Stan Kenton's 1950-51 band that in 
many ways gave birth to the experimentation in West Coast Jazz. The band, which 
includes a string section, will play the rarely heard, with-strings version of 
Bob Graettinger's "City of Glass." "Central Avenue Revisited," with Collette, 
Gerald Wiggins, Ernie Andrews and many more, will spotlight the myriad of 
activities that took place on that Los Angeles street, which was also a jazz 
hotbed in the '40s and early '50s. "The Lighthouse All-Stars Revisited" will be 
a look at Rumsey's band and the legendary musicians who played with it through 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerts -- others featuring orchestras led by Holman and Pete Rugolo, and 
small bands led by Land, Bill Perkins and Haden -- will be held at the Crowne 
Plaza, where the Grand Ballroom and the poolside Harbor Terrace seat 800 and 
600, respectively -- and at the new Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, which 
holds 1,400.  
</P>
<P>
 The four-day event is priced at $250, with individual tickets at $8-$50 also 
available. Information: (310) 985-5566, 985-7000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mum's Not Mom's: Club Cohiva (above Mum's at 144 Pine Ave. in Long Beach) is 
hosting jazz on Wednesdays. Teddy Edwards, Sal Marquez and Ernie Andrews have 
appeared, and pianist Billy Mitchell and reedman John Bolivar are set for 
Wednesday, with Paul Smith arriving Sept. 28. All bands play with Jim DiJulio's 
trio. $5 cover, no minimum. Information: (310) 437-7700. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Eyes: The name of Sonny Rollins' most recent album was incorrect in last 
week's column. "Old Flames," which features Tommy Flanagan with Rollins, is out 
on Milestone Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choice: Guillerme Vergiero's wild, propulsive Brazilian-jazz big band 
will emit even more sparks when Wayne Shorter guests with the ensemble Monday 
at the Jazz Bakery. Information: (310) 271-9039.

JAZZ REVIEW; SANDOVAL'S BOWL PROGRAM TRUMPETS HIS VIRTUOSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sonny Rollins and Grover Washington Jr. were the headliners for the season's 
final Jazz at the Bowl concert Wednesday night. But it was Arturo Sandoval who 
stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban-born trumpeter opened with a program that was simultaneously a 
delightful entertainment, an improvisational tour de force and a dazzling 
display of instrumental virtuosity. Sandoval's high-note trumpet pyrotechnics 
were predictably impressive, but he was even better in his quiet moments, 
especially during a harmonically lush reading of Benny Golson's "I Remember 
Clifford." More unexpected were his first-rate piano playing on "Stella by 
Starlight," his intermittent flashes of energetic percussion work, his 
exuberant vocalizing and his joyful interactions with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins' set, however, was not one of his best. His sound, once one of the 
most entrancing voices in jazz, was pinched and thin. And, although he took 
ample time for soloing, his choruses -- with one or two brief exceptions -- 
lacked the decisive articulation and declamatory command that characterized his 
best work. Rollins may still be capable of carrying a banner of leadership for 
the jazz tenor saxophone, but, on this evening at least, his playing was well 
behind its familiar vanguard position. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from an appearance by singer Freddy Cole, Washington's set offered few 
surprises. Still one of the finest of the growing number of saxophonists who 
trade in the world of funk, jazz and soul, he brings a rich, dark timbre and an 
authoritative melodic flow to otherwise lightweight, riff-driven music. His 
quietly lyrical, gently supportive fills for Cole's "I'm Glad There Is You" 
were the work of a musician who has the capacity -- too rarely explored -- to 
do some provocative, pure jazz playing.

CLUB REVIEW; MOLLY MALONE'S GOES BACK TO ITS ROOTS WITH VENGEANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the better part of 23 years, Molly Malone's Irish Pub marched to the beat 
of its own Celtic drummer. The tiny room in the heart of the Fairfax District 
offered a comfortable showcase for many talented singer-songwriters -- of both 
Irish and American persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly's was consistently one of the more attitude-free clubs in L.A., and even 
celebrated its clientele with wall-to-wall illustrations of the regular 
customers. Recently, however, Molly's began to lose sight of its original 
intent, booking about four groups a night, apparently without much discretion. 
With its small stage featuring everything from grunge to hard-rock, the 
Shamrock-studded venue began to lose its distinctive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 But former Molly's bartender Jeremy Hocter became the nightspot's new manager 
three months ago, and with the shift the club is going back to its original 
Irish roots with a vengeance. Currently, about half the week is filled with 
traditional Irish bands, the most popular being the Descendants, a delightful 
quartet featuring two fiddles, an acoustic guitar and a bodhran -- a hand-held 
drum you probably won't find in the clutches of a Sunset Strip band. Which is 
how it should be. With a wall portrait of one of the home country's most 
soulful sons, Van Morrison, serving as a reminder, Molly's has a legacy worth 
living up to.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; PASTA'S NOT THE THING AT FRITTO MISTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a Friday night about 9:15, Fritto Misto in Santa Monica is overflowing: The 
wait, says the friendly host, is 30 minutes. After leaning against trees, 
wondering if any of Fritto Misto's staff belong to the Culinary Workers and 
Bartenders Union across the street, after giving the evil eye to a table of 
loungers who have long since finished their desserts and paid their bill, a 
party of five decides to walk around the block. They stroll through a 
neighborhood of quiet apartment houses to a corner Winchell's where the men, 
who are starving -- it's already way past their dinner time -- can't resist 
some amuse-gueules . The party returns in time to hear Fritto Misto's host call 
their name. 
</P>
<P>
 The five are ushered into one of two white, well-lit, modestly appointed 
dining rooms. Windows are dressed in lace, wooden chairs have woven straw 
seats. Ceramic platters on the wall and cobalt drinking glasses add spots of 
concentrated color. A freezer by the door is packed with the house specialty: 
bags of former tenant Florentino's frozen fresh pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood crowd is relaxed, good-humored: Dinner won't strain anyone's 
budget, and no one rushes you. The table of loungers, for example, stays for 
hours. The host works the room, talking to anybody and everybody. The party of 
five repulse several of his advances without being, they hope, too unfriendly. 
But they're amused and content enough with their own company. 
</P>
<P>
 The five order a round of appetizers and salads. The namesake dish, fritto 
misto , is a plate of shrimp, calamari, vegetables (well, rather more 
vegetables than seafood) all dipped in a good, spicy breading, fried to an 
endearing toasty-brown, and served with a red tomato cocktail sauce and roasted 
garlic mayonnaise.  
</P>
<P>
 Salads come in two sizes; five people barely did justice to two excellent 
large salads, one a mixed baby greens with Gorgonzola and walnuts, the other a 
crisp Caesar. So far, the five agree, everybody's happy -- impressed, even. 
</P>
<P>
 Then come the pastas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh pasta (as opposed to dried) is not in and of itself an excellent thing. 
It can be quite temperamental and difficult to handle. If over-kneaded, fresh 
pasta can be tough. Otherwise, it can be fragile and easy to overcook, at which 
point it gums together and/or breaks into bits. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions are enormous here, but this does not mitigate the fact that Fritto 
Misto's cut pastas -- spaghettini, linguine, fettucine -- have all the symptoms 
of overcooking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basil spaghettini, actually a long, squared noodle, is a snarl of soft 2- and 
3-inch noodle segments stirred up with chopped tomatoes and lots of flavorless, 
scentless slivered basil. A red sauce with Italian sausage and roasted peppers 
is dense, rich, spicy-hot and inundates a pile of sodden, clumpy linguine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravioli, on the other hand, have a thick, floury, chewy dough. So-called jumbo 
ravioli, bright green squares filled with an utterly unrecognizable ground 
substance, are actually smaller than other ravioli; their sauce, with cream and 
caramelized onions, is tasty but there's way too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mild buffalo mozzarella, a delicate cheese, is hard to locate in its namesake 
ravioli, given the thick, undercooked dough and heavy, cooked-down marinara. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta, as some of the five found out later, is not necessarily handled better 
on other occasions. Fritto Misto's biggest seller is the Cajun seared chicken: 
fiery blackened chicken chunks and a rich, bland garlic cream on, yes, 
falling-apart red bell pepper fettucine.  
</P>
<P>
 Each strand of black and white pasta is two-toned and far more resilient than 
the other pastas: Served with plump, sweet shrimp in garlic butter, this pasta 
seems like a chewy, shredded seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner, which started out so felicitously with fritto misto and salads, was 
now mired in enormous plates of disappointing pasta. All around us people were 
tucking into the same food with relish -- surely, one of life's mysteries. 
Still, the party of five left happy, thanks to absolutely perfect banana cream 
pie: cold, with flaky crust, fresh bananas, mild custard, unsweetened whipped 
cream.

 * Fritto Misto , 601 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica , (310) 458-2829. Open for 
lunch Monday through Saturday. Open for dinner 7 days. Beer and wine served. 
Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only $24-$52.

THEATER BEAT: 'DYLAN' EVOKES STUNNING IMAGE OF POET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Awash in alcohol, the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas died on the cusp of 40 
during his 1953 lecture tour of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Dylan," playwright Sidney Michaels propounded that the reason for Thomas' 
spectacular self-destruction was the stellar American success that lured him 
away from his quiet writer's life in Wales. A revival of "Dylan" at the 
Skylight is a stunning, sprawling evocation of those turbulent months before 
Dylan's untimely death in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The play opens with a knockdown, drag-out brawl between Thomas (Dave Higgins) 
and his tempestuous wife Caitlin (Pat Destro) on the eve of Thomas' departure 
for his inaugural U.S. tour. Never one to pull a punch or mince a word, Caitlin 
is her husband's mettlesome muse, although she fears, rightly so, that the 
looming shadow of the American continent will permanently eclipse her influence 
over Thomas. Part seraph, part harpy, Caitlin does "rage, rage" against the 
dying of her light, and Destro finds the perfect balance between her fury and 
her tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Robert Walden does a formidable balancing act as well, handling the 
logistic difficulties of a large cast and numerous set changes with the pacing 
and panache of a big-budget Broadway musical director while never sacrificing 
the intellectual content of the piece. There's not a weak link in this cast, 
which also features Michael Kaplan, Michael Durrell, Sibel Ergener, Rachel 
Mass, David Alexander, Elaine Giftos and Jerry Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins' performance in the title role is the most agile balancing act of all. 
His Welsh dialect may occasionally go astray, but it's a minor flaw in an 
otherwise perfect performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dylan," Skylight Theatre, 1816 1/2 N. Vermont Ave., Hollywood. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8; Sunday, 7. Ends Oct. 16. $20. (213) 660-8587. Running 
time: 2 hours, 55 minutes. A 'Choice' View of Conformity 
</P>
<P>
 "Beguiled by Choice," two one-acts at Moving Arts, share a common theme about 
how society's pressure to conform creates a drag on the human spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The opener, "The Goddess of My Heart" by Kerry Madden-Lunsford, is a slight 
but entertaining tidbit about a middle-aged woman whose obsession for k.d. lang 
threatens not only her marriage but her previously unquestioned values. 
</P>
<P>
 Engaging but hyperkinetic, P.B. Hutton (who alternates in this one-woman show 
with Glenda Chism) needs to ease up a notch on her delivery. Still, one feels a 
genuine affection for her scrappy, sassy housewife and suspects that she will 
eventually blunder onto the path of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no such intimation of a happy ending in Kevin Barry's "I Will Love You 
at 8 P.M. Next Wednesday," which chronicles an ongoing sexual relationship 
between two ostensibly "straight" men. The play has been sensitively directed 
by Joseph Mustacchi, who also directed the first piece.  
</P>
<P>
 Bobby (Stuart McLean) and Mitch (Al Sapienza, alternating in the role with 
Kevin Vickery) are buttoned-down corporate types who have spent their adult 
lives systematically deceiving their wives, their families and their 
conservative business associates about their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean and Sapienza give the effectively underplayed performances of men 
accustomed to routinely curbing their natural impulses. Barry's play is an 
uncomfortable, vivid illustration of secret lives and desperate machinations. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Beguiled by Choice," Moving Arts, 1822 Hyperion Blvd., Silver Lake. 
Thursday-Saturday, 8. Ends Oct. 1. $12. (213) 665-8961. Running time: 1 hour, 
40 minutes. 'Women': A Look at Actress Ellen Terry 
</P>
<P>
 "Wonderful Women," British actress Eunice Roberts' one-woman show on the life 
of the Victorian actress Ellen Terry, at Playwrights' Arena, is presented in 
conjunction with the UK/LA Festival. The play flashes back and forth in time 
between the elderly Terry on her last American tour in 1915 and a more youthful 
Terry expounding on her trade at the lecture podium. 
</P>
<P>
 As a performer, Roberts displays subtlety and talent. As playwright, however, 
she lacks the powers of dramatic invention and synthesis that would have 
enlivened Terry's eventful life. 
</P>
<P>
 A renowned wit in her own right and a member of a great theatrical dynasty, 
Terry was both celebrated and notorious, but her many marriages and turbulent 
romances are only alluded to elliptically in what becomes more an exegesis of 
Terry's Shakespearean acting methods than a vibrant re-creation of the famous 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wonderful Women," Playwrights' Arena, 5262 Pico Blvd., Los Angeles. 
Sundays-Mondays, 8 p.m. Ends Oct. 2. $10. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 hour,

ART REVIEW; EDWARD HAGEDORN AT COUTURIER: THE FEMALE NUDE MADE BENIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manet flattened his nudes into icons, as if with an ironing board. Picasso 
turned his into strange hybrids, as bloated as beach balls or as tentacular as 
octopuses.De Kooning fractured his women with a painterly glee, bordering on 
sadism. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether idealized and ornamented or slashed and trashed, the female nude has 
been put through the wringer by the artist-architects of Modernism. For Edward 
Hagedorn, the Bay Area painter best known for his social and political 
commentaries, the female nude was likewise an obsessive motif, one the artist 
concentrated on exclusively during the last decades of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 At Couturier Gallery, a selection of Hagedorn's watercolors, drawings and 
prints from 1920 to '40 reveals the extent to which Hagedorn seized upon the 
nude in order to process the experiments of the European avant-garde, while 
softening some of the avant-garde's sharper edges. 
</P>
<P>
 One elongated nude recalls Modigliani's attenuated forms. The spareness of 
another pays homage to the economy of Matisse's line. A small pastel of a woman 
leaving the bath conjures Degas' many drawings on the same theme, although 
Hagedorn eschews the deliberately awkward angles and irregular vantage points 
that made Degas' imagery so revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nudes suggest that Hagedorn was held in thrall by German Expressionism. 
Yet, he exploits the decorative aspects of the style rather than its emotional 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hagedorn's nudes are strongly characterized by an academicized 
competence. They are inoffensive, quite pleasing, but in the end somewhat too 
benign to sustain anything other than historical interest. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; STEIN IN TRIUMPHANT READING OF SCHOENBERG IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ironically, the music of Arnold Schoenberg is arguably among the least 
encountered in this city, where he lived from 1934 until his death in 1951. 
Thus, Leonard Stein's performance of the composer's complete piano works was 
automatically a special event. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein's recital, Tuesday night at the Neighborhood Church in Pasadena, 
adjacent to the Gamble House, kicked off the venturesome four-concert "Piano 
Spheres" series. Not coincidentally, it took place on the 120th birthday of a 
composer who put ample stock in the power of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Complete works," in this case, isn't as daunting a prospect as it might seem. 
Schoenberg's spartan repertory of piano music relies on haunting brevity and 
concentrated doses of both intensity and introspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, a Schoenberg protege and longtime champion, brought a lived-in, 
hands-on expertise to this demanding body of work. Often hunched intently over 
the keyboard, Stein proceeded to exact, by memory, a measured delivery of the 
restless-yet-reflective piano scores that Schoenberg wrote between 1909 and 
1931. Most important, Stein made this music sing, in an objective, 
anti-romantic way. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some of the evening's most memorable music came not from Schoenberg, 
but from his early disciple, Anton Webern. The exquisitely arid tone poetry of 
his 1935 work Variations for Piano, Opus 27, embodies a refinement of the 
serial vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, a world premiere of "Mono/Poly," by Schoenberg's last private 
pupil, Richard Hoffmann, fared badly by association. Its maze of clever 
post-impressionistic washes allowed no detectable link to the atonal nature of 
the remainder of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the clustering fury of the row-master's Suite for Piano, Opus 25, 
came around to close the program, the subsequent ovation was well in order.

ART REVIEW; A BIGGER MESSAGE IN 'BIG PRINT' EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This century found itself confronted by the most crucial of human issues. The 
question was, which would dominate, the mind-set of the collective or that of 
the individual? It was a central theme for fine artists, who are individualists 
by definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the time winds down, it appears the big guys won. Soviet communism 
collapsed, to be sure, but its urge to homogenize remained rampant in 
corporations and the media. Even though today's popular retreat into 
subcultural groups seems fragmenting, from the point of view of the 
individualist, it is collectivist in character. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arts, Walt Disney and Hugh Hefner loom larger than Andy Warhol or Allen 
Ginsberg. But so what? Isn't there a place for singular souls in the chinks 
between the massive granite slabs of a monolithic culture? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably -- but according to "The Big Print," a traveling exhibition of 
lithographs on view at USC's Fisher Gallery, that chink is neither large nor 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was organized by New York University art administrator Leonard Lehrer 
and Ernst Quensen, proprietor of the German lithographic workshop that produced 
the large prints. This sampling includes some 40 sheets by 20 artists. More 
than a dozen countries are represented, but more than half the artists are 
German. Their traditional passion for punchy draftsmanship sets the tone. Most 
images are figurative, exaggerated and inclined to either satire or Angst . 
</P>
<P>
 At a glance the show radiates a nice cheery '60s glow. The catalogue has a 
reflective mylar cover typical of the hectic cool of the epoch and its 
promotion of lithography as a fine art medium under the banner of "Art for the 
People." The assembled work evokes the animation of "Yellow Submarine" and the 
wonderful surreal graphics of "Beyond the Fringe." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few minutes of viewing brings on the feeling that something went 
seriously sour in the meantime. Virtually no artist here seems to try anything 
that he, she or art in general hasn't done before. The Brit Allen Jones' kinky 
Pop imagery was bracingly irreverent 30 years ago. Today his "One Night Stand" 
is like a nostalgic tune played in a piano bar. Germany's Johannes Grutzke 
confronts us with the powerful image of a male nude in Lucifer's embrace, but 
the composition is a frank gloss on the great Expressionist posters of the 
Weimar era. Paris-based Czech artist Ruth Francken shows a collective portrait 
of art heroes like Samuel Beckett and Joseph Beuys that is so frankly in 
emulation of Andy Warhol it's clear she doesn't care if we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 A clue is provided by Michael Mathias Prechtl's offering. It includes a 
disturbed group of illustrative figures. In one corner a levitating Einstein 
plays the fiddle. In the other Groucho tries to read his newspaper while a kid 
dances to his Walkman and a man in high heels grimaces behind his camcorder 
urged on by Mickey Mouse. Everybody is tangled in wires ending in microphones 
and telephones leading to the central figure. It is a computer with sexy legs 
whose monitor shows the face of a Marilyn Monroe-style blond. The piece is 
titled "mixed media." It says that everybody including fine artists have 
succumbed to the seductions of the collectivist electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pop era, fine artists celebrated graphic design. Graphic artists 
responded gleefully by imitating innovations introduced by the fine artists. 
Fine artists then imitated themselves being imitated by the media until the 
whole thing turned into one vast cultural copying machine copying itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In such an ambience, it's tough to maintain lithography's status as a fine 
arts media. It looks too much like reproduction. This blurring of the boundary 
between art and graphics created a serious identity pickle for a certain stripe 
of individual artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Images like those by Gerd Winner and Cinda Sparling may have their roots in 
Cubism, but today they look like stills swiped from polite computer-generated 
graphics seen on PBS. A German neo-Expressionist like Jorg Immendorff may have 
rescued something important from the ash heap of history in reviving a style of 
itchy drawing, but today's audience feels as if they've already seen it on MTV 
or "Beavis and Butt-head." There is a tendency to be disappointed in this art 
because it doesn't move. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few ways out of this impasse. Artists can continue to cling to the 
idea that they are different by staying inside their subculture, working in 
traditional media like paint and bronze and cultivating wealthy collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime just copping an attitude does the trick. Malte Sartorius' still-life 
of a basket of onions does it, so does Leonard Lehrer's view of a formal garden 
at night. These guys are so frankly out of it with their dreamy realism they 
positively invite the anonymity of the true romantic individualist. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who wants to fit in has to deal with reality. The Cold War Era and the 
civilization that went with it are guttering out. A new kind of art has to come 
of Neo-collectivism, just as one came out of post-World War II culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The new signal is clear. You can be an outlaw graffiti writer, or you can take 
your portfolio to an art director who will put you on a team to make multimedia 
music videos or animated musicals seen by millions. They won't know your name 
but, hey, who knows who built the Gothic cathedrals? 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; DELUXE 'SILENCE' LASER QUITE TALKATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I like the movie a lot, and it astonishes me that I made it. Wow, I learned 
something after the last 20 years. I learned how to make a picture." So says 
director Jonathan Demme with great understatement at the end of the narrative 
track accompanying the just-released Criterion laser disc of the terrifying 
1991 psychological thriller "The Silence of the Lambs." 
</P>
<P>
 Criterion also knows how to make a laser disc. This fascinating two-disc set 
($100)is no exception. It includes a sound track with insightful commentary 
from the Oscar-winning best picture film's Academy Award winners: director 
Demme; actors Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster and screenwriter Ted Tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Their observations, along with knowledgeable details from FBI Behavioral 
Science Unit Director John Douglas, follow the film along its unrelenting 
118-minute course. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterboxed to its theatrical aspect ratio and presented in spectacular THX 
picture and digital sound that is as important to this film as the full images, 
Criterion's "Silence" comes at you with no holds barred. (A previous 
Orion/Image laser release, still available at $35, is not letterboxed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cinematographer Tak Fujimoto consulted on the digital transfer. Howard Shore's 
frightening score, which seemingly ferrets sound from the bowels of the Earth, 
can chill your blood in your own living room, enveloping you as surely as 
Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) dominates his surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are deleted, or alternate versions of several key scenes, 
culled from Demme's personal VHS copy of his March 16, 1990, cut. Before the 
film opened, interest in the film version of the Thomas Harris bestseller ran 
high and, the laser-disc producers report, "pirated VHS cassettes began 
appearing on the bootleg market." Because of this, "all high-quality 
assemblages of the film in its developmental stages were destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the deleted scenes were considered "important archival records of the 
creative process," Demme's remaining VHS copy was used for this edition, even 
though "the quality of the image is degraded." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven deleted scenes make fascinating comparisons to the final version of 
the film: some ramble, some expand or enhance our understanding of the complex 
psychological makeup of the film's singular characters and the story line. 
Accompanying instructions lead you directly to the relevant chapter stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supplemental material includes essays about the stars and director by 
Pauline Kael, B. Ruby Rich and Lucy Hughes-Hallet. For crime buffs fascinated 
with the workings of the FBI and its tracking of serial killers, there are 
reprints of Kessler, Burgess, Burgess and Douglas' "Crime Classification Manual 
Profiling Techniques," detailing organized sexual homicide; disorganized sexual 
homicide; mixed sexual homicide, and sadistic homicide, along with "Voices 
Inside Their Heads," an excerpt from Michael Newton's book on serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jodie Foster came to the project, knowing that she was "second choice," but 
believing that the film's hero, Clarice Starling, "fit into my mythology of a 
female hero." In fact, Starling is "probably my most favorite character I've 
ever played," she reports.  
</P>
<P>
 For Anthony Hopkins, "the scene that grabbed me . . . was the very first 
scene. That's the one I latched the whole performance on." He saw Lecter, the 
brilliant psychiatrist locked away as a cannibal, "as a killing machine, a man 
locked in the monstrosity of his mind, a clinical killer." 
</P>
<P>
 One delicious moment comes when Hopkins explains how he came up with the 
slurping sound he uses early in the film. Everyone was surprised when they saw 
him do it and so they kept it in the film. Hopkins remembers thinking of Bela 
Lugosi's Dracula as he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Demme's only regret is that he didn't underscore "the child abuse that lurks 
at the core" of the film's serial killers. The only down side to this excellent 
laser package is that the white type on the inside and back cover of the album 
is very hard to read against a background of photographs from the film. The 
package looks good until you try reading the important information contained on 
the three sides. This is one time Criterion should have opted for clarity over 
"artistic" presentation.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; VIDEO TREND: PRE-SELLING OF TV SHOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the marketing ploys in home video these days just don't make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Take "Baseball," for instance, Ken Burns' 18 1/2-hour homage to the national 
pastime, which starts Sunday on PBS and ends on Sept. 28. Next Friday, after 
the series has been on TV for five days, the nine-tape set comes out on home 
video, from Turner Home Entertainment -- priced at $180 for the set or $25 for 
each individual tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't you think a video release in the middle of the series would cut down 
on the TV ratings? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Eric Sass, PBS' senior vice president of video marketing: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our experience shows that availability in the video store does not affect the 
ratings. That's because the broadcast audience is so much larger than the video 
audience. Millions will see it on TV but how many will spend nearly $200 to buy 
the whole set? In this case, video availability may even help ratings. Some 
people may tune in to preview it before making the decision to buy it, which 
would actually boost ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that video availability won't hurt TV ratings is undoubtedly the 
thinking behind Republic's plan to send its production of "Texas," based on the 
James Michener novel, to video even before it's aired on TV. Priced at $50, 
"Texas" is due in stores Nov. 2 but won't be telecast on ABC until early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another aspect of the "Baseball" scheduling doesn't make sense. If people can 
see it on TV -- and possibly tape it -- why should they bother with the video? 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't necessarily work that way," countered Craig Van Gorp, Turner's 
vice president of sales. "The TV show may lift video sales. Many people who buy 
'Baseball' will be buying it as a gift. It will be firmly established in the 
home-video marketplace when people are doing their Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also another reason seeing it on TV may help it in the video market," 
Van Gorp continued. "It's a long series. People may not have time to watch it 
all on TV and don't want to bother taping something that runs so long. It's 
easier for those people to buy the set or at least some of the individual 
tapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner and PBS aren't exactly at odds in this situation. Sass pointed out that 
PBS gets a share of the video revenues. "It's not like Turner is putting out 
the video at a time to only help themselves -- because it helps us too," he 
said. "This is simply the smartest way to market the video." 
</P>
<P>
 PBS learned a lesson from what happened with Burns' last series, "The Civil 
War." That one, Sass said, debuted on video four months after the telecast. "We 
learned we're better off having it in the stores at the time of broadcast," he 
said. "When people want to buy it they should be able to get it. There was a 
market for the video about the time the show was on TV. If we had put it on 
video at the same time it was on TV or just after, we would have sold many more 
sets." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the season-ending baseball strike? Will that hurt or harm 
"Baseball" on TV? Right now many fans aren't too thrilled with the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hard one to call, but we don't think there will be a negative effect," 
Sass replied. "This show is largely a look back to better times for baseball, 
which many fans might like to do at a time like this. Also, some people may 
watch because it's the only baseball they can see right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Videobits 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed," the surprise hit of the summer, is speeding to home market on Nov. 
15. FoxVideo will price it for the sales market -- $20. So far it's the lone 
action-thriller in this price range scheduled for fall release, so it should 
have that market all to itself. Executives expect to ship between 8 million and 
12 million cassettes.  
</P>
<P>
 One of John Wayne's most popular Westerns is finally coming to home video. 
"Hondo," made in 1953, is due on Tuesday, priced at $20. This and FoxVideo's 
"An Affair to Remember" should be the fall's best-selling classic movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Tandy 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jessica Tandy's death last weekend, much of the media attention has 
focused on her Oscar-winning film "Driving Miss Daisy." "Fried Green Tomatoes," 
which was a huge box-office and video hit a few years ago, has been unfairly 
neglected. Tandy does the best acting in this absorbing, complexly structured, 
nearly all-female drama that spans many decades. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a glimpse of Tandy early in her career, try to find Paramount's 
"September Affair" from 1950. This is a very romantic and underappreciated 
drama about a wealthy married man (Joseph Cotten) and a concert pianist (Joan 
Fontaine) who decide to live together in Italy. Tandy plays the wife who's 
cruelly left behind. The romance is enhanced by the glorious footage of Italy 
-- mainly Florence and Capri -- and the haunting "September Song," which 
dominates the soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New On Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Crow" (Miramax). Dark, eerie, surrealistic horror-thriller based on a 
comic-book character. A rock musician (Brandon Lee), who was murdered with his 
fiancee, comes back to life to track down the killers, helped by an 
otherworldly crow. Lee, who was killed in a freak accident during the last days 
of filming, is riveting as the tortured avenger. With its moody, 
alternative-metal score, it's terrific entertainment for 
gloom-and-doom-oriented teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threesome" (Columbia TriStar). A college comedy about roommates locked in an 
unconventional triangle. A female student (Lara Flynn Boyle) longs for a 
scholar (Josh Charles) who in turn is attracted to a macho-man (Stephen 
Baldwin) who's set his sights on Boyle. As you might expect in a Hollywood 
movie, the gay subplot is handled superficially. Otherwise, though, a decent 
comedy geared to late teens and twentysomethings.

TV REVIEW; PROMISING SERIES STILL 'UNDER SUSPICION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question to Detective Rose Phillips: "What's it like being the only woman 
among these men?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reply: "The toilet seat is always up." 
</P>
<P>
 Crisp dialogue is a strength of the new CBS cop series, "Under Suspicion." As 
is Karen Sillas as Phillips, the only female in a police squad room, and thus 
the predictable butt of coarse jokes from some of her cruder male colleagues. 
As a character who wants to fit in with the boys without becoming one, Sillas 
is first rate. 
</P>
<P>
 These are optimistic signs for "Under Suspicion," one of the more promising 
newcomers in a largely undistinguished fall season. Here is a series with at 
least potential for growth, and a cast, including Seymour Cassel as Phillips' 
boss, to help it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the premiere also suffers from pothole-sized script flaws and a 
questionable approach to Phillips -- from wardrobe to camera shots -- that at 
times undermines Sillas' good work. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the episode, Phillips is jolted by the disappearance of her partner, 
Frank Fusco (Peter Onorati), then by news that she's being reassigned as the 
police department's "women's coordinator." She resists, but it's a done deal, 
making her a receptacle for sexual harassment and other gender-related charges 
from female uniformed officers. Phillips' own subconscious demons surface -- is 
she overcompensating? -- when she's arbitrarily cool to one officer's claim 
that her partner has been coming on to her. Very nice. 
</P>
<P>
 On another level, though, you're way ahead not only of the story but also of 
the cops who are so baffled by Fusco's disappearance. They are unable to deduce 
what any viewer will be able to figure out merely by paying attention. And 
later, when detectives uncover an eyewitness who describes a murderous rogue 
cop as wearing a shoulder holster, no one asks the witness an obvious critical 
question, whether the killer was white or black. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On still another front, compare "Under Suspicion" to the subtler moves of 
those extraordinary "Prime Suspect" miniseries on PBS, where strong-willed 
Detective Jane Tennison is put in charge of male detectives, many of whom 
resent having a female boss. Although a highly sexual person (at one point she 
has a hot fling with another detective), Tennison strategically dresses down on 
the job, wearing relatively conservative suits that don't attract attention to 
her gender. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that the especially good-looking Phillips would do the same after 
repeatedly fending off obnoxious sexist comments from some of the men around 
her. Yet she wears tight miniskirts, presumably enticing the very oglers she 
wants to discourage. It would be her right to dress like that, and her attire 
would never justify lewd or sexist comments. But a smart cop trying to fit in 
would use a smarter strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think this is incidental, consider a couple of executive producer 
Robert Lieberman's choices as director of the first episode. At one point, he 
opts for a seductive front shot of Phillips walking toward us in her miniskirt. 
Another time, he shoots her by starting the camera low and panning up her body. 
It's gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect the director seems to be working at cross purposes with 
Sillas, whose performance as Phillips is nothing if not controlled. Here's 
hoping that control rubs off. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Under Suspicion" premieres at 9 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

SCOTT HARRIS: THE LITTLE GIRL WITH THE OUTRAGEOUS IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS9/16/94 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, a precocious little girl sat in a classroom in New Jersey 
and sadly learned that the Earth was becoming too crowded. Overpopulation, she 
was told, was fouling the air and water. The planet was at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the solution dawned on little Blenda Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I developed a fabulous, brilliant theory that everybody over 50 should be 
killed," she recalls, laughing. "If you could imagine, I was 12 or 13, and 50 
was just real old. And I touted it. I talked about it. . . . It was with a 
passion that I had this great theory." 
</P>
<P>
 Blenda Wilson, 53, today is the president of California State University, 
Northridge, occupying handsome but temporary quarters on the quake-damaged 
campus. It wasn't clear where her story was heading. We were supposed to be 
discussing the latest social tremor to strike Cal State Northridge: a protest 
by the Black Student Union (BSU) over the hiring of a white instructor to teach 
basic English skills in the Pan African Studies Department. The students 
contended that Katherine Komis, because she is white, lacked the cultural 
understanding necessary to teach in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was Wilson getting at? Was she comparing the BSU's complaints to the 
folly of a child? Would the students find her words patronizing? Was she 
dissing the students? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The short answer is no, and readers unfamiliar with Wilson should probably be 
informed that she is black. When she was inaugurated as the Cal State 
Northridge president in April, 1993, Wilson became the nation's only African 
American woman to head a university serving more than 25,000. In a better 
world, a world where people are judged by the content of their character, her 
race might be irrelevant. But Cal State Northridge is not located in that 
promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap over the hiring of Komis marks the third time during Wilson's tenure 
that ethnic tension has put the campus in headlines. In early 1993, Wilson 
addressed an angry crowd of mostly Latino students who were protesting the 
reinstatement of a predominantly Anglo fraternity. The frat had been suspended 
for violating school racism codes for a party flyer featuring lyrics to a 
drinking song that refer to a fictional Mexican prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Wilson's office monitored a feud between Jewish and black students 
over the BSU's sponsorship of a lecture by Louis Farrakhan, the controversial 
Nation of Islam minister known for anti-Semitic remarks. After a BSU leader 
wrote a letter accusing Jewish students of "Hitlerian tactics" for scheduling 
an alternative event during Farrakhan's talk, Wilson issued a statement 
declaring the letter "insulting and disrespectful to Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's visit commemorated the 25th anniversary of a CSUN protest that 
helped lead to the establishment of the Pan African Studies Department. Today, 
debate still rages over ethnic studies programs and whether they serve to 
divide or enrich our multicultural society. The recent BSU protest, such a 
slow-moving target, did critics a favor. In a society where many object to 
"affirmative action" hiring policies, in a sensitive age in which a mild ethnic 
observation may elicit charges of racism, here was a group of black activists 
flatly advocating discrimination against whites. Critics took aim in letters to 
various newspapers, accusing BSU members of bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson received correspondence as well. "The letters that disturb me the 
most," she says, "are those that would suggest that some terrible crime was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than condemn the protest, Wilson's administration said it was 
interested in the students' views but disagreed with their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson suggests the students' dissent is typical and healthy on a college 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had there not been people who were unpopular . . . some of the 
accomplishments we've made would not have been achieved," she said. The young 
"should be questioning the kind of world we created for them. . . . That 
doesn't mean they're going to be right every time they raise it. But if they 
didn't raise it, our society would be in peril, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But back to little Blenda's plan to save the world. What was her point, 
anyway?  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course my family and friends thought I was totally nuts. And yet they 
didn't act like I was a genocidal maniac." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Blenda Wilson's notions for saving the world involve civil rights 
and civility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tolerance," she says, "is not something that is taught only in a course on 
ethics. It's taught by how we behave daily on the campus toward one another. . 
. . Those are things that we teach day to day by what we expect and how we live 
together in the community. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You can disagree with the idea," she adds, "without attributing bad motive 
and ill character to these students."

LAPD REFORM: THE CHIEF'S HONEYMOON IS OVER; MAYOR WORRIES, WILLIAMS MAKES A 
MOVE AND TOP AIDE GOES -- IS REFORM ALIVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All is not well in police-reform land. The wisdom and clear sense of direction 
contained in the Christopher Commission recommendations suddenly seem clouded 
by controversy, bubbling ill will and surfacing doubt about Los Angeles Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams' 18-month-old stewardship. City Hall, right up to the 
mayor himself, is known to be concerned, and of course the City Council is 
having its say. The net result is substantial concern about the future of 
reform in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 CHIEF WILLIAMS: City Hall is worried about this veteran law enforcement 
professional mainly because Williams -- who was hired from Philadelphia by 
then-Mayor Tom Bradley after the 1992 riots -- appears to have made so little 
progress in getting control of the deeply encrusted LAPD bureaucracy. This is 
certainly true; however, that task might not be one for a mere mortal, even if 
Williams had many levers with which to massage and maneuver and lead the LAPD. 
He doesn't. City Hall needs to understand this, keep pressing and give Williams 
the support he needs: It must keep its cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the leverage situation changed at least somewhat the other day when 
Williams demoted his No. 2 and created a new assistant chief's position that he 
could fill with someone more to his liking as his alter ego. That was the right 
move to make, even though Williams handled it about as daintily as a middle 
linebacker. The dumpee -- Deputy Chief Bernard C. Parks -- is a talented police 
professional and widely respected. Even so, it is Williams and no one else who 
at the end of his five-year term will be held accountable for the LAPD reforms 
and everything else and thus is manifestly entitled to his own team; everyone, 
including Parks and any second-guessers on the City Council, must respect that. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY HALL: It is refreshing to see a mayor actually involved in the governance 
of the city; not so long ago Los Angeles had a mayor and a police chief who 
felt their paychecks didn't even require them to talk with each other. 
Regarding the LAPD, Mayor Richard Riordan's continuing commitment to both 
reform and community policing is to be applauded and supported. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there is one nagging worry about the mayor, it is that this energetic 
but sometimes impatient man tends to equate getting things done in the private 
sector, where the boss issues a command and people (usually) jump, with getting 
things done in the public sector, where the rank-and-filers, safely in the womb 
of civil service, figure (usually) they're going to outlast the boss and do as 
little as possible in the meantime. If Riordan thinks dealing with the City 
Hall bureaucracy is tricky, he should switch desks with Williams for a few days 
and see how tough it is at the LAPD. Patience, Mr. Mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 POLICE COMMISSION: Riordan's still relatively freshly appointed Police 
Commission hasn't come into its own yet. There's certainly no reason to write 
it off at this point. In fact, we're reliably informed that the commission 
expects to have an important new position up and running soon. That's the 
office of inspector general, a function strongly recommended by the 1992 
Christopher Commission report to monitor progress of the LAPD reforms. It's 
almost two years down the road now and the City Council still hasn't gotten 
this done. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Commission believes that this new office can advance the reform 
process within the LAPD in the way the Kolts Commission has done for the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department -- by issuing public reports on what's 
gotten better and what hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kolts people have been doing a great job with these semiannual reports, 
which are issued whether anyone likes it or not and which are notable for their 
independence, clarity and positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Commission must provide the same periodic report cards: There would 
be no better proof that LAPD reform isn't withering on the vine.

THIS TIME THEY'RE SERIOUS (RIGHT); GORE'S TEAM HAS DONE GOOD FAT-FINDING WORK 
-- BUT IS CAMPAIGN SUSTAINABLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the part of the old joke that goes something like this: "I'm from the 
government and I'm here to help you"? Vice President Al Gore isn't laughing but 
he does have reason to smile. He's saying the size of the federal government 
can be reduced, and also work better. And not everyone is smirking derisively; 
that alone is an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrinking the federal work force is difficult, given the job-for-life 
protections provided by civil service, politics or pork. But Gore's team has 
forged a measure of cooperation among the White House, Congress, federal 
officials and public workers during the first year of the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first anniversary of the Administration's National Performance Review, 
President Clinton claimed that by shaving 71,000 positions from the federal 
work force the White House would create a savings of $47 billion next year. If 
true -- if the savings even remotely resembled that -- this represents real 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The stated goal -- $108 billion in savings and a reduction of 250,000 
government workers, which amounts to a 12% cut in the federal bureaucracy over 
five years -- sounded like a pipe dream when initially announced. It still 
might, but that mission doesn't seem so flatly unachievable, given Gore's 
incremental success. 
</P>
<P>
 By next March, 50,000 more government workers are expected to take federal 
buyouts. That exodus promises greater savings, unless, of course, the best and 
the brightest take the money and run, leaving behind ineffective employees. 
</P>
<P>
 More savings could come from suggestions offered by government employees, such 
as streamlining the cumbersome procurement process that often forces Washington 
to pay more for less. Reducing the size and expense of government is critical 
to the financial solvency of this nation, but these aren't the Administration's 
only goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's vision includes a government that works better to help deserving 
people, especially after a disaster, when people need government most. People 
like Almeda Holstein of Sylmar are already testifying. She lost her house, and 
just about everything else, in the Northridge earthquake. Her family was 
homeless for three weeks and worried about how to pay the mortgage. "FEMA 
rescued me," she said during the White House progress report on Wednesday. 
That's high praise for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which had 
delivered much less than promised in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Holstein also paid tribute to FEMA caseworker Bea Gonzales, who "was tireless 
in her efforts and kindly in her manner." Such competence and compassion must 
be rewarded more often. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of reinventing the federal government is far from over, but Al Gore 
has achieved a more than respectable start. Citizens should keep a cautious 
guard up at all times, of course -- but not rule out the possibility that Gore 
might actually accomplish something.

LET'S HOPE JUNTA WAS CONVINCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's speech explaining why U.S. military forces may soon have 
to invade Haiti was effective -- but only up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton offered apparently heartfelt arguments to convince the American public 
that the military clique that controls Haiti is a threat not just to its 
forlorn people but also to this country.He painted a vivid and grisly picture 
of the military and police there: After ousting Haiti's first democratically 
elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, three years ago, the Cedras regime 
instituted such crude brutality that thousands of Haitians have fled to the 
United States as illegal immigrants. Clinton also pointed out that the United 
States and other nations have tried peaceful means to get Haiti's illegitimate 
rulers to leave so Aristide can return. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President did not say enough about what will happen after the Haitian 
junta is gone -- especially if it is forced out by U.S. arms. In that case, 
will this country be faced with a new burden -- rebuilding Haiti's democracy 
and economy so that a U.S. intervention there will never be necessary again? 
</P>
<P>
 That is what worries the many Americans who have no sympathy for dictators but 
are concerned about the burdens this country will be assuming if it again 
becomes the policeman of the Caribbean, as it so often tried to be in the early 
part of this century, with so little success. 
</P>
<P>
 They now can only hope Clinton's speech was more convincing to listeners in 
Haiti. Let's hope it prods Haiti's military dictators to accept a U.S. offer of 
safe passage out of the country if they abdicate. If the speech does that, it 
will have been successful indeed.

 * Re "Emergency Doctors Found Lacking Special Training," Sept. 8: 
</P>
<P>
 The article states that many emergency departments across the country are 
staffed by residents and/or physicians without adequate training to care for 
the many types of medical problems which confront emergency physicians. It says 
that only half of the nation's 25,000 jobs in emergency medicine are filled by 
doctors certified to provide emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 This picture is painted with far too broad a brush stroke. Our emergency 
department is staffed exclusively by board-certified specialists, including 
moonlighters. The same can be said for many of the emergency departments in 
Southern California. In addition, a large percentage of those doctors lacking 
certification have extensive training and experience. They have been unable to 
take the emergency medicine boards because of technical, bureaucratic reasons. 
Attempts are currently being made to develop an alternative certification 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that certifying practices for emergency departments are antiquated. 
Those departments that use highly qualified personnel should be credited for 
this and the information provided to the public. However, it must be remembered 
that the underlying reason less qualified physicians are used in some emergency 
departments is that many other medical specialties are more highly compensated 
while emergency room work is often more difficult, demanding and sometimes 
dangerous, as the shootings last year at L.A. County-USC Hospital showed.

INFLATION

 * Controlling inflation is in our best long-term interest. Inflation is an 
insidious, pernicious disease that erodes the financial foundation of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ills of inflation aren't readily apparent but that doesn't mean they are 
not destructive (letters, Sept. 7). Actual example: A retired couple sell their 
home in 1976 for $20,000 to move to a mobile home park. Three years later the 
buyer of their home resells it for $60,000 and the retired couple are having a 
tough time paying escalating ground rent for their mobile home. Meanwhile, 
investors dissatisfied with real estate returns are turning to the precious 
metal markets for quicker profits. And the silliness hit the low point when 
supposedly prudent people started investing in pyramids! Have we forgotten? 
We're lucky to have the Volckers and Greenspans who haven't.

 * Re "Potential U.S. Enemies Amass Advanced Arms," Sept. 4: We've heard a lot 
about our deficit and its effect upon our children. But why is there such 
resounding silence about the effect upon our children of the wanton and 
unrestrained sale of our most modern weapons and war systems? It is a dismal 
failure of our elected representatives that there have not been laws put into 
effect that bar such an idiotic, perhaps suicidal, absence of policy that 
permits our defense Establishment to sell the cutting edge of war technology to 
our potential enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Economy be damned if it means our children will face these weapon systems. 
With the new world order translating to engagement in regions far afield, with 
enemy nations declaring their hatred for us and the world as we know it, 
shouldn't we consider military engagement with one or all of them as 
inevitable? And, does our military want to face the best weapons that we 
develop? Can there be enough profit in the commerce of military hardware to 
neutralize the insanity of it?

 * The article mentions Russia and China as suppliers of the Third World's 
growing stockpiles of sophisticated weapons. But it fails to mention that the 
world's No. 1 international arms merchant is the United States. Since 1990, the 
U.S. has been the main supplier of arms to the Persian Gulf countries and to 
Asia, and it accounted for almost 60% -- more than $30 billion worth -- of all 
worldwide arms sales in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 These U.S. arms sales keep federal dollars flowing to the Pentagon, which in 
turn keeps many defense firms alive. But it has a disastrous effect on 
developing nations. And rather than exporting its democratic ideals, America 
sells 90% of its marketable arms to non-elected governments and dictatorships, 
fueling regional wars and arms races.

instructions which, being taught, return to plague the inventor. This

PERSPECTIVE ON VIOLENCE; A NATURAL-BORN MANIA FOR MAYHEM; A GOREFEST LIKE 
STONE'S NEW FILM ISN'T REALLY MORE BRUTAL THAN IN THE PAST; IT'S JUST MORE 
STATE OF THE ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAROLD SCHECHTER, Harold Schechter's most recent book is Depraved: The 
Shocking True Story of America's First Serial Killer, published this month by 
Pocket Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emerging -- or rather, staggering -- from the multiplex after seeing "Natural 
Born Killers," Oliver Stone's brain-bludgeoning attack on America's "culture of 
violence," I was put in mind, strangely enough, of the Bayeux Tapestry. This is 
not to draw an aesthetic comparison. The Bayeux Tapestry -- a 230-foot 
embroidery depicting William the Conqueror's invasion of England -- is one of 
the glories of Western art, a work of exquisite design and thrilling narrative 
power. By comparison, "Natural Born Killers" has all the grace and beauty of an 
M-1A assault rifle. Dispensing with the razor-edged wit of traditional satire, 
Stone goes for a more up-to-the-minute approach -- he tries to blow you away. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is a direct line of descent between the medieval masterpiece and 
Stone's in-your-face gangster film. The Bayeux Tapestry may be one of the 
world's artistic treasures, but it is also a work of sheer popular 
entertainment. A string of 58 sequential scenes, it is a kind of protomovie, 
packed with those crowd-pleasing ingredients that the viewing public has 
apparently always craved -- action, adventure and lots of graphic violence. 
Indeed, with its vivid scenes of warfare -- decapitations, disembowelings and 
assorted mutilations -- it is gorier than most R-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing the tapestry during a visit to Normandy last year, I was struck by the 
public's persistent taste for violent, action-packed entertainment. Clearly 
human beings have always taken delight in certain kinds of sensational stories 
and have constantly sought new and more exciting ways of bringing those stories 
to life. If the Bayeux Tapestry is a protomovie, it was the audience that 
provided the movement. Back in the Middle Ages, the tapestry was strung around 
the columns of the local cathedral; to get the full impact, the audience had to 
make a circuit of the church. Nowadays, all we have to do is sit back and let 
the action (and the killing) occur right before our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, in attacking the American public for its obsession with violence, 
Stone misses a crucial point. Our pop entertainments aren't necessarily more 
brutal than those of the past; they are simply (like our pornography) more 
state of the art. Between the embroidered bloodshed of the Bayeux Tapestry and 
the cinematic slaughter of contemporary shoot-'em-ups (including Stone's), the 
major difference is technological -- the method used to make the mayhem seem 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar point applies to the media's love affair with lurid crime -- another 
of Stone's sitting ducks. The sleaziest character in "Natural Born Killers" 
isn't Woody Harrelson's gun-crazy psycho or his sociopathic sweetheart but the 
unctuous host of a tabloid TV show called "American Maniacs." To see the 
commercial exploitation of murder as a uniquely contemporary phenomenon, 
however, is to suffer from a severe case of historical myopia. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly 100 years ago, for example, our country was riveted by the case of Dr. 
H. H. Holmes, the most notorious criminal of his day. Holmes (who appears 
peripherally in Caleb Carr's current bestseller, "The Alienist") was a Gilded 
Age serial killer -- or "multimurderer" in the jargon of the age -- who 
confessed to 27 homicides, though certain crime historians believe that the 
real number may have ranged into the hundreds. In my own research into his 
life, I was intrigued to discover that every phenomenon associated with our 
presumably dehumanized era existed a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the frenzied press coverage of his case, Holmes became a national 
celebrity. Hordes of curiosity-seekers ransacked his Chicago headquarters for 
souvenirs and mobbed the Philadelphia courtroom where his trial took place. 
Instant books were rushed into print ("Holmes, the Arch-Fiend" is a typical 
title). Holmes himself cashed in on his notoriety by publishing an 
autobiography and peddling his confessions to the papers (he reportedly 
received $5,000 from William Randolph Hearst, a handsome sum in 1890s dollars). 
</P>
<P>
 Even simulated re-creations of his crimes -- a staple of contemporary TV 
"infotainment" -- were staged. An enterprising impresario opened an "H. Holmes 
Museum," complete with dioramas depicting the "multimurderer" in action. In a 
move that might put even Stone's TV schlockmeister to shame, this same 
gentleman approached the Philadelphia prosecutor and offered to purchase the 
exhumed skull of one of Holmes' victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks preceding Holmes' execution, 4,000 applicants wrote to the warden 
of Moyamensing Prison, seeking tickets to the hanging. So intense was the 
public fascination with Holmes -- and the media coverage that fed it -- that, 
fearful of having his corpse stolen by some ghoulish huckster, he arranged to 
be buried in a coffin full of cement.  
</P>
<P>
 Following his death, entrepreneurs continued to exploit Holmes mania. The 
Edison Co., for example, issued a wax recording of Holmes' confessions for use 
on its marvelous new invention, the phonograph. 
</P>
<P>
 From embroidered cloth to wax cylinders to CNN -- we've come a long way in 
technological terms. But the public craving for violent diversion hasn't 
altered in a thousand years. Stone's film is a case in point. For all its 
righteous indignation, "Natural Born Killers" is another cinematic gorefest, 
distinguished by its pyrotechnics: old wine (blood-red, of course) in a new 
bottle.

 The cover of a magazine called Slick Times depicts the President as a pimp and 
the First Lady as a whore. No President in history has been attacked in such an 
unfair, ubiquitous and downright foul manner, of which Slick Times is just one 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 In this poisonous atmosphere, no distinction is made between personal attack 
and criticism of program or policy. If people are cynical now, the promulgation 
of slash-and-burn politics will cause even more to disengage from the political 
process. This will not help any President of any party; it will certainly not 
help our democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Our country needs more people like former Michigan governor William Milliken, 
a Republican, and Newton N. Minow, a Democrat, chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission during the Kennedy years. At a GOP meeting in May, 
Milliken spoke out against "zealots" in his party like Rush Limbaugh and Oliver 
North, whose "mendacity" he condemned. Minow endorses the revival of the 
Fairness Doctrine, the only way to ensure more even-handed media treatment of 
issues and the President. Only then will the polls truly reflect informed 
public opinion, rather than measuring the success of a campaign of propaganda.

COLUMN RIGHT/ BRUCE FEIN: IT COULD BE OUR FINEST HOUR; FREEING HAITI WOULD BE 
TRUE TO OUR IDEALS -- BUT ONLY IF WE ENSURE THAT DEMOCRACY THRIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE FEIN, Bruce Fein is a constitutional scholar in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be the nation's finest hour since the 1948 Berlin airlift. It would 
redeem the foreign military assistance received by the United States essential 
to throwing off the British yoke. And it would fulfill President John F. 
Kennedy's noble inaugural pledge to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any 
hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival 
and success of liberty." It is President Bill Clinton's impending overthrow of 
Haiti's military thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Thomas Jefferson eloquently wrote in the Declaration of Independence and 
Abraham Lincoln amplified in the Gettysburg Address, the moral spine of the 
United States is a devotion to fundamental human rights secured by the rule of 
law. Our citizens enjoy a first call on that devotion, but its glory is 
universal and ageless. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking through military force to bring the exhilarating benefits of democracy 
and democratic freedoms to peoples in foreign lands revitalizes our own 
democratic convictions and instills inestimable national pride. What other 
nation has ever risked lives but for parochial, narrow and self-interested 
motives? 
</P>
<P>
 A Haitian invasion to oust the incumbent despots would not be worth the 
candle, however, unless the United States contemplates a military occupation 
until institutions of democracy and liberty are entrenched. It is morally 
unjustifiable for a single American soldier to die in the name of replacing a 
Hitler with a Stalin. That means the objective of the invasion must be more 
than the reinstatement of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose devotion to 
freedom and the rule of law are suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide was popularly elected, but that is an insufficient credential of 
legitimacy. Adolf Hitler also catapulted to office with a plurality of German 
votes. Tyranny by the majority is tyranny nonetheless, a teaching that Aristide 
seems to scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 A military occupation force similar to those in West Germany and Japan 
following World War II should thus be installed in Haiti indefinitely after the 
invasion. Military law should prevail for two to three years while preparations 
are made for elections to a constitutional assembly empowered to draft a new 
constitution that enshrines principles of self-government and individual 
liberty. The United States would hold a veto power over any draft; a proposed 
constitution found acceptable would be subject to popular ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a military occupation plan is not visionary. It proved wildly successful 
in West Germany and Japan despite the absence of history or political culture 
conducive to the inauguration of democracy. To a lesser extent, the United 
States military more recently secured democracy in Grenada and Panama.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, to reject a military occupation force virtually guarantees 
a continuation of tyranny and lawlessness in Haiti with a change only in victim 
identities. A page of history is worth volumes of logic on that score. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States assisted the forcible ouster of communist, socialist or 
right-wing despots in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Chile (1973), Nicaragua 
(1980) and Afghanistan (1989), but was heedless of the aftermaths. All quickly 
succumbed to tyrannies equal to or worse than those displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral imperative for invading Haiti and installing a democratic regime is 
emphatically not a sufficient justification, standing alone, for action. 
Communist China, Cuba and other tyrannies worse than Haiti's abound, yet their 
invasions would not be justified because the risk of sizable American 
casualties would be too great. But in Haiti that risk is nil. Our casualties 
would probably be comparable to those incurred in military training exercises 
based on the Persian Gulf War experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, moreover, would directly benefit from a Haiti invasion and 
the installment of democracy. The enmities centered in Florida over would-be 
Haitian immigrants would subside or cease. In addition, the international 
credibility of the United States is at stake. If Clinton backs down from his 
invasion threat, other vicious regimes ranging from Libya to Iraq to North 
Korea are certain to remain intransigent. The world will become more safe for 
dictators but less safe for democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign policy guided solely by morality is rashness. But foreign policy will 
degenerate into soullessness if morality is not given at least a leading role.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: GETTING SET FOR A SPLENDID LITTLE WAR; CLINTON WAS 
RIGHT ON VIETNAM, SO WHY IN HAITI DOES HE WANT TO TAKE US DOWN THE SAME PATH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The feeling is inescapable that Bill Clinton is desperate for a splendid 
little war to win before the November congressional election. How else to 
explain his insistence on intruding into the affairs of Haiti? Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher admitted as much when he invoked the precedents of 
Grenada and Panama to justify the current war talk as well as the 
constitutionality of bypassing Congress. "The Republican presidents got to have 
their fun, why not us?" he might as well be saying. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reagan and Bush were wrong then and Clinton is wrong now. As Sen. George 
Mitchell said in 1990, when he blasted George Bush for attempting to go to war 
in the Gulf without a declaration from Congress: "The President has no 
authority, acting alone, to commit the United States to war." Now the 
Democratic leadership in Congress is awkwardly silent and Mitchell has even 
declared that "it's not legal or necessary" for the President to seek 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely Clinton knows better. Doesn't he remember that when he and millions of 
others opposed the war in Vietnam that they did so, in part, because Congress 
had not declared war? This was not some minor detail. They argued correctly 
that the failure to gain the approval of Congress defined the deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the war made sense, why was the case not made forthrightly and persuasively 
to the only branch of government constitutionally mandated to declare war? 
Instead, the deliberative body was consistently lied to by an executive branch 
that randomly changed the premise of its intervention to suit the needs of its 
own political survival. That's why those demonstrators, whom Clinton joined in 
London, termed the Vietnam War illegal and argued that no good purpose could be 
served by deceiving the public and the Congress by pretending that our troops 
were merely "advisers" involved in a "police action."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet those very words are now employed by Clinton to make a full-scale invasion 
of Haiti seem as benign as a voter-registration drive. Once again, we will use 
our fire power to impose a democratic alternative. Once again, we claim the 
role of "monitors" of another people's progress toward our promised land. And 
once again the "we," the American people, are kept in the dark about where all 
this is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy to say, as the President does, that all we care about is the restoration 
of democracy. But in Haiti, political and economic democracy cannot be 
separated. Aristide was elected with 70% of the vote on the promise that he 
would revolutionize Haitian society by destroying the wealthy oligarchy and 
sharing their wealth with the oppressed masses. Will we continue to support him 
if he attempts to make good on that noble promise? More likely he will be 
deposed and the United States will be ruling Haiti for the next 19 years as we 
did after the U.S. invasion of that country in 1920. What we bred was not 
democracy, but rather one of the most vicious dictatorships in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 We should not presume to control the destiny of Haiti, Somalia or any other 
country, because we are only playing at colonialism. At least our French, 
Spanish and English predecessors had serious plans for colonization that 
created an infrastructure of schools, churches, plantations and government. 
What we offer instead is an erratic commitment to poorly defined notions of 
democracy as long as the political decisions go our way. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we have a serious alternative model to offer Haiti, a country with 
resources so limited as to make Bangladesh look good? How much foreign aid are 
we prepared to put in and for how long? We have heard alarmingly little about 
how we intend to run Haiti after we conquer it. Before we get started, there 
should be a clear commitment from Congress, and through it the American people, 
as to the how much, how long and toward what end. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly Clinton is afraid to take his case to Congress because very few people 
in that body or in the larger public give a damn about Haiti. Sadly enough, the 
only real interest, outside of the Congressional Black Caucus, is to prevent 
Haitian refugees from landing on our shores. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is the case, Haiti does represent a bigger problem than Grenada ever 
did; Haiti does have more than 6 million people whereas the entire population 
of Grenada could have fled here and still have been accommodated in the Rose 
Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 But why treat the refugees as a threat? Why not simply welcome them as we did 
those fleeing Cuba, Vietnam and the former Soviet Union? How can we claim to 
care about the humanitarian needs of Haitians when we lock them up in camps or 
return them forcibly to the country they have fled? The fact is that we don't 
really care, which is why we should butt out.

Waffles," each dish a critique of her alleged position-switching. 
</P>
<P>
 Cute idea. So cute that the Clinton campaign launched it two years ago: a fake 
menu from "George Bush's Waffle House." 
</P>
<P>
 From the Bush menu: "George Bush will be happy to serve you . . . whatever you 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown menu: "Kathleen Brown will personally customize orders to fit any 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush menu: "Pay Raise Souffle" (Bush signs federal employee pay raise, then 
later proposes 5% cut for higher-earning workers). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown menu: "Sun Valley Souffle" (Brown bills taxpayers for part of several 
trips to her Idaho vacation home, reimbursing the state on the day she 
announced for governor). 
</P>
<P>
 Bush: "Sunny Side Up" (Bush saying one month that the country is not in a 
recession, then the next month saying, "We're in a global recession.") 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "California--Sunny Side Down" (her ads call her "America's Best 
Treasurer for America's Worst Economy") 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign menu does add Brown Plate Specials, "restaurant reviews" 
("big league waffling"--San Francisco Chronicle) and yummy drawings of waffles 
and pie.

 I have saved the best stuff of my generation . . . Stanford has bought all 
300,000 items in Beat poet Alan Ginsburg's collection, and what a haul it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The tennis shoes he was wearing when he got kicked out of Czechoslovakia. Old 
electric bills (presumably paid). Beard clippings. Dried vines. Oh yes, and 
some original manuscripts, correspondence with the likes of RFK and William 
Burroughs, and 400 or so journals begun when Ginsburg was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford is not telling the price it paid, but five years ago the collection 
was reputedly appraised at $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're as big as Ginsburg, they don't call it junk. They call it 
"archives."

 California's diversity shows up increasingly in the type of students who take 
the rigorous Scholastic Aptitude Test. Although the majority of college-bound 
seniors taking the 1994 SAT were native English-speakers, their numbers are 
declining. This shows the change since 1989 in the number of test-takers whose 
first tongue included a language other than English: 06,21,08,04,08,04,18 1989

 Double or nothing: The legislative session is over. You'd think they'd be sick 
of dealing with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren are still going 
at it over Lungren's office investigating a complaint that "casino night" games 
at Brown's annual end-of-session party constituted illegal gambling. (About 18 
California firms stage fund-raising "casino nights," Brown says, for clients 
from churches to law enforcement associations). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown concluded that Lungren must be miffed about not getting his 
comprehensive gambling control bill approved.  
</P>
<P>
 Even before mocking Lungren for saying the inquiry was undertaken by his staff 
without his knowledge--"I am reminded of a piece of wisdom imparted to me by my 
daddy many years ago: It is a poor workman . . . who blames his tools"--the 
Speaker had delivered an acid rebuke on the Assembly floor.  
</P>
<P>
 He was singled out, Brown said, because he opposed the gaming bill. "I guess," 
said the Speaker, "it was last done in Nazi Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Nazi-era moment that comes immediately to mind is when Claude 
Rains--Capt. Renault in "Casablanca"--closes down Rick's even as the croupier 
hands him his winnings.

 Now they can really call it a runway: Savaged for years by feminists and 
podiatrists, one high and mighty icon of the Miss America pageant has been 
spiked--the high-heeled pumps that competitors wore in the swimsuit 
competition. In Atlantic City on Saturday, contestants will parade in bare 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a former Miss California, Deanna Hardwick of Seal Beach, is already 
nostalgic. "For me, being of the old school, I'd feel it was unnatural not to 
have them. But let's face it, the swimsuit in the format that so many people 
view it is not natural anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 (Her "old school" was 1979--practically one pump in the grave.) EXIT LINE

hands are up in the air while I am getting a workout."

 Would you prefer sitting by a window or being sequestered?Two of the five 
booths in Mark Lifland's Westwood sandwich joint, Philly West,are labeled 
thusly:

<P>
 "No O.J. Section -- Conversations in this section are limited to any topic but 
O.J. Simpson."

 Explains Lifland: "I put it in about six weeks ago. I just kept hearing the 
same thing over and over again. There was never any news. Just one of two 
theories -- he did it or he didn't do it. . . . " 
</P>

 Lifland says the booths are often full of customers -- talking, we presume, 
about such topics as the origin of the universe.

 If you're a connoisseur of such Hollywood debacles, you may recall May 10, 
1988, the day disc jockey Rick Dees stationed himself on a Ventura Freeway 
overpass. Dees offered $100 to drivers who heard their cars described on the 
air and then drove to his mobile unit.

 The result: Multiple-lane-changing vehicles and a 15-mile backup.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; COMMITTED TO FIGHTING WAR ON 
DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A recent study released by the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization 
monitoring the nation's crime trends, stated that 61% of federal inmates and 
25% of all California state prisoners were convicted on drug-related charges. 
In 1983, the percentages were 27% and 7%, respectively. Some say that such 
dramatic increases can be linked to a series of new laws passed by Congress and 
state governments in the 1980s that called for stiff mandatory minimum prison 
terms for people convicted of selling or possessing narcotics. In connection 
with the study, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons predicted that by 1997, 70% of its 
inmates will be serving time for crimes involving drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we winning the war on drugs? 
</P>
<P>
 Clark Carr, executive director of Narconon Professional Detox Center 
</P>
<P>
 "My perception is that somewhere between 70% and 90% of criminals are arrested 
or in jail as a result of their being high on some kind of drug. Many of our 
clients have had to support their habits through various kinds of immoral 
activities. They are walking up the ladder of criminality to support an 
increasingly expensive habit. I'd like to know what (the study) determines as a 
cutoff point in something being drug-related.  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the statistics tripling proportionately is concerned, I believe 
that (the study) is accurate. . . . The war is not lost, but we are still in 
the middle of it. The whole question, though, is oversimplified. The proper 
question should be: 'What do we have to spend, in terms of money, manpower and 
sheer willingness on the part of average citizens to win this war?' Because we 
cannot afford to lose it. I cannot even entertain the notion that we're losing 
the war. That would lead to the degradation of our society. I just hope that 
the average decent citizen has the moral fiber to not turn away from this 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Postrel, editor of Reason Magazine 
</P>
<P>
 "The war on drugs has lost its meaning compared to where we were in the early 
'80s. People are put in prisons for nonviolent offenses, while the public 
worries more about violent crimes. We realize that filling the prisons with 
drug offenders is no longer such a major priority. We ought to worry more about 
protecting those people from themselves and protecting the public from violent 
acts.  
</P>
<P>
 "We must distinguish between substance-related crimes and crimes that stem 
from the prohibition on drugs. The prohibition makes drugs relatively expensive 
and difficult to obtain. Consequently, there are those who commit petty crimes 
to feed a drug habit and those who commit violent crimes because they deal in 
the black market. When you go without a legal market for most drugs, you 
(operate) without the legalities incorporated by the established industries. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "A small percentage of violent crimes occurring can be considered to be 
substance-related (versus prohibition-related). Currently, in order to get at 
the tiny percentage of people who are violent as a result of drug use, you put 
away thousands who may have gone their whole lives without committing a violent 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zeuner, Los Angeles Police Department narcotics detective 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem we have is that no one is even waging a real battle against 
drugs. I have (fewer) people working for me now than I did three years ago. If 
it were a war, I would have more resources. Smoking cocaine has impacted the 
drug problem severely. It has put people who wouldn't have been dependent on 
drugs 10 years ago into that category. Once people started smoking cocaine, 
they couldn't assimilate its being considered a recreational drug with the fact 
that they needed to have it on a constant basis.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are crimes with drugs involved that are not reported as drug-related 
because of their violent nature. People are involved in homicides that occur 
within a drug atmosphere. The percentage could go as high as 50% easily if 
those crimes were included. (In relation to winning the war on drugs), we've 
made some progress over the last five to seven years. But it's like putting 
your finger in a (crumbling) dike, only to see the problem resurface somewhere 
else."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: VALLEY CONGRESSMEN PART WITH PRESIDENT ON HAITI 
INTERVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA and CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TO WAR OR NOT TO WAR: The usual partisan fissures within the San Fernando 
Valley congressional delegation have evaporated over U.S. military intervention 
in Haiti. The five members (three Democrats and two Republicans) agree that 
President Clinton should not get the U.S. militarily involved in the island 
nation until he has first secured congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, U.S. Reps. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), Howard (Buck) 
McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) have co-sponsored 
resolutions and written letters urging Clinton to seek prior congressional 
authorization. And Reps. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Carlos Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) share the same view. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Valley's delegation is decidedly cool about the wisdom of 
invading Haiti at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Howard opposes military intervention in Haiti," said Jean Smith, Berman's 
chief of staff. So do Beilenson, McKeon and Moorhead. Waxman's views could not 
be readily ascertained Thursday because he was observing the Yom Kippur 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a big mistake to go in there," Moorhead said in an interview. "I 
don't see our national interest involved. It's impossible for us to make a 
democracy out of every country in the world." Moorhead also predicted that an 
invasion would result in significant U.S. losses -- not only from gunfire but 
from disease. "There's a lot of AIDS over there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said he is strongly opposed to sending ground troops into Haiti before 
other initiatives for purging its rulers have been tried. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he suggested that Clinton consider Ross Perot's plan for an 
aerial bombing of selective sites in Haiti. That could include the homes and 
headquarters of the military junta, McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see film of the generals comfortably sipping their drinks in their homes," 
McKeon said. "Let's make them uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton should also consider offering the Haitian rulers large chunks of U.S. 
taxpayer dollars to leave their country and go into exile, McKeon said. "Let's 
buy off the generals," he said. "I know it sounds distasteful, but it could be 
a lot cheaper than spending a lot of money on an invasion and losing American 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PUTTING MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS: With polls showing heavy, across-the-board 
support for Proposition 187 -- the November ballot initiative denying selected 
services to illegal immigrants -- its backers may have reason to be smug. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is seven weeks away, so it's still early in the game. But at the 
very least, the people who put up money to get Proposition 187 on the ballot 
have proven themselves adept at putting their fingers to the wind. A Times poll 
this week found 62% of surveyed voters favoring the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the initiative's early financial backers is longtime state Sen. Don 
Rogers (R-Tehachapi), whose 17th Senate District stretches from Kern County 
into the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, a staunch conservative whose views tilt to the right and stay there 
like a political Leaning Tower of Pisa, kicked in $25,000 to help get the 
so-called Save Our State initiative qualified for the ballot. The measure would 
bar illegal immigrants from public schools, non-emergency medical care and 
social services. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to the secretary of state's office, the loan from Rogers' 
campaign committee was the third-biggest contribution bankrolling the petition 
drive. It ranked right after the California Republican Party's $86,678 and 
$27,250 from the campaign committee of Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia). 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, it may be recalled, was recently in the news when the Legislature's 
Latino and black caucuses criticized him for appearing before a group of 
suspected white supremacists in Bakersfield. The senator spoke only of states' 
rights and denies sharing any racist views. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else may be said about Rogers, it's clear he's pretty good at summing 
up public sentiment in his district. His Grand Old Party is embracing SOS for 
the long haul, and 49% of registered voters in the sprawling 17th District are 
Republicans. Democrats trail with 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCOOPING UP VOTES?: Want to see your bill become law, even after it was 
already snuffed out once by a stroke of the governor's pen? 
</P>
<P>
 Reintroduce it and get it passed by the Legislature in an election year. That 
way it will land on the governor's desk at the same time as his campaign 
calendar update. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps proving that timing is everything, Gov. Pete Wilson this week signed 
into law a bill similar to one he vetoed two years ago, allowing the state to 
lease two cutting-edge "super-scooper" firefighting planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) gives the 
go-ahead for the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to trial-lease 
amphibious aircraft that can scoop up 1,600 gallons of water from an ocean or 
reservoir to dump on fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's turnabout follows a drubbing he took last year when victims of the 
Topanga Canyon and Malibu wildfires lit up talk-radio phone lines to question 
the governor's veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson nixed the bill in 1992 because it was too costly and he believed it 
could interfere with a restructuring that was under way in the Department of 
Forestry. But from the vantage point of angry property owners, the bill looked 
like just the thing that may have saved their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NO HORSING AROUND: Wilson dealt Assemblyman Richard Katz a major setback this 
week when he vetoed Katz's controversial bill to set up a domestic-partners 
registry to benefit gays and seniors alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sylmar Democrat chalked up a lower-profile victory when Wilson signed 
legislation to prevent stolen horses from ending up on someone's dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
 This bill was perhaps of more personal significance to Katz, who became a 
horseman nine years ago as a condition of marriage to Gini Barrett, who in 
exchange agreed to learn the ins and outs of politics. (Barrett, a quick study, 
has held up her end of the bargain better, Katz says.) 
</P>
<P>
 The new law stems from the growing number of equine thefts in California due 
to increased demand for horse meat overseas. It requires law enforcement 
agencies to report stolen or lost horses to the Bureau of Livestock 
Identification, which in turn surveys slaughter herds for the animals before 
they can be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Political cynics note that the new law could directly benefit some four-legged 
members of the Katz household: Cheyenne, a paint; Azteca, an appaloosa; 
Sundance, a palomino, and Peace, an appaloosa mix. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA COWBOY: Katz may be enough of an equestrian to ride in cattle-penning 
contests down at the state fairgrounds, but he's better known in public-policy 
circles for his role in transportation planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, as chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, Katz was tapped to 
serve on a new panel studying international trucking resulting from the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz is the only California state legislator to serve as an appointee of the 
National Conference of State Legislatures to the subcommittee examining truck 
size and weight policies. 
</P>

 MONEY TALES: Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and his staff argued 
last week that he never meant to gain financially by quietly accepting a 5% pay 
hike last month, noting that he only wanted the extra money so he could give it 
to four nonprofit programs in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet city officials have confirmed that Yaroslavsky could have made the same 
gift by simply transferring $1,200 from his $642,000 office budget to the four 
programs. "There's no bar at all to doing this," said Steve Wong, a top aide in 
the chief legislative analyst office. 
</P>
<P>
 But handling the transaction this way would have meant that Yaroslavsky would 
not have been eligible for a pension boost, and that the lawmaker could not 
have claimed the possible tax advantages of donating to nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit, Yaroslavsky had to be looking for a personal gain, said one city 
official. The only other explanation was that the chairman of the council's 
Budget Committee and a two-decade veteran of City Hall didn't know how to 
finesse his own office budget. Hmmm. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Some within the City Council family have also privately pointed out another 
tried-and-true method council members have used to fund nonprofit groups: 
giving them money from campaign contribution accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June 30, Yaroslavsky had $177,994.61 in his account.

CLINTON TELLS AMERICANS 'WE MUST ACT' NOW TO HELP HAITI; SPEECH: PRESIDENT 
INSISTS HE HAS EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER OPTIONS FOR RESTORING CARIBBEAN NATION'S 
DEPOSED LEADER. HE WARNS REGIME: 'YOUR TIME IS UP. LEAVE NOW OR WE WILL FORCE 
YOU FROM POWER.'

<P>
 With military preparations pointing to an imminent U.S. invasion of Haiti, 
President Clinton delivered a blunt message to the Caribbean nation's military 
leaders Thursday night: "Your time is up. Leave now or we will force you from 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have exhausted diplomacy," the President said. "Now the United States must 
protect its interests: to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of 
thousands of Haitians, to secure our borders and preserve stability in our 
hemisphere and to promote democracy and uphold the reliability of our 
commitment around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, tacitly harking back to his own days as an anti-Vietnam War activist, 
insisted that he was moving toward the use of military force only after 
exhausting all other avenues for restoring Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the only 
freely elected president in Haiti's history, to the office he lost in a Sept. 
30, 1991, coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the United States cannot and should not be the world's 
policeman," Clinton said. "But we have a responsibility to respond when 
inhumanity offends our values. And we have a particular interest in stopping 
brutality when it occurs so close to our shores." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's nationally televised speech from the White House marked his first 
full-scale effort to lay out the case for U.S. intervention. He sought both to 
frighten Haiti's defiant dictators into giving up without a fight and -- 
failing that -- to persuade a skeptical American public that restoring 
democracy to the impoverished island nation is worth its cost in blood and 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 H faced an uphill task with both audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, interviewed by CBS-TV immediately 
after Clinton's address, declared, "I will fight with my people and I am 
prepared to die." 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier interview with the network, he had said that a U.S. invasion 
would lead to civil war and a "massacre." He predicted "loss of life on both 
sides and also civilian casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, meanwhile, public opinion polls and scattered 
anti-invasion demonstrations continued to underline just how far Clinton has to 
go to make his case on the home front. An ABC News poll released Monday found 
that 73% of Americans oppose a U.S. invasion of Haiti, and 60% say that the 
country's vital interests are not at stake. Other polls have produced similar 
results. And on Capitol Hill, anti-invasion sentiment was growing in both the 
Senate and House. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before Clinton's speech, Defense Secretary William J. Perry announced 
that about 1,600 military reservists will be called up for possible service in 
Haiti, a step that is almost unavoidable under the Pentagon's present system of 
organizing its forces but one that surely will make the operation even more 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve call-ups disrupt the lives of the individuals involved and can affect 
their families, employers and communities. Under the Pentagon's present 
manpower system, however, many support functions for active-duty combat forces 
-- including medical treatment, transportation and military policing -- have 
been assigned to reserve units. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the invasion will not be necessary," Perry said, echoing the 
President's argument. "I hope that simply the preparation for this invasion 
will focus the thinking of the military regime there on what the clear 
alternatives are." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "As each day goes by and our preparations increase and our ships 
start moving toward Haiti, I think it becomes harder and harder for them to 
doubt our resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 From Clinton's standpoint, the only avenue to a clear victory is for Cedras 
and his two chief aides, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph 
Francois, to step down in the face of overwhelming American power. Such an 
outcome could restore Aristide to power without jeopardizing American lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said the President is considering the 
dispatch of an emissary, possibly Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), to make a 
final appeal to Cedras to step down. Richardson visited Port-au-Prince earlier 
this year and Cedras has invited him to return. 
</P>
<P>
 In building his case for U.S. military action, Clinton relied heavily on 
charges of gross human rights violations by Cedras and his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign of terror," Clinton said. 
"Executing children. Raping women. Killing priests. As the dictators have grown 
more desperate, the atrocities have grown ever more brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the President said that restoration of Aristide -- a winner with 
two-thirds of the vote in the only internationally recognized free and fair 
election ever to take place in Haiti -- is the only way to prevent a flood of 
Haitian refugees from trying to reach the United States or other countries in 
the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as Cedras rules, Haitians will continue to seek sanctuary in our 
nation," Clinton said. "Three hundred thousand more Haitians -- 5% of their 
entire population -- are in hiding. If we do not act, they will be the next 
wave of refugees at our door." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Haitian dictators stand fast and Clinton orders the invasion, a quick 
military victory seems assured because Haiti's ragtag army of about 7,000 men 
would be hopelessly overmatched against the allied force of at least 20,000 
well-armed troops. But if there are substantial American casualties or 
embarrassing accidents caused by the fog of war, the operation could seem to be 
a defeat for the Administration, even if all military objectives are ultimately 
met. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pentagon, Perry conceded that some American losses are all but 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to take at all lightly the possibilities of casualties in a 
forced entry," the defense secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it did not take long for the operation to produce an embarrassing mishap. 
A Navy patrol boat, the Monsoon, went aground on what the Navy said was an 
uncharted sandbar about two miles off the coast of Haiti; its crew was working 
Thursday night to free the vessel with the rising tide. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton spoke, military preparations for an invasion continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The force, including Special Forces and members of the Army's airborne corps 
from Ft. Bragg, N.C., is slated to carry out an initial strike against the 
island nation. In addition, 1,800 Marines and 2,000 light infantry Army 
soldiers are in place to handle post-attack duties such as peacekeeping efforts 
as the Aristide government is returned to Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Mount Whitney, which will be the command and control ship for 
an invasion, left Norfolk, Va., on its way to Haitian waters. Sources said it 
could take up to 72 hours to arrive in the region but that military commanders 
can direct operations even if the ship is still en route. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Boxx, a Defense Department spokesman, said that a fleet of more than 20 
ships will be in place in the region to facilitate an invasion. They will 
include two aircraft carriers, a destroyer, several frigates and 14 cargo ships 
carrying heavy equipment to breach the Haitian seaport. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision to activate 1,600 reservists was dictated by shrinking 
military budgets following the Vietnam War that caused the Pentagon to shift to 
the reserves many noncombat military units such as lawyers, engineers and 
administrators who are trained to assist in re-establishment of civilian 
government after combat. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the use of reserves generates so much resistance, the Lyndon B. 
Johnson and Richard Nixon administrations shunned their use in Vietnam to avoid 
further inflaming opposition to that conflict. But reservists were used in the 
Persian Gulf War against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "The call-up does not include general-purpose combat troops," Perry said. "It 
includes reservists in specialties of tactical airlift, port operations, 
military police, medical support and civil affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the initial activation is only for three months, it seems certain 
that some reservists will be needed for far longer than that.

 LATE-SUMMER CLEANING: If you like pristine beaches, Saturday is your day. 
Nearly 4,000 volunteers hit Orange County beaches last year in the state's 
annual beach cleanup, collecting nearly 50,000 tons of debris. Most of it was 
plastic -- like those plastic rings that go around a six-pack. . . . Want to 
help? Show up at any beach at 9 a.m. and plan to stay for three hours. (B3) 
</P>
<P>
 PRETTY PRISONS? Ever find yourself groaning when your neighbors want to drag 
out their color slides? Irvine City Council members this week were treated to 
slides of staff members' trips to Texas and Florida -- to visit federal 
prisons. This is all in case U.S. officials follow up on suggestions for a 
federal prison at El Toro Marine base. Though not ready to embrace the concept 
quite yet, Councilwoman Paula Werner remarked: "It looked more like a community 
college campus."

 CHEM ACE: Scientific awards are old hat for UC Irvine physical chemistry 
Professor A.J. Shaka. But Shaka headed to the U.S. Open in New York last week 
to for a prize of a different sort. Shaka, 36, was awarded the Rolex 
Achievement Award, given to ex-varsity college tennis players who later excel 
in their careers. Shaka won the NCAA Division III singles title while at Harvey 
Mudd College. . . . "I found out I had a knack for teaching when I taught 
tennis in the summers," says Shaka. In tennis, as in chemistry, "you've got to 
do things over and over again if you want to get good at it."

 ANGEL LORE: Used to be Orange County's biker clubs were the biggest gang 
threat. But when outlaw Hells Angels tried to establish a foothold in the 
1970s, two Orange County Sheriff's Department investigators and an informant 
put the kibosh on it, according to a new book entitled "Chain of Evidence" 
(E1). . . . "By infiltrating them with a woman -- a female cop -- it 
demoralized them," said Sheriff's Department Lt. Steve Carroll. "They really 
were very, very dangerous people." Beautiful Beaches

 LOST SEAT: As Thousand Oaks opened its new City Hall this week, officials 
rededicated 16 seats in the City Council chamber to outstanding citizens. But 
former Councilwoman Madge Schaefer lost her seat of honor. (B4) . . . "I take 
it as a snub," she said. "I don't consider it an oversight when it comes from 
the city manager's office." . . . City Manager Grant Brimhall said the error 
was not his. "But there's a major apology due her," he said, offering to 
rededicate Schaefer's seat in a second ceremony.

 RUN-AND-SHOOT: With a new coach and wide-open offense, ex-Santa Clara High 
quarterback Tim Gutierrez seems poised to duplicate his 1989 Oxnard heroics at 
San Diego State (C8). . . . New coach Ted Tollner says he first mistook the 
quarterback's quiet demeanor for lack of fire. But Gutierrez has now gained his 
respect. "The closer it gets to the game, his composure becomes more and more 
of a strength." . . . Last week Gutierrez gunned down Cal, passing for 314 
yards and two touchdowns in the come-from-behind victory.

 HORNED BORER: A majestic stand of 97 Simi Valley eucalyptus trees will be cut 
soon, victims of the long-horned borer, a beetle that followed them from 
Australia (B4). . . . "I'm sad the trees are going to be cut down, but I'm 
elated they're going to be cut down because we have teen-agers doing drugs from 
there," says Pat Tripdo of neighboring Eucalyptus Street. . . . In place of the 
trees, a 93-house subdivision will be planted. 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING ENGLISH: To bridge the linguistic gulf that separated them from 
employees, officials at Gold Coast Recycling offered Latino employees free 
English classes after work. . . . About 75 of 100 employees are native Spanish 
speakers. Twenty-seven warehouse workers graduated Thursday from a three-month 
English language class taught by a Ventura College instructor. . . . "Lately, 
they've all been speaking English," said Marcy Sanchez, spokeswoman for the 
Ventura company.

PUC OPENS TOLL CALL MARKET, OKS RATE HIKES; PHONE SERVICE: BASIC FEES WILL RISE 
BUT LOCAL LONG- DISTANCE CHARGES WILL FALL. DECISION DRAWS WIDE CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a long-awaited ruling that will dramatically alter telephone pricing in 
California, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday opened so-called 
local long-distance to competition beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the policy change, the commission approved a substantial increase 
in basic local service charges -- some GTE customers' rates will climb as much 
as 80%. But prices for local long-distance, or toll calls -- defined as calls 
between points more than 12 miles apart but within local calling regions -- 
will plummet as long-distance companies such as AT & T and MCI enter a market 
reserved for Pacific Bell and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial decision -- which caps seven years of tempestuous hearings 
and deliberations -- is the first step in the arduous process of deregulating 
telecommunications in California, which lags far behind most of the nation in 
promoting phone service competition. The commission actually delivered a final 
ruling on toll calling a year ago, but was forced to rescind it after it was 
learned that a Pacific Bell employee helped write it. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Thursday's ruling drew criticism from most of those involved in 
the telephone regulation process: Consumer groups decried the local service 
rate increases, long-distance carriers complained about cumbersome access codes 
that customers will have to dial to use a carrier other than the local phone 
company, and Pacific Bell and GTE -- though generally pleased with the ruling 
-- grumbled about not getting the changes they sought. Pacific Bell had wanted 
to cut toll rates further while GTE was concerned that increases in basic rates 
were insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the utilities commission, more than half of California's 
residential customers will end up paying more for phone service under its new 
rate structure, with GTE customers having bigger increases than Pacific Bell 
customers. The median phone bill will rise 2% for Pacific Bell customers and 
16% for GTE customers, and consumers will face a confusing array of new choices 
for local long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Large businesses, and anyone who makes a lot of local long-distance calls, can 
look forward to substantially lower bills. Calls between Los Angeles and 
Riverside, for example, or between Anaheim and Santa Monica, are toll calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in basic service is designed to offset revenue Pacific Bell and 
GTE are expected to lose when they surrender their monopolies in the $3-billion 
local long-distance market. The monthly flat rate for Pacific Bell residential 
customers will increase 35% to $11.25 from $8.35. For GTE customers, the 
monthly flat rate will leap 54% to $17.25 from $11.20. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consumer is getting the shaft here," said Audrie Krause, executive 
director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a San Francisco-based advocacy 
group. The hardest-hit group will be the estimated 20% to 30% of phone 
customers who don't make toll calls monthly, mostly elderly people or working 
poor who don't qualify for discounted lifeline rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that make many toll calls will be the big winners. Rates for 
daytime toll calls, made mostly by businesses, will fall an average of 44% 
under the commission's ruling -- and they could fall even more depending on how 
aggressively the nearly 100 long-distance carriers compete for a piece of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But small businesses that make few local long-distance calls will end up 
paying substantially more under the new plan. GTE's monthly basic business rate 
is going up 83% to $19.22. Pacific Bell's monthly basic business rate is rising 
24% to $10.32. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-distance industry is furious that the new policy does not require 
Pacific Bell and GTE to provide so-called one-plus dialing for toll calls. 
Although a customer who uses, for example, MCI for regular long-distance 
service only needs to dial a 1, the area code and number, the same customer 
using MCI for local long distance will have to dial a five-digit access code 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI denounced this requirement as a "Rube Goldberg-like process" and a 
"Pacific Bell ruse" that would thwart the development of true competition. The 
commission, noting that it is not technically possible to implement one-plus 
dialing by Jan. 1, sided with Pacific Bell and GTE, who argued that such a 
requirement would be unduly expensive to implement and thus would force more 
local rate increases.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell President David Dorman contended that even with new basic rate 
increases, customers will still be paying less than the true cost of providing 
the service. But he praised the commission's ruling, saying it gave Pacific 
Bell the ability to compete with long-distance companies -- which he said had 
already siphoned off $500 million in toll call business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although long-distance companies can't compete directly for the toll business 
now, some corporations have installed technology that allows them to bypass the 
local phone company and link directly with a lower rate long-distance company, 
Dorman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout of the decision is likely to include a round of confusion among 
people who for the first time must choose a toll carrier, which may be 
different from the local and long-distance carrier. The commission anticipates 
that at least 93 companies -- ranging from long-distance giants to boutique 
companies that serve mostly business -- will be vying for the business. 
</P>

 Phone customers who do not select Pacific Bell or GTE for their toll calls 
will have to dial a five-digit access code to reach the carrier -- putting the

install the technology making equal access calling possible.

BLACK CAUCUS SPLIT ON INVASION; MANY EXPRESS RESERVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exercising its legislative clout, the Congressional Black Caucus succeeded 
last spring in persuading President Clinton to focus more aggressively on 
restoring democracy to Haiti. Since then, however, Clinton has been less 
successful in persuading the caucus that Haitian democracy is worth the loss of 
American life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one measure of the lack of congressional support for a U.S. invasion of 
Haiti that even the 38 members of the Black Caucus, who earlier criticized 
Clinton for not acting forcefully enough to oust the Haitian military junta, 
are now almost evenly divided over the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional anti-war sentiment of many of its members, strong opposition 
by many of their constituents and the fear -- shared by most members of 
Congress -- that restoring democracy to Haiti will entail a long and costly 
commitment by U.S. forces instead have convinced many caucus members that the 
President has "embraced our cause somewhat too enthusiastically," according to 
one member who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caucus is united on restoring democracy to Haiti but is divided over how 
to do it," said Dan Wilson, a spokesman for Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), the 
group's chairman, who says that an invasion at this time is premature. "A few 
members are still undecided, but right now it's close to being an even split." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents include Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland), chairman of the House 
Armed Services Committee and one of the caucus's most liberal members, and Rep. 
Gary Franks of Connecticut, its only Republican and most conservative member. 
</P>
<P>
 Members acknowledge that, after criticizing Clinton for ignoring Haiti, their 
failure to support him now has exposed the caucus to criticism from the 
President's allies. But there has been much less of that than they feared, 
largely because Clinton's decision to invade has so little support on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like everyone else, I fear that it will be hard to get out of Haiti once we 
get in," said caucus member Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.). "My constituents are 
concerned about the violation of human rights there, but the great majority of 
people calling in from my district are also saying, 'Don't send our young men 
in there.' "

CASTRO TELLS MCGOVERN HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HAITI LEADERS STAY

 Fidel Castro cannot understand why Haitian military leaders have not fled in 
the face of an imminent U.S. invasion, George McGovern said Thursday after a 
long discussion with the Cuban leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Castro) said they're not noted for their courage and they have no principles 
and no ideals . . . and therefore he doesn't understand why they don't flee in 
the face of a probable American invasion," McGovern told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 McGovern, a former South Dakota senator and presidential candidate, said he 
talked with Castro for 2 1/2 hours in Havana late Monday and would brief White 
House officials on the conversation today. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said one explanation for the Haitian generals' "stubbornness" might be 
their refusal to accept the post-Cold War political climate, McGovern said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still operating under the aura of the Cold War alliance with the 
United States under which people's sins are forgiven as long as they're 
anti-communist," McGovern quoted Castro as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said the same attitude can be seen among Cuban migrants taken to U.S. 
camps at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba who believe they will go directly to 
the United States, even though the Clinton Administration has ruled this out.

WILDER BOWS OUT OF VIRGINIA SENATE RACE; POLITICS: HE ACCEDES TO DEMOCRATS' 
WISHES. THEY HOPE THE END OF HIS INDEPENDENT CANDIDACY WILL BOOST SEN. ROBB'S 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST OLIVER NORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder withdrew from the U.S. Senate race in 
Virginia on Thursday, apparently bowing to the wishes of Democratic leaders 
convinced that his campaign could boost Republican Oliver L. North's chances to 
take the seat from incumbent Democrat Charles S. Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic powerbrokers, including Vice President Al Gore, and personal 
friends of the state's first black governor had passionately urged Wilder to 
give up his bid for the sake of the party, which is struggling to retain 
control of the Senate. The former Democratic governor had waged an independent 
campaign for the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen that the two-party system in Virginia is strong and that the 
difficulty in financing independent candidacies is real," Wilder said in a 
statement. "I am a realist. I know when to hold them and when to fold them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether his withdrawal will be enough to boost Robb's lukewarm campaign is far 
from certain, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday North was a narrow favorite; today Robb is a narrow favorite," said 
Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of Virginia. "I think 
Robb is a shaky favorite. He's seen as having a relatively weak record and 
being closely tied to Clinton, who is enormously unpopular in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb's admitted extramarital relationships do not help him either, Sabato 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb seemed to be buoyed by the news of Wilder's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Wilder is a formidable candidate, a formidable campaigner and 
adversary," Robb said while touring an elementary school in Alexandria, the 
Associated Press reported, "and having him no longer on the other side gives me 
an opportunity to bring together all the pieces of the Democratic coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls, before Wilder dropped out, showed North and Robb neck and neck, 
each with support from about one-third of the electorate. But North so far has 
had the momentum. In early polls, his share was as low as 21% or 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our ball. The question is whether we move it up the field fast enough," 
said Glen Bolger, North's pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Republicans said that, since polls showed Wilder's support to be 
small and shrinking, his withdrawal will not have the impact Democrats hope it 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls conducted just before Wilder's withdrawal showed him with only 12% or 
13% support. Republican J. Marshall Coleman, who is also running as an 
independent, had a slightly smaller share. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Johnson, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, said 
that Wilder and Coleman "were fastly becoming irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 While far from confident, North's supporters have one clear advantage over 
Robb's backers, analysts said. Both candidates are opposed by large portions of 
the population but North, at least, has a core group of very energetic 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much enthusiasm, period, for Robb," Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Robb's favor, the negative sentiment against him is not as strong as it 
is against North. A recent poll showed that 41% of undecided voters consider 
North an unacceptable choice, while 28% see Robb that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many voters, their evaluation of Oliver North starts and ends with 
Iran-Contra," said John McGlennon, a professor of political science at the 
College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. "Almost half of the voters say 
under no circumstance would they vote for North." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb will be likely to pick up the support of black Virginians, who make up 
about 18% of the electorate and are attracted to Robb because of his record as 
governor and that of his father-in-law, former President Lyndon B. Johnson.

DISTRAUGHT DEPUTY KILLS WIFE, THEN HIMSELF

<P>
 A sheriff's deputy, distraught over the impending breakup of his marriage, 
shot and killed his wife Thursday in the courthouse then killed himself in a 
standoff with police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Tommy Cicardo said Paul Broussard, 39, killed his 26-year-old wife, 
Andrea, in a stairwell of the Rapides Parish Courthouse where she worked in the 
clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran from the scene on foot and we caught up with him about a block away in 
front of a local bank," Cicardo said. "After several hours of negotiation, with 
him holding a gun to his head or to his chest, he shot himself in the head 
shortly before noon." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had a 2-year-old child and he had a 10-year-old child by a previous 
marriage, Cicardo said.

COLLEGE AGREES TO SETTLE COMPUTER HARASSMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A junior college has agreed to pay two female students $15,000 each because of 
derogatory sexual remarks made about them on a men-only computer bulletin 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Santa Rosa Junior College admitted no wrongdoing, student Lois Arata 
said the settlement announced Wednesday supports her contention that the school 
did not do enough to prevent sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started when Arata complained about the school newspaper running 
an advertisement that showed a woman's bare buttocks. She called for a boycott 
of the paper in March. 
</P>
<P>
 A former newspaper staffer informed Arata that some men on the newspaper had 
written sexual insults about her and her friend, Jennifer Branham, on the 
paper's men-only computer message network. 
</P>
<P>
 The women and the staffer who told them, Dylan Humphrey, sued the school and 
complained to the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit's allegations include the charge that the school allowed 
retaliation against the two women and Humphrey, who also will receive $15,000 
from the settlement.

LOSS OF WETLANDS THREATENS STATE'S SHRIMP, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government declared four species of California shrimp threatened 
or endangered by the federal government Thursday because of loss of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the threatened wetlands habitat is in the Central Valley, although the 
shrimp exist in at least 13 counties, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An exhaustive review of all the available data makes it clear that listing is 
warranted," Fish and Wildlife Service Director Mollie Beattie said in a news 
release. The agency will soon outline proposals to preserve wetlands, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The threatened or endangered shrimp are known to exist in Butte, Contra Costa, 
Glenn, Merced, Riverside, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Shasta, 
Solano, Tehama, Tulare and Ventura counties, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated as endangered were the conservancy fairy shrimp, the longhorn fairy 
shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Listed as threatened was the vernal 
pool fairy shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie said only a fraction of the proposed development projects in the 
region would be hurt by the listing. Some projects may have to be modified to 
protect wetlands, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy) called the listing outrageous and unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
 "In its zeal to make California farmers into vassals of the federal 
government, the Fish and Wildlife Service has cast aside studies which 
demonstrate that the fairy shrimp may not be endangered," Pombo said, adding 
that motorists who drive through puddles may end up subject to fines for 
damaging shrimp habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Krauter, spokesman for the California Farm Bureau, said that despite the 
government's assurances, farmers were still wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Potentially, there could be very serious problems for landowners," Krauter 
said. "Landowners have been stripped of their rights to use their land." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government is committed to protecting habitat and the region's 
economy, Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp are a food source for waterfowl and 
amphibians in the Central Valley. Because they are dependent on water 
availability, salinity and other factors, they are an indicator of the general 
conditions of seasonal wetlands, the agency said.

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; QUARTERBACKS AREN'T LIVING UP TO 
THEIR EARLY EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two weeks of the 1994 football season, some are beginning to wonder what 
has happened to all those great Pacific 10 Conference quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the preseason hype focused on outstanding quarterbacks who were 
expected to lead their teams to big years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several teams have played only once, only three of the 10 conference 
teams have unblemished records. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three with 2-0 marks, only UCLA, with Wayne Cook, has one of the highly 
rated quarterbacks. And Cook has hardly been dominant in the Bruins' victories, 
having thrown only two touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The passer who probably has come closest to living up to the ballyhoo is 
Stanford's Steve Stenstrom. Despite Stenstrom's sensational performance at 
Northwestern, the Cardinal had to settle for a 41-41 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom overcame two of his fumbles, completing 25 of 38 passes for 374 
yards and a touchdown. He also drove Stanford into position for the short field 
goal attempt that failed at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Stanford Coach Bill Walsh said, "Steve Stenstrom is the 
best college passer in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's lack of a running attack has put added pressure on Stenstrom, but 
sophomore Mike Mitchell ran for 136 yards against Northwestern, 10 more than he 
gained all last season. He also was credited with a touchdown, although he 
dropped the ball a stride before he reached the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, there were some major disappointments at quarterback last week. 
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks maintains that if Danny O'Neil played in one of the 
population centers, instead of in Eugene, he would be regarded as one of the 
real stars. Pardon the Hawaii Rainbows if they aren't buying that. 
</P>
<P>
 After passing for four touchdowns in a rout of Portland State, O'Neil was 
supposed to lead the Ducks to their second victory Saturday night at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 But with O'Neil suffering from flu and hardly able to practice all week, the 
Ducks were trounced, 36-16. The Rainbows intercepted three of O'Neil's passes, 
Junior Faavae returning one 44 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil will get a chance Saturday to rebound when he returns home to play 
Utah. He will have to do it without wide receiver Kory Murphy, who is out for 
the season with a spinal injury. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dave Barr was sound last season, the California Bears were unbeatable. It 
was when he was out or hampered by injury that the Bears lost their four games. 
Barr regained his best form to lead Cal to a 37-3 rout of Iowa in the Alamo 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr was in good shape Saturday at San Diego State, but Cal lost, 22-20, on a 
field goal as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr, who completed 68% of his passes last season, completed 21 of 34 for 242 
yards, with one touchdown and a costly interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this game the Aztecs had lost 17 in a row to Pac-10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason pick for the best quarterback was USC's Rob Johnson. Many expected 
him to go in the first round of next year's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his first two games, Johnson has played poorly. He has been a tentative 
passer, waiting too long and getting sacked too often. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Trojans rallied to defeat Washington, it was the running game, not 
Johnson's passing, that brought them from behind. When Penn State overwhelmed 
USC early, Johnson could do nothing to help his team get back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington made a smart move last spring when it made an all-out effort to get 
running star Napoleon Kaufman to return for his final collegiate season. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision seems to have benefited the Huskies as well as Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams ineligible for postseason play often have little incentive. The Huskies, 
on probation for misuses in their summer jobs program among other NCAA 
violations, found a way to give their team a reason to play by building Kaufman 
into a Heisman Trophy contender. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Kaufman stands to make a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake about it, this is Kaufman's team. Under ordinary 
circumstances, as soon as the Huskies clinched Saturday's victory over Ohio 
State, Kaufman would have left the game for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, coaches kept him in until he gained a personal-high 211 yards. The 
Huskies figure the first four games against four of the nation's best teams 
will give Kaufman the exposure he needs. The performance against an Ohio State 
team known for its defense was a great start. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman was somewhat battered and bruised after rushing 58 times in the first 
two games. But he gets this week off and should be ready for the next two big 
ones -- at Miami and at home against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two other unbeaten teams, Arizona and Washington State, don't have 
quarterbacks considered among the elite, although the Cougars are expecting big 
things from redshirt sophomore Chad Davis, who set state passing marks at three 
Southern California high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona and Washington State rank 1-2 in the conference in total defense with 
the Wildcats the leaders at 222 yards per game. The Cougars have given up only 
39 yards rushing in two games, best in the nation.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; ZITO STILL HAS HIGH ASPIRATIONS

<P>
 Nick Zito is ready to concede Horse of the Year to Holy Bull, if he wins the 
$500,000 Woodward on Super Saturday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 If he doesn't? 
</P>
<P>
 "If Go for Gin wins, why isn't that a big deal?" the trainer asked. "If Bull 
wins, I concede, but that hasn't happened yet. And the year's not over yet, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight horses, all Grade I stakes winners, were entered on Thursday for the 1 
1/8-mile Woodward, one of six Grade I stakes on the card Saturday at Belmont 
with prize money totaling more than $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zito-trained Go for Gin, winner of the Kentucky Derby, was made the early 
9-2 second choice to Travers winner Holy Bull at 8-5. Holy Bull, trained by 
Jimmy Croll, will ship to Belmont Saturday morning from his home at Monmouth 
Park in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Bull is a wonderful horse," Zito said. "But I think championships should 
be won in championship races. You remember the year the Raiders were 9-7, but 
when they got to the playoffs, they won all the big races. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only race Holy Bull has won like that was the Travers." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull finished a badly beaten 12th in the Kentucky Derby, then skipped the 
Preakness and Belmont Stakes, in which Go for Gin finished second to Tabasco 
Cat both times. Since the Derby, Holy Bull has won the Metropolitan Handicap, 
Dwyer, Haskell and Travers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very confident with him," Holy Bull's rider, Mike Smith, said. "I know 
that if he runs his race, he'll be a tough horse to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Croll has said the Woodward will be Holy Bull's last race of the year, while 
most of the rest of the Eclipse Award contenders will go on to the Breeders' 
Cup in November at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Woodward field will be defending champion Bertrando, 1993 Belmont 
Stakes winner Colonial Affair, Suburban winner Devil His Due, Pistols and 
Roses, Tinners Way and Brunswick. The 3-year-olds, Go for Gin and Holy Bull, 
will carry 121 pounds. The rest will carry 126. 
</P>
<P>
 The other races on the big card will be the $111,800 Futurity for 2-year-old 
colts, the $107,900 Matron for 2-year-old fillies, the seven-furlong Vosburgh 
at $200,000, the $200,000 Ruffian for fillies and mares, and the 1 3/8-mile Man 
o'War on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ruffian Handicap, although drawing a smaller field, is nearly the equal of 
the Woodward in competitiveness. The favorite will be Sky Beauty, who was 
assigned the huge impost of 130 pounds, 17 more than the highly regarded 
Dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's getting up there now where it's really tough," said Sky Beauty's 
trainer, H. Allen Jerkens, who also trains Devil His Due. "If she can carry 
that much weight and win on Saturday, she's really special." 
</P>
<P>
 Sky Beauty, a 4-year-old filly, has run 10 of her 16 career races at Belmont 
Park and won all 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine 2-year-olds were entered in the Futurity, including Hopeful winner Wild 
Escapade, and the Matron drew a field of six juvenile fillies, including D. 
Wayne Lukas' highly regarded and unbeaten Flanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerkens also has a horse in the field of 11 entered for the Vosburgh, Virginia 
Rapids, and the Man o'War drew a field of nine, including 1992 Breeders' Cup 
Turf winner Fraise, Fourstars Allstar and Solar Splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great day of racing, there's no doubt about that," Jerkens said.

 Hal McRae, one of five black managers in the major leagues, was fired by the 
Kansas City Royals on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 McRae, 49, was one of the most popular players in team history but did not 
achieve the same success as a manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Hal has done everything possible with the club he had," said Royal 
General Manager Herk Robinson. "He's done a good job. But as we move forward we 
feel we can find a manager who can better lead us into the next several years 
with the younger players." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over from the fired John Wathan in May 1991 with no previous 
experience, McRae compiled a 286-277 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank (the Royals) for giving me the opportunity to manage," McRae 
said from his home in Bradenton, Fla. "I'm a better person because I've 
managed. I believe I improved as a manager."

 Detroit Lion Coach Wayne Fontes is exceedingly high on quarterback Scott 
Mitchell, saying: "One day this quarterback will take the franchise to the big 
dance. He's that type of player, and that's something you have to have to go to 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be this year, it could be next year. In his career, here with the 
Detroit Lions, he'll take this team to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Will he take Fontes along with him?

 Trivia time: Who holds the Pacific 10 Conference record for most consecutive 
pass completions in a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective: Hubert Mizell of the St. Petersburg Times on Florida's 73-7 rout 
of Kentucky last Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game:  
</P>
<P>
 "As conference historians know, Florida usually has trouble scoring 73 against 
Kentucky in basketball."

<P>
 Accolade: Indiana basketball Coach Bob Knight, on Michael Jordan: "There is 
absolutely no argument as to who was the best player who ever played the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure we've ever had an athlete in this country in any sport from whom 
so much was expected as Michael Jordan, or who delivered so often as Jordan 
did."

 "Aw, come on, Pete. Nobody buys the Brooklyn Bridge anymore."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: AT LEAST MICHAELS STILL HAS FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last World Series Al Michaels announced, in 1989, was interrupted by an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 And now this year's Series, which he was scheduled to work for ABC, has been 
canceled by a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't feel sorry for Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had never worked a World Series, it might be different," Michaels said. 
"But this would have been my eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business, I've learned you savor what you have done, not what you 
would have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what is going to happen. I would have been the host of the 
1996 Summer Olympics had ABC gotten them, and we just missed out. But that's 
the way it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have 'Monday Night Football,' which I love more than ever. I have 
something every week I look forward to very much." 
</P>
<P>
 A World Series after a prolonged work stoppage is something Michaels wouldn't 
have savored anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I wouldn't have wanted the baseball season to resume," he said. "Once the 
strike lasted more than a couple weeks, all was lost." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Michaels: As more than just a casual observer, Michaels believes baseball 
will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no settlement by next spring, I think the owners will simply open 
up the training camps and invite anyone who wants to show up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners' model will be the 1987 football strike, when the teams used 
replacement players. To get 700 players to toe the line and not cross the line 
would be asking a hell of a lot." 
</P>

 No accord on McCord: The organizers of the first U.S. Presidents Cup golf 
tournament don't seem to have any problem with Gary McCord working their event 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 McCord is the new bad boy of golf, if you are to believe the stuffed shirts 
who put on the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 At last April's Masters, McCord said the greens were so slick that they seemed 
to have been groomed "with bikini wax." He also said that a piece of bumpy 
ground looked "suspiciously like body bags." 
</P>
<P>
 McCord, who is from Riverside and now lives in Vail, Colo., has done and said 
a lot of off-beat things in his nine years as a golf commentator for CBS. When 
he goes a little too far, he says he usually hears about it in his ear in a 
"nanosecond" from producer Frank Chirkinian. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was none of that at this year's Masters. It was two or three days 
before Chirkinian called. He said the Masters people weren't happy, but no way 
would they knock him off the Masters if Chirkinian had anything to say about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 McCord said it went back and forth for about three weeks until he volunteered 
to bow out. Word leaked out last week that McCord had been booted from the 
Masters, much the same as Jack Whitaker had in 1966 after calling the Masters 
gallery a "mob." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the way the media works, and I was planning for four months how to 
handle this," McCord said from his hotel room in McLean, Va., near the site of 
the Presidents Cup. "I knew it would cause quite a stir." 
</P>
<P>
 That it has, with no one on the side of the Masters' pooh-bahs. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has also taken heat for not backing McCord more. 
</P>
<P>
 McCord, meanwhile, has been trying to douse the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud their decision," McCord wrote of Masters officials in a 
first-person story in this week's Golf World magazine. "In the contract with 
CBS, they have the right to evaluate the announcers and decide who personifies 
the muted rituals of restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a loud wail. They are doing what they think is in the best interest of 
the Masters, and I can't argue with the decisions they have made to make this a 
near-spiritual gathering." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add McCord: He has always strived to say things differently and avoid cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale Irwin, who along with Paul Azinger is the co-captain of the U.S. team for 
the Presidents Cup, said of McCord during a conference call this week: "(He) is 
not one of us. He is from another world, the planet Blothar." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McCord: "He remembers that? Gee, I barely remember it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was leading the Houston Open, I believe it was 1980, and I went into the 
media tent to try and explain how that could be. I said I wasn't really Gary 
McCord, I was By Product 17 from the planet Blothar, and I had entered Gary 
McCord's body for a day as an experiment to see what it feels like to lead a 
golf tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you spell Blothar?" McCord was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea. Let's go with, oh gee, B-L-O-T-H-A-R," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCord said the "body bag" reference was a takeoff on the cliche that a golfer 
"is dead" after a particularly bad shot. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the "bikini wax" comment, he said he was simply looking for another way 
to describe the greens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up with, 'These greens are so fast, I don't think they mow them, they 
A) use Nair on them, B) use electrolysis on them, C) pluck them, or D) bikini 
wax them.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we all know that I used D and I'm outta there. Probably any of the four 
would have gotten me tossed." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add golf: The Presidents Cup on ESPN today and CBS Saturday and Sunday is a 
Ryder Cup-type competition that has a U.S. team led by Fred Couples, Davis Love 
III and Corey Pavin facing an international team that includes golfers from 
countries outside Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Price of Zimbabwe leads the international team. Greg Norman had to drop 
out this week because of intestinal problems.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MCDANIEL STANDS OUT AMID DISAPPOINTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After giving up 550 yards and seven touchdowns in two games, the Raiders' pass 
defense ranks 22nd in the NFL and that does not sit well with Pro Bowl 
cornerback Terry McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been playing good at all," said McDaniel, whose 41-yard fumble 
return for a touchdown was overshadowed in the Raiders' 38-9 loss to Seattle on 
Sunday."We're giving up too many points and too many big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Raiders have had more than their share of problems stopping the 
pass, McDaniel has played well. 
</P>
<P>
 Against San Francisco, it was his deflection of a pass that turned into an 
interception by linebacker Greg Biekert, which led to the Raiders' first 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel also played well against the Seahawks with several deflections and an 
interception that was nullified because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler threw impressively in practice. "I have no question 
that his arm is fine," Coach Art Shell said. "I'm very confident in that. He's 
just been a little out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jerry Ball, who suffered a pulled hamstring against Seattle, 
did not practice for the second consecutive day but is listed as probable for 
Sunday's game at Denver. . . . Defensive tackle Willie Broughton, who suffered 
a dislocated right elbow in preseason drills, resumed limited practice this 
week. . . . Defensive lineman Scott Davis is still a no-show and Shell said he

 As expected, All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders ended his free-agent tour by 
rejecting several more lucrative offers in favor of a one-year, $1.1-million 
contract with the San Francisco 49ers. The deal includes $750,000 in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders took part in workouts with his new team and hopes to play Sunday 
against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 In another move, the 49ers signed former Pro Bowl defensive end Charles Mann, 
who was released by the Washington Redskins.

 After a half-day walkout before the season began, Sterling Sharpe was ensured 
of being the NFL's highest-paid receiver from the 1995 season through the year 
2000, the Green Bay Press-Gazette reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A new clause stipulates that Sharpe's pay will equal the average yearly salary 
of the league's highest-paid receiver, plus $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe's deal was also sweetened for this season in which he will earn $2.7 
million -- third highest for a wide receiver -- instead of the $1.3 million 
originally scheduled after the club triggered a $1.4-million escalator clause.

 The NCAA restored the eligibility of two of the five suspended Florida State 
football players, freeing All-American linebacker Derrick Brooks and reserve 
offensive lineman Marcus Long to play Saturday at Wake Forest. However, the 
NCAA extended the two-game suspension of senior tailback Tiger McMillon to 
three games. Florida State appealed the decision on McMillon and said a ruling 
was expected today. Patrick McNeil, a three-year starter at guard, had been 
suspended for three games but he will also sit out a fourth for an unspecified 
violation of team rules. Forrest Conoly had been suspended for four games. All 
were disciplined for taking gifts from a prospective agent last November.

 It was Monday, and J.J. Stokes felt it incumbent on him to call a team meeting 
and excuse UCLA's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose: talk about Nebraska, No. 1 in one poll, No. 2 in another and 
probably the toughest team the Bruins would play all season. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1? "It's hard to say who is No. 1, No. 2," Stokes told them. "They're not 
No. 1 with me. Don't go in there with the mindset that they are with you." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Stokes added a postscript: No. 1 or 2 or 106, it didn't matter. 
UCLA would have to play Nebraska without him. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll make the trip to Lincoln today, and Coach Terry Donahue talked about the 
occasional miracle happening, but Stokes made it clear.

 "I'll be a spectator," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hit on the thigh by a helmet on the season's second play, got in two 
more quarters and hasn't played since the Tennessee game. Each day he has held 
forth that he would be ready -- until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any mobility and I haven't run in two weeks," he said. "I wish I 
could be out there, but I can't. I can't move my leg, so it's obvious I can't 
play."

 Another Bruin who will make the trip and not play is Skip Hicks, who had a 
long touchdown run called back against the Cornhuskers last season. He has been 
sidelined because of a springtime knee injury, but Donahue said Hicks will 
dress for Saturday's game just to get him back into the flow of things.

 Freshman fullback Greg Ford is a walk-on no more. He has been given a 
scholarship. . . . The Bruins will fly to Omaha today and work out at Nebraska 
Omaha. JIM HODGES

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; RECEIVER HERVEY TO MISS NEXT GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's pass offense will have to make do without starting wide receiver Ed 
Hervey in the Sept. 24 Baylor game. Coach John Robinson said the knee Hervey 
injured against Washington two games ago will keep him out of a second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Hervey nor Keyshawn Johnson, the other starting wide receiver, played 
against Penn State last week. Johnson was also held out of Thursday's practice 
because of a stubborn thigh injury that has caused knee swelling. 
</P>
<P>
 And quarterback Rob Johnson sat out another practice. He's still nursing a 
sore lower back, picked up in the Washington game. He's expected to participate 
in drills next week, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 11 varsity sports seasons in high school and four years here in 
football, and these are the first practices I've ever missed with an injury," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>

 Quincy Harrison, a sophomore backup cornerback who returned an intercepted 
pass for a 68-yard touchdown at Penn State last weekend, has cracked the 
starting lineup. The Trojans were trailing Penn State, 35-0, early in the third 
quarter when Harrison, from Eldorado High in Las Vegas, intercepted a pass and 
returned it for a touchdown. EARL GUSTKEY

FAIRPLEX; FLORES MOVES UP TO NO. 2 ON LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Flores, a little man of few words, doesn't pretend to understand why he 
rides so well at Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. "I just get the best horses and they take me to the 
wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Those horses have been taking the 26-year-old native of Tijuana to the wire 
faster and more often than any other jockey during the last five years at the 
Los Angeles County Fair, and Thursday he became the second all-time leading 
rider at the track. 
</P>
<P>
 With an opening-day victory aboard Voraz, the heavy favorite in the sixth, a 6 
1/2-furlong race, Flores won his 186th race to move past the late Freddie 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 He added victories on Charlies Paradise in the $50,000 Bustles and Bows in the 
12th and with Simply Snow Chief in the 13th to complete a triple to increase 
his total to 188 winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the only rider with more winners is Francisco Mena with 248. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who started the day only two behind Mena on the all-time list for 
stakes winners with 32, closed to within one with his victory in the Bustles 
and Bows, one of three stakes races on the opening-day card. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking from the inside of a five-horse field of 2-year-old fillies going 6 
1/2 furlongs, Flores was content to let the speed horses go to the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed a little bit of patience because those other horses really went out 
fast," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Running fourth most of the way, Flores finally got Charlies Paradise in gear 
nearing the top of the stretch and wore down Shu Biz Annie to win by a 
half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his big opening day, Flores really wasn't impressed, especially with 
his standing on the riding list. "I know that Mena has a lot more than me, but 
I didn't know I was already second," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who had a share of the riding title in 1989, has won the last four 
outright. 
</P>
<P>
 After missing chances in the fourth and fifth races, Flores thought he had a 
good chance to win with Voraz, a 3-year-old trained by Caesar Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought my horse would go to the front, but he got lazy and didn't do much 
early," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voraz, breaking from the seventh post, was taken wide on the first turn. He 
was sixth going down the backstretch and started to make his move approaching 
the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Voraz started passing tired horses and was fourth entering the stretch, then 
ran down Silver Paladin to win by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rotsaluck, ridden by Fernando Valenzuela, was a four-length winner over 
heavily favored Ocean Indien in the $50,000 Foothill Stakes, one of three 
stakes on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Indien, with Kent Desormeaux aboard, was bumped coming out of the gate. 
He moved to the rail, trying to make up ground, but instead lost ground by 
going wide around the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotsaluck, owned by Loyal E. Crownover and trained by Vladmir Cerdin, was 
never further back than third. He made his move on the far turn and pulled away 
steadily in the stretch. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Mongoose First, owned by Tom McEwen and trained by Dennis Givens, won the 
$10,000 Express Stakes for quarter horses in the third race. Ridden by 
Guillermo Gutierrez, Mongoose First broke fast from the outside and covered the 
350 yards in a hand-time 17.60 seconds. . . . Front-running Persistant Sal and 
late-running Malibu Light head a field of seven 3-year-old fillies going in the 
$50,000 Las Ninas Stakes, one of two stakes races scheduled today.

LOS ALAMITOS; DOWN WITH DEBT A THREAT TO REFRIGERATOR'S REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine quarter horses are entered in tonight's $100,000 Vessels Maturity at Los 
Alamitos, among them some of the best aged runners in the country -- and the 
race may well be a rematch of last month's Go Man Go Handicap, with much of the 
attention on defending world champion Refrigerator and the tough mare, Down 
With Debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, Refrigerator was almost sure to win any race he ran.Owned 
by Jim Helzer, Refrigerator won 20 of 28 starts, never finishing lower than 
third. Then the gelding raced Down With Debt in the Go Man Go. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenging her loss to Refrigerator in last year's Champion of Champions, Down 
With Debt easily won the Go Man Go on Aug. 12. Refrigerator finished fourth for 
the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not getting any younger, but that was a tough race," said Refrigerator's 
trainer Blane Schvaneveldt. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Schvaneveldt, Refrigerator suffered from sore feet before the Go 
Man Go, but has been training well lately.  
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator will also race Go Man Go runner-up Avison in the Vessels 
Maturity, the eighth race on tonight's card. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the featured Vessels Maturity, stakes races for thoroughbreds and 
Arabians will also be run tonight. Thoroughbreds will compete in two divisions 
of the $15,000 Cypress Claiming Handicap, and 3-year-old Arabians are featured 
in two divisions of the $30,000 California Arabian Cup Juvenile. STACY PIGOTT

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: DEFENDING CHAMPION RETURNS MINUS BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Hanson came from farther behind than any driver in unlimited hydroplane 
history to win the Texaco Star Cup race last year at San Diego, and in this 
year's second event he won four races at Lewisville Lake in Texas to keep the 
Miss Budweiser boat in contention for its 15th national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the boats line up this weekend at Mission Bay for the San Diego 
Bayfair unlimited race, Hanson, having lost his boat, will be working as a 
crewman on the Miss Exide boat, trying to help Mark Evans win his first race 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hanson won in San Diego last year, he was driving the Kellogg's Frosted 
Flakes boat -- owned by the 13,000 citizens of Madison, Ind. -- and had to win 
a "last chance" heat to make the final, which he started as a trailer boat -- 
five seconds behind the other starters. When three boats dropped out and the 
favored Miss Budweiser was penalized a lap, Hanson picked off what boats were 
left and became the first trailer boat to win an unlimited hydroplane race. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson and the Kellogg's boat finished second in the season standings, but 
when the sponsorship was withdrawn for 1994, the boat was parked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible disappointment for everyone in Madison, but when you start 
spending your own dollars (to finance a hydroplane), there can be no end to 
it," said Bob Hughes, president of the group that maintains and races the boat, 
usually known as Miss Madison. "We raised enough money to run it once, in our 
own race, the Indiana Governor's Cup, in Madison, but that was all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, without a boat to drive, went to the opening race, the Gold Cup in 
Detroit, to help the Miss Exide team. When Chip Hanauer, driver of Miss 
Budweiser and a seven-time national champion, was injured during practice, boat 
owner Bernie Little asked Hanson to drive in hopes of picking up vital team 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dream come true and a nightmare at the same time," Hanson said. 
"Saturday was the worst day I ever spent in my life. The circumstances were 
monumental. I was in a boat I had always dreamed of driving, in Detroit, in the 
Gold Cup, but only because Chip was hurt. I was in the premier boat in the 
fleet, in the biggest race of the year, and I was miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason was because Hanson is short and thickset and Hanauer is 
tall and thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feet wouldn't touch the pedals," Hanson said. "The Budweiser crew put foam 
in the seat to lift me up, but I could barely see over the deck, and then they 
had to screw quarter-inch bolts in the pedals to make them high enough so I 
could operate them." 
</P>
<P>
 And Hanson had none of his own racing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "My helmet was back in the hotel, but because (Hanauer's accident) happened 
between heats, there was no time to get it. I had to wear one of (former 
driver) Jim Kropfeld's helmets that was in the Budweiser trailer and I wore a 
uniform they took off a fuel truck safety worker who was about my size." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hanson's first heat in a boat that had set a course record the day before 
-- and with no practice time -- he came around the tight first turn and nearly 
ran into a retaining wall in front of a grandstand full of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wasn't as scared as much as everyone else," Hanson recalled. "For 
one reason, I could barely see. When I hit a wake and the boat bounced, my 
borrowed face mask came down over my face and by the time I got it straightened 
out -- it was probably only about a half-second, but when you travel 150 feet 
in that time, it's scary -- I was headed for the wall. When I saw where I was, 
I took evasive action but I didn't have time to be scared -- until later." 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, with his own helmet, a newly constructed cockpit with reachable 
pedals and practice time in the boat, Hanson won all three heats and the final 
round in Texas. The 1,600 points he earned for Miss Budweiser went a long way 
toward the boat's current total of 8,288, only 66 ahead of Smokin' Joe's boat 
driven by Mark Tate, with two races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bernie Little told me he was pleased with my performance, and I thought I'd 
drive the Bud boat in a couple more races because we all thought Chip would sit 
them out, but when he came back earlier than expected, I was out of a ride 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson will be working with the propeller on Evans' boat this weekend, but he 
will have his helmet at his side when qualifying starts today -- just in case.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: REDLANDS APPEARS READY TO BECOME TOP DOG AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't matter that Redlands' football team finished tied for third last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter that more than half the coaching staff left to coach 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't matter if they played without pads because the rest of the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Assn. would still pick the 
Bulldogs to finish first. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last season, Redlands was so dominating that people were calling the 
SCIAC "Snow White and the Six Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Redlands finished 3-3 in conference play last season, 6-3 overall, and La 
Verne won the SCIAC title. So one might think that the other schools would be 
licking their chops. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they're minding their manners.  
</P>
<P>
 There were whispers that Redlands became complacent last year. Sure, the rash 
of injuries that hit the Bulldogs was real, but in the past they simply plugged 
in new players. If only modestly, opponents enjoyed last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're afraid the monster is awake again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I didn't see it, complacency may have been a part of it last year," 
Redlands Coach Mike Maynard said. "I don't want to make excuses, but we did 
have a lot of injuries and our (reserves) were not ready. That may have been my 
fault. This year I am confident our kids will play hard and really care."  
</P>
<P>
 They cared on Saturday, and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands opened by beating Azusa Pacific, 31-14. The Bulldogs showed they plan 
to run more this year. Fullback Matt Figueroa scored three times and tailback 
Anthony Jones rushed for 115 yards in 26 carries.  
</P>
<P>
 "Figueroa looks like he's the other part of the one-two punch with Jones," 
Maynard said. "He's the key to the inside running game, but if you're going to 
stop Redlands -- you have to stop Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't happen often last season. Jones rushed for 1,042 yards in nine 
games, scored 11 touchdowns and averaged more than six yards a carry.  
</P>
<P>
 The defense is led by middle linebacker Brett Wixom, who was the SCIAC player 
of the year as a sophomore before injuries kept him out of most of the last two 
seasons. Along with free safety Gary Giannoni, Wixom leads a very physical 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Maynard doesn't want to be the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a long way to go," he said. "We're not with La Verne and Occidental 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 No, they might be a shade above. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Redlands comes back strong, no one will be stunned if La Verne repeats 
as SCIAC champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the Leopards (7-2 overall, 6-0 in the SCIAC last year) have the 
offense to keep them in a lot of games -- they beat Menlo last Saturday, 42-38. 
But Coach Rex Huigens is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with all those points, the offense has a lot of things to work on," he 
said. "We got a lot of big plays but didn't put together very many long 
drives." 
</P>
<P>
 That is bound to happen in La Verne's double-slot offense -- a spread-out 
version of the run-and-shoot. Sophomore receiver Anthony Rice, a big-play man, 
scored on 65- and 79-yard pass plays. Junior quarterback Ryan Campuzano, in his 
second season as a starter, can run the offense as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental (8-1, 5-1) presents a different set of problems with its 
triple-option running game. After scoring twice in last season's opener, the 
Tigers increased their scoring total for six consecutive weeks -- culminating 
in a 68-point effort against Claremont Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players return, foremost among them quarterback Davin Lundquist. 
Lundquist led the team in rushing with 880 yards and 11 touchdowns and passed 
for six more scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (5-4, 3-3) and Whittier (4-5, 3-3) are enigmas.  
</P>
<P>
 Most SCIAC coaches believe that Cal Lutheran will be a big factor in the race 
with its strong defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But replacing quarterback Adam Hacker will be difficult. How well Ryan 
Huisenga, his replacement, develops will be a main factor in Cal Lutheran's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier is a young team -- 35 freshmen and 10 junior college transfers -- 
that will probably surprise some teams.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific and Chapman will play independent schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, which will field a team for the first time in 62 years, already has 
people worried. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one SCIAC coach referred to Chapman as loaded with talent. Huigens 
said, "The (SCIAC) is very fortunate they're not in it, otherwise it would be a 
lot tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Whittier coach Ken Visser recruited well from both high schools and 
junior colleges. His first test will be at Whittier on Saturday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the final season for Azusa Pacific Coach Jim Milhon, who has 
coached the Cougars since 1978. He will retire after the season. He has 29 
players back from last year's 3-6 team. College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Los Angeles is off to a great start in fall sports. The women's 
volleyball team, ranked 10th, is 9-0 after two tournaments. That ties a school 
record for consecutive victories. The men's soccer team, ranked 17th, is 4-0 
after one tournament. The second-ranked women's cross-country team won the 
Whittier Invitational Saturday. . . . Azusa Pacific was named by the NAIA as 
the winner of the men's all-sports trophy.

PLENTY OF RIPTIDES ON 'WATERWORLD' SET; WITH KEY CREW PEOPLE QUITTING AND 
REPORTED TURMOIL, LOGISTICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS, THE BIG-BUDGET FILM, 
SCHEDULED FOR RELEASE IN SUMMER OF '95, COULD END UP COSTING MORE THAN ANY

 Two of the entertainment industry's most powerful players, MCA president 
Sidney Sheinberg and superagent Michael Ovitz, led a high-level contingent to 
Hawaii last week to inspect personally what is looming as the most costly movie 
in Hollywood history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waterworld," a futuristic " 'Road Warrior' on the water" adventure picture 
starring Kevin Costner and slated to be Universal's biggest summer movie of 
'95, now has a projected budget of around $135 million and is already two weeks 
behind schedule. The movie -- which also stars Dennis Hopper, Jeanne 
Tripplehorn and Tina Majorino -- is set in a post-apocalyptic future when polar 
icecaps have melted and the earth is submerged in water. Costner plays the 
hero, Mariner, a creature with gills and fins who attempts to lead the 
surviving good humans to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Costner's close friend, Kevin Reynolds, and being filmed on an 
elaborate floating set off the Kona Coast, the production has been beset by 
turmoil and plagued by logistical and organizational problems, according to 
interviews with several sources connected to the production. And some key crew 
members, including the assistant director and special effects designer, have 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources characterized the shoot as "extremely difficult," "chaotic" and "out 
of control." One described the production as "a runaway train under water." 
Another said, "No one is running the show, and the environment is hostile to 
the detriment of the film." 
</P>
<P>
 When delays and cost overruns escalated last week, Sheinberg and Ovitz decided 
to board the MCA corporate jet, along with MCA motion picture chairman Tom 
Pollock, Universal president Casey Silver and physical production head Donna 
Smith and fly to the movie's set on the Big Island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg said that while he was mindful that his presence on a set "can have 
a chilling effect on people," he came at the personal invitation of Costner and 
his Universal colleagues. He said it was not unusual for him to visit the sets 
of the studio's bigger productions, as he did last year with Steven Spielberg's 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 The MCA chief was invited to the "Waterworld" set by Costner's agent, Creative 
Artists Agency head Ovitz, who reportedly urged Sheinberg to make the trip 
since the executive had had extensive experience with difficult productions, 
including the 1975 thriller "Jaws." 
</P>
<P>
 Ovitz was there apparently to protect the interests of one of his most 
important clients, as well as to run interference with MCA and the filmmakers, 
who include producers Charles Gordon and his brother Lawrence Gordon, who is 
not personally receiving screen credit but is actively involved in the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg, who for the first time publicly confirmed that "Waterworld" was 
greenlit at $100 million, told The Times that he was in part prompted to fly to 
the set because "this is a very big, expensive movie, and I did want to go and 
see what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The MCA president said his main purpose in visiting the set "was to be sure 
everyone was pulling together in the same direction to get the picture made and 
that delays would be no greater than they had to be . . . it could be the most 
difficult picture ever made." 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with Costner, Reynolds and the producers, Sheinberg said he was 
"satisfied" and "very comfortable" with how things were running. "Knock on 
wood, I'm quite pleased with everything I've seen so far."  
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg admitted that "my biggest fear is that the unforeseen will happen 
with the weather and the water." But he refuted allegations that "Waterworld" 
is a production out of control: "It's simply not true -- none of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources working on the movie, however, paint a grim picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody realized the magnitude of the problems with making a movie like this 
and how the logistics are so impossible," said one source. "It's slow going and 
setting up the shots (on the water) take forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the production began June 27, Universal executives have made several 
trips to the movie's set to try to address mounting problems. Several members 
of the nearly 500-person crew have either been fired or walked off the picture, 
including assistant director Alan Curtiss, who reportedly left over creative 
differences. Curtiss refused to comment, although an experienced Hollywood 
filmmaker suggested that when a first assistant director "up and quits, that's 
not a good sign. That means they don't like what they're seeing and have 
concluded that all of their efforts are for naught." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources on the set say most of the problems in delays and cost overruns stem 
from shooting on water and from the logistical problems of coordinating some 30 
boats and a crew that constantly has to be shuttled from the Kawaihae Harbor on 
the west side of the island to the set a quarter-mile offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike filming on land, anything you do on water is just more difficult. The 
wind is constantly changing," one source said. "If you are lining up a shot, 
things are always moving, they are never going to stay in the same place."  
</P>
<P>
 For example, several sources said it took four weeks to film one battle scene 
in which 125 actors on the floating city were attacked by 50 villains. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane weather in Hawaii, which plagued Universal's production of "Jurassic 
Park" in 1992, continues to be of concern to the "Waterworld" team, but so far 
the production has escaped serious damage. Several hurricanes passed by the 
islands, creating high swells, but they did not cause any substantial delays, 
says a source, although hurricane season is not yet over. 
</P>
<P>
 With the production not even halfway through its shoot, sources say that 
morale on the set has sunk and tempers have flared. Some crew members have been 
targeted as scapegoats. Sources say physical effects designer Peter Chesney and 
effects liaison Kate Steinberg, who have been with the project for more than a 
year, were being pushed off the picture, so they quit in early August. They 
declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gordons, producer John Davis and executive producers Andy Licht and 
Jeffrey Mueller also refused to comment on all matters regarding "Waterworld."  
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled to shoot 96 days, including several weeks of additional 
effects work and filming in Los Angeles, the movie was to have wrapped by 
year's end, but now is not expected to be completed until early 1995. The 
Hawaii portion of the shoot is expected to be finished by late November or 
early December. If the movie is not completed until January or early February, 
as some suggest, it could put a big strain on Reynolds to deliver a finished 
print by Universal's hoped-for July release date. 
</P>
<P>
 "With an investment and picture of this size, you can't slam the movie 
together in the editing room," says one veteran filmmaker. "You have to have 
time to test the movie (with preview audiences) and go back and fix what's 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Universal's financial risk is so huge, the studio will want to ensure 
the movie as much substantial summer playing time as possible. This summer, 
which tallied a record box-office gross of $2.2 billion, delivered more than a 
half-dozen films with ticket sales each exceeding $100 million. Two of those 
blockbusters, "The Lion King" and "Forrest Gump," grossed more than $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each week you hold a picture beyond Memorial Day, it costs you summer playing 
time," says one industry insider, noting, "On a movie as costly as 'Waterworld' 
you want to give it as much time to make back its money and get into profit as 
you can." (Naturally, there are exceptions to the rule as was the case with 
"The Fugitive," which was released Aug. 6, 1993, and grossed more than $180 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Universal has not yet officially slated "Waterworld," but is undoubtedly 
hoping to release it over the heavy moviegoing Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Costner and Reynolds, who collaborated on 1991's "Robin Hood: Prince of 
Thieves" and on the recent, disappointing "Rapa Nui," are well-known 
perfectionists who take their time in the postproduction process. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the lackluster box-office performance of this summer's three-hour 
Western, "Wyatt Earp," Costner -- one of Hollywood's most highly paid stars, 
undoubtedly has been banking on "Waterworld" to wow audiences next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the reported length of the script of "Waterworld," some wonder whether 
Costner will deliver yet another long movie. He has personally done rewrites on 
the script, especially the third act, as has Reynolds. Joss Whedon, who did an 
uncredited rewrite on this summer's big action hit "Speed," also spent weeks on 
the set polishing the script. Originally scripted by Peter Rader, the movie has 
gone through a number of drafts. David Twohy ("The Fugitive") will share 
screenwriting credit with Rader. 
</P>
<P>
 One experienced filmmaker noted: "All movies get rewritten during production 
to one degree or another. But on movies this big and complex, the essential 
story line and characters need to be locked before the cameras roll -- 
otherwise the ramifications are huge." One of the questions MCA will inevitably 
raise to the moviemakers, suggested the source, is "how this movie ever got 
going without a script being locked." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all of its rewrites, production problems and cost overruns, 
"Waterworld" has the potential of being a blockbuster, much in the same way 
that "Jaws," which also had problems during its filming, became one of the 
biggest box-office draws of all time. The 1975 movie, which cost around $9 
million, nearly 100% over budget, went on to gross $260 million domestically. 
"Waterworld" now joins Hollywood's list of the most costly movies of all time, 
including this summer's Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle, "True Lies," which 
reportedly had a $118-million price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg said he hopes "Waterworld," which he called a "big, unique action 
picture," will "even be bigger than 'Jaws.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Based on seeing some dailies of the movie, Sheinberg said, "I really believe 
this picture has enormous potential. . . . Do I wish it had cost a lot less? Of 
course. But I'd rather have this movie than two 'Havanas,' " referring to 
Universal's 1990 box-office bomb directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Robert 
Redford. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg, who was on his way to temple to observe Yom Kippur, said: "I'm 
going to pray for ("Waterworld's") successful and timely completion."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: 'BASEBALL' LIKE THE GAME: SOME HITS, RUNS, 
ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg

<P>
 For his contributions to the historical documentary, Ken Burns deserves to 
have his number retired. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the nation's foremost telestorian. His impressive body of work on PBS 
culminated in 1990 with "The Civil War," a seminal, 11-hour series whose 
spectacular critical praise and surprising popularity at least briefly 
transfused TV documentaries and enabled his Florentine Films to proceed at full 
speed with his latest tome. 
</P>
<P>
 The even-longer -- much, much longer -- "Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Sunday: An extraordinary 18 1/2 hours split into nine evenings -- or 
episodes, called "Innings" -- a chronology from the 1840s to the 1990s, during 
which Burns exhilarates you . . . and bores you. Yogi Berra was right: "It 
ain't over 'til it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball" takes a long time getting over. At times, in fact, you might think 
you're in reverse, watching "The Civil War" again, so closely do the new 
documentary's opening hours, in particular, resemble its predecessor in style 
and presentation.  
</P>
<P>
 Imagine hearing the following, backed by a sorrowful violin: "Virginia, April 
3, 1862. It is astonishing how indifferent a person can become to danger. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not Northern trooper Elisha Hunt Rhodes checking in from the 
battlefield, but another Union soldier writing home about playing "bat ball" as 
a diversion from the war. The resemblance to "The Civil War" is furthered by 
the return of many of its off-camera voices. And if you didn't know John 
Chancellor was supplying the narration -- quite adroitly, by the way -- you'd 
swear it was David McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this familiarity intensifies the torpor you experience from time to 
time as this incremental marathon plays out. Yet even when "Baseball" is 
finally done -- and you're as limp as someone who has sat through an 18-inning 
game while praying for someone to mercifully hit one out of the park and end it 
-- you have the impression that Burns and his collaborators are still on the 
edges of their seats desiring more, having bitten off less than they want to 
chew. 
</P>
<P>
 So great is their worship at the cleats of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of the "Baseball" scheduling -- timed originally to immediately 
precede the Major League playoffs and World Series -- has Ruthian size. We now 
know there won't be postseason play in 1994. There won't even be any more 
pre-postseason. Just Wednesday, the rest of the season was canceled due to a 
players' strike that has forced Americans to live without the game that 
"Baseball" asserts Americans cannot possibly live without. Yet, so far, life 
for most has proceeded routinely minus the sport that writer Robert Creamer 
insists in "Baseball" is "more fun than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 In large patches, so is this documentary. At its very best, "Baseball" soars 
over the timeless plain of U.S. history like a ball being lofted out of the 
park. Again echoing "The Civil War," it entertainingly relives the texture of 
the times, unfurling itself like Old Glory, conveying with humor, scholarship, 
music, diary readings, anecdotes and wonderful old grainy archival footage how 
the sport's evolution has tightly interlocked with the evolution of the nation. 
And how, as a common denominator, it permeates all layers of society. 
</P>
<P>
 At its very, very best, "Baseball" plucks from the shadows of relative 
obscurity the old Negro Leagues that sprouted and blossomed in response to the 
sport's segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball" is never more charming than when a couple of black old-timers spin 
tales about fabled hurler Satchel Paige. At long last, Burns mounts the likes 
of Paige and the lesser-known Buck O'Neil and Josh Gibson on the pedestal they 
deserve. In fact, he tracks white and black baseball almost as parallel 
stories, ones that will intersect at the juncture of Jackie Robinson and 
Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey in the mid-1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's courage in the face of ignorance as the first black player of the 
modern era allowed into the lily-white majors -- here was an athlete whose 
on-field prowess did translate to heroism -- is heroically recounted here. As 
are the stories of Curt Flood, Ty Cobb and, naturally, the bamboozing bambino 
himself, Babe Ruth. "In an age of conspicuous consumption," says Chancellor, 
"he was the most conspicuous consumer of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball" at times is so laborious, however, that it takes Burns more than 
five hours just to get to the Black Sox Scandal of 1919. But this blemish on 
the sport, in which eight members of the Chicago White Sox were bribed to throw 
the World Series, is so indelibly depicted that it's well worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two-hour episode of "Baseball" is a melodic overture, introducing a 
sports history rich in color, legend and continuity. Words from 1868: "Somehow 
or other, they don't play ball the way they used to eight or 10 years ago." 
Words from 1870: "Baseball is a business now." 
</P>
<P>
 In one old photo, Civil War soldiers play ball in front of their tents. In 
another, men in black derbies are eyes left, their attention riveted to the 
field. We see the first curveball, the first professional team, the first 
Louisville Slugger bat, the first hot dog. We see early experimental uniforms, 
a different color for each position that, someone observes, looked "like a 
Dutch bed of tulips." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout its history, baseball's legends have fattened on hyperbole -- 
ever-growing fish stories that have fused with contemporary sports culture. 
Walter Johnson's famed fastball, Cobb is said to have said, "just hissed with 
danger." And as for the volatile Cobb himself, a sportswriter wrote, he was "a 
cyclone, a tornado, a typhoon, all rolled into one." So much so that we hear of 
opposing players "fleeing the field to avoid his raised spikes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Grover Cleveland Alexander didn't merely walk to the mound. No, 
sir, he strode "in from the bullpen through the gray mist." And "Cool Papa" 
Bell was said to be "so fast he once scored from first on a sacrifice bunt." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball" amiably accepts at face value these so-called eyewitness accounts 
passed down from generation to generation. And with no TV pictures to rebut 
them -- nothing reduces an immortal to ordinary size like seeing him muff a fly 
ball in the outfield -- they're now part of the lore. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, then, that the nearer "Baseball" gets to the present, the thinner 
its magic. The last several hours' devotion to various World Series and players 
in the 1970s-1990s era come across as a variation on a theme by ESPN. At this 
point, in particular, the wordiness becomes oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball" needs more of those "mini-seconds of stillness" that one of its 
contributors, poet Donald Hall, attributes to the sport. At its very worst, it 
is too long, too repetitious, too tediously thick with the gaseously 
pretentious rhetoric of professional super-fans who form a human internet of 
adoration, sounding like addicts in praise of heroin. When they speak about 
baseball, their eyes light up like electronic scoreboards. Couldn't Billy 
Crystal say baseball's just mahhhhvelous and leave it at that? 
</P>
<P>
 Never has a single metaphor been stretched by so many. You have the impression 
that Burns himself could make a metaphor even out of Jacks (round rubber ball 
like the globe . . .). In this documentary, baseball is inflated into a 
metaphor not only for the United States but also for all humankind. You could 
just as easily stretch a baseball cover across a bowling ball. 
</P>
<P>
 You know it's time for some people to get a life when: 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington Post sportswriter Thomas Boswell says baseball "makes the more 
important moments of living bearable." 
</P>
<P>
 * Writer-editor Dan Okrent likens baseball to a "Russian novel" and, in only 
half jest, calls the game "the Darwinian product of centuries of movement of 
people and continents and oceans and something rising from the sea and their 
turning eventually, after years of evolution, to Barry Bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 * Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin says that Boston Red Sox catcher Carlton 
Fisk's vivid body language, while seeing his dramatic home run in the 1975 
World Series almost drift foul, represents "all of us (wishing) we could 
control our destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to justify this hemorrhaging of air time, there's even more gale-force 
hot air about baseball's significance. Okrent sees uniqueness in baseball's 
"common language of statistics," as if other sports did not speak that 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It highlights the individual like no other sport does," says Bob Costas. Tell 
that to Joe Montana or Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a community," says former minor leaguer Mario Cuomo, now governor of 
New York. "You need all nine people helping each other." As if teamwork were 
not equally as crucial in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen just how many viewers will stay around even to hear all 
of this. Make a documentary and they will come? Perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Baseball" premieres at 8 p.m. Sunday on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15, and at 7 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. It will continue through 
Thursday at the same times, then will be off for two days, resuming Sept. 
25-28. * PRE-SELLING THE SHOW

'BURNING SEASON' EMERGES FROM THE ASHES; MOVIES: AFTER SEVERAL FALSE STARTS, 
THE STORY ABOUT SLAIN BRAZILIAN RUBBER TAPPER CHICO MENDES WILL AIR ON HBO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after Brazilian rubber tapper Chico Mendes was assassinated in 
December, 1988, the film world fell all over itself in an effort to secure the 
rights to his story. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg, Robert Redford, Peter Guber, Ted Turner and ex-Columbia head 
David Puttnam all joined in the scramble for what became one of the most 
coveted movie projects in Hollywood history.  
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the frenzy, in early 1989, a host of Hollywood heavyweights 
descended upon the Brazilian rain forest (a seven-hour journey with three 
stopovers from Rio de Janeiro). Guber even set up private screenings of his 
movies in a tiny theater in the heart of the Amazon for Mendes' widow. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as it turned out, that was all for naught. Only now, almost 
anticlimactically, has a project finally emerged about the slain environmental 
activist and labor organizer: "The Burning Season," based on the book of the 
same name by Andrew Revkin, airs Saturday on HBO with Raul Julia as Mendes. 
</P>
<P>
 With Puttnam as the executive producer, the project was originally conceived 
as a feature film starring Andy Garcia. It was to be produced by Warner Bros. 
under an agreement with Puttnam's Enigma Productions. But after commissioning 
several scripts and even building film sets in Costa Rica, Warner Bros. decided 
to drop its option. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO stepped in and scooped up the project, and Puttnam, who had bought the 
rights to Revkin's book, stayed attached to the project as executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Puttnam said he persisted in wanting to make the movie because he saw it as an 
important "personal journey," as opposed to simply a way to make money, as 
other filmmakers had. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw (this story) as a way of making quite quick money in a fairly 
expedient manner," Puttnam said in a phone interview from his home in Ireland. 
"Those people tend to not make a long journey (kind of film). If things don't 
come together in six months, they go on to other things. There's too many hot 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time of all the hysteria, I was interviewed along with a lot of other 
people and the press was saying that I was the least likely to succeed. I 
didn't have a big name attached and I remember at the time saying, 'It's a 
long, long process.' I remember saying it's one business where the tortoise can 
still beat the hare." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In between the early flurry of offers in the late '80s and the project begun 
by HBO in 1993, the rights to the story went from Mendes' widow, Ilzamar, to 
J.N. Films, a little-known Brazilian-based production company, to Peter Guber 
to Warner Bros. to Puttnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood offers to Mendes' widow and rubber-tappers in his hometown of Xapuri 
ranged from offering to pay for worldwide television commercials to promote the 
preservation of the rain forest to dangling hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
Mendes' family and the foundation he started. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford proposed a feature to be directed by Steven Spielberg and financed by 
20th Century Fox. He drafted Brazilian actress Sonia Braga -- whom he had 
directed in "The Milagro Beanfield War" and who ultimately starred in the HBO 
movie -- to smooth the way with local Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner did produce a documentary on Mendes that aired on TBS in 1989, but also 
vied for the rights to a made-for-television movie. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, HBO was also involved in attempting to secure the rights in order 
to produce a four-hour miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan U. Schwartz, a Los Angeles attorney retained by the Chico Mendes 
Foundation shortly after the environmentalist's death, was involved in the 
negotiations surrounding these offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said that he and others lobbied members of the foundation urging them 
to agree on one filmmaker who should do the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went down to Rio Brava with Steve Schwartzman of the Environmental Defense 
Fund in Washington, D.C., and we went over all the proposals with the rubber 
tappers' board," Schwartz said in a phone interview. "They couldn't really get 
their act together to decide on all the proposals. They were involved in a 
political campaign there, and there was a problem with the widow, who had made 
her own deal (with J.N. Films), and they were trying to decide whether or not 
to stop her. The whole thing petered out."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, he said, "All those proposals went away and David (Puttnam) made his own 
arrangements with the widow and got the rights to the book ("The Burning 
Season")." 
</P>
<P>
 Ilzamar Mendes had sold the rights to J.N. Films "under nationalistic 
premises," based on her belief that her husband had been against the 
internationalization of the rain forest and would not have liked the 
internationalization of his story, according to a source close to the original 
negotiations. The production company, the source said, "had no wherewithal to 
do the film" and sold the rights to Peter Guber for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber was with Warner Bros. at that time, and so the rights transferred to 
Warners. When Guber left for Sony, the rights to Mendes' story stayed with 
Warners, which then hooked up with Puttnam. 
</P>
<P>
 When Warners decided to let the rights lapse, Puttnam was the only original 
player left, said Glenn Whitehead, HBO's West Coast vice president of business 
affairs and production. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO based its movie on Revkin's book and on "The Decade of Destruction," a 
book by British documentary filmmaker Adrian Cowell. Screenwriters on the final 
project included William Mastrosimone, Michael Tolkin and Ron Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Hollywood hoopla surrounding the story has left observers wondering 
what happened, why all the other players in the contest scratched their plans 
for future movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess these things sort of blossom and disappear like spring flowers," said 
author Revkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Or like the trees in the Brazilian rain forest.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; STEELY DAN PUTS ON A PLEASANT BUT NOT POWERFUL HIT PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The records of Steely Dan are triumphs of studio technique and jazzy 
craftsmanship, and there's probably no better way to test high-end stereo 
equipment than to crank up "Aja" or "Countdown to Ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
 Their music becomes more problematic in live settings though, and in a pair of 
hourlong sets at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion on Wednesday, the studio 
wizards failed to cast a powerful spell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dan brain trust -- keyboardist-singer Donald Fagen and guitarist-singer 
Walter Becker -- did produce some slickly satisfying sounds. And, backed by an 
eight-piece band and three backup singers, the duo clearly enjoyed bringing 
their estimable catalogue of cryptic hits to an enthusiastic crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But the darker edges were gone from quirky, complex works such as "Deacon 
Blues," "Chain Lightning" and "Babylon Sisters" -- the music was simply 
pleasant rather than provocative.  
</P>
<P>
 Becker's offhand guitar licks added some spark to several songs, and "Hard Up 
Case," from his forthcoming solo album, had the band playing lean and mean. The 
black-clad Fagen, in trademark shades and sporting a scraggly beard, added some 
fire to "Black Friday" and "Tomorrow's Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 But too many other tunes were run through in a smoothed-over, perfunctory 
fashion. Not until the energetic encores of "My Old School" and "FM" did the 
band really cut loose.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year's tour was notable for being Steely Dan's first in 19 years. This 
year the group continues to deliver the same polished Steely hit parade. 
Although there's no denying the craft and style in Becker and Fagen's music, 
the show Wednesday was more countdown than ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steely Dan plays tonight and Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 
Irvine Center Drive, Irvine, 8 p.m. $22.50-$40. (714) 855-4515. CHUCK

RESTAURANT NOTES: TROTTER SETS PLACE FOR VEGAS HIGH ROLLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA, TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Desert Trotter: Both Wolfgang Puck and Mark Miller already have restaurants in 
the MGM Grand. Now the Las Vegas mega-hotel and casino is adding a small, 
exclusive establishment for its high-rolling clientele. They're spending $3 
million to build the young Chicago chef Charlie Trotter his second restaurant. 
Trotter is excited about taking his stylish French cooking to the glitzy desert 
city. "Las Vegas now has a budding AIWF (American Institute of Wine and Food) 
chapter. And with Wolfgang and Mark Miller to pave the way, I think in the next 
couple of years, there's going to be a real gastronomic explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Trotter Las Vegas will have much of the look and feel of his elegant 
eponymous Chicago restaurant, the chef said. Like the original, the decor will 
be based on the Viennese Secessionist period of the early 1900s. The plates 
will be Limoges, the silverware Christofle, the linens Pratesi, the flowers 
grand. Even so, it all sounds a little understated for Las Vegas. The format is 
definitely new: The 70-seat restaurant will have a single six-course tasting 
menu each night (with an option for vegetarians). No buffet? 
</P>
<P>
 New Year's Eve is the official opening date. "We're working around the clock," 
says Trotter. To get a preview, sign up for Trotter's cooking class Oct. 9 at 
Let's Get Cooking in Westlake Village. His cookbook titled "Charlie Trotter" 
should be out in October from Ten Speed Press. 
</P>
<P>
 California Cache: The chef behind California Frog Cafe Inc., the corporation 
that now holds the liquor license for the old Champagne Bis site on Little 
Santa Monica, does indeed turn out to be Jean Francois Meteigner. Just as 
suspected. The former L'Orangerie chef will open his new French-California 
restaurant for dinner on Oct. 1; lunch starts the 11th. Its name is "La 
Cachette" -- "hideaway" in French. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu runs the gamut from bistro dishes to more sophisticated fare, but the 
emphasis, says Meteigner, will be on natural, light cooking. "Ninety-five 
percent of the recipes will not have any butter or cream. Instead, I'll be 
using natural jus and reductions." A sneak peek of the menu reveals Dungeness 
crab and lobster bisque with rouille and croutons; homemade smoked whitefish 
salad with warm potatoes and capers; rotisserie-roasted chicken with Provencal 
herbs and roasted garlic potatoes. Appetizers are $3.50 to $14; entrees $11 to 
$20. "The concept is good value, light cuisine and a great atmosphere," says 
Meteigner. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals on Wheels: Break out those chaps, those snakeskin boots and that dusty 
ride-'em-cowboy chapeau. For the 12th year, Wolfgang Puck and his wife and 
partner, Barbara Lazaroff, are putting on the ritz for the American Wine and 
Food Festival on Sept. 24. This year's theme is "A Western Night" -- outdoors 
at the "Roman Forum" on the back lot of Universal Studios. Does that mean togas 
and ten-gallons? 
</P>
<P>
 Old L.A. hands like Jonathan Waxman, Lydia Shire, Hiro Sone and David and 
Annie Gingrass are flying in to cook for the event. Emeril Lagasse and Paul 
Prudhomme are coming from New Orleans, Dean Fearing from the Mansion on Turtle 
Creek in Dallas, Larry Forgione from An American Place in NYC and Mark Miller 
from the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe and more. L.A.'s finest will lend a hand too: 
Joachim Splichal, Piero Selvaggio, Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton, Makoto Tanaka 
and the newly bi-coastal Nobu Matsuhisa. And some 75 California wineries will 
be pouring their latest vintage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the mega-event are a steep $175, but the cause is eminently worthy: 
It's a benefit for Meals on Wheels, the organization that delivers hot meals 
daily to the elderly and homebound throughout Los Angeles. (For tickets, call 
(310) 652-3706.) 
</P>
<P>
 Trader Tang: Thai restaurateur Tommy Tang is in the money now; he recently 
signed a deal with the budget-gourmet grocery Trader Joe's. Starting next week 
all 57 stores will be offering two of Tang's fried rice dishes at $2.49. Now 
when you get that hankering for Jasmine Fried Rice or Spicy Basil Fried Rice, 
you can whiz on over to your local trading post and grab some take-home. Add a 
couple of the line-caught tuna steaks and it's a meal.

THEATER BEAT: PERFORMANCES SUPPORT 'FENCES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Fences," the new production of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play 
at the Studio Theatre of the Long Beach Playhouse, actor Billy Mayo brings fire 
to his lead role as an embittered former baseball star. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Wilson's epic cycle of plays about the African American experience in 
each decade of this century, "Fences" opens in 1957, during the dawn of a civil 
rights movement that came too late to ensure Troy Maxson (Mayo) a spot in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle-aged hero knows that racism played a role in blocking his athletic 
career, yet he is tormented by far more than that injustice. Over time he 
allows his disappointment with life to overwhelm his relations with others, 
leading him to cheat on his long-suffering wife Rose (a gloriously tough Robyn 
Hastings) and brutalize his teen-age son Cory (Kyle Jones). 
</P>
<P>
 Director Bill DeLuca and cast can do little to fence in the windy and 
repetitive lapses in Wilson's writing. Yet clear, honest performances propel 
the show at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Though too young for the part, Mayo brings off a delicate blend, 
simultaneously conveying Maxson's raw fury and tragic vulnerability. This 
quicksilver man trades easy bonhomie with sidekick Bono (Wichita Troublefield), 
then fiercely intimidates his family just moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy comes full circle for Maxson, whose problematic character finds fit 
expression in this handsome, frequently moving rendition. * "Fences," Studio 
Theatre , Long Beach Playhouse, 5021 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sunday and Oct. 9, 2 p.m. Ends Oct. 15. $10. (310) 
494-1616. Running time: 2 hours, 40 minutes. 'Treasons': Murder Mystery in 
London 
</P>
<P>
 The lower depths of 18th-Century London provide the setting for Jon Bastian's 
"Petty Treasons," at the Road Theatre Company in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a true story, Bastian's ambitious though strangely uninvolving murder 
mystery concerns an abusive miser, his wife and her two lovers. When the 
miser's head is found on the banks of the Thames, suspicion naturally centers 
on the me nage a trois back at the dead man's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrating the tale, after the passage of some 50 years, is Jack (Ken Sawyer), 
the hangman who disposed the case and remains haunted by its result. 
</P>
<P>
 As directed by Brad Hills, "Petty Treasons" convincingly depicts the 
historical period, at least in terms of costuming and Cockney dialects. Yet the 
text flounders between sordid whodunit and high-minded treatise on the morality 
of capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Petty Treasons," Road Theatre Company, 14141 Covello St. , No. 9D, Van 
Nuys. Fridays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends Oct. 16. $12.50. (818) 785-6175. Running 
time: 2 hours, 50 minutes. SCOTT COLLINS

 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who last week got the league's first 
over-the-air network TV contract in 20 years, is expected to use that deal to 
try to gain concessions from the NHL Players Assn. when the sides resume labor 
talks today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman was the force behind a five-year, $155-million agreement with the Fox 
network, as well as significant sponsorship ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope these agreements give the players cause for more optimism and they 
want to buy in a little more" to his plan for the NHL's growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, acknowledged that the Fox 
contract will influence the talks. "But to what degree, I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL and its players' union have not had a collective bargaining agreement 
since last September. A lockout is anticipated if a new agreement is not 
reached before the season opens on Oct. 1. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Darryl Henley was in the starting lineup Thursday in place of cornerback Steve 
Israel, who has been bothered by tendinitis in his knee, the result of chasing 
Atlanta's Andre Rison all over the field last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said he wasn't sure who would start the game against the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to wait and see how Israel's tendinitis is," Knox said. "We'll see 
who is ready and able on Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones missed practice because of a sore toe. Jones 
hurt his toe in Atlanta and it was stepped on in Wednesday's practice.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SCC WOMEN'S SOCCER MAKING GIANT 
STRIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last season at this time, Coach Scott Dameron still was scrambling to fill the 
roster of the Southern California College women's soccer team. Seven players 
showed for the first practice; 10 for the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 But memories of the Vanguards' 0-19-1 inaugural season are receding quickly. 
The Vanguards, who scored two goals in 1993, scored 11 on the first day of the 
1994 season, beating Mills College, 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a turnaround for a team that lost, 15-0, to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already beaten some teams that just killed us last year," Dameron 
said. "We played Claremont the other day -- I think they beat us, 13-0, or 
something last year. I think they came out expecting to do the same thing again 
and they found they were facing a good team. We even had a couple of chances to 
put it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont and SCC tied, 0-0, and after a 3-2 loss to Redlands and a 5-1 
victory over Biola, the Vanguards are 2-3-1 after losing to Azusa Pacific, 6-0, 
in their Golden State Athletic Conference opener Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dameron, who is also the girls' soccer coach at Newport Harbor High, has 
turned things around at SCC with an excellent recruiting class. Dameron has 
brought in 13 new players and now has a roster of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we'd have a harder time recruiting but I think people saw some good 
in the program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Pelletier, a freshman from Brethren Christian, leads the team with eight 
goals. Jamie Gardiner, a sophomore from Sunny Hills, has scored five. Katrina 
Bohn, a junior from San Clemente High who played last season, and Deann 
Salcido, a redshirt sophomore, anchor the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman midfielders Meggen Fleener, from Newport Harbor, and Dawn Chastain, 
from Esperanza, are also making their presence known. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main goal for us is to stay healthy," Dameron said. "If we can keep our 
good players healthy, we are good enough to beat anybody we play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Concordia men's soccer team is also making an impressive turnaround. The 
Eagles, who were 0-19 last season, are 2-0-1 this season, under new Coach Dave 
Irby. 
</P>
<P>
 Irby, who also coaches the Orange County Vanguard semipro club team, coached 
the Eagles in the 1988 and '89 seasons, leaving because he didn't have any 
help. This time he returns with three assistants -- former SCC standout Greg 
Olson, Villa Park boys' soccer Coach Pat Noyes and Phil Brance, who has coached 
goalkeepers at El Toro High -- and is enthusiastic about the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the best team they've had here," Irby said. "When I was here 
before, I didn't have 11 legitimate college starters and I would say we do 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Irby is working with much the same team as the Eagles fielded last year. Three 
senior captains -- midfielder Brian Beaman, forward Kyle Thomas and defender 
Dean Agnoletto -- are mainstays. Beaman and Thomas played for Irby and the 
Orange County Vanguard on a Christian missionary trip to England and Holland 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newcomers is Bonner Rinn, a freshman goalkeeper from Santa 
Margarita. Rinn allowed his first goals in three games Tuesday in a 2-2 
overtime tie with La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early showdown: The Concordia and Southern California College women's 
volleyball teams will meet Saturday in their second Golden State Athletic 
Conference match at Concordia. Both teams open the conference season on the 
road tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Both also are having early success. The Vanguards (9-1) are off to their best 
start in school history. Concordia is 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early rout: The Chapman football team, which will open its first season in 62 
years Saturday at Whittier, had a trial run last Friday, scrimmaging the San 
Diego junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scrimmage wasn't publicized, about 700 were on hand to watch as 
the Panthers built a 38-0 halftime lead and won, 41-7. Quarterback Curtis 
Robinson, a 6-foot-3 transfer from Citrus College, was the offensive standout. 
He gained 83 yards in five carries. He scored two touchdowns, one on a 61-yard 
run, and passed for another, a 50-yarder to wide receiver Darnell Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Alamitos standout Todd Gragnano, who will share time with Robinson 
at quarterback, completed four of 12 passes for 63 yards with one interception. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman softball Coach Lisle Lloyd is recovering from a broken neck he 
suffered late last month. Lloyd will have to wear a halo neck brace until 
December, his daughter and assistant coach Janet Lloyd said. Lisle Lloyd fell 
from a ladder while doing yard work at his North Tustin home. After the fall, 
he got up and went into his house and attended to a cut on his face and his 
knee. Hours later, he complained of stiffness, and decided to go to the 
hospital where doctors discovered a broken vertebra. "The doctor said if 100 
people fell like that, 99 would be paralyzed from the neck down," Janet Lloyd 
said. . . . Southern California College presented the ball used for Ila 
Borders' first pitch in college baseball game to the Orange County Sports Assn. 
Hall of Fame Tuesday at Anaheim Stadium. Borders also turned over her hat and 
road uniform. The paraphernalia will be used in a display the Hall of Fame 
plans to dedicate next month. . . . Chapman has hired Jim Moore as its sports 
information director. Moore replaces Derek Anderson, who took a similar job at 
Cal State Dominguez Hills this summer, and will also be an assistant women's 
basketball coach.

ORANGE DEFENSE STOPS SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange Coach Dick Hill, the winningest coach in Orange County history, enjoyed 
victory No. 197 Thursday by watching his stingy defense key the Panthers' 35-0 
triumph over Saddleback at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's defense forced three turnovers and Anthony Adame and Markus Garza 
each scored two touchdowns to lead an opportunistic offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Brian Maize capped the victory for the Panthers (1-1), by plucking 
Saddleback quarterback Brian Killingbeck's pitch in mid-air and racing 41 yards 
for the final touchdown with 3 minutes 28 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our linebackers played well," Hill said. "We feel good about how the kids 
came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor beat Orange, 28-10, in the season opener last week and three 
Newport Harbor running backs rushed for a combined 229 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday was a different story with Orange forcing six fumbles while 
keeping Saddleback out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the second quarter, linebacker Aaron Alvarado gave Orange its first 
break by intercepting a pass from Killingbeck at the Saddleback 47 and 
returning it to the 18. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Garza, who rushed for 78 yards in 12 carries, plunged over 
the left side of the line behind Adam Dodge and George Hernandez for an 18-yard 
touchdown run with 1:43 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange forced Saddleback's Omar Palacios to fumble on the Roadrunners' next 
play from scrimmage and Carlos Heard recovered for the Panthers at the 
Saddleback 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Orange quarterback Andy Lauridsen, who completed nine of 12 
passes for 97 yards, lofted a perfect 15-yard touchdown pass to Adame in the 
corner of the end zone with 33 seconds remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauridsen found Adame for a 13-yard touchdown pass with 4:41 remaining in the 
third quarter and Shawn O'Malley's conversion gave Orange a 21-0 lead. On the 
Panthers' next possession, Garza carried the ball on seven of the eight plays, 
ending the drive with a two-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunners (0-2) had their best drive early in the second quarter, moving 
75 yards in 13 plays to the Orange 10, before misfiring on a field-goal 
attempt.

DIAMOND BAR'S DIMINUTIVE RUNNING BACKS SLICE THROUGH EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>

 Terry Roche insists his Diamond Bar football team is young and will have a 
difficult time surviving the Sierra League this fall. But he might have trouble 
convincing El Dorado of that after getting stampeded by the Brahmas, 31-14, 
Thursday at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 The pocket-sized backfield of Scott Williams and Lathian Tyler helped Diamond 
Bar improve to 1-1. Neither is bigger than 5 feet 8, 160 pounds, yet they 
combined for 217 rushing and 65 passing yards. Tyler also scored twice, on runs 
of five and 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Stidham wasn't quite as brilliant at quarterback -- he completed six 
passes for 102 yards and a touchdown and an interception. But the Brahmas' 
defense harassed El Dorado starter Mike Marzicola into three interceptions and 
forced two fumbles. The five turnovers were converted into 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can be a decent team," Roche said. "We've got young kids but good 
attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado Coach Rick Jones lost more than a season opener. He was nearly 
reduced to asking for volunteers Thursday: seven players, five of them two-way 
starters, watched from the sidelines because of injuries, reducing the 
available roster to 30. During the game, the Golden Hawks lost receiver Kirk 
Badii after a 16-yard catch because of an injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second and third teams did the best they could," said Jones, who already 
called up reinforcements from the junior varsity this week. "And when you're a 
young team learning how to win, sometimes you have to be stomped in the 
process. We're young and we play like it. Right now we need some of our guys to 
step up and take some initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Stidham completed a 32-yard touchdown toss to Andrew 
Hackett, who outraced his defender down the right sideline for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado -- which suffered through a miserable half, getting more penalty 
yards (73) than offense (38) -- got an immediate lift from Richie Williams, who 
returned the ensuing kickoff 95 yards for the Golden Hawks' lone score in the 
half. But as soon as the Brahmas got the ball back, they rumbled 63 yards in 
nine plays, Jeremy Ruiz capping the drive with a touchdown from two yards.

KENNEDY POSTS UNSATISFYING VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson won't give back his 28-10 victory over Magnolia at 
Western High, but its doubtful he did much celebrating Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson agonized in the press box while watching his team make a variety of 
mental and physical mistakes. Fortunately for Olson, Magnolia made the more 
significant mistakes as it fumbled twice inside its 20 yard-line in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy (1-1) scored touchdowns off both fumbles and ran the ball effectively 
enough in the second half to manage a victory. But afterward, Olson talked like 
a loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't very satisfying," Olson said. "They took it to us. I'm not real 
happy. The way we played, we were lucky to win. We didn't play smart. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that bothers me the most is the guys that are supposed to be 
carrying us are not doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish were coming off a respectable 24-14 loss to Los Alamitos, 
and Olson said that game was still on his team's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought they were special after that game," Olson said. "We were flatter 
than a pancake. If not for their fumbles, we might have lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia, which took a 3-0 lead, lost its first fumble on a reverse by Jesse 
Blizalde at its 11. Two plays later, Charlie Marino scored the first of his 
three touchdowns from two yards out with two minutes left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy appeared ready to score again, but fullback Darrin Martineau fumbled 
on Magnolia's two. Magnolia returned the favor five plays later when running 
back Tony Iliescu fumbled on his 19. Martineau scored two plays later on a 
14-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia (1-1) scored on a 16-yard pass from Robert Nichols to Eric Webber 
with eight seconds left in the half, but it never mounted a serious drive in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino (18 rushes, 118 yards) scored on runs of two and 44 yards in a second 
half that was interrupted for 15 minutes because of a power outage that 
darkened the field lights and the scoreboard.

<P>
 Mike Williams ran for 90 yards and scored the game-winning touchdown to lead 
Marina over Corona del Mar, 22-14, Thursday night at Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina linebacker Steve Cooper recovered a fumbled snap by Corona del Mar 
quarterback Josh Walz to seal the victory with 18 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Aron Bergman intercepted a pass from Sea King quarterback Aaron Perlmutter on 
the first play from scrimmage, and the Vikings scored three plays later, on a 
10-yard run by quarterback Matt Roberson. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar pulled within one midway through the second quarter when 
running back Brian Hogan capped a 42-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run. 
The kick failed, leaving Marina with a 7-6 advantage at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina pulled away in a second half marred with turnovers. The Vikings' Tom 
Keim returned a punt that went 20 yards off the back of Walz for a 14-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After recovering an on-side kick, Williams finished a six-play, 34-yard drive 
with a one-yard touchdown run. The two-point conversion gave Marina a 22-6 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings pulled within seven when Perlmutter hit Bill Taketa for a 
42-yard touchdown, then ran in the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar had a chance to tie with under a minute left, when Walz fumbled 
the snap at midfield. JON CLIFFORD

DROUGHNSES LEAD ANAHEIM PAST LOARA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim's Robert Droughns returned the opening kickoff 87 yards and the 
Colonists went on to a 20-0 nonleague victory against Loara Thursday night at 
Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns fielded the kickoff at the 13, cut up the middle and got two blocks 
near midfield from his brother, Reuben.He outran two Loara defenders to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the game was dominated by Reuben Droughns and the Anaheim 
defensive unit. Reuben gained 102 yards in 20 carries and scored on an 11-yard 
run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the game midway through the fourth quarter after suffering a minor 
knee bruise while making a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim's defense, meanwhile, held Loara to 47 yards rushing, and 131 yards 
overall. The Colonists' defense has given up 14 points in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The defense) did a good job for us," Anaheim Coach Allen Carter. "We still 
have a lot of work to do, but I believe we are getting better. Irvine (next 
week's opponent) is tough. I don't know how we're going to survive that game." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim (2-0) capped the scoring in the third quarter on a 33-yard touchdown 
pass from Rudy Herrera to Travis Pena. Herrera completed five of nine passes 
for 59 yards. Pena caught four passes for 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kirkland completed eight of 23 passes for 84 yards and one interception 
for Loara (0-2). GABE LACQUES

PACIFICA RELIES ON SUMMERS TO BEAT OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacifica relied on the running and durability of senior Tommy Summers to 
control the clock in its 17-7 victory over Huntington Beach Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team managed much offense, with Pacifica (1-1) totaling 139 yards and 
the Oilers 98.However, Summers, a 5-foot-8, 170-pound senior, came through with 
the key plays for the Mariners. Although he had only two carries for more than 
10 yards, he accounted for six of nine Mariner first downs and was key in their 
only extended scoring drive.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners took the lead on their first possession, after recovering an 
Oiler fumble on the Huntington Beach 14. Three plays later, Craig Chow 
connected on a 23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Huffmire recovered another Oiler fumble at the Mariner 37 early in the 
second quarter, and Pacifica marched 63 yards, taking a 10-0 lead on a two-yard 
run by Paul Toepel. They extended that lead when Rudy Gonzales ran back the 
second-half kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown and a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach, which had a touchdown negated in the first quarter because 
of an inadvertent whistle, got on the board with 8:05 left as Brenton Wood 
punched in from two yards. The Oilers, who went 13-1 last season, are 0-2 on 
the young season. ERIC MADDY

a 28-0 victory over Azusa Thursday night at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>

third quarter to give the Trojans a 28-0 lead.

interception. But Azusa (0-2), which has not scored in two games, had three

senior fullback Ray Davis with 4:46 left in the second quarter.

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY ROUNDUP; ESPERANZA GIRLS END EDISON'S DUAL-MEET WINNING 
STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Esperanza girls' cross-country team celebrated its entry to the Sunset 
League by beating host Edison Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by a 1-2 finish from seniors Courtney Pugmire and Carrie Caulkins, the 
Aztecs (1-0, 1-0 in league) ended the Chargers' six-year dual-meet winning 
streak with a 24-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory strengthened Esperanza's No. 1 county ranking; the Aztecs and 
Chargers were the top two ranked teams in the preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire assumed the lead shortly after the one-mile mark of the three-mile 
race, easing to victory in 18 minutes 19 seconds. Caulkins (18:42) pulled away 
from Edison's Jennifer Formosa (19:01) in the final mile to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory stretched the Aztecs' winning streak to just over three years. A 
1991 Empire League loss to Los Alamitos was the last blemish on Esperanza's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach and I decided I needed to run my own race, at my own pace," Pugmire 
said. "And I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's Keri Wright assumed the early lead, taking the race through the first 
mile before Pugmire took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the girls before the start of the race that's what they should 
expect," Esperanza Coach Rich Medellin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright finished fourth (19:05), followed closely by Aztec senior Jenny Titus 
(19:26) and Charger senior Jeannie Formosa (19:30). 
</P>
<P>
 The victory avenged the Aztecs' loss to the Chargers at the Orange County 
Championships last October, where the teams tied, but Edison won because of a 
faster sixth runner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, our focus was a lot on the other teams," Medellin said. "This 
year, our focus is on ourselves." MATT FARMER

TROY'S GROUND GAME ABLE TO BURY GARDEN GROVE, 23-6

 Larry Montgomery spearheaded a Troy ground attack that gained 266 yards to 
lead the visiting Warriors to a 23-6 victory over Garden Grove in a nonleague 
game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery carried the ball 24 times for 199 yards, 139 in the second 
half.About the only thing Montgomery did not do was get into the end zone; He 
left that to backfield mate Ryl Relatores, who scored on two short-yardage 
bursts in the second half for the Warriors (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove struck first with a 55-yard drive on the game's first series, 
capped by a three-yard run by Ruben Reyna. It was a downhill ride the rest of 
the night for the Argonauts (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Troy took the lead for good with 9 minutes 14 seconds remaining in the second 
quarter, when Kevin Gray connected with wide-open Frank Pacheco for a 38-yard 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors put away the game in the third quarter. The defense ended Garden 
Grove's first drive of the half after three plays and as many yards, turning 
the ball over to Montgomery and the offense. Montgomery responded with a 
73-yard drive -- including runs of 28 and 33 yards -- on the ensuing possession 
that culminated with Relatores' first score from two yards out. AHMED V. ORTIZ

quarter, propelling La Canada High to a 14-12 nonleague victory over Glendale 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee took the pass from James Wolstenholme and broke three tackles up the left

 Only two weeks into the season and the Littlerock High football team is 
already living on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Johnson's 18-yard touchdown pass to Hoa Le with 39 seconds remaining 
Thursday lifted the Lobos to a 12-10 nonleague victory over Oxnard at Palmdale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Littlerock (1-0-1) escaped with a 14-14 tie against Serrano when 
the Lobo defense recovered a fumble at its goal line with 33 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the Lobos again capitalized on a turnover late in the game to beat 
Oxnard (0-2). Mike Stewart recovered a fumble at the Lobos' 36 with three 
minutes remaining. Johnson then directed a 64-yard scoring drive that was kept 
alive by three converted fourth downs. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half, Littlerock's Lafayette Bailey returned the 
kickoff 93 yards.

HE'S NOT FIERY BUT GUTIERREZ STOKES AZTECS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER SANTA 
CLARA HIGH QUARTERBACK ERASES TOLLNER'S DOUBTS, LEADS SAN DIEGO STATE TO A 2-0 
START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The relationship between quarterback Tim Gutierrez and new Coach Ted Tollner, 
two men charged with bolstering an underachieving football program at San Diego 
State, got off to a shaky start. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was upset when San Diego State fired Coach Al Luginbill last year 
and was apprehensive when Ted Tollner was hired to replace him. Tollner didn't 
think Gutierrez had enough spark to lead his new no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is on solid ground now, and so, apparently, are the Aztecs. 
With Tollner and staff flashing signals from the sidelines, Gutierrez, 23, led 
San Diego State to a 22-20 victory over Cal last week. It was the Aztecs' first 
victory over a Pacific 10 Conference opponent in 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Santa Clara High standout led the Aztecs on a nine-play, 65-yard 
drive to set up the game-winning, 32-yard field goal by Antelope Valley's Peter 
Holt with 3 minutes 22 seconds left. The 40,922 fans at Jack Murphy Stadium 
cheered away years of frustration, and San Diego State is 2-0 heading into a 
game Saturday at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs have come a long way in a short time. So have Gutierrez and 
Tollner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know (Tollner) in the past," Gutierrez said of the long-time NFL 
assistant who was head coach at USC from 1983 to 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want the old coaching staff to go. I guess I was being selfish in 
thinking like that. But I didn't want to have to prove myself all over again to 
a new coaching staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound senior, had to prove himself to Tollner, 
despite passing for 3,033 yards and 24 touchdowns after replacing injured David 
Lowery in the third game of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how to read (Gutierrez)," Tollner said. "Is he excited about 
being a football player or is he not? I was initially concerned if he'd be able 
to do what we want him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollner was looking for someone to lead a full-throttle, no-huddle, 
run-and-shoot offense. He was concerned about the quiet, almost-docile demeanor 
of Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 "My early read was a quiet indifference," Tollner said. "But, really, it was a 
composed confidence. The more we asked of him in spring ball, the more he 
responded. From what I've seen, the closer it gets to the game, his composure 
becomes more and more of a strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez gunned down Cal, completing 25 of 43 passes for 314 yards and two 
touchdowns in the come-from-behind victory. The Bears beat the Aztecs, 45-25, 
last season, and were coming off a 37-3 rout of Iowa in the 1993 Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollner had nobody else to turn to. Marshall Faulk was taken in the first 
round and receiver Darnay Scott in the second round of the NFL draft.  
</P>
<P>
 Both would have been seniors this fall. Ten other players signed free-agent 
contracts, leaving Tollner with few returning skill players and no starters on 
the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez has responded with six touchdown passes and only one interception. 
His quarterback rating (163.2) is 10th-best nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollner credits Gutierrez for his composure and his ability to read defenses 
quickly. He also likes his accuracy, quick release and sense of when to throw 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have a lot of foot speed," Tollner said. "He's not going to 
scramble and make any big, giant runs. But that doesn't matter if you can do 
these other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez has appeared in only 15 games for the Aztecs -- starting 11 -- but 
he has passed for 3,727 yards and 31 touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 With 14 more touchdown passes, Gutierrez would pass Brian Sipe and Dan McGwire 
in the school record book and move into third place behind Todd Santos (70) and 
Dennis Shaw (58). 
</P>
<P>
 His personal goals are much loftier. Gutierrez wants to complete 70% of his 
passes (he's at 67.6%) and pass 5,000 yards -- a feat accomplished only by 
Houston's David Klingler and Brigham Young's Ty Detmer in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might laugh, because that's a high goal," said Gutierrez, who threw for 
7,272 career yards (third highest in Southern Sections history) at Santa Clara. 
"But in order for us to reach the next level, you've got to set your goals 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory over Cal was a good starting point. San Diego State had not beaten 
a Pac-10 opponent in 17 tries dating to 1985. But "the next level" has eluded 
the Aztecs since they jumped to Division I in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was to establish San Diego State as perennial Western Athletic 
Conference champion. Sixteen years later, the Aztecs are still trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos, who became the nation's career passing leader in 1988, and Faulk, the 
top running back in college football in 1991, could not lead the Aztecs out of 
mediocrity.  
</P>
<P>
 With San Diego State capturing only one conference championship and two bowl 
berths since 1978, the fans still dream of the Aztecs' glory years in Division 
I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 12-season span from 1966-77, San Diego State compiled a 111-17-3 
record. Playing an independent schedule three of those seasons, the Aztecs 
captured championships in eight of the other nine: two in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. and five in the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But from 1978-93, San Diego State was 87-94-6, having won only one 
championship despite sending 47 players to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take this team by the horns and take them to the next level," 
Gutierrez said. "As a quarterback, that's what you're supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said his disappointment over Luginbill's firing was erased when he 
met Tollner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tollner's respect was earned right when he stepped through the door," 
Gutierrez said. "I see an excitement in his face. He wants to go out there and 
win. Guys who didn't want to practice in the past are excited about practicing 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "This new coaching staff is experienced. I think they could take us over the 
hump that we've been trying to get over." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez defended Luginbill, but he admits he got tired of Luginbill's 
constant nervous pacing on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in the back of our heads that our coach was walking around frantic," 
Gutierrez said. "You would see it on TV and think, 'God. What's the whole 
country looking at?' " 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State's new gun-slinging, no-huddle assault could also be described 
as frantic. But Gutierrez likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really just a 60-minute, two-minute drill," he said. "I think I work 
better with tempo. It's my style of play. I couldn't have come into a better 
situation."

SIDELINES; VALLEY COLLEGE BASEBALL TEAM SWEETLY TRADES VERDICTS FOR CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penny-pinching college athletic programs take note: the Valley College 
baseball team has come up with a unique fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 About twice a month, a group of about 40 players, coaches and friends are paid 
members of the studio audience at tapings of "Jones & Jury," a half-hour 
courtroom show that airs weekdays on KCAL-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Each member of the audience receives $15 to sit through two tapings. And they 
have an active role in the show because they determine the verdict by vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Beats peddling candy door-to-door. Monarch Coach Chris Johnson said the 
baseball program is about $1,200 better for the effort. "All the kids have to 
do is show up," he said. "You just hate to have to make the kids be salesmen 
all the time. This is a great thing." 
</P>

 Special dedications: The football teams from Channel Islands and Village 
Christian high schools are playing with extra emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands dedicated its 20-7 victory over Rio Mesa last week to Junior 
Tuimoloau, the team's defensive coordinator. Tuimoloau had open-heart surgery 
just before summer conditioning drills started last month. He is expected to be 
watching from the bleachers tonight when the Raiders play host to Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "He means so much to the kids and they really care about him," Channel Islands 
Coach Joel Gershon said. "They want to do good things for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian has dedicated its season to Orializ Santos, whose father, 
Hector, is in charge of field maintenance at the school. Orializ, 17, recently 
was diagnosed with bone cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team found out, got together after practice, and decided they wanted to 
do something for her," Village Christian Coach Mike Plaisance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family feuds: Tonight's football game between Sylmar and Chatsworth highs has 
at least two families with torn allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Dan and Donna Wyatt will be in attendance, but they won't be 
sharing any cheers. Dan is an assistant principal at Sylmar, Donna an assistant 
principal at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicting dynamics also will be in evidence on the field. Darryl McIntyre, a 
Sylmar assistant coach, will be suppressing his enthusiasm for the efforts of 
his nephew, Antonio McIntyre, a Chatsworth running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor has it that the Sylmar defense has gleaned inspiration from the younger 
McIntyre's presence in their opponent's backfield. "Yeah, because they hate me 
so much, they say they're gonna get him," Darryl McIntyre said. "But, it's all 
in good fun." Update 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke and Brandy Page, twins and standout distance runners for North 
Hollywood High last spring, have transferred to Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair placed first and second in the 1,600 and 3,200 meters in the Valley 
Pac-8 Conference track-and-field finals in May. Brooke followed that with a 
fourth-place finish in the 3,200 in the City Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Stats  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Missy Clements is averaging 4.9 kills per game for the Cal State Northridge 
women's volleyball team, a pace that would shatter the single-season record of 
4.20 set last year by her teammate, Aimee Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack of pushovers: The combined 1993 record of Northridge's 10 football 
opponents this fall is 47-54-3. Factor out UC Davis, which was 10-2 last year, 
and the record falls to 37-52-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure-hands person: Marcos Solorzano's 10 catches last week against Taft High 
was the most in a game by a Crespi receiver since Ryan Kieling caught 12 in 
1990. The school record is 19, held by Mike Brady in 1974. Honors  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Valley College quarterback Jim Arellanes and wide receiver Brian Comer, along 
with running back George Jones of Bakersfield, were selected offensive 
tri-players of the week in the Western State Conference. Ventura defensive back 
Noah Walsh and Glendale linebacker Victor Huezo were defensive co-players of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona, completed 28 of 40 passes for 402 
yards and three touchdowns in a 41-24 interdivisional victory Saturday over 
Santa Barbara. Comer, a sophomore from Chatsworth High, had 12 receptions for 
194 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, a freshman from Ventura High, intercepted two passes to help the 
Pirates to a 38-0 interdivisional victory over West L.A., snapping an 11-game 
losing streak. Huezo, a freshman from Crescenta Valley High, had 10 tackles and 
three sacks and recovered a fumble in a 28-26 nonconference victory over 
Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrice as nice: Keith West's hat trick -- three goals -- in a men's soccer 
match against Loyola Marymount last Sunday earned the Cal State Northridge 
junior Mountain Pacific Sports Federation co-player of the week honors. West, 
who also had an assist in the Matadors' 4-1 victory, shared the award with 
Jamel Mitchell of Cal State Sacramento. Things to Do

TRUSTEE CRITICIZED FOR IMMIGRATION REMARKS; OXNARD: AUDIENCE MEMBERS ARGUE WITH 
JACK T. FOWLER OVER SPEECH HE MADE ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S NEED FOR A 'DOMINANT 
CULTURE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A speech advocating the country's need to maintain a "dominant culture" by an 
Oxnard elementary school trustee triggered a heated argument with members of a 
largely Latino audience at a school board meeting Wednesday night -- with one 
resident comparing the trustee to Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Jack T. Fowler and three Oxnard residents exchanged nasty remarks for 
nearly 45 minutes after the residents asked the Oxnard School District board to 
oppose Proposition 187, which, if passed, would deny most government services 
including education to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 After other members of the school board expressed their opposition to the 
ballot measure, Fowler said he wanted to speak in support of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly support Proposition 187," he said. "People entering this country 
illegally in small groups does not hurt. But the flood of people we have had in 
the last two decades has caused a lot of trouble. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Any political entity such as a country or state, has to have a dominant 
culture. If we don't, we will have one culture vying to dominate the other," 
Fowler said during a 20-minute speech. "It's foolish to believe in the concept 
of multiculturalism."  
</P>
<P>
 Nina Duarte, 40, who moved from Mexico to Oxnard with her parents when she 9 
years old, called Fowler racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your opinions, Mr. Fowler, are reminiscent of those held by Hitler," Duarte 
said. "What is it that makes you or your race superior to me or my race?"  
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the heated confrontation, Fowler said the audience had 
misunderstood him and for more than four minutes he fiercely repeated, "Back 
away from the lie lady, back away from the lie lady. . . ," as a resident 
spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the board voted 4 to 1 to oppose Proposition 187, with Fowler 
casting the one vote in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's debate came a week after El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, a 
nonprofit Latino rights group, asked the district to oppose the initiative. If 
passed, Proposition 187, which will be on the November ballot, would not allow 
illegal immigrants, including children, to attend public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of illegal immigrants who attend classes in the Oxnard 
School District is unknown, about 80% of the district's 13,000-student 
enrollment is Latino. Of that group, 47% speak English as a second language, 
district figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Mary Barreto, a Latina, said she walked out of the meeting while 
Fowler spoke because she was outraged by his lack of respect for humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Fowler continues to feel the way he does, I don't think he should have 
anything to do with our children," Barreto said in an interview Thursday. "He 
should leave (the board) because he is in the wrong place."  
</P>
<P>
 Other board members said they found Fowler's behavior out of line. They said 
that he damaged the district's reputation by the way he expressed his views.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad that Mr. Fowler lost control," said trustee Susan Alvarez. "What 
he said had nothing to do with education and he was speaking for himself, not 
for the board or the district's administration."  
</P>
<P>
 Board President James Suter said he was criticized for not stopping Fowler 
during Fowler's attack on illegal immigrants, but Suter said that trustees, 
unlike residents who only have three minutes to speak to the board, can talk 
for as long as they want.  
</P>
<P>
 Defending himself in an interview on Thursday, Fowler said he is not against 
immigration, but he opposes it when it is out of control.  
</P>
<P>
 "Immigration from any part of the world in controlled amounts enriches our 
culture," Fowler said. "But the flow of illegal immigrants that we have had in 
the last decade is violent and sudden, and it's causing extreme disruption to 
the fabric of our society."  
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said he does not like to see children suffer -- particularly when their 
parents are at fault. But where immigration is concerned, the law has to apply 
to everyone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody is comfortable in throwing a child out of school," 
Fowler said. "But the law cannot be selective. (Proposition 187) will make a 
statement that a free ride in education or any other social services no longer 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Duarte said she and her husband removed three of 
their children from the Oxnard School District last year and enrolled them in 
private school because of people like Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's criminal for him to be representing schoolchildren, particularly in 
Oxnard where most people are Latinos," Duarte said. "He is in the wrong 
country, he is in the wrong city and he is in the wrong decade. The United 
States is a country of immigrants and no one can change that."

SYMPHONY GIVEN TUESDAY DEADLINE TO SIGN CONTRACT; CONCERT: SEASON OPENER IN 
OCTOBER WILL BE CANCELED IF MUSICIANS DO NOT AGREE TO SHORT-TERM AGREEMENT THAT 
PROHIBITS STRIKE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony will cancel its first performance of the season 
unless the orchestra's musicians ratify a short-term contract prohibiting them 
from going on strike, symphony directors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony President Felice Ginsberg said the musicians have until Tuesday to 
sign the interim agreement, which would extend through mid-January and freeze 
musicians' wages at last year's levels. If the agreement is not signed, she 
said, the Oct. 8 concert at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium will be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimatum comes a week after both sides declared contract negotiations -- 
the first in the symphony's 30-year history -- at a standstill. Union 
negotiators and symphony leaders said Thursday they are nowhere near reaching 
accord on key issues, including tenure and the right to dismiss a musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg said the symphony's Board of Directors agreed unanimously Wednesday 
to offer the short-term contract as a way of avoiding a last-minute strike by 
musicians. Since negotiations began in mid-July, symphony managers threatened 
to cancel all or part of the season if an agreement is not reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair to our subscribers to say, 'We don't know if we're going to go 
forward or have a strike,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Thiroux, a bassoonist and member of the musicians' negotiating 
committee, said he had not yet seen a copy of the agreement. But he added: "I 
suppose any movement is encouraging. If this gets us talking, that's positive." 
</P>
<P>
 "We still want to play, but we want our goals that we've stated before," he 
said. In addition to tenure, local representatives of the American Federation 
of Musicians are seeking a peer-review process and wages closer to union scale 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no new negotiating sessions scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
 Thiroux said the symphony's 60 or so musicians have not formally discussed the 
possibility of a strike. And many of the musicians, he said, have made verbal 
agreements to play in the first concert when called by a representative for the 
symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg said the symphony's managers need a response from the union by 
Tuesday to allow time to notify subscribers if the concert is canceled. Rather 
than refunding money, the symphony would most likely schedule an additional 
concert at the end of the season, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If no agreement is reached and the symphony is forced to cancel its entire 
season, Ginsberg said, the orchestra may not recover. The symphony began this 
season with an $80,000 deficit, the largest in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If in fact we have to cancel the season, then there won't be a symphony," she 
said.

WAR CHEST GROWS IN BID TO KEEP BASES OPEN; MILITARY: A TASK FORCE'S 
FUND-RAISING EFFORTS TO KEEP TWO NAVY FACILITIES IN THE COUNTY OPEN GET A BOOST 
FROM THREE AREA CITIES.

 Pledges of financial support this week from west Ventura County's three 
largest cities have dramatically increased the momentum of the battle to block 
possible closure of the county's U.S. Navy bases, organizers leading the fight 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wednesday's pledge of $19,530 from the Camarillo City Council, the 
Ventura County BRAC '95 Task Force has received more than $120,000 in pledges 
from three cities, the county and individuals, said Cal Carrera, co-chairman of 
the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing is really starting to snowball," Carrera said. "I think people in 
the county are finally starting to realize what a threat to the county a base 
closure represents." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force's goal is to raise $350,000, Carrera said. That money will be 
used to pay for the services of a Washington lobbying firm and possibly hiring 
a task force executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 While Port Hueneme turned down the group's request for financial assistance 
last week, representatives of the task force say they are encouraged by their 
success in Ventura, which gave $19,930, and Oxnard, which will contribute 
$32,450. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force next week will ask for contributions from Simi Valley, Thousand 
Oaks and Moorpark at city council meetings in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Santa Paula, Fillmore and Ojai will also soon be approached for 
funds by the task force, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors made the first contribution to the campaign 
late last month, pledging $10,000, office space and staff time to help complete 
a contract between the task force and the lobbying firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, task force officials warned Camarillo officials that they may 
return to all the contributing cities for additional funds should either the 
Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme or the Point Mugu Naval Air 
Weapons Station wind up on the Base Realignment and Closure list. Federal 
officials are scheduled to release the list March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's admittedly late in the game," Carrera said of the timing of the lobbying 
effort. "But, we believe that our (campaign) budget is valid as long as we stay 
off the closure list. If we get on the list, we'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said he supported making the pledge to the task force, but 
cautioned that the campaign might not be enough to save the bases from closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do the best we can but there's some possibility we may not be 
successful," Gose said. "We have to understand what tremendous competition 
there is among these bases to stay open." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 50 Ventura County-based defense industry leaders met Thursday 
at a luncheon in Camarillo to discuss ways of coping with the Pentagon's 
continuing efforts to downsize military forces -- a directive that has caused 
the loss of an estimated 7,000 defense-related jobs in the county during the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Henton, a manager of the Silicon Valley Network, a consortium of 
Northern California business and defense executives, said Ventura County 
defense executives should prepare for possible base closures and shrinking 
defense contracts similar to those that have occurred in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to start thinking about the development of 'dual-use' 
technologies," Henton said. "These are products that are in demand for defense 
and civilian commercial markets and which will help ensure your survival." 
</P>
<P>
 Henton said one technique defense contractors can use is to join together in 
the development of technologies in so-called industry clusters, with groups of 
competing companies sharing resources and working together on product 
development.

ENROLLMENT AT COUNTY SCHOOLS RISING; EDUCATION: VENTURA UNIFIED DISTRICT GETS 
400 MORE STUDENTS THAN EXPECTED. OFFICIALS RUSH TO HIRE MORE TEACHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Enrollment in many Ventura County school districts has increased this fall, 
catching some administrators off guard as they scramble to hire part-time 
teachers for the overflow of students. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in Camarillo, Ojai, Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and 
Oxnard all report enrollment increases this year, ranging from a few dozen 
additional students to several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest boom, however, has occurred in the Ventura Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year decline in enrollment, the district was flooded with 400 more 
students than expected on the first day of class. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura administrators had projected that 11,800 students in kindergarten 
through the 12th grade would begin classes when schools on a traditional 
calendar reopened last week. Instead, 12,200 showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, teachers on some secondary-level campuses are faced with up to 41 
students in academic classes and up to 49 students for physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very cooperative, it's just that I have to move so fast," said Balboa 
Middle School teacher Barbara Morris, who taught a finger-painting project to 
39 sixth-graders on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know when they leave here," she said, "I'm going to flop down someplace and 
be exhausted for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials have already begun interviewing for two new teaching 
positions at Portola School, which has 60 more children than expected, and one 
new instructor for Will Rogers School, where enrollment is 33 above 
projections. They expect to hire within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Portola Principal Phyllis Robertson said 28 of her new students formerly 
attended private school. Most of the rest, she said, moved here from out of 
state or transferred from other schools in the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
 Other principals are reporting that many new students live in apartments. And 
school officials think that some of the children's families lived in the San 
Fernando Valley before the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be getting some of the overflow from the Valley because so many 
apartments are uninhabitable," said Georgeann Brown, district director of 
budget and finance. 
</P>
<P>
 In other local cities, the higher enrollments came as less of a surprise. 
Officials in Thousand Oaks, Ojai and Oxnard had all predicted slight increases 
based on census data, new home sales and the previous year's class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, the Oxnard Elementary School District counted 13,145 students, 
up from 12,880 at the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrator Kathy Cooper said the district typically enrolls 300 to 400 new 
students each year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, enrollment in the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
stood at close to 17,600 this week, about 200 more students than last year. To 
handle the increase, temporary teachers will be hired at two elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been pretty steady for the last couple of years, but now we're going to 
edge back up a couple hundred," Supt. Jerry Gross said. "We think that housing 
sales have picked up." 
</P>
<P>
 And in Oak Park, enrollment in the county's smallest district has crept up to 
2,739, about 75 students above projections and 200 above last year's roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are being attracted by the school district and we've got more 
move-ins," Assistant Supt. Stan Mantooth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley is the only district with a sharp drop in enrollment. About 360 
fewer students showed up for class than last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators with the Simi Valley Unified School District blame the decline 
on a loss of local jobs, particularly in aerospace, and the displacement of 
many families because of earthquake damage to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Gaudioso, principal of Valley View Junior High, said almost all schools 
with substantial drops are in the city's east end, where earthquake damage was 
heaviest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of apartments and mobile homes that were severely damaged," 
he said. "People who were renting really had no ties to the community and so 
they moved out."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; WOMAN KILLED AFTER HER CAR HITS TRAILER 
</P>

<P>
 A 42-year-old Oxnard woman died Thursday when she slammed her car into the 
back of a trailer loaded with scores of irrigation pipes, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Isabel Rosales was following a pickup truck driven by Juventino 
Lopez, 64, of Oxnard across the Santa Clara River bridge on Victoria Avenue 
near Ventura when she hit the truck's trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just kept going straight into the back of the truck," said Rick Landof, a 
Port Hueneme research analyst who saw the collision. "She didn't try to stop. 
She didn't hit the brakes, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Landof's father, Bill Landof of Oxnard, said he ran to the car and tried to 
save the woman. "I tried to get a pulse on her neck and her arm, but there was 
no pulse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two red markers hung from separate pipes at the end of the trailer, warning 
drivers that it was moving slowly. A small brown teddy bear lay across the back 
of Rosales' car amid a sheet of crushed glass. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else was in the car with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the impact, Lopez's vehicle dragged the car several hundred feet until 
witnesses got him to stop, CHP Sgt. Don Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unaware he had even been rear-ended," said Hatch, who said preliminary 
investigations suggested that Lopez was not at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Officer Curt Rhyne was the first official to arrive at the scene of the 
4:10 p.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the sun blinded her, maybe she didn't have any (sun) glasses on," Rhyne 
said. "But there were no skid marks." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was driving a truck owned by the Seaview Growers of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been hauling a load of 3-inch irrigation pipes south on Victoria Avenue 
at about 30 m.p.h. when Rosales crashed into his vehicle at about 45 m.p.h., 
Hatch said. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS OPENING POSTPONED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard High School students and teachers who have been anticipating a move to 
the school's new campus on Gonzales Road early next year will have to wait 
until summer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of delays in completing the new school's performing arts building, 
Oxnard Union High School District officials have postponed opening the campus 
until the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The gleaming $40-million campus, situated just south of Victoria Avenue, will 
replace the dilapidated 43-year-old school on 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials had initially hoped that Oxnard High's teachers and 2,200 
students could move shortly after Christmas vacation, during the short break 
between first and second semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Then construction delays pushed the completion date to February, and officials 
promised that the school could open during spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a school board meeting Wednesday, Assistant Supt. Bob Brown announced 
that the school's performing arts building will not be complete until June. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school's other buildings will be finished by the end of February, 
Brown said moving onto the campus before it was complete would force school 
officials to test all campus electrical and alarm systems twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard High Principal Daisy Tatum told the board that some of the teachers 
were disappointed about the postponement. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she will try to soften the blow to students by giving seniors the 
option to hold their graduation ceremony at the new school's stadium in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have a wonderful opportunity," Tatum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can be either the very last class to graduate from the old school or the 
very first class to graduate from the new. It's up to them." MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 2 AREAS TARGETED FOR CLEANUP DAY

<P>
 Thousand Oaks residents will have two opportunities to do a little fall 
cleaning on Saturday: They can pick up litter from a creek bed, or clear excess 
brush from a rugged trail. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the California Coastal Commission's Beach Clean-Up Day, volunteers 
will be picking up trash along Arroyo Conejo Creek in Newbury Park, a habitat 
for fish, frogs, skunks and raccoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers should meet at 9 a.m. in the parking lot just north of the tennis 
courts at Borchard Park, 190 N. Reino Road. They should wear old clothes and 
sturdy shoes and bring gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who prefer the mountains to the creeks can go to the Lyndmere trail head 
off Janss Road in Thousand Oaks at 8 a.m. Saturday to help volunteers clear the 
hiking paths. Experts will be on hand to train people how to clear brush, in 
preparation for the city's official open space maintenance day Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful chance to get some fresh air, get some exercise, see what 
the trails actually look like and provide some valuable public service," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 'MISLEADING' SMOKING PROPOSAL CONDEMNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying a statewide smoking initiative backed by a cigarette maker was 
misleading and would serve to nullify local smoking ordinances, the Camarillo 
City Council has approved a resolution condemning the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 Wednesday to oppose Proposition 188, an initiative 
backed by tobacco giant Philip Morris.The proposal would allow business owners 
to decide for themselves whether to permit smoking on their premises, 
preempting state and local ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this proposition passes, it would make our ordinance useless and wouldn't 
allow us to re-pass another one," Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said. "This is 
very misleading and I hope the voters will see through their scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Smith, who opposed the city's smoking ordinance approved 
earlier this year on constitutional grounds, cast the only dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resolution has no legal authority, it makes Camarillo the first 
local government in the county to publicly oppose the proposition. Ventura 
County officials said earlier this week that they will ask the Board of 
Supervisors next month to consider a similar resolution against the initiative.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN'S TRIAL BEGINS IN MOTHER'S DAY KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A prosecutor contended Thursday that an Oxnard man intentionally shot and 
killed his ex-girlfriend at her home on Mother's Day and should be convicted of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But during an opening statement in Gary Michael Rose's murder trial,Rose's 
defense attorney called the shooting "an act of desperate passion" and urged 
the jury to convict his client of no more than voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of first-degree murder, the 25-year-old Rose would receive a 
mandatory prison sentence of 25 years to life. If convicted of the lesser 
charge of voluntary manslaughter, he could receive as few as three years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn and Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily 
agreed that Rose became enraged with Victoria Ramey, 31, during an argument 
that took place in Ramey's La Canada Avenue home shortly before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Both attorneys told the jury that Rose went to an upstairs bedroom in the 
two-story home and assembled a .45-caliber handgun after the argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said that Rose intended to kill her from the time he retrieved the gun. 
He said Rose pushed Ramey down some stairs and then shot her three times -- 
twice in the head and once in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily, however, said Ramey had a 0.12% blood alcohol level -- which is 1 1/2 
times the legal limit for driving. He said Ramey was shot after provoking his 
client. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; 2 SAILORS INJURED IN ANTENNA COLLAPSE 
</P>

 Two sailors working on a military communications antenna at the Port Hueneme 
Seabee base were critically injured when the structure collapsed Thursday and 
they fell about five stories to the ground, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two enlisted men, both petty officers, were doing maintenance work on the 
antenna when it collapsed about 9 a.m. at the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center, spokeswoman Doris Lance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said they did not know what caused the collapse of the antenna, 
a free-standing, 80- to 100-foot tower.  
</P>
<P>
 Timothy MacTavish, 27, a steelworker 3rd class, was undergoing extensive 
surgery after suffering compound fractures in both legs and a spinal cord 
injury, a spokeswoman at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard said 
Thursday night. He was listed in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in critical condition at the same hospital was Richard Terry, 22, an 
electronic technician, 3rd class, Lance said. Gold Coast Ambulance paramedic 
Jeff Muzzin said Terry suffered severe facial and head injuries, and a hospital 
spokeswomen said he remained in intensive care Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, MacTavish was about 60 feet up the antenna and Terry 
about 50 feet when it began to fall, Muzzin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said both attempted to push off and that MacTavish landed on his feet, 
causing his fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the tower) had fallen on those guys, they wouldn't be here," Muzzin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The antenna, Lance said, is part of the Military Affiliated Radio System that 
is used to provide emergency radio links during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it also is used for "MARSGRAMS," communications between sailors and 
other naval personnel and their families. GREG RIPPEE

BICKERING THROWS A CURVE AT GENDER BALLGAME; THOUSAND OAKS: DISAGREEMENT OVER 
KEY ISSUES CANCELS MATCH BETWEEN CHAMPIONSHIP BOYS' AND GIRLS' TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Much like the baseball season itself, a proposal to pit championship Conejo 
Valley ball teams in a gender grudge match has struck out because of bickering 
over key issues, organizers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen-year-old boys on the Thousand Oaks Junior League team wanted to play 
baseball. But their 12- to 15-year-old opponents on a Newbury Park girls 
softball team insisted that a softball be used, said Joseph Joyce, president of 
the girl's Bobby Sox Softball League. 
</P>
<P>
 "In baseball, a hardball is used and it travels faster than a softball," Joyce 
said. "Our girls aren't used to that." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys had their own concerns, said Brian Angel, a Westlake Village radio 
station producer who helped hype the boys versus girls skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys have no experience hitting a ball thrown by an underhand pitcher," 
Angel said. "And the boys could hurt their arms throwing a softball. It 
involves a completely different weight distribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the question of who would pay for such necessities as insurance left 
players backing away from the faceoff faster than a line drive to third. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the game is off, the spate of media attention given the match has 
raised the public's awareness of inequities in the way boys and girls sports 
are covered, said Stacie Beshore, a star pitcher on the softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this will make some people realize that girls can play sports just as 
well as boys," said Stacie, 15, a sophomore at Newbury Park High School. "But I 
think it will take a long time for things to be equal." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge by softball catcher Amanda Marino to take on the boys' team came 
after the girls won a national title for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Coverage of the girls' victory was scant contrasted with the flurry of news 
stories written about the boys as they advanced toward victory in their Junior 
League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda, like other softball players and their parents, was so peeved by the 
disparity that she challenged the boys to a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd beat them because we're tougher," Amanda proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those words split Conejo Valley sports fans along gender lines, as talk began 
circulating about a possible battle of the sexes. But when radio producer Angel 
had the presidents of both leagues on his show to discuss the competition, it 
was agreed the decision would be left up to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when the idea died, Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls wanted to play a game for fun," he said. "When it looked like it 
was turning into a grudge match, they decided to call it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel and others, however, agreed that the girls' team is receiving more 
recognition for their athletic ability as a result of the proposed faceoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been national champions three times in a row," Angel said. "And who 
knew about them until this year?" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being featured in several news articles about the possible game, the 
girls will receive recognition for the first time by the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District, Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Sept. 27, the softball team will be honored by the Thousand Oaks City 
Council, Joyce said. Councilman Frank Schillo is arranging a pep rally to start 
at 4 p.m. at Borchard Park in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the rally, the girls will be driven in limousines to the council's 
new chambers in the Civic Arts Plaza for an awards ceremony, Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done an astounding job," he said. "They are national champions and 
they deserve the recognition."

EX-NURSE DENIES 3 MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former nurse at St. John's Regional Medical Center pleaded not guilty 
Thursday to three counts of sexual battery on patients while they were sedated. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorden Butikofer, 37, appeared calm and chatted with his attorney as he waited 
for Thursday's arraignment before Ventura County Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis 
III. 
</P>
<P>
 While a registered nurse at the Oxnard hospital between January, 1993, and 
this May, Butikofer fondled three Ventura County men who were receiving 
treatment, authorities said. Each alleged victim was in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis lowered Butikofer's bail from $25,000 to $10,000. Prosecutors did not 
object to the bail reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Calvert said all three victims will testify 
against Butikofer during a preliminary hearing Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials said that Butikofer lives in Utah. He has no criminal history, 
they said. Butikofer was arrested by Oxnard police at Los Angeles International 
Airport on Tuesday night, when he arrived to catch a plane to Mexico with some 
St. John's hospital employees.

SCHAEFER MAKES A NAME FOR HERSELF AT NEW PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: FORMER 
COUNCILWOMAN IS LEFT OFF LIST OF 'OUTSTANDING CITIZENS,' BUT SHE'LL BE HONORED 
LATER THIS FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Madge L. Schaefer felt snubbed. Ignored. 
Even mocked. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been left off a list of "outstanding citizens" recognized by Mayor 
Alex Fiore during the first City Council meeting in the new Civic Arts Plaza 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And no list of outstanding citizens, she thought, would be complete without 
Madge L. Schaefer's name somewhere near the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take a lot of credit for the way Thousand Oaks has turned out," she said. 
"I consider this a slight and I'd like it to be publicly corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer learned late Thursday that she'll get her wish. 
</P>
<P>
 The list Fiore read during Tuesday night's ribbon-cutting ceremony in the 
Civic Arts Plaza was supposed to be a roll call of civic leaders who had been 
honored in the past by having their names inscribed on seats in the old City 
Hall. By recognizing each "outstanding citizen," Fiore was effectively 
rededicating the seats -- transferring the plaques to the new council chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 But his list contained only 16 names. Over the years, 18 people had been 
honored with seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Schaefer and former Councilman Ed Jones had slipped from the list. 
</P>
<P>
 No one realized the omissions at the time -- at least, no one came forward to 
protest. But the next day, a friend told Schaefer about the ceremony and 
suggested that the list had been glaringly incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it," Schaefer concluded. And she set about to remedy the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the city clerk. She called the city manager. After a day of 
complaining, she got results. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a major apology due," City Manager Grant Brimhall said. "It's very 
clear that some mistakes have been made." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was quick to forgive and forget. "I know it wasn't intentional," he said 
mildly. "They just needed to do a little bit more research." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer, however, was not about to take the official "oops" at face value. 
</P>
<P>
 In her eight years on the council, Schaefer took pride in her frequent, flashy 
clashes with the political establishment. And she could not resist a chance to 
tweak the city bureaucracy for leaving her off the list of outstanding 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "On a scale of importance from one to 10, this is a one-half," Schaefer 
acknowledged. "But it's another petty, political ploy that comes from somewhere 
in the management. . . . It's not so much the (lack of) recognition that 
bothers me. It's that they're trying to rewrite history." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials -- who dug up an audio tape of the Nov. 18, 1986 meeting to 
confirm that both Schaefer and Jones were awarded seats -- insist they made an 
honest error. They will hold a separate ceremony to honor the two former 
council members later this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right thing will be done, belatedly," Brimhall promised. 
</P>
<P>
 But after accepting blame, Brimhall couldn't resist one jab at Schaefer. "One 
of the nicest things that can happen in anyone's life," he said pointedly, "is 
forgiveness."

EUCALYPTUS TREES TO BE CUT DOWN FOR PROJECT; SIMI VALLEY: GROVE WILL MAKE WAY 
FOR A 93-HOUSE SUBDIVISION. NEIGHBORS HAVE MIXED FEELINGS BUT ARE FED UP WITH 
VACANT LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sick, old and in the way, 97 majestic blue gum eucalyptus trees in Simi Valley 
will fall beneath the chain saw in two weeks to make way for a 93-house 
subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the 37-acre lot at the corner of Alamo Street and Tapo Canyon 
Road said Thursday they wish the trees could stay. But they say they are glad 
the new subdivision will crowd out the hard-drinking homeless people and 
partying teen-agers who sometimes hang out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saddened by the trees being cut down, but I'm elated they're going to be 
cut down because we have teen-agers doing drugs in there," said Pat Tripodo, 
40, who lives on neighboring Eucalyptus Street. "I kind of like having a field 
at the end of the street -- it's just a bit of country for us in the middle of 
the city."  
</P>
<P>
 The 50- to 70-foot trees are home to hawks and a play area for neighborhood 
children, said Pam Stalker, 36, of Eucalyptus Street. But she said it is time 
they were cut down and houses built to spare neighbors the spectacle of 
homeless people defecating in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 60 years ago, citrus ranchers planted the grid of fast-growing trees 
around their rectangular groves to shield crops from the punishing Santa Ana 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
 But when water got too expensive citrus ranching was abandoned and the 
eucalyptuses were left to fend for themselves, said Michael Kuhn, Simi Valley 
senior planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the eucalyptus long-horned borers. 
</P>
<P>
 This hungry larval form of a long-antennaed Australian beetle hitchhiked to 
Southern California aboard a boatload of eucalyptus logs about 10 years ago and 
quickly infested trees around the region, including many at Alamo and Tapo 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The borers are the only known enemy of the eucalyptus, but they are 
relentless, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have gnawed through the trees' sheaths of living bark and sent many of 
the lofty hardwood trees spiraling toward death, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the meandering channels that borers chewed through the bark of a 
toppled tree, now reduced to a dead stump after loggers carted the rest of it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Other infested trees still stand around the dusty field, their sickle-shaped 
leaves gone brown and their tops fallen bare. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the borers, Kuhn said, falling branches and the incessant litter 
of peeling bark make the eucalyptus trees too dangerous and impractical for 
housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't preserve them in the back yards and side yards because they're 
self-pruning," he said. "They're very trashy; they drop big limbs from high up 
in the tree and they fall over." 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to save a dozen uninfested blue gum and red gum eucalyptuses 
that line Alamo Street, irrigating them to thwart the worms' attack, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest are as good as dead, Kuhn said, adding: "There is no defense 
against (the borers). You can't spray for them, there's no birds that eat them. 
They're insects from Australia so there's nothing that recognizes them as 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, neighbors campaigned in public hearings on the project to save the 
trees, said Eucalyptus Street resident Robert Bridges, 35.  
</P>
<P>
 But then the neighbors learned that the trees were pretty much doomed to be 
bug food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see them go, they're gorgeous," Bridges said. "I've got three boys, 
and they love playing out there. But I guess it's time."

GLIMMERS OF HOPE AMID HORROR FOR SOME RWANDANS

 Foaming at the mouth and panting, the parched and emaciated boy lay on an 
olive-drab stretcher, the body inside his yellow-and-red T-shirt wasted down to 
the size of a healthy 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Kevin Kus, 37, held a thick syringe of solution of rehydration salts in 
his hands, squeezing it drip by drip into the clear plastic tube that led into 
the boy's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 A father himself, the small, stocky soldier from Sheffield, England, was 
stunned at how small the 5-year-old Rwandan had become. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a son that age myself," the gentle Yorkshireman said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, attention may have turned largely to other, more immediate crisis 
situations, such as those in Cuba and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But sickness, suffering and death continue in Rwanda and in the crowded 
refugee camps now sprinkled outside this Central African nation's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, there is also life and recovery in some places, as large-scale 
international efforts continue to stitch together a new health care network to 
care for those who have survived ethnic massacre, civil war and days or weeks 
of panicked wandering as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The high emergency, I think we today can say, is under control," James P. 
Grant, executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, said as he 
ended a visit to Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Enormous problems remain, the American U.N. official readily acknowledged, 
especially in the camps in Zaire, where more than 1 million Rwandans in exile 
have packed together in horrible conditions and where a cholera epidemic had 
flared but waned by last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is now time, UNICEF's director said, "to look at how to get the process 
of normality, the systems, going." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, that means to rebuild a crippled country's ability to treat its sick 
and keep everyone else in good health. 
</P>
<P>
 In a schoolhouse of honey-hued brick in this dusty, ramshackle town near 
Rwanda's southern border, a British medical team has set up shop to help deal 
with the needs of 60,000 people who hurriedly left their homes and now sleep 
restlessly on the hillsides beneath sheets of green plastic, not knowing 
whether they can ever go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel good, and you feel very frustrated because there's so much that you 
can't do," said Sgt. Rich Richardson, 34, of Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees with gaping slashes from machete wounds, unattended babies who have 
stumbled into cooking fires or pots of boiling water at the camp and cattle 
poachers with gunshot wounds, have been brought in to be cared for by the 
British doctors and medics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a pay-back. It's treating sick people instead of people who whine," 
said Eddie Chaloner, 30, a junior surgeon in the Territorial Army, Britain's 
equivalent of the National Guard, who recently wrapped up a six-month stint at 
London's St. Bartholomew's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Chaloner makes his rounds here in a green T-shirt with an SA-80 automatic 
rifle slung over one shoulder and a stethoscope over the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Rwandans are in great need. Others are past all help. 
</P>
<P>
 This week in a former classroom now lined with a score of field stretchers and 
beds, a 20-year-old woman whose card gave her name only as Niyongagina lay 
quaking with fever under a gray-brown blanket. Infected with the region's most 
dangerous strain of malaria, her dark eyes coated with a filmy glaze, she 
trembled so hard that her metal-framed bed shook. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one's already knocking at death's door," said Lee Harrop, 23, a 
thick-armed combat medical technician from Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was shortly after 1 p.m. The bodies of two children, one who succumbed to 
meningitis, the other to malnutrition, had been carried out by orderlies that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, 450 Rwandans, some hobbling weakly on staves, others carrying 
desperately thin children, line up each day outside the school to be treated by 
the Britons, who have been in Rwanda since Aug. 2. Most just need what is known 
as "oral rehydration." 
</P>
<P>
 Under awnings made from plastic sheeting, they come to sit out of the sun on 
three rows of benches and drink from canteen cups filled with a solution of 
electrolyte powder, which will replenish the natural salts that their bodies 
have lost through stress or malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these Rwandans appear disoriented and numbed by the near-hell that 
their lives have become. The children stare empty-eyed, not bothering to brush 
away flies that light on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 In another classroom, where young paratroopers work to cassettes of Mariah 
Carey or the Brand New Heavies, more serious cases are given fluids 
intravenously, or like the emaciated 5-year-old Kus was caring for, by 
nasal-gastric drip. 
</P>
<P>
 Small infants have a special need: Many are now too weak to suckle at their 
mother's breast, or their mothers, exhausted by flight and the privations of 
life in the camps, have stopped lactating. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Rwandans' often unforgiving struggle to survive, cases like these -- 
the young or the weak -- can lose out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can put a blanket on one of them, and you come back the next day, and the 
blanket is gone," Lance Cpl. Danny Dixbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 British soldiers have been posted at the entrance to the schoolyard to keep 
order, because stronger, healthier refugees were often pushing the very sick or 
young to the back of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the Rwandans treated are HIV-positive, mirroring the ravages 
of AIDS in this landlocked region just south of the Equator. As a precaution, 
the Britons wear white plastic gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 35 patients have died in treatment. But once or twice a day, on a 
metal table equipped with gynecological stirrups, babies are also delivered in 
the school-turned-hospital, at a ratio of two live births to each stillbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 In this town in Rwanda's southwest, where the French in June created a 
sanctuary for fleeing refugees, causing an estimated half a million people to 
flood in, the tasks performed by the Britons indicate on a small scale how much 
must be done to heal a country mauled by massacre and war. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Engineers in T-shirts, their faces yellow-brown with dust, are repairing 
the culverts on the rutted, unpaved road that links Kibeho with the city of 
Gikongoro to the north, so the lifeline for relief supplies to the refugees 
will not be washed out in the coming rainy reason. 
</P>
<P>
 To stave off the threat of dysentery in the camps, Capt. David Micciche of the 
Royal Army Medical Corps is directing a nine-member team helping supply the 
refugees with clean drinking water. The only available raw water source at the 
moment is a dirty hillside creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The captain and his men can supply 18,000 liters, or about the same number of 
quarts, of treated water a day -- a tumblerful or so for each refugee. But 
Micciche has just received two 10,000-liter tanks designed to filter out 
sediment, and he said production should soon increase to about 50,000 liters. 
</P>
<P>
 On a countrywide basis, UNICEF's Grant said his agency, as part of a 
$55-million emergency aid program, plans to help get 150 of the 350 health 
centers that Rwanda had in operation before the war up and running again by the 
end of the year. The French medical assistance group Doctors Without Borders is 
taking charge of 30 others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At present, the central medical stores are being stocked," an upbeat Grant 
told a weekend news conference in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. "We expect that by 
the end of September, the basic essential drugs system of the country will be 
at normal." 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious, though, that Rwanda will require long-term, lavish assistance 
in rebuilding its health care network, because so many doctors and nurses died 
in the massacres in April and May, while many others fled over the border with 
the other refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The British hope to be out of Kibeho by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "But things could happen," Richardson admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear who would replace the Britons, who complain that the Rwandan 
nurses who work the night shift are so lackadaisical that they do not change 
the intravenous drip bottles, causing the tubes stuck into patients' veins to 
clog. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of overcrowding in the camps, Chaloner said outbreaks of pneumonia, 
measles and meningitis among their 60,000 occupants are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a supply of clean water and latrines for the sanitary disposal of human 
waste are soon in place, the looming rains could also bring dysentery and a 
host of other health problems, along with the ever-present threat of 
mosquito-borne malaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Another consideration is the emotional state of the helpers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that witnessing so much suffering and death might disturb the 
soldiers, British generals sent along a military psychiatrist, Maj. Ian Palmer, 
to keep an eye on the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said those concerns, so far, have been unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 What has surprised the British, he said, is the quiet stoicism of many of the 
Rwandans and their capacity to bear pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of death in kids and so forth," Palmer, 40, explained. "I think 
most of the soldiers expect more grief and anger. It's certainly there. But the 
parents won't show it. We've had people come in with mine wounds -- in England, 
they'd be screaming. Here, they just bear it."

IN ARMY TOWN, BUSINESS AND WORRIES ARE PICKING UP; HOME FRONT: AS SOLDIERS 
STOCK UP AND CONVOYS MOVE OUT, RESIDENTS NEAR NORTH CAROLINA BASE SEE SIGNS OF 
WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The ritual is familiar: the ships of war leaving the dock, the wives and 
children waving tearful farewells, members of Congress bellowing about whether 
the national interest is truly at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the images of a time when the country is poised on the brink of 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this small and friendly military town near Ft. Bragg -- home of the 
rapid-deployment specialists of the Army's 18th Airborne Corps -- such scenes 
are more than just images. In Spring Lake, war is not a video game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, the smiling young woman behind the counter at Revco Drugs, said that she 
expected her husband -- who returned not long ago from service in Somalia -- to 
be mustered out of the Army two months from now. Instead, he is on standby 
alert for Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Wal-Mart store next door, the aisles are filled with special forces 
troops in camouflage fatigues and red berets, stocking up on last-minute items, 
convinced that they are about to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three pair of boxer shorts for $25?" asked one soldier, who had the muscles 
and smooth skin of someone barely 20. "I ain't taking those overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're supposed to give us loose cotton T-shirts and underwear," 
said his buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 While officers may know the details of a possible invasion of Haiti, the 
enlisted men apparently do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Spring Lake and the nearby towns of pine-tree-studded countryside in 
central North Carolina, everyone would know dozens of people embroiled in any 
battle. Yellow ribbons and signs of encouragement in store windows are likely 
to be visible everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In Old Sarge's surplus store, a tilting wooden house painted in camouflage 
colors where soldiers can get dog tags made, patches sewn on and uniforms 
mended, business is already up 800%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets like this when there is about to be a deployment," said the woman 
behind the counter, who asked that her name not be used. For three days it has 
been difficult to move among the aisles because of all the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have a nice day," she told one trooper with a Special Forces patch, who was 
buying extra dog tags. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arrrghhh," he groaned to convey that a nice day seemed to be an unlikely 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 But some signs of impending invasion are not so subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeways from Fayetteville to the port of Wilmington were crammed earlier 
this week with convoys of equipment -- thousands of trucks and Humvees and at 
least 39 Sheridan M-551 tanks to be loaded for an impending operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bragg Convoys Clog Roads" read the headline in the local paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't move," said a corporal eating lunch at Pizza Hut. "With all the 
stuff we had on the road, it has to be a massive deployment." 
</P>
<P>
 "And it didn't look like no exercise," a buddy chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
 For two days, the local television news stations have shown film of equipment 
being loaded onto ships at the Sunny Point Army port near Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 While speculation grows, there is official silence at Ft. Bragg. Reporters are 
forbidden to talk to anyone on post and are threatened with arrest if they 
disobey. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers know the order and refused to give their names. And most "don't 
know anything anyway," a public affairs officer warned. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is something that cannot be talked about, something that is not fully 
known. "You here to do a story about the deployment?" asked a sergeant, who 
insisted on simply being called D.L. from Houston. He was waiting in line at a 
Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant off post. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deployment to where?" asked his buddy, facetiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosnia," answered D.L. with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the seeming likelihood of an invasion of Haiti, fear seemed muted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is up in arms about it," said Dave Farrell, who works at the Radio 
Shack just off the base, where customers are mostly soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are afraid, some aren't," said Kim at Revco, whose husband works 
in communications. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the 82nd Airborne, which is part of the 18th, announced the 
opening of a center designed to help families cope with any deployment of 
troops. The center will provide daily updates on soldiers in combat, 
long-distance phone lines and fax machines, and sessions with support groups. 
The center was months in the planning, but the timing of the opening this week 
seems more than coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Many family members echo the philosophy of the military: "We're ready for 
whatever happens," said Barbara, whose husband is on standby. "Ready to go in 
18 hours. But we're ready to do that all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The 82nd Airborne, "The All Americans," as the unit's soldiers are called, led 
the invasion of Grenada in 1983, was sent to Honduras in 1988 expecting to 
fight Nicaraguan Sandinistas, led the invasion of Panama in 1989 and led the 
ground offensive in the Persian Gulf War in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems little doubt that the 82nd will go to Haiti too if there is an 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the equipment that clogged the roads around here was assigned to the 
82nd. Tuesday night, more than 900 paratroopers from the 82nd jumped into Ft. 
Bragg's Gela Drop Zone in a mock invasion, practicing seizing an airfield and 
evacuating civilians from a combat area. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, there is mostly anticipation, even excitement. On television, the 
soldiers engaged in the massive loading of ships at the Sunny Point Army port 
talked with pride about the complexity of the current operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the soldiers who moonlight as bartenders at MG's Sports Bar, midway 
between Ft. Bragg and Pope Air Force Base a couple of miles away, already have 
been deployed, either to ships steaming toward Haiti or to load cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds at MG's now are slim, said Billy, the bartender. Only about a dozen 
soldiers were shooting pool and drinking Wednesday night in the sprawling 
palace of neon beer displays, video games and big-screen TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys are on standby and don't want to drink," said Billy, asking 
that his last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, life still seems mostly normal, more so than it will 18 hours 
from now, or 36, or 54, whenever the order comes.

KILLER BEE MARCH STOPS AT STATE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So where the hell are the killer bees? 
</P>
<P>
 The much-hyped and seemingly inexorable invasion of Apis mellifera scutellatus 
appears to have screeched to a halt at the California-Arizona border. 
</P>
<P>
 The Africanized honeybees -- which have camped out for months in Yuma -- were 
expected to swarm into Southern California during the spring or summer. But the 
Colorado River has turned into something of a Rubicon that the hotheaded 
insects can't seem to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have several hypotheses for their aborted progress: Because of a dry 
spring, the desert was inhospitable for safe passage, lacking the water, food 
and shelter to accommodate the crossing. Or perhaps the bees have run into one 
of their few natural predators, a mite that infests their honeycombs and 
consumes their larvae. 
</P>
<P>
 But most intriguing, some experts surmise that these tropical bees are 
genetically ill-equipped for more temperate climes and finally could be 
reaching the northward limits of an airborne journey that has stoked fear and 
titillation among Southern Californians and Hollywood filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the bees don't try to cross into Southern California next spring, 
some authorities fear that they will sneak into the Central Valley when 
beekeepers from Arizona -- where the Africanized bee has established itself -- 
import bee colonies to pollinate crops in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 So public agencies in Southern California remain on guard. Throughout the 
summer and spring, they set up "Bee Alert" booths at county fairs, instructed 
schoolchildren on the dangers of bees and trained firefighters in how to rescue 
victims of mass-stinging attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County vector control office purchased protective bee suits and 
special spraying equipment and hired three people to do battle with the bees. 
"It's like we're all dressed up and have nowhere to go," said Fred Beams. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the three bee fighters are assigned to rat patrol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael C. Pearson, the bee specialist with the Los Angeles County Department 
of Agriculture, said the bees' delayed arrival "has bought us more time to get 
ready. We're still very concerned the bees will come and pose a serious public 
health risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some officials fear that the public may feel that it was duped into 
thinking the sky was falling -- and won't be as cautious if and when the bees 
do arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had (public education) momentum, and the fact that the bees haven't gotten 
here yet has hurt our efforts," said Bill Routhier, the San Diego-based bee 
specialist for the state Department of Agriculture. "It's going to take a real 
effort to get that momentum going again." 
</P>
<P>
 The hyper-defensive bees were unwittingly released in 1957 from a Brazilian 
laboratory where they were being studied for their tolerance to heat. They had 
been brought to Brazil from Africa a year earlier. The bees moved on to Central 
America and Mexico and arrived in Texas in 1990 and in Arizona in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When several colonies were trapped in Yuma last spring, public safety and 
agricultural experts sounded the alarm, saying the bees could arrive in 
California any day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that scenario's failure to materialize, bee experts say that, with a 
wet winter, the bees might find the desert more hospitable for travel next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspicion that the bee may have encountered its ecological limit intrigues 
scientists, who were not sure where that barrier would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can now scale back the maps on how far north we thought the bees 
would travel," said Eric Mussen, a UC Davis Cooperative Extension apiculturist 
who has watched the bees' progress with fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might still get into San Diego or even the Los Angeles Basin, but I 
don't think they'll have the genetic energy" to thrive here, he said. "Their 
big push northward, and spreading out, has slowed down and may be running out." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the bee has not wrought the havoc in southern Texas that was initially 
feared. Beekeepers there have had little difficulty keeping their European 
honeybee colonies free of Africanized honeybee invaders. And the majority of 
wild bee swarms in southern Texas are still of the more mellow European-bee 
variety, despite expectations that the Africanized bee would by now have 
overtaken their more docile cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 The only fatality from an Africanized bee attack in the United States occurred 
in 1993 in Texas when an elderly man, already in poor health, was stung 100 
times when trying to eradicate a colony with a torch. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, the bees have moved as far north as the suburbs of Houston; in 
Arizona, the bees have established themselves in Tucson and Phoenix. On 
Wednesday, Arizona recorded its 13th Africanized bee stinging attack on a 
person -- a Tucson-area man who was mowing the bank of a ditch and upset a 
ground-level hive. Even as he ran for his life, he used a cellular phone to 
call for help, and is now recovering from 100 stings. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the slow advance of the bees, some officials wonder if their appearance 
in Yuma was an aberration -- not part of some full frontal movement, but 
perhaps a colony that hitchhiked there on a truck. The fact that the bees have 
not regenerated in large numbers in Yuma suggests that they are struggling even 
there, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The three discoveries of Africanized bees in California were the result of 
hitchhiking bees -- once by truck, twice by ship. In July, the captain of a 
freighter entering Los Angeles Harbor from Guatemala notified authorities ahead 
of time that a colony of bees was on board. The bees were eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Routhier, the state's bee expert, says he is more concerned that the bees 
might enter the state by piggybacking on commercial European bee colonies from 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Arizona nor California regulates the movement of commercial bee 
colonies, and he said California is wide open to the unwitting shipment of 
Africanized bees here. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gene Brandi, a professional beekeeper in Los Banos who sits on the state's 
Africanized honeybee advisory board and on the board of the California State 
Beekeepers Assn., dismisses that concern. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bees do not enter from Yuma or by way of the Central Valley, Routhier 
speculates that they may eventually work their way north along the Colorado 
River and cross into the irrigated farmlands of the Coachella Valley in 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, authorities remain perplexed but vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so sure they'd be here any day, we were frantic, trying to get the 
word out," said Connie Valenzuela, deputy agricultural commissioner of Imperial 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, our message is, 'We don't know why they're not here yet, or when they'll 
get here, but you still need to know about them,' " she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the two men hired by the Imperial County vector control office to 
exterminate Africanized bee colonies have been shifted to mosquito abatement.

COLUMN ONE; A HELL FOR HAVE-NOTS IN SARAJEVO; ELDERLY WIDOW NADA LISSE SUBSISTS 
ON ROTTEN VEGETABLES AND LONGS FOR MEDICINE FOR HER FRIEND. MEANWHILE, THE RICH 
AND THE CORRUPT ENJOY BOUNTY OF A BLACK MARKET THAT CONTROLS EVERYTHING FROM 
FOOD TO FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The single room of Nada Lisse's apartment reeks of spoiled cabbage and 
unwashed flesh. There is no money to buy soap, and the pot of old vegetables 
has to last until the next day's lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fall, but the 71-year-old widow is already paralyzed by dread of the 
coming winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was on that couch in the corner that Emina froze to death last winter," 
the old woman says of her neighbor's sister, who had sought refuge from worse 
cold one story above. "We thought she was sick, but when we got her to the 
hospital the doctors told us she was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The aching poverty afflicting Lisse contrasts brutally with the bounty on 
display at public markets throughout the city and with the hopeful outlook 
younger Sarajevans have developed as signs of normal life have returned. Here, 
the crowded cafes and brisk trade in coveted goods -- such as liquor and passes 
to travel -- might create an impression of a city that has the worst of war's 
hardships behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sarajevo, in reality, has become a place of haves and have-nots. It is a 
city where black marketeers control everything from food to freedom. In 
Sarajevo, as in the corruption-ridden postwar Vienna of Graham Greene's "The 
Third Man," everything -- even survival -- has its price. 
</P>
<P>
 Life for most Sarajevans is an existence as grim as Lisse's -- endless days 
spent staring out broken windows at smoldering dumpsters or aimlessly plodding 
through rubble-strewn streets. Many endure an eternity from handout to handout, 
with no prospects for employment and all hopes for relief dashed. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those on the dealing end of the ubiquitous black markets, the 
dreariness can be tempered by luxuries acquired with ill-gotten gains. Fortunes 
amassed by trading across the front lines have bought fast cars that were 
smuggled in during the five-month period when one road into Sarajevo was open; 
black-market gasoline can be had for about $30 a gallon through a franchise 
controlled by the Ukrainian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 For a select few, such as liquor magnate Muhammed Kulasevic, this world, 
corrupted by conflict, can even be left behind. He can fly out on a U.N. plane 
with the humanitarian evacuation credentials that he says he made a deal for 
with Western European sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, influence-peddling is so pervasive that have-nots, such as Lisse, 
seem to be little bothered by the rampant social injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 As she reminisces about the better days behind her, when her husband was alive 
and she worked at an Austrian-owned bank, Lisse recalls with relish the taste 
of cheese and the smell of perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 But if she could have any one item now, she says, it would be eardrops for her 
beloved friend and neighbor, Sanija Talic, 75. Talic, who lost her sister to 
January's bitter cold, is legally blind and is at risk of losing her hearing.

 Both women scoff and wave away an outlandish suggestion that they might get 
the drops Talic needs from a hospital pharmacy. (A U.N.-operated humanitarian 
airlift has brought in food and medicine to this besieged city for more than 
two years.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just two useless old women," Lisse says, amusedly dismissing the chance 
of securing a commodity as rare as eardrops. "We could only dream of having 
such connections." 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor at Kosevo Hospital confirms there is no such treatment in stock. Any 
medicines, beyond the basics needed for trussing wounds and curing infections, 
are siphoned off by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 The army, and, thereby the government, controls most aid and commerce in 
Sarajevo through a labyrinthine system of licensing, franchises and favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuad Colpa owns what was one of Sarajevo's most popular businesses before the 
war: the Bazeni restaurant built into the stone embankment at a scenic curve of 
the Miljacka River. 
</P>
<P>
 Colpa explains that the only way to reopen his business when the worst of the 
shelling stopped in February was to secure a "priority use" designation from 
the government for water, electricity and other on-again, off-again utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the rating intended for hospitals, bakeries and other vital 
facilities, Colpa pays the local government a special tax -- some might call it 
a kickback -- that amounts to about $4,000 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 For Colpa, as important as the guarantee of water and power to run the 
restaurant is the permission to serve liquor that accompanies his priority 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "In wartime, it is forbidden to serve alcohol, but if you are a priority 
enterprise, it's no problem," Colpa says. "And if you don't serve alcohol, you 
don't have any business. People are drinking more now than ever, especially in 
the Old Town, which is at least 95% Muslim." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling Party for Democratic Action led by Bosnia's Muslim president, Alija 
Izetbegovic, occupies most local government offices and strongly influences the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop the outright payments received for doling out priority ratings to 
lucrative businesses like Colpa's, the government takes one-third of the value 
of everything brought into the city through the only access way available: a 
not-so-secret tunnel under Sarajevo's U.N.-controlled airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel, which runs from the city encircled by Bosnian Serbs to another 
area held by the Muslim government, was built last year by the army and remains 
under strict military control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army gets 33% of everything they bring through the tunnel, which is a lot 
now that the Blue Route is closed," confirms a humanitarian aid official, 
referring to the sole commercial road into this city of 380,000 people that was 
cinched off by Serbian rebels in late July. "The soldiers have recently 
installed rails on the tunnel floor and brought in six mining cars, so now all 
they have to do is push the goods through the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 Shipments of coffee, sugar, beer and other supplies ordered by enterprises 
such as Bazeni's move at the convenience of the army, which often needs to 
clear the narrow tunnel to transport troops for the ongoing battles along more 
than 1,000 miles of front line. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the main, hard-currency-earning activity surviving in the Bosnian 
capital, the soldiers manning the tunnel provide reliable-enough deliveries for 
restaurateurs to order fresh meat and seafood with their more durable staples. 
</P>
<P>
 The price for escape through the tunnel is determined by a more complicated 
formula, one in which prewar personal connections appear to be as strong an 
influence as the quantity of deutsche marks or dollars changing hands. A 
dizzying array of permissions and clearances is needed to leave this city, 
which for all practical purposes is closed to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who would flee need: an army authorization to move through the nearly 
mile-long tunnel; a sheaf of documents, including an all-but unobtainable 
military service waiver to an employer's attestation that the applicant's 
absence would not harm the capital's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate in clout that has sprung up in battered Sarajevo is a U.N. "blue 
card." Such a document is intended to allow senior government officials to 
travel abroad for important meetings or to clear humanitarian hardship cases 
for evacuation. It allows the bearer to fly out of Sarajevo on U.N. aircraft, 
which depart the capital several times daily, as conditions allow. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulasevic, the liquor magnate better known among Sarajevo's trading kingpins 
as Muki, has neither illness nor official capacity to justify his credentials. 
His diamond pinky ring and Ray Ban sunglasses testify to his ample means, but 
he is coy about the details of his "blue card" acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 The stout 36-year-old has also been exempted from military service, despite 
the full mobilization of adult men that has been in effect since Serbian 
nationalist rebels began besieging this city in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "My business is vital to the army, which is why I am exempt," he explains with 
a knowing grin. "Somebody has to keep the army supplied so it can function." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, much of the activity that would be deemed corruption in peacetime is 
justified by officials as a necessary evil inflicted by a war that supporters 
of a multicultural society never wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 With little functioning industry to produce tax revenue, those involved in the 
favor network explain, the government must raise hard currency through 
unconventional sources to feed, clothe and arm the force that protects what is 
left of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the economy is not functioning, it is good that food is being brought 
in by whatever methods," says taxi driver Sabriji Sebo, who pays at least 
one-third of his monthly earnings of less than $200 in taxes, license fees and 
priority access to gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those making millions while most people suffer should be punished. When 
the war is over and we have a real state, they should be brought to justice. 
One day they will have to answer for what they did." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the elderly, such as Lisse, and Bosnia's 2 million hungry and 
displaced, there is little comfort in contemplating the remote possibility of a 
comeuppance for those who took advantage of their suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of smuggled eardrops for Talic is so far beyond the imaginations of 
either widow that they haven't even inquired in what they suspect are the right 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 So they hold hands and stare out the window together. They are content with 
sharing experiences, instead of retelling them to each other later. And they 
count as a blessing the futility of putting into words their fears of the 
coming winter.

WILSON WOULD EXPEL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM SCHOOLS; POLITICS: SAYING STATE 
CAN'T AFFORD TO EDUCATE THEM, HE CLARIFIES STAND ON PROP. 187. BROWN CHARGES 
HYPOCRISY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB and BILL STALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Answering a question he has avoided for more than a year, Gov. Pete Wilson 
said Thursday that he would favor expelling illegal immigrants from the public 
schools if the U.S. Supreme Court allows it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor said the state cannot afford the estimated $1.5 
billion it costs to educate more than 300,000 illegal immigrants now attending 
kindergarten through 12th-grade classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot educate every child from here to Tierra del Fuego," Wilson said at 
a news conference in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the Republican governor has backed Proposition 187 -- an 
anti-illegal immigration measure on the November ballot -- but until Thursday 
had not taken a stand on the initiative's most explosive provisions, which 
would bar illegal immigrants from the state's schools and require educators to 
check on the citizenship status of all students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had said he favored the measure as a way to provoke a legal challenge 
to a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from denying illegal 
immigrants a public education. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed Thursday to explain what he would do if the Supreme Court upheld 
the initiative, Wilson said: "We implement the law." 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokeswoman later clarified the governor's comments, saying Wilson 
would prefer to see Proposition 187 coupled with a stronger federal effort to 
deport illegal immigrants so that children barred from schools do not remain in 
this country. But ultimately, the aide said, the governor supports the 
education provisions of the proposition as written. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's upheld, that is fine with him," said Communications Director Leslie 
Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's comments came as the immigration issue re-emerged at the forefront of 
his reelection campaign against Democrat Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown opposes Proposition 187. Removing children from the schools, she said 
Thursday, would be likely to result in "more trouble, more gangs, more guns, 
more graffiti and more cost to the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning Thursday in Los Angeles, Brown stepped up her charge that Wilson 
has been a hypocrite on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 She cited letters that Wilson, then a U.S. senator, wrote in 1987 to President 
Ronald Reagan and his attorney general, Edwin Meese, complaining that the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service was making it too difficult for Mexican 
farm workers to enter the country to pick crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also blasted Wilson for trying now to curtail health services to illegal 
immigrants even though he voted as a senator to provide them. And she showed an 
informational videotape featuring Wilson in which the state encourages 
non-citizens to apply for government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson votes to impose health care mandates -- and now he campaigns 
against them," Brown said. "He cut a hole in the fence to allow millions of 
illegal immigrants in, and now he wants to patch that hole because that's what 
the polls tell him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aides, in response, said he favored a stricter guest worker program 
when he was a senator but had to settle for the weaker version drafted by 
Democrats in the House of Representatives. He wrote the letters, they said, 
because California farmers faced a severe labor shortage and needed migrant 
workers quicker than the federal government was processing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, Wilson's press secretary, said the informational video cited by 
Brown was pulled recently after the state Health and Welfare Agency realized it 
was being shown in informational kiosks throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some bureaucrat somewhere was asleep at the switch, but the governor is 
absolutely adamant, crystal clear on his views on this issue," Walsh said. 
"Folks better shape up." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson on Thursday also signed legislation cracking down on immigration fraud, 
prohibiting the issuance of state contracts to companies convicted of hiring 
illegal immigrants, and easing the transfer of illegal immigrant felons from 
state prisons to federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference, Wilson spoke at length about Proposition 187, which he 
has said he will vote for but has yet to formally endorse. The measure would 
prohibit the delivery of public services, except emergency medical care, to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is opposed by the California Teachers Assn., the California 
Medical Assn., some law enforcement groups and business associations, which say 
the measure is too extreme. However, a Los Angeles Times poll this week found 
wide public support for it, with 62% of likely voters saying they favor passage 
of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has tried to walk a fine line on the education issue. Although he has 
complained about the cost of educating illegal immigrants since early 1993, the 
governor has refused to say whether he personally favored kicking out of school 
those children who are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Wilson again tried to deflect the question by asserting that the 
federal government, not the state, would ultimately decide how to handle those 
children. But when asked to state his personal opinion, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, I think, there has to be a clear line drawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson noted that federal law for eight years has required employers to verify 
the legal status of those they hire and said he believes the same standard 
should apply to public services. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 were upheld, Wilson said, he would "institute some kind of 
orderly process of determining who was legally in school or what parents were 
or were not legal and begin that kind of deportation that is necessary."

HAIR FOUND ON BODY REPORTEDLY LIKE SIMPSON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Microscopic analysis shows that a hair discovered on the body of Ronald Lyle 
Goldman has similarities to samples taken from O.J. Simpson, sources close to 
the case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests performed on that hair are not as definitive as DNA analysis being 
conducted on blood samples and thus cannot show as precisely the source of the 
hair, sources said. Nevertheless, the results show that the hair came from a 
black person and that the sample has other physical characteristics that 
suggest similarities with Simpson's hair, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 That could bolster the prosecution's case by suggesting that Simpson had 
contact with Goldman at the murder scene -- a scenario that would contradict 
the football great's statement to police that he was home waiting for an 
airport limousine when the slayings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to 
comment on any scientific tests connected to the Simpson case. Simpson, who was 
arrested in June, has pleaded not guilty in the slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole 
Brown Simpson, and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 As they build their case against Simpson, prosecutors have amassed dozens of 
pieces of physical evidence -- most notably a collection of bloodstains at the 
murder scene and Simpson's Brentwood estate. The blood samples are being 
subjected to DNA analysis, and some of those tests have been completed, sources 
said Wednesday. According to those sources, final test results that have been 
produced so far show that bloodstains from at least two drops near the bodies 
contain genetic markers identical to those found in Simpson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results confirm preliminary findings, but defense sources Thursday 
downplayed their significance, saying Simpson's lawyers already are prepared to 
wage an aggressive attack on the reliability of the tests and the procedures 
used to collect the samples. The latest results, those sources said, do not 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tests are being performed on blood found in Simpson's car and at his 
home, as well as on a pair of leather gloves -- one found at the crime scene, 
the other outside Simpson's residence. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the DNA tests, a number of items have been combed for hair and 
fibers. A knit cap found near the bodies, for instance, had hairs inside and 
out, including some that sources say resemble Simpson's hair, some that appear 
to be Nicole Simpson's hair, and some that appear not to come either from 
Simpson or the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the hair discovered on Goldman's body that has attracted the greatest 
interest because it would be the most difficult for Simpson to explain. Still, 
experts warned that microscopic hair analysis is far less exact than DNA 
analysis. Hairs can sometimes be subjected to DNA analysis, but only if there 
is enough follicle for scientists to analyze. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the "Handbook of Forensic Science" used by the FBI, microscopic 
examination of hair samples can determine whether a hair could have originated 
from a particular person and can show the race and sometimes the gender of the 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, hair will reveal more specific detail about the possible source 
because some hairs have unusual characteristics -- cracks, splits or diseases 
-- that allow more precise identification, according to an FBI law enforcement 
bulletin on the subject. But hair cannot reveal other identifying details such 
as the person's age. 
</P>
<P>
 The handbook describes microscopic hair analysis as: "Not positive evidence; 
however, (it) is good circumstantial evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the hair on Goldman's body closely resembles Simpson's in many 
respects, experts say there could be explanations other than the suggestion 
that Simpson was at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Simpson's lawyers could argue that the presence of a single 
hair on Goldman's body raises doubts about the prosecution theory that he and 
Simpson struggled violently. Such a struggle would almost certainly have caused 
Simpson to lose a number of hairs, sources close to the case say. So why would 
only one show up on Goldman? 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Goldman's body was found outside a condominium belonging to 
Nicole Simpson. O.J. Simpson visited there frequently and thus could have left 
hairs on another occasion, sources noted. One of those hairs could have stuck 
to Goldman when he fell, according to that scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 With Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito on vacation, the legal maneuvering in 
the Simpson case has unfolded mostly behind closed doors in recent days. 
Thursday, prosecutors filed a motion in response to the defense's argument 
against sequestering the jury, but they submitted the document under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have asked that the jury be sequestered to prevent panelists from 
being exposed to the crush of publicity in the case. Defense attorneys 
countered with a motion filed earlier this week, but it also was filed under 
seal. 
</P>
<P>
 The case returns to court Monday, however, when Ito has scheduled the first of 
a week's worth of hearings on several issues. Ito is expected to hear arguments 
and rule on a defense motion to dismiss the case for lack of evidence, another 
defense motion to suppress evidence seized during several searches, and the 
prosecution motion for a sequestered jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hiatus in hearings during the past two weeks, lawyers and 
investigators for both sides have been scrambling to put together their cases 
for trial. The defense investigative team, which suffered a brief setback when 
state authorities cracked down on several investigators for lacking state 
licenses, now is out from under that cloud, according to members of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that controversy came up, they came over to me, and now they are 
basically my employees," said John Dresden, a Los Angeles private investigator 
who said he has been licensed since 1974. "Now things are going very good." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, families of the two victims, who have given interviews 
since the June 12 murders but have largely remained behind the scenes, spoke on 
national television for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview that aired Thursday on the ABC News program "PrimeTime Live," 
Nicole Simpson's parents and three sisters told of the tensions they saw 
between Nicole and O.J. Simpson on June 12, hours before she was killed. They 
said O.J. Simpson did not speak to his ex-wife at a recital for their daughter 
that day, and that Nicole Simpson did not invite him to join them for dinner 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole's mother described how she later stood beside her daughter's coffin and 
asked O.J. Simpson directly if he was responsible for the murder. "He said, 
'No, I loved your daughter,' " Juditha Brown told interviewer Diane Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The football great was "insanely jealous" of his wife, her sister Dominique 
Brown said. "He was real possessive. . . . He wanted her to be attractive, but 
for him, and that's as far as it went. He was just very possessive of her." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns also provided telephone records confirming previous reports that 
Nicole Simpson's mother called her daughter at 9:40 p.m. on the night of the 
murders. That is the last known time that Nicole Simpson was alive. The time of 
the call is potentially important because it could help establish whether O.J. 
Simpson would have had time to commit the crime and still be home to meet an 
airport limousine about 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goldman family is scheduled to appear tonight on ABC's "20/20." A 
transcript of that broadcast was released Thursday. In it, Goldman's family 
members describe Ronald Goldman in detail and say they are worried that his 
life has been distorted by news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say they have not heard from Simpson, but Goldman's sister Kim said 
she had not prejudged him. "You're innocent till proven guilty," she said.

BASIC PHONE FEES TO RISE, TOLL CALL CHARGES TO FALL; DEREGULATION: THE PUC 
ACTION CAPS SEVEN YEARS OF TEMPESTUOUS HEARINGS. IT MEETS WITH WIDE CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a long-awaited ruling that will dramatically alter telephone pricing in 
California, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday opened so-called 
local long-distance calling to competition beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the policy change, the commission approved a substantial increase 
in basic local service charges -- some GTE customers' rates will climb as much 
as 80%. But prices for local long-distance, or toll calls -- defined as calls 
between points more than 12 miles apart but within local calling regions -- 
will plummet as long-distance companies such as AT & T and MCI enter a market 
currently reserved for Pacific Bell and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial decision -- which caps seven years of tempestuous hearings 
and deliberations -- is the first step in the arduous process of deregulating 
telecommunications in California, which lags far behind most of the nation in 
promoting phone service competition. The commission actually delivered a final 
ruling on toll calling a year ago, but was forced to rescind it after it was 
learned that a Pacific Bell employee helped write it. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Thursday's ruling drew criticism from most of those involved in 
the telephone regulation process: Consumer groups decried the local service 
rate increases, long-distance carriers complained about cumbersome access codes 
that customers will have to dial to use a carrier other than the local phone 
company, and Pacific Bell and GTE -- though generally pleased with the ruling 
-- grumbled about not getting the changes they sought. Pacific Bell had wanted 
to cut toll rates further while GTE was concerned that increases in basic rates 
were insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the utilities commission, more than half of California's 
residential customers will end up paying more for phone service under its new 
rate structure, with GTE customers having bigger increases than Pacific Bell 
customers. The median phone bill will rise 2% for Pacific Bell customers and 
16% for GTE customers, and consumers will face a confusing array of new choices 
for local long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Large businesses, and anyone who makes a lot of local long-distance calls, can 
look forward to substantially lower bills. Calls between Los Angeles and 
Riverside, for example, or between Anaheim and Santa Monica are toll calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in basic service is designed to offset revenues Pacific Bell and 
GTE are expected to lose when they surrender their monopolies in the $3-billion 
local long-distance market. The monthly flat rate for Pacific Bell residential 
customers will increase 35% to $11.25 from $8.35. For GTE customers, the 
monthly flat rate will leap 54% to $17.25 from $11.20. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consumer is getting the shaft here," said Audrie Krause, executive 
director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a San Francisco-based advocacy 
group. The hardest-hit group will be the estimated 20% to 30% of phone 
customers who don't make toll calls monthly, mostly elderly people or working 
poor who don't qualify for discounted lifeline rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that make many toll calls will be the big winners. Rates for 
daytime toll calls, made mostly by businesses, will fall an average of 44% 
under the commission's ruling -- and they could fall even more depending on how 
aggressively the nearly 100 long-distance carriers compete for a piece of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But small businesses that make few local long-distance calls will end up 
paying substantially more under the new plan. GTE's monthly basic business rate 
is going up 83% to $19.22. Pacific Bell's monthly basic business rate is rising 
24% to $10.32. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-distance industry is furious that the new policy does not require 
Pacific Bell and GTE to provide so-called 1-plus dialing for toll calls. 
Although a customer who uses, for example, MCI for regular long-distance 
service only needs to dial a 1, the area code and number, the same customer 
using MCI for local long distance will have to dial a five-digit access code 
first. They will also have to know the toll call boundaries in order to know 
when to use the codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not real competition," Krause said. "People are going to have to get 
out maps and books and study them. . . . It's going to be very confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 MCI denounced the access code requirement as a "Rube Goldberg-like process" 
and a "Pacific Bell ruse" that would thwart the development of true 
competition. The commission, noting that it is not technically possible to 
implement 1-plus dialing by Jan. 1, sided with Pacific Bell and GTE, which 
argued that such a requirement would be unduly expensive to implement and thus 
would force more local rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI and AT & T urged the commission Thursday to speed up hearings on ordering 
the local carriers to install the technology making equal access calling 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell President David Dorman contended that even with new basic rate 
increases, customers will still pay less than the true cost of providing the 
service. But he praised the commission's ruling, saying it gave Pacific Bell 
the ability to compete with long-distance companies -- which he said had 
already siphoned off $500 million in toll call business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although long-distance companies can't compete directly for the toll business 
now, some corporations have installed technology that allows them to bypass the 
local phone company and link directly with a lower rate long-distance company, 
Dorman said.

CLINTON TELLS AMERICANS 'WE MUST ACT' NOW TO HELP HAITI; SPEECH: PRESIDENT 
WARNS REGIME: 'YOUR TIME IS UP. LEAVE NOW OR WE WILL FORCE YOU FROM POWER.' HE 
INSISTS U.S. HAS EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER OPTIONS FOR RESTORING CARIBBEAN NATION'S

<P>
 With massive military preparations pointing to an imminent U.S. invasion of 
Haiti, President Clinton delivered a blunt message to the Caribbean nation's 
military dictators: "Your time is up. Leave now or we will force you from 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 The President, grim-faced during a 15-minute nationally televised speech from 
the White House on Thursday night, combined an unequivocal warning to the 
Haitian regime that military action is at hand with an unusually direct appeal 
for support from an American public still skeptical and unconvinced that vital 
U.S. interests are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Haiti," he declared, "we have a case in which the right is clear, in which 
the country in question is nearby, in which our own interests are plain, in 
which the mission is achievable and limited, and in which the nations of the 
world stand with us. We must act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the American people are rightfully concerned whenever our soldiers are 
put at risk," Clinton said. "I assure you that no President makes decisions 
like this one without deep thought and prayer. But it's my job as President and 
commander in chief to take those actions that I believe will best protect our 
national security interests." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was Clinton's first full-scale effort to make his case for an 
invasion if the regime led by Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras continues to reject demands 
by the United States and the United Nations that it yield power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, I urge them to do so," Clinton said, but "they must move now. If 
they do not, the international community will act to honor our commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's warning was greeted with more defiance in Port-au-Prince. Cedras, 
interviewed by CBS-TV immediately after Clinton's speech, said: "I am rather 
prepared to fight with my people. . . . We are all ready to fight with the 
means we have. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Haitian people have an extraordinary resistance capacity," he added. 
"Those three years spent under economic sanctions have proven what I say. The 
people are ready to resist." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Cedras had said that a U.S. invasion would lead to civil 
war and a "massacre." He predicted "loss of life on both sides and also 
civilian casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said Clinton has decided to instruct the U.S. ambassador 
in Haiti, William L. Swing, to deliver private ultimatums to each of the top 
three military leaders -- Cedras; his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Philippe 
Biamby; and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, the police chief -- to leave the 
country or face capture by U.S. troops. Swing may deliver the messages within 
the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Swing will give the Haitians a fixed deadline to step down, the officials 
said, but the deadline will not be made public, to avoid touching off possible 
attacks by the military's backers against supporters of exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide or U.S. citizens in Haiti. Aristide, the first and only 
democratically elected president in Haitian history, was deposed by the 
military junta on Sept. 30, 1991. U.S. policy is to restore him to power.  
</P>
<P>
 The officials said Swing also will repeat Clinton's offer to guarantee the 
Haitian junta leaders safe passage out of the country and help in establishing 
them in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said the CIA has been authorized to spend substantial amounts 
of money, if necessary, to get the Haitians out of the country -- without 
resorting to outright bribery, however. The officials said Clinton authorized 
the CIA to spend up to $12 million on a range of covert operations in Haiti, 
including moving the dictators into exile. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking to rally public support behind his policy, the President offered 
four basic arguments to support his contention that vital U.S. interests are at 
stake in Haiti: 
</P>
<P>
 * Supporting democratic governments, especially in countries close to home, 
strengthens America's own security and fuels domestic prosperity, because 
history has shown free governments to be more stable and peaceable than 
dictatorships. They are also more likely to foster open economies that satisfy 
the aspirations of their people and open up trading opportunities for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continued chaos and repression in Haiti will lead to ever-larger waves of 
refugees risking their lives to escape to the United States, creating vexatious 
problems and burdensome costs for this country. About 14,000 Haitian refugees 
are already living in camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and 
the Haiti problem has cost taxpayers almost $200 million so far, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States has a special responsibility to move against brutal 
violations of human rights when they occur close to America's shores. "I know 
that the United States cannot, indeed we should not, be the world's policeman. 
. . . But when brutality occurs close to our shores it affects our national 
interest and we have a responsibility to act," he said, reciting in grim detail 
an increasingly murderous record that he blamed on the Haitian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States, dating back to the Administration of former President 
George Bush, has been committed to restoring Aristide to power; maintaining 
American credibility around the world requires it to follow through on its own 
commitments and to insist on compliance with commitments made to the United 
States by others. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that the United States "has strong interest in not letting 
dictators, especially in our own region, break their word to the United States 
and the United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal for public support at home, the President said U.S. military 
leaders have worked hard to minimize risks to American troops. "But the risks 
are there -- we must be prepared for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing concerns voiced by many Americans that U.S. troops might be bogged 
down in Haiti for a protracted period, Clinton declared that most of the 
invasion force would be returned home within a matter of months -- "not years." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they still think that there is a possibility 
that Cedras, Biamby and Francois will decide to leave the country at the last 
minute. Even if they do, U.S. forces would still enter Haiti to restore order 
and train a civilian-controlled security force to replace the thugs who now 
control the country, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. mission will be specific and limited, declared Clinton, who has been 
criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for refusing to seek congressional 
approval of the invasion. He compared the mission to the invasion of Grenada 
during the Ronald Reagan Administration and the invasion of Panama during the 
Bush Administration. Neither Reagan nor Bush sought congressional approval 
before acting. 
</P>
<P>
 And in describing the aftermath of the Haitian military coup, when the 
dictators launched "a horrible intimidation campaign of rape, torture and 
mutilation," he quoted then-President Bush as declaring that the situation 
posed "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy and economy of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the Haitian mission would be carried out in two phases. 
</P>
<P>
 First would come the removal of the military dictators from power and 
restoration of Aristide, who was chosen as president with almost 70% of the 
vote. Aristide served nine months before being overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Haitian security force that would "protect the people rather than 
repress them" had been trained, Clinton said, police monitors from other 
countries supporting the U.S. mission "will work with the authorities to 
maximize basic security and civil order and to minimize retribution." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second phase, he said, a much smaller U.S. force -- estimated at less 
than 3,000 by Administration officials -- will join forces with other U.N. 
contingents to help Haiti rebuild its society and move toward new elections 
next year. This contingent would be scheduled to leave Haiti after a new 
Haitian government takes office in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said Aristide, a controversial figure who some critics have described 
as radical and even unstable, has pledged to step down when his term as 
president ends next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The President spoke slowly and forcefully as he painted a graphic picture of a 
reign of terror conducted by "Cedras and his armed thugs, executing children, 
raping women, killing priests. As the dictators have grown more desperate, the 
atrocities have grown even more brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 International observers, he said, uncovered "a terrifying pattern of soldiers 
and policemen raping the wives and daughters of suspected political dissidents 
-- young girls -- 13, 16 years old -- people slain and mutilated, with body 
parts left as warnings to terrify others, children forced to watch as their 
mothers' faces are slashed with machetes." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's effort to explain his position to the public came none too soon, as 
opinion polls and scattered anti-invasion demonstrations made clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before Clinton's speech, Defense Secretary William J. Perry announced 
that about 1,600 military reservists will be called up for possible service in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Haitian dictators stand fast and Clinton orders the invasion, a quick 
military victory seems assured because Haiti's ragtag army of about 7,000 men 
would be hopelessly overmatched against the allied force of at least 20,000 
well-armed troops. But if there are substantial American casualties or 
embarrassing accidents caused by the fog of war, the operation could seem to be 
a defeat for the Administration even if all of the military objectives are 
ultimately met. 
</P>
<P>
 And it did not take long for the operation to produce an embarrassing mishap. 
A Navy fast patrol boat, the Monsoon, went aground on what the Navy said was an 
uncharted sandbar about two miles off the coast of Haiti. A Coast Guard vessel 
helped to free the Monsoon late Thursday. Wanted: Haiti's Outlaw Leaders 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has demanded that these three Haitian leaders step down. If 
they do not, he has vowed to send in American troops to oust them. 
</P>
<P>
 RAOUL CEDRAS 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Army commander 
</P>
<P>
 A reputed protege of the late dictator Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, Cedras is 
the son of a Duvalier official in the southeastern town of Jeremie. He 
graduated in 1973 from the Haitian military academy and was sent by Duvalier 
for training in the United States, Spain, Mexico and Taiwan. Duvalier's son and 
successor, Jean-Claude (Baby Doc), appointed him to the elite anti-guerrilla 
Leopards Corps. After the younger Duvalier fled into exile in 1986, Cedras was 
put in charge of security for the 1989 elections in which Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide was chosen president. Subsequently, Aristide appointed him interim 
commander-in-chief of the army. In September, 1991, Cedras headed the bloody 
coup that drove Aristide from the island. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHEL-JOSEPH FRANCOIS 
</P>
<P>
 POSITION: Port-au-Prince police chief 
</P>
<P>
 The notoriously secretive Francois is widely considered the mastermind of 
Haiti's ongoing wave of murderous repression. He himself denies that he even 
heads the capital's police force, claiming instead to be military commander of 
the capital district -- even though he wears a police uniform, carries a 
policeman's helmet and has his office in police headquarters. Son of an army 
major who served in palace security and was promoted by Francois Duvalier, he 
graduated in 1981 from the Haitian military academy, where he was a student of 
current army chief Cedras, and then attended the U.S. command school for 
foreign officers at Ft. Bragg, N.C. He reportedly had a major role in the 1991 
coup. His older brother, Evans, was once a professional diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
 PHILIPPE BIAMBY 
</P>
<P>
 POSITION: Army chief of staff 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cedras and Francois, Biamby is the son of a prominent member of the 
Francois Duvalier regime. His father was once defense and interior minister and 
also worked as the dictator's private secretary. Thought to be the most 
hard-line member of the triumvirate, Biamby graduated from Haiti's military 
academy in the same class as Cedras. In 1989, he led an unsuccessful coup 
against Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who was then president. Forced out of the 
military, he fled to the Dominican Republic and then to the United States, 
where he was arrested on immigration charges and spent six months in a New York 
immigration prison. After Aristide was overthrown, Cedras reinstated him almost 
immediately. He reportedly lives very austerely, sleeping either at the general 
headquarters or in the room at his mother's house he has had since he was a 
child.

4 OIL FIRMS SETTLE SUIT OVER DUMP; ENVIRONMENT: THEY AGREE TO PAY $18 MILLION 
FOR CLEANUP PREPARATION COSTS AT THE MCCOLL SITE IN FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that four oil companies have 
agreed to pay $18 million to settle a lawsuit over the long-delayed cleanup of 
a toxic waste dump created in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment by Shell Oil Co., Atlantic Richfield Co., Union Oil Co. of 
California and Texaco Inc. will reimburse the state and federal governments for 
past costs associated with preparing for the cleanup of the 22-acre McColl dump 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the settlement is a significant step in the complex litigation over 
the cleanup effort, the dispute over McColl is far from over. The oil companies 
are waging a countersuit to determine if the federal government should pay part 
of the cleanup costs that could reach $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. EPA is pleased the oil companies have recognized their 
responsibility at this site," Jeff Zelikson, the agency's regional hazardous 
waste management division director, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the oil companies will reimburse the government for the 
$18 million spent between 1980 and mid-1990 to secure the dump and explore 
cleanup options. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA deemed McColl a major toxic problem in 1979 and added it to the 
federal Superfund priority list of toxic cleanup sites in September, 1983. A 
fence has been built around the area and a security guard posted to keep out 
intruders while the debate continues over how to proceed with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a remote area in Fullerton, the site contains about 100,000 cubic yards 
of petroleum waste discarded in the 1940s, later to be covered by oil drilling 
muds and topsoil. Eventually, the area became part of the Los Coyotes Country 
Club golf course. In the 1970s, homes were built next to the golf course, and 
their buyers complained of strong odors that caused headaches, and black goo 
that oozed into their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, $13.25 million will go to the EPA and $4.75 million to 
the state to replenish the Superfund account. 
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement prevents the McColl site from becoming an expensive orphan 
that consumes millions of dollars from the state and federal treasuries," said 
William F. Soo Hoo, director of the California Department of Toxic Substances 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement figures, spelled out in a consent decree filed Thursday in Los 
Angeles, represent a compromise, according to EPA officials who said they 
originally sought $25 million from the oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Ritter, assistant regional counsel for EPA in San Francisco, said the 
agency is attempting to get McAuley LCX Corp., owner of Los Coyotes Country 
Club, to pay the $7-million difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlement negotiations between the EPA and the oil companies began after U.S. 
District Court ruled in September, 1993, that the oil companies were legally 
liable to pay for cleanup of the wastes that they deposited at McColl in World 
War II during the production of aviation fuel. Until then, the oil companies 
had denied responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Duchie, spokesman for the oil companies, said Thursday that the firms 
will proceed with a countersuit that contends that financial liability for the 
total cleanup should be shared by the federal government because the dump was 
created as part of the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchie said the oil companies agreed to put up funds for the past costs 
"because we want to move directly into the issue of what portion of liability 
can be assessed to the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal government is found partly responsible, Duchie said, the oil 
companies will seek to recover a portion of the $18 million that they have now 
pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the EPA has discarded a variety of proposed cleanup approaches 
-- including removal and incineration of the waste -- as too costly or 
hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, the EPA decided to go ahead with a plan to solidify and 
neutralize the waste by mixing it with a cement-like material, but feasibility 
studies of the process are still under way. Ritter said the oil companies, 
under orders from the EPA, are designing the clean-up effort. A large-scale 
field test of the procedures is scheduled in November.

JUDGE FREES FUGITIVE IRISH NATIONALIST; COURTS: JAMES JOSEPH SMYTH WOULD FACE 
PERSECUTION IN PRISON, FEDERAL JURIST RULES IN BARRING EXTRADITION TO BRITAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A federal judge Thursday refused to order the extradition of an Irish 
nationalist and prison escapee to Britain to complete his sentence for 
attempted murder, saying the man would face persecution because of his 
political views. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Barbara Caulfield ordered the immediate release of James 
Joseph Smyth from jail, where he has been held except for short intervals since 
his capture by federal agents in San Francisco in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on evidence of conditions in Northern Ireland and Smyth's past treatment 
in and out of prison, he would probably be in danger in prison and after his 
release, Caulfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "frequent stops, arrests, interrogations, beatings and searches of his 
home" to which Smyth was subjected as a known Irish nationalist are "a 
harbinger of things to come if Mr. Smyth returns to the streets of Northern 
Ireland," Caulfield wrote. She also quoted a prison warden as saying he could 
not guarantee Smyth's safety in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth was released from the federal prison at Dublin, Calif., about an hour 
after the ruling was issued, and he headed for a celebration at an Irish pub in 
San Francisco, according to one of his supporters, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth's case is a potential precedent-setter for other fugitives from Northern 
Ireland, including three fellow participants in a 1983 jailbreak now awaiting 
extradition hearings in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Caulfield is the first judge to interpret restrictions on extradition under a 
1986 treaty between the United States and Britain. The treaty bars extradition 
of anyone who would face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality 
or political opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 The British government, represented in the case by the U.S. Justice 
Department, has appealed every unfavorable ruling so far, and has twice won 
reversal of Caulfield's decisions freeing Smyth on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth, now 40, of Belfast, describes himself as an Irish nationalist and 
member of Sinn Fein, the political party affiliated with the Irish Republican 
Army, but says he is nonviolent and has never been an IRA member. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the 1977 attempted murder of an 
off-duty prison guard, in which he continues to maintain his innocence. In 
1983, he and 37 other men, all described by British authorities as terrorists 
or sympathizers, fled from the Maze prison near Belfast in the largest such 
escape in British history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly nine years later, Smyth was arrested in San Francisco, where he lived 
under an assumed name, was married and worked as a house painter. 
</P>
<P>
 At Smyth's trial, his lawyer demanded reports of police investigations into 
allegations that security forces had practiced a "shoot-to-kill" policy against 
suspected terrorists in the late 1970s. Citing security concerns, the British 
government refused to provide the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, the judge said she would presume that Catholic Irish 
nationalists such as Smyth, accused or convicted of crimes against security 
forces or government officials, were subjected to retaliation, physical 
intimidation and death, with the participation or endorsement of government 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several fugitives have recently been returned to the Maze without 
incident, the past treatment of Smyth and his fellow escapees suggests that he 
would be a target, Caulfield said.

OPEN-PRIMARY INITIATIVE PUT ON '96 BALLOT; POLITICS: MEASURE WOULD ALLOW 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR CANDIDATES OUTSIDE THEIR PARTIES. LEADERS 
ON BOTH SIDES CRITICIZE THE IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An open-primary initiative designed to allow Democrats to help select 
Republican nominees and vice versa has qualified for the March, 1996, ballot, 
but spokesmen for both major political parties are criticizing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading proponent, Sen. Tom Campbell (R-Stanford), calls for the open 
primary as a political reform measure. He says it would give voters wider 
choices, increase voter turnout and swing more votes to middle-of-the-road 
candidates who represent most Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as a moderate Republican, Campbell is the kind of politician who 
might benefit from the open primary by drawing votes from both major parties. 
Running only within his own party, Campbell narrowly lost the GOP nomination 
for U.S. senator in 1992 to conservative Bruce Herschensohn. 
</P>
<P>
 Another supporter of the initiative, political consultant Ron Smith, who 
helped qualify it for the ballot, said, "Many, many voters feel neither party 
represents them now, and they will be able to vote for the best person, 
regardless of party, under the open-primary system." Smith served as Campbell's 
U.S. Senate campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mulholland, a campaign adviser for the state Democratic Party, replied, 
"Primaries are for party members to vote for their own candidates. It's absurd 
to let non-members participate. I know the Lions Club doesn't let the Kiwanis 
Club vote in their elections, or vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 State GOP Executive Director John Peschong called the initiative a "bad idea" 
and questioned whether it would result in the best possible nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the initiative, all primary election candidates would appear on a 
uniform ballot provided to all registered voters. They could vote for any 
candidate, regardless of party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The top vote-getters in each party represented on the ballot would appear on 
the November general election ballot for a final decision by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 California now uses a similar system in special elections to fill state 
legislative vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller said the open-primary initiative might 
not survive a court challenge if it is approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts have held that political parties have extensive control over how 
they conduct their business," Miller said, "and it is unclear whether this 
measure would survive judicial scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should this measure not be ruled invalid by the courts, the impact that this 
change could have on the political process is immense, although difficult to 
measure at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Miller spokeswoman said she did not know how many other U.S. states conduct 
open primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 426,000 registered voters signed petitions to qualify the initiative 
for the ballot. Silicon Valley industrialist and GOP campaign contributor David 
Packard supplied $202,000 to help collect the names. Campbell's own campaign 
committee furnished a $25,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 California's 1996 primary election will be held in March instead of June 
because of a new state law that moved it up to give the state more clout in 
picking presidential nominees.

TOWN'S COUNCIL RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in the small resort town of Desert Hot Springs took out their anger 
over a 3% utility tax in wholesale fashion this week, recalling the entire 
five-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a thankless job," said Councilwoman Nancy Sappington, who had served on 
the council for only a year. "I'm taking it real hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The community of 14,000 will not be without a City Council, however. Three of 
the booted politicians -- Mayor Mike Segrist and Councilmen Phil Kerr and Dan 
Been -- will be allowed to serve out their regular terms until November. Both 
Segrist and Been were going to retire from public office anyway, and Kerr 
already is on the November ballot to run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two evicted members will hold their seats until a special election 
in January to select their successors. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall was sparked when the City Council last year proposed a 5% utility 
tax to help with the city's meager $3-million annual budget. Faced with recall 
petitions signed by about 1,500 voters, the council whittled the tax down to 3% 
and agreed to end it in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the recall movement moved forward, and on Tuesday, with a 23% voter 
turnout, about 60% of the ballots called for the ouster of the entire council 
-- though the number of votes to dump the council was only about half the 
number of people who signed the recall petition in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection left Sappington shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tax would have generated more than $650,000 for public safety and to 
improve senior services," she said. "People demand more services, but then 
they're unwilling to pay for it. It's a real dichotomy." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Faye Wiesmann, who had two years remaining on her term, was 
nonplussed -- being already on the November ballot for mayor, along with Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 "People told me they were going to vote for my recall as a way to warn the 
City Council, but that they're going to vote for me for mayor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Mayor Segrist shrugged off the recall as an unnecessary electoral 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ludicrous for them to recall me because I wasn't running for 
reelection," he said. "But I'm not upset. I understand the politics of the 
thing. And I've wanted to spend more time on my air-conditioning and heating 
business anyway."

SOUTHEAST ASIA; MALAY MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS FACE CRACKDOWN; GOVERNMENT SEEMS 
TO FEEL THREATENED BY SMALL SECT. OBSERVERS SUSPECT GROUP'S MESSAGE IS REAL 
CAUSE OF CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There is an eerily Middle Eastern aura to the scene of police with automatic 
weapons blockading a village of Muslim fundamentalists whose movement has been 
declared a security threat to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a suburb of prosperous Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, half a world away 
from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. And the government behind the effort to 
crush the group known as Al Arqam is itself Muslim; it takes pride in 
championing Islamic causes from Jerusalem to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus there remains an element of mystery about why Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohammed has moved so forcefully in the last two months to eradicate the 
influence of Al Arqam, a sect with 10,000 registered followers. 
</P>
<P>
 But most analysts agree that the move could have political repercussions for 
Malaysia that reach far beyond the sect's small numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown began Aug. 5, when Malaysia's National Fatwa Council, the 
protector of the Islamic faith for the country, ruled that Al Arqam was 
spreading "deviationist" teachings and was banned. The group was officially 
outlawed by the government Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 In an even stranger twist, the government on Sept. 2 revoked the passport of 
Al Arqam leader Ashaari Mohammed while he was in Thailand. He was deported by 
Thai police into Malaysia, where he was detained under the country's Draconian 
security laws, which allow indefinite detention without trial. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, seven members of Al Arqam have been detained in the most sweeping use 
of the security laws since a crackdown on opposition politicians in 1988. 
Hundreds, including more than 100 children, have been arrested on lesser 
charges during police raids. The group's schools and offices have been ordered 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials have told foreign journalists that the move was prompted 
by concerns that Al Arqam was evolving into something like the Branch Davidian 
sect in Waco, Tex., where dozens of people died in a confrontation with federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Al Arqam appears to lack any weapons or the numbers to pose a genuine 
security threat to the government, diplomatic analysts said they believed that 
Mahathir and his ruling party, the United Malay National Organization, may have 
been motivated more out of concern for the group's message than any actual 
threat it posed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government may have felt that Al Arqam was a competitor for the new, 
modern Malay," one diplomat said. "UMNO's Achilles' heel is hypocrisy and 
corruption, and Al Arqam is well-placed to exploit those issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Malays, virtually all Muslim, make up about 50% of the population of Malaysia 
-- making them the dominant political force in the country. Of the remainder, 
33% are ethnic Chinese and 10% are of Indian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Islamic religious party known as PAS, which governs the Malaysian 
state of Kelantan but is widely perceived as anti-development, Al Arqam has 
attracted a number of university-trained economists and specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement has set up a $120-million business conglomerate of 23 companies 
ranging from mini-markets to high-tech maintenance firms. Their devout 
employees are just the kind of people that UMNO wants to attract. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's adherents are eminently visible in secular Malaysia, with men 
often wearing turbans and long green robes similar to an Arab galabia , while 
the women are kept in purdah , swathed from head to toe in black.  
</P>
<P>
 While the group has so far stayed out of the political arena, Ashaari angered 
authorities by publishing details of a dream in which he claimed that the 
Prophet Mohammed made critical remarks about Mahathir. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be seen is whether ordinary Malays will be turned off by the 
government's heavy-handed efforts to suppress a Muslim organization, which many 
people regard as rather harmless if eccentric. Malaysia Fact Sheet

DIPLOMACY; GAP VISIBLE IN SUMMIT PLANS FOR HAVE, HAVE-NOT NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On paper, the idea shines with a brilliance that ought to attract President 
Clinton: Assemble all the leaders of the world in a U.N. conference dealing 
with the torment of the hundreds of millions of people falling by the wayside 
in an era of change. 
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats preparing for the World Social Summit -- or, as it is sometimes 
called, the People's Summit -- in Copenhagen in March are worried. 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that the planned session could turn into a North-South war of 
words -- continual rounds of acrimony between industrialized and developing 
countries. And if it does, U.S. officials hint, Clinton will probably not go. 
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats, who completed a preparatory meeting at U.N. headquarters in New 
York last month, will meet there again in January in hopes of working out an 
agenda to ensure a meaningful summit. U.S. officials were somewhat disappointed 
with the August meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few people came here with a firm agenda for the social summit," a State 
Department official said. "And a lot of rhetoric was puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the summit was advanced first by Patricio Aylwin, former 
president of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted a growing agreement on the political and economic roads that 
governments must take in the post-Cold War era: Democracy is the only real 
political choice, and free markets are the only real economic choice. 
</P>
<P>
 But he argued that no consensus is forming on the social choices that must be 
made in the post-Cold War era. Many people are confused and hesitant about what 
they ought to do about poverty, jobs, stagnant development, expanding gaps 
between the richest and the poorest, ethnic strife and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 A summit might come up with social solutions or, at least, the germ of them. 
But the subject is so vast and unwieldy that it lends itself to interminable, 
numbing talk and to idealistic proposals that have little chance of 
realization. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats, who support the idea of a social summit strongly, want the 
issues more focused and down-to-earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the chairmanship of Chile's ambassador to the United Nations, Juan 
Somavia, the preparatory committee did a good deal of rewriting in August its 
proposed "draft program of action" for the summit -- but, in the view of the 
Clinton Administration, not enough so far. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue centers simply on numbers and formulas. The draft program, for 
example, calls on industrialized nations to fulfill a U.N. goal of devoting 
0.7% of their gross national product to foreign aid for developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would mean increasing our development assistance from $8 billion a year 
to $45 billion a year," the State Department official said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials believe that the summit should focus on what can be done to 
develop poor nations without calling for spending boosts that few donor 
governments will accept. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans would prefer, instead, that the summit agree to change 
development programs so they concentrate on projects such as potable water, 
sanitation and universal education that help alleviate poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans also fear that developing countries might try to turn the summit 
into an exercise in bashing the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials agree that the bank's "structural adjustment" programs have 
gone awry. Under these programs, Third World governments must tighten their 
budgets, reduce government employment, eliminate food subsidies and devalue 
their currency before receiving World Bank and IMF loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The strictures are designed to improve the economies in the long run, but, in 
the short term, they increase unemployment and the cost of goods, causing 
hardship.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials fear that Third World governments want to put the World Bank 
and IMF under the control of the United Nations, where these governments have 
an overwhelming majority.

COVERT ACTION FAILS TO OUST HAITI'S RULERS; CARIBBEAN: CIA HAS TRIED TO RECRUIT 
OFFICERS TO UNDERMINE MILITARY RULERS. U.S. OFFICIALS SAY SECRET OPERATIONS 
WILL CONTINUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The CIA launched a major covert operation this month to try to topple Haiti's 
military regime without a full-scale U.S. invasion, but so far the attempt has 
failed, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret operation included an attempt to recruit officers in the Haitian 
armed forces to undermine the country's leaders, Lt. Gen Raoul Cedras, Brig. 
Gen. Philippe Biamby and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. agents were authorized to offer money, communications equipment and 
weapons to "friendly elements" in the military in hopes that their actions 
would provoke the collapse of the regime or at least weaken it severely. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers targeted included not only suspected political dissidents hidden 
inside the military but also what one source called "free-lancers" who might be 
motivated by money or a desire for power. 
</P>
<P>
 That attempt was only a part of what officials described as a broad effort to 
"destabilize" the military regime, which seized power from Haiti's elected 
president in 1991 and then defied U.S. and United Nations demands to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are using every means at our disposal to get rid of this regime in hopes 
of avoiding the necessity of an invasion," said one senior Clinton 
Administration official involved in Haiti policy. "Every means." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the secret operation has achieved no clear success, officials said. 
One source said the effort "was too late to make much difference." 
Nevertheless, the covert effort has not yet been abandoned, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters, without referring to the 
covert operation, that there was still some hope that Haiti's military might 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some number of reports from Haiti indicating a fair amount of 
turmoil in the ruling regime there, among individuals in the ruling regime," he 
said. "I wouldn't want to try to interpret the significance of those reports." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Administration aide said the Haitian military has proven more cohesive 
than U.S. intelligence officials initially expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen evidence of tension among (the top three Haitian leaders), but 
it hasn't led to anything yet," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to destabilize Haiti's military was approved by President Clinton, 
and a formal notification called a "finding" was delivered to eight leaders of 
Congress, as required by law, early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding authorized the CIA to spend up to $12 million on covert efforts in 
Haiti, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to destabilizing the military regime, the U.S. intelligence 
agencies were also authorized by the finding to spend an unspecified amount of 
money to move Cedras and his colleagues out of Haiti if they ask for the 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was not intended as a bribe, but as "transition or departure money," 
a source said. He said that the money is still available in a "contingency 
fund," in case it is needed for what he called "persuasion or facilitation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration appeared to be making a distinction between legitimate 
relocation expenses and plain boodle. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has sent several messages to Haiti's rulers offering a comfortable 
exile in South America or elsewhere. Officials said the Administration is 
willing to provide transportation, protection and assurances that the Haitians 
will not be prosecuted for their actions in power. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Haitians have not responded, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret operation was launched after months of conventional diplomatic 
efforts to stir discord in the Haitian armed forces -- and after months of 
pressure from members of Congress' intelligence committees to try something 
covert. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration spent months debating what kind of action to undertake, 
officials said, and what actions would be out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers at both the CIA and the Justice Department researched a long list of 
possible actions to determine whether they would be legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other limits, Administration officials said they were strictly observing 
a longstanding prohibition against promoting the assassination of any foreign 
leader.

U.S. SOUNDS A WARNING; U.S. MUST 'STOP THE BRUTAL ATROCITIES' IN HAITI, CLINTON 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is the text of President Clinton's televised speech about Haiti: 
</P>
<P>
 My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about why the United 
States is leading the international effort to restore democratic government in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's dictators, led by (Lt.) Gen. Raoul Cedras, control the most violent 
regime in our hemisphere. For three years, they have rejected every peaceful 
solution that the international community has proposed. They have broken an 
agreement that they made to give up power. They have brutalized their people 
and destroyed their economy. And for three years, we and other nations have 
worked exhaustively to find a diplomatic solution, only to have the dictators 
reject each one. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the United States must protect our interests, to stop the brutal 
atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians, to secure our borders, 
and to preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere, and to 
uphold the reliability of the commitments we make and the commitments others 
make to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier today, I ordered Secretary of Defense (William J.) Perry to call up 
the military reserve personnel necessary to support United States troops in any 
action we might undertake in Haiti. I have also ordered two aircraft carriers 
-- the USS Eisenhower and the USS America -- into the region. I issued these 
orders after giving full consideration to what is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The message of the United States to the Haitian dictators is clear: Your time 
is up. Leave now, or we will force you from power. 
</P>
<P>
 I want the American people to understand the background of the situation in 
Haiti, how what has happened there affects our national security interests and 
why I believe we must act now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 200 years ago, the Haitian people rose up out of slavery and declared 
their independence. Unfortunately, the promise of liberty was quickly snuffed 
out, and ever since, Haiti has known more suffering and repression than 
freedom. In our time, as democracy has spread throughout our hemisphere, Haiti 
has been left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just four years ago, the Haitian people held the first free and fair 
elections since their independence. They elected a parliament and a new 
president -- Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a Catholic priest who received 
almost 70% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But eight months later, Haitian dreams of democracy became a nightmare of 
bloodshed. Gen. Raoul Cedras led a military coup that overthrew President 
Aristide, the man who had appointed Cedras to lead the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Resisters were beaten and murdered. The dictators launched a horrible 
intimidation campaign of rape, torture and mutilation. People starved, children 
died, thousands of Haitians fled their country, heading to the United States 
across dangerous seas. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, President (George) Bush declared the situation posed, and I 
quote, "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy and economy of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign of terror, executing 
children, raping women, killing priests. As the dictators have grown more 
desperate, the atrocities have grown ever more brutal. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent news reports have documented the slaying of Haitian orphans by the 
nation's deadly police thugs. The dictators are said to suspect the children of 
harboring sympathy toward President Aristide, for no other reason than he ran 
an orphanage in his days as a parish priest. The children fled the orphanages 
for the streets, now they can't even sleep there because they are so afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 As one young boy told a visitor, "I do not care if the police kill me, because 
it only brings an end to my suffering." A Terrifying Pattern' 
</P>
<P>
 International observers uncovered a terrifying pattern of soldiers and 
policemen raping the wives and daughters of suspected political dissidents -- 
young girls, 13, 16 years old -- people slain and mutilated with body parts 
left as warnings to terrify others; children forced to watch as their mothers' 
faces are slashed with machetes. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago the dictators assassinated the minister of justice. Just last month 
they gunned down Father Jean-Marie Vincent, a peasant leader and close friend 
of Father Aristide. Vincent was executed on the doorstep of his home, a 
monastery. He refused to give up his ministry, and for that he was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me be clear, Gen. Cedras and his accomplices alone are responsible for 
this suffering and terrible human tragedy. It is their actions that have 
isolated Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the international community nor the United States has sought a 
confrontation. For nearly three years, we've worked hard on diplomatic efforts. 
The United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Caribbean 
Community, the six Central American presidents -- all have sought a peaceful 
end to this crisis. We have tried everything -- persuasion and negotiation, 
mediation and condemnation. Emissaries were dispatched to Port-au-Prince and 
were turned away. The United Nations labored for months to reach an agreement 
acceptable to all parties.  
</P>
<P>
 Then last year Gen. Cedras himself came here to the United States and signed 
an agreement on Governors Island in New York in which he pledged to give up 
power along with the other dictators. But when the day came for the plan to 
take effect, the dictators refused to leave and instead increased the brutality 
they are using to cling to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, the nations of the world continued to seek a peaceful solution 
while strengthening the embargo we had imposed. We sent massive amounts of 
humanitarian aid, food for a million Haitians and medicine, to try to help the 
ordinary Haitian people as the dictators continued to loot the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then this summer they threw out the international observers who had blown the 
whistle on the regime's human rights atrocities. In response to that action, in 
July the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution that authorizes 
the use of all necessary means, including force, to remove the Haitian 
dictators from power and restore democratic government. Still, we continued to 
seek a peaceful solution, but the dictators would not even meet with the United 
Nations special envoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of this continued defiance and with atrocities rising, the United 
States has agreed to lead a multinational force to carry out the will of the 
United Nations. More than 20 countries from around the globe -- including 
almost all the Caribbean Community and nations from as far away as Poland, 
which has so recently won its own freedom; Israel and Jordan, which have been 
struggling for decades to preserve their own security; and Bangladesh, a 
country working on its own economic problems -- have joined nations like 
Belgium and Great Britain. They have all agreed to join us because they think 
this problem in our neighborhood is important to their future interests and 
their security. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that the United States cannot, indeed we should not, be the world's 
policeman, and I know this is a time, with the Cold War over, that so many 
Americans are reluctant to commit military resources and our personnel beyond 
our borders. But when brutality occurs close to our shores it affects our 
national interest and we have a responsibility to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Haitians have already fled toward the United States, risking 
their lives to escape the reign of terror. As long as Cedras rules, Haitians 
will continue to seek sanctuary in our nation. This year, in less than two 
months, more than 21,000 Haitians were rescued at sea by our Coast Guard and 
Navy. Today, more than 14,000 refugees are living at our naval base in 
Guantanamo. The American people have already expended almost $200 million to 
support them, to maintain the economic embargo, and the prospect of millions 
and millions more being spent every month for an indefinite period of time loom 
ahead unless we act. Three hundred thousand more Haitians, 5% of their entire 
population, are in hiding in their own country. If we don't act, they could be 
the next wave of refugees at our door. We will continue to face the threat of a 
mass exodus of refugees and its constant threat to stability in our region and 
control of our borders. Tide of Migrants' 
</P>
<P>
 No American should be surprised that the recent tide of migrants seeking 
refuge on our shores comes from Haiti and from Cuba. After all, they are the 
only nations left in the Western Hemisphere where democratic government is 
denied, the only countries where dictators have managed to hold back the wave 
of democracy and progress that has swept over our entire region, and that our 
own government has so actively promoted and supported for years. Today, 33 of 
the 35 countries in the Americas have democratically elected leaders, and Haiti 
is the only nation in our hemisphere where the people actually elected their 
own government and chose democracy, only to have tyrants steal it away. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the Haitian people want to embrace democracy; we 
know it because they went to the ballot box and told the world. 
</P>
<P>
 History has taught us that preserving democracy in our own hemisphere 
strengthens America's security and prosperity. Democracies here are more likely 
to keep the peace and to stabilize our region. They are more likely to create 
free markets and economic opportunity, and to become strong, reliable trading 
partners, and they are more likely to provide their own people with the 
opportunities which will encourage them to stay in their nation and to build 
their own futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring Haiti's democratic government will help lead to more stability and 
prosperity in our region, just as our actions in Panama and Grenada did. Beyond 
the human rights violations, the immigration problems, the importance of 
democracy, the United States also has strong interest in not letting dictators, 
especially in our own region, break their word to the United States and the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the post Cold War world we will assure the security and prosperity of the 
United States with our military strength, our economic power, our constant 
efforts to promote peace and growth. But when our national security interests 
are threatened, we will use diplomacy when possible, and force when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, we have a case in which the right is clear, in which the country in 
question is nearby, in which our own interests are plain, in which the mission 
is achievable and limited, and in which the nations of the world stand with us. 
We must act. 
</P>
<P>
 Our mission in Haiti, as it was in Panama and Grenada, will be limited and 
specific. Our plan to remove the dictators will follow two phases. First, it 
will remove dictators from power and restore Haiti's legitimate, democratically 
elected government. We will train a civilian-controlled Haitian security force 
that will protect the people rather than repress them. During this period, 
police monitors from all around the world will work with the authorities to 
maximize basic security and civil order, and minimize retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian people should know that we come in peace. And you, the American 
people should know, that our soldiers will not be involved in rebuilding Haiti 
or its economy. The international community, working together, must provide 
that economic, humanitarian, and technical assistance necessary to help the 
Haitians rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 When this first phase is completed, the vast majority of our troops will come 
home, in months, not years. I want our troops and their families to know that 
we will bring them home just as soon as we possibly can. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the second phase, a much smaller U.S. force will join forces from 
other members of the United Nations, and their mission will leave Haiti after 
elections are held next year and a new Haitian government takes office in early 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, I can announce that President Aristide has pledged to step down when 
his term ends in accordance with the constitution he has sworn to upheld. He 
has committed himself to promote reconciliation among all Haitians and to set a 
historic example by peacefully transferring power to a duly elected successor. 
He knows, as we know, that when you start a democracy, the most important 
election is the second election. President Aristide has told me that he will 
consider his mission fulfilled not when he regains office, but when he leaves 
office to the next democratically elected president of Haiti. He has pledged to 
honor the Haitian voters who put their faith in the ballot box. 'Soldiers at 
Risk' 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, let me say that I know the American people are rightfully 
concerned whenever our soldiers are put at risk. Our volunteer military is the 
world's finest, and its leaders have worked hard to minimize risks to all our 
forces. But the risks are there, and we must be prepared for that. I assure you 
that no President makes decisions like this one without deep thought and 
prayer, but it's my job as President and commander in chief to take those 
actions that I believe will best protect our national security interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me say again, the nations of the world have tried every possible way to 
restore Haiti's democratic government peacefully. The dictators have rejected 
every possible solution. The terror, the desperation, and the instability will 
not end until they leave. Once again, I urge them to do so. They can still move 
now and reduce the chaos and disorder, increase the security, the stability and 
the safety in which this transfer back to democracy can occur. But if they do 
not leave now, the international community will act to honor our commitments to 
give democracy a chance, not to guarantee it; to remove stubborn and cruel 
dictators, not to impose a future. 
</P>
<P>
 I know many people believe that we shouldn't help the Haitian people recover 
their democracy and find their hard-won freedoms, that the Haitians should 
accept the violence and repression as their fate. But, remember, the same was 
said of a people who more than 200 years ago took up arms against a tyrant 
whose forces occupied their land, but they were a stubborn bunch, a people who 
fought for their freedoms and appealed to all those who believed in democracy 
to help their cause. And their cries were answered, and a new nation was born, 
a nation that ever since has believed that the rights of life, liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness should be denied to none. 
</P>
<P>
 May God bless the people of the United States and the cause of freedom. Good 
night.

HISTORY SUGGESTS CLINTON RUNS A RISK NOT SEEKING CONGRESS' OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In claiming the authority to invade Haiti without congressional approval or 
even much debate, President Clinton is following a road traveled by most of his 
postwar predecessors, often at great cost to their presidencies and the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he (Clinton) hasn't got congressional backing, he has no political 
cover at all," points out American University presidential scholar Allan J. 
Lichtman about the assault the President foreshadowed in his televised address 
Thursday night. "That means if things go wrong, he will get all the blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently things have gone wrong, as they did for another Democratic 
President, Harry S. Truman, when he sent U.S. troops into Korea without 
consulting Congress. To minimize the U.S. commitment, Truman referred to the 
conflict as a "police action," but it turned into a prolonged and bloody 
struggle that cast a pall over his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that some Administration officials have been referring to a 
contemplated assault on Haiti as a police action, Truman biographer Alonzo 
Hamby said: "For a Democratic Administration to use that phrase is like talking 
about rope in the home of someone who has been hanged." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Truman's Korean venture, Hamby said: "It would have been better if he had 
gotten congressional approval. At the end of the day, Congress would have 
supported him, and at least he would have been able to say: 'This is not 
something I went into myself like some bullheaded Missouri mule.' 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the value of congressional endorsement, President Lyndon B. Johnson 
prodded lawmakers into passing the 1964 Tonkin Gulf Resolution giving him a 
hazy grant of authority for combatting aggression in Southeast Asia. But he 
never got explicit congressional or public backing for his massive escalation 
of the war, which divided the nation so badly that it forced him to abandon his 
hopes of reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 No strangers to political realities themselves, says Duke University law 
professor William Van Alstyne, the Founding Fathers took politics into 
consideration when they framed the war powers section of the Constitution, 
which reserved for Congress the right to declare war. Van Alstyne is one of a 
group of 10 constitutional scholars who have petitioned Clinton, urging him to 
seek congressional approval before launching an attack on Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The records of the Constitutional Convention show that its architects wanted 
to avoid the consequences at home and abroad of "a divided nation going to 
war," Van Alstyne said. "When Congress is convened and the President presents 
his case and gets approval to launch an attack, that lends both authority and 
credibility to what the U.S. intends to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting congressional support also protects the President on the domestic 
front, Van Alstyne contended. "Once you go into war, you don't want the 
prospect of members of Congress who stay silent so they can calculate the odds 
after the fact and then insist that this is what should have been done all 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not all unilateral actions by Presidents abroad turn out to be 
disasters. The lightning-swift conquest of Grenada ordered in 1983 by President 
Ronald Reagan, who claimed the Caribbean isle was being transformed into a 
launching pad for aggression by Fidel Castro's Cuba, boosted Reagan's standing 
in the polls. It was also credited with fostering an overall revival of 
patriotism in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan did not get congressional approval, claiming after the action that 
public debate would have jeopardized several hundred American medical students 
on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, President John F. Kennedy's handling of the Cuban missile crisis, 
which brought the United States to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet 
Union without congressional involvement, was a triumph for him both at home and 
abroad. But conscious of the great risk Kennedy took, former Secretary of State 
Dean Acheson, one of the small circle of advisers consulted by Kennedy during 
the crisis, later confided to friends that he thought the President had been 
reckless. According to historian Alan Brinkley, Acheson privately offered this 
verdict on Kennedy's management of the crisis: "Plain dumb luck."  
</P>
<P>
 Even if Clinton is just as fortunate in the initial confrontation with Haiti's 
puny armed forces, in the aftermath of the invasion the United States will face 
the problems of restoring and maintaining civil order and putting the Haitian 
economy on a working basis. These tasks could lead to political problems back 
home, biographer Hamby warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "All sorts of things could happen to make this a very long military commitment 
and a very open-ended economic commitment," he said. "In effect, we would be 
adopting Haiti as a protectorate. This could turn into the greatest social 
welfare problem the Clinton Administration has to face." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some Presidents have benefited from dramatic events abroad 
because of the tendency of Americans to rally around the flag during such 
crises. Any such boost would come in handy right now for Democrats in the midst 
of an election campaign with most of the portents against them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans already have served notice that they will challenge any 
attempt by Democrats to gain political credit from a Haitian invasion.  
</P>
<P>
 "The overwhelming majority of Americans do not want the U.S. by itself or in 
concert with anybody else to invade Haiti," GOP National Chairman Haley Barbour 
recently declared. "There is no good public-policy reason to invade Haiti. The 
U.S. has no national security interest in Haiti. There is no excuse for 
invading Haiti. If they (Democrats) think invading Haiti is going to help them 
politically, they need to rethink that position." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence suggests that politics often plays a part when Presidents take 
military action abroad, even if they claim to be motivated solely by national 
security interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower dispatched 15,000 Marines to 
Lebanon amid civil unrest, he claimed that the tiny country was vulnerable to 
Communist takeover. But Eisenhower biographer Stephen Ambrose wrote that Ike 
also had a political motive: He wanted to rebut Democratic criticism that the 
U.S. defense Establishment was top-heavy with strategic weapons and lacking in 
the flexibility to wage brush-fire wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, scholars said that Clinton's Democratic predecessors, Truman and 
Johnson, hoped U.S. involvement in Korea and Vietnam would refute Republican 
charges that Democrats were soft on communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Cold War is over, Clinton also apparently has something to prove in 
Haiti. He has been under constant attack by Republicans for waffling on foreign 
affairs, and his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, recently was said to 
list the need to bolster U.S. credibility abroad as among the reasons for the 
Haiti invasion.

WEIGHT OF CLINTON SPEECH REMAINS TO BE SEEN ON CAPITOL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's speech about Haiti on Thursday night only partly mollified 
Democratic lawmakers who have complained that he was not doing nearly enough to 
convince the American people of the need to invade Haiti and oust its military 
junta. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they praised his speech as forceful and eloquent, even some of the 
President's closest congressional allies said he had failed to persuade them 
that he was on the right course. 
</P>
<P>
 While Republicans who have strongly opposed the invasion said Clinton had not 
made a case for intervening in Haiti, Democrats gave him high marks for what 
Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a senior member of the House Democratic 
leadership, said was "a good, strong speech" that showed Clinton's "guts and 
strong convictions on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But echoing the view of most Democrats in Congress, Richardson agreed with the 
President's critics that a compelling case for the need to risk American lives 
in Haiti had not been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regrettably, as much as many of us would like to support him, he (Clinton) 
hasn't made the case for an invasion yet and there is no strategic American 
interest at stake to justify it," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton "did a better job tonight than he has done so far" in laying out the 
rationale for an invasion, added Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the 
Senate subcommittee that appropriates foreign aid. But Leahy also said he 
regarded the speech as an effort that is "too little" and comes "too late" to 
persuade either Congress or the public to support an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, predictably, panned the speech as unconvincing and renewed their 
calls for a congressional vote on using force in Haiti before an invasion 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP lawmakers also seized on Clinton's disclosure that a small U.S. force 
would probably have to remain in Haiti until early 1996 to help oversee new 
elections as an admission that the American commitment to Haiti would be long 
and costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is going to commit U.S. troops to Haiti for up to two years . . 
. and I really fear for their lives because I think their presence is going to 
be resented by the Haitians," said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

BLACK CAUCUS SPLIT ON INVASION; MANY EXPRESS RESERVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exercising its legislative clout, the Congressional Black Caucus succeeded 
last spring in persuading President Clinton to focus more aggressively on 
restoring democracy to Haiti. Since then, however, Clinton has been less 
successful in persuading the caucus that Haitian democracy is worth the loss of 
American life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one measure of the lack of congressional support for a U.S. invasion of 
Haiti that even the 38 members of the Black Caucus, who earlier criticized 
Clinton for not acting forcefully enough to oust the Haitian military junta, 
are now almost evenly divided over the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional anti-war sentiment of many of its members, strong opposition 
by many of their constituents and the fear -- shared by most members of 
Congress -- that restoring democracy to Haiti will entail a long and costly 
commitment by U.S. forces instead have convinced many caucus members that the 
President has "embraced our cause somewhat too enthusiastically," according to 
one member who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caucus is united on restoring democracy to Haiti but is divided over how 
to do it," said Dan Wilson, a spokesman for Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), the 
group's chairman, who says that an invasion at this time is premature. "A few 
members are still undecided, but right now it's close to being an even split." 
</P>
<P>
 Members acknowledge that, after criticizing Clinton for ignoring Haiti, their 
failure to support him now has exposed the caucus to criticism from the 
President's allies.

PERSISTENT FIGHTING IN SOMALIA FORCES OUT LAST U.S. ENVOYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The last American diplomats in Somalia lowered the flag at their compound 
Thursday and left the country, conceding that persistent fighting made their 
job too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Their departure comes almost two years after the first U.S. troops arrived to 
help Somalia recover from famine and anarchy.Many lives were saved by the 
relief operation, but it soured as Somali warlords turned on Americans and the 
U.S. public lost faith that peace could be brought to the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine guards turned over security to U.N. troops and left Thursday morning 
for Mombasa, Kenya, said a U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 All the American diplomats at the liaison office in Mogadishu, including 
Ambassador Daniel Simpson, were sent to Nairobi, Kenya, said diplomatic sources 
in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the United States may send American combat troops back into Somalia 
to protect U.N. peacekeeping forces as they withdraw, U.S. and U.N. officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations has formally asked the United States for military aircraft 
and vessels to help carry its troops away from Somalia, officials from both 
sides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has reached no decision on the requests, U.S. officials 
said.

JAPAN SAYS IT WILL MAKE GOOD ON VOW TO PAY FOR U.S. TROOP SUPPORT; ASIA: 
STATEMENT MAY SETTLE DISPUTE OVER $300-MILLION INCREASE PROMISED FOR COSTS OF 
UTILITIES, CIVILIANS WORKING ON AMERICAN BASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to head off a contretemps between Washington and Tokyo, Japanese 
Defense Minister Tokuichiro Tamazawa said Thursday that Japan will make a 
"maximum effort" to pay the United States the additional money it earlier had 
promised for the support of American troops stationed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, to the consternation of American military planners, the Japanese 
Defense Agency has budgeted for only half of the $300-million increase it was 
scheduled to pay the United States next year as "host-nation support" for 
American forces. Under an agreement worked out in 1991, Japan was supposed to 
assume the full costs next year of more than 22,000 Japanese civilians who work 
on American military bases, as well as the bases' utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is important, because any dispute over the costs of the bases could 
affect the close security relationship between the United States and Japan. 
Despite the frequent economic frictions between the two countries and the 
recent political upheavals in Japan, Washington and Tokyo have managed to avoid 
any major change in the military alliance that prevailed during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamazawa, who met in Washington on Thursday with Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry and Vice President Al Gore, insisted that the new Japanese government 
headed by Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama eventually will be able to 
pay more for the U.S. troops than is now earmarked for the budget. Japanese 
government ministries will be reviewing the issue during the next few months, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to ask the United States to please watch and see what will 
happen," he explained in an interview with The Times and with the Yomiuri 
Shimbun, one of Japan's leading newspapers. He did not specify how much more 
Japan will pay and did not say whether it will contribute all the money 
originally promised. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Japan is spending about $2.5 billion in host-nation support to 
offset the costs of the 44,000 American troops on its soil. That sum includes 
75% of both the utility bills on the bases and the salaries of Japanese workers 
there. Under the earlier agreement, Japan's share of these costs was supposed 
to go up to 100% in the next fiscal year, which begins in April, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Japanese Defense Agency was told this summer that its overall budget, 
which is about $47 billion this year, can increase by no more than 0.9% next 
year. And defense officials decided that the scheduled payments to the 
Americans might have to be scaled back along with Japan's other defense costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were of course very concerned about not lowering the level of (Japanese) 
defense," Tamazawa said Thursday. "And at the same time we were interested in 
paying (the United States) for the labor costs" of Japanese workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion that Japan's payments to the United States might be as much as 
$150 million lower than expected raised some fears about how U.S. military 
forces in Asia might be affected. Richard Macke, the commander of U.S. forces 
in the Pacific, visited Tokyo for top-level meetings last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Tamazawa also contended that Japan should be granted a 
permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, without taking part in 
any U.N. peacekeeping operations that would involve military conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan recently agreed to send Japanese troops to provide humanitarian aid to 
Rwandan refugees in Zaire. But it did so only after repeatedly delaying the 
departure of the troops and forbidding them to enter Rwanda because there is no 
cease-fire there. 
</P>
<P>
 Some American officials have argued that it is unfair for Japan to insist on 
terms for Security Council membership in which U.S. forces might be forced to 
shed blood in U.N. peacekeeping operations, while Japanese forces would be 
freed from any similar danger. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense minister said that Japan is worried about being forced to 
comply with a U.N. resolution in which it would be required to send its troops 
for a peacekeeping operation somewhere in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Russia and China, which now have two of the five permanent seats 
on the Security Council, have not sent their forces abroad on peacekeeping 
missions.

RUSSIA'S NEW REVOLUTION: LIBEL SUITS; LITIGATION: POLITICAL BAD BOY VLADIMIR V. 
ZHIRINOVSKY WINS AN AWARD FOR BEING CALLED A 'FASCIST.' OTHERS ARE TAKING THEIR 
FIGHTS OUT OF THE STREETS AND INTO THE COURTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after President Boris N. Yeltsin dissolved Parliament, triggering a 
bloody revolt that left 143 people dead, the libel suit has replaced the 
Kalashnikov rifle as the chief instrument of political struggle in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky won a libel 
suit against Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of Yeltsin's free-market economic 
reforms, who had called Zhirinovsky "the most popular fascist" in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing evidence that included Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf," 
Zhirinovsky's book, "The Last Dash South," and the Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 
a Moscow municipal court ruled that Zhirinovsky had been wronged. 
</P>
<P>
 The three judges ordered Gaidar and his publisher, the newspaper Izvestia, to 
pay 1 million rubles in damages. The award was worth $435 at Thursday's 
exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In another courtroom on the other side of Moscow, a leader of the old 
Parliament also won a minor victory Thursday in a libel suit against his old 
enemy, Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the English- and French-language editions of his new biography, "The 
Struggle for Russia," Yeltsin writes that the "fascist" Iona I. Andronov would 
likely have been appointed foreign minister had the October, 1993, uprising by 
hard-liners succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has not forgotten the 20 million or more Soviet citizens who perished 
during World War II, and calling someone a fascist here is like branding him a 
Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
 Andronov, who lost much of his family to starvation during the Nazi siege of 
Leningrad, immediately filed suit against Yeltsin and his three Western 
publishers, including Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 "For my whole life, fascists have meant scum to me," he said. "There can be no 
worse insult." 
</P>
<P>
 The British publisher Harper Collins has already apologized to Andronov and 
promised to correct the error in future editions, according to a letter 
Andronov said he received from the publisher's solicitors. In the Russian 
edition of the memoirs, Andronov is described as a "militarist." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the 60-year-old former foreign correspondent marched out of a 
courthouse on Partisan Street in Kuntsevo, the district in western Moscow where 
Yeltsin lives, with a summons for the president or his representatives to 
appear in court.  
</P>
<P>
 If Yeltsin fails to show up, Andronov said, it will mean "he is not only a 
slanderer, but a coward as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The president's press service had no comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 That Russia's vitriolic ideological battles are being waged in court instead 
of on the streets represents a great leap forward from a year ago, when mobs of 
nationalists and Communists brawled with riot police, and Yeltsin sent tanks to 
bombard the White House Parliament building. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Yeltsin is on cordial terms with the new Parliament elected nine months 
ago, and the crowds that gather on Moscow streets are there to buy and sell 
stock shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian economy, though frighteningly feeble, appears to be stabilizing. 
Inflation was 4.1% in August, the lowest rate since reforms began in 1992. And 
the average Russian monthly wage jumped to about $116, a 46% increase since 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many Russians remain disillusioned with Yeltsin for using tanks to fight 
his political battles, and disgusted at their government's seeming inability to 
curb crime, corruption and the growing inequality between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The malaise is evident in recent public opinion polls, such as a Vesti 
television survey that found that only 19% of respondents considered Russia's 
leaders to be democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no Soviet leader would have allowed a political enemy to drag him into 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Now political foes of all stripes are routinely resorting to lawsuits to 
defend their honor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not hard to win, as the burden of proof is on the defendant. For 
example, the mayor of Moscow, Yuri M. Lushkov, won a slander suit last year 
against former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who had said city officials 
were building themselves dachas with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev could not furnish proof of Lushkov's alleged corruption, and he 
lost. He was ordered to apologize and fined the equivalent of 3 cents for 
failure to show up in court. Lushkov won at least eight other libel suits last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Zhirinovsky case, the court found that Gaidar had not managed to prove 
that the bad boy of Russian politics was really "the most popular fascist" in 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel rejected a last-minute attempt to introduce 
Zhirinovksy's statements about Hitler into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The court found that Zhirinovsky, leader of the largest party in the Russian 
Duma, the lower house of Parliament, had suffered "moral damage" as a result of 
Gaidar's article, an analysis of Zhirinovsky's ideology that was published in 
May. Izvestia was also ordered to print a retraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar's lawyer, Genry Reznik, said he would appeal the decision.

WILDER BOWS OUT OF VIRGINIA SENATE RACE; POLITICS: DEMOCRATS HOPE THE END OF 
EX-GOVERNOR'S INDEPENDENT CANDIDACY WILL HELP SEN. ROBB, WHO'S IN A CLOSE RACE 
WITH OLIVER NORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder withdrew from the U.S. Senate race in 
Virginia on Thursday, potentially giving a substantial boost to incumbent 
Democrat Charles S. Robb's efforts to keep his Senate seat in his race against 
Republican Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic powerbrokers, including Vice President Al Gore, and personal 
friends of the state's first black governor had passionately urged Wilder -- a 
Democrat who had been running as an independent -- to give up his bid for the 
sake of the party, which is struggling to retain control of the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen that the two-party system in Virginia is strong and that the 
difficulty in financing independent candidacies is real," Wilder said in a 
statement. "I am a realist," he added. "I know when to hold them and when to 
fold them." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement appears to have shifted the balance in the close race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday North was a narrow favorite, today Robb is a narrow favorite," said 
Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of Virginia.  
</P>
<P>
 But both candidates have their problems with the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb, Sabato said, is "seen as having a relatively weak record and being 
closely tied to Clinton, who is enormously unpopular in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb's admitted extramarital relationships do not help him either, Sabato 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But negative sentiment is not as strong against Robb as it is against North. A 
recent poll showed that 41% of those voters in the state who are undecided 
considered North an unacceptable choice, while 28% saw Robb that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many voters, their evaluation of Oliver North starts and ends with 
Iran-Contra," said John McGlennon, a professor of political science at the 
College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. "Almost half of the voters say 
under no circumstance would they vote for North." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb seemed to be buoyed by the news of Wilder's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Wilder is a formidable candidate, a formidable campaigner and 
adversary," Robb said while touring an elementary school in Alexandria, 
according to the Associated Press. "And having him no longer on the other side 
gives me an opportunity to bring together all the pieces of the Democratic 
coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls have shown North and Robb each with support from about one-third 
of those interviewed. Wilder had the support of 12% to 13% of the electorate, 
according to a poll taken shortly before his withdrawal. Republican J. Marshall 
Coleman, also running as an independent, had a slightly smaller share. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans in the state predicted that Wilder's withdrawal will not have 
much impact on the Robb-North race. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Johnson, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia said 
Wilder and Coleman "were fast becoming irrelevant."  
</P>
<P>
 Robb is likely to pick up support from African Americans, who make up about 
18% of the electorate, both because of his record as governor and because of 
his late father-in-law, former President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a champion 
of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were already starting to move in the direction of Sen. Robb," McGlennon 
said. "Now it will be much easier for him to get the solid backing of African 
American voters."

CUBANS' DETENTION NOW A STALEMATE; REFUGEES: THE U.S. IS PREPARED FOR AN 
INDEFINITE WAREHOUSING OF WOULD-BE MIGRANTS WHO WILL LIKELY RESIST THE BITTER 
OPTION OF RETURNING TO FACE CASTRO.

<P>
 Safely rescued from the roiling Straits of Florida, Douglas Suarez, a 
26-year-old leather artisan from Havana, posed two simple questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long will they keep us at the military base?" he asked as he and scores 
of other exhausted balseros (rafters) reposed on the salt-sprayed deck of a 
Coast Guard cutter earlier this week after their harrowing journeys from Cuba. 
And: "When can we go to the United States?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seems to have answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus of Cuban rafters appears to have ended after Cuban President Fidel 
Castro's decision this week to resume enforcement of his ban on irregular 
exits. In return, Washington has agreed to boost legal immigration slots for 
Cubans who apply at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 But Suarez's pointed questions -- repeated by scores of other rescued rafters 
-- continue to resonate in the White House amid a Cuban American community that 
says it has been betrayed and at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 
abruptly transformed into a throbbing migrant way station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon seems to have withstood the initial logistics challenge and 
provided sufficient food, clothing and shelter for the migrants, though several 
disturbances have already broken out and many believe that additional unrest is 
inevitable. Brig. Gen. Michael J. Williams, who heads the task force overseeing 
the operation, called conditions "not good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban detainee population on Guantanamo is expected to peak today at more 
than 30,000. As many as 10,000 migrants are slated to be transferred to new 
camps at a U.S. military facility near the Panama Canal. A few hundred 
eventually may elect to resettle with family members in Mexico, Venezuela or 
other countries with substantial Cuban communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Guantanamo's other migrants, about 14,000 Haitians, are expected to 
return voluntarily to their homeland once that island's military rulers are 
removed, by persuasion or invasion. But Castro, now facing off with the ninth 
U.S. President during his 35-year reign, does not appear to be going anywhere 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 And few of his former subjects on Guantanamo relish the thought of returning 
to a bankrupt police state where an average month's pay in pesos will not even 
buy a chicken but where tourists and others with access to dollars can enjoy 
relative luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never going back," declared Romel Rivera Despaigne, a 54-year-old 
grandfather from Santiago de Cuba, who was among those interviewed last week 
beneath an olive-drab tent at one dusty Guantanamo encampment. "I'll go to 
another country if I have to, but not to Cuba again." 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, members of the politically powerful Cuban exile lobby -- enraged 
by a detention policy that reversed three decades of favorable treatment for 
anyone fleeing Cuba -- have demanded the release of detainees to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration, fearing any step that might spark a new 
exodus, seems determined not to retreat from its policy of indefinite 
detention. Only the severely ill or injured are being taken to the United 
States. (Children born at the camps are considered Cuban nationals.) 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, officials are preparing to play host to the balseros for the long 
term. The military is recruiting doctors, teachers and other skilled personnel 
among the camp population to augment services. A Cuban American civilian 
administrator may soon be appointed to serve as liaison between migrants and 
their overseers, officials said. The government is flying in nonprofit lawyers 
to observe conditions and speak with the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, U.S. and Cuban negotiators are working to craft a formal mechanism 
that would allow the repatriation of those willing to go back to Cuba. There 
seems to be little doubt that U.S. policy-makers would prefer that most 
migrants exercise this option, however unpalatable. Compared to the grim 
barracks existence on Guantanamo, officials reason, life back in Cuba may 
eventually not seem that bad. But no one will be forced back, authorities 
vowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointedly, Cubans can only take advantage of the new immigration slots by 
applying at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Migrants at Guantanamo are 
only being warehoused, not processed. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing detainees to apply for visas, political asylum or other relief at 
Guantanamo, officials explained, might prompt others in Cuba to set out on 
rickety vessels or attempt to crash the base boundaries from Cuban territory 
bordering the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how many of those now held at Guantanamo could even qualify for 
U.S. entry once the new criteria are hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with close family in the United States and documented histories of 
political oppression are likely to receive preference in what is expected to be 
a fierce competition for the minimum of 20,000 Cuban entries guaranteed each 
year. But many rafters are young and have only distant U.S. kin and thus may 
not easily fit the profile. Guantanamo detainees are openly skeptical of ever 
receiving visas, many having been spurned before. 
</P>
<P>
 Denouncing the U.S.-Cuba accord, Cubans at Guantanamo who say they were sold 
out have staged large-scale protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, military officials expressed confidence that they can keep the 
camps operating on a long-term basis -- despite the threat of violence, the 
cost (now estimated at $20 million a month just for basics) and the disruption 
of a critical fleet training and logistics site.

 Thirty-seven Cuban refugees were released from a detention center Thursday 
under a new federal policy that benefits children, their parents and some 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The group released from the Krome detention center consisted of 19 children 
and 18 adults, said Lemar Wooley, a Miami spokesman for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service.Most of the adults were mothers of the children, Wooley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The order cracking down on Cubans arriving in this country by raft was 
loosened Wednesday, Wooley said, to allow the release of children and the 
adults responsible for them, as well as people who would qualify on 
humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had already released 19 Cubans from Krome in the last month, 
including four pregnant women, a paraplegic man and his wife, and a mother and 
her 2-month-old child.

MAN KILLS SELF ON LIVE TV AFTER KILLING WIFE

 A sheriff's deputy shot his wife to death outside the courthouse where she had 
gone to divorce him Thursday, then took his own life as a TV station broadcast 
efforts by a friend and priest to get him to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Broussard, 39, shot Andrea Baden Broussard, 26, at least five times 
inside a parking garage behind the Rapides Parish Courthouse, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two hours later, after a friend, a priest and a police chaplain 
failed to convince Broussard to surrender, he put a gun to his head and pulled 
the trigger. The act was broadcast live. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends in law enforcement rushed in as Broussard collapsed. A crowd of 
observers screamed and some cried. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been married for six years and had a 2-year-old daughter. He 
also had a 10-year-old child from a previous marriage.

 The space shuttle Discovery's astronauts sidled up to a satellite loaded with 
valuable data and plucked it from orbit, two days after it was set free to 
study the sun, NASA officials at Kennedy Space Center said. Commander Richard 
Richards steered Discovery to within 35 feet of the sun-gazing satellite, 
Spartan.Then astronaut Susan Helms snatched the gleaming, 2,800-pound 
spacecraft with the shuttle's mechanical arm. Helms tucked the boxy satellite 
into Discovery's cargo bay for the trip home, taking a little longer than 
expected to lock it in place. The shuttle's radar -- used to track the 
satellite -- had failed when Spartan was put into orbit on Tuesday and 
initially gave less-than-accurate measurements. But it ended up working 
"marvelously," Richards said.

JUSTICE DEPT. PULLS OUT OF RELIGION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton ordered the Justice Department to withdraw at the last 
minute from a case in which the government was to argue against a church's 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The department had filed legal papers in the bankruptcy case this spring, 
contending that financially troubled parishioners had no right to make 
donations to their church a year before filing for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House said Clinton told Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to pull out of the 
case. The department withdrew shortly before appellate arguments Thursday in 
St. Louis. "This is consistent with his personal interest and his record in 
support of religious freedom," said Phil Lader, Clinton's deputy chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is one of the first major tests of the Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act, passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is $13,500 that Bruce and Nancy Young gave to the Crystal Evangelical 
Free Church of New Hope, Minn.. A judge had ruled that because the Youngs got 
nothing of value for the donations, the offerings amounted to a fraudulent 
transfer of assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the church, however, say that contributing money to a church is an 
act of worship protected by the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department move left the bankruptcy trustee's attorney to argue 
the case alone.

SCIENTISTS UNLOCK 'FANTASTIC' GENE TO BOOST PLANT GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists have unlocked a gene that one day could bring bigger ears of corn, 
more roses on each bush and even faster-growing forests, all by controlling a 
hormone inside each plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of the uses -- it's fantastic," said Jedrzej Szerszen, a 
Michigan State University plant pathologist who helped discover how to 
genetically manipulate plants' natural growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study published today in the journal Science, Szerszen and colleagues 
Robert Bandurski and Krzystof Szczyglowski isolated and cloned a gene that 
controls the hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," said Dr. Jerry Cohen of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
who said genetic engineering might begin replacing growth chemicals in two to 
five years. "This is the first step." 
</P>
<P>
 Plant growth depends on a hormone called IAA. A gene called iaglu produces an 
enzyme that controls how much IAA is free within plants to boost growth and how 
much is inactive, explained Bandurski, who has researched IAA for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Michigan State scientists plucked the iaglu gene out of corn, cloned it 
and manipulated it to produce more of the vital enzyme. 
</P>
<P>
 They then injected tobacco, which grows quickly and accepts genetic 
engineering well, with the gene. Instead of the normally unwieldy plant, they 
grew bushier tobacco with more branches -- essentially getting the same amount 
in a smaller space.

PARENTS OF SLAIN JAPANESE YOUTH WIN DAMAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A home owner was ordered Thursday to pay $653,000 to the parents of a Japanese 
exchange student who was shot to death in 1992 when he went to the wrong door 
while looking for a Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
 State District Judge Bill Brown rejected Rodney Peairs' explanation that he 
thought 16-year-old Yoshihiro Hattori was a lunatic bent on hurting him and his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no justification that the killing was necessary to save himself or 
his family," Brown ruled in a lawsuit filed by the boy's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Peairs, 32, was acquitted last year of manslaughter in the slaying, which 
reinforced the United States' image in Japan as a land of gunslingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Masaichi and Mieko Hattori, who had asked for as much as $850,000, plan to 
give the money to a foundation they established in their son's name to foster 
understanding between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the verdict was in our favor, the hole in my heart will always be 
there forever," Mieko Hattori said. And in a plea to the American people, she 
said: "Please decrease the number of handguns as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Hattori was shot after he and the son of his host parents got lost while 
looking for a Halloween party. Hattori was dressed in a John Travolta-style 
disco costume -- a white tuxedo and an open-collar shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who spoke little English, didn't stop when Peairs shouted, 
"Freeze!" Peairs opened fire with a .44-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Peairs was ordered to pay $85,000 -- the maximum allowed under state law -- 
for the youth's pain and suffering; $275,000 each to his parents, for the 
wrongful death; and about $18,000 to cover funeral expenses.

 The breakup of a mob-run operation proved that the United States is more than 
a destination for cocaine and heroin.Authorities said the outfit sent huge 
quantities of drugs from a New York pizzeria to Italy. More than 100 people 
were named as participants in the scheme that allegedly brought cocaine and 
heroin from Colombia and other points to New York, where some was distributed 
locally and the rest sent to Italy. Authorities said the distribution 
headquarters for at least the last year was a single pizzeria, Famous Original 
Ray's at 43rd Street and Third Avenue in mid-Manhattan.

report to prove they were victims of rape or incest, a federal judge ruled in 
Philadelphia. In overturning part of the state's restrictive abortion law, the 
judge also said the state could not require that two doctors certify an 
abortion is necessary to save a woman's life before it can be paid for with 
federal funds.Those sections of the Pennsylvania law were improper because they 
are more restrictive than the federal Hyde Amendment, U.S. District Judge John 
P. Fullam said. The Hyde Amendment, which banned the use of federal money for 
abortions except to save a woman's life, was amended by Congress last October 
to include cases of rape and incest.

PANEL RECOMMENDS CREATION OF STATE POST TO OVERSEE TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A commission appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson after the collapse of a $50-million 
Department of Motor Vehicles computer project urged Thursday that a key state 
bureaucracy be junked and a powerful post of information technology czar be 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he will start implementing the recommendations of the task force 
of business executives and academics that he appointed in June to recommend 
improvements in the management of the state's high-tech information systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson created the panel after it was disclosed last spring that $50 million 
had been invested by the DMV during the past seven years in a computer project 
that will never work. Wilson officials killed the project in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member task force called for abolition of the state Office of 
Information Technology, an entity of the governor's Department of Finance that 
is charged with reviewing multimillion-dollar computer projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside investigators told Wilson that the information technology office 
is so focused on the intricate processes of bureaucracy that its objectives 
"conflict with (the) departmental and project objectives" it is charged with 
supervising. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Office of Information Technology does not add significant value in either 
information technology advocacy or oversight," the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also called for appointing a powerful "chief information 
officer" who would assume overall responsibility for development and 
administration of information technology and report directly to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) introduced legislation at the last session 
calling for an information technology czar who would report directly to the 
governor. The measure got sidetracked and is expected to be reintroduced in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill also has warned in a series of reports of 
other troubled computer projects throughout state government.

SACRAMENTO FILE: WILSON SIGNS BILL CLEARING TESTS OF FIREFIGHTING 'SCOOPER' 
AIRCRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a bill to allow the state to lease and 
test two so-called "super scooper" aircraft that can swoop low over lakes and 
rivers and pick up water to be used to fight fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation (AB 2802) authored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) passed the Assembly and Senate on 70-3 and 21-17 votes, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fires that raged through Malibu, Laguna Beach and other communities in 
1993 burned with incredible speed and intensity," Friedman said. "It was 
apparent to all who witnessed the devastation caused by the fires that we must 
develop new strategies for controlling them." 
</P>
<P>
 Each aircraft has the ability to pick up 1,600 gallons of water at a time to 
drop on wildfires.

WILSON TARGETS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson is airing a new 30-second television ad that says 
it is unfair for California taxpayers to have to pay for public schooling for 
illegal immigrant children. The commercial quotes his Democratic opponent, 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, out of context in attempting to portray Brown 
as believing that illegal immigration is not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: An announcer declares that there are 300,000 illegal immigrant 
children in public schools, costing the state $1.5 billion a year, "and they 
keep coming." Then Wilson says: "It's unfair to the people who are working 
hard, paying taxes, educating their children, and here we are rewarding people 
who enter the country illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad continues: "Wilson wants to use the money spent on illegals to take 
care of California's kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown thinks differently. In a major policy speech, Brown said, 
'Illegal immigration is wrongly seen as a cause of problems in California.' 
Where do you stand?" 
</P>
<P>
 * ANALYSIS: The Wilson reelection campaign attributes the 300,000 figure to 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates of the numbers of 
children who came into California illegally with their parents. The 
$1.5-billion estimate comes from the state Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson commercial takes Brown's comments out of context. Near the end of a 
lengthy speech at Los Angeles Town Hall last Sept. 29, after discussing the 
problem of illegal immigration in detail, Brown said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in times when many of our people are scared. They're scared of losing 
their jobs; they're scared of losing their health care; they're scared their 
children can't get a decent education, and they're scared about their personal 
safety. Illegal immigration is wrongly seen as a cause." Throughout the 
campaign, Brown has proposed ideas for reducing illegal immigration and, at the 
beginning of the speech, she said "illegal immigration is a problem and must be 
addressed in a responsible and thoughtful manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Brown have differed sharply on public education of illegal 
immigrants. Wilson has proposed that public schooling of illegal immigrants be 
phased out and generally supports Proposition 187, which would bar illegal 
immigrant children from schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown has said the federal government should reimburse California for the cost 
of services to illegal immigrants. Addressing Proposition 187 in a speech in 
San Francisco on Tuesday, Brown said that by denying education to the children 
"we will be throwing them out into the streets. What they don't learn in 
school, they'll learn in the streets. . . . And that will cost us a lot more in 
the end."

LOSS OF WETLANDS THREATENS STATE'S SHRIMP, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government declared four species of California shrimp threatened 
or endangered Thursday because of loss of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the threatened wetlands habitat is in the Central Valley, although the 
shrimp exist in at least 13 counties, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An exhaustive review of all the available data makes it clear that listing is 
warranted," Fish and Wildlife Service Director Mollie Beattie said in a news 
release. The agency will soon outline proposals to preserve wetlands, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The threatened or endangered shrimp are known to exist in Butte, Contra Costa, 
Glenn, Merced, Riverside, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Shasta, 
Solano, Tehama, Tulare and Ventura counties, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated as endangered were the conservancy fairy shrimp, the longhorn fairy 
shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Listed as threatened was the vernal 
pool fairy shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie said only a fraction of the proposed development projects in the 
region would be hurt by the listing.

WELCOME TO THE KINGDOM OF SPELLING'S PRETTY DOLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's been known as the wife of a mega-producer, the mother of a TV starlet 
and the woman who built that L.A. mansion. But now Candy Spelling is striking 
out on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 She will introduce her line of Candy Spelling Fantasy Dolls on the QVC 
shop-at-home channel Sunday morning at 11, selling limited-edition vinyl 
figures with such names as Pamela, Catherine and Little Bo Peep. Some will be 
dressed in glamorous gowns worthy of a woman like, well, Candy Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a passion," she says of her dolls. "They are special." 
</P>
<P>
 So special that she finds herself chatting with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible," she confesses, "but sometimes when I'm (with them) late at 
night, I'll talk to them. I mean, God forbid they would answer you." 
</P>
<P>
 Forgive Spelling her weakness for anthropomorphizing these sweet-faced 
creatures. It's just that she knows them inside and out, from their little 
blue-irised eyes and golden manes to the lace-trimmed bloomers tucked under 
their dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is Spelling's true calling, it has taken her decades to find it. The 
late-40ish wife of producer Aaron Spelling ("Beverly Hills, 90210," "Melrose 
Place") and mother of actress Tori Spelling (Donna on "90210"), has been an 
interior decorator, a shop owner and a socialite with a penchant for big jewels 
and drop-dead designer clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also the mastermind behind the masterhouse, the family's 
56,000-square-foot mansion near Beverly Hills that became, during its 
years-long construction, the butt of countless jokes about decadence and 
overindulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Spelling glides through the house's enormity confidently, 
arriving half an hour late to an office shared by two secretaries. Her 
shoulder-length blond hair complements a taupe silk charmeuse blouse and taupe 
pants accented with a gold chain belt dripping little charms -- an ensemble 
that blends with the muted peach and beige decor. 
</P>
<P>
 She apologizes profusely, then leads the way through a hallway and into an 
elevator, down one floor, past a huge conference room and a game room with a 
pool table to the doll museum. If not for the occasional family photograph, the 
house, which also features a gift-wrapping room, might be mistaken for a plush 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum houses Spelling's collection of hundreds of vinyl Madame Alexander 
dolls, the darlings of a New York manufacturer in business since 1923. The 
pristine Alexanders line custom-designed glass-front cabinets. Each is tagged 
with a name, number and year of issue. The temperature is kept a little 
chillier here -- it's better for the dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolls Spelling designed for her Fantasy collection stand at attention, 
mouths frozen in Mona Lisa smiles, on a small stage rimmed with a fringed 
burgundy velvet curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Each was born in an attic workroom complete with exposed pipes. In the middle 
of the night, when inspiration hits, Spelling sneaks up the stairs, past the 
dust mops and vacuum cleaners, to her neat aerie. Fabric swatches are tacked up 
on boards and sketches line a wall. Drawing tables are outfitted with markers 
and pads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The QVC connection, Spelling explains, came about with the help of a longtime 
friend, fashion designer Nolan Miller. "(He) was there selling his jewelry and 
he saw some dolls on a table. He's very outspoken and he said to the president 
of QVC, 'These are ugly dolls. You should see Candy Spelling's dolls' -- he 
meant my collection." 
</P>
<P>
 QVC made her an offer to do her own line. It took her a week to say yes. 
</P>
<P>
 An admitted perfectionist, Spelling went detail crazy in creating the 
prototypes. Eyes were changed, protruding ears pinned back, and legs 
re-sculpted before the Alexander Doll Co. could begin production. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a picture of Betty Grable," she recalls, "the old pinup picture, a 
front and back view, and I sent it to them and said I wanted the legs to look 
just like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The cherubic face of the smaller 12-inch dolls is based on a childhood 
photograph of Candy; the bigger 17-inch dolls look a little like Tori. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I did this was not a narcissistic thing," she explains, but rather 
an attempt to have her dolls look different from the other Alexanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspirations for the dolls' clothing came from Spelling's prom dress, a 
favorite blue cocktail dress, a Grace Kelly costume and a friend's riding 
habit, among many others. Each has a delicate undergarment, from teddies to 
bloomers. With so much detail, prices are dear -- from about $150 to $350. 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling says she has always loved dolls and kept 30 stuffed animals on her 
bed when she was a little girl. "And I couldn't go to sleep until each one was 
in its place." 
</P>
<P>
 But she didn't become a serious collector of Alexander dolls until 15 years 
ago when a friend gave her old dolls to Tori. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, all right, let's start doing this together. . . . I had doll 
shelves in her room and she had them all across the wall. Finally when she got 
older she said, 'Mom, this is not my collection, it's your collection. Please 
stop calling it my collection.' So, it was like, OK, I'll admit it, I'm a 
grown-up and I'm collecting dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling's cut of the QVC proceeds will go to Centro de Ninos, child-care 
centers Downtown and in East Los Angeles that service poor working families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went there about six months ago, and I had never seen anything like it. It 
was just amazing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And since we've lived here," she adds, "I've let children from different 
children's charities come through in small groups and see just the doll museum. 
To see their faces looking at my dolls that I've collected, it's just kind of . 
. . you know. It's really special. Some of them just break my heart because you 
see these faces and think, oh my God, do they even own a doll?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion designer Miller, who has seen his friend through every phase of the 
doll production, believes she has truly found her niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lives in a house where everyone is famous," he says. "But this is her 
project. Last night I was helping her pack up some of the dolls and she knows 
their names, they're like her babies, she knows everything about them. It's not 
just something Candy's putting her name on." 
</P>
<P>
 With the QVC debut just days away, is Spelling nervous? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'm nervous!" she says. "I'm not even used to doing interviews. . . 
. I've always been behind the scenes and been very happy doing that. It's not a 
problem. (So I'm doing this) just because I really, really love it and I want 
everyone else to feel the same. Once a decorator, once a proprietor, but this 
is the best."

A LESSON IN LOVE?; THE LATEST CAMPUS DEBATE IS WHETHER STUDENT-PROFESSOR 
ROMANCES ARE ABOUT POWER OR PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may start with a bawdy passage from Chaucer or a heated explication of cell 
mitosis. A student's eyes meet a professor's. Hearts pitter-pat. 
</P>
<P>
 And before you can say "Educating Rita," homework has a whole new connotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Students returning to campus this fall will likely find the debate about 
"consensual relations" one of the hottest fronts in the ongoing gender wars. 
</P>
<P>
 From guidelines discouraging professors from dating people currently enrolled 
in their classes to blanket bans on fraternization between faculty and 
students, college administrators from Cal State Fullerton to Harvard have 
proposed or passed edicts on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaction to what some see as the authoritarian underpinnings of the 
"banning movement," a loosely knit group called CASE -- Consenting Academics 
For Sexual Equity -- has taken the matter onto the Internet, where opponents 
are gathering via E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone who has jumped into the debate will concede that some 
student-professor flings can blossom into loving relationships -- even 
marriage. Virtually everyone deplores harassment by professors or any exchange 
of sex for grades. 
</P>
<P>
 If the various sides agree on anything else, it is that this issue, like many 
other societal concerns these days, pivots on a handful of fundamental terms: 
power . . . consent . . . responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the argument moves quickly into the subtle semantics of gender 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Well before CASE sent the discussion sizzling through cyberspace, hanky-panky 
had been translated into the abstruse murk of academese. Student-professor 
shenanigans became "intimate asymmetrical relationships," deriving from "power 
differentiated positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Professors, in other words, have more clout than students. Therefore 
interactions between students and instructors are unequal. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what?" smirk opponents of restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "So stop it!" huff those who see themselves as supporters of students' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Dank, a professor of sociology at Cal State Long Beach who organized 
CASE last spring, says he has as strong a record as anyone of encouraging 
students to file complaints against harassers. But such cases, he adds, have 
nothing to do with students who enter freely into a relationship with a 
professor -- or with anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 He blames much of the anti-fraternization activity on "authoritarian 
feminists. . . . They take this motherly image -- 'We'll protect you whether 
you want our help or not.' How hypocritical! How offensive!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Dank locked horns with Anita Bryant, whose "Save Our 
Children" campaign attempted to ban homosexual teachers from public schools. He 
sees similarities between that "crusade" and this one, which also presumes to 
protect innocent students, and paints men as sexual predators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm alienated from the idea of putting women back into the category of 'women 
and children,' " he says, "from the whole victimization cult. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Chinchilla, a sociology professor and director of the women's studies 
program at Long Beach, doesn't think much of the case made by CASE. Concern 
about relations between instructors and students who date is fueled by 
compassion, not ideology, she says. "So many women faculty members end up 
having to put the pieces together after these things go awry, after these 
students have major trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernice Sandler, a scholar with the National Assn. for Women in Education, a 
3000-member professional support and development group, has studied numerous 
surveys of harassment on college campuses. She says that 20% to 30% of 
undergraduate women and 30% to 40% of women in graduate programs report that 
professors have subjected them to behavior that is defined as sexual harassment 
by those conducting the surveys -- although the students did not initially 
consider it such. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, she says, women who have had relations with professors 
often believe that the affair is consensual as it occurs but later become 
convinced that they were exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 Some feminist scholars even contend that consent is a meaningless term in 
relations of this sort. 
</P>

 "The Lecherous Professor" (University of Illinois, 1984), an influential book 
on harassment, states that view emphatically. In a note added to the 1990 
edition, co-author Billie Wright Dziech argues: "Where power differentials 
exist, there can be no 'mutual consent.' The infinitesimal number of cases in 
which professors/teaching assistants and students do develop genuine and 
seemingly abiding attractions can, as the book suggests, be treated on an 
individual basis without denying students protection from the campus Lotharios 
who claim 'consent' every time they seek to bed a confused or intimidated 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinchilla recalls a student who came sobbing into her office after a male 
faculty member had dumped her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'I was so flattered. He was the first man I had ever met who wasn't 
interested in my body, but was interested in my mind.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She found that incredibly wonderful. But then she found out it wasn't her 
mind that he was interested in. When I suggested that maybe she wanted to make 
a complaint, because after she had backed off she felt really pressured in her 
act, she said, 'No, it was my fault for not realizing what was happening in the 
first place.' 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of students never complain. They feel it's their fault." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Ann J. Lane, a history professor and chair of the women's 
studies program at the University of Virginia, most of the students alleging 
sexual harassment against professors on her campus say the relationships began 
as consensual ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Lane spearheaded an effort at Virginia to enact guidelines that 
included a ban of all relations between undergraduate students and their 
professors. Lane says she was astonished at the intensity of the national 
debate on the guidelines -- which the administration ultimately refused to 
enact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the regulation was to empower students. . . . Many students 
said, 'I didn't know how to say no.' 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you say no," asks Lane, "to someone who's your father's age and on 
your dissertation committee? . . . I have students who drop out of school, who 
say 'I can't go back into the chemistry building.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To those who say students are adults and don't need to be told how to behave, 
Lane replies: "We do that all the time. We tell these adults what courses they 
can take, what alcohol they can drink." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say, Lane contends, that she and those who support her views 
are interested in regulating the sexual lives of students. "It would be 
impossible. It's the professors we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students who say they are involved in good relationships with professors are 
as reluctant to speak on the record as those who say they have been devastated. 
Both fear repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who asked to be identified only as a graduate student at a Midwest 
college, for instance, tells of falling in love with a professor while she 
served as his graduate research assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple waited until the student was no longer the professor's charge 
before consummating their attraction. But then one of the young woman's 
classmates spotted the couple at an off-campus cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called a meeting of my other classmates (in the department). . . . The 
department chair called us in and said, 'This will stop.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The couple refused to break up. So the chair refused to issue a letter 
critiquing the student's progress. Meanwhile, word of the relationship spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had the scarlet letter on my head," the woman says. "I consider 
myself fairly liberal, but I am very offended by the feminist insinuation that 
as a woman I am incapable of making my own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all make mistakes," she continues. "If dating a professor is a mistake, we 
learn from it. But we could make that same mistake with a businessman or 
banker. . . . If you are a male in this society, you always have more power 
than a woman, so any relationship could be considered asymmetrical." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like that student, Daphne Patai, a professor of Spanish and Women's Studies at 
the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has tapped into CASE's nascent 
electronic debate on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't formally affiliated herself with the group. But Patai, who 
co-authored an upcoming book -- "Professing Feminism: Cautionary Tales From the 
Strange World of Women's Studies" (Basic Books, 1994) -- does worry about the 
"crusade mentality," on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professors," she says, "are not ogres, and students are not children. . . . 
When I was a grad student, women had to be in the dorms at 10:30 or 11:00. . . 
. In the bad old days, people lost jobs because they had relations with 
students. Do we want to do that all over again?" 
</P>
<P>
 At least some critics of student-faculty relations scoff at the notion that it 
must come to that. Judith Sheine, an assistant professor of architecture at 
UCLA and Cal Poly Pomona, notes that she and many of her female colleagues 
have, on occasion, been hit upon by young men in their classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proper response, she says, is simply to "act professorial." One way or 
another, she says, she and the professors she knows get the student's focus 
back on the class. "As a faculty member, it seems to me, you should have some 
self-control." 
</P>
<P>
 Dank, of Long Beach, is rankled that the argument so often is cast in such 
highbrow tones -- as if professors were all-powerful gods and students mere 
mortals. The issue for him hinges on logic, not sex -- although the sex aspect 
is what keeps the thinking skewed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: If conflict of interest is such a concern, why do ban supporters 
tend to ignore other obvious breeches, such as professors who have colleagues' 
children or spouses in their classes? 
</P>
<P>
 "And what about friendships? Think about the components of friendship: Caring, 
loyalty. . . . Why select out the sexual component for special attention?" 
</P>
<P>
 By Dank's analysis, the challenge to "asymmetry" stems not from true concern 
about conflict of interest or compassion for fragile young souls, but from 
"older females attempts to control younger females." 
</P>
<P>
 Dank shifts into very professorial, one-man Socratic dialogue: 
</P>
<P>
 "One would say, 'Well Dank, I don't quite get it. Why would middle-aged 
females' -- which is basically what we're talking about -- 'why would they want 
to control younger students?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is, Dank answers, a historic tension between the generations. He sees it 
like this: Older men have never been averse to younger women's charms. Younger 
women are naturally -- perhaps biologically -- attracted to men of power and 
wisdom, who happen to be older as a rule. So young women are always draining 
the pool of mature, intelligent men from which middle-aged women hope to find 
mates. This is especially true at the university, where older men and younger 
women continuously rub together, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Academic feminists, naturally, resent that, he says. And they're willing to 
force bureaucratic controls on younger women to keep them in line, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chinchilla, increasingly cast as Dank's nemesis at Long Beach, doesn't buy his 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's an incredible fantasy on his part," she says. "It makes these 
middle-aged men seem so incredibly attractive. The reason they're dating their 
18- and 19-year-old students is because women their own age are on to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not really the issue, Chinchilla says: "If the classroom becomes 
sexualized, if the boundaries become blurred in ways that hint at intimacy, I 
think the learning environment becomes contaminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Blythe, an associate professor of English at the University of Kentucky, 
took a different tack during an exchange on the subject in Harper's Magazine 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those pushing for a ban," she said, "are people who fear real life, 
especially the protean power of lust. College for them is about isolation from 
the real world, not introduction to it."  
</P>
<P>
 The Harper's exchange drew a blistering response from readers, including many 
academics. Blythe ("I'm the most retiring person around") was stunned and 
offended.  
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, she is more circumspect. Sex is complicated, she says. Cruelty 
of any sort, on the other hand, is rather simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "People must learn to be personally responsible," she says. "That's the 
problem with our young people -- they need to learn to be more responsible for 
their lives and for their bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only part of the problem: "I'm very sympathetic with women who are 
beset by arrogant, mean, self-serving professors. Apparently there are a lot of 
them out there. I'm glad I don't know them. It's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The antidote to naive irresponsibility and cunning selfishness may be 
conveniently close at hand, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than having a ban on faculty-student sex, we should have a requirement 
that everyone read Milton and Shakespeare. I think when we neglect the older 
authors we lose the great lessons about being loving and responsible. We forget 
the values of strong community. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "In the classics, there's a great celebration of the joy of being alive, of 
the amazing gift of life and the world and the responsibility you have toward 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 If professors and students were better grounded in those values, she says, 
their passion for each other might, at least occasionally, give way to a 
passion for knowledge.

AROUND TOWN: A VOICE THAT CANNOT BE SILENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came together in a storefront meetinghouse near Melrose and Vermont -- 
Anglos and Latinos, new immigrants and old-time activists -- to remember those 
slain in the Chilean coup of September, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Most especially, they came to honor Victor Jara, whose songs were the anthems 
of Chile's poor and oppressed. Jara was only 39 when silenced by Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet's troops, but his music lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very emotional night," organizer Paul Baker says. Jara is one of 
his heroes, a man who understood injustice and had a gift for making "very 
beautiful, lasting songs" to express a people's anger and outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Baker has brought his guitar -- the guitar he fashioned from a chair 
leg, a floor plank and other castoffs while a hermit monk in Scotland in the 
'60s. He is about to sing, in English and in Spanish, "Manifiesto," which Jara 
wrote shortly before he was killed. It goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 This guitar has no song for the rich. . . . It sings of the ladder we're 
building so that one day we will all reach the stars. . . .  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 The narrow, high-ceilinged room with its wall of cardboard murals depicting 
the lives of Mexicans is packed. There is the clattering of folding chairs, the 
occasional wail of a siren drifting through the door left open to let in the 
night air. 
</P>
<P>
 This space, home of the Colectivo Macondo, is a Latin American cultural 
center, not a concert hall. And this event is less a concert than a pena or 
cultural cafe or, as Baker calls it, "a Latin hootenanny." It's about emotion, 
not perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, Ross Altman is singing a song of tribute to Jara, with music by Arlo 
Guthrie. The lyrics, by an English poet, describe Jara's death: 
</P>
<P>
 They tortured him for two long days, they beat his lovely head. They broke the 
bones in both his hands, then they shot him dead . 
</P>
<P>
 Fragrant empanadas are being dished up at the Colectivo's snack bar. Up front, 
Bolivian musician Fernando Yugar is introduced. Hold everything! He's lost his 
zampona , a bamboo panpipe. Lights on! The lost is found. Yugar plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor David Clennon, who was in the 1982 film "Missing," the story of a young 
American who disappeared in Chile, reads Jara's last, unfinished poem, scrawled 
in prison: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . What I have felt  
</P>
<P>
 And what I feel  
</P>
<P>
 Will give birth  
</P>
<P>
 to the moment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I had tears in my eyes when he read," says Juani Funes, a Chilean who left 
the country in 1976 and now lives in Mission Viejo and teaches at Orange Coast 
College and UC Irvine. "Between 1968 and 1971, when I was at the university (in 
Chile), Victor Jara was very, very popular. I saw him once. I was interested in 
what was going on, politically speaking." 
</P>
<P>
 This is an evening with a cause, not just a celebration of a life snuffed out 
two decades ago. It's a fund-raiser for the Victor Jara Foundation, recently 
established to keep his legacy alive and to further international cultural 
solidarity among the have-nots through music, art and written word. 
</P>
<P>
 Don White, a high school teacher and longtime companero (friend of the 
movement), passes a basket "to keep Victor singing." Tonight, about $600 will 
be raised. (A big boost is expected from November's New York premiere of the 
film of Isabel Allende's "Of Love and Shadows," a benefit for the foundation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Joan Baez's name is invoked here. Protesting the Vietnam 
war, she'd sung of the "weary mothers of the world." Her song is sung this 
night by Leslie Baer-Brown, a Whittier College staffer who founded Xela Aid to 
help the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman speaks of the "disappeared," but also of the homeless living in our 
parks. He then sings an original song, a tribute to Salvador Allende, the 
Marxist president deposed by Pinochet. It takes a poke at Henry Kissinger, then 
secretary of state. It also provides inadvertent comic relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaura Rivera, translating in Spanish, mishears and interprets Dr. Kissinger 
as Dr. King. No, no, Altman corrected: "This has nothing to do with Martin 
Luther King." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Altman protest song -- written for Cesar Chavez -- evokes memories: "I 
was standing outside a Safeway in 1968 . . . " Ned Moore, a family therapist 
from Sherman Oaks, leans over and whispers, "That's what I was doing, 
boycotting grapes." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not what Baker, now 55, was doing. In 1968, he was preparing to check 
out of a Scottish monastery, to make his way as a writer and musician. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he'd never heard of Victor Jara. Several years later, Chilean 
refugees in Scotland introduced him to Jara's songs. Baker became a devotee, 
even though they never met. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that many people know of him," he says. "He deliberately refused 
stardom." Jara poked fun at the Establishment, at what he saw as the hypocrisy 
of the Catholic Church, at the fence-sitting middle classes. His songs had 
roots deep in Chilean tradition, which was key to what Baker calls Jara's 
"challenge to the U.S.-ification of international culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is a slight, bearded man, a lapsed Catholic who wryly defines himself as 
somewhat inclined to extremes -- "In the whole of the British Isles, there were 
just 60 hermit monks. . . . It was kind of a weird thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 He was just passing through the United States, having taken part in a 
political demonstration in Washington in 1987, when he was sidetracked. Moving 
in with a Salvadoran family in L.A., he began working within the "safe house" 
movement for Salvadoran refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has made 10 trips to Chile and supports himself by touring England and 
Scotland each year, singing Jara's songs. And he's writing a novel about 
government corruption, the U.S. role in Nicaragua and "Colonel South," a 
controversial candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 From his office in the L.A.-area home he shares, Baker is the U.S. link to the 
foundation and Jara's widow, Joan, in Chile. A Briton who thinks of himself as 
a Scot, he is also the foundation's tie to Great Britain, Joan Jara's native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-taught in Spanish (he claims to have been working his way through his 
"Spanish in Three Months" text for 10 years), he has compiled a book of 
singable translations of Jara songs to raise money for the foundation. Under 
his umbrella network, "Echoes of Silence," Baker carries on the fight for 
Jara's people -- the peasants, field workers, miners of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Jara's songs he sings is the "Song of the Miner":  
</P>
<P>
 . . . I am a miner  
</P>
<P>
 I go to the mine  
</P>
<P>
 I go to death  
</P>
<P>
 I am a miner

BEHIND THE WHEEL: AURORA OUTSHINES OLDSMOBILE'S IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When consumer groups focused on the clean steel statuary of Oldsmobile's 
proposed Aurora, the feedback was like a head-on collision: damaging yet 
educational. 
</P>
<P>
 Led to believe that the car was built by Lexus, most critics for a day said 
they would consider buying the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Told it was an Oldsmobile, they changed their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Company conclusions were inescapable: Oldsmobile had become a name synonymous 
with cars that didn't work, usually limped home, looked frumpy and, frankly, 
weren't as desirable as your father's Oldsmobile 442. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the rocket ship logo -- a symbol of Oldsmobile power and celestial sales 
ambitions since the space-traveling '60s -- was considered a leper. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 1995 Aurora luxury sedan comes to us naked of past symbology and 
stripped of familiar nomenclature in deep denial of being joined at the 
bloodline to General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
 The hood emblem is now an oval dissected by a chromium noodle that's maybe an 
A but is definitely a squiggle and vaguely Toyotan. "Aurora" is the solitary 
name on the trunk lid. "Oldsmobile" appears only in pygmy letters on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may consider this a sleight of Detroit packaging, fresh wrapping around 
old weaknesses and the hollow distancing of new products from past shame. After 
all, Oldsmobile is the feeblest of GM's seven car and truck divisions, sales 
have skidded 60% since 1986, fratricide has long been a whispered option, and 
that's quite enough negative baggage for any company outside the savings and 
loan business. 
</P>
<P>
 Or one could view Aurora as an honest renaissance, a comeback car conceived 
and crafted to be a triumph with a new image critical to its promise of 
substance. In that case, turning to a new identity and understated origins to 
attract buyers is no worse than leaning on pen names: If the book is good 
enough, you really don't need to know who wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 And Aurora is good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 It could even be a bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a front-drive luxury car that replaces the aircraft carrier Toronado 
and is squarely aimed at splitting the mid-levels of Lexus and Infiniti. Yet 
with its V-8 pulling power, endless equipment, quiet comfort and satin-slick 
transmission, plus advanced and handsome styling, Aurora would be better 
matched against heavyweights Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45 -- and for about 
$20,000 less. 
</P>
<P>
 As Cadillac blew up the notion that two-ton American cars, particularly 
Oldsmobiles, should maneuver like backhoes, so Aurora with its brick-stiff 
chassis, self-leveling suspension, and superior combination of ride and 
handling makes an even better case for four-door ballerinas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora shares this fine platform with the new Buick Riviera coupe, but goes 
its own way with a V-8 engine that is a downsized, 250-horsepower variant of 
GM's lusty 32-valve Northstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Externally, front and back, the Riviera is the better pinup with a rear deck 
that flatters by impersonating Jaguar. Aurora's squared-off, almost 
aristocratic rear is marred by huge backup lights bigger than warehouse floods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riviera presents a nose and chin with delicate chrome accents. Aurora is 
almost artless with a deep crease above a bottom-breathing grille and fog 
lights framed by a long figure eight of black rubber. Like two flashlights in a 
Thighmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside . . . ah, as Aurora is probably the best car in the 98-year history 
of Oldsmobile -- and at $32,000 the most expensive -- so is its interior the 
finest in carpeting and traveling comfort since Cesar Ritz furnished his first 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been made of modern car interiors that are cockpits. An Aurora pilot 
commands a flight deck that sweeps around the human form and encapsules without 
cramping, brings every control within instant reach of fingers and eyes without 
confusing either sense. 
</P>
<P>
 All window and mirror buttons are on the upslope of the door rest, just below 
a pictograph power-seat switch purloined from Mercedes-Benz. Instruments are 
large and speak to you. There's no squinting and reaching for trunk and gas 
flap remotes because they're conveniently set in the dashboard, just above the 
knee bolster. 
</P>
<P>
 From leather armchairs to computerized trip monitoring, through mine 'n' yours 
air bags and an overhead cubbyhole for the garage door remote, the Aurora glows 
with little luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Front seating is spacious, rear seat room not so airy. If Oldsmobile has to 
use a foot pedal for a parking brake, we wish it would disengage when the 
transmission is shifted to drive. And unless someone out there is converting 
Dodge Rams and Lincoln Town Cars into low riders, heating wires in the back 
window are distorting the rear view of following vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their refinements and growing excellence, there remain subtleties -- 
apparently unattainable, for they surely have been recognized -- that continue 
to separate imported from domestic luxury. A Mercedes rides like it was carved 
from a solid billet. In a Lexus, touch the ashtray and it opens with a hiss. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aurora, the ashtray clatters about its business. Close the center armrest 
too smartly and a collection of crab claws posing as cup holders start groping 
for something to do. Sadly, these items retain the feel and sound of low 
bidders in GM's component programs. 
</P>
<P>
 No complaints, however, about the mood of Aurora on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northstar engine -- although diluted by some 20 horsepower to prevent 
Oldsmobile stomping on Cadillac's turf -- is a throaty, muscular thing built to 
humiliate all lane laggards and on-ramp turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-lock brakes easily slow the car from the supersonic; the speed-sensitive 
power steering is a smidge on the heavy side, which is the way it should be, 
and the automatic transmission, except when kicking down and playing to the 
grandstand, never breaks its smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an effortless car, one of high performance and matching grandeur shod 
with premium wheels and tires that willingly remove the noise and vibrations of 
freeway hammering from the concern of its owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in the land of pseudonyms, the Aurora certainly intrigued 
those who thought they knew 'em all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatissit? Whomakesit?" begged one spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an Aurora, we told him, made by a company in Alaska. They plan to market 
a compact car, the Borealis. And maybe a convertible named Northern Exposure.

THE GOODS; THE ABCS OF FINDING A SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN / LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a tip for high school students seeking college scholarships for the 
1995-'96 school year or beyond: 
</P>
<P>
 Start now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wait until May of your senior year. By then the process is over," says 
Jack Wright, a counselor at Santa Monica Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors can use the fall to collect materials for scholarship applications due 
this winter, says Laurice Sommers, a college counselor at the Hamilton High 
Schools Complex. Juniors and sophomores can learn what scholarships they'll be 
eligible for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put lists together of where you might qualify. Notice what scholarships are 
going to students in your school and think about whether you'd be eligible," 
says Gloria Kapp, director of admissions and financial aid at Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be a detective," Sommers adds. "One of my students did research the spring of 
his junior year. He found a scholarship for students who played golf and had a 
strong grade point average. The only qualification he lacked was that he hadn't 
caddied at a golf course. The summer after his junior year, he got a job as a 
caddy. He went to the University of Colorado on scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 Searches are often rewarding because there are many scholarships, usually 
given for academic excellence, and grants, awarded on the basis of need. 
Neither has to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on assistance is available from high school counselors, college 
financial aid administrators, the U.S. Department of Education and the 
California Student Aid Commission in Sacramento. Students may also consult data 
bases and reference books. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students pay businesses as much as $200 to search for sources of aid they 
could find themselves, Kapp says. More than 80% of aid comes from federal and 
state programs, and another 19% from colleges and sources including businesses, 
foundations, and religious and community groups, a federal publication says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a scholarship search organization guarantees its services, find out what 
you have to do to get a refund if the guarantee isn't met," the publication 
warns. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who search for aid eventually must fill out applications. The Free 
Application for Federal Student Aid is necessary for scholarships, grants and 
financial aid from the federal and state governments and almost all colleges, 
Sommers says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who read carefully and get all their tax information and records 
together can complete the form in 60 to 90 minutes, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But others may make damaging mistakes. "A question asks whether you'll have 
your bachelor's degree by a certain date. Without thinking, they check yes. 
It's really their high school diploma they'll complete by that date," Sommers 
says. "Students also sometimes get mixed up and put parents' income under 
student's income, and that can hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most high schools offer a financial aid workshop that helps parents and 
students complete the form. That would be very helpful. The form is actually 
(only) four pages. But it can be intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
 After completing the form, students should mail it by January, Sommers says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students can apply for federal grants all the way through May. "But if they 
wait that long, they won't get financial aid from the state or from their 
college because those moneys will have been given out." 
</P>
<P>
 The major federal award is the Pell Grant, worth a maximum of $2,340 for the 
1994-'95 school year and based on need and the costs at a student's school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students applying for the major state of California grant, called a Cal Grant, 
must file a grade-point average verification form by March 2. College 
counselors at high schools mail the form to the California Student Aid 
Commission in Sacramento, Sommers says. 
</P>
<P>
 The need-based grant comes in three varieties. Cal Grant A is based on 
grade-point average while Cal Grant B is targeted at the economically 
disadvantaged. The grants pay up to $5,250 per year for private colleges, 
$3,799 for University of California schools or $1,584 for California State 
University campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Grant C is aimed at vocational programs at private schools or community 
colleges. It pays up to $2,360 for tuition and fees and $530 for 
training-related costs such as tools, special clothing and local 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to attend a private school also may need to submit a financial 
aid form to the College Scholarship Service of the College Board in Princeton, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants without green cards may apply to the state college system, where 
they're eligible for in-state tuition and aid from the extended opportunities 
program, Wright says. A court decision has denied the students those 
opportunities in the state university and community college systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It requires an effort to apply," says Kapp, the director of financial aid at 
Cal State Long Beach. "You have to keep track of varied dates that applications 
are due, and information the donor wants may differ from one scholarship to 
another. Some will want recommendations from teachers, for example, and some 
will want a personal statement from the student." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many students don't understand the process and eliminate themselves by not 
applying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many do not even attempt to find financial aid because they consider 
themselves middle income," says Wright, the counselor from Santa Monica 
Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk to 10 people with incomes that range from $28,000 to $85,000 annually 
and they all claim to be middle income. They all ace themselves out of the 
opportunity by their lack of knowledge of how the financial process works. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal methodology of the need analysis takes into account 35 to 40 
factors that determine the expected family contribution. A protection allowance 
is given for parents, depending on their age. The older you are when your 
children go to college, the larger your protection allowance will be, and the 
more eligible your child will be to receive financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families should also realize that the family that could not qualify for 
financial aid for one child may get aid if two children attend college. That's 
because the family's income remains steady, but its expenses are greater." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that families lose out on aid through lack of information is a shame, 
Wright says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs only 29 cents, the price of a stamp, to learn the facts." 
Scholarships and Grants 
</P>
<P>
 Many books provide information about scholarships and grants. Here are some 
recommended by college advisers: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Scholarship Book: The Complete Guide to Private Sector Scholarships, 
Grants and Loans for Undergraduates," fourth edition (Prentice Hall, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Directory of Financial Aids for Minorities" and the "Directory of Financial 
Aids for Women" (Reference Service Press, 1993-'95). 
</P>
<P>
 Also recommended is the College Cost Explorer FUND FINDER data base available 
at libraries and colleges. The data base was created by the College Board, 
sponsor of the Scholastic Assessment Test.

THE GOODS; ECONOTES; NEW GAME IS TREE-FRIENDLY IN A COUPLE OF WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Toby Zellers is a newcomer to the multibillion-dollar family-game industry, 
but he's trying to make an environmental ripple and sell some games at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 His Seven Wonders Game Co. Inc., based in Englewood, Colo., has introduced the 
first game in what he envisions as a "Better Products for a Better World" 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the gimmick? Not only are the games produced from 100% environmentally 
sound material, such as recycled paper and soy ink, he says, each game will 
benefit an environmental cause. 
</P>
<P>
 His first game, just released, is Prism Quest, a fantasy game employing dice, 
code books, code pads and more than 150 playing cards. For every game sold 
($24.95, plus $4 shipping and handling, if ordered from the company), Seven 
Wonders will donate $1 to the National Arbor Day Foundation, to plant a tree in 
Yellowstone National Forest, Zellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even recycled paper takes trees," he said. "We can't just keep chopping down 
these trees. This way, we are putting something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellers, 30, has been in the printing business all his life and the new game 
company is a division of his AccuGraphics Inc. He wants to encourage game 
manufacturers to follow his example. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some manufacturers do use recycled paper," he said, "but most people still 
don't realize it can be colorful and beautiful. Our game is printed on mostly 
glossy and coated stocks. We want people to know the techniques have improved." 
</P>
<P>
 His next game, Sphinx & Pharos, will be based on ancient Egyptian culture. Who 
will be the beneficiary? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're torn between an organization like Greenpeace or a project to save the 
pyramids," Zellers said. "They're falling apart right now." Information: (800) 
783-9631. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Readin', Writin' and Recyclin': That's the curriculum trend in the nation's 
schools, a new survey says. Virtually every school in the country now has some 
kind of environmental education program, according to Environmental Research 
Associates (ERA), which studies environmental attitudes and their effect on 
consumer behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 ERA staffers interviewed a nationwide sampling of 279 teachers, principals and 
school administrators. Compared to the same study in 1992, they found that 
student participation in school-based activities has shot up in many 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we found environmental classes at all levels, they are particularly 
increasing in elementary schools -- up to 61% in 1994 from 43% in 1992," said 
Anthony M. Casale, president of ERA, based in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are also taking more field trips to recycling facilities, nature 
centers and marine conservatories. Although books and magazines are the leading 
sources of environmental education, computer programs and games are closing the 
gap. 
</P>

 With more than 5 million public school students in California, waste from 
school lunches alone could total more than 15 million throwaways daily, says 
the California Integrated Waste Management Board.

INK: COMEDIAN SHOWS HIS SERIOUS SIDE

 With a wildly popular TV show ("Home Improvement") and nothing to gain from 
awkward revelations, you've got to admire Tim Allen for dishing out some frank, 
often sobering tales of prison life in his new book of otherwise comic 
observations, "Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man" (Hyperion). 
</P>
<P>
 As many already know, Allen did time for selling drugs. "Prison was the worst 
and the best thing that ever happened to me," he writes. "It taught me in no 
uncertain terms to be responsible for my own actions." It's also "a place where 
lunacy works. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy I met actually denied that he'd robbed the bank even though he was 
caught at the teller's window with a ski mask on and a shotgun in his hand. . . 
. As for me, let's be honest. I didn't do anything. I wasn't even there when 
the cops busted me. I was at my house, watching 'Home Improvement.' I was 
framed! I didn't do it!" 
</P>

 First printing? Try 600,000 copies.

 Author Strikes Gold: Clive Cussler, the best-selling author of "Raise the 
Titanic" and the more recent "Inca Gold," has concluded one of the richest 
publishing deals in recent years -- $14 million for his next two books. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lampack, his New York literary agent, announced Tuesday that Simon & 
Schuster will pay the sum for U.S. and Canadian rights to the books. 
</P>
<P>
 HarperCollins offered $17.5 million for worldwide English-language rights, 
Lampack added. But the author preferred to continue his relationship with Simon 
& Schuster and expects to make up much of the difference through a separate 
contract with HarperCollins for English-language rights abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Although book deals vary because they generally cover different territories 
and ancillary elements such as audio rights, in raw numbers the Cussler 
agreement resembles the three-book, $21-million contract that British novelist 
Jeffrey Archer reportedly cut with HarperCollins in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cussler contract appears to pay him more than the advances won by Mary 
Higgins Clark in 1992 and Ken Follett this year, but less than the mega-deals 
signed during the past few years by horror master Stephen King and romance 
writer Barbara Taylor Bradford. 
</P>
<P>
 Cussler, 63, a native of Illinois who grew up in Southern California and once 
ran a gas station, may be a byline familiar only to those who favor intricately 
plotted adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the sale of more than 60 million of his books in 30 languages 
reflects the enduring commercial appeal of his fictional action hero -- Dirk 
Pitt, an Air Force major who works with an underwater salvage company -- and 
underscores the importance of a franchise author to leading publishers.

 Buzz on Cool: "Cool is not the same thing as hot. Being the flavor of the 
month is a fine thing, but when it comes to cool, staying power is finer." 
</P>
<P>
 With this definition of L.A. cool, Buzz magazine presents the Buzz 100 in the 
October issue (on sale Sept. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 100 coolest people in town are cover boy John Malkovich and 
cine-legend Billy Wilder, Variety columnist Army Archerd and youthful TV star 
Sara Gilbert, James Garner and David Hockney. Funny man Albert Brooks is cool 
because "he doesn't need an audience." The 4-year-old L.A. magazine soon will 
raise (from 70,000) to 80,000 the circulation guaranteed to advertisers as it 
also looks into switching from monthly to biweekly frequency and launching its 
own imprint with a trade book publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the October book invites readers to order the premiere issue of 
Buzz Quarterly ("New Fiction From Los Angeles and Beyond"), which will be out 
in the spring.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; POLITICAL INTRIGUE TAKES A PERSONAL SPIN; JUBILEE BY 
ROBERT MCCRUM ; ALFRED A. KNOPF $22, 225 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the amusements of "Memories of the Ford Administration," John Updike's 
1992 novel, is the way in which two undistinguished U.S. Presidents -- Gerald 
Ford and James Buchanan -- were used as foils for the exploration of a 
professional historian's tumultuous life. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict and machinations of the political world mirrored, to a large 
degree, the more sophisticated schemes of everyday existence; and what proves 
overridingly important isn't military might and political shrewdness, but the 
basic problems and passions of existence, the simple humanity that even the 
rich and powerful can't escape.  
</P>
<P>
 British novelist Robert McCrum is up to similar things in "Jubilee," a fiction 
in which the ineffectual President's role is played by Jimmy Carter -- here 
often called, incongruously, the Old Man. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrum's protagonist is quite unlike Updike's scholarly Alfred Clayton, 
however, for Sam Gilchrist, a 36-year-old, half-English MBA-holding speech 
writer is more trendy than tweedy and holds suitably mass-market ambitions -- 
he aims, post-White House, to write not a life of James Buchanan but an 
implausibly high-tone Hollywood screenplay, "Shakespeare in Love." 
</P>
<P>
 That work lies in abeyance, though, while Gilchrist composes an apologia, 
which in Gilchrist's case is also an attempt to free an acquaintance from a 
fabricated murder charge. To Gilchrist the tale-telling is a "narrative cure," 
an exorcism of personal devils, and for him it seems effective . . . though the 
same cannot be said, unfortunately, of "Jubilee" itself.  
</P>
<P>
 Why do so many writers feel the need to inject thriller-genre elements into 
works conceived, apparently, as literary? The killing (of a bookseller, 
strangely) that sets the story of "Jubilee" in motion is patently a plot device 
intended to force Gilchrist to trace a mysterious political conspiracy to his 
high-ranking father, Admiral Sir Ronald Lefevre. The accused killer likewise 
exists primarily to advance the story -- Craig Marshall playing the good 
soldier framed by higher-ups for attempting to thwart the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 One hates to question an established writer's narrative choices -- this is 
McCrum's fifth novel -- but "Jubilee's" overall effect is significantly 
undermined by the melodrama surrounding Marshall's role. 
</P>
<P>
 The central theme of the novel is betrayal -- of women by men, of sons by 
fathers, of subordinates by superiors -- but McCrum paints the personal 
treacheries so much more vividly than the political that the latter seem like 
afterthoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 The disjointedness of Gilchrist's narration doesn't help matters: McCrum 
bounces back and forth in time, and withholds information in order to pique 
reader interest and create climactic portents, but the result, more often than 
not, is confusion. "Jubilee" works best, it turns out, when McCrum covers 
Updike's territory: 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist's affair with the Australian journalist Ruth, who is clearly too 
independent for him; the telephonic relationship with Lizzie, Gilchrist's 
resentful ex-wife; his inevitable deflation before his father, who reeks of 
unquestioned, unlimited authority; his half-bemused, half-amused recollections 
of youthful power -- in retrospect, only arrogance -- when Gilchrist could 
blithely say his boss was the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncoupled from baffling tales of murder and conspiracy, these scenes and 
subjects have energy and interest, and one wishes McCrum hadn't tried to 
shoehorn them into a thriller-espionage framework. 
</P>
<P>
 It requires great skill to fuse political and personal intrigues into the sort 
of sophisticated page-turners Graham Greene called "entertainments," and that 
skill is only intermittently present here.

HOW THE WEST WAS DRAWN; WORLD-CLASS EXHIBIT FROM THE GILCREASE COLLECTION

 "Western art," James Nottage mutters. "In some art circles, that's considered 
an oxymoron." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief curator at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum emphatically begs 
to differ. In Nottage's view there are great works of Western art, even great 
works of narrative Western art -- those often-despised pictures and sculptures 
that tell a story. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to prove Nottage's point, a major show of compelling Western art will 
open Saturday at the museum in Griffith Park. Called "Western Masters," the 
exhibit will feature treasures from one of the world's finest collections of 
art of the West -- that of the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Gilcrease, whose mother was of Creek Indian origin, was an oilman who 
personally amassed more than 350,000 Western artifacts and artworks before his 
death in 1962. Nearly 50 paintings and sculptures from that unparalleled cache 
will go on display, including important works by such major figures as Albert 
Bierstadt, Thomas Moran, Frederic Remington and Charles Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Nottage is thrilled that Angelenos will have a chance to study the Gilcrease 
treasures up close. "Not everybody can go to Tulsa to see this great 
collection," he notes. And many of the most important developments in Western 
art will be represented, from formal portraits of Indian leaders to 
heart-stopping landscapes that let Europeans know that the Rockies were every 
bit as majestic as the Alps, from roiling buffalo hunts to remarkably modern 
work by members of the Taos Society of Artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some critics, many Americans love Western art. The West is the great 
tragic stage of American expansion, its despoiled Eden, a place of almost 
infinite geographical and geological variety and a symbol -- all at one time -- 
of national ambition, hope and unspeakable loss. 
</P>
<P>
 As Canadian historian Brian Dippie writes in an insightful essay in "The 
Oxford History of the American West," critical fashions come and go but 
"Western art continues to appeal to rainbow-chasers everywhere." The Autry show 
brings together many of the works that shaped our collective vision of the 
West. Whatever the historical truth, the West we all know is the one created by 
artists such as Bierstadt and Russell (and film makers such as John Ford). The 
show could be called "How the West Was Made." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Certain subjects appear again and again in Western art -- Native Americans 
(depicted as doomed innocents or maniacal savages, depending on the decade and 
the artist's politics), mountains, mesas, cowboys and thousands and thousands 
of fierce and shaggy buffalo, our bizarre national beast. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important pictures in the show, according to Nottage, is John 
Mix Stanley's "Buffalo Hunt." Stanley was one of many Western artists who 
documented the visual West while traveling with an expedition surveying for a 
railroad. Stanley knew whereof he painted -- his canvas includes a 
self-portrait of the mighty hunter. Stanley's work is especially precious 
because it is so rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of his work was destroyed when the Smithsonian burned in 1865 and the 
Barnum collection burned the same year," says Nottage. The curator notes that 
the Autry has three Stanleys in its collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Heroic landscapes will be part of the show, including Albert Bierstadt's 
"Sierra Nevada Mountains in California," painted around 1863. For a time the 
German-born and -trained Bierstadt was so identified with stirring paintings of 
American peaks that a critic quipped that the artist had "copyrighted all the 
principal mountains." One of the surprises of the show is a Bierstadt seascape, 
"'Point Lobo, California," done in 1875.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Moran's paintings of Great Hot Springs and the Lower Falls in 
Yellowstone, both done in 1893, not only documented the look of the West, but 
also helped shape its history. The English-born Moran was part of a U.S. 
government-sponsored expedition to Yellowstone in 1871, and the images Moran 
produced from that experience helped persuade Congress to turn Yellowstone into 
the world's first national park the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another non-native artist who lovingly depicted the West was Henry Farny, who 
was born in France and trained in Europe before settling in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Farny's 1905 oil "Fording the Stream" shows a scene in the everyday life of the 
Indians who were vanishing even as Farny observed them as a young man. 
</P>
<P>
 The show will include little-known works, such as two tiny canvases painted by 
Walter Shirlaw, who recorded the cultures of the Northern Cheyenne and Crow as 
one of five official artists assigned to the census of American Indian tribes 
undertaken in 1890. "What's neat about Shirlaw is he was an early 
Impressionist, and these paintings are startling," Nottage says.  
</P>
<P>
 While the unexpected will be featured, the familiar will not be ignored. Both 
Frederic Remington and Charles Russell will have an honored place in the 
exhibit. Historian Dippie thinks that's a good thing, even a brave thing, given 
the critical disdain with which these artists are often regarded. Dippie 
recalls that a reporter once demanded that he tell her why she should like 
Russell's work. Dippie felt something akin to despair. "You can't defend any 
art when it's guilty until proven innocent," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dippie won't go so far as to describe the work of the two Rs as great, but it 
is, he maintains, extremely important art. The men were very different, he 
observes. Remington "championed the winning of the West, whereas Russell 
lamented all that was lost." They were opposed in their sympathies as well. 
Russell loved cowboys and Indians, while Remington was an equal-opportunity 
racist, whose views are reflected in his 1899 oil, "Missing." The title is an 
ominous reference to the status of the valiant soldier who appears in the 
center of the canvas, on foot, a rope around his neck, being led by a band of 
mounted Indians to what we know, with a shudder, will be a hideous death. 
</P>
<P>
 In their very different ways, Dippie says, Remington and Russell "represent 
the nub of the tradition, they really represent the core." Even now, when we 
think about the West, we tend to do so in the images created by these two men. 
It's fascinating, Dippie notes, "how strongly they impressed their vision on 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the durable legacy of Western art, Dippie cites the 
popularity of Kevin Costner's "Dances With Wolves," in which images straight 
out of Remington are recycled into something more in sync with contemporary 
values. "The key thing in Western art is that it provides all the images, and 
we can continue to translate them in terms of current concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Dippie is shamelessly fond of Russell, who is represented in the show by two 
bronzes, a sculpture of Will Rogers and one of an ursine "Mountain Mother," and 
two oils, "Wagon Boss" (1909) and "A Bad One" (1920). Dippie thinks the 
scornful fail to appreciate the power of Russell's enduringly popular work, 
which piles tumbleweed on buffalo skull until the authentic details accrete 
into "a vision of something lost and wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dippie is one of those who stands in front of a Russell painting and sees, not 
cowboys or Indians, cattle or wagon wheels, but a Western paradise that may 
never have existed anywhere except in the artist's mind. WHERE AND WHEN

SEPARATE BUT EQUAL; 'FROM QUEBEC' SHOWCASES THE UNIQUE INDIVIDUALITY OF SIX 
ARTISTS FROM THE CANADIAN PROVINCE, BUT THE WORKS ALSO CONVEY ASPECTS WITH A 
UNIVERSAL APPEAL. 
</P>

 The French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec will always have its own 
identity, regardless of whether it remains a part of Canada. But as one can see 
in the exhibit at Century Gallery, "From Quebec," contemporary artists from 
this province belong to an international art community that stretches beyond 
Canada and the United States to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Quebec" presents for the first time in Los Angeles the work of six 
artists. The show was partly funded by a grant from the Cultural Ministry of 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 24 pieces are paintings, drawings, prints and constructions that 
convey some of the universal interests of artists everywhere. Subject matter 
ranges from mankind's effect on the environment to finding a sense of self 
within one's environment. Traditional mediums have been adapted to fit personal 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been interested in art that is not so much in fashion, in artists 
that are marginal, singular, unique, who reflect their society but remain 
independent," said Ninon Gauthier, the Montreal curator of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the diversity that I see represented in the materials and 
approaches," said Lee Musgrave, director of Century Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody in Quebec is doing the same thing. There isn't one of these 
styles that seems to overpower the others. They're all equally visually 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Gauthier, in the exhibit catalogue that accompanies the show, writes: "These 
artists are indeed original and unique, but they have something in common; they 
share an attachment to intimacy and mystery, in their delicate contemplation of 
the precious and fragile passing of time and in the visionary introversion 
which alludes to the spiritual dimension of a work of art. . . . What all these 
works have in common is a symbolic dimension, accentuated by the omnipresence 
of drawing." 
</P>
<P>
 Painter and sculptor Marcel Barbeau, whose work in this show seems 
particularly engaging, has been exhibiting his art since the 1940s, when he was 
a member of an abstract Expressionist group, the Automatists. Today, his works 
can be found in most Canadian public art collections as well as at the National 
Gallery in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbeau's paintings, such as "De tes yeux aux miens" (From Your Eyes to Mine) 
present joyously colorful, irregular geometric forms that come together in a 
soft, harmonious way, giving a sense of delightful movement to each 
composition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laurent Bouchard's career began in the early 1980s, when he completed his 
master's degree in fine arts at the Universite du Quebec a Montreal. His 
geometric constructions seem to float on the walls to which they are attached. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Stratege orbitale" (Orbital Strategus) appears like a hot-air balloon 
ascending skyward. "Ponere" bobs along like a sailboat on the water, with the 
painted whirling cuplike forms of its body propelling it as it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic, Expressionist paintings by Giuseppe Fiore, who was born in 
Italy in 1931 and has lived in Quebec since 1952, are mostly abstract, but the 
figurative "Le bolide" (Hot Shot Car) depicts an attractive, sleek car and 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette Froment studied art at the Universite de Montreal in the late 1970s, 
and has been exhibiting her representational paintings since the early '80s. 
Her round acrylic on canvas "Exploitation du patrimoine" (Exploitation of 
Heritage) portrays small men and a large vehicle set against the rocks of 
earth, calling into question man's treatment of the Earth as well as man's 
treatment of man. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Joubert's current focus is on environmental issues, after first being 
associated with the feminist art movement of the early '70s. She grew up in a 
Montreal suburb and received her master's degree in fine arts from the 
Universite du Quebec a Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 If one merely glances at her "Red Alarm," one takes in the colors of the fall 
season. A closer look offers a significantly less enchanting notion: a forest 
ablaze, the flames billowing out of control. The bones of a bird lie in a box 
attached to the acrylic on wood painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foret a intervalle" (Spaced-Out Forest) is not the healthiest of forests 
either, with its ghostly, almost surreal tree trunks, which have a tenuous 
connection, at best, to the earth below. 
</P>
<P>
 Printmaker Louis Pelletier completed his art education at the Ecole des 
beaux-arts de Montreal in the late 1960s before apprenticing with two 
printmakers, one of whom specialized in the mezzotint process. His large, 
complex mezzotint, "Structure anatomique I & II" (Anatomical Structure), took 
first prize at this year's International Print Biennial in Poland. WHERE AND 
WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "From Quebec." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Century Gallery, 13000 Sayre St., Sylmar.

DINING OVER ROCK 'N' ROLLS; EAST AND WEST MEET -- AND MERGE -- AT A SUSHI BAR 
WHERE PATRONS SOMETIMES DANCE ON THE CHAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To many it's known simply as rock 'n' roll sushi, an adventure in rhythm and 
roe that has managed to find a point of conjunction between tooth-rattling 
American music and the traditional Japanese dining experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo Delve's Sushi Bar is probably the only place around where the customers 
routinely drop their eel to climb up on the chairs and dance among the 
artificial stars that shine through the pasteboard rainbows hanging from the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreamed up by Japanese businessman Tani Yuichi, whose middle name is Delve, 
which he points out is English for deep thinking, this sushi bar is every bit 
as warped a blending of American and Japanese sensibilities as Gammera the 
atomic flying turtle. 
</P>
<P>
 And just about as much cross-cultural fun, judging by the crowds waiting 
outside on the street many weekend nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are both mourning the loss of our boyfriends, so it was a great place," 
said Carlene Jones, 41, of Van Nuys as she emerged smiling from the 
nondescript-looking restaurant on Lankershim Boulevard. Even outside, the disco 
rhythms exploding from the sound system, which Yuichi says proudly is the same 
one they employ in the Captain Eo exhibit in Disneyland, reverberated like 
small-ordinance fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best sushi place ever," added her friend, Melinda Hayes, 19, of 
Van Nuys, who disputed Jones' characterization of their romantic plight, saying 
she still had hopes for her relationship. As for the food, she had just 
returned from Japan and thinks Tokyo Delve's has better sushi. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuichi, 52, was a successful businessman in Tokyo before moving everything to 
the United States a decade ago. He wanted to start a business here but was not 
sure what would attract American customers. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his "project team" mulled things over for months. Finally, they had a 
brainstorm: combining the best of Japanese entertaining with American popular 
music. "The idea is for the customer," Yuichi said in careful English, "to make 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a relatively small restaurant along an unimpressive row of storefronts 
in North Hollywood, not far from the Eagle's coffeehouse, where musicians and 
storytellers entertain customers reclining on old sofas. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Tokyo Delve's looks a little like the It's A Small World exhibit gone 
Vegas showroom, complete with dancing and singing waiters. Besides the dangling 
rainbows, there are cut-outs of palm trees in pastel colors, and a small 
sailboat hangs behind the bar. The only thing missing is the bobbing-head dolls 
mercilessly repeating their cheerful refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more games of chance than at a carnival. At 7, 9, and 11 p.m., a 
Lucky Lamp spotlight circles the room. Whoever is in its beam when the song 
ends wins a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Any customer spending more than $40 can spin a wheel to win a dish. Dinner 
salad seemed especially popular with the fates one recent night, and several 
people won urns of hot sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers also can throw darts at a small green star behind the bar to win a 
beer. To participate, however, you must have already had three beers, thus 
guaranteeing you will be too debilitated to hit the star, and maybe the wall, 
given the size of the Sapporos they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to spot the drinkers in the crowd, because every time they bring out 
one of the 21.4-ounce Sapporos, the waiters all cheer, "Hey, Sapporo!" After 
the third one, which you were only having to try your hand at the dartboard, 
you can begin to feel a bit self-conscious, as though they were not celebrating 
your good taste but exposing your profligacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The men in headsets behind the counter orchestrate the food and the 
entertainment. They cheer every customer who comes in the door, causing some 
people to duck their heads shyly. But, being Americans, many others fling their 
arms up in victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the music, however -- all taped, all popular, and all at levels that 
make conversation a challenge -- that makes Tokyo Delve's an experience. At 
least once a night, according to regulars, right around the time they turn on 
the Lucky Lamp and put "Reggae Dancing" on the sound system, everybody in the 
place climbs up on their chairs and begins swaying like eucalyptus trees in a 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuichi is aware of the tradition. "Very dangerous on the table," he added. To 
say nothing of the threat to the California rolls. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: Tokyo Delve's Sushi Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 5239 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Time To Go: 6 p.m. to midnight Monday to Saturday, except Friday, when they 
rock till 2 a.m. Weekend nights are best. Make sure to reserve, or you may find 
yourself waiting out on the street for as long as an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Reasonable, from $15 to $30 a person, or more if you really want to 
sample. The big Sapporos are $4.90 each.

KING OF THE HILL; UP AT CITYWALK, BLUES AND DELTA CUISINE SPICE UP B. B. KING'S 
NEW MEMPHIS-STYLE CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran bluesman Rufus Thomas stood on a terrace over the starkly modern 
courtyard at Universal CityWalk, a world away from his Memphis roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blues and barbecue," he mused on a recent summer afternoon. "You like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing about his surroundings suggested such fare. But one of Thomas' best 
friends, the legendary B. B. King, has opened a nightclub amid the tourist 
trappings at CityWalk. To step through the club's wood-and-glass doors is to 
step into another world. 
</P>
<P>
 B. B. King's Blues Club looks like an old opera house with garish New Orleans 
touches, purple curtains and gold accents. Tables, walls and floors are 
fashioned of dark wood. The place has a close-up feel, with steep balconies 
that hover above a wide stage. 
</P>
<P>
 On that stage, musicians like Thomas find a new home in Los Angeles. The 
499-seat house promises nightly blues and R & B performances by local and 
touring acts. Every Sunday brings a Southern gospel brunch. All of this is 
accompanied by helpings of Mississippi Delta cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fried dill pickles and catfish," King explained on a recent stop in town. "We 
want it to be a good-time place." 
</P>
<P>
 The club officially celebrates its debut with all-star performances Tuesday 
and Wednesday. "B. B.'s Birthday Party" will feature King himself, joined by 
unannounced musical guests. Bonnie Raitt and Mavis Staples, among others, have 
shown up at his birthday parties in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week also marks the opening of Lucille's, an adjacent cafe named for the 
bluesman's trademark Gibson guitar. The 85-seat room will feature acoustic 
acts, the kind of music that King insists is "the core of the blues and R & B." 
</P>
<P>
 What with the recent opening of the House of Blues in West Hollywood, this has 
been a good year for such music in Los Angeles. Long relegated to small clubs, 
it now rings from two shiny platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, King never intended to bring his act here. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, MCA recorded an album of live blues at a club he owns in 
Memphis and corporate executives took a liking to the place. It stands on Beale 
Street, infamous for its juke joints and pawn shops, establishments that once 
harbored not only blues but illegal gambling. Underground tunnels that gamblers 
used to escape police raids still exist.  
</P>
<P>
 King first gained prominence in this neighborhood. Arriving in Memphis with 
his guitar and $2.50, he performed with Bobby Bland, Johnny Ace and Earl 
Forrest in a group called The Beale Streeters. Known by his given name, Riley 
B. King, he also worked as a disc jockey and acquired the moniker "Beale Street 
Blues Boy," which in time was shortened to "Blues Boy" and then to B. B. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beale Street was where it all started for me," King said. "That's where it 
all came from." 
</P>
<P>
 His club opened four years ago and quickly became a favored nightspot along 
that road. Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney have dropped by. Bette Midler, 
recently in Memphis for a concert, climbed on stage for an impromptu jam 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 So MCA asked King and managing partner Tommy Peters if they could duplicate 
the feat in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 The CityWalk version offers as much of Memphis as the owners could muster. 
Woodworkers were flown west to construct the elaborate bars that serve each of 
the club's three floors. Black-and-white photographs honor such Memphis 
recording greats as Otis Redding, Al Green and Booker T. and the MGs. The walls 
on the second floor are painted the exact blue that graced the interior of the 
famous Stax Records studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the place -- its music -- takes a cue from King, whose formative 
years in Memphis led him to blend traditional blues with jazz, pop and jump 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
 On weeknights at his club, the house band works its eclectic way from John Lee 
Hooker to Aretha Franklin to Stevie Ray Vaughn. Local veteran Arthur Adams and 
Jeannie Holliday front the eight-piece group that infuses such music with the 
upbeat and brassy Memphis sound of blues and soul. The horn section keeps 
things joyful while singers engage the audience in call-and-response. 
</P>
<P>
 This club lacks the size to attract top-name acts on a consistent basis. 
Still, the likes of Maria Muldaur, Tinsley Ellis and Little Charlie and the 
Nightcats are scheduled to perform on weekend nights in the coming months. 
Sunday evenings will bring a rotating diet of Motown and New Orleans bands. And 
King will visit a half a dozen times each year. When he plays in Memphis, 
well-known guests often sit in. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the club will try to maintain a loose feel. Clyde Avant, a master 
of ceremonies brought from the original club, warms the crowd with rapid-fire 
patter. The food -- be it the blackened catfish or the Louisiana gumbo -- is 
tasty and reasonably priced. When the waitresses and waiters find themselves 
with a spare moment, they drag customers onto a small dance floor. "This is not 
necessarily a concert hall, it's a hangout," King said. "We're not cool. We 
just want to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Rufus Thomas couldn't agree more. The way he sees it, such casual good times 
were a long time coming in the land of hip. 
</P>
<P>
 As he put it, "You can't lose with the stuff we use." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>

EXPANDING ON A JAZZ VISION; FLUTIST PEDRO EUSTACHE WILL BRING WHAT HE DESCRIBES 
AS HIS 'NEW LATIN' STYLE TO LE CAFE IN SHERMAN OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After several years of solid success as a classical flutist in his native Cara 
cas, Pedro Eustache knew in the mid-'80s that it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing recitals, studio work, playing in the Caracas Symphonietta, the 
Venezuela Symphony, and teaching at a conservatory, when I felt this huge void, 
which was the power to compose instantaneously, that a jazz player has," says 
Eustache, 35, who has lived in Southern California since the late '80s. "The 
'now' nature of the music prompted me to put more emphasis on improvised music. 
The creativity drew me." 
</P>
<P>
 So Eustache, influenced by such diverse jazz reed artists as Eric Dolphy, 
Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman and James Newton, started expanding his musical 
visions, incorporating the improvised sounds that were sparking him. 
</P>
<P>
 He ultimately decided to come to the United States to study with Newton at 
CalArts in Valencia. There Eustache -- who earned a diploma in flute 
performance from the Hector Berlioz Conservatory in Paris in 1983 -- received 
bachelor and master of fine arts degrees in jazz studies in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances with everyone from singer Donovan and contemporary Latin artist 
Alex Acuna and his band, the Unknowns, to free-thinking pianist Larry Karush 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creative expression of music has made me, I believe, a much more 
complete musician, not just an instrumentalist. It's like speaking different 
languages, which makes you more complete in terms of communication," says 
Eustache, who speaks Spanish, English, French, Haitian Creole and a "little 
Portuguese." 
</P>
<P>
 With each language, Eustache says, you get the idiosyncrasies of a culture, 
"its way of living, of thinking. With different forms of music, it's the same 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 A man in search of still fresher horizons, Eustache says that although he 
enjoys his performances interpreting a variety of Latin-based music with Acuna, 
violinist Susie Hansen and others, he seeks something different. For his 
appearance Sunday at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, Eustache is going to present what 
he calls "new Latin jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 "This music is not as strictly Afro-Cuban-based Latin jazz, like Susie's," 
says Eustache. "It's coming from another background -- my background -- so it's 
mostly Afro-Venezuelan. Venezuela has a lot of tradition, a lot of rhythms, and 
these are less known" than the Afro-Cuban rhythms that have been at the root of 
Latin jazz since trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie incorporated Latin beats with be-bop 
in the late 1940s. "I want to mix this Afro-Venezuelan music, and maybe some 
Afro-Uruguayan, but not Brazilian or Cuban, with improvised jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Eustache, a soft-spoken, unassuming man, says he doesn't see this new 
direction as anything to thump his chest about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to do something different, so I'm exploring this new passion, but 
without the arrogance of considering myself an innovator," he says. "I just 
want to have some fun." 
</P>
<P>
 At Le Cafe, Eustache will be accompanied by an outstanding crew, including 
Ramon Stagnaro (guitars), Walter Rodriguez (drums), Dave Carpenter (bass) and 
guest Ottmaro Ruiz (keyboards). 
</P>
<P>
 He says he'll offer a few classic standards along with his personal style of 
Latin music. If he plays half as strongly as he does when he appears with 
Hansen, it seems sure he'll get the joint jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pedro has a real spark to his playing," says Hansen, who used Eustache's 
talents on her debut CD, "Solo Flight" on Jazz Caliente Records. "There's a 
fire and energy in him that never fails me." 
</P>
<P>
 Eustache's roots in classical music run deep. He started on recorder at age 9, 
then added flute at 14. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied flute in Europe with two noted teachers -- Ramon Guiot in France 
and Aurele Nicolet in Switzerland -- and on his return to Venezuela became 
principal flutist in several ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that although he no longer plays classical music, "combining the 
classical techniques with the Venezuelan and the jazz -- that's my voice."

THEATER REVIEW; 'WIVES' HONESTLY FUNNY; PLAY IS LIKE A SITCOM. BUT REALISTIC 
COMIC TIMING AND AUTHENTIC HUMOR ADD SOMETHING EXTRA. 
</P>

<P>
 Rosie Taravella's "The Wives," at Ventura Court Theatre, looks an awful lot 
like a pilot for a TV sitcom. But there's a little bit more to it than that 
and, in its final scene, a little bit less. 
</P>
<P>
 The setup is simple. The husbands, all employees of Blake Advertising, are off 
for their annual fishing trip. Nancy Clancy decides the wives should get 
together for a first annual luncheon just to get to know one another, and for 
various covert other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five equal roles for five strong actresses (and one pure sitcom 
mini-romp for a young actor). As usual in this type of play, the five women are 
as different as can be. Nancy (Christy Noonan) is a typical housewife and an 
ex-career woman waiting till the kids are gone so she can get back to work. 
Barb (Patricia Tallman) is pregnant again and not thrilled with it, nor with 
discussion of her drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive ex-flower child Ingrid (Kendall Hailey), who insists on using her 
maiden name, quotes Gertrude Stein and has marriage problems of her own, while 
brittle-witted Jeri (playwright Taravella), on her third husband named Fred, is 
struggling as an aging television commercial actress and upset because her 
teen-age son is back in Juvenile Hall. The final member of this familiar motley 
crew is Heidi (Erin McLaughlin), the bimbotic fiancee of the firm's biggest 
moneymaker, proud as punch of her breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 What places "The Wives" in a slightly different groove than network-type 
sitcom is that the writing is not just funny, it's often witty. Taravella has a 
nifty knack for letting the characters breed the real humor, rather than 
relying on one-liners. Her wives are honestly drawn, and they speak with 
authentic voices. And the actresses who play them are strong across the board 
and have a solid understanding of the honest humor in the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The just-right comic timing of the production is director Charles Nelson 
Reilly's work. He knows the realistic rhythms that are inherent in the script, 
where the builds are that lead to laughs, and how to honestly reach those 
peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Alessi is funny albeit a bit overboard as a young actor who, 
dressed as a gondolier, delivers pizza. But it is in his final scene that the 
writing suddenly arcs back to the wild-and-crazy, anything-for-a-laugh '60s, 
with a denouement to match. It is out of sync with the rest of the writing and 
a little jarring. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "The Wives."  
</P>
<P>
 Location: Ventura Court Theatre, 12417 Ventura Court, Studio City.

COVER STORY; PREVIEW OF COMING ATTRACTIONS; CINEMA CHAINS MAY LAUNCH THE WAR OF 
THE MULTIPLEXES IN THE WEST VALLEY. IF THE PLANNED SCREENS ARE BUILT, IT COULD 
BE GOOD NEWS FOR MOVIEGOERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several of the nation's largest cinema chains are threatening to turn the west 
San Fernando Valley into a battleground, pitting new multiplexes against 
existing theaters in a high-stakes clash. 
</P>
<P>
 And moviegoers could emerge as the biggest winners. 
</P>
<P>
 If exhibitors such as AMC Theatres and Pacific Theatres make good on recently 
announced plans, the number of screens in and around Woodland Hills would 
increase from 16 to more than 50. Movie marquees would abound and new theaters 
would feature up-to-date amenities. But industry experts wonder if there are 
enough viewers to fill so many seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be highly competitive," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor 
Relations, a Los Angeles consulting group. "One (cinema) would cannibalize the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Theatres is scheduled to wade into the fray first, announcing the 
Christmas, 1995, opening of a 20-screen complex at Victory and Topanga Canyon 
boulevards. One block south, at the Promenade mall, AMC has received 
preliminary approval for a 16-screen project. Meanwhile, a mile away, the 
General Cinema at Fallbrook Mall will expand from seven to 10 screens in 1995 
and United Artists is considering changes to its six-screen complex in Warner 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, it's good," said Rana Linka, a neighborhood resident 
and board member of the West Hills Property Owners Assn. "With more theaters, 
there will be more competition. Maybe ticket prices will go down and we will 
have a wider array of movies to see." 
</P>
<P>
 West Hills residents are not alone in hearing the clatter of movie projectors 
on the horizon. Granada Hills will get a new nine-screen Mann Theatre in 
mid-December. The Calabasas City Council has approved plans for a Mann 8 at Las 
Virgenes and Agoura roads and has been considering a hotly debated proposal for 
a United Artists eight-screen complex at Parkway Calabasas and Calabasas Road. 
Agoura Hills officials also are studying plans for a development that would 
include a multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of these communities have felt the industry fervor that has descended 
upon the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is one of the best zones in the entire metropolitan area," said 
Dick Walsh, a senior vice president for AMC. "The population is strong, there 
are high moviegoing demographics and good disposable income, all the things you 
look for in a movie theater location." 
</P>
<P>
 General Cinema, United Artists and Pacific are the only three cinemas 
currently operating in the area. So, industry experts said, expansion was 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these companies recognized that this area was underdeveloped, and they 
all started working on projects at the same time," said Tim Warner, president 
of the National Assn. of Theatre Owners of California and Nevada. "The number 
of proposed screens far exceeds the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie theater industry divides itself into zones, areas with sufficient 
population to support a cluster of theaters. In rural areas, a zone might 
extend 15 miles. In a densely populated suburb, it might encompass only a few 
square miles. Traditionally, the industry has assumed that each zone will 
support from 13 to 24 screens. Proposed developments in the West Valley would 
double that standard. 
</P>
<P>
 This flurry of interest comes at a time of unprecedented box office success. 
Fed by hits such as "Forrest Gump" and "The Lion King," the summer of 1994 
could eclipse last summer with as much as $2.2 billion in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But audiences are not the only consideration when it comes to building a 
theater. There are a limited number of movies to go around. If a new Arnold 
Schwarzenegger film opens at one complex, for instance, it will not appear at 
neighboring cinemas. Chains must compete for desired titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their past relationship with the distributor is important," Krier said. "And 
their past performance with grosses." 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of unusually heated competition in the West Valley leads some 
experts to suspect that Pacific and the other chains have entered into an 
expensive game of chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual that these types of situations occur within the industry," 
Warner said. "The companies are not allowed, because of antitrust laws, to talk 
to each other while these projects are in the early stages of development. They 
can't call their competitor and say, 'Are you working on a project in this 
area?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently, when the projects were publicly announced, did opposing chains 
see the full picture. Warner predicts that one or more of the companies might 
back off. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 20 years ago no one would have dared to suggest building so many 
theaters so near each other. The industry used to adhere to a "clearance" 
standard with zones that extended seven miles between theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of clearance," Krier muses. "It's practically nonexistent now." 
</P>
<P>
 The change took place in increments. Cinemas were built closer and closer 
together. Existing theaters added more and more screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Topanga, for instance, began as a single-screen theater in 1968. 
It added a second screen in 1972 and a third in 1992. It has 925 seats. The new 
complex will cover 70,000 square feet and include 4,500 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Such changes have forced theaters to alter their relationships with studios. 
In the past, chains held exclusive rights to show a particular studio's 
first-run movies. These pacts, to some degree, have fallen by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, the Baldwin Hills Theater sued Mann and Warner Bros., claiming that 
the defendants unfairly restrained trade by barring film distributors from 
playing a film at the Baldwin if Mann had booked the movie in one of its 
Westwood theaters nine miles away. A 1984 settlement allowed the Baldwin equal 
access to first-run films. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar disputes could arise in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it would create economic hardships in the market area because of the 
lack of the number of films and the potential audience," Warner explained. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if all the proposed theaters are built, Linka and her 
neighbors would enjoy a wider selection of films. This would be especially true 
with foreign and specialized movies. At this point, only the Laemmle Town 
Center 5 in Encino plays art films on a regular basis. At AMC, Walsh said that 
West Valley residents are sophisticated enough to support such films. And 
Pacific is eager to provide yet another outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to bring a lot of product that hasn't been played in the area 
before," said Chan Wood, the chain's head film buyer. "There will be more 
art-type product and the bigger picture, the so-called 'Forrest Gump,' will 
play longer. There will be multiple screens and multiple show times." 
</P>
<P>
 New multiplexes also would feature such popular amenities as 70-millimeter 
projection, advanced sound systems and ATM ticket dispensers. Officials at the 
Promenade mall are anxious to add splashy technology. At their mall, the 
proposed 60,000-square-foot AMC multiplex would include digital sound in every 
theater. It would also abut a new food court and a bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just look at the area, we don't have the concentration of theaters 
that you might see on the Westside or other parts of the city," said Kim 
Solomon, the Promenade's general manager. "We're hopeful (the AMC theaters) 
will increase traffic through the mall." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only time will tell if this and other proposals come to pass. When asked about 
the future, Mann Theatres spokesman Bill Hertz unleashes a string of "no 
comments." At United Artists -- where management will not discuss its plans -- 
spokesman Bill Quigley admits to being concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it's going to be an incredibly competitive zone," Quigley said. 
"Sometimes theaters are announced and not built. Personally, I'm keeping my 
fingers crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is backing off. AMC officials say they are anxious to obtain 
building permits and are pointing toward a summer 1995 opening. Pacific seems 
intent on leading the frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proceeding on a very, very fast track," said Milton Moritz, a spokesman 
for the chain. "We can only speak from our standpoint. We feel there are 
certainly enough people in the area to serve our new complex." 
</P>
<P>
 And residents are keeping their fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there might be some second-guessing (within the industry)," said Bob 
Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. "But for us, 
it's a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1) General Cinema is currently a seven-screen complex. It plans to expand to 
10 screens by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The Pacific Topanga is currently a 925-seat triplex. By 1995 it will debut 
as a 20-screen, 4,500-seat complex. 
</P>
<P>
 3) AMC will replace the old Saks Fifth Avenue building at the Promenade mall, 
including a 16-screen theater, a food court and bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 4) United Artists operates a six-screen complex nearby. The chain is 
considering changes.

WILSON WOULD EXPEL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM SCHOOLS; POLITICS: SAYING STATE 
CAN'T AFFORD TO EDUCATE THEM, HE CLARIFIES STAND ON PROP. 187. BROWN CHARGES 
HYPOCRISY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Answering a question he has avoided for more than a year, Gov. Pete Wilson 
said Thursday that he would favor expelling illegal immigrants from the public 
schools if the U.S. Supreme Court allows it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor said the state cannot afford the estimated $1.5 
billion it costs to educate more than 300,000 illegal immigrants now attending 
kindergarten through 12th-grade classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot educate every child from here to Tierra del Fuego," Wilson said at 
a news conference in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the Republican governor has backed Proposition 187 -- an 
anti-illegal immigration measure on the November ballot -- but until Thursday 
had not taken a stand on the initiative's most explosive provisions, which 
would bar illegal immigrants from the state's schools and require educators to 
check on the citizenship status of all students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had said he favored the measure as a way to provoke a legal challenge 
to a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from denying illegal 
immigrants a public education. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed Thursday to explain what he would do if the Supreme Court upheld 
the initiative, Wilson said: "We implement the law." 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokeswoman later clarified the governor's comments, saying Wilson 
would prefer to see Proposition 187 coupled with a stronger federal effort to 
deport illegal immigrants so that children barred from schools do not remain in 
this country. But ultimately, the aide said, the governor supports the 
education provisions of the proposition as written. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's comments came as the immigration issue re-emerged at the forefront of 
his reelection campaign against Democrat Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown opposes Proposition 187. Removing children from the schools, she said 
Thursday, would be likely to result in "more trouble, more gangs, more guns, 
more graffiti and more cost to the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Latino leaders reacted with anger to the governor's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is surprising is the depth of his strike against innocent children," 
said Amin David, president of Los Amigos de Orange County. "They're here 
because of their parents and essentially they are the innocent victims. This is 
his meanness, the mean-spirited side of the governor showing through." 
</P>
<P>
 Another community leader, Arturo Montez, president of the Santa Ana chapter of 
the League of United Latin American Citizens, said Wilson's reference to 
"Tierra del Fuego" -- Land of the Flames -- smacks of "bigotry, hate and 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting," Montez said, "that here was the guy who, when he was the 
mayor of San Diego, didn't have any problem with people from Tierra del Fuego. 
And, when he was (U.S.) senator and the crops were rotting in the fields and 
there was no people to pick crops in California, they went to Tierra del Fuego 
for help. And, when he's behind in the polls, he again goes to Tierra del 
Fuego. But this time, he puts things in the fuego (flame)." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Wilson's use of immigration as a campaign issue, David praised 
Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who presides in a state that also borders Mexico, but 
"has not any of the so-called problems that California has." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson "should visit Mexico," David said, "and understand how the economies of 
Mexico and California are intertwined. In Texas, they have a tremendous number 
of miles of border, but they do not raise the same specter of proposed law. 
Instead, they find ways of working together." 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund program 
manager in Santa Ana, said, "the danger is that while politicians like the 
governor fight about numbers, it's still the California taxpayer who loses if 
187 passes. I said this because regardless of the actual cost of legal or 
illegal immigration might be, it would pale by comparison, if (the measure) 
passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacio said passage of the initiative would mean an estimated $15 billion 
loss in existing state and federal funds for such things as education and 
welfare, the equivalent of an additional $1,600 tax for every California 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning Thursday in Los Angeles, Brown stepped up her charge that Wilson 
has been a hypocrite on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 She cited letters that Wilson, then a U.S. senator, wrote in 1987 to President 
Ronald Reagan and his attorney general, Edwin Meese, complaining that the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service was making it too difficult for Mexican 
farm workers to enter the country to pick crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also blasted Wilson for trying now to curtail health services to illegal 
immigrants even though he voted as a senator to provide them. And she showed an 
informational videotape featuring Wilson in which the state encourages 
non-citizens to apply for government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson votes to impose health care mandates -- and now he campaigns 
against them," Brown said. "He cut a hole in the fence to allow millions of 
illegal immigrants in, and now he wants to patch that hole because that's what 
the polls tell him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aides, in response, said he favored a stricter guest worker program 
when he was a senator but had to settle for the weaker version drafted by 
Democrats in the House of Representatives. He wrote the letters, they said, 
because California farmers faced a severe labor shortage.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson on Thursday also signed legislation cracking down on immigration fraud, 
prohibiting the issuance of state contracts to companies convicted of hiring 
illegal immigrants, and easing the transfer of illegal immigrant felons from 
state prisons to federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference, Wilson spoke at length about Proposition 187, which he 
has said he will vote for but has yet to formally endorse. The measure would 
prohibit the delivery of public services, except emergency medical care, to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is opposed by the California Teachers Assn., the California 
Medical Assn., some law enforcement groups and business associations, which say 
the measure is too extreme. However, a Los Angeles Times poll this week found 
wide public support for it, with 62% of likely voters saying they favor passage 
of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has tried to walk a fine line on the education issue. Although he has 
complained about the cost of educating illegal immigrants since early 1993, the 
governor has refused to say whether he personally favored kicking out of school 
those children who are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Wilson again tried to deflect the question by asserting that the 
federal government, not the state, would ultimately decide how to handle those 
children. But when asked to state his personal opinion, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, I think, there has to be a clear line drawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson noted that federal law for eight years has required employers to verify 
the legal status of those they hire and said he believes the same standard 
should apply to public services. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 were upheld, Wilson said, he would "institute some kind of 
orderly process of determining who was legally in school or what parents were 
or were not legal and begin that kind of deportation that is necessary."

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that four oil companies 
have agreed to pay $18 million to settle a lawsuit over the long-delayed 
cleanup of the McColl toxic waste dump in Fullerton, created during World War 
II. 
</P>

 The payment by Shell Oil Co., Atlantic Richfield Co., Union Oil Co. of 
California and Texaco Inc., will reimburse the state and federal governments 
for past costs associated with preparing for the cleanup of the 22-acre McColl 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 While the settlement is a significant step in the complex litigation over the 
cleanup effort, the dispute over McColl is far from over. The oil companies are 
waging a countersuit to determine if the federal government should also pay 
part of the cleanup costs, which could reach $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. EPA is pleased the oil companies have recognized their 
responsibility at this site," Jeff Zelikson, the agency's regional hazardous 
waste management division director, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the oil companies reimburse the government for the $18 
million spent between 1980 and mid-1990 to secure the dump and explore cleanup 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA deemed McColl a major toxic problem in 1979, and added it to the 
federal Superfund priority list of toxic cleanup sites in September, 1983. A 
fence has been built around the area and a security guard is posted to keep out 
intruders while debate continues over how to proceed with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The site, in a once-remote area in Fullerton, is where about 100,000 cubic 
yards of petroleum waste were discarded in the 1940s, later to be covered by 
oil drilling muds and topsoil. Eventually, the area became part of the Los 
Coyotes Country Club golf course. In the 1970s the golf course was shouldered 
by homes, whose buyers complained of strong smells that caused headaches, and 
of black goo that oozed into their back yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Settlement terms order $13.25 million to go to the EPA and $4.75 million to 
the state to replenish the Superfund account to pay for cleaning up other 
contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement prevents the McColl site from becoming an expensive orphan 
that consumes millions of dollars from the state and federal treasuries," said 
William F. Soo Hoo, director of the California Department of Toxic Substances 
Control.  
</P>
<P>
 Participating in the announcement of the agreement were the U.S. Department of 
Justice, the U.S. attorney's office and the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement figures, which were contained in a consent decree filed 
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, represent a compromise, 
according to EPA officials, who originally sought $25 million from the oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Ritter, assistant regional counsel for EPA in San Francisco, said the 
agency is negotiating with McAuley LCX Corp., owner of Los Coyotes Country 
Club, to pay the $7-million difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlement negotiations between EPA and the oil companies began after the 
district court ruled in September, 1993, that the oil companies were legally 
liable to pay for cleaning up the wastes they deposited at McColl in World War 
II during the production of aviation fuel. Until then, the oil companies had 
denied responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Duchie, spokesman for the oil companies, said Thursday that the firms 
will proceed with a countersuit contending that financial liability for the 
total cleanup should be shared by the federal government since the dump was 
created as part of the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchie said the oil companies agreed to put up funds for the past costs 
"because we want to move directly into the issue of what portion of liability 
can be assessed to the U.S. government."  
</P>
<P>
 If the federal government is found partly responsible, Duchie said, the oil 
companies will seek to recover a portion of the $18 million they have now 
pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA and oil company officials contend that the legal wrangling over financial 
responsibility is not what has been delaying cleanup efforts at McColl. 
</P>
<P>
 However, A. Richard Olquin, spokesman for the Fullerton Hills Community Assn., 
which represents homeowners in the vicinity of the former dump, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts have had to force the parties involved to make decisions on paper 
about what should be done and the delay increases the cost. There is money 
being spent every day at McColl," Olquin complained. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1978, Olquin recalled, owners of homes abutting the dump site in 
Fullerton complained of odors and ooze emanating from 12 sumps filled with 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years the EPA has evaluated and discarded a variety of proposed 
cleanup approaches, including removal and incineration of the waste, as too 
costly or hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, the EPA decided to go ahead with a plan to solidify and 
neutralize the waste by mixing it with a cement-like material, but feasibility 
studies of the process are still underway. Ritter said the oil companies, under 
orders from the EPA, are designing the cleanup effort. A large-scale field test 
of the procedures is scheduled in November. Ritter said he expects the cleanup 
to be completed in four to six years.

ACTION BY PUC ALTERS PHONE RATE STRUCTURE; DEREGULATION: TOLL CALL CHARGES WILL 
FALL AS THAT MARKET IS OPENED TO COMPETITION. BUT LOCAL BASIC FEES WILL RISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a long-awaited ruling that will dramatically alter telephone pricing in 
California, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday opened so-called 
local long-distance calling to competition beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the policy change, the commission approved a substantial increase 
in basic local service charges -- some GTE customers' rates will climb as much 
as 80%. But prices for local long-distance, or toll calls -- defined as calls 
between points more than 12 miles apart but within local calling regions -- 
will plummet as long-distance companies such as AT & T and MCI enter a market 
currently reserved for Pacific Bell and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial decision -- which caps seven years of tempestuous hearings 
and deliberations -- is the first step in the arduous process of deregulating 
telecommunications in California, which lags far behind most of the nation in 
promoting phone service competition. The commission actually delivered a final 
ruling on toll calling a year ago, but was forced to rescind it after it was 
learned that a Pacific Bell employee helped write it. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Thursday's ruling drew criticism from most of those involved in 
the telephone regulation process: Consumer groups decried the local service 
rate increases, long-distance carriers complained about cumbersome access codes 
that customers will have to dial to use a carrier other than the local phone 
company, and Pacific Bell and GTE -- though generally pleased with the ruling 
-- grumbled about not getting the changes they sought. Pacific Bell had wanted 
to cut toll rates further while GTE was concerned that increases in basic rates 
were insufficient.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the utilities commission, more than half of California's 
residential customers will end up paying more for phone service under its new 
rate structure, with GTE customers having bigger increases than Pacific Bell 
customers. The median phone bill will rise 2% for Pacific Bell customers and 
16% for GTE customers, and consumers will face a confusing array of new choices 
for local long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Large businesses, and anyone who makes a lot of local long-distance calls, can 
look forward to substantially lower bills. Calls between Los Angeles and 
Riverside, for example, or between Anaheim and Santa Monica are toll calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, a daytime call from Anaheim to downtown Los Angeles 
through Pacific Bell would drop 44% -- from 28 cents for the first minute and 
19 cents each subsequent minute to 16 cents for the first minute and 11 cents 
each additional minute. 
</P>
<P>
 And a 93-cent, three-minute daytime call from Costa Mesa to Crestline in the 
San Bernardino Mountains would drop to 52 cents, while a daytime five-minute 
call from Costa Mesa to downtown Los Angeles would fall to 67 cents from $1.19. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in basic service is designed to offset revenues Pacific Bell and 
GTE are expected to lose when they surrender their monopolies in the $3-billion 
local long-distance market. The monthly flat rate for Pacific Bell residential 
customers will increase 35% to $11.25 from $8.35. For GTE customers, the 
monthly flat rate will leap 54% to $17.25 from $11.20. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consumer is getting the shaft here," said Audrie Krause, executive 
director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a San Francisco-based advocacy 
group. The hardest-hit group will be the estimated 20% to 30% of phone 
customers who don't make toll calls monthly, mostly elderly people or working 
poor who don't qualify for discounted lifeline rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that make many toll calls will be the big winners. Rates for 
daytime toll calls, made mostly by businesses, will fall an average of 44% 
under the commission's ruling -- and they could fall even more depending on how 
aggressively the nearly 100 long-distance carriers compete for a piece of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But small businesses that make few local long-distance calls will end up 
paying substantially more under the new plan. GTE's monthly basic business rate 
is going up 83% to $19.22. Pacific Bell's monthly basic business rate is rising 
24% to $10.32. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-distance industry is furious that the new policy does not require 
Pacific Bell and GTE to provide so-called 1-plus dialing for toll calls.  
</P>
<P>
 Although a customer who uses, for example, MCI for regular long-distance 
service only needs to dial a 1, the area code and number, the same customer 
using MCI for local long distance will have to dial a five-digit access code 
first. They will also have to know the toll call boundaries in order to know 
when to use the codes. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI denounced the access code requirement as a "Rube Goldberg-like process" 
and a "Pacific Bell ruse" that would thwart the development of true 
competition. The commission, noting that it is not technically possible to 
implement 1-plus dialing by Jan. 1, sided with Pacific Bell and GTE, which 
argued that such a requirement would be unduly expensive to implement and thus 
would force more local rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI and AT & T urged the commission Thursday to speed up hearings on ordering 
the local carriers to install the technology making equal access calling 
possible.

O.C. CONGRESSMEN NOT MOVED BY CLINTON'S HAITI SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether President Clinton's emotional speech Thursday 
night convinced the American people that an invasion of Haiti is justified, but 
it was immediately clear that Orange County's conservative delegation would not 
be swayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still looks like a small man in a big office and an illegitimate 
President," said Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), moments after watching 
Clinton make his case for an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 So convinced are Orange County congressmen that Clinton's Haiti strategy is 
wrong-headed that several who were asked to respond to the televised address 
had their remarks prepared hours before the cameras even rolled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is going to mobilize and send over 20,000 U.S. troops to Haiti 
. . . spill American and Haitian blood, spending over a billion dollars of 
taxpayers' money in the process, just to install and, in effect, bodyguard an 
anti-American leader of questionable stability," Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) 
said in a statement prepared early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton contends that an invasion is the only way to dislodge the military 
junta that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sept. 30, 1991 -- just 
months after he became the first democratically elected leader in Haiti's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Military dictators have since imposed "a reign of terror," the President said, 
citing the execution of children, the rape of women and human rights atrocities 
that have sent waves of desperate Haitians fleeing to the United States for 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan called the atrocities outlined by Clinton "total and absolute 
propaganda." And Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) said that even if 
true, they were hardly just cause for military action. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are atrocities going on all over the world," Rohrabacher said after 
hearing Clinton's remarks. "If human rights abuses were legitimate grounds for 
invading another country, we would be invading half the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom has a cry for freedom and democracy gone unembraced by Orange County 
conservatives. But not this time. Although Aristide was Haiti's first 
democratically elected leader, the congressmen said he proved himself a brutal 
thug and an anti-American who once likened the United States to Satan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ordered 'necklacing' for the guy who finished second in the democratic 
election," charged Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), referring to the act 
of burning one's political rivals to death with a gasoline-filled tire placed 
around the neck. "It's very difficult to call that democratic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing indications that the regime might step aside for new elections, Cox 
said a wiser course would be to lift the embargo in exchange for "scheduling 
elections forthwith." 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti, the congressmen agreed, is "not worth one drop of American blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) quoted a letter from a constituent with a son 
in the armed forces: "Show me one piece of rationale that I can lay at my son's 
grave or carve on his tombstone. Then and only then will I sleep at night with 
the comfort that a supreme sacrifice could be justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rohrabacher does not believe the President succeeded in convincing 
Americans or Congress that an invasion is right, he said Haitian dictators 
should heed Clinton's message that their time is up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have got to know that when a President of the United States goes on 
nationwide television and talks tough, he can't weasel out of it," he said.

PEROT SAYS HAITI POLICY 'MAKES NO SENSE'; FOREIGN POLICY: ON EVE OF O.C. RALLY, 
FORMER RIVAL TAKES SHOTS AT CLINTON FOR THREATENING INVASION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former presidential candidate Ross Perot on Thursday described the threatened 
U.S. invasion of Haiti as a policy that "makes no sense" and accused President 
Clinton of concocting plans for the proposed military action in an attempt to 
win votes from black members of Congress for the recently passed crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Clinton a "guy (who) doesn't understand warfare," Perot also said the 
Administration was inclined to invade Haiti because "little wars historically 
give a President a bump" in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have a commander in chief who would not risk his own life in combat 
as a young man," Perot told reporters in a conference call from his Dallas 
headquarters before Clinton's televised speech on Haiti. "Now he's feeling a 
sudden urge to risk other people's lives in combat without getting the approval 
of Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also boasted about the role his United We Stand supporters have played 
as swing voters in recent elections and ticked off a number of races where they 
made a difference, including the New Jersey governor's campaign and the Texas 
Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Texas billionaire, who captured 19% of the nationwide vote in the 1992 
presidential election and 24% in Orange County, insisted he had no interest in 
another run for the presidency or in starting a new political party. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said his goal is to see talented Republican and Democratic 
candidates run for office so that "our members can sit back and grin and say, 
'Heads, we win; tails we win.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Perot is scheduled to appear tonight and Saturday at rallies in Orange County 
and the San Francisco Bay area, part of a 10-city national tour aimed at 
recharging his backers for the coming elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The plain-spoken Texan offered no evidence to support his assertion that 
Clinton had signaled a willingness to invade Haiti in order to win support for 
the crime bill from African-American members of Congress, whom he did not 
identify. Perot, who has made the claim several times in recent days, said the 
Administration so far has failed to answer his questions about whether rumors 
of such a deal are true, but he said Clinton "has a habit of buying votes." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Perot contended, health care is simply not the major problem it 
has been made out to be in Washington circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of health care is not in trouble," he said. "It has some parts that need 
to be fixed." He urged Congress to form a bipartisan commission to identify the 
problem areas, bring in experts to develop plans to fix them, then test them 
with pilot programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, he said, "you find out what your real costs are." But he complained 
that if you bring up such ideas in Washington, "they act like you're 
extraterrestrial." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also sounded familiar themes from his 1992 campaign, including the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, which he fought bitterly against. And he made it 
clear that he still expects to be vindicated on the issue, despite government 
figures indicating the pact has been a boon to the United States as well as its 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the agreement took effect Jan. 1, he said, the United States has lost 
one factory each day to Mexico. Jobs are also leaving the country for Canada, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also touched briefly on the issue of illegal immigration, although he 
said United We Stand officials in California had made their own decision about 
whether to play a role in the current Proposition 187 campaign to deny 
education and certain health care benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 United We Stand officials in Orange County, as well as the organizers of the 
Proposition 187 campaign, credit the Perot organization with gathering nearly 
half of the 600,000 signatures that were submitted to qualify the measure for 
the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot made it clear that he understood -- and to some extent, at least, 
sympathized with -- the goals of the controversial initiative. "We can't create 
incentives to come across the border, " he said. "It would be nice to welcome 
everybody, but we just can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot is scheduled to appear at 8 p.m. tonight at the Sequoia Conference 
Center, 7530 Orangethorpe Ave. in Buena Park.

PAMPHLET TO EXPLAIN LAST-MINUTE PROPOSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting at the last minute of the 1994 session, the Legislature added three 
more propositions to the Nov. 8 ballot, for a total of 10 statewide measures to 
face California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposals were enacted Aug. 31, the final day of the session, but 
too late to be included in the regular voter pamphlet. As a result, a 
supplemental pamphlet will be printed and mailed Sept. 29 at the same time as 
the regular booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest measures, each a proposed constitutional amendment, include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 189, by Assemblyman Cruz Bustamante (D-Fresno), which would 
expand no-bail restrictions to felony sexual assault defendants who, in the 
opinion of the judge, would be likely to injure others if they were freed on 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 190, by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), which 
would overhaul the state Commission on Judicial Performance with the intent of 
making it less secretive and more aggressive in taking disciplinary actions 
against judges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 191, by Sen. Ralph Dills (D-El Segundo), which would abolish 
justice courts, found mostly in rural areas, and rename them municipal courts. 
Salaries and qualifications of current justice court judges would remain the 
same unless changed by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days before the end of this year's session, the Legislature also took 
the rare step of removing a previously qualified proposal from the ballot, 
Proposition 182. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Speaker Brown and real estate interests, Proposition 182 was a 
$185-million bond issue to finance mortgage loans to first-time home buyers. A 
virtually identical measure was defeated by voters in the Nov. 2, 1993, 
statewide special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the voters' wholesale rejection of bond issues in June, the Legislature 
and Gov. Pete Wilson agreed to strike Proposition 182 from the upcoming general 
election rather than risk its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other ballot measures will be decided Nov. 8, ranging from a $1-billion 
bond issue for expansion of rail transit systems to the "three strikes" 
initiative for violent and serious felons to denial of public education and 
non-emergency medical benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Printing costs for both sets of ballot pamphlets are estimated at $3.6 million 
and postage will total more than $2 million.

UNDERCOVER ANGELS; BOOKS: A CELEBRATED CASE THAT VIRTUALLY CLEARED ORANGE 
COUNTY OF NOTORIOUS BIKERS IN THE '70S IS THE SUBJECT OF THE NEW 'CHAIN OF 
EVIDENCE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's 1970, white eye shadow is still in, and you've just graduated from the 
Orange County Sheriff's Department academy, first in your class. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward to 1976. After a rapid rise through the ranks, its time to 
transfer to an undercover drug detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet your new partner, one Wayne Carlander. He's a sunflower-seed-chomping, 
clever veteran who's talked robbers into surrendering and turning over the 
loot, all without moving his 300-pound, 6-feet-6 body from his desk. Oh, did we 
mention that he's a chauvinist? 
</P>
<P>
 Your first assignment: Pose as a biker girlfriend of a real convicted robber 
and infiltrate the Hells Angels. This means riding around all day on the back 
of a Harley-Davidson, even though you are petrified of motorcycles, hanging out 
in scudsy biker dens with guys named Bruno and Bugger Butch, buying drugs and 
hoping nobody recognizes you for the cool blond detective that you are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Victoria Seele says, laughing now, 18 years later, a happily married, 
out-of-state suburban mom and businesswoman who hasn't packed a gun in a 
decade. "I was pretty young and naive and adventurous to do all that, wasn't 
I?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clinging to the waist of an undercover informant, Carlander trailing them in a 
surveillance vehicle, the trio pulled off the biggest undercover operation of 
the time against outlaw bikers. And the Hells Angels haven't been back to these 
parts since. 
</P>
<P>
 So says "Chain of Evidence," (Dutton, $21.95) a book out this month by a 
first-time author who calls himself Michael Detroit, "because the Hells Angels 
might not like some of what I wrote about them." He tells the 18-year-old story 
of how Seele posed as the rich girlfriend of undercover informant Cliff Mowery, 
a prisoner released early to help infiltrate the fledgling Hells Angels chapter 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlander, the low-key mastermind of the case, convinced Sheriff Brad Gates 
that a violent convict sprung from prison could be trusted and the trio could 
kick some biker butt. 
</P>
<P>
 When the end came eight months later, 125 officers from Orange, Los Angeles 
and San Bernardino counties simultaneously moved in and arrested 77 suspects, 
most of them bikers, 19 of them Hells Angels. They included the secretary and 
sergeant-at-arms of the L.A. chapter. Besides getting them off the streets, 
prime booty included a cache of club financial records and membership lists of 
every Angel in the U.S. and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 There were so many defendants during seven months of trials that judges 
throughout Orange County volunteered to increase their caseloads, even 
scheduled lower-court and civil cases at night, so the numerous biker cases 
could be tried promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the 77 defendants was convicted and sentenced to prison.

 "Police penetration of the gang," says the book's prologue, "was accomplished 
by three extraordinary people who paid prices too high. One would die, one 
would flee the state under a different name, and the other would become a 
reluctant hero." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Look for the ex-partners soon on national daytime shows, with their first 
appearance scheduled Monday on ABC's "Good Morning America." Seele (a 
pseudonym) will alter her looks and intends to wing it with the likes of Joan 
Lunden, she said during a two-hour phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite wanted posters the book says Hells Angels circulated promising a 
$25,000 reward for their murders, Seele is no longer skittish about 
retribution. Carlander never did worry much about that and remains a sergeant 
with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-effacing investigator, Carlander doesn't expect to get much attention 
and figures the TV types will be more interested in the juicy details from 
Seele. She is, after all, the one who entrusted her life to a criminal and 
partied with the Angels for eight long months, her performance so convincing 
that besides fooling the bikers, a captain told reporters that police were 
stopping the undercover officer and informant daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say I'm afraid; I would say I'm cautious," Seele said. "At the 
time, I would say I was paranoid and neurotic, but I view the (television) 
appearances as calculated risk." "I'm certainly not doing this for the money," 
she added. "It's certainly not worth compromising yourself in even this small 
way for the money. But this whole (publicity) thing is to give some insight 
into the book and have some fun. After all, this is entertaining. It's a kick! 
How many people can say that they've done something that turned into a book?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Penetrating biker clubs is audacious and risky. That Seele lasted undetected 
for eight months is impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very tough to infiltrate," said Special Agent Ray Lochridge, who in 
the 1970s worked undercover some with bikers himself and now is the Drug 
Enforcement Administration's Los Angeles spokesman. "You've got to do some 
illegal activities to be initiated as a member, so it really eliminated the 
infiltration by special agents and informants. And it's pretty risky to be 
found working as an informant for the Hells Angels. You could get tortured, 
mutilated, killed. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a remarkable story. I would say a lot has to do with the individual 
who brought her in. To come in cold is unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Mowery. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carlander first approached Mowery at the Orange County Jail, Mowery 
looked as tough as his rap sheet indicated. A muscular 6-feet-4 with 32 tattoos 
(Hells Angels wings and a hangman's noose dominated his chest), he was on 
parole for armed robbery when the CHP stopped him and found him with a gun. 
Facing return to Soledad state prison, he agreed to Carlander's plot to 
infiltrate the Hells Angels locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Glore, Hells Angels sergeant-at-arms of the L.A. club, was a target from 
the start, an alleged producer of high-quality methamphetamine that was finding 
its way onto Southern California streets. Mowery would be key to unlocking the 
club door. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight months, Mowery was kept in a motel -- now called the Key Inn -- 
visible from the Santa Ana Freeway in Tustin. Most nights Carlander and other 
sheriff's detectives would eyeball his room from a parked car, making sure he 
did not venture out into trouble. If charm were a felony, Mowery would be doing 
life without parole. That and his good looks made him a magnet for women, and 
at one point he seduced another undercover detective who was fired when she was 
caught sneaking out of Mowery's room. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no similar effect on Seele, who saw his drunken meanness and capacity 
for violence; besides, she was happily married to an electrical contractor who 
was supportive and patient while his wife grew edgier month by month. Holding 
it all together was Carlander. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe him my life," Seele says earnestly. "For a combination of everything 
from start to finish. I would never have involved myself if it wasn't for the 
fact that Wayne was my partner. We had an incredible situation that took an 
incredible handling, and I don't think Cliff (Mowery) could have been handled 
by anyone else. Wayne has this incredible skill with people. He can sit down 
and talk to people and I don't care who it is, but especially convicts, felons. 
He knew how to deal with them, give them the degree of respect that's important 
to them, and he has perfect timing. He knew when to back off, when to apply 
pressure, when to call their bluff." 
</P>
<P>
 One night, Mowery was acting up and challenged Carlander, whose solution was 
immediate and served to take control while not antagonizing an angry sociopath. 
He suggested a contest to see who could hit a power pole with a rock. And he 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Wayne," Seele said, laughing. "He handled that so quick. I would have 
pulled out my gun and shot (Mowery)." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Mowery gotten into serious trouble, the undercover operation would have 
been finished. It was that simple. He required constant managing and finesse. 
Besides the deputy's tete-a-tete, the case was almost ruined again when Mowery 
got drunk and started a donnybrook with a Santa Ana officer called to a 
doughnut shop where Mowery was causing trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlander persuaded the officer -- whom Mowery had beat up -- to drop charges 
against the undercover informant. 
</P>
<P>
 As the undercover pair ingratiated themselves with bikers, the book says: 
"They made buys in various parts of the county on a daily basis. They would do 
a deal for a gram of meth in Fullerton, ride the chopper to Stanton for three 
balloons of heroin, go to Garden Grove for two grams of cocaine, then take 
another ride to San Bernardino for more meth and a conversation about guns. Or 
stolen cars. Or hot electronics and where to sell them. And Carlander, often 
with (Detective) Bud Nease, would follow behind them. In addition to roaring 
from one drug-infested neighborhood to the next, Victoria and Mowery would 
attend parties at bikers' houses or simply hang out in their favorite bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Seele did not initially fit in, but nobody questioned her presence. Even with 
her stunning athletic physique and long platinum hair, she always wrapped her 
head in a bandanna. With her intimidating sidekick and their revving chopper, 
mothers often shielded their small children from the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mowery was already "included as a regular, although he was not officially a 
member of any club," the book says. "It had become common knowledge that the 
Angels liked what they saw in Mowery," and the Angels state vice-president told 
him he would sponsor Mowery. 
</P>
<P>
 Seele's cover story was that she was Mowery's girlfriend, a rich divorcing 
woman who was selling drugs to her housewife girlfriends until her property 
settlement. The alibi also helped her retain her innate gentility, although she 
had to defer to Mowery in the presence of the men and women with whom she sat 
around bars and downtrodden trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of the undercover team, Mowery came to Seele's rescue a couple 
of times and made it clear to other bikers that, unlike many of them, he would 
not be sharing his woman with the club. It did not hurt that Mowery's 6-feet-4 
body was scarred from past battles. Carlander once watched him at a motorcycle 
swap meet in L.A. take on all attacking bikers with a chopper kickstand -- 
while a knife was dangling out of his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the generally bad treatment most biker women receive, Seele managed to 
actually enjoy a big bar party one night in which she won the wet T-shirt 
contest after various Hells Angels soaked her top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was young; I was naive, what can I say? I would never do it again today," 
Seele says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover team knew that one day it would end, as many such operations 
do, when they suspected someone was on to them. It happened to Seele one night 
while she and Mowery were buying drugs in a couple's home. The woman had been 
in jail while Seele was working there. Seele was sure she had been recognized; 
the operation was over that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Seele slept for long periods and did not leave her house. Days later the sweep 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 14, 1977, then-deputy district attorney Ron Kreber (now a judge) 
presented his evidence before an Orange County grand jury, which returned 57 
indictments for 77 alleged felons. All but one of the Hells Angels made bail, 
and he was extradited to Connecticut on a fugitive warrant for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Angel they captured was Michael Lee (Bruno) Mason, owner of a 
Santa Ana motorcycle shop in which the undercover officer bought drugs. The 
secretary-treasurer of the L.A. chapter, he was said to lead the budding Orange 
County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The day original target Glore got out on bail, his body was found with 12 
bullets in it in the home where he had kept files of every Hells Angel member 
in the U.S. and Europe. From his home, officers had also taken extensive 
records relating to Hells Angels that, the book says, were "a huge windfall of 
otherwise impossible-to-get information about the inside operations of a secret 
criminal enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 An Angels hit-man was allegedly brought out from New York to take out the cops 
and Mowery, who was hidden in a series of motel rooms until after he bravely 
stared down courtrooms packed with bikers and testified against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Seele never did testify, and the media helped protect her identity by never 
using her or Carlander's real names or photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carlander minimizes his role in the case and is circumspect about his private 
life, which is less elaborated upon than Seele's in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and I, we'd go around on some things, but she did a dynamite, dynamite 
job," Carlander said with obvious fondness for a friend of 18 years. "She was a 
great partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago, Carlander transferred to a lower-profile job, waiting out his 
retirement as sergeant of inmate transportation. The father of two girls and a 
boy, Carlander is looking forward in 360 working days to a life of golf, 
betting the ponies and playing with his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, he says, will in some small way give them a legacy and something for 
which they can be proud of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't ask for more than that," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 After two months off to recuperate and consider her future, Seele realized she 
had an even more promising future with the sheriff's department. She had spent 
only 10 months working in the women's jail -- where female employees were then 
stuck -- before assignment to a special burglary team, and she clearly proved 
her skills in the biker case. Sheriff Gates told the "Chain of Evidence" author 
that, had she stayed with the department, she'd be running it today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seele had no interest in being at a desk, being a boss. She felt she had 
already cheated fate on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'let's not push the odds.' I made it through this. I learned that 
I had some abilities under pressure that I no way knew I was capable of. I had 
received a tremendous gift and opportunity from the department, but I couldn't 
really use it at the department." 
</P>
<P>
 So Seele quit and changed her name, moving with her husband to another state. 
Just as she launched her own business, which involves "risk management and 
consulting," she discovered she was pregnant. She would have three children, 
the oldest now 12. After a seven-year break, she has returned to her business, 
now that all of her children are in school. 
</P>
<P>
 For months after the busts, she kept her .38 revolver on the shower ledge. 
Once she almost drew down on her husband, who came home from work early one 
afternoon while she was bathing. She has guns locked away now. 
</P>
<P>
 Her kids know Mom was a cop, but they'll have to wait a while to watch her 
videotaped TV appearances or to read "Chain of Evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be reading the book for at least a couple more years," she says. 
"Oh, Lord, no. But I'll save an autographed book for them. Autographed, 'From 
Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Mowery left California, too, bound for a job in the Oklahoma oil fields. 
But upon his return to California a while later, he "died in a mysterious 
motorcycle accident," the book publicist said in a dramatic whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 The book ends with Mowery's death in an apparent freeway motorcycle crash, but 
the implication is clear: It might have been a retribution killing for his work 
as an informant. But there is no proof of that.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; GANGING UP ON VIOLENCE; GREEN RIBBON CAMPAIGN 
GREW FROM ANGER, GRIEF OVER SHOOTING OF TEEN-AGER AFTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASMINE SHOUKRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Jasmine Shoukry, a June graduate of 
Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, is attending Boston University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John is being pressured into joining a gang. A friend brings him to Karen 
Lott's house and he becomes one in a group of teen-agers who gather every 
Sunday evening in her living room, headquarters for the Green Ribbon campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 John is one of the borderline teens who have joined the gatherings at Lott's 
Lake Forest home. 
</P>
<P>
 They discuss their fears or experiences with youth violence, make posters for 
rallies, write letters to politicians, talk about their personal achievements 
and feel the comfort of working together on a cause that Lott believes needs 
more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott founded the Green Ribbon campaign to focus on teen violence after her 
18-year-old son, Philip, was shot four times while walking home from El Toro 
High School on Nov. 4, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Four teens were subsequently tried for attempted murder; all were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the organization that was started on Philip's behalf has blossomed 
to include more than 5,000 teens in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado 
and Massachusetts. There are members in Australia and England as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Ribbon idea came to Lott when she was looking for a way to deal with 
the confusion and despair over the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed with (Philip) for four days (in the hospital) and when I came home I 
saw his room was exactly how I left it, and I sat on his bed and I was so full 
of sadness, I cried myself to sleep," she recalled. "I prayed to Lord, 'What 
can I do?' and I dreamed of the green ribbon." 
</P>
<P>
 So she started writing "Stop youth violence, support Philip" on little pieces 
of paper and attached green ribbons to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started, my immediate goal was to increase public awareness about teen 
violence," Lott said. "I wanted to bring parents, educators and law enforcement 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 The day after her dream, she took the messages and ribbons to the hospital to 
show Philip and his friend Corrine Hatter. Hatter, a June graduate of El Toro 
High in Lake Forest, and Philip became the co-chairs, and the campaign was 
rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 The green ribbons symbolize hope and growth, said Philip, who is now almost 
fully recovered from the bullet wounds to his stomach and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mom) wants kids to have the chance to grow up without having to worry about 
getting shot or hurt," said Philip, a senior at El Toro High School. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the effort, high school students in Orange County as well as 
Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Francisco and San Diego counties have 
organized Green Ribbon rallies and marches and have attended city council 
meetings to speak about youth violence, hoping to influence legislation 
pertaining to youth violence. The organization also sponsored its first essay 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott plans to establish a fund to help teen victims of violence pay for some 
of the extras in high school, like class rings, yearbooks and proms.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are financial burdens that come with caring for a victim," she said, 
explaining the need for such a fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lotts have taken their green ribbon message to high schools, national talk 
shows and a law enforcement conference for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this year, Lott hopes to have a Green Ribbon campaign in every 
Orange County high school, including buttons that say, "I will not be part of 
the problem, I will be part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach High School has become particularly involved in the Green 
Ribbon campaign, according to Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (campaign) is part of our total emphasis on student safety, respect for 
each other, and (it's) a message of nonviolence," said Huntington Beach High 
principal Jim Stauntan.  
</P>
<P>
 However, instead of just passing out ribbons to everyone, students were told 
if they wished to wear a green ribbon, they could pick one up at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did this because if (students) come get it, it means something to them," 
Stauntan said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the school took it one step further by making every Tuesday a green ribbon 
day for administrators.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a small thing to do (but) it has such a big impact," Stauntan 
said. "I'm really pleased with those kids who choose to wear them. They put 
them on their backpacks, I see them in their hair, on their shoes. It makes 
people aware. It reminds them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter, who wrote to President Clinton about the Green Ribbon campaign and 
received a personal reply, has used the organization as a means of channeling 
her anger about Philip's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This) was the only thing I did for a while. I'd be up until 3 in the morning 
cutting green ribbons," said Hatter, who has been friends with Philip since the 
ninth grade. "Everything made me really angry and this was my was of fighting 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Lott quit her job as a real estate agent to work full time on the Green Ribbon 
campaign. "This is my way of healing," she explained. "In the beginning, I was 
just fighting for Philip. But now I want to help thousands of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 She conveys that desire in her Sunday evening gatherings with high school 
students. Many of the teens who attend the meetings are like Philip, she said, 
and are not involved with gangs. However, lately some teens who are thinking 
about joining gangs have started coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come over, and we tell them about what happens if you join a gang," Lott 
said. "We tell them they're so special that there is more to life than being a 
bad guy."

INSIDE LINE: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; AN EYE ON THE BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball and football are the leading causes of sports-related eye injuries 
in the 15- to 24-year-old age group. 
</P>
<P>
 Elbow injuries to the eye are not uncommon in basketball, nor are deep 
abrasions (from fingernails) to the cornea, the eye's clear, outer layer, says 
says Arlene Drack, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Emory University 
School of Medicine in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Corneal cuts may also occur during mountain biking or cross-country running, 
when tree branches slash the eyeball. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightweight, shatterproof, polycarbonate safety glasses, goggles or shields 
should be worn when participating in high-risk sports, including baseball, 
basketball and football, Drack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Racquetball, paddle ball, tennis and other racquet sports also put the eyes at 
risk for retinal detachment, a serious threat to eyesight in which the retina, 
the camera film-like structure on the back wall of the eye, is damaged. 
Extended Friendship 
</P>
<P>
 Two juniors from Laguna Hills High School, who have been friends since the 
fifth grade, will be gone for a year to participate in different countries as 
American Field Service foreign exchange students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Weinberg is in Santiago del Estero, Argentina, where he will attend a 
Catholic school and live with a family of eight until July. He became 
interested in AFS when his family hosted a student from Denmark two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ross got his friend, Camrin Christensen interested in AFS, and she was 
off last month to the Czech Republic, where she will live with a family of five 
and attend a Secondary School of Nursing in Kolin, about 45 miles from Prague. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends plan to keep in touch during the year and compare notes on their 
return next summer.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; SKIING AND SNOWBOARDING 
TOMMY MOE'S WINTER EXTREME; FOR SUPER NINTENDO BY ELECTRO BRAIN, $62.95  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM SCHIFFMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can experience snowy thrills from the comfort of your home, courtesy of 
Electro Brain. Take a run down the slopes with Skiing and Snowboarding Tommy 
Moe's Winter Extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the unwieldy title, this is an interesting and unusual game. It 
covers two areas that rarely (if ever) show up on video game shelves -- 
downhill skiing and snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
 And it does it in a very realistic, graphically exciting and entertaining way. 
</P>
<P>
 In this one- or two-player cart, pick skis or snowboard and select training 
mode to practice the runs. The runs are against a clock; in training you're 
racing against the best time for that run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freeride mode pits you in competition against the clock. You start out 
with a set amount of time and must reach certain checkpoints before that time 
expires. If you do, additional time is added and you head for the next 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 If you fail, you have to walk back to the top and start over. No chairlift for 
you, loser. 
</P>
<P>
 In the compete mode, you can race in the slalom, giant slalom or downhill. In 
each, you can choose either snowboard or skis to try the four "challenges." 
Each challenge consists of three races. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first race of each challenge, you have to finish in the top seven to 
move on; in the second race, the top five; in the third, the top three. You do 
receive a password after each challenge, so you don't have to do the entire 
competition over again. 
</P>
<P>
 The track is littered with moguls, trees, rocks and chunks of rock, not to 
mention the gates in the slalom competition. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, it's as hard as it sounds. You set the speed with the B button on 
your controller, and you can go as slowly as you want to avoid becoming one 
with a tree or rock. But speed is the name of the game, and if you cruise, you 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game first arrived, I was dubious. I'm often that way, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tommy Moe won me over. It's fast, it's fun and it's really unusual. There 
are plenty of ninjas, space aliens and superheroes around, but there's only one 
Skiing and Snowboarding Tommy Moe's Winter Extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 With a title like that, it may be a good thing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tetris is perhaps the most acclaimed -- and maybe the most popular -- puzzle 
game in history. It hit the gaming world like a bomb, sold zillions of copies 
and variations have poured from the minds of programmers ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's a new one, with a hallowed name -- Tetris 2. 
</P>
<P>
 T2 (not to be confused with the movie blockbuster, please) is a Nintendo 
production ($49.95 for SNES) and it's even more entertaining than the original. 
</P>
<P>
 T2 offers two modes. The first is similar to T1, requiring the player -- 
that's you -- to rearrange falling blocks so three or more blocks of the same 
color line up and are blipped off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the original, there are three types of blocks on screen -- flash 
blocks, fixed blocks and falling blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fixed blocks are on the screen when the game begins and you have to get 
rid of them to clear the round. The flashing blocks have a special value -- get 
rid of them and all the blocks of that color are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not explaining the falling blocks. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 The puzzle mode works about the same way, but gives you only a set amount of 
falling blocks to work your magic. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite was playing a two-player game against the computer, racing to 
clear the screen before the guy in the box does. 
</P>
<P>
 If you liked Tetris, you have to get Tetris 2. It may be twice as much fun.

THEY STILL MAKE FINE GEMS; THE MIGHTY DIAMONDS KEEP ON JAMMIN' WITH NEW, 
RELEVANT REGGAE SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You wouldn't know it from from reading Rolling Stone, but there's a notable 
25th anniversary in rock music this year that has nothing to do with old 
hippies or mud-cakedteen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating on a considerably smaller scale than Woodstock '94, veteran Jamaican 
reggae band the Mighty Diamonds is boarding the tour bus this week, a 
quarter-century after it first started spreading its soulful, rootsy sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that this anniversary has generated little fanfare is typical of the 
Diamonds' career. According to band member Lloyd (Judge) Ferguson, its business 
affairs have left the group disappointed and, at times, angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating that we have not gotten the recognition we should have," 
said the 45-year-old Ferguson during a recent phone interview from Kingston, 
Jamaica. Reggae music critic Randall Grass agrees, writing in the New Rolling 
Stone Record Guide: "Since their 1977 classic 'Right Time,' they have not 
enjoyed the international recognition they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ferguson: "Some of it might be our own fault, but I truly believe our 
past revolving door of management has been our downfall. When we were making 
hit tunes we had people making decisions who didn't know the business."  
</P>
<P>
 "The promotion and marketing just wasn't there," he added. "But now Marc 
(Marc-Antoine Chetata, their current manager) is really trying hard to 
straighten things out so we can enjoy the fruits of our labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such past problems, the group -- whose RAS Posse Tour '94 plays the 
Coach House tonight -- carries on making new, relevant reggae. In fact, the 
band has been busier than ever, having released both "Paint It Red" in the 
United States and "Moment of Truth" in Europe last year, while its new "Speak 
The Truth" album is slated to hit stores next week. Known for their mix of 
sweet, soulful harmonies and harder-edged, socially con scious material, the 
trio -- Ferguson, lead singer Donald (Tabby) Shaw and vocalist Fitzroy (Bunny) 
Simpson -- grew up listening to a variety of reggae, soul and R&B. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their favorite performers ranged from the Stylistics and Impressions to Donna 
Summer and Deniece Williams to Peter Tosh and Toots & the Maytals, wide-ranging 
influences that lend flavor and depth to the Diamonds' musical personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, they scored international hits with the singles "Jailhouse," 
"Have Mercy," "Why, Me Black Brother, Why" and "Them Never Love Poor Marcus."  
</P>
<P>
 These days, Ferguson said, "we still sing about the realities of life, the 
experiences of youth. . . . We sing the truth as we see it. The new songs are 
all originals . . . spiritually inspired . . . based on our culture and 
experiences. We encourage people to read the Scriptures, and keep your head 
about you during tough times." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview, Simpson said that with the new album, "we wanted to 
create some of today's more modern sounds, without losing the feel and emotion 
behind them. We were getting too far away from the basics of music: melody, 
rhythm and the beat." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How has the threesome managed to stay together for so many years with so 
little financial reward? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like brothers; we stick together no matter what," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is our life," Ferguson added. "We're looking ahead to producing some 
other young musicians that Bunny's been working with. Nobody's seeking unknown 
talent and promoting original music, so that's what we're going to get into 
soon."  
</P>
<P>
 "But we still love to play and perform . . . sharing with our audience, and 
feeling the participation of men and women -- young and old, black and white -- 
all singing and dancing together at our concerts. Isn't that what it's really 
all about?" 
</P>
<P>

the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano. 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. $19.50. (714)

TERMS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT; BOOKS, FILMS, STAGE FILL MACLAINE'S DAYS (DON'T ASK 
ABOUT METAPHYSICS) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Shirley MacLaine has been razzed for her metaphysical beliefs often 
enough and drawn enough cutting reviews to explain her prickly, often openly 
disdainful attitude during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave one-word answers to some questions and banned certain topics, namely 
metaphysics. Whenever the phone rang, MacLaine answered, even though an 
assistant and her manager were on hand. One conversation dragged on for 15 
minutes without so much as a "pardon me." 
</P>
<P>
 While she refuses anymore to discuss the other-dimensional fascination she 
revealed more than a decade ago in her bestseller, "Out on a Limb," she did say 
she hasn't minded most of the ribbing -- only the bad jokes and the fact that 
"interviews always veer off to that" subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The jokes, at least, come less frequently nowadays. MacLaine thinks it is 
partly because her attitude toward spiritual exploration has become so 
"mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, she brightened considerably when addressing subjects that do 
interest her. Like the one-woman show she's performing tonight through Sunday 
-- to open the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts' third season. 
</P>
<P>
 She also seemed genuinely enthusiastic about discussing her writing. Each of 
her seven books has been a bestseller. Her eighth (she won't divulge the 
subject) is due this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The world-traveled actress, dancer, singer and author recalled some colorful 
anecdotes from a still-active, distinguished 40-year, 40-plus-film career. 
During that time, she has amassed five Emmy awards, six Oscar nominations -- 
winning the best actress award for "Terms of Endearment" in 1983 -- and legions 
of fans. 
</P>
<P>
 And theatrical magic happened when, for an instant during the interview, she 
assumed the character of Aurora Greenway, whom she played in "Terms of 
Endearment" and will reprise in "Evening Star." She expects to start filming 
the sequel this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaine, 60, wore a long, loose-fitting natural-fiber brown shift for the 
interview in her beachfront apartment, one of six in a building she owns. Her 
reddish-brown hair, cut in that trademark pixie, softly framed her clear green 
eyes, ringed by those starry black lashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her living room, just a few feet from the surf, is decorated with Japanese 
prints, photographs of the actress with brother Warren Beatty, Liza Minnelli 
and other stars, and one that pictures what appears to be an Eastern guru sort. 
</P>
<P>
 She was happiest to talk about her singing, dancing revue, which she called 
"completely new." It contains Mama Rose songs from "Gypsy" and other material 
from the show she performed at Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre in 1991, her most 
recent Orange County appearance. "I love 'Gypsy,' " she said, sipping iced tea, 
"but I never wanted to go to Broadway and commit to a run of the play, so I do 
a kind of mini-Gypsy musical. Then I do a whole, long medley about a woman's 
ups-and-downs in her relationship with love, almost 70 songs. . . . A show like 
this evolves, you take out whole hunks and put in new whole hunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Age hasn't made it much more difficult to perform the 90-minute show, she 
said, providing she eats properly ("sugar, that's my downfall") and maintains 
an exercise program to keep her body "aligned." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just finished playing in Canada," she said, "and I played a couple dates at 
Disney World in Florida. And I had the urge to go to Argentina, so I played it 
down there (in May), and in Brazil. It's great to have a show like this because 
you can travel and do what you love to do at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 The fun comes from getting to know her audiences, she said. In South America, 
for instance, after mixing with folks at local eateries and reading the papers, 
she spoke on stage "about what was going on in Sao Paulo, or in Rio or 
wherever." 
</P>
<P>
 "They love the familiarity that you might have with what their lives are, and 
I love to be a part of what's happening when I'm there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegian government loved her in a big way when years ago she helped them 
save face. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaine was about to appear in Norway at a $100-per-seat grand opening for a 
new, government-funded theater when its director approached her shortly before 
curtain. An electrical storm, he told her, combined with some unresolved 
technical bugs, could mean trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 He "came to me and my people," she recalled, "and said, 'Look, with the storm 
outside, there's no (electrical) ground in this theater, so we can guarantee 
against loss of equipment, but we can't guarantee against loss of life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The actress still gets a great laugh out of that line, reiterating it with a 
hearty laugh. She decided to go on, she said, which ultimately resulted in her 
decision to hire a new vocal coach. For safety's sake, she performed the "whole 
show without a microphone." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaine, who had never "even hardly written a letter" before publishing her 
first book, started to write mostly because of her extensive travels, some of 
which she describes in her books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided I wanted to share a lot of the things I experienced, I guess . 
. . and I loved it, I love the feeling. I'm in better health when I write. 
There's nothing like having your thoughts well ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider myself a really good writer. I just am a clear thinker and I 
put the thoughts down with one word, simple. It's not an extensive vocabulary, 
but it's clear." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Richmond, Va., MacLaine studied ballet as a girl. Shortly after high 
school, she got work in New York as a chorus girl and was picked to understudy 
Carol Haney, the lead in "The Pajama Game" on Broadway. One night in 1954 she 
went on for the injured star, got raves and a plane ticket west. Producer Hal 
Wallis had seen the show and offered her a movie contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since her first film, "The Trouble With Harry" (1955), she has played diverse 
characters ranging from a helpless waif in "The Apartment" (1960) to a smarmy 
hooker in "Irma La Douce" (1963). Her more recent movies include "Steel 
Magnolias" (1989), "Postcards From the Edge" (1990) and "Guarding Tess," which 
came out last March. 
</P>
<P>
 She often rejects inferior scripts, she said, and is "amazed" at what does get 
produced. "So," she added wryly, "is the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 She has no qualms, however, about revisiting Aurora Greenway. In "Evening 
Star," the willful, overbearing matriarch, now 20 years older, realizes that 
she has not done a good job raising the grown children of her deceased 
daughter, played in "Terms of Endearment" by Debra Winger. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora's grandchildren "are an unmitigated disaster, every one of them," said 
MacLaine, effortlessly taking on Greenway's perturbed air and clipped speech. 
"And she doesn't understand why. Why can't children just enjoy their lives and 
not be so upset with things, and why do they take dope and why is he in prison 
and why did she get knocked up by this person ." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway goes to a psychiatrist to get some help, but ends up seducing the 
good doctor, 30 years her junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the therapy isn't going to work very well," MacLaine said, chuckling at 
the scenario. "It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 * Shirley MacLaine will perform her one-woman show at 8 tonight, Saturday and 
Sunday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court 
Drive, Cerritos. $35-62. (800) 300-4345. She will reprise parts of the show 
with Pacific Symphony on Nov. 18 and 19 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 20 at 3 p.m. at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa.

RARE BITS OF WELSH MELODIES; FOLK MUSIC: CUSAN TAN, WHOSE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE 
KITCHEN UTENSILS, BRINGS ITS UNIQUE SOUND TO SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the instruments employed by Welsh music group Cusan Tan to achieve its 
distinctive mix of new and traditional sounds are flute, guitar and Welsh 
triple harp. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and a meat mallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use kitchen utensils for percussion," said Ann Morgan Jones, reached by 
phone this week at a rehearsal in Martinez, Calif. "A meat mallet, mortar and 
pestle, the rim of a pottery jug. . . . They have to be home-groomed sounds." 
The group, whose name means "kiss of fire," plays tonight in the courtyard of 
the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, the first of 19 performances in as 
many days on a U.S. tour that ends in Troy, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was born in Aberystwyth, Wales, and left at age 15 to study flute at the 
Royal Academy of Music in London; now based back in Aberystwyth, she's lead 
vocalist for the band and writes its material. She also lived for several years 
in the Yukon, and when the quartet's regular guitarist, John Rodge, begged off 
the U.S. tour due to scheduling difficulties, she signed Yukon guitarist 
Manfred Janssen to fill in. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's secondary vocalist, Sue Jones Davies, also is an actress, and 
perhaps best known to Americans for her role as Rachel, a Welsh woman, in Monty 
Python's "Life of Brian." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies and Jones met four years ago picking up their children from school. "We 
were being mommies," Jones, 42, recalled. "I saw her on the first day of school 
and thought she was an interesting-looking woman. My friend said, 'I reckon 
you'd get on very well; she's an actress.'  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a cup of coffee. I asked Susie, 'Do you sing?' She said, 'As a matter 
of fact, I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the lineup is Robin Huw Bowen, a one-man crusade for the Welsh 
triple harp who continues his own North American tour when the band's tour 
ends. The triple harp has three sets of strings, as opposed to one on the 
Celtic or classical harp. Bowen's solo album, "Telyn Berseiniolfy Ngwlad (The 
Sweet Harp of My Land)," was released in the U.S. on Flying Fish Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Cusan Tan's first recording, called simply "Cusan Tan" and originally on 
Wales' Fflach label, was released in the U.S. this week by Firebird Music of 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was buoyed by this assessment in the Welsh Harp Society of America's 
journal: "Within the diminutive sea of neo-traditional and contemporary Welsh 
folk music available today, Cusan Tan sails alone." Jones seconded that 
opinion: "There isn't another band (like ours), certainly not in Wales." To 
illustrate her point, Jones, who also plays saxophone and piano, noted that she 
incorporates elements of New Age, jazz, even Tex-Mex and "a touch of 
semi-country" in her compositions. And before Cusan Tan, she said, the Welsh 
triple harp had been used strictly for traditional music. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in Jones' classical training as an orchestral flutist, and the group's 
palette of influences grows even larger. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might hear a Bach bass line in the piano," she said. "Sometimes we do a 
capella. I absolutely adore Steve Reich; I love Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also love schmaltz -- (Rodgers & Hammerstein's) 'Oh, What a Beautiful 
Morning!' was the first tune in my life that I loved. You can hear it all in my 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a definite 'multi' feel to it all," Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very odd back in Wales. We don't just play nice little folk songs. You 
can't find a category for us, and that's always a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Cusan Tan's sound may very well be unique, its topics are universal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three standards," Jones said, "life, love, death." 
</P>
<P>
 * Cusan Tan performs new and traditional Welsh music tonight at San Juan 
Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real, San Juan Capistrano. 7 and 9 
p.m. $3. (714) 493-1752.

THEATER REVIEW; SIMON'S 'PARK' HAS ITS BARE FOOT STUCK IN '60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The temptation of relocating any Neil Simon comedy -- especially any from his 
fecund 1960s period -- to the present is understandable. What harm could there 
be, for instance, in fast-forwarding his mid-'60s hit, "Barefoot in the Park," 
to the mid-'90s? Is his sweet little paean to young love in the big city all 
that dated? Have we really changed that much since then? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, and yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is the present" reads both Simon's script and the program for the 
Cypress Civic Theatre Guild production at the Cypress Cultural Arts Center. But 
"Barefoot" actually takes place in a very '60s kind of park, and no amount of 
script updating will change that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, taking Simon's play at face value, "Barefoot" reminds that the '60s -- 
Simon's '60s at least -- weren't that far from the '50s, when "the little 
woman" stayed at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon's little woman here is Corie (Judy Gish), whose every conscious moment 
seems centered on loading tons of love on her new husband, Paul (Daniel 
Schneider); or asking Paul every few minutes if he still loves her; or fretting 
intensely that her mom (Joan Neubauer) won't like their new, cramped walk-up 
apartment. When their suave, ever-so-continental neighbor Victor (Victor Mena) 
asks Corie if she's a singer, she says no, she's a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there may still be a few young housewives in mid-Manhattan brownstones, 
but it's a safer bet that there are none at all. Simon's Corie is actually a 
classic stereotype of the hysterical woman -- she decides to divorce Paul in 
the midst of their first authentic marital spat -- who depends on her character 
being defined by those around her. 
</P>
<P>
 She has one foot in the '60s (she can impulsively let her hair down, walking 
"barefoot in the park" for the hell of it), but the rest of her is planted in 
the Eisenhower era. 
</P>
<P>
 Why director Susan Marx and company decided to layer a '90s paint coat on this 
material is more than a bit odd. Little attempts at updating (a mention of 
Fidel Castro is replaced with a mention of Steven Spielberg) get confused amid 
the anachronisms. 
</P>
<P>
 When Paul shudders as he tells Corie that a married couple downstairs are of 
the same sex, or when Paul, Corie and mother look upon Victor's ethnic cooking 
like he's from Mars (ethnic cooking is part and parcel of places like New 
York), we have to wonder where we are. 
</P>
<P>
 Marx's cast -- and production -- looks a little confused too. Gish tends to 
screech her way through Corie's role, rather than find a comic pulse that might 
soften her retrograde character. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider falls into the trap of playing stuffed-shirt Paul stuffily, and 
loses Paul's rather healthy awareness of his absurd situation. In Mena's hands, 
this isn't a Victor who would sweep anyone off their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Phil Lubman's attractive, peach-colored apartment set is all wrong: Simon 
calls for dingy, cramped quarters where appliances don't go on and skylight 
windows are broken. (And why place a new sofa directly under the busted 
window?) 
</P>
<P>
 The brightest glimmer of comic light comes from Neubauer, who makes Corie's 
unsure mom her very own. Neubauer may fret a little excessively, but it's in a 
charming style that feels much closer to the tone Simon intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Jackson and Lee Parry make every one of their few moments as 
(respectively) a phone repairman and delivery man worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
 What's harder to figure is what's worth watching in a comedy as fixed to its 
original time and place as the Twist.

GANG FIGHTER; CRIME: ON A VIOLENCE-RIDDEN STREET, CLYDE JAMES, 83, SHOOTS BACK. 
BUT NEIGHBORS AND OFFICIALS CRITICIZE HIS TACTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Clyde James was stooping over to pet his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when four rounds and a few dozen pellets blasted through his front 
door, exactly where his head would have been. Luckily, only one pellet found 
its mark, tearing through his right shoulder blade. 
</P>
<P>
 The gangs were at it again. They had been stoning his northeast Los Angeles 
house for hours. Then they had gotten too close to the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 James, an 83-year-old retired electrician, drew his .38-caliber pistol and 
fired, John Wayne-style. The gang quickly fled this Ft. Apache, only to return 
with their guns. That's when his shoulder took the pellet.  
</P>
<P>
 For James, it was just another day on Drew Street, a notorious drug-ridden 
gang hangout tucked inconspicuously beneath Glendale's southern border, just 
east of Atwater Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that Drew Street is anything but inconspicuous, a hotbed of drug 
dealing. There were more than 200 narcotics-related arrests in 1992 on the 
two-block street, more than in the rest of the Police Department's entire 
Northeast Division. Drug dealing there has not abated, officers say.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the 22 years I've been here, there have been 15 to 20 homicides on that 
street," Officer Joe Galindo said. 
</P>
<P>
 James, who has lived in his small, pale blue house for 30 years, says he 
cannot afford to move. So he's defending his home with his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, this neighborhood is so ridiculous people would run away. But I'm 
not scared," James said in a slow but determined voice. "If they retaliate it's 
going to be hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Some would say it already is. In the past year, gangs have bombed, stoned and 
burglarized his house and vandalized his car. He thinks the gangs ran over his 
favorite Labrador retriever and left it to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were stoning the house for five hours and not a neighbor came out to 
assist me," James said about the June shootout. "They are afraid of the gangs!" 
</P>
<P>
 Police and James say he is a gang target because he fights back. Although he 
calls police when there's trouble, others in the neighborhood are afraid to get 
involved, officers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police do not advise people to shoot at gang members who terrorize 
them, some officers at the Northeast Division station a few blocks from James' 
house voice admiration for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fed up with it," Detective Joe Berumen said. "These people are selling 
dope at the front of his house. As far as I'm concerned he has every right to 
go out there and challenge these guys. In my opinion he is a hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither city officials nor neighbors agree with James' method of fighting 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking up a weapon will not solve the problem," said Connie Farfan, a 
community advocate from Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg's office who works with 
Drew Street residents. "That's not the way to go because he's only going to get 
hurt. In order to be safe he has to get along with the neighbors. Not all the 
neighbors are drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
 For three youths lounging under a tree near James' house one recent afternoon, 
James is just an old man they often see sitting on his front porch. There have 
been no problems with neighbors, said one youth, insisting that he and his 
friends are neither drug dealers nor gang members. Another said James' problems 
are with people from outside the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Drew and Estara streets, where James lives alone, where a gang name is 
written in fresh white paint in the middle of the intersection and around all 
the tree trunks and stop signs, the problem seems hard to stomach no matter 
where it's coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the gun around because there were other instances where my house was 
shot at," he said. "One time they were throwing beer bottles at me at 4 a.m. 
The police didn't come. I asked them to move. They didn't move. I took my gun 
out and they moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another time I had my house bombed. It was a glass bomb that hit on the 
windowsill and busted on the porch. I went out and looked. There were 14 
people. They said they just wanted to stir me up." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, James carries a revolver that seems too small for his big hands. 
He hopes it works -- he hasn't fired it in 30 years. Otherwise, James relies on 
the .38 and his four dogs, plus the protection offered by two thick redwoods, a 
pine, an avocado tree and a new metal fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The front porch is sealed off from the street with white pegboard scarred with 
big holes and sprayed with gang graffiti. One of the windows is shattered. 
Sitting on a ragged couch on his porch, cuddling his newly adopted Labrador 
retriever, James points out what he says are drug dealers waiting for customers 
and youngsters hanging about in matching gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house across the street used to be an old people's home and (President 
Ronald) Reagan did away with it. He wanted to spend that 3 trillion someplace 
else," he said. "The old folks there used to come over for avocados in my back 
yard." The dwelling now houses several families. James and several other senior 
citizens call the area's apartment dwellers "overnight people" because they 
move in and move out so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James, who retired 20 years ago, said his neighborhood has never been 
crime-free. But when he bought his house 30 years ago, the area was full of 
retired people. Over the years older people moved out and in the 1980s 
developers built low-rent, multiple-apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Farfan says James should try to work with city agencies and the police, who 
have begun to organize the Drew Street community and have reduced crime 
somewhat. But James says he is frustrated and impatient with teamwork because 
he doesn't speak Spanish in the predominantly Latino neighborhood, can't make 
friends and can't hear at all during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents in the area say fighting is counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can live peacefully with the gangs if you just leave them alone," 
said John Martinez, 67, of Atwater, who eats lunch with James and other senior 
citizens at the Glassell Park recreation center. "With a mixed neighborhood you 
should try to learn something about the culture of the other people and try to 
get along with them. If you carry a gun you're looking for trouble." Troubled 
Street 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Street, tucked incomspicuously south of Glendale and east of Atwater 
Village, is in one of Northeast Los Angeles' most drug-ridden neighborhoods, 
according to police.

NEW DRUG COURT SHOWS PROMISE, BUT FUTURE FUNDING IS UNCERTAIN; REHABILITATION: 
TREATING ADDICTS RATHER THAN JAILING THEM SAVES MONEY. ABOUT 100 HAVE ENROLLED 
IN INTENSIVE YEARLONG PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 1:30 on a recent dog-day afternoon and the young woman sitting before 
Judge Stephen Marcus has a sorry story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 She's explaining why she tested positive for drugs, explaining the kinds of 
slings and arrows of life that can send anyone reeling, in her case to get a 
fix. She tells of a return home one evening to discover her lodgings ransacked 
of many things she held dear, including personal mementos, birth certificates 
and the like, handed down by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge listens impassively but not unsympathetically. Marcus is familiar 
with the woman's history of drug abuse, but has decided she might respond to 
treatment in an innovative new program called Drug Court. As presiding judge of 
the court, he recognizes that relapses are an unfortunate but inevitable part 
of the treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm giving you a free ride," he tells the woman, scrutinizing her records and 
her face, in turn. He could have ordered her to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a promise to return for another progress report in two weeks, the 
woman walks out of the Criminal Courts Building as the judge turns his 
attention to the next case. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people have enrolled in Los Angeles County's Drug Court since it was 
inaugurated three months ago. So far it is receiving mostly favorable reviews 
from prosecutors, defense attorneys, drug treatment specialists and others 
involved in the pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug Court was designed to offer people arrested for drug possession a way to 
kick their habits and avoid criminal conviction and jail time. The catch is 
that they must agree to an intensive yearlong treatment program, involving 
daily counseling, group sessions, acupuncture, frequent urine tests and close 
monitoring of their progress by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The program represents a new way of thinking about drug users, recognizing 
that simply punishing offenders will not solve long-held addictions. The 
concept is an outgrowth of studies that show that treatment programs are not 
only effective but save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Those findings are borne out in a recent California survey, touted as the most 
comprehensive ever conducted in the United States, that concludes that for 
every dollar spent on treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, taxpayers realize 
$7 in savings, due to reductions in crime and health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But although the Los Angeles program has won widespread support, capacity is 
limited and it is uncertain if funds will be found to keep it going. Proposals 
to expand the local program and create more Drug Courts are even more tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns point up a problem that strikes the broad spectrum of drug 
treatment programs in Los Angeles County: there are simply too few resources to 
meet an overwhelming demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent federal studies indicate that nearly 18% of Californians admit to using 
one or more illicit drugs, while estimates for Los Angeles County are put at a 
minimum of 1 in 10, or about 900,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of the inmates in Los Angeles County jails are doing time for drug 
possession or sales, and an even higher percentage for other drug-related 
felonies, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The county 
spends about $25,000 a year for every inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 State and county officials estimate the total capacity of the county's public 
and private treatment programs to be 11,000 to 14,000. Of those, the county 
Health Services Department has fewer than 2,000 publicly funded residential 
treatment beds to offer, and they require an average waiting time of 18 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1982, the drug treatment system has become an impoverished community, 
it is malnourished," said M. Douglas Anglin, director of the UCLA Drug Abuse 
Research Center. "The political will to fund drug treatment programs 
disappeared, although that is slowly beginning to turn around." 
</P>
<P>
 Many drug officials are hoping the recently passed crime bill will yield some 
relief. The bill includes provisions for funding drug treatment programs and 
for expanding the growing numbers of Drug Courts cropping up around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our funding comes through federal sources, so we are very hopeful 
this will give us an opportunity to expand our programs; we certainly need 
them," said Wayne Sugita, director of development for county alcohol and drug 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But how much money the county will receive and when it will start flowing into 
the system remain uncertain. Los Angeles County's Drug Court is funded through 
May, but it may take a year to 18 months before federal funds are available to 
keep it going, said Judge Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone is going to have to go to the Board of Supervisors and ask for money 
to tide us over until the crime bill comes through," said Marcus, who estimates 
that the program needs about $250,000 to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the program has money to pay for only three residential treatment 
beds and people who need those services must wait up to three months, said 
Robert G. Espinoza, the Drug Court coordinator for Impact, a Pasadena-based 
program that has been contracted to evaluate prospective participants and 
provide counseling services. 
</P>
<P>
 Detoxification facilities are another component of a successful drug treatment 
program that is in short supply in Los Angeles County, said Espinoza. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only two hospitals in Los Angeles that we can utilize for 
detoxification, and then they have to get on a waiting list, so it's not a real 
option," said Espinoza. "When someone is physically addicted to heroin, I can't 
in good conscience go to the judge and say they are a good risk to put out on 
the street, because they are going to go out and get fixed. We have to ask them 
to stay in jail and kick their habit. A few have agreed to do that, but it's 
hard for them and for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Marcus said that the third phase of the program, which involves education 
and developing job skills, is still in its formative stages. No one is expected 
to reach that plateau until December, when coordinators hope to have developed 
a comprehensive program. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus would eventually like to see four regional Drug Courts operating with 
2,000 participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug Court officials are realistic about the success rates they are likely to 
achieve. So far, about 25 of the first 100 or so participants have dropped out 
of the program. Those who don't continue must go to trial on the original 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Optimistically, we hope to succeed with about 50% of the participants," said 
Marcus. "And to me success is someone who completes the program and goes a year 
drug-free. The most significant thing about Drug Court is that people don't 
just come with drug problems but . . . also have housing problems, job 
problems, relationship problems." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "In our case we also get a large number who are the hard-core 
unemployed or are transients. So the benefits of having a program like this 
work are enormous for society." 
</P>
<P>
 On another afternoon in Drug Court, a progress report for 26-year-old Freddie 
Balictar brought a smile to the judge's face. Balictar had tested negative for 
the past three weeks, as he has for most of the program with only a few 
relapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel kind of confident right now," he told the judge. "I've been feeling 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
 Balictar was one of the first to join the program nearly three months ago. It 
has come to dominate his life. He commutes by bus from his Panorama City home 
each morning to the Downtown counseling center and spends most of the day 
there, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, 
or just hanging out with other participants who share the same problems: the 
emotional baggage of addiction and the continual cravings for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 He quit his job as a salesman because he realized that kicking his cocaine 
habit demanded it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped working and had to start doing what this program wanted me to do," 
he said, sitting in a spare room at the counseling center a few days after the 
court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Balictar said he began using drugs -- first alcohol and then marijuana -- 
while in school. When the pot and booze no longer seemed to dim the pain he 
felt over the breakup of his family and his father's serious illness, he moved 
on to the harder stuff. He eventually overdosed several times, was arrested for 
driving under the influence and finally busted for possession. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he is ready to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize it's one day at a time," said Balictar, who may soon graduate to 
the second phase of the program if his next progress report is good. "This 
program really reinforces that when you start thinking too far ahead, you're 
focusing too much energy on the future and what might happen. The program has 
given me a chance to start a new life, and I'm really grateful."

TEACHERS OK PACT RESTORING 8% OF PAY CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An overwhelming majority of Los Angeles Unified School District teachers voted 
to accept a contract offer that restores 8% of a 10% salary cut, averting a 
potentially crippling strike but leaving few rank-and-file teachers content, 
union leaders said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of two days of balloting, announced Thursday evening by United 
Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein, showed that 19,513 of 22,004 
voting teachers, counselors and nurses approved the one-year contract that had 
been endorsed by union's board of directors three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nobody who said, 'Oh boy am I happy to vote for this,' because they 
still have a 2% pay cut," Bernstein said after the vote was tallied. "I 
personally hope fervently that this is the last contract that I have to 
negotiate with a negative in it. It's been too many years living with a pay 
cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with unprecedented deficits, the Los Angeles Board of Education has 
cut teachers' pay 10% for two years. This came on top of a 3% cut in the 
1990-91 school year, which is being slowly repaid. Other district employees 
also took salary reductions and suffered layoffs in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the approval of the 1994-95 contract, Bernstein said, does little to 
quell teachers' frustration over the issue of pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel there is still an incredible amount of hostility and anger . . 
. because the district has taken so long to get us out of this mess," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Mark Slavkin, who was unavailable to comment during the 
Yom Kipper holiday, said in a prepared statement that he was delighted the 
teachers accepted the contract, and called it a proud day for the school 
district because negotiations were not prolonged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that some of the anger generated by the 10% pay cut still lingers," 
Slavkin said. "There is no doubt teachers deserve to have all their lost pay 
restored. This will happen as soon as additional funding becomes available." 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of a strike intensified in mid-August, when union leaders rejected 
the board's first offer to restore salaries by 7% in a contract that contained 
several other contingency provisions that the union disliked. 
</P>
<P>
 But after three days of mediation, both sides agreed to present an offer to 
the union's 32,000-members that called for an 8% restoration -- 4% permanent 
and 4% guaranteed just for this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The district also agreed to eliminate the contingency clauses the union 
objects to and promised that if any new money comes in, half of it will 
automatically go toward further salary restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of how the district is going to pay for a 1% portion of the 
restoration, about $21 million, is still unresolved. Budget Director Henry 
Jones said he is still trying to figure out where the money will come from. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said the union already has its sights set on next year's contract 
and has retained an accounting team to monitor the district's budget with an 
eye toward finding money for complete restoration plus a raise for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel quite foolish accepting the offer, because we know that the district 
should have provided a full restoration," said Garfield High School English 
teacher Roberto Gallegos. "But we would feel even more foolish rejecting it. . 
. . It is attractive to teachers who have had to deal with a 10% pay cut these 
past two years."

FIRE TOOK 3 LIVES -- AND PART OF A NEIGHBORHOOD'S HEART; TRAGEDY: MARIA 
CASTILLO, WHO DIED ALONG WITH A DAUGHTER AND A FRIEND'S SON IN SOUTH GATE 
BLAZE, 'WAS THE KIND OF PERSON YOU LIKED TO BE AROUND,' A NEPHEW SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the last day of her life, 35-year-old Maria Castillo spent the afternoon as 
she often did -- chatting with a neighbor, watching her three young daughters 
play with her nephew as he kicked a soccer ball. 
</P>
<P>
 She would sit on the patio between her sister's house in South Gate and the 
little guest house behind it that Castillo rented from her for $500 a month. A 
latticed canopy covered in bougainvillea created a shady arbor for Castillo and 
the friends who visited, often with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the kind of person you liked to be around," said her nephew, Milton 
Castillo, 26. "The whole neighborhood knew her. They would gather here and talk 
and talk." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, on Tuesday night, she was settling in for an overnight visit with her 
childhood friend, Juana Hernandez, and Hernandez's sons, Eddie, 6, and Jairo, 
4, when a devastating fire engulfed the house. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Milton Castillo, the Hernandezes were supposed to be sleeping in 
the front room while the two women and girls were in the bedroom. But the 
6-year-old began playing with a lighter, and suddenly, lace curtains erupted in 
an inferno.  
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and her 4-year-old survived, but Eddie was pronounced dead at the 
scene. Maria Castillo's eldest daughter, Erica, 8, died later that night at a 
hospital, and Maria lingered for 24 hours on life support before dying 
Wednesday evening. Her 2-year-old twins, Vicky and Jessica, remained 
hospitalized Thursday at UCLA Harbor Medical Center, both of them in critical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Castillo had never had it easy in Los Angeles, arriving 10 years ago 
from the town of San Miguel in El Salvador. She had no job, she was estranged 
from her husband, she spoke no English. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maria had created for herself a warm and vibrant life, filled with 
children and family. When she arrived from El Salvador she lived with her 
54-year-old sister, Ana Soto, and her children -- including Milton Castillo -- 
in a house that Soto had managed to buy after years of hard work. Two years 
ago, Maria moved into the guest house. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto was in El Salvador the night of the fire, caring for her ailing mother. 
When she called home to Los Angeles on Wednesday and was given the news, "for a 
moment she lost control," Milton Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday she was at the bedside of Maria's children -- as the younger 
sister would have wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five weeks ago, Maria Castillo had told her sister of a horrible 
premonition, said Milton Castillo. "She kept complaining -- she was getting a 
lot of headaches and she said she was going to die soon," he said. "She said 
she wanted my mother to take care of the twins." 
</P>
<P>
 She was, according to family and neighbors, a devoted mother. She had worked 
for a while as a maid at a Glendale home, but after her twin daughters were 
born, one of them -- Vicky -- was found to have a disabling heart condition. 
Maria Castillo quit her job and cared for her daughter, administering the 
numerous medicines she required, nursing her after open-heart surgery six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She even won an award at UCLA for being a good mother," Milton Castillo said. 
"It was from the doctors and all the staff members." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vicky Castillo had been leading a more normal life, able to play with 
other children. "She was doing so well," said Milton, "that they said she 
probably wouldn't need another surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 As he talked about his aunt, Milton stood on the patio. Yellow police tape 
cordoned off the guest house, now just a shell with charred window and door 
frames. Inside, the remains of a sofa bed lay blackened and upended. Outside, a 
rosebush stood burnt. 
</P>
<P>
 From across the fence, the owner of the adjoining house fretted about the 
closeness of the fire and the number of people who died. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always put so many people in one place," Afton E. Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Castillo listened impassively, hiding any annoyance that he might have 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's reality," he said. "In a lot of Hispanic neighborhoods, they have a 
lot of people living in one apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 What was more of an issue here was the lack of smoke detectors in the guest 
house -- although fire officials are not sure that the devices would have made 
a difference in such a swift fire. Nonetheless, on Thursday, the mayor of South 
Gate called for an emergency ordinance mandating smoke detectors in every 
dwelling, and the City Council approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Coreas, 8, sat watching as neighbors came by to comfort family 
members. Erica was Elizabeth's cousin. "She was my best friend and my best 
cousin," said Elizabeth. "She wanted to be a teacher -- just like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others who came to the house, Elizabeth had her favorite memory of her 
aunt -- a woman who would always buy the girl ice cream from passing vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the charred ruins, relatives fished out one memento, astonishingly 
intact. It was Castillo's photo album, blackened at the edges, a little damp 
from water, but full of pictures that captured her as the family remembers her: 
long, wavy, dark hair, softly smiling, surrounded by her children.

COMPROMISE SOUGHT ON MOVE TO DEMOTE PARKS; CITY HALL: CHIEF WILLIAMS MEETS WITH 
COUNCIL MEMBERS IN EFFORT TO CURB OPPOSITION TO LAPD SHAKE-UP. A DEAL WOULD 
REPORTEDLY GIVE NO. 2 OFFICER FULL PENSION IF HE AGREES NOT TO SUE.

<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams -- locked in the most volatile political 
dispute since he took over the Police Department and facing new evidence of 
unhappiness with his management -- met Thursday with key City Council members 
to try to head off opposition to his reorganization of the LAPD's top brass. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to City Council President John Ferraro said Ferraro met with Williams 
and other city officials Thursday in an effort to reach a compromise that would 
prevent Bernard C. Parks, whom Williams demoted this week, from filing a 
lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the deal, it would allow Parks to retire 
with his salary and pension intact in February -- when he will mark his 30th 
anniversary with the LAPD -- while still clearing the way for Williams to 
reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for retiring at his highest rank and salary, Parks would have to 
agree not to sue the city, Mayor Richard Riordan or Williams, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro and other council leaders were scrambling for a compromise because 
Williams' abrupt reshuffling of the LAPD management has stirred an angry 
political reaction at City Hall. It also has sparked the first evident division 
between the council and the Police Commission, with commissioners saying the 
chief should have the latitude to manage his department while council members 
are reluctant to endorse Williams' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised and disappointed by the City Council rumblings on this," Police 
Commissioner Art Mattox said. "I would hope that the council would let Chief 
Williams manage the department and not interfere." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. and commission member Gary 
Greenebaum emphasized the need for Williams to be given authority to make 
command decisions if he is to be held accountable for the state of the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, council members who are loyal to Parks and others who are concerned 
about the structure of Williams' proposed reorganization have seized upon the 
reshuffling to raise questions about Williams' management of the department. 
After Williams' meeting with Ferraro, Councilman Richard Alatorre met privately 
with the chief to discuss his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several officials said Williams recently received a report from 
the Police Commission in which panel members faulted some aspects of his 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret that we have had some concerns about his slowness to move 
programs," one police commissioner said. "Some of that is reflected in the 
report." 
</P>
<P>
 That commissioner declined to elaborate, but others have said that the Police 
Commission and Riordan were concerned about Williams' failure to move more 
quickly on a highly touted LAPD expansion plan and on implementing 
community-based policing.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams has portrayed his decision to demote Parks as a reflection of their 
differing styles, and privately has accused Parks of undermining him. Among 
other things, Williams is said to believe Parks misled council members about 
the chief's position regarding a proposal to step up the hiring of female 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Williams blames Parks is not clear, City Hall sources said. In fact, the 
sources said Williams' lead liaison to the City Council on that issue was 
Deputy Chief Ronald Banks, whom Williams proposes to place in the new position 
of first assistant chief. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same sources said Banks had not tried to undermine Williams; instead, 
they said, Banks correctly informed council members that the chief would oppose 
a 43% hiring goal for female officers because Williams had expressed misgivings 
about the idea.

CLINTON TO VISIT VALLEY, MEET WITH WHIZ KIDS; POLITICS: PRESIDENT WILL BE 
GREETED BY LITTLE LEAGUE CHAMPS AND ACADEMIC STARS BEFORE DISCUSSING JOB 
TRAINING AT PIERCE COLLEGE.

<P>
 President Bill Clinton plans to make a quick visit to Los Angeles this 
weekend, where he is expected to meet with the San Fernando Valley's most 
famous youngsters -- athletic and academic -- before appearing at Pierce 
College in Woodland Hills, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is expected to meet privately with the Northridge Little League team 
and the Taft High School Academic Decathlon team at Los Angeles International 
Airport on Sunday afternoon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Clinton plans to attend two events at Pierce -- a private meeting with 
Los Angeles Unified School District students involved in job-training programs 
and a public meeting with 800 to 1,000 people to promote the Administration's 
school-to-work initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton likely will be accompanied by Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and 
Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley, along with Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ina Geller, a spokeswoman for Pierce College, said the President's advance 
team, including Secret Service agents, joined members of Brown's campaign staff 
on a visit to the campus Thursday afternoon to find an appropriate location for 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just sitting in my office at noon eating vegetables and in walks a 
whole group of people telling me they were here to scout locations," Geller 
said. "It was rather surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we're thrilled to have the President of the United States come to 
Pierce College," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The advance team, who walked around the campus in the sizzling afternoon heat, 
asked Geller for an ethnic breakdown of the student body, she said. The college 
has about 14,000 students, about half of whom are minorities, Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President will probably discuss his school-to-work program -- designed to 
steer students to employment -- when he appears Sunday afternoon, officials 
said. The event is expected to begin at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Konantz, the school district's director of career development, said he 
plans to bring students from around the city to the event, where the youngsters 
will discuss their job-training programs with the President. Several students 
will share the stage with Clinton, Konantz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his public appearance, Clinton is expected to attend a private 
fund-raiser for Brown at 20th Century Fox studios on Sunday evening. Clinton is 
expected to return to Washington on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Mort, who manages public relations for the Northridge Little League team 
-- which beat out all American teams for the U.S. championship but lost the 
international crown to Venezuela -- said the boys will be excited to meet 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," Mort said. "They're really having a great time and 
they're a great bunch of boys." 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-student Taft Academic Decathlon team beat whiz kids from around the 
country last spring to claim the national title after grueling competitions. 
The Taft group, made up of A, B and C students, took tests in 10 subjects to 
win local, state and national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Clinton's second visit in as many years for Mary Lee, the president 
of Pierce. She was president of Valley College when Clinton visited that school 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who is taking classes toward a law degree, told Geller she had a test the 
day before Clinton came to her campus last year and she has another exam next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just remarking about how he's ruining her grades in law school," 
Geller said. "But she is, of course, thrilled to have him come here."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEPUTY 
SHOOTS, KILLS MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY PULLED KNIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 43-year-old man was shot to death by a sheriff's deputy Thursday after the 
man allegedly pulled a knife on the deputy's partner at an apartment house near 
MacArthur Park, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Britta Tubbs, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Department, said the 
incident occurred at 11:50 a.m. while the deputies were conducting a check on a 
work-release inmate living at the complex at 1036 S. Menlo Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Tubbs said the deputies, one male, the other female, had just finished their 
assignment and were leaving the building in single file when a man shoved the 
male deputy past a self-locking security gate and then pulled the door shut, 
trapping himself with the female deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 He lunged at her and she was able to fend him off, but the man pulled a 6-inch 
steak knife and tried to stab her, Tubbs said. As they struggled, Tubbs said, 
the male deputy fired several rounds through the security door, wounding the 
man in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant -- who was not identified pending family notification -- was 
taken to California Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Tubbs said the dead 
man was not the inmate the deputies had checked on. The deputies were not 
identified.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; PUT TASTE BUDS TO ULTIMATE TEST THIS WEEKEND

 What's cookin'? Follow your nose to the seventh annual Taste of Encino this 
Saturday and Sunday and find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two dozen local restaurants and wineries will participate in the 
festival to raise money for local schools, including Adam's Rib, Chin Chin 
Cafe, Haagen Dazs and Preston Winery. Starbucks Coffee will serve cafe mocha 
and espresso. The event is sponsored by the Encino Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Some eateries have been preparing for the feast all week.  
</P>
<P>
 Adam's Rib owner Scott Hirschthal stocked up on 600 pounds of beef ribs, 800 
pounds of pork ribs and 100 pounds of kosher hot dogs. He also has nearly 1,000 
pounds of potatoes sitting in the restaurant's kitchen, waiting to be mashed 
with garlic and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for the entire community to get together, have a cookout and 
just have a great time," said Hirschthal.  
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Granado, owner of Angels Gourmet Take and Bake Pizza, said he expects 
to toss at least 100 pizzas for the crowd. His specialties include Margarita 
pizza, covered with basil, garlic and tomatoes, and a Napoli pizza topped with 
sausage, onions and red and green sliced bell peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Taste of Encino took in about $40,000, nearly half of which went 
to schools in the area. The remainder was allocated to the Encino Chamber of 
Commerce, which used the money for operating costs and its other projects, 
including an anti-graffiti program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Sobel, the chamber's executive director, said the organization hopes to 
take in at least as much this year. She said that although the event's main 
purpose is to raise funds for local schools, it is also designed to promote 
Encino restaurants and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to increase the visibility of the area," Sobel said. "I want the 
public to see how the chamber promotes Encino, and what it does for the 
community. That's why this event is so special. It brings the community 
together while helping out local schools." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, seven local schools will receive a percentage of the funds, based 
on how many volunteer hours they put in selling food and drinks over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is open to all schools in Encino. Participants this year include 
Taft, Birmingham and Zane Grey high schools; Mulholland Middle School; and 
Emelita Street, Nestle Avenue and Encino elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment for the event includes an arts and crafts fair as well as live 
music. Children's shows and the L.A. Cabaret Comedy Club will perform at 11:30 
a.m., 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will be from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Courtyard Shops of Encino, 
17401 Ventura Blvd., between Balboa Boulevard and White Oak Avenue. Off-site 
parking is available with a free shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily admission is $2, $1 for seniors and free for children under five. Food 
samples cost between $1 and $4. ALICIA DOYLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; BED TAX MAY RISE TO REDUCE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local officials are considering increasing the city's hotel bed tax from 8% to 
10% as part of a plan to address an anticipated $700,000 budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increase, which would raise an additional $50,000 per year, was 
one of several deficit-cutting measures outlined in the city's $5.6-million 
budget for fiscal 1994-95, which was approved in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will hold two public hearings on the proposed bed tax hike, 
at 7 p.m. Wednesday and on Sept. 28. Both will be at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nearby communities already charge a 10% bed tax, including Ventura, 
Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village, City Manager Terry Matz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Matz said Agoura Hills' tax would be less than the 12% tax levied by 
Calabasas, Malibu, Santa Monica and Los Angeles County, as well as the 14% 
levied by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernice Clark, director of sales and marketing for Radisson Hotel Agoura 
Hills, said the hotel -- the only one in the city -- is worried about the 
economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2% increase in the tax is "not a lot, but for the corporations in the area 
with which we deal, a 2% increase could put a great deal of burden on them," 
she said. "And anything that affects the local corporations affects the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 She said hotel officials will attend the hearings to express their concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Matz said he has met with Anthony David, Radisson's general manager, to talk 
about the proposed increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the City Council will consider Mr. David's concerns very carefully 
before they make any decisions," Matz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another deficit-cutting measure, a 4% utility tax, has set off a storm of 
controversy and a move to recall the entire City Council. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; ROBBINS' EX-TENANT DENIES TAKING GOODS 
</P>

<P>
 A former tenant accused of stealing expensive furniture and fixtures from the 
Encino home of former state Sen. Alan Robbins pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 
grand theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Titmas is scheduled to return to Van Nuys Municipal Court for a 
preliminary hearing on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and court records, Robbins leased his home to Titmas while 
he was serving a federal prison sentence for racketeering and tax evasion. The 
lease for the house on Oak View Drive included a purchase option. 
</P>
<P>
 But Titmas fell behind on his payments, filed for bankruptcy and was evicted. 
Court records say he told Robbins the furniture was placed in storage for 
safekeeping and that some of it had been auctioned by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 When Robbins was released from prison, he returned to a house that had been 
stripped bare, police said. He reported $92,000 worth of furniture and fixtures 
missing, including expensive Persian and Chinese rugs, a chandelier, a 
hand-carved dining table and 10 chairs, a designer toilet and bidet, two 
bathtubs and sinks, 10 doors and seven sets of drapes. ANN W. O'NEILL

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; LIBRARY TO EXPAND TO 6-DAY OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Encouraged by the likelihood of additional funding, the Agoura Hills library 
plans to significantly expand its hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been operating on a very limited scale for the last three years now, 
and libraries should be open at least five or six days a week," said Sy Rimer, 
community library manager of Las Virgenes Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting next month, the library plans to open six days a week, up from the 
current four days. Library officials haven't decided which day the library will 
be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new schedule will keep the library open 55 hours a week, more than 
twice as many open hours as now. The changes are subject to approval by Los 
Angeles County Head Librarian Sandra Reuben. 
</P>
<P>
 David Flint, the county library's assistant director for finance and planning, 
said the county will set up new operating schedules for most of the county's 
other libraries by mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes Library is now open Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 to 8 p.m., 
and Fridays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The funds permitting the library to extend its hours will come from a special 
assessment to raise money for the county's libraries, Rimer said. In Agoura 
Hills, residents will pay $28.50 annually per household for library services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agoura Hills City Council voted to join the special assessment district on 
the condition that Gov. Pete Wilson sign a bill prohibiting the state from 
taking money from library systems to pay its own bills, Rimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another condition was that the county library system agree to expand operating 
hours at the Agoura Hills facility. FRANK MANNING

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MALIBU; KEY PROVISIONS 
OF RENT CONTROL LAW STRUCK DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has struck down key provisions of Malibu's rent control 
ordinance -- and the owners of the city's two mobile home parks now are suing 
to recover $3 million in back rent and other losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the city attorney's advice, the Malibu City Council in 1991 adopted 
one of the state's strictest rent control laws, designed in part to protect 
tenants in the two parks from large rent increases and to correct alleged rent 
gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer ordered the city to stop enforcing 
provisions of the law that she had deemed unconstitutional, such as a rent 
rollback to 1984 base levels -- before cost-of-living increases were figured in 
-- and a two-year rent freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer ruled that although Malibu had the right to protect low-income 
residents by limiting future rent increases, the city had not proven that the 
rates were too high or had been raised unfairly, thus preventing park owners 
from getting a fair return on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is working on a proposal to settle the damage suit out of court.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WILSON 
SIGNS BILL CLOSING LOOPHOLE IN LOBBYING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a bill that closes a loophole in Los 
Angeles' tough new lobbying ordinance, giving the city and other local 
governments authority to monitor and regulate the activities of lawyers working 
as lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the legislation, signed by Wilson on Monday, cities can adopt ordinances 
requiring lawyers to report their lobbying activities and the amounts they are 
paid.Previously, lawyers in Los Angeles claimed they were exempt from the 
city's lobbying law because of the attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now an attorney who is working as a lobbyist will have to register and 
disclose the same information as anyone else," said Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria), who proposed the legislation at the request of Los Angeles 
city officials. "We wanted to make a level playing field."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MARINA DEL REY; CHANNEL 
DREDGING PLAN REJECTED BY COASTAL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission on Thursday turned down a proposal to dredge 
tons of contaminated debris from the entrance channel to Marina del Rey and use 
it as fill in the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners voted 10-1 against the proposal at a meeting in Eureka.The plan 
was presented to the commission by the Army Corps of Engineers in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said the corps failed to outline a long-term solution for 
handling the untreated sewage, trash, oil and other debris that is flushed from 
city streets into Ballona Creek channels and then into the marina. U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife officials expressed concerns that the project could hurt 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission spokesman James R. Raives said the corps is expected to resubmit 
its proposal today. If it does, the commission could vote on the issue again 
next month. However, the commission vote may have stopped the project because 
the corps says it needs to dredge before the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30 
or lose $1.7 million allocated for the project.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SEARCH FAILS TO FIND CONDO ASSN.'S MONEY

<P>
 Law enforcement officials say they aren't optimistic about recovering $1.4 
million the manager of a Calabasas condominium allegedly embezzled from the 
condominium owners association. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by Los Angeles police has failed to turn up any of the money 
allegedly stolen by Spencer John Gobus, 46, of Westwood, said Allan Fork, a Los 
Angeles County deputy district attorney who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be fair to say the LAPD has attempted to locate the money and they 
have not seized anything," Fork said. "From that, one would conclude that it is 
used up, spent." 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Gobus did not return phone calls seeking comment on the 
investigation.

 Gobus was arraigned last Thursday on charges of embezzling the money between 
Feb. 1, 1985 and July 31, 1993, when he operated a Westwood real estate 
management company. The company was hired by the Oak Park condominium 
association to manage the 268-unit complex on Park Granada Boulevard in 
Calabasas.  
</P>
<P>
 Gobus pleaded not guilty to the charges and, according to Fork, has been in 
jail on $1.4-million bail since his arrest. He faces up to six years in jail if 
convicted. A preliminary hearing has been set for this coming Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fork said the Los Angeles Police Department brought the case to his attention 
in April. The homeowners association, he said, became suspicious after Gobus 
failed to give it satisfactory answers to questions about the association's 
financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Gobus diverted money from the association's bank 
accounts to his own account. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend that he forged the signature of an association board member 
on a check. Fork said Gobus altered another check made out to him for his own 
services, writing in a higher figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Stone, a certified public accountant hired by the association last year 
to review its finances, said he discovered Gobus had not filed tax returns for 
the association for 10 years. Gobus had also opened several checking accounts 
without the association's knowledge, Stone said. He added that the 
association's board of directors at the time paid little attention to finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said his investigation into the association's financial records seems to 
indicate that Gobus spent most of the $1.4 million he allegedly embezzled on 
"personal expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 The condominium owners have been hard-pressed to maintain the complex since 
Gobus left his job in June, 1993, Stone said. At the time, the association had 
just $31,000 left in reserve. FRANK MANNING

POLICE TAKE TRAIN TO NAB UNSAFE DRIVERS IN CARS

 Aboard a slow-moving Metrolink train Thursday, Glendale Police Sgt. Jim Woody 
leaned against a window, cradled a portable radio close to his body and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 At intervals, he saw motorists crossing the tracks, then quickly notified a 
team of motorcycle officers waiting to issue citations at several of the city's 
railroad crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to somehow get the message out to prohibit people from doing this," 
Woody said. "The craziness of it is validated when you have three people in 
body bags" -- a reference to the three members of a family who were struck and 
killed by a Metrolink train last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a safety campaign that began more than two years ago, law enforcement 
officers throughout Los Angeles have boarded the trains to get a glimpse of 
what engineers see daily. Burbank and Glendale officers were getting their turn 
exactly one month after a young girl, her mother and grandfather were killed in 
Glendale while taking a popular shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains have struck and killed 26 people since operations began in 
1992, nine of whom were determined to be suicidal, according to a Metrolink 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Woody and two Burbank officers aboard a train used the radios to 
notify other officers of any violations they could see along a short route 
between Buena Vista Street and Chevy Chase Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Six motorists and one pedestrian were cited for ignoring the flashing red 
lights and crossing bars that warned of the approaching train. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver was grew angry after learning that the surveillance was part of an 
ongoing Metrolink safety campaign called Operation Officer on the Train. The 
train in this case had been specially reserved for television and newspaper 
reporters so they could witness the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a trap," said motorist Gordon Sanders, 60, who drove his white 
Lexus past warning lights. "The officer wasn't even aware of the vehicle code 
section he was citing me for. He had to look it up in a book. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went through the intersection, the red lights had just come on, but 
the crossbar had not moved," he added. "I argued with the officer that the red 
lights are kind of like the yellow light at an intersection, a warning to stop. 
But he didn't agree with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said he plans to contest the $250 citation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also cited were a 45-year-old motorist who said he was late for a business 
meeting and a pedestrian returning to work from a hamburger stand who walked 
around a railroad crossing bar. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal for vehicles to cross train tracks after red warning lights 
start to flash at railroad intersections. Trespassing on any other portion of 
the tracks is also illegal, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's event had been arranged months before the Aug. 15 tragedy. The 
victims had taken a popular shortcut across the tracks to avoid walking along 
the overpass. Metrolink workers have since fenced off access to the shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been hitting people because people aren't respecting the trains," said 
engineer Phil Nerkowski, who has been in control of trains that killed six 
people in separate incidents. "You get to a point where you put the train in 
emergency and there's nothing you can do but sit there and watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've handled it pretty good, but it can be a toll on you."

HIGH-TECH CELEBRATION OF ANCIENT RITE; YOM KIPPUR: WILSHIRE BOULEVARD TEMPLE 
USES AN INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA PRESENTATION IN MARKING THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Employing late 20th-Century technology to give relevance to an ancient rite, 
congregants at Wilshire Boulevard Temple on Thursday observed Yom Kippur -- the 
most solemn day of the Jewish year -- with an experimental interactive 
multimedia presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 While congregations throughout the Southland spent Yom Kippur, the Day of 
Atonement, in moving and traditional services, congregants at the landmark 
Wilshire temple followed their customary morning service with an hour of 
soul-searching aided by the high-tech program. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a first for the Reform congregation, complete with images flashed on a 
giant screen, readings by members of the congregation, and a mixture of music 
from rock to folk. 
</P>
<P>
 As high-tech as the program may have seemed, Senior Rabbi Harvey J. Fields 
said its roots could be traced to small villages in Europe in which faithful 
Jews in years past would interrupt their prayers on Yom Kippur, leave the 
sanctuary and go into an adjacent room to confess their sins to one another and 
beg forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Fields said, most congregants do not have an opportunity to discuss 
such themes after Yom Kippur services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that people needed to have an opportunity to come out of the sanctuary 
and deal with some of the issues confronted in the sanctuary -- sinfulness, the 
waste of the world's energy and the lack of appreciation for the essential 
beauty of the garden in which we live," said Fields, who wrote the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, as congregants meditated on the theme that "all that is left to 
us is our being horrified at the loss of our sense of horror," scenes of 
environmental pollution, military armaments, an exploding nuclear bomb and 
urban slums filled a giant screen in the temple's Piness Auditorium. In the 
background, rock music blared. 
</P>
<P>
 At another point emphasizing the holiness of God, there were panoramic film 
clips of thundering waterfalls, schools of fish and boiling white cumulus 
clouds filmed in time-lapse photography. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenes were interspersed with readings by Fields and individual 
congregants who played the role of 36 pious people commenting on the state of 
the world -- and of their souls. 
</P>
<P>
 The number 36 comes from the Babylonian Talmud, Fields said, which says there 
are at least 36 pious people in the world who every day see the face of God. 
They are said to be the vessels into which the suffering of the world flows. If 
even one of them were not here, the Talmud holds, the world would perish with 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogue, Fields said, is intended to prepare one for the final moments of 
repentance before "the closing of the gates" at the end of Yom Kippur. It is 
said that on Yom Kippur, God seals the Book of Life, which is inscribed at Rosh 
Hashanah.  
</P>
<P>
 The presentation appeared to be well-received by the estimated 600 congregants 
who participated. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Ellis of Los Angeles said afterward that he found the presentation 
"very meaningful and moving . . . another way to get at some of the messages." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Ginsburg of Beverly Hills said she may share a particular passage 
with students at the school where she is an assistant principal. "It was 
powerful. I thought it sent an important message," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have done a little wrong to another, let it be a giant wrong in your 
eyes," the passage said. "Go and rectify it. If you have done much good, let it 
be little in your eyes. If another has done you a little good, let it be great 
in your eyes. If another has done you a giant wrong, let it be a little in your 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields said he first experimented with a multimedia presentation in 1974 when 
he was a rabbi in New Jersey. He rewrote it for the Wilshire Boulevard Temple 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yom Kippur -- a time of fasting, prayer, introspection and personal confession 
-- began at sundown Wednesday and ended at sundown Thursday. It marked the 
close of the High Holy Days observances that began on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, 
the Jewish New Year, Sept. 6.

CITIZEN'S ARRESTS HALT DISTRIBUTION OF SYRINGES; HEALTH: NEIGHBORS FORCE POLICE 
TO CITE GROUP FOR GIVING DRUG USERS IN HOLLYWOOD CLEAN NEEDLES. THE TACTIC 
APPEARS TO CIRCUMVENT THE MAYOR'S EFFORT TO FACILITATE THE PROGRAM.

<P>
 Just a week after Mayor Richard Riordan declared a state of emergency to allow 
for the distribution of clean needles to drug users, police have been forced by 
neighborhood activists to arrest three volunteers handing out the needles in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers, all members of the group Clean Needles Now, were booked and 
released Wednesday night after half a dozen neighborhood activists placed them 
under citizen's arrest for breaking the state law that prohibits needle 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The group members vowed Thursday to continue distributing the clean needles as 
a means of reducing the transmission of AIDS through contaminated syringes. 
However, their arrests cast doubt on the effectiveness of the mayor's 
declaration, which directed law enforcement officials to make investigations of 
needle exchange programs a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan could not be reached for comment. But Capt. Glenn Ackerman of the 
LAPD's Hollywood Division said police had no choice but to take the group 
members into custody and cite them for their activities because state law 
barring syringe distributions supersedes any action taken at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it appears a lawful citizen's arrest has been made," Ackerman said, "law 
mandates us to accept that arrest."  
</P>
<P>
 Renee Edgington, the group's leader, and members Mark Haag and Mark Henrickson 
were detained for about an hour and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were cited for the possession of a hypodermic needle, a violation of 
the state Business and Professional Code. They have been ordered to appear in 
court Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making the arrests, police also confiscated about 100 of the 
group's needles at its distribution site at Cosmo Street and Selma Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The police action was taken at the request of several Hollywood citizens 
groups who say the needle exchange program condones illegal drug use and 
attracts derelicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone to get AIDS via dirty needles or by any other means," 
said Joe Shea, president of the Ivar Hill Community Assn., who participated in 
the arrest efforts Wednesday night. "But we just can't (support) this on public 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Clean Needles Now and city officials counter that the distribution 
effort is essential to stem the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Programs like these have a significant impact on the lives of people who are 
at risk for HIV disease," Henrickson said. "It seems pretty clear, the time is 
now for Los Angeles to get involved in some sort of intervention with drug 
users. If they wait too long, it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Edgington said she and other group members plan to distribute needles again 
next Wednesday at the site, even if it means risking another arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are there are drugs in Hollywood," said Edgington, whose group has 
been conducting needle exchanges throughout Los Angeles for the last two years. 
"The services need to be as visible as the drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, Riordan -- at the urging of Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg of 
Hollywood -- declared the emergency and directed the city attorney and Police 
Department to avoid initiating investigations of needle exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and several Northern 
California counties have used similar declarations as a way to combat the 
spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the concerns of the residents in Hollywood, however, Riordan said 
the exchanges should be conducted in "stable, secure locations developed in 
consultation with residents of the community, business owners and other social 
service agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Goldberg's chief deputy, Sharon Delugach, said the councilwoman 
was trying to secure another location in the Hollywood area to distribute the 
needles. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened Wednesday night didn't serve anybody," Delugach said. "It 
didn't serve the taxpayers. It didn't serve the Police Department. It didn't 
serve the community at large. All the resources could have been put into saving 
lives."

JUDGE LETS JACKSON PLEAD 5TH; COURTS: THE SINGER AVOIDS ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN 
CIVIL CASE ABOUT WHETHER HE MOLESTED CHILDREN. HIS LAWYERS SAY THEY ADVISED THE 
LEGAL MOVE EVEN THOUGH HE IS INNOCENT. 
</P>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that pop superstar Michael Jackson can 
plead the 5th Amendment in a civil case, enabling him to avoid answering 
questions under oath about whether he sexually abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Charles Mathews, representing five former Jackson security guards who 
have filed suit against Jackson claiming that he fired them to conceal his 
child molestation, said Jackson is hiding behind the 5th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Jackson had the opportunity today to come into court and say he is 
innocent," Mathews said after the hearing. Instead, Matthews said, Jackson 
"gets up and says, 'Sorry, I want to take the 5th because my answer could 
incriminate me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's attorneys said the singer wanted to testify that he was innocent, 
but given that he may face criminal charges, his defense team advised Jackson 
to stay silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson "maintains that he is innocent," said Carl Douglas, his attorney, 
accusing Mathews of grandstanding. "As an experienced criminal attorney, 
(Mathews) knows full well the obligations of one's counsel when they are facing 
serious charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has not been charged with a crime. A grand jury disbanded in July 
without indicting the singer, but the statute of limitations on child 
molestation charges runs six years, and the district attorney's office has not 
said Jackson is in the clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who had wanted Superior Court Judge Richard C. Neal to force Jackson 
to admit or deny firing the guards as part of a cover-up, complained that this 
was the first time a defendant had used the 5th Amendment in not answering 
allegations in a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found not even one (similar civil) case," Mathews said, "and the 5th 
Amendment has been around for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said he had to "fall back on basic principles, and the basic principle is 
a fairly simple one, that we don't use our judicial process to make someone 
incriminate themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The guards, all fired Feb. 1, 1993, sued Jackson in November. In the suit, 
they said they had seen boys between the ages of 9 and 14 going into Jackson's 
private quarters in his Hayvenhurst Avenue estate in Encino and not emerging 
until the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges that one guard, Leroy A. Thomas, was ordered to retrieve 
a Polaroid photo of a naked boy from Jackson's private bathroom and destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews said the guards had cooperated with the district attorney's office and 
filed the suit, which is scheduled for trial in April, after they became 
convinced that charges would not be lodged against Jackson. Mathews called his 
clients "good men, moral men." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Jackson's attorneys, Zia Modabber, has another view. "They want 
money," he said Thursday. "They don't want (Jackson) to admit or deny anything 
for any real purpose."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POLICE SEEK HELP IN FINDING 'STETSON 
BANDIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man dubbed the "Stetson bandit" for wearing a 10-gallon hat in a string of 
three bank robberies apparently dropped his disguise in his fourth crime, when 
he robbed $3,000 from a Great Western Bank branch in Glendale last week, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police released a photograph taken by the bank's security camera 
during the Sept. 10 robbery, showing a white man between 30 and 40 years old, 
with thinning blond hair and sunglasses. They said they hope someone will 
recognize the suspect and turn him in. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that this individual may live in the (Glendale) area, or that 
he could be working in the area," said robbery Investigator Will Currie. "Then 
again, with his brazenness, it's possible that he's not from around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the first in the spate of robberies took place Aug. 29 at a 
Wells Fargo branch in Montrose. In that crime, a man wearing a cowboy hat and 
sporting a mustache and slight beard walked into the bank, pointed a gun at a 
teller and escaped with $2,650. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 3, a man matching the same description robbed $1,085 from a Union 
Federal Bank branch on Glendale Boulevard in Silver Lake. On Sept. 7, a teller 
at the Citizens Bank branch on Foothill Boulevard in La Canada was robbed of 
$150. In each case, witnesses told police the man carried a small handgun and 
put the cash into a bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had obtained bank-camera photos of the man taken during the previous 
robberies, but Currie said the picture from the Great Western heist provides 
the clearest image of the man thus far. Also, witnesses reported seeing the man 
escape in a mid-1980s Chevrolet mid-size pickup that had no rear bumper.  
</P>
<P>
 The robbery in La Canada was the first such crime in that city in nine months, 
and it so alarmed officials there that they held a meeting with local bank 
managers and an FBI investigator Monday to discuss a possible ordinance to 
force banks to install security doors and hire guards. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada Mayor David Spence said city officials implored area bank managers 
to take steps to ward off robbers, but does not plan to legislate any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to prevent robberies is to make your particular bank appear to 
be a hard target for a potential robber," Spence said. "That could take the 
form of having an armed security guard, or having only one entrance and exit, 
but it's up to the individual bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Currie said Glendale police will distribute pamphlets with the suspect's 
picture to area banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope someone recognizes him, but the problem is, he could put on another 
mustache and a different hat and look completely different," he said. STEVE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; FIRM DELIVERS ELECTRIC CARS FOR POLICE USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Green Motorworks, based in North Hollywood, delivered the first four of six 
electric cars it developed for use by Alhambra police this week. The vehicles 
will be used in parking enforcement. And William Meurer, founder of Green 
Motorworks, hopes they will demonstrate how effective electric cars can be and 
how much energy they can save. 
</P>
<P>
 Meurer, who started the company three years ago, believes it was the first 
electric car dealership in Southern California. "I wanted to do something to 
improve the environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, Meurer got help from Calstart, a public-private consortium 
trying to convert defense technologies into electric vehicle uses. He also got 
some federal funding so he could install new higher-performance batteries in 
three of the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cars ordered by Alhambra has an on-board computer to keep track of 
how much time the car is in use, but not moving. Unlike gas-powered vehicles, 
electric cars do not idle when they are at rest and so save energy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meurer, who has sold more than 30 of the Kewet electric cars, believes that 
parking enforcement programs are ideal for proving the value of that feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Green Motorworks converted gas-powered vehicles to electric. Last 
year, the company also started importing Kewets from Denmark. The cars ride on 
special tires hand-made in Luxembourg that are meant to minimize rolling 
resistance, Meurer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kewets are smaller than standard compact cars and cost about $14,000, said 
Meurer. They have a range of 35 to 45 miles on a single charge and reach a top 
speed of about 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 For what Kewets are capable of, "they're expensive," Meurer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars are replacing the city of Alhambra's gas-powered Cushman three-wheel 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meurer predicts the electric cars will have a life span of between 100,000 and 
150,000 miles. "Just remember to change the brushes in the motor at 80,000 
miles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, electric cars are mostly for hobbyists, said Meurer. But he said he 
is looking forward to a day when mass-produced, affordable electric cars are 
available. ED BOND

 Scissors in hand, photographers ready, Councilman Richard Alarcon was poised 
to cut the ribbon in front of a group of third-graders on hand to witness the 
opening of a new Homework Center at the Pacoima branch of the Los Angeles 
Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 But first Alarcon, a former teacher, had a lesson for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I cut this ribbon, that symbolizes the gift of knowledge we are giving 
you," he said. "But you have to promise me you are going to take care of it. 
You have to nurture it and when you are ready, you will use it to help your 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused a second, then asked, "You promise?" 
</P>
<P>
 The children, mostly from Haddon Avenue Elementary School, nodded their heads 
and Alarcon cut the ribbon, after first pretending he was going to cut a girl's 
ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima branch had been closed for five months by the Northridge 
earthquake. And the ceremony Thursday marked the beginning of a new era for the 
facility, said Lupe Canales, the senior librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the 12th city library in the past year to get a computerized homework 
center, which includes access to a reference database, educational games and 
word processing. A similar homework center opened earlier at the West Valley 
library branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The children have been full of enthusiasm since the computers were first 
installed about two weeks ago, Canales said. Some immediately started pounding 
on the keys, jamming the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me two hours to get them working again," Canales said. Since then, 
access to the computers has been limited so that programs could be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 The children will be trained on how to use the machines properly, but the 
computers have made an impact already, library officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers, which cost nearly $20,000 including software programs, were 
acquired through a donation from the California Community Foundation and the 
Library Foundation of Los Angeles. The software programs include one for resume 
writing that adults can use when looking for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, 9-year-old Stefanie Allen of North Hollywood was scrolling 
through the offerings on one of the six new computers, looking for a reference 
to Michael Jordan. "Michelin" was on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not here," she said. She was advised to try looking up Jordan. But 
before she got to Jordan, she spotted a listing for Elton John and pulled it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the songs," she said. "Right now I'm looking for books that I can 
read." 
</P>
<P>
 David Haut, a spokesman for the city library, said officials want to put 
homework centers in as many branches as possible, but that depends on the 
availability of funds. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; GROUP TO REPLACE TREES ALONG STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An organization that promotes reforestation of urban neighborhoods is sending 
off shoots in a Sherman Oaks neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning at 9 a.m., a group of neighbors and about 40 volunteers will 
plant 11 Bradford pear trees along the 4900 block of Van Noord Avenue to 
replace trees that the city removed because their branches were getting caught 
in overhead wires. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon and Rick Mayer said their idea for the tree planting took root soon 
after they completed training as urban foresters offered by TreePeople, a 
nonprofit environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day course taught them not only proper techniques for planting trees, 
but also the importance of replenishing the dwindling numbers of trees in urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 TreePeople is lending money, equipment and expertise to the project, and local 
businesses are donating refreshments to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Mayer said she hoped that people who heard about the event would be 
inspired to plant trees in their neighborhoods as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to making everything look nicer, it makes property values go up," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city removed sweet gum trees whose branches were tangled in wires about 35 
feet high and whose roots were buckling a nearby sidewalk. The pear trees, 
which are now eight feet tall, are expected to grow to a maximum height of 30 
to 40 feet. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PUPILS PUT HIM FIRST IN HIS SECOND CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who left a successful career in the entertainment business at age 40 to 
launch a second career in teaching is Glendale Unified School District's 
nominee for 1994 California Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Bartosiak, a history teacher known to his seventh-grade students at 
Roosevelt Middle School simply as "Mr. B," was chosen for his "magnetism" in 
the classroom and an ability to motivate and involve students on a campus that 
has one of the highest numbers of at-risk youth in the district, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is always fresh for the particular class at hand," Roosevelt Principal 
Judith White said. "His lessons are dramatic, exciting and startling. Students 
actively participate, and no one wants to miss his class." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1992 to 1994, Bartosiak, now 47, was elected by the Roosevelt student 
body as the school's teacher of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his decision to become a junior high school teacher was not an easy 
one. It came after Bartosiak had spent years as a student, earning a doctorate 
in Russian language studies at UCLA. He had taught at the college level and 
worked a variety of jobs, including seven years as a well-paid talent 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a comfortable salary, but when I was turning 40 I was going through a 
change of life and I said, 'what do I want to feel when I'm turning 50? That I 
negotiated another $10,000 an episode for somebody?' " Bartosiak said. "I was 
always torn about what I wanted to do when I grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Bartosiak became a substitute teacher in Glendale, taking stints at 
each of the district's middle and high schools. He said he fell in love with 
Roosevelt instantly, and was eventually persuaded by Principal White to take a 
full-time position there, even though it required him to go back to school to 
complete a teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had always been dead-set against becoming a teacher, having been 
raised by a single mother who struggled to support her family on a 
schoolteacher's salary. But he said he is glad he made the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the first day that I walked into class, when I knew I was responsible for 
these kids and they were responsible to me, I knew this is what I wanted to do 
for the rest of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartosiak, who speaks five Slavic languages, said his students speak about 40 
different native tongues. As a teacher, he said he tries to show that the 
school's rich ethnic mix is an advantage, not an obstacle.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of at-risk kids here, but since the background I have is 
multilingual, I show them that we can celebrate the diversity. It's not just a 
catch phrase, it really is valuable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said Bartosiak's nomination was approved by a panel 
of administrators and will be submitted to the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education, which will select 12 teachers from 65 nominees countywide. STEVE

AHMANSON'S PUBLIC PARKLAND AGREEMENT MAY BE IN JEOPARDY; SIMI HILLS: THE 
DEVELOPER MIGHT NEED HELP TO PURCHASE 10,000 ACRES IN RUNKLE RANCH AND CORRAL 
CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. officials, who agreed to convert 10,000 mountainous acres 
into public parkland before beginning construction of a mini-city in the Simi 
Hills, said Thursday they may not be able to hold up their end of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 To purchase Runkle Ranch and Corral Canyon for parkland, and proceed with 
their development, Ahmanson attorneys said they might need help from the county 
or parks agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first step, they asked for more time to buy the rugged parcels in the 
Santa Susana Mountains and Malibu Bluffs. But after a three-hour hearing, the 
Ventura County Planning Commission Thursday rejected Ahmanson's request for a 
three-year grace period. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the commissioners voted 4 to 0 to stick to the deadline as stated in 
the binding development agreement: Ahmanson must turn over the open space by 
December, 1995. If the company fails to deliver the parkland, the county will 
automatically revoke the developer's permits to build 3,050 dwellings and two 
golf courses on the Ahmanson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that they cannot dig a single foundation until they convert Runkle 
Ranch and Corral Canyon to public parkland, Ahmanson representatives said they 
will appeal to the Board of Supervisors to give them more time to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Breathing room is needed, they said, because a tangle of lawsuits against the 
project have tied up Ahmanson executives in court for the past two years, with 
litigation threatening to drag on for many months. 
</P>
<P>
 But they acknowledged that they have no idea how much the parcels would cost 
-- or even whether owner Bob Hope intends to sell the parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospect of us acquiring that open space is uncertain," Ahmanson attorney 
Allen Camp said. "I hope the properties are available and I hope we can pay 
fair-market value for them." 
</P>
<P>
 If Hope's price proves out of reach, Ahmanson officials said they might need 
help acquiring the land. Hope's attorney could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The county could give Ahmanson's efforts a boost by moving to seize the 
parcels through eminent domain, Camp said. Under that scenario, a court would 
very likely arbitrate a price for the land. Ahmanson would then reimburse the 
county, Camp said, and begin building the mini-city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're willing to spend the money when it's right and smart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But parks officials worry that Ahmanson may never deem the time "right and 
smart" to spend money -- at least, not the kind of money that would be required 
to purchase 4,700 acres of spectacular mountain property. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they predicted, Ahmanson might seek to offer a deal: a less-dense 
development in return for a waiver of the open-space requirement. To make up 
for the lack of parkland, Ahmanson could offer other incentives, said Joseph T. 
Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they'll come back (to the supervisors) and say, 'Hey, how would you 
like three sheriff's stations, two libraries, an extra overpass and a new 
flagpole?' " Edmiston told the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson attorney Camp acknowledged that the developer might seek to modify 
the project if the parkland acquisition proves infeasible. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said any changes to the development agreement would require a lengthy 
series of environmental analyses and public hearings -- and could leave the 
developer vulnerable to more lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we would be nuts to do that," Camp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not convinced that Ahmanson will stick to the original deal, Edmiston proposed 
trying to lock the developer into buying Runkle and Corral for parkland. He 
asked Ahmanson to stake its landholdings as collateral for a standby letter of 
credit, which would guarantee a stream of cash to buy the properties and 
prevent the developer from crying poor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Camp rejected that request as "unwarranted overkill." He added: 
"Suggestions (that we give) additional pounds of flesh seem to be 
inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 County Planning Commissioners Robert Muraoka and the Rev. Johnie Carlisle Jr. 
agreed that the county should not require a letter of credit. After all, they 
said, the existing development agreement contains a rock-solid guarantee: no 
parkland, no project. 
</P>
<P>
 While they sided with Ahmanson on that point, the four commissioners present 
rejected the developer's request for more time to complete the land transfer. 
They said Ahmanson executives had willingly agreed to the 1995 deadline, even 
though they knew several groups were planning to file lawsuits against the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahmanson is in the risk business," Commissioner Sue Boecker said. "The county 
is not." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen people, including supervisorial candidate Trudi Loh, spoke against the 
developer's request for an extension of the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financial risk is part of any real-estate development," said Janice Lee, a 
Calabasas homeowner opposed to the project. "As Kenny Rogers says, never count 
your money while you're sitting at the table." 
</P>
<P>
 By denying Ahmanson's request for more time, Lee told the commissioners, "The 
message you'll send will be: 'Mr. Developer, honor your obligations.' "

 A teen-age driver was killed Thursday when he ran a stop sign and was struck 
by a truck, critically injuring one passenger and causing another, a pregnant 
woman, to go into labor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old driver was airlifted to Antelope Valley Hospital, where he 
died, investigators said.He was driving south on 90th Street West with a 
carload of friends when he failed to stop at the intersection with Avenue I 
about 1 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sustained severe head injuries when he crashed through the windshield, said 
Officer Kerri Hawkins of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers in the car included Irene Hall, 26, of Rosamond, who was nine 
months pregnant. Hall, who suffered minor injuries, underwent an emergency 
Cesarean section at Antelope Valley Hospital, where she was reported in fair 
condition. A hospital spokeswoman would not discuss the baby's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Another passenger, Christina Mulalley, 16, was listed in critical condition at 
Antelope Valley Hospital with a possible fractured pelvis and a damaged liver. 
Jannelle Schaller, 18, was taken to Lancaster Community Hospital with a skull 
fracture and fractured pelvis, and Brad Phipps, 16, was taken to Lancaster 
Community Hospital with a fractured pelvis, said CHP Officer Rick Chisham. All 
are from Rosamond.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BANK SEEKS DISMISSAL OF SUIT BY FIRED 
EXECUTIVE; COURTS: VALENCIA NATIONAL DIRECTORS SAY THE WRONGFUL TERMINATION 
ACTION BY ROBERT MANLEY, THE SANTA CLARITA FINANCIAL INSTITUTION'S FORMER 
PRESIDENT, CONTAINS UNSUPPORTED ACCUSATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Valencia National Bank directors have asked a court to dismiss a $2-million 
wrongful termination lawsuit filed by the bank's former president. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials said the suit, filed by Robert Manley, 51, is full of legal 
holes and unsupported accusations, according to court documents obtained 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley, one of the founders of Santa Clarita's only local bank, contends he 
was fired June 1 because he was cracking down on delinquent loans to board 
members. Bank officials have admitted losing hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in 1993 because of defaulted loans to board members, four of whom resigned as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 They said, however, that no current board member has a delinquent loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials have labeled Manley's accusations a smoke screen to cover up 
what they say are the real reasons he was fired: a decline in bank earnings 
from 1991 to 1993 and complaints from shareholders about his management style. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal documents asking that the suit be thrown out of court were filed by the 
bank's attorneys Wednesday in Superior Court in Van Nuys. The documents state 
that Manley served "at the pleasure" of the board and that the board was, 
therefore, allowed to terminate him at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents state that a legal basis for a claim of wrongful termination 
would exist if Manley was fired for refusing a board request to perform an 
illegal action, or if he reported alleged violations of the law by the board to 
a government agency. But the bank stated that Manley does not claim in his 
lawsuit that either occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley declined to comment on the bank's statements because he has not seen 
them. But he said he still believes his accusations will stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we have a good case," he said. "Otherwise, we wouldn't have filed the 
lawsuit in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman Lou Garasi and attorneys for the bank could not be reached for 
comment. Bank President Charles Goldstein said he could not comment on the 
documents because he has not seen them. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley's lawsuit names the bank and its eight current board members as 
defendants. Board members are Garasi, Eugene Burke, Charles Albre, Richard 
Keysor, Walter Fisher, Richard Patterson, Robert Nahabit and Joseph McKeon, 
brother of Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita.)

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNCIL VOTES TO RAISE BUS FARES; 
TRANSPORTATION: PRICES FOR ONE-WAY TICKETS WILL INCREASE TO $2.50 FROM $2 FOR 
ADULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bus riders traveling between the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys will 
need more pocket change beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to raise the cost of 
one-way fares for adults by 25% and to increase other ticket prices to a lesser 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult fares will go up from $2 to $2.50 for one-way rides, from $40 to $43 for 
20-trip ticket books and from $65 to $70 for monthly passes. Tickets for 
students, senior citizens and disabled riders are half of the adult fare. 
</P>
<P>
 City transit officials established the three express lines -- 796, 797 and 798 
-- after the Northridge earthquake and say the rate increases will make fares 
comparable to other commuter lines now operating from Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 riders use the express routes daily between the Santa Clarita and 
San Fernando valleys, according to city Transit Manager Ron Kilcoyne. 
</P>
<P>
 The city pays $1.1 million to provide the service. It now recovers 20% of the 
cost from ticket purchases, and will recover an additional 10% with the fare 
increases, Kilcoyne said. The new ticket prices begin Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bus passengers complained about the rate increases, saying they will 
discourage people from taking the bus at a time when city officials should be 
encouraging ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they prefer to raise rates gradually, and backed off on 
even greater increases that would have priced 20-trip ticket books at $50 and 
monthly passes at $80. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to raise your fares $15 a month, you're going to lose riders," 
said Jack Hamilton, a Santa Clarita resident who has ridden the express bus 
service since it began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me, we're raising it a whole big hunk at one time," said 
Councilwoman Jan Heidt, before voting on the smaller increases. "I know we have 
to adjust it, but can't we make it less painful?"

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE APPROVES 1-YEAR PACT WITH L.A. 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT; LAW ENFORCEMENT: COUNCIL OKS CONTRACT AS CITY OFFICIALS 
PREPARE TO REVIEW THE COUNTY-RUN AGENCY'S PERFORMANCE.

 The Palmdale City Council has approved without comment a one-year contract 
with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for general police services, 
but declined to sign a five-year deal sought by the law enforcement agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year contract is worth about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are preparing to conduct a performance audit on its contract 
with the Sheriff's Department, as well as several other city agencies. The 
audit will review the sheriff's service calls, its 911 calls and the time used 
for patrols, City Manager Bob Toone said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the audit is being conducted to increase the effectiveness of 
sheriff's services. 
</P>
<P>
 One patrol car operating eight hours a day, seven days a week, costs the city 
about $226,000 a year, said Lt. Dave Collin of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's 
Station, which patrols Lancaster and Palmdale. That amount includes all support 
services, from the "station captain's salary to the pens and pencils," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Collin said he welcomes the upcoming audit because he believes the Sheriff's 
Department services are worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, city officials said they wanted a one-year contract with 
the department because they were concerned they were not getting their money's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we do a good job, and I think the city of Palmdale will find that out 
when they conduct their audit," Collin said. "I welcome it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department provides law enforcement services for 41 cities in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Wednesday night, the City Council approved a plan to construct 
a third park-and-ride lot on West Avenue S because current lots are constantly 
packed to overflowing.

</P>

<P>
 A 41-year-old Valencia woman driving 80 m.p.h. died Thursday after losing 
control of her car and crashing into a utility pole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-car accident occurred about 2:50 p.m. on Pico Canyon Road just west 
of The Old Road, said Officer Wendy Moore of the California Highway Patrol.The 
woman, identified as Ann Elizabeth Gomez, was driving a Pontiac Grand Am 
westbound when she drove onto the right dirt shoulder and struck the pole.

 Moore said Gomez apparently was not wearing a seat belt and was thrown out the 
back window of the car. Gomez was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN TO RUN SHERIFF STATION DETECTIVE UNIT; 
INVESTIGATIONS: LT. BARBARA PERSTEN WILL FOLLOW LT. HARVEY CANTOR, WHO WILL 
RETIRE TODAY AFTER NEARLY 30 YEARS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Barbara Persten joined the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department nearly 25 
years ago as a secretary hoping to attend law school. But instead of carrying a 
briefcase, she now jokes about buying a trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year-old sheriff's lieutenant has been named head of the 19-member 
detective bureau at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. She is the only 
woman currently supervising a detective bureau at a sheriff's substation. 
</P>
<P>
 Persten replaces Lt. Harvey Cantor, 59, who will retire today after nearly 30 
years with the department. Persten, formerly a watch commander at the sheriff's 
station, begins her new job Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Persten downplayed her role as the female head of a detective bureau, 
observing that other women with higher ranks work as detectives at the 
department's central headquarters. In addition, at least one other woman has 
supervised a detective bureau at a sheriff's station in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't find it often, but it's not new," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Persten said she has worked in jails, on street patrol and as an administrator 
since becoming a deputy in 1975, but her favorite experience with the 
department has been 13 years of various detective work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was always more interesting to put those clues together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Persten, who lives in the west San Fernando Valley with her husband and 
2-year-old daughter, hasn't given up on the legal profession yet. She hopes to 
become a judge someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantor, on the other hand, said he plans to continue his detective work as a 
private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia resident started his career at the old Newhall Sheriff's Station 
in 1965 and worked a variety of assignments before returning to Santa Clarita 
in 1986. He was briefly assigned to the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station in 
1987, returning to the Santa Clarita station a year later. He was named head of 
the detective bureau in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is retiring, his badge will remain active. His daughter, Judi, is 
a deputy at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic and has been assigned 
the badge Cantor wore as a deputy when he joined the department.

MIKE PENNER: STRIKE BRINGS SLIVER OF HOPE TO ANGEL FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I look out the window on this, The Day After, I see no mushroom clouds. No 
scorched earth. No low-level radiation. No Mad Max types in bombed-out dune 
buggies, scavenging through the rubble for tattered remnants of Southpaw and 
Ribbie and smoldering Angel-Mariner ticket stubs. 
</P>
<P>
 If this was the end of the World Series as we know it, then I feel fine, 
because no more major league baseball in 1994 also means: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No outside distractions for baseball fans as they wheel in the cases of 
light beer and the industrial-strength-sized bins of pork rinds and curl up for 
all 18 1/2 hours of Ken Burns' "Baseball" documarathon, basking in warm 
sepia-tone memories of how grand the old game was before Budhead Selig and his 
murderer's row of small-market bobos got their hands on it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No more haranguing over whether a third tier of playoffs would ravage "the 
integrity of the game." Purists got their wish -- there will be no wild-card 
teams in the postseason tournament this fall. How's that integrity thing 
holding up, guys? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Still no team with a losing record in the playoffs. A 25-year tradition is 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No more World Series games starting so late that the very fans the sport 
now desperately needs to court -- aged 12 and under -- can't stay up to watch 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, because Gene Autry is fed up with the current state of the game, a new 
ownership group for the Angels will soon be in place -- very likely, some time 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, as in life, it is good for the spirit to look at the bright side 
whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's a shame that the fans in Cleveland have waited 40 years for 
nothing, that Montreal's wildly successful do-it-yourself program won't have 
the chance to keep the World Series trophy in Canada, that Padre supporters 
have been denied the only joy they have known since 1984 -- Tony Gwynn's 
eminently plausible run at .400. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is big league baseball, post-apocalypse, where the words to survive 
by are Every Man For Himself. The owners are in it only for the owners. The 
players care only about the common good of the players. If either of these 
statements were untrue, a full schedule of American and National League games 
would be on tap tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 No, altruism is out, self-absorption is in. Extend the same ground rules to 
the fans and the Orange County ticket buyer is going to find little reason to 
don a black armband in support of his or her brethren in Cleveland or 
Cincinnati. The Orange County ticket buyer is going to ask, "What's in it for 
me?" and the answer will come ringing back: "More than you ever could have 
dreamed." 
</P>
<P>
 If the collapse of the 1994 baseball season was enough to drive the Autrys to 
sell, then every Angel fan should have the front page of Thursday's doomsday 
sports section framed and mounted over the fireplace. A flicker of hope, 
finally. 
</P>
<P>
 You know it, I know it, the American people know it -- there's only one way 
the sad situation with the Angels is ever going to improve, and that is with a 
change in ownership. Managers get sacked, players are dumped and general 
managers play musical office chairs, but responsibility for what hasn't 
happened with this franchise the last 35 years rests with those who pay the 
bills -- and who, most recently, have refused to pay the going rate for 
presentable talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autrys lost interest some time around 1991, when they spent huge sums to 
have Dave Parker and Gary Gaetti anchor a can't-miss pennant chase -- and the 
ship wound up on the ocean floor, with the crew sleeping with the fishes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough to fault Gene on that one, the disappointment of '91 coming on the 
heels of the disillusionment of '87, coming on the heels of the despair of '86, 
coming on the heels of the frustration of '85, coming on the heels of the 
aggravation of '82, coming on the heels of the first 20 years of unfulfilled 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Autrys sold the team then, most fans would have nodded and 
commiserated. The Cowboy gave it his best shot, let the poor man finally have 
some peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gene and Jackie held on grudgingly for three more seasons, slashed 
the payroll nearly in half, spread the misery and soured their ever-resilient 
fan base to the point where the strike was not only welcomed but applauded. At 
last, something to break the monotony. 
</P>
<P>
 This is how far the bottom line has fallen in Anaheim: Included in the owners' 
salary-cap proposal was also a salary floor -- a minimum that teams must spend 
each year on talent, somewhere between $26 million and $28 million. The Angels' 
payroll for 1994 was $23.3 million, meaning that they would have needed to 
spend about $3 million more just to reach the owner-implemented salary minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, much of the requiem reportage on television and in the newspaper has 
attended to the "winners" and "losers" of the strike. Such discussion reminds 
me of 1980s Cold War rhetoric -- remember this old favorite: "Is a nuclear war 
winnable?" -- and I cringe every time I hear that the owners "won." 
</P>
<P>
 What, exactly, did they win? 
</P>
<P>
 If turning the ballgame over to the lawyers, burying the Baseball Encyclopedia 
in truckloads of legal briefs, gambling that their life-giving antitrust 
exemption won't be revoked by Congress and risking total anarchy when 700 
ballplayers refuse to sign contracts and declare themselves free agents is to 
be considered "victory," then Philadelphia won the World Series last year, the 
Texas Rangers are a dynasty and Anthony Young is a modern-day folk hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, the owners lost this one, the players lost this one and the fans, for 
the most part, lost this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, maybe, for a plucky group of hardcores in Orange County, who have 
steeled themselves for years with the thought that before things got better, 
they most likely had to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pennant races and a World Series have been canceled. Worse has been 
attained. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel fan looks out the window again, thinking about what has been 
sacrificed and what might be gained, down the road, as a consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 The cloud cover seems to be lifting. Could that be the sun, getting ready to 
break on through?

ST. LOUIS LEASE IS SETTLED; PRO FOOTBALL: OFFICIALS TRYING TO ATTRACT RAMS HAVE 
SECURED USE OF NEW FACILITY, CLEARING THE WAY FOR RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS TO 
BRING TEAM TO THEIR CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The sticky stadium lease issue that has hindered St. Louis' efforts to land an 
NFL team was finally resolved Thursday, clearing the way for the city to resume 
negotiations with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw had broken off talks with St. Louis on Aug. 10, when 
it became apparent the city might not be able to secure use of the 
$258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium, currently under construction in St. 
Louis, for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday's announcement that St. Louis beer distributor Jerry Clinton had 
sold his 30% share of the lease to FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium), the 
nonprofit group trying to secure a team, pushed St. Louis back into the hunt 
for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to talk to the Rams, and I think we can put together a very 
competitive offer," St. Louis County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall said at a 
St. Louis press conference. "I think we're going to get the Rams here. I'm more 
confident than ever. The lease was the big obstacle, and now that's behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw could not be reached Thursday night, but Heidi Sinclair of the Los 
Angeles office of Burson-Marsteller public relations firm, which has been hired 
to handle questions regarding a possible move, indicated that the news bodes 
well for St. Louis, one of three cities -- Baltimore and Hartford, Conn., are 
the others -- aggressively pursuing the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to say anything until we have a chance to take a look and see 
what has really gone on," Sinclair said. "Then we'll issue a statement (today) 
about starting up negotiations again." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis may have to take a number outside Shaw's office, though. Shaw is 
scheduled to meet today with members of the Orange County-based Save the Rams 
Task Force. Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer and Baltimore Oriole 
owner Peter Angelos, who is heading Baltimore's efforts, are scheduled to meet 
with Shaw in Los Angeles early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach-based sports agent Leigh Steinberg, Save the Rams co-chairman, 
said he will unveil an enhanced package to the Rams that includes guarantees 
for the purchase of season tickets and luxury suites in a refurbished Anaheim 
Stadium and an offer, backed by several investors, to buy the Rams for between 
$150 million and 200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram owner Georgia Frontiere said she would consider selling a minority 
interest in the team but has said repeatedly that a controlling share is not 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their team and they may not have an interest in selling it, but we 
wanted to make that proposal available," Steinberg said. "The economics of our 
(new) deal are much better than what was proposed three weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
 That Save the Rams offer included a $50 million to $70 million renovation of 
Anaheim Stadium, construction of a new office and practice facility near the 
stadium, and a $50 million infusion of cash through the purchase of a minority 
interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would make the point again that the Rams have been in Southern California 
for 49 years and have been loyally supported for most of them," Steinberg said. 
"I believe our offer will guarantee the Rams a level of profitability." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis has guaranteed huge profits for the Rams -- the new stadium lease 
calls for an NFL team to receive all concession, in-house advertising, luxury 
suite and club seat revenue -- but until Clinton relented Thursday, all the 
city could offer was 54,000-seat Busch Stadium, which has no luxury suites or 
club seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But that won't be necessary thanks to Thursday's deal, in which FANS agreed to 
pay Clinton $4 million within 48 hours and another $4 million if an NFL team 
relocates to St. Louis and Clinton does not become part owner. Clinton will 
also receive use of a luxury suite for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Civic Progress, a coalition of the 28 largest businesses in St. Louis, has 
guaranteed loans for both payments. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis attorney Thomas Eagleton, a former U.S. Senator who was recently 
named chairman of FANS, said the city will soon begin selling luxury boxes and 
season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a happy day," Eagleton said. "I talked to the Rams and they're very 
pleased. They've been encouraging us from the very start to get a clean lease." 
</P>
<P>
 Former New England Patriot owner James Orthwein had given up his 65% share of 
the lease to FANS in June but Clinton, whose bid for an NFL expansion team last 
year failed, refused until Thursday because he said he wanted to use his 30% 
share of the lease as leverage to bring a team to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 5% of the lease was owned by two smaller investors who conveyed 
their shares to FANS Thursday, as well. But Clinton, who said he spent $8.5 
million in the expansion effort, was always considered the stumbling block to 
the city's NFL hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Clinton the Rams' clock was ticking," Eagleton said. "It was time to 
remove oneself from the pot."

AUTRY: NO BIG CHANGES ARE PLANNED; BASEBALL: ANGEL OWNER SAYS TEAM IS NOT FOR 
SALE AT THIS TIME BUT HAS HAD PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH PROSPECTIVE BUYERS. 
</P>

 Angel owner Jackie Autry said Thursday she has assured the front-office staff 
that there will not be sweeping personnel changes if the club is sold before 
the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people come in and (throw out the baby) along with the bath water, and 
they run into more hot water than they ever imagined," Autry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we bring in someone, we want them to be sensitive to the staff." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi and his assistant, Tim Mead, are working without 
contracts but neither said he felt any anxiety over the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your performance is your salvation," Bavasi said. "If you do a good job, and 
work hard, you get opportunities. If we didn't do that and weren't trying to 
improve the organization, then we should worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be distracting to me, or anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Mead said, "Regardless of what happens, we're going to have to be judged on 
our performance, and that's the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Autry denied a report in Thursday's editions of The Times that she and husband 
Gene Autry are trying to sell the club for $130 million. The report said the 
Autrys were selling 23% of the club for $30 million, with the option to 
purchase the rest of the club within six months of Gene Autry's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one outside myself knows about this," Autry said. "Gene doesn't even know 
about it. That's why I've been so sensitive and careful to keep it out of the 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have told interested parties the club is not for sale at this time, and 
that remains the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Autry said that she is trying to sell only a minority interest in the club and 
that the minority owner would immediately be in charge of day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources close to Autry insist that a prospective buyer would be a 
minority owner only until Gene Autry's death. The buyer would be required, 
however, to pay $3 million each year to retain the option, which would be 
deducted from the $130-million purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry has engaged in only preliminary talks with four prospective buyers. She 
said that she has yet to choose a suitor and would not identify a front-runner, 
but the Walt Disney Co. apparently is falling out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker owner Jerry Buss said Thursday that he was interested in buying the 
Angels but has yet to negotiate with Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing's going to happen on this until the labor issue is resolved," Autry 
said. "It's just not beneficial to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are one of four teams for sale, the others being the San Diego 
Padres, Minnesota Twins and Pittsburgh Pirates. The only sale that appears 
close to being consummated is that of the Padres, who are negotiating with 
Texas businessman John Moores. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in our front office are more worried about the labor situation, and 
possible layoffs, than new ownership," Mead said. "Besides, right now we don't 
even have enough people in our offices to field a softball team."

RAIDERS RUN OUT OF GAS; PRO FOOTBALL: TYRONE MONTGOMERY AND FRIENDS HAVE BEEN 
STOPPED COLD IN SEASON'S FIRST TWO GAMES.

<P>
 Nine carries for 15 yards in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are not numbers to brag about when you are a starting tailback in the 
NFL. Just ask the Raiders' Tyrone Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Other backs around the league -- Emmitt Smith and Marshall Faulk, for example 
-- get as many as nine carries in a single drive. Montgomery holds the dubious 
distinction of being the NFL's least-used starting tailback, with an average of 
only 4.5 carries a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrating? You bet. Especially when everyone from national commentators to 
Coliseum security guards blame the Raiders' running game for the team's 0-2 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The running game has been taking an unjust beating," Montgomery said. "In 
order for us to move the ball on the ground, it takes all 11 guys on offense to 
click together." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are correct when they point out that the Raiders' 133 yards rushing 
leaves them last in the AFC and 25th in the league in that department. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's 38-9 loss to Seattle, Raider running backs Harvey Williams, Tom 
Rathman and Montgomery combined for only nine carries and 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to look at that and say that our running game is off," Coach Art 
Shell said. "We just didn't run the ball enough. We should have run the ball a 
little more than we did. We have to give our running backs more of chance than 
we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Montgomery, much of the criticism has been directed at him 
because he is listed No. 1 on the team's depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it is very frustrating," said Montgomery, who gained 106 yards in a 
part-time role last season and accounted for 79 yards in total offense in the 
Raiders' wild-card playoff victory over Denver. "No one wants to be criticized. 
I just go out there and give 110% effort whenever I am on the football field." 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming the focal point of the Raiders' running game has happened quickly for 
Montgomery, who is the younger brother of former NFL running backs Wilbert and 
Cle. Only two seasons ago, Montgomery was a rookie developmental squad wide 
receiver who doubled as a running back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I do think about how fast the change has been made," he said. 
"But, it's a situation I prefer to be in. I like the weight on my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' game plan each week has called for them to establish some type of 
rushing attack. Once the game starts, however, execution has been a problem. 
San Francisco and Seattle both forced the Raiders to go to the air early after 
taking first-quarter leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made adjustments to run the ball against every opponent, but we haven't 
executed well as a team," Montgomery said. "So far, we've played against two 
aggressive teams that take pride in their run defense, and it just so happens 
that we've come up short." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Raiders may get the break they need against Denver, which is 
17th in the league in run defense and will be without injured linebackers Mike 
Croel and Dave Wyman. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Seattle and San Francisco were aggressive, Denver has a more laid-back 
defense," Montgomery said. "This could be the week that we start clicking." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season began, it was obvious that Montgomery could be a strong 
pass-catching threat in the backfield. But the Raiders have used him mainly as 
a decoy or as a dump-off receiver. He has only two catches for seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that I would like to do more because I'm a competitor," 
Montgomery said. "Whenever you're content, you stalemate yourself and, of 
course, I would like to contribute more to help us win. But, that's the way 
everyone on this team feels." 
</P>
<P>
 When training camp began in July, many figured that Montgomery's status as the 
Raiders' starting tailback was in name only because of the off-season addition 
of Williams, who signed as a free agent from Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite limited play in the first four exhibition games, Montgomery remained 
as starter, then clinched his starting role with a solid effort against Houston 
in the final exhibition, gaining 53 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Harvey here is good for me because we all need competition to make us 
better," Montgomery said. "It has never been Tyrone versus Harvey. It's just 
been for us to work together and help get our offense going." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery realizes that the Raiders are desperate to get more production from 
the running backs and that a lineup change is a possibility.  
</P>
<P>
 "A move like that would not surprise me because a lot of moves are made every 
day in this league," he said.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; SEASON ENDS EARLY, BUT THERE STILL ARE FIREWORKS TO 
COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most exciting baseball season in recent history is gone. The debut of the 
new playoff format is gone. The World Series, sadly, is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do they go from here? Who can tell, but with major league owners locked 
into the salary cap or an equivalent mechanism designed to depress salaries and 
deny mobility, this much seems certain: 
</P>
<P>
 There is no area of compromise, no halfway point, in the collective bargaining 
negotiations still confronting owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
 It still seems likely that the owners will go for blood, that before Nov. 1 
they will declare an impasse and unilaterally implement the win-at-all-costs 
salary-cap proposal, threatening the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be no surprise to union leader Donald Fehr, who has insisted from 
the start of the 35-day strike that the owners were intent on implementing and 
have never deviated from a proposal and plan aimed at breaking the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr picked up a new believer in the final hours before acting -- acting, 
indeed -- commissioner Bud Selig canceled the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego attorney and longtime player agent Tony Attanasio, encouraged by 
three owners he would not identify, called Selig Tuesday night to offer a 
concept that seemed to draw some interest from Selig, Attanasio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig was summoned to a conference call and had his daughter, Wendy 
Selig-Prieb, the Milwaukee Brewers' general counsel and a member of the owners' 
negotiating committee, call Attanasio back for a fuller explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Attanasio suggested that the sides adopt the payroll and revenue tax plan, 
with an increase in the tax, that the union had proposed five days earlier and 
which had been rejected so quickly, Fehr said at the time, that it was "almost 
insulting." 
</P>
<P>
 Attanasio also suggested that a model of the owners' salary-cap proposal be 
run alongside the tax plan to try to prove to the union that the cap isn't such 
a bad idea. He suggested a five-year trial, during which either side could 
reopen after two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 He also proposed that the owners and players initiate joint ventures in 
marketing and international baseball and that a union representative sit on the 
committee that selects the next commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Attanasio had been one of several agents -- Randy Hendricks, Ron Shapiro and 
Tom Reich prominent among the others -- who had been talking to owners and club 
executives in an effort to keep the process alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig-Prieb told him they would weigh his proposal overnight. She didn't tell 
him her father was preparing a draft of his cancellation announcement at the 
same time. Attanasio said he got the call the next morning: Thanks, but no 
thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I gathered from her is that it didn't deliver the pound of flesh that 
the owners are determined to take from the players," Attanasio said. "I was 
terribly disappointed to have the idea rejected out of hand, but it made me 
realize that the whole thing was predetermined, as the union had tried to tell 
me. The owners never had a Plan B, never made a counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I explained my concept to him, Selig told me how disappointed he was 
that the union had been totally inflexible. I said they gave you a tax plan and 
some revenue-sharing ideas and the only thing they're saying no to is the 
salary cap, and that it's been the owners who are inflexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that if the Series goes down, he'll be the one remembered for 
taking it down, not Don Fehr or Dick Ravitch. I also told him that he seemed to 
have four choices. He could take the players' tax plan. He could jam the cap 
down the players' throats, which wouldn't work. He could take a combination of 
the two, or he could choose the fourth, absolute disaster. I hoped sanity would 
prevail, but he chose the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Absolute disaster in the form of an implemented system that the union will 
employ every legal option to fight, including resumption of the strike next 
spring, when owners may try to lure minor league players across the picket 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolute disaster in the form of owners trying to promote, market and sell 
tickets for a season that may never be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolute disaster in the form of widening mistrust that, in Fehr's view, stems 
basically from the owners' freedom to do anything they want under their 
antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr and Selig are expected to be in Washington on Sept. 22 to appear at 
another House hearing on the exemption. Fehr will also begin a series of 
regional meetings with players next week. There are no negotiations on the 
immediate docket, but the owners' Player Relations Committee is considering 
asking the union for a 30-day moratorium on legal action by either side while 
negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if they want to drop bombs and then do lunch," Attanasio said. "Some 
owners to this day won't admit they were part of collusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Can they get beyond the dislike and mistrust, a level of animosity that Jerry 
McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies, says is the most disheartening aspect 
of his first two years in baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, with the World Series gone and nothing to save except 1995, 
that animosity seems to have been a unifying aspect among owners, whose 
solidarity continues to survive the probe of skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 An American League owner recently reflected on the owners' tendency to 
capitulate in seven previous negotiations and said, "I'm afraid that some of my 
colleagues became intoxicated this time with the concept of winning, of drawing 
blood. I would have to admit that some owners do sense a chance to break the 
union." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig denies that, says it has never come up, and confines union busting to 
another time and place. The mistrust, however, is real, the anger among owners 
as strong as when he first encountered it as a freshman owner in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through many commissioners, through many different heads of the Player 
Relations Committee, through Marvin Miller and now Don Fehr . . . 
unfortunately, we're still in the same boat, and that's what's really 
frustrating," he said in his Wednesday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it really proves is a sad and tragic sense that both sides have failed. 
We can't even seem to establish a common ground on the most elementary of 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of that failure, contributing to his decision to cancel the World 
Series, is already eating at Selig. Owners tried to tell him that the media's 
"Bud Bashing" represented institutional hits, but Selig was on the phone 
Thursday, calling a reporter here and there to wonder why he is being blamed 
for canceling the Series when it is the players who have been on strike for 35 
days. A partnership is one thing, but let's put the blame where it belongs, 
Selig seemed to be saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Fehr said: 
</P>
<P>
 "When people think back to what the final image of the 1994 season will be, it 
may be Bud Selig at a press conference in Milwaukee protesting pain and 
gnashing teeth but nevertheless going ahead and dashing the hopes and dreams of 
many people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was their decision to make, and they decided their circumstances were more 
important."

MIKE DOWNEY: THESE ANGELS CAN'T DESCEND MUCH LOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the endless summers, poor seasons and very bad years the Angels have 
had, this one is by far the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with an earthquake that took out their scoreboard and sent their "Big 
A" itself listing like the Poseidon. 
</P>
<P>
 It continued with the sudden and inexcusable dismissal of their manager, Buck 
Rodgers, a man who was getting the most out of this ballclub's limited talent. 
</P>
<P>
 It worsened with the Angels' becoming the worst team in baseball's worst 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 It hit bottom with the death of the ageless, guileless, peerless Jimmie Reese, 
king of the fungo, friend and angel guardian to Nolan Ryan and Bo Jackson and 
Jim Abbott and more. 
</P>
<P>
 And just when you figured there is no place lower than bottom, the Angels 
descended again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Autry said she and her husband Gene, upon the cancellation of the rest 
of the baseball season, have had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 They are expected to sell their beloved Angels, presumably to the highest 
bidder. Could be the nice mice from Disney. Could be the fat cat Marvin Davis. 
Could be some new Player, capital P, to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Autry is stepping out of the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no cause for celebration. I don't care how poorly the Angels have been 
run for the last 30-odd years. Gene Autry was totally and hopelessly devoted to 
this cause. It meant as much to him as anything he did on film on horseback. He 
deserved better. He got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere up in Heaven, Jimmie Reese couldn't bear to watch Wednesday. The 
baseball players he adored, the ones he rapped grounders and popped pop-ups to 
all day long, were nowhere to be found. Jimmie was the foreman on Gene Autry's 
ranch. But all the hired hands had gone into town. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark day at the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a splendid TV special on Channel 5 a few weeks ago, assembled 
meticulously by KTLA sports producer Cathy Karp, in celebration of Angel 
baseball throughout the years. Each segment was bumpered by images of Gene 
Autry in his heyday, saying howdy ma'am and ridin' off into the sunset and 
such. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Gene really is riding off into the sunset. Oh, he has broadcast holdings 
and a fine Western Heritage museum bearing his name and who knows what else in 
his saddlebags, but by far his most public persona was as owner of the Angels, 
the losin'est team in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to wonder why the Angels never were ridiculed around the country as 
hopeless losers similar to the Red Sox and Cubs and Indians. After all, what 
had the Angels ever won? At least those other clubs had been in a World Series, 
once upon a time or twice. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I realized, there is no sense of life-or-death passion among Angel 
fans, no sense of emotional need that would leave anyone with a bad case of the 
summertime blues, should the Angels flop again. Boston, Chicago, Cleveland fans 
care deeply about their teams, go into long funks over their failings. Nobody 
cares that much about the Angels.  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody but Mr. Autry, who has been their constant companion. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, who is now the hands-on boss of the business, said with obvious 
sorrow Wednesday that it mattered not whether her husband had $300 million in 
the bank or not one penny. They were done with the Angels for good. They had 
had it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene and Jackie evidently are asking $130 mil for the whole shebang. Even so, 
he cannot completely tear himself away from the team he loves. A proviso will 
be made that less than one-quarter of ownership profits will change hands while 
Mr. Autry is still around, which we hope will be forever. Nevertheless, the new 
owner will call the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 All this haggling and bickering, all these spiraling costs and deepening pools 
of red ink, they all got to be too much. As Jackie Autry put it, "This has been 
like a freight train coming down the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene could stop a runaway stagecoach, but not a train. You can't rope a train. 
</P>
<P>
 He made mistakes. He put the wrong guys in charge. He put too many guys in 
charge. He got poor advice. He got good people and then let them get away -- 
Abbott, Dante Bichette, Rodgers, Whitey Herzog. He put champagne on ice and 
watched it go flat. He came so close but remains so far away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gene Autry regime, the Angels knew joy but never fulfillment. They had 
individuals but never the whole team. They lost strong young men to gunshots 
and accidents and watched teammates careen off a turnpike in a capsized bus. 
They abandoned the team's most popular players and brought in some of the 
sport's most obnoxious. 
</P>
<P>
 All along, you rooted for two guys. You rooted for Jimmie Reese, and now he's 
gone. And you rooted for Gene Autry, who is parting company. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardon my sentimentality, because it really hasn't been much of a baseball 
team. But I offer my sympathy today to Mr. Autry, who stuck with it through 
thin and thinner. His only Champion was his horse.

LAME-DUCK LEAGUE; THE ONCE-PROUD SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE WILL CEASE TO EXIST BY 
SUMMER OF 1996 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How does a conference die? More easily than you think. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Southwest Conference, the end came painfully, convincingly and perhaps 
unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference that gave college football 99 consensus All-American 
selections, 13 Hall of Fame coaches, six wire-service national champions, five 
Heisman Trophy winners and one infamous victim of the NCAA death penalty will 
cease to exist by the summer of 1996, the first major conference to perish in 
the new sports order. 
</P>
<P>
 SWC headquarters are a virtual ghost town. Only 11 staff members, including 
interns, remain on payroll. There isn't much to do except count the days, 
update resumes and wonder what happened to a league that lasted 80 years and 
then suffered a coronary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're small and getting smaller," said Commissioner Steve Hatchell, who left 
his job as Orange Bowl executive director to run the league in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone will have to turn off the lights. If it isn't Hatchell, who's busy 
trying to find a home for the conference archives, maybe the SWC can enlist Don 
Meredith, the former Southern Methodist quarterback, who always knew exactly 
when the party was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Windegger, longtime athletic director at Texas Christian, was sitting in 
the dentist's chair not long ago when his 
</P>
<P>
 doctor inquired about the availability of Horned Frog mementos. Windegger felt 
a pain -- not in his tooth but in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around this league for 40 years now," he told the dentist. "Why 
don't you just hang my rear end on the wall and you'll have all the tradition 
and mementos you need." 
</P>
<P>
 This is hard for Windegger and everyone else who grew up with the SWC. Somehow 
this league went from Dana X. Bible, to John W. Heisman, to Sammy Baugh, to 
Jess Neely, to Bobby Layne, to Raymond Berry, to Bear Bryant, to John David 
Crow, to Darrell Royal, to Frank Broyles, to Tommy Nobis, to James Street, to 
Earl Campbell, to Bill Yeoman, to Eric Dickerson, to Ken Hatfield, to Andre 
Ware, to John Mackovic . . . to oblivion. Just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tradition dies hard," said Windegger. "Something 80 years old, you hope that 
tradition means something." 
</P>
<P>
 It meant nothing. Instead, the SWC is a memory-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it happened: DOMINO NO. 1 
</P>
<P>
 THE MONOPOLY ENDS 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly half a century, the SWC cornered the Texas football market. 
Saturdays belonged to Davey O'Brien, Doak Walker, Kyle Rote and John David 
Crow. Sundays belonged to the Baptist and Methodist worship services, followed 
by chicken and corn bread dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Then pro football, which had made sporadic and unsuccessful visits, came back. 
And stayed. The NFL's Cowboys began playing in Dallas in 1960, as did the AFL's 
Oilers in Houston. Suddenly SMU, TCU, Houston and Rice found themselves in 
direct competition with the emerging TV darling, pro football. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have time and we have money and it's how we spend the two that determines 
things," said Fred Jacoby, SWC commissioner from 1982-93. 
</P>
<P>
 The SWC began to see an erosion of some of its fan support and income. It was 
subtle at first, but it was also irreversible, especially when major league 
baseball, the NBA and, years later, the NHL were granted franchises in SWC 
strongholds such as Dallas and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 People had time and money, but they didn't have time and money for both the 
SWC and, say, the NFL. Someone had to take a hit. Guess who? DOMINO NO. 2 
</P>
<P>
 HATE THY BROTHER 
</P>
<P>
 Nine teams . . . eight of them located deep in the heart of Texas. There 
wasn't -- and still isn't -- another conference like it, where county lines and 
city limits determined such fierce allegiances, where four private schools -- 
Rice, SMU, TCU and Baylor -- mingled with four state universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at a map. Texas A&M is 80 miles from Texas and Baylor, 90 miles from 
Houston and Rice, 155 miles from TCU and SMU. The football claustrophobia led 
to rivalries that escalated into mini-wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's that complicated," said Hatchell, who did what he could to 
rescue the league before running out of time. "I think the eight schools in one 
state really hurt. The focus wasn't one of change, the focus was tearing into 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 There was pride at stake. No self-respecting Aggie wanted to be outdone by a 
Texas Longhorn. No SMU grad wanted to see the Horned Frogs steal the headlines. 
Corners were cut. Rules were broken. Recruiting became a sacred mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told by people who have been around this area for a long time that 
when college recruiting became cutthroat, sometime in the '60s, that's when we 
lost some friendships and loyalties," said Bill Lively, SMU's interim athletic 
director. "I think he's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse was the absence of any central authority. The SWC didn't 
have a full-time commissioner (then known as an executive secretary) until 
1945, 30 years after the conference was formed. James Stewart held the position 
until 1950 and then was succeeded by Howard Grubbs. Grubbs was followed in 1973 
by Cliff Speegle, who was followed in 1982 by Jacoby, who was succeeded by 
Hatchell. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, Stewart, Grubbs and Speegle were caretakers. They 
couldn't or wouldn't stop the back-stabbing so prevalent in the 
ultra-competitive league. Even Jacoby's tenure was held to a penetrating light. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time things just rocked along," said Texas A&M Coach R.C. Slocum. 
"I didn't see us taking a strong leadership role at the conference office 
level. In (the Big Eight and Pacific 10) those leagues always have had very 
strong conference offices." DOMINO NO. 3 
</P>
<P>
 SCANDAL 
</P>
<P>
 The recruiting wars reached their zenith and the SWC reached its nadir from 
1983-88, the days of scandal and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Free enterprise was alive and well as high school stars made their back-room 
deals with assorted SWC alumni and boosters. Some of the deals were made with 
the knowledge and blessings of the coaches, who watched either happily or 
helplessly as the cheating reached almost comical proportions. In some cases, 
players weren't recruited as much as auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby was there when the explosion blew the situation out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pervasive at that time," he said. "It was plugging the dam every place 
you could." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the leaks were contained, SMU's program had received the NCAA's 
death penalty. TCU was on probation. Texas, Baylor, Houston, Texas A&M and 
Texas Tech all eventually were found guilty of violating major or minor NCAA 
rules. It was a public relations apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the penalties and trickle-down effects: fewer TV appearances and less TV 
revenue, fewer bowl appearances, one fewer program -- SMU's -- to generate 
income for the conference, reduced attendance and, of course, the Exodus. 
DOMINO NO. 4 
</P>
<P>
 SEE YOU LATER 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of sanctions against SWC programs increased, so did the number 
of out-of-state recruiters venturing into the region for players. Texas always 
had been a fertile place for high school talent, but rarely did a player cross 
state lines. If he did, it was usually to Oklahoma or Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scandals created an atmosphere where the out-of-state schools could come 
in and paint a bleak picture of the league," said Slocum. "And the schools here 
just kept hammering each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruits left the state in droves, to Nebraska, Colorado, Michigan, Florida 
State, Miami, Notre Dame and UCLA, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really disappointing," said Slocum. "Once the perception was out there 
. . . kids were led to believe that the best thing to do was to get out of 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult breaking that perception. In the last five, seven, 
eight years the No. 1 thing I've had to do in the (recruit's) home was defend 
the Southwest Conference. Most of the other coaches in the country don't have 
to do that. The Pac-10 doesn't have to defend the league. The Big Eight 
doesn't. But the No. 1 thing I had to do was go in there and convince them that 
we were playing in a good conference." DOMINO NO. 5 
</P>
<P>
 THE COTTON BOWL

 Turn on the Rose Bowl telecast and you see sun. Fiesta Bowl . . . sun. Orange 
Bowl . . . moon over warm Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn on the Cotton Bowl, you often see heaters on the sideline. Players 
wearing mittens. Rain. Cold. Misery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Cotton Bowl hurt the league," said a high-ranking SWC official 
who requested anonymity. "Up through the mid-70s, the Cotton Bowl was a big 
deal. Now it isn't. Here's the Cotton Bowl, in the cold of Dallas -- that hurt 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 So did a string of poor luck. The Cotton Bowl hasn't had a national 
championship game since 1977, when fifth-ranked Notre Dame defeated top-ranked 
Texas. DOMINO NO. 6 
</P>
<P>
 NOTRE DAME GOES ITS WAY 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 64 members of the once powerful College Football Assn., none was more 
valued than Notre Dame, the great football cash cow. But on Feb. 5, 1990, Notre 
Dame announced it was leaving the CFA to make its own deal with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 According to terms of the agreement, NBC would retain exclusive rights for 
telecasts of Irish home games from 1991-95 (later extended through 2000). Notre 
Dame would get $38 million for the first five years and a comparably generous 
figure for the extension, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's sudden departure, along with a Federal Trade Commission 
investigation into possible CFA antitrust violations, forced conferences to 
reassess their television marketability. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Notre Dame pulled out of the CFA package, that was kind of the first 
step of what happened to the breakup of the CFA . . . and this conference," 
said TCU's Windegger. "The needy and the greedy, that's what the NCAA has 
turned into." DOMINO NO. 7 
</P>
<P>
 BROYLES PULLS THE PLUG 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas, an original member of the SWC and a 13-time conference champion, 
defected in 1990 and joined the Southeastern Conference in time for the 1992 
season. Orchestrating the move was Athletic Director Frank Broyles, who had 
coached Arkansas to seven of those titles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the time it took for the Arkansas Board of Trustees to cast their historic 
vote on Aug. 1, 1990, the SWC lost one of its highest-profile members, to say 
nothing of a consistent money maker. Arkansas won games, drew well, got on 
television, went to bowl games and put cash in the conference account. Now the 
Razorbacks were gone, leaving Jacoby to wonder what if. 
</P>
<P>
 "From July 1990, I tried to encourage the conference to expand," he said. "The 
(SWC) presidents said not to talk to any schools in (other) conferences. What 
you're left to select from are schools up and down the Mississippi River." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby said he pushed to invite Memphis and Louisville. Both schools had 
nationally recognized basketball programs and emerging football programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was blocked every time I tried to make a move," Jacoby said. "That 
really hurt us because we had a chance to expand. Both of those programs were 
in the top 40 TV markets." 
</P>
<P>
 As the SWC stood still, the SEC added Arkansas and South Carolina. Penn State 
went to the Big Ten. Other leagues began to position themselves for the 
inevitable Big Bang. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the SWC had become confined to the state of Texas. It was a 
geographical hostage and it was the league's own fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "The departure of Arkansas opened the door," said SMU's Lively. "Somebody had 
to do that first, and Arkansas was the one." DOMINO NO. 8 
</P>
<P>
 THE RUMORS 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas was the first, but supposedly not the last SWC member interested in 
bolting. Texas was interested in the Pac-10, Texas A&M was interested in the 
SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Those schools wanted out because they were upset with the prospects for the 
SWC's future. Attendance was spotty at Rice, SMU, TCU and Houston. Facilities 
were lacking. Revenue sharing remained a sore point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a bad deal for everyone," Slocum said. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Texas and Texas A&M, the two marquee names, felt they were doing all 
the heavy financial lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Not true, said Jacoby. The former SWC commissioner said revenue distribution 
in the conference was adjusted so that the Aggies and Longhorns, who drew large 
home crowds, would retain a higher percentage of their gate receipts. The 
formula to distribute TV money also was adjusted in favor of Texas and Texas 
A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to reward them," Jacoby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wacker remembers the mess. The former TCU coach, who now is at Minnesota, 
was appalled by the greed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happened with Arkansas, Texas and Texas A&M," he said. "They kept 
demanding more and more and more of the money. Their stick kept getting bigger 
and bigger and everyone else's stick kept getting smaller and smaller. It 
ultimately tore (the conference) apart." 
</P>
<P>
 And don't mention the Texas and Texas A&M concerns to Windegger of TCU. He 
remembers a different era, with different haves and have nots. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were days when the SMUs, Rices and TCUs of the world were carrying 
Texas and A&M, too," he said. "A&M is the one on probation. They just can't 
point at SMU." DOMINO NO. 9 
</P>
<P>
 THE ONE-TWO PUNCH 
</P>
<P>
 Enacted in 1972, Title IX legislation ordered, among other things, that 
schools receiving federal funds couldn't discriminate on the basis of gender. 
From Title IX came an increase in the number of varsity athletic programs 
available for women. Years later came gender equity. And from gender equity 
came the realization that equality costs lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Title IX is the law," said Grant Teaff, a former Baylor coach and athletic 
director who once served on the NCAA's gender equity task force. "Gender equity 
is somewhere above the law, depending on whose agenda you are looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 For the SWC, the agenda was simple: Obey the law. 
</P>
<P>
 So conference members began adding more women's sports and scholarships, at 
the same time adding strain on their operating budgets. Someone had to pay the 
bills, which was why athletic directors tried to squeeze more money out of 
football, one of the few sports capable of producing the revenue to bankroll 
the other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As dollars became more precious, the pressure to produce winning, profitable 
football programs became more acute. Victories meant higher attendance, more TV 
appearance fees, more bowl income and increased alumni donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses got you red ink. And sometimes a pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
 Something had to give. In the end, it was the SWC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Soviet Union," said Houston Athletic Director Bill Carr. "The 
ultimate reason for change was not simply ideology, it was economics. When the 
numbers don't work, things change." DOMINO NO. 10 
</P>
<P>
 BLACK ROCK LOSES THE NFL 
</P>
<P>
 The New York offices of CBS are known as "Black Rock." If Windegger had been 
there the day the Fox network outbid CBS for the rights to the NFC, he might 
have jumped from a window. 
</P>
<P>
 "When CBS lost NFL football, I took a big gulp that day," he said. "When they 
lost that, that left CBS with a lot of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jacoby: "A black day in college athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 Desperately in need of sports programming, CBS went on a buying spree. The 
network bought the rights to SEC basketball and football and later did the same 
with the Big East Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whole lot of shaking and baking," said Windegger. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, the CFA was dead. It was every conference for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big Eight and the Western Athletic 
Conference signed with ABC, which already had the Pac-10 and the Big Ten. The 
SWC was left without a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jacoby, the SWC had spent nearly three years working on an 
alliance with the Big Eight. But when the CFA collapsed, people panicked -- or 
lied -- and the alliance never happened. Instead, Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor and 
Texas Tech joined the Big Eight (soon to be Big 12), while Rice, SMU and TCU 
scurried to join the WAC, all effective for the 1996-97 season. Houston has yet 
to decide on a conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It popped us like a bomb," said Windegger, whose school, along with Rice, 
SMU, and Houston weren't invited to the Big Eight. "We should have been a 
little more progressive. We could have played that game and brought in four of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Houston's Carr: "It was not a result of rational and open 
discussion. The moving vans came in the middle of the night. I don't say that 
with rancor, that's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 SMU's Lively had a different perspective. The short version: The SWC screwed 
up -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have been a bit naive," he said of the negotiations with the Big 
Eight. "We were probably naive in thinking we didn't have a problem down here. 
There were schools with an option and it was only a matter of time before they 
took it." EPILOGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have ever thought it: The SWC -- the Lame Duck League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in this state," said Slocum. "I remember watching the games as a 
little kid. I coached in this league for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great, glorious chapter, when it was a chapter. Now there's another 
chapter." 
</P>
<P>
 But you know what they say about sequels. Never as good as the original.

NEWSWIRE: DUCK DEFENDER FEDOTOV RETIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD , From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mighty Duck defenseman Anatoli Fedotov, who spent most of last season with the 
San Diego Gulls of the International Hockey League, announced his retirement 
Thursday. He has decided to return to his native Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ducks' training camp opened, Fedotov, 28, was absent. He later told 
General Manager Jack Ferreira he was considering quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedotov played only three games for the Ducks last season, but had 26 points 
(14 goals and 12 assists) in 66 games for the Gulls. He was the Ducks' 
10th-round selection in the 1993 entry draft. He also spent six seasons playing 
for Moscow Dynamo in Russia and one season playing for Moncton in the American 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are expected to make a number of roster moves today. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

GOODEN FAILS DRUG TESTS, FACES ADDITIONAL DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dwight Gooden, his Cy Young-winning days a dimming memory and his career 
already in doubt because of a drug suspension, faces additional disciplinary 
measures after again failing drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Mets said Thursday that Gooden "has committed additional 
violations of both his aftercare program and the commissioner's office drug 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner's office said that after the investigation has been 
concluded, including receipt of a report from baseball's medical adviser, a 
determination will be made regarding Gooden's status. The Mets said they will 
await the report from the commissioner's office before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden's agent, Jim Neader, said the No. 1 priority is to get Gooden's life 
straightened out, "then think about baseball after that. I personally think 
he'd like to play there again." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden voluntarily checked into the Smithers Center for treatment of cocaine 
addiction in 1987 and missed a month of the season. He has been regularly 
tested since then. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 28, he was suspended for 60 days without pay when he failed two random 
drug tests.

NEW TV DEAL GIVES NHL LEVERAGE FOR TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who last week got the league's first 
over-the-air network TV contract in 20 years, is expected to use that deal to 
try to gain concessions from the NHL Players Assn. when the sides resume labor 
talks today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman was the force behind a five-year, $155-million agreement with the Fox 
network, as well as significant sponsorship ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope these agreements give the players cause for more optimism and they 
want to buy in a little more" to his plan for the NHL's growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, acknowledged that the Fox 
contract will influence the talks. "But to what degree, I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL and its players' union have not had a collective bargaining agreement 
since last September. A lockout is anticipated if a new agreement is not 
reached before the season opens on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman advocates what he has called a "next generation" system that links 
salaries to revenues. The NHLPA has rejected several plans that restricted 
salaries and also indicated it will veto a "luxury tax" plan in which clubs 
that spent over a certain level on payrolls would pay a "tax" that would go to 
clubs that were under the limit. HELENE ELLIOTTNATIONAL HOCKEY LEAG

ST. LOUIS WILL RESUME ITS PURSUIT OF RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: STADIUM-LEASE ISSUE IS 
RESOLVED, CLEARING WAY FOR CITY TO RESUME TALKS WITH NFL TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sticky stadium-lease issue that has hindered St. Louis' efforts to land an 
NFL team was finally resolved Thursday, clearing the way for the city to resume 
negotiations with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw had broken off talks with St. Louis on Aug. 10, when 
it became apparent the city might not be able to secure use of the 
$258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium, currently under construction in St. 
Louis, for the 1995 football season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday's announcement that St. Louis beer distributor Jerry Clinton had 
conveyed his 30% share of the lease to FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium), 
the nonprofit group trying to secure a team, pushed St. Louis right back into 
the hunt for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to talk to the Rams, and I think we can put together a very 
competitive offer," St. Louis County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall said at a 
St. Louis news conference. "I think we're going to get the Rams here. I'm more 
confident than ever. The lease was the big obstacle, and now that's behind us." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw could not be reached Thursday night, but Heidi Sinclair of the Los 
Angeles Burson-Marsteller public relations firm, which has been hired to handle 
questions regarding a possible move, indicated that the news bodes well for St. 
Louis, one of three cities -- Baltimore and Hartford, Conn., are the others -- 
aggressively pursuing the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to say anything until we have a chance to take a look and see 
what has really gone on," Sinclair said. "Then we'll issue a statement (today) 
about starting up negotiations again." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis may have to take a number outside Shaw's office, though. Shaw is 
scheduled to meet today with members of the Orange County-based Save the Rams 
Task Force. And Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer and Baltimore Oriole 
owner Peter Angelos, who is heading Baltimore's efforts, are scheduled to meet 
with Shaw in Los Angeles next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, Save the Rams co-chairman, said he 
will unveil an enhanced package to the Rams that includes guarantees for the 
purchase of season tickets and luxury suites in a refurbished Anaheim Stadium 
and an offer, backed by several investors, to buy the Rams for between $150 
million and $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram owner Georgia Frontiere said she would consider selling a minority 
interest in the team but has said repeatedly that a controlling share is not 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous Save the Rams offer included a $50-million to $70-million 
renovation of Anaheim Stadium, construction of a new office and practice 
facility near the stadium, and a $50 million infusion of cash through the 
purchase of a minority interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis has guaranteed huge profits for the Rams -- the new stadium lease 
calls for an NFL team to receive all concession, in-house advertising, luxury 
suite and club seat revenue -- but until Clinton relented Thursday, all the 
city could offer was 54,000-seat Busch Stadium, which has no luxury suites or 
club seats.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY GETS EXTENSION TO RAISE ADDED BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadline for cornerback Darryl Henley to come up with an additional 
$40,000 in bail associated with his criminal case has been extended to 
Wednesday, a federal judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, indicted last year on cocaine conspiracy charges, had until today to 
come up with the additional amount to keep himself out of jail. But U.S. 
District Court Judge Gary L. Taylor granted Henley's request for a deadline 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams already have agreed to post a $2-million bond on Henley's behalf 
during the time he is traveling with the team. But Taylor raised a separate 
bond amount that applies to the time that Henley is in Southern California.

SMALL SIZE, BIG MOVES; SLIGHT STATURE DOESN'T KEEP FOOTMAN FROM GAINING GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Esperanza senior Dahrin Footman sees it, Emmitt Smith and Barry 
Sanders opened the holes. Now all he has to do is run through them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before Smith and Sanders exploded into the NFL, undersized running backs 
didn't have much to look up to. But now Footman, who stands 5 feet 8 and weighs 
185 pounds, has someone to follow every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'll watch Barry Sanders on television and then go out and try some 
of his moves in my back yard," Footman said. "Those guys have had success and 
they've been my role models. But even though I admire those guys and look up to 
them, I don't copy them. I still do my own thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Footman, a three-year starter at tailback, did his thing against Indio last 
week to the tune of 105 yards in 16 carries. He also returned a kickoff 94 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The yards might come a little tougher tonight when the Aztecs play host to No. 
2-ranked Mater Dei at 7 p.m. But Esperanza offensive assistant Rick Haulenbeck 
expects Footman will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happens against Mater Dei, Dahrin will be able to handle it," 
Haulenbeck said. "He's not the type of kid that will all of a sudden lose his 
confidence after one bad game. He's worked too hard to get where he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Haulenbeck said no one works harder than Footman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a kid in 18 years here run as hard as Dahrin in practice," 
Haulenbeck said. "He might be the best-conditioned athlete on the team. He's 
always in the weight room working out on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the hard work, there is some natural talent there too. Footman runs 
a 4.4 40-yard dash and he set a school record last by running 10.9 in the 100 
meters. He also holds the football team record in his weight class for 
squatting with a lift of 500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman's speed, strength and balance have started to attract attention. UCLA, 
California, Nebraska and Colorado have shown interest in recruiting Footman as 
a running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Lascola of the Scouting Evaluation Assn. went to Valencia High Sept. 8 to 
scout Footman for several colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has some assets people will look at," Lascola said. "He has some talent." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lascola isn't convinced Footman has enough for the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you sell the farm on him being a success in Division I?" Lascola said. 
"Probably not. I don't think he's got the physical frame to take the (Division 
I) type of pounding you get when you carry 20-25 times a game." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Pendleton, Esperanza's defensive coordinator the last 10 years, 
disagrees and says Footman's compact frame will work to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of backs that have flourished lately have been the smaller, stronger 
backs," Pendleton said. "In fact they've almost become the prototype back, 
especially in the (one-back) type of offense. They run so low to the ground 
that you really have to stay down to tackle them. You're off-balance trying to 
tackle them and they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Footman plans to do more than attract scouts, he must improve on his 
performance of last season. His rushing total fell off from 1,134 to 751 yards 
and his average gain per carry dropped from 7.2 to 4.9. Maybe not 
coincidentally, Esperanza's victory total also fell off from 12 in 1992 to 
seven in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no blocking," he said. "It was really frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton said Footman's frustrating year was beyond his control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The holes weren't there for him," Pendleton said. "People were stacking the 
line of scrimmage and the blocking wasn't good enough to overcome it. Dahrin 
would have to break two or three tackles just to gain eight or nine yards. But 
this year, the line is the best we've had in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 And Pendleton says the offensive scheme will play more to Footman's strengths 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran a Wing-T last year and that offense eventually ran its course," 
Pendleton said. "This year we have three wide receivers and we're much more 
spread out. It's great for a running back because there's so much open space to 
work with. 
</P>

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; 'CAESAR' IN PLAIN ENGLISH; TV'S JOSEPH MARCELL DIRECTS A 
SHAKESPEARE PRODUCTION FEATURING BLACK, LATINO ACTORS -- AND MINUS THE ACCENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Joseph Marcell, who plays the butler Geoffrey in the NBC sitcom "Fresh Prince 
of Bel Air," is directing a non-traditional production of Shakespeare's "Julius 
Caesar" at Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild/Alliance of Motion Picture and Television 
Producers Industry Advancement and Cooperative Fund, the production is offering 
performers of color an opportunity to showcase their Shakespearean talents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caribbean-born Marcell, a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company for more 
than 20 years, has a special reason for wanting to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "America has been very good to me," Marcell said. "And I wanted to share 
something with my fellow actors of African and Hispanic descent. It's something 
I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Santa Lucia, Marcell's family migrated to London, where he first got 
the acting bug. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending the Central School for Speech and Drama, he auditioned for the 
Royal Shakespeare Company and appeared in a production of "Julius Caesar" in 
1972. His colleagues in the company at the time included actors Patrick 
Stewart, Richard Johnson, David Warner and Ian Holm. 
</P>
<P>
 He later acted on Broadway and at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Marcell 
directed London productions of "Othello" and other plays. Just how 
non-traditional will this production at Valley College be? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's non-traditional in every aspect of the production," Marcell said. "The 
aim is about presenting the words of Shakespeare without British accents, 
without manufactured Shakespearean accents, just the words as people speak 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Julius Caesar" opens Sept. 22 and will run 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays 
and 7 p.m. Sundays at the Little Theatre at Los Angeles Valley College, 5800 
Fulton Ave., Van Nuys. Ends Oct. 9. Tickets are $10, $7 students and SAG 
members. Call (213) 658-9655.

 JOYFUL NOISE: Actress Annette Bening will perform Oct. 1 at a benefit for 
Glendale's classical theater company, A Noise Within. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser, called "A Glorious Noise Within," will feature Bening, plus 
pianist and composer Norman Henry Mamey and a program of scenes from the 
classical repertoire, performed by company members.  
</P>
<P>
 Bening's film credits include "Valmont," "Regarding Henry," "The Grifters" and 
"Bugsy." With her husband, Warren Beatty, she has recently completed two 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Their film "Love Affair," a remake of 1957's "An Affair to Remember," starring 
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, opens Oct. 14. Their son, whose name has not been 
announced, was born Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 A Noise Within's artistic director Art Manke said they are thrilled to have 
Bening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to find someone who has a common history," Manke said. "Someone 
trained in classical theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Bening was trained at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre, along 
with several other members of A Noise Within.  
</P>
<P>
 "She came by to see 'The School for Wives' last spring," Manke said. "And we 
invited her to come and perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Just exactly what she will perform has not been finalized, Manke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Glorious Noise Within" will begin at 7 p.m. Oct. 1 at the Chevy Chase 
Country Club. Tickets for the black-tie optional event are $75. Call (818) 
546-1924.

 THE SHOW GOES ON: Cal State Northridge's largest venue, the Campus Theater, is 
still closed, due to earthquake damage. Campus officials said they hope to have 
it open and operating by February, 1995. Other sections of the drama building 
have reopened but are still in need of repair. Regardless, Cal State 
Northridge's fall 1994 theater season is going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back in business; that impresses me more than anything," said Jeffrey 
Levy, CSUN's theater manager. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's theater arts department will open the season with "Cloud 9" on Oct. 14 
in the Studio Theatre, in the school's drama building. Levy describes Caryl 
Churchill's "Cloud 9" as a modern play about sexual roles and sexual 
preferences. It will run through Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart's opera "Cosi Fan Tutte," staged and conducted by music professor David 
W. Scott, will be presented in the Little Theatre on Oct. 21 through 30. A 
musical, "Once on This Island," with book and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music 
by Stephen Flaherty, will be presented as a dinner theater event Nov. 10 
through 19 in the Satellite Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medea's Children," written by Per Lys Ander and Suzanne Osten, will be 
performed Nov. 18 through Dec. 4 in the Studio Theatre. The play deals with 
divorce from a child's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 This production also will have daytime matinees scheduled for school groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, two student-guided productions that are part of an experimental 
course also will be staged.

12, 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>

will be offered in the Little Theatre from Dec. 1 through Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: CAPTURING THE LOOK; DECOR ART GALLERY EMBELLISHES A LARGE 
SELECTION OF AFFORDABLE REPRODUCTIONS USING FRAMES AND MATTING THAT APPEAR 
EXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art prints, beautifully framed and at reasonable prices. This is the premise 
of the recently opened Decor Art Gal lery in Studio City. For instant 
decorative enhancement, hundreds of prints (reproductions) and lithographs, 
ranging from current California artists to the old masters, are ready to take 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Open since May, business has been so solid, says owner Lynne Crandall, that 
she has replaced her entire inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find abstracts, florals or landscapes to decorate an entire home or 
office. Crandall's knowledge of art is apparent in the selection and her taste 
shows in the framing. 
</P>
<P>
 All framing, incidentally, is done at the Van Nuys factory, to Crandall's 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 We especially like use of the "image matting" technique, where the matting 
becomes a part of the print, giving the piece an extraordinary 
three-dimensional look that is particularly effective with landscapes. This 
generally runs approximately $50 more than regular matted pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the customer want to change a matting color or the frame, that is done 
at no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices overall range from $45 to $350. 
</P>
<P>
 At $45 each, we found two ethereal prints by Michael Parkes, a contemporary 
surrealist whose originals go for $100,000 and up. These measure 18 by 18 
inches, with a three-inch matting and gold frames. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest priced item in the gallery is a numbered lithograph by Sylvia 
Hamilton Goulden, a Studio City artist known for her figurative images. 
</P>
<P>
 Measuring 38 by 48 inches and double-matted in a lacquer frame, the price is 
$350. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kiss," by turn-of-the century Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, would cover 
a lot of wall space with drama, measuring 38 inches wide by 56 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 It is double-framed with gold on the inside and an outer frame of black 
stucco. (Klimt's paintings were the inspiration for the Oscar-winning costumes 
for Francis Ford Coppola's "Dracula.") Handsome and beautifully priced at $250, 
the piece contains about $500 worth of framing alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a charming print (34 by 44 inches) of a watercolor by Howard Behrens 
depicting a quaint village in the south of France, Villefranche/Mer, you may 
select your frame for $125. 
</P>
<P>
 The display piece has a mat with an open channel cut that gives the impression 
of being triple-matted, when actually it is double. This was priced at a Los 
Angeles gallery at $175, and the framing was much less impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 A work by contemporary landscape artist Thomas McKnight measures 36 by 36 
inches, is double-matted in a two-inch frame and sells for $98, as compared to 
$150 at some galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 You will find beautifully framed reproductions by well-known artists, from Van 
Gogh to Peter Max, at this new San Fernando Valley gallery, and the prices are 
definitely right, mainly because of Crandall's talent at making the framing 
look much more expensive than it is. 
</P>
<P>
 She is available by appointment at your home or office.

FOR KIDS; SOFTWARE REVIEW; GET IN TOUCH; WITH TYPING TECHNIQUE PROGRAMS, 
CHILDREN WILL HAVE COMPUTER SAVVY AT THEIR FINGERTIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The days of penmanship class are over. Word processing is in. More and more 
children use com puter keyboards at school and at home, and teachers, as early 
as first grade, accept homework printed out from a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 In this brave new digital world, children are being taught touch-typing early. 
Although voice-command computers may eventually eliminate the need to type, we 
don't know when that will come about. Meanwhile, nobody wants the kids to hunt 
and peck. 
</P>
<P>
 Four outstanding children's typing tutors for home computer use are on the 
market. Each program has unique strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For the littlest keyboarders (ages 4 to 8), a wonderful tutor is "Kid Keys" 
(Davidson & Associates). It's built around a silly theme involving monsters 
trapped in a castle by a purple dragon. Three winsome activities entice young 
hands and minds to the keyboard. The simplest is a letter-recognition game in 
which an on-screen keyboard hides a variety of animated characters. Press the 
letter and a voice recites it while a little cartoon illustrates the sound ("V 
is for volcano" -- and a volcano erupts on screen). Each letter has a few 
animations so kids don't get bored. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second "Kid Keys" activity, children practice typing by playing tunes 
on the keyboard. The third, most demanding game challenges kids to touch-type 
to help four comical characters get out of jail. "Kid Keys" is carefully 
calibrated to introduce touch-typing in gradual stages. It makes jolly work out 
of learning a dull skill, a not inconsiderable feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mario Teaches Typing" (Interplay Productions) isn't as conceptually winsome 
as "Kid Keys," but it does weigh in heavily in the brand-name recognition 
department. Anyone whose child is addicted to a Mario video game will have a 
walk on the beach getting the child to fool around with this game. It's a lot 
like video-game play -- bouncing and popping along, this time bopping letters 
instead of objects. The challenge lies in making sure that your child uses the 
correct fingers on the keyboard (on-screen gloves show the right move for every 
keystroke). Unmonitored, a kid will just try to go fast and ignore the tutoring 
aspect of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four graduated levels to "Mario Teaches Typing." Adjustable features 
let you set up practice so that your child gradually builds the skills involved 
in touch-typing. Certificates and special screens reward the player for meeting 
words-per-minute goals as well as completing levels. Although "Mario Teaches 
Typing" can't be used for letter recognition, it will take a child all the way 
through to touch-typing at 50 words per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 7- to 10-year-old set, "Kids' Typing" (Bright Star) is a witty, 
sophisticated typing tutor, particularly apt for the wisenheimer in your 
family. It's got a sly, tongue-in-cheek story line about a ghost named Spooky 
who's taken up residence in the attic of a suburban home. Spooky is your typing 
tutor, and if you do well at his lessons, he lets you infiltrate the house with 
him and haunt its inhabitants. You can go into the den and levitate the 
television while Dad watches sports (the sports-casting background noise is 
witty and the faster you type, the higher the TV goes; Dad, in his couch-potato 
mode, remains oblivious). Or you can run the blender in Mom's kitchen, 
eavesdrop while Sis trades inanities on the phone in her bedroom or play 
musical instruments in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 If you get tired of Spooky's lessons, you can visit a library. There, a 
bookcase full of children's literature from "Cinderella" to "Rumpelstiltskin" 
lets you practice typing using real text (always more fun than "doing scales"). 
Also, you can explore a 26-book "encyclopedia" set in which each book focuses 
on giving practice with a single letter of the alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 The screens are gorgeous and the monitoring features excellent (Spooky can 
even tell you which keys you are best and worst at hitting correctly). This is 
a powerful program whose economical price shouldn't be taken as a reflection on 
its quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-time best-selling classic of touch-typing software is a program called 
"Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing!" It's not designed for kids, although a child 
over 10 can certainly benefit from it. The news here is that the producers are 
coming out with a kids' version this summer called "Mavis Beacon's Adventures: 
Typing for Kids" (The Software Toolworks). 
</P>
<P>
 Designed for the 4- to 8-year-old market, it has six activities that include 
letter recognition, word recognition and typing activities. Although the 
software wasn't ready for review before deadline, I've seen samples of how it 
looks. It's eye candy, waggish and fun. Fully animated and with the depth of 
the adult version (which is by far the most comprehensive typing tutor I've 
experienced), this could end up being the best buy of all for the preschool to 
second-grade crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings up the question: Why should 4-year-olds -- who don't know how to 
spell or read -- learn to type? 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say there's nothing premature about learning the keyboard at 4. With 
the right computer program, letter recognition becomes part of the fun leading 
to keyboard comfort. As children move into the world of spelling and reading, 
it can only thrill them to know that these magical new tools called "words" are 
at their fingertips. They're sitting inside their home computers, waiting to be 
tapped out. Prices and Platforms 03,28,08,26 Title Price Platform Kid Keys

CLUB SCENE; WEEKEND WINDUP AT THE SAGEBRUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The end of a too-short weekend and the thought of a new workweek is enough to 
send some people to bed early on Sundays. But some have a different view. 
Located in Calabasas, the Sagebrush Cantina offers all-day live entertainment, 
food and drink every Sunday, making the day of rest a not-so-restful day. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: With its Western decor and flavor, the Sagebrush is what Knott's 
Berry Farm would be if it were a bar instead of a theme park. The main 
attraction for the over-21 crowd is the cocktail patio, a huge seating area 
that serves alcohol and appetizers. The restaurant has a large bar and two 
dining areas serving full menus of Mexican and barbecue meals. There are no 
rides in this miniature land, but there is plenty of atmosphere and many 
interesting subjects in the petting zoo -- er, patio. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: "It's a great place to people watch. There are many exotic and 
erotic people here," said Nancy Lampert, 32, of Westlake Village. The crowd is 
eclectic, with many people coming to see and be seen. Lots of skin of the 
tanned and tattooed variety is on display here, with fashions favoring halter 
tops and short skirts on the women and muscle T-shirts and jeans on the men. A 
large part of the parking lot is reserved for showpiece motorcycles, which seem 
to be the vehicles of choice for a lot of these patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Entertaining the crowd with laid-back classic rock on a recent 
Sunday evening was the Jay Bolan Trio, a band that has performed at the club 
off and on for eight years. A mariachi band performs for the brunch crowd 
Sundays and other bands play at various times in the afternoon. Still, not 
everyone's a fan. "They should have different music," said Debra Jones, 23, of 
Thousand Oaks. "Maybe jazz or something uppity like that. They always play the 
'70s rock type of music." 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Most of the patrons agree that the Sagebrush is a great place to 
socialize. "I come here for the women," said 32-year-old Greg McComish, of 
Thousand Oaks, jokingly. "No, really, to people watch and have some beers. It's 
a gathering place of diverse people with common interests: drinking, meeting 
the opposite sex and having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: The strict division of seating areas is almost militaristic. Large, 
muscular men guard the entryways between the restaurant and the cocktail area, 
policing patrons without the requisite wristband or hand stamp. And there's

<P>
 Every last one of my friends seemed puzzled when I mentioned that my 
restaurant for the week would be Koko's. I hadn't told them that this is not 
the well-known breakfast chain -- Coco's. So sue me. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking rather about a tiny Van Nuys storefront, a cafe specializing in 
tantalizing, robust Armenian fare. A reviewer needs a bit of luck to stumble 
onto a find like this. I was actually in a line to buy hot lahmajune (a sort of 
Armenian pizza topped with minced lamb, tomato sauce and spices) fresh out of 
the oven at Avo's, an Armenian bakery in Reseda, when I got an equally hot tip 
about this unassuming restaurant from a fellow standee. 
</P>
<P>
 By any standards, this is a modest place -- maybe half a dozen tables with 
pink tablecloths, a deli case stuffed with fresh fish, Armenian cheese and 
homemade sausages, an open kitchen with a kebab-crowded grill. You'll see 
chef-owner Koko Ghadanian the moment you walk through the front door, but it's 
doubtful you'll talk with him. His wife Narine does most of the welcoming and 
serving, while Koko busies himself at the grill. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't come here if you're in a hurry. Koko's always seems to be swamped 
with takeout orders, due to general lack of grill space. While you're waiting 
your turn, take comfort in a few of the chef's homemade appetizers, accompanied 
(like the entrees) by crisp wedges of warm pita bread and small dishes of 
pickled turnip and forest-green hot peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're new to Armenian cooking but familiar with Middle Eastern fare, 
you'll certainly recognize some of the appetizers. Mutabbal-baba ghannouj is a 
dip based on barbecued eggplant and sesame paste -- a first cousin to hummus. A 
river runs through it -- well, a streak, really, of paprika and flavorful olive 
oil. Koko's muhammara is a different sort of dip, a thick, savory paste 
flavored with mashed walnuts, garlic, olive oil and enough pomegranate juice to 
tie-dye a Lakers T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 If you hanker for something grilled, the barbecued quail -- at $4 a bird, 
probably the San Fernando Valley's most inexpensive quail dish -- is not to be 
missed. Seekers of the outre can order lamb tongue so tender you can cut it 
with your fork. It's extremely lemony, but the really sour entree is ras nana , 
more or less well-browned hamburger in a verdant pool of lemon juice, fresh 
mint and chopped parsley.  
</P>
<P>
 Like other Near Eastern cuisines, Armenian includes a lot of kebabs served 
with fluffy, buttery rice pilaf. Lule kebab is minced meat, spiced and dosed 
with minced onions, formed on the skewer into a sort of skinless sausage. The 
terrific chicken kebab, called shish tavuk , is mildly spiced, juicy and 
tender. As an entree it's served with rice, but there's a wonderful pita 
sandwich of shish tavuk with lettuce, tomato and a little sesame sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Arayes maria is a good value. It's a heartily spiced patty of ground meat and 
pine nuts stuffed into a crackling-hot pita. The kitchen cuts this sandwich 
into quadrants, and it could serve two as a snack. You can also get a pita 
sandwich of sujuk , a mouth-watering homemade sausage redolent of aromatic 
spices and garlic, for only $3.50. For the same price you can get a similar 
sandwich made with basturma , which isn't for amateurs. Basturma is thin-sliced 
dry-cured beef, and it has a powerful peppery kick.  
</P>
<P>
 There is also fresh fish on the menu, at a rather steeper price. When Narine 
couldn't tell us the English names for most of the fish, we chose the one she 
could, sea bass. We probably should have guessed that a sea bass, large enough 
for three, would run $20, which is about three times the typical entree price 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you order, don't fail to get a side dish of Koko's jajik , the 
coolest, creamiest, most refreshing yogurt dip I've yet tasted. It's thick, 
creamy yogurt full of cucumber and mint, with a soft kiss of garlic.  
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, there might be a flavored custard called ashia or baklava from a 
commercial bakery. The Armenian way to wash down a pastry is with a muddy cup 
of Armenian coffee ( soorj ) in a demitasse. It might not be apple pie and 
java, but it'll do just fine, thank you. Where and When 
</P>

SANITARY DISTRICTS MANAGER WILL RETIRE AMID INQUIRES; MANAGEMENT: SAFETY AND 
CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED. SEVERAL ON BOARD PRAISE 
OFFICIAL'S RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The general manager of the Orange County Sanitation Districts has announced 
his retirement amid state and local probes into alleged safety violations at 
the agency and accusations of office mismanagement, a district spokesman 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Wayne Sylvester, who is the target of a district attorney's investigation 
into conflict-of-interest issues, informed the board of directors during an 
executive session Wednesday night that he will step down Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the agency's board of directors praised Sylvester's 35 
years of service and said much of the turmoil surrounding the districts is not 
his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally am not surprised that he is retiring," said board member Barry 
J. Hammond, who is also an Irvine councilman. "I think Wayne has served the 
district well for many, many years. . . . I think some of the recent media 
scrutiny has provided a little motivation for him to let someone else take 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation agency is made up of nine separate districts in the county and 
provides sewer collection, treatment and disposal services for more than 2 
million Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page letter to the board, Sylvester cited undisclosed personal 
reasons for his decision to retire. "Quite frankly, I'm burned out," he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 He thanked the board and the districts' staff for their support in making the 
districts "the leading waste-water management agency in the country."  
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester's tenure as general manager has come under fire this past year with 
accusations that the districts are poorly managed and have lost millions of 
dollars because of project cost overruns and legal expenses incurred from 
defending the districts against a number of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the districts became the target of state and local 
investigations into a fire at a Huntington Beach plant that killed two workers. 
Cal/OSHA, the state's occupational safety and health agency, cited the district 
for safety violations in the Feb. 1 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is continuing an investigation 
into the fire to determine whether criminal charges should be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the district attorney is looking into alleged 
conflict-of-interest violations against Sylvester, Deputy Dist. Atty. Matt 
Anderson said. Sylvester may have violated state ethics laws by accepting more 
than $250 worth of gifts from developers doing business with the districts, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of some of the scrutiny of Sylvester and the districts, the 
42-member board of directors commissioned a private firm to conduct a 
management analysis of the districts. In a preliminary report released in July, 
the consultants made 16 recommendations to improve management of district 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester was unavailable for comment Thursday, but he defended his record in 
his letter to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recent years we have received close to 50 awards of excellence, including 
pollution prevention, source control and cutting edge technological efforts, 
culminating last year in being named the number one (waste-water agency) in the 
nation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency," Sylvester wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised to assist "in any way . . . to assure a smooth management 
transition." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors will be responsible for finding Sylvester's 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 John C. Cox, joint-chairman of the board and a Newport Beach councilman, said 
Sylvester "has done an absolutely outstanding job over the past 35 years in 
every aspect of the districts' operations. Wayne's leadership and knowledge 
have been recognized by his peers nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Mayor John Collins, another board member, said he was hoping 
that Sylvester would stay with the districts until the private management 
review was completed. He said the districts will be trying to reorganize to 
improve operations as a result of the management reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expecting to get some good recommendations and I think we could use 
Wayne's wealth of experience in trying to implement them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Collins said some of the recent criticism of the districts "unfortunately got 
personalized . . . I think (Sylvester) took it personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler, another board member, said he thought 
Sylvester "has done a good job and is very efficient and businesslike. With all 
of the problems recently, maybe he figures it's time to retire and get on with 
the things he likes to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler added that the allegations against Sylvester and the districts are 
"blown out of proportion. . . . I have seen nothing shady with Wayne. He is a 
good man."

THIEF FACES LIFE TERM UNDER '3 STRIKES' LAW; CRIME: THE COUNTY'S FIRST 
DEFENDANT CONVICTED UNDER THE LAW WILL BE IN PRISON FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS FOR 
HIS THIRD FELONY, STEALING A BMW. HE SAYS HE SUPPORTS THE LEGISLATION, BUT ONLY 
FOR VIOLENT CRIMINALS.

<P>
 As Orange County's first defendant convicted under California's "three 
strikes" law, Thomas G. Cargill faces the same sentence as a murderer. But 
Cargill's crime was stealing a BMW convertible from a used car lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe this, I'm in shock," Cargill, 35, said Thursday during 
an interview at the Central Men's Jail.  
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated just over an hour Wednesday before 
convicting the Huntington Beach man of stealing the car. It was Cargill's third 
felony conviction, which means he is now eligible for a prison term of 25 years 
to life when he is sentenced Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit it, I started to cry when the jury came back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Larry Bruce questioned the cost of keeping someone such as 
Cargill in prison for at least 20 years -- the time he must serve before 
becoming eligible for parole. Before the new law, Cargill would have faced a 
maximum of six years in prison, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Corrections officials estimate it costs an average of 
$20,760 to house an inmate for one year -- or at least $420,000 to keep Cargill 
in prison until 2014. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I did something wrong, send me to prison," Cargill said. "But I just can't 
believe I deserve 25 years to life in prison for this." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Scotland, Cargill grew up in Huntington Beach, surrounded by a 
loving, comfortable family. He toyed with business ventures but says he also 
dabbled in property crimes, mainly to see what he could get away with. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded his prior two convictions on burglary charges and a history of car 
thefts have finally caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cargill said he is innocent of the current charges against him, but said he 
knows his background will remind people of the "little boy who cried wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 Cargill, however, said he believes he received a fair trial and even said he 
fully supports the "three strikes" legislation -- but only when it is applied 
to violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed the legislation in March following public outrage that 
Richard Allen Davis, the man accused of killing of 12-year-old Polly Klaas in 
Petaluma, had a lengthy criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law tallies up strikes for each violent or serious felony -- ranging 
from burglary to murder. A defendant strikes out with a third felony -- any 
felony -- whether it's drug possession or petty theft with a prior conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not downplaying the seriousness of the crimes I've been accused and 
convicted of, but I believe this law was aimed at guys like Davis," Cargill 
said. "I just don't think I fall into that category." 
</P>
<P>
 Cargill said he has been trying not to dwell on the future or his past, but 
the possibility of life in prison keeps haunting him. It hit him again Thursday 
morning as he was reading People magazine in his cell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just suddenly hit me," he said. "I'm reading about stuff that's outside, 
things I might never take part of again." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas scheduled a sentencing 
hearing Nov. 3. He must first determine whether Cargill's prior convictions -- 
as alleged by prosecutors -- are valid, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Sauer. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does find them valid, "it's my understanding of the law that his hands 
are tied, the judge must sentence him to 25 years to life," Sauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce said he is hoping for -- but not confident of -- a last-minute reprieve 
for his client. "I believe the courts have an inherent power to make the 
punishment fit the crime, but I'm not sure what can be done in this case," 
Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce said the case went to trial because his client contended he was 
innocent, but also because there was nothing to lose by doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Orange County's legal community believe the court system could be 
clogged with "three strike" defendants demanding trials, while many judges say 
they are prepared to do whatever it takes to process the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Cargill said his conviction has made many inmates in jail sit up and take 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this, guys accused of a lot worse were all saying 'Oh, they'll change 
the law, don't worry, they'll never do it,' " Cargill said. "Now, they're 
looking at me and going, 'Uh, oh.' "

AUNT CHARGED WITH TORTURE OF 10-YEAR-OLD; CRIME: BOY SUFFERS SEVERE INJURIES TO 
RECTUM AND HAS TONGUE BURNED. PROSECUTOR CITES 'EGREGIOUS' NATURE OF THE ABUSE 
FOR UNPRECEDENTED CHARGE. WOMAN'S HUSBAND IS ALSO INVESTIGATED.

<P>
 A 10-year-old boy has been tortured so badly -- including having his tongue 
burned by a hot knife -- that he nearly died, according to authorities who 
arrested his 31-year-old aunt and filed criminal torture charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so egregious, it's hard to begin to describe it or imagine it," Lt. 
Timm Browne of the Orange Police Department said Thursday. "It's truly 
chilling." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office Thursday filed one charge of torture and four 
counts of corporeal punishment against Cynthia Medina, who turned herself in to 
police around 8 a.m. Thursday, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case marks the first time torture charges have been filed in connection 
with a child abuse case, according to Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said Medina is suspected of searing the boy's tongue with a hot knife 
and penetrating him anally with a souvenir baseball bat on Sept. 7. The boy, 
whose name wasn't released because of his age, also suffered welts and bruises, 
possibly inflicted by an electrical extension cord, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's injuries were so severe that doctors at Children's Hospital of 
Orange County surgically implanted a colostomy bag on the boy's abdomen last 
week, said Sgt. Dave Jensen of the Orange police. The boy was listed in stable 
condition at CHOC late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors tell us that if the child hadn't been brought to the hospital within 
30 minutes of when we had, the boy very well could have passed away," Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police learned about the alleged abuse on Sept. 8 from a family doctor to whom 
Medina had taken the boy, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina and her husband, Edward, were arrested that day by Orange police and 
were jailed for 72 hours, said Browne. Police released the couple on Tuesday 
because of insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating Edward Medina but have not made an arrest, Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, this had been going for some time," said Browne. "I don't think 
this 10-year-old kid has had many happy days in his short 10 years of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina apparently has been the boy's guardian since infancy, police 
said. The Medinas' biological son, who is 9, was placed by county authorities 
in Orangewood Children's Home on Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Medina was employed by the Orange Unified School District as a 
playground supervisor at Sycamore Elementary School, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police said they have no previous abuse complaints about the Medinas. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Cynthia Medina could face life imprisonment, according to 
Jensen.

 FULLERTON

<P>
 Program Helps Boost Teachers' Confidence 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty teachers are doing some studying of their own. The beginning secondary 
teachers are participating in a new self-confidence building program that began 
this fall at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Project START (Support and Training to Achieve Retention of Teachers) involves 
improving beginning teachers' skills, knowledge and abilities, and encourages 
teachers to stay in the profession, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers participating are from six high schools in the Fullerton Joint 
Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education awarded the district a $217,261 grant for 
the one-year program. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant pays for a Cal State Fullerton professor, tuition and book costs for 
the teachers. A coach assigned to each teacher observes them in their classes 
and helps them plan and evaluate lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university and the (high school) district are working together to help 
our teachers be the best that they can be," Project START director Lynda E. 
Randall said in a press release.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; LAW FIRMS ENTER CARGO FLIGHT FIGHT

<P>
 The City Council has agreed to spend $10,000 to retain two law firms that 
specialize in airport issues to represent the city in its efforts to prevent 
cargo flights out of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Two air freight carriers, United Parcel Service and Federal Express, have 
asked Orange County to let them run one flight each per day from JWA to their 
sorting centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay $5,000 each to the firm of Stansfield and Cutler and to the 
law offices of McDermott, Will and Emery to evaluate a county environmental 
impact report on the effects of allowing the cargo flights and recommend a 
course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials fear that allowing the cargo flights would open the door to 
legal action that would gut a hard-won 1985 settlement agreement in a lawsuit 
over noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that agreement and a 1990 county Access Plan, no more than 73 
noise-regulated aircraft may depart from the airport each day. All of those are 
allotted to passenger carriers, in part because of a provision in the plan 
giving preference to aircraft with 75 or more seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The county proposed the alternative of adding two noise-controlled flights for 
cargo carriers and routing them through El Toro Marine Corps Air Station if the 
FAA would allow it. However, the county later rejected that option because 
federal regulations prohibit commercial use of military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said he believes that only applies to 
passenger carriers, not freighters. He also said it would probably be the best 
alternative for Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county approves the cargo operations at John Wayne, Newport Beach 
officials fear that two of the 73 flight slots will be switched to cargo use. 
That could prompt passenger airlines to sue to get their flights back, 
officials fear.HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY ASKS U.S. TO CONSIDER LAND SWAP TO 
SAVE WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week agreed to send a letter to Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt asking him to consider swapping federal land for the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people would like to see the whole area saved and a land swap 
could potentially be the mechanism for it," said Councilman David Sullivan, who 
suggested the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action endorsed a concept first floated in May by the Bolsa 
Chica Land Trust, a group opposed to any development on the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting in Portland with a representative of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, members of the environmental organization -- with the service's 
backing -- suggested swapping the wetlands for parts of the Tustin or El Toro 
Marine Corps air stations, both of which are scheduled for imminent closure. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Tustin task force rejected the idea last year. And recent discussions 
regarding El Toro have centered on land owned by the Irvine Co. near the 
Cleveland National Forest, not the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to deal with reality," said Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the 
Koll Real Estate Group, which proposes building 4,286 homes on the bluffs and 
lowlands and restoring 1,100 acres of wetlands. "If somebody has something real 
to present, we will look at it, but I never get anything real." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 to send the letter, over the objections of Councilmen 
Jim Silva and Earle Robitaille, who called the action "laughable" and a "total 
waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of land swap, Robitaille said, is a "bureaucratic strangulation by 
environmental groups trying to steal property without paying fair market value 
for it." DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; MISSING SISTER HAS PUT GIRL IN SPOTLIGHT

<P>
 Mahsa Ghalandar is used to being her parents' link to the English-speaking 
world. The 11-year-old has done it for most of the 15 months since her family 
moved from Tehran to Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 But since her sister, 20-year-old Mahtab Ghalandar, disappeared Sept. 6 from a 
bus stop across the street from Fullerton College, that already difficult role 
has added to her strain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think someone has her. I can't believe she's gone," Mahsa said. "Somebody 
took her because she knows her." 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia Police Detective Corinne Loomis, who is investigating the 
disappearance, said it is unlikely that Mahtab Ghalandar was taken by force in 
a crowded area in broad daylight, but police have no leads. "If you're the only 
one that (speaks the language), you're going to be the family spokesman. But 
the subject matter (now) is very, very different," Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahsa's school principal, Randi Trontz, said it's a burden for any child to be 
thrust to the forefront by a parental language barrier. "I think it's very 
stressful for a student who is dealing in the adult world. It's very difficult 
to translate for her parents in a parent-teacher conference or in any 
situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahsa, who is a sixth-grader, feels the weight but betrays little. "It's so 
hard. I can't explain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has grown accustomed to television cameras and attention. She holds back 
tears because schoolmates laughed at her when they saw her cry. Trontz says she 
keeps a poker face at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahsa recalls her sister matter-of-factly. "She's nine years older than me, 
but she never yelled at me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the child behind the adult facade shows through. As if her own prayers 
are not enough, she says: "I'd like somebody to pray for my sister." HOLLY J.

<P>
 The school year has barely started, and Fullerton School District officials 
have received numerous gifts of money and goods for district employees and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the donations received this week were a set of encyclopedias valued at 
$200, $1,200 for an air-conditioning fund, about 7,000 note pads, a school sign 
valued at $2,880, computer equipment valued at $1,800 and $600 worth of 
stick-on note pads. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, all Raymond Elementary School students -- more than 600 -- 
received new backpacks stuffed with notebooks, pencils, markers, paper, crayons 
and glue sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 The backpacks were donated by the local Staples store. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Pearl, a former Fullerton resident who recently moved out of state, 
donated the encyclopedias for Golden Hill Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckman Instruments Inc., James and Gloria Hill and Yokohama Tire Corp. 
contributed the money for the air conditioning for Pacific Drive Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parks Junior High School's Parent Teacher Student Assn. and the student 
council bought the sign for their school. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer equipment came from the Orange County-Los Angeles County 
Technology Consortium, and Day Runner Inc. gave the district the 7,000 note 
pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, donations for the district's schools totaled more than $100,000, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If donors continue to contribute as they have so far this year, donations are 
expected to top that amount by the end of the school year, school board 
President Robert C. Fisler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that people give to our schools," he said. "It proves that 
there's money there if you have a good cause, and I think we have the best 
cause on earth: education." MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL DELAYS SPAN FOR SHOPPING CENTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A divided City Council this week voted to keep two shopping centers divided 
for the time being. It granted an Irvine Co. request to postpone construction 
of a footbridge across the San Diego Creek linking the Crossroads and Westpark 
Plaza shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. officials and major retailers successfully argued that the bridge 
could increase their cost of doing business and compound parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 3 to 2 to grant a zoning change to the Irvine Co., 
delaying construction of the bridge until a transit station is built at the 
site for the planned countywide monorail system. Rick Evans, president of the 
Irvine Co.'s Retail Properties Group, agreed to post a 15-year, $200,000 bond 
for construction of the bridge, to be adjusted annually for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the bridge was a zoning requirement for the Irvine Co.'s 
development of Westpark Village. Councilwomen Christina L. Shea and Paula 
Werner voted against delaying construction of the bridge, arguing that it would 
benefit most nearby residents. They also voiced concerns about the precedent 
set by changing the zoning requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hired the Costa Mesa engineering firm of Linscott, Law & Greenspan to 
survey the 69 retailers in both shopping centers to measure support for the 
bridge. Of the 66 businesses responding to the survey, 83% supported 
construction of the bridge, believing it would boost business.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; IDENTITY OF VIDEOTAPED BOYS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are trying to identify boys as young as 10 who were shown taking off 
their clothes in a videotape confiscated from a convicted child molester. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape was found during a search of the Garden Grove home of Kim Morgan 
Harper, 43, who was arrested in January for parole violation, according to 
Police Sgt. Mike Handfield, the head of a special unit that investigated the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Handfield said that the Orange County district attorney's office has filed 
child molestation charges against Harper, who is being held in Chino state 
prison while awaiting trial. If convicted, Harper could face 13 years in 
prison, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was the first suspect arrested by a special unit of the Garden Grove 
Police Department that was created in January to target dangerous criminals and 
sex offenders, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Handfield said that Harper registered as a sex offender with the Garden Grove 
police late last year following his parole from a child molestation sentence. 
He was immediately put under limited surveillance, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Harper in front of a liquor store in January when he was seen 
talking to a child, which is a parole violation, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the search of Harper's home, police found the tape showing boys exposing 
themselves to the camera and allowing Harper to fondle them, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that it was hard to identify the boys or determine where they live 
because Harper went to parks around Orange County, including Huntington Beach, 
Anaheim, Orange and Garden Grove.BERT ELJERA

 Hundreds of Orange County residents on Saturday are expected to take part -- 
both above and below the water line -- in Coastal Cleanup Day, a statewide day 
of beach cleaning and environmental awareness that begins at 8 a.m. on most 
county beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, scuba divers will be scouring local reefs and kelp forests 
for underwater garbage.Registration begins at 7:30 a.m. at seven local beaches, 
and organizers say it will be the largest coastline and underwater cleanup in 
city history. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seal Beach, volunteers will gather at the pier to receive gloves, trash 
bags and tally sheets for listing the type and amount of trash collected. It is 
the first year that Seal Beach volunteers will itemize the trash collected in 
conjunction with a national survey of beach debris conducted by the Center for 
Marine Conservation in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve in Huntington Beach, the cleanup is 
scheduled from 9 a.m. to noon. Last year, the annual cleanup attracted more 
than 200 volunteers. But this year, more than 300 are needed. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LEGALLY BLIND, HE HAS EYE FOR PHOTOS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert D. Wright has shown that with the use of modern technology, it doesn't 
take sharp eyesight to take sharp pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old Seattle resident, who is legally blind in both eyes, brought 
his auto-focus camera to Disneyland on Thursday to shoot cartoon characters for 
his "Breaking Down Barriers" photo montage. These images will be used for a 
theme poster focused on, well, theme parks. "I'm into bad puns," Wright 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 He is hoping that photo equipment companies will display his poster at trade 
shows to spread the message that visually handicapped people can successfully 
use today's high-tech cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was only 16 days old when he was blinded and nearly killed in a traffic 
accident. Today, his vision is 20/700, meaning that he must be 20 feet away to 
see something that a person with normal vision can see at 700 feet. Glasses 
improve his eyesight to 20/400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see well enough to know what it is, but I can't see details," said Wright, 
who gets state assistance checks because of his disability. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before auto-focus cameras hit the market, Wright had taken up 
photography as a hobby. He later enrolled in a community college course -- with 
mixed results, he admits. The instructor "didn't exactly like" the fact that a 
blind student was in the class, and he was less than enthusiastic about 
Wright's often-blurry photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he uses an auto-focus camera, his images have improved to the point 
where a prominent film company donates film and processing services to Wright, 
and may possibly employ him as a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland, Wright spent his morning competing with throngs of children as 
he snapped photos of Mickey, Minnie, Jafar and Princess Jasmine. He planned to 
document Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to photograph roller coasters," he said. "I ride 'em all."ALAN EYERLY

 The California Native Plant Society of Orange County will hold a plant sale 
Sept. 24 at the UC Irvine arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of plants native to California will be for sale.They include black 
and white sage and Matilija poppies, which stand 6 feet tall and produce white 
and yellow flowers. Society members will attend the sale to answer questions 
about the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Celia Kutcher, a member of the society, said native plants are a good choice 
for gardeners because they are drought-tolerant and provide food for native 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant sale will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The UCI arboretum is located at 
the university's north section off Campus Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale will go to fund scholarships and other activities 
sponsored by the society, which was formed in 1980 to conserve native 
vegetation. SHELBY GRAD

 The county has rejected several recommendations from the Orange County Grand 
Jury aimed at improving the navigational system at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said one of the grand jury's suggestions was based on 
questionable data while another recommendation should be addressed to the 
Federal Aviation Administration, not to local airport authorities.The county's 
response to the grand jury report was approved by the Board of Supervisors this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury said the county should consider installing new navigational 
aides such as beacons or radio signals on runway 19A, which is used by 
commercial aircraft. The panel found that up to 80% of commercial planes that 
use the runway stray slightly from the prescribed flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 But Courtney Wiercioch, manager of government and community relations for John 
Wayne Airport, said the county's data indicate that the vast majority of planes 
accurately follow the flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe that adding (more) navigational aides will improve 
compliance with the departure pattern," Wiercioch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury also suggested that John Wayne Airport implement a navigational 
aid known as the Global Positioning System. Wiercioch said the county will look 
into the GPS but stressed that the system is new and needs to be examined 
closely before any decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only endorsed by the FAA a few months ago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another grand jury recommendation involving flight patterns was not acted upon 
by the county because it falls under the jurisdiction of the FAA, Wiercioch 
said.SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; 697 MARIJUANA PLANTS SEIZED AT WAREHOUSE

 Nearly 700 marijuana plants with a street value of about $50,000 were seized 
from a warehouse by Orange County sheriff's deputies Wednesday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the plants were confiscated, officers arrested Cary David Snyder 
of Laguna Beach and Adam Jay Johnson of Newport Beach on suspicion of marijuana 
cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a significant bust," said Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. "We generally 
find people growing marijuana in garages or their homes. This was a pretty 
sophisticated operation." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,700-square-foot warehouse, listed as a chemical cleaning company, is in 
the Laguna Ridge Business Center at 23352 Peralta Drive. Other tenants told 
police that nobody visited the firm during business hours, although a man 
showed up every night about 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When workers in adjoining offices noticed unusual odors coming from the 
warehouse, they called the business park landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing a chemical spill, the landlord asked deputies to help her enter the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 As deputies walked inside, they recognized the strong scent of marijuana 
coming from the main warehouse, according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics investigators put the warehouse under surveillance, and about 8:30 
p.m. they saw two men trying to enter the office, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 28, and Johnson, 24, were arrested without incident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably wasn't the smartest thing to use a chemical company as a front," 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Confiscated were 697 marijuana plants growing in planters. Deputies said they 
also found an elaborate cultivation system with an automatic water regulator, 
heat lamps and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants ranged in size from inch-high sprouts to eight feet in height, 
Martini said. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY MANAGER SORSABAL RESIGNS AS OF NEXT 
JULY

<P>
 City Manager Fred Sorsabal will resign his job next July after serving a 
six-month extension on his contract that was granted by the City Council this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorsabal made his resignation official at Monday's council meeting."I promised 
myself and my wife that I would be here for five years," he told the council. 
"I have given you that, and by the time the extension is completed, it will be 
six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorsabal, 57, plans to retire in the Placerville area of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 After working as city manager of Costa Mesa for 15 years, Sorsabal was hired 
by Mission Viejo in 1989. He was the second city manager in Mission Viejo's 
six-year history. William Talley was first. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorsabal oversaw the accumulation of a $16-million city budget surplus. He 
helped establish a city redevelopment agency using the novel concept of 
declaring certain areas of the city as blighted because of chronic traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, council members had nothing but praise for his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert D. Breton told Sorsabal: "You're Mission Viejo's Clark Kent. 
Whenever we've needed a superperson to take on a challenge, you've been up to 
the challenge." FRANK MESSINA

 A second fund-raiser to build a new city library will be held Saturday with a 
book sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders Books & Music will contribute 10% of all sales on Saturday toward 
construction of the city library.The bookstore is at 25222 El Paseo in the 
Mission Viejo Freeway Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The event launches a month of fund raising for the library, during which the 
Mission Viejo Co. will match all contributions collected through Oct. 17, up to 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also during the same period, City Hall will double all money given to the 
library fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll get more book for your buck," said Sherri Butterfield, chairwoman of 
the Mission Viejo Library Foundation. "A small amount of money can turn into a 
substantial amount. A lot of people like to give when their money is 
multiplied." 
</P>
<P>
 The first fund-raising drive, held last June, brought in $35,000 from the 
community, which turned into $135,000 when the Mission Viejo Co. and City Hall 
made contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations can be mailed to the Mission Viejo Library Foundation at P.O. Box 
200-373, Mission Viejo, Calif. 92690. For more information, call (714)

FAMALARO KEPT ALONE IN CELL AFTER INMATES' THREATS; JAIL: LAWYER FOR SUSPECT IN 
HUBER CASE ASKED THAT HIS CLIENT BE PROTECTED. AUTHORITIES COMPLIED. 'EVEN 
CRIMINALS DON'T ACCEPT CERTAIN CRIMES,' A SHERIFF'S SPOKESMAN SAID.

<P>
 Because of safety concerns, murder suspect John J. Famalaro is being housed in 
a single-person cell and is escorted by an Orange County sheriff's deputy 
whenever he leaves it, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro gained notoriety as the accused killer of Denise Huber, a young 
Newport Beach woman who disappeared in June, 1991. Her nude, handcuffed body 
was found in July in a freezer stowed inside a stolen rental truck parked at 
Famalaro's home in Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Lake Forest house painter has received death threats from other 
inmates since he arrived at the Orange County Jail, according to his attorney, 
Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia. Gumlia asked the Sheriff's Department to 
take special precautions to ensure Famalaro's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini said Famalaro's background and the crime 
he is accused of committing were taken into consideration as jailing 
arrangements were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even criminals don't accept certain crimes and this is a very horrific 
crime," Martini said. "So there is a protection on both sides, protecting 
Famalaro's safety and the safety of others." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are generally very pleased with the situation now," Gumlia said, adding 
that his client had a few "rough" days but is doing as well as can be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 26 in Harbor Municipal Court in 
Newport Beach. He could face the death penalty if found guilty of murdering 
Huber.  
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was evaluated by the jail staff and put under a suicide watch 
following his extradition from Arizona. The special incarceration arrangements 
are similar to those used in other high-profile cases, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't unusual in these types of cases," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber was coming home from a concert when her car broke down on the Corona del 
Mar Freeway. Authorities said they believe she was abducted and then killed in 
a Laguna Hills warehouse where Famalaro was staying illegally.

A DEVOTED MOTHER -- AND VICTIM OF GANGS; EULOGY: MARIA CORONA WORKED TWO JOBS 
TO SUPPORT HER CHILDREN, UNTIL SHE DIED IN A CROSS-FIRE. FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
TURN OUT AT HER ROSARY AND RECALL A WOMAN WHO WAS FULL OF LIFE.

 Maria Elena Corona held dual jobs to support her two children. She loved the 
youngsters, ages 2 and 4, so much that she liked to update their portraits 
every year. She planned to do just that last Sunday, but never had the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona, 26, of Westminster, was fatally shot as she waited in traffic in Santa 
Ana on Saturday, the innocent victim of a gang cross-fire. On Thursday, 150 
people gathered here for her rosary. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you do?" a tearful Eduardo Corona, 51, said as he looked down at his 
eldest child as lying in the casket. "You can't do anything. I just wish we 
could live in peace. I just wish with all my heart that the violence would 
stop. It's something you can't erase -- losing a child under such conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he last saw his daughter two days before the shooting, but only 
briefly because he was heading off to work. He said he told her one of the 
headlights on her car looked low and that she ought to get it fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was that. . . . The next thing I knew she was gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Jr., 23, said little is known about what was behind his sister's 
death, but that it frightens him to think that someone precious and close to 
him could be taken away so quickly. "It's so out of control and there's going 
to come a time where it's going to get worse," he said. "This time it was my 
sister, the next time it's going to be a family." 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of the shooting, Maria Corona had just finished work at Cimco, a 
manufacturing company in Costa Mesa, where she worked full time. She also held 
a part-time job at Burger King in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona was known as Shorty to her colleagues at Cimco, who said she was always 
in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you needed some cheering up, you'd go talk to Shorty," said Henry Solano, 
45, her supervisor. "She was always quick to tell you a joke and would always 
laugh at your jokes even if they weren't funny. That's the kind of girl she 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Solano said Corona's job at Cimco was to assemble cardboard boxes for other 
workers to fill with products. Her other job, aside from working at Burger 
King, was supporting her two children, Manuel, 2, and Sara, 4. She and her 
husband were estranged and money was hard to come by, but she was too proud to 
get help from the government, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a loving and caring mother, and her family always came first," said 
her sister, Alicia Silva, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be at 10 a.m. today at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, 
1100 S. Center St., in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Burial will follow at Santa Ana Cemetery.

 A Huntington Beach man was shot in the arm early Thursday by a gunman while 
chatting with a friend on a beach lifeguard tower, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gross, 31, was listed in serious condition at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, said Officer Michael H. Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross was sitting on the tower, talking with Linda Anguiano, 27, of Anaheim at 
5 a.m. Thursday when a man about 50 feet away fired and hit Gross once, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, whom the victim did not recognize, fled on foot, possibly with 
two others, Corcoran said.

AUTO SHOP IS OKD NEAR 93-HOME AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid complaints by residents, the Planning Commission this week approved a 
conditional-use permit to allow an auto repair shop to operate within 200 feet 
of their houses on the west side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, who live in a 93-home community called California Seabreeze, 
complained that too much noise and smoke already came from the industrial park 
across the street, and asked that the permit be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Moroso, the shop owner, said that while he sympathized with the 
residents, his business will be different because it only specializes in 
corvettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Sumner, a board member of the California Seabreeze Homeowner's Assn., 
said an acoustical engineer took sound-level measurements in November and 
concluded that the noise levels were already 17 decibels above what the city 
allows.

POLICE ARREST 16 PEOPLE IN 8 DRUG RAIDS; INVESTIGATION: TARGETS INCLUDE HOMES 
AND AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP IN LA HABRA AREA. TWO CHILDREN ARE FOUND SLEEPING NEXT 
TO A SUSPECTED METHAMPHETAMINE LAB. 
</P>

<P>
 Authorities arrested 16 people in La Habra and La Habra Heights during a 
series of dawn raids Thursday on sites where police say methamphetamines were 
produced and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of about 70 officers with search warrants swooped down on eight 
sites, including five homes and a car repair shop in a Lambert Road industrial 
building that allegedly doubled as a drug factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Police SWAT teams arrested eight people and found two children sleeping inside 
a converted bay next to the shop, which contained chemicals and 
drug-manufacturing equipment, said La Habra Police Lt. Wayne Lowry. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest of three methamphetamine sweeps in the city in the past 
year and a half, Lowry said, and the latest in a string of raids on 
methamphetamine labs throughout Orange County. Authorities have raided 18 such 
labs countywide this year, five of them housed in industrial complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the drug of choice right now for some people. It's a stimulant and it's 
cheaper than cocaine," Lowry said. "There's a ready market -- and individuals 
ready to take the risk and cook it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the car shop at 2120 E. Lambert Road had reported strong chemical 
odors and suspicious activity there about a month ago, Lowry said. He said a 
police investigation yielded evidence that the shop and a site in a separate 
complex at 740 E. Lambert Road were used to make methamphetamine, a potent form 
of speed. Police obtained search warrants for the suspected factories, along 
with five other homes in La Habra and neighboring La Habra Heights that were 
suspected sales points. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of federal, state and local officials swooped down on all eight 
sites at the same time Thursday, arresting the 16 people on charges ranging 
from conspiracy to manufacture and sell drugs to unrelated warrants. Police 
also recovered beakers, hoses and other equipment used to make the drug, plus 
chemicals and an undetermined amount of the finished powder, Lowry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Juarez, who manages the apartment building next door to the 10-bay 
industrial building, said "they worked 24 hours a day. . . . A lot of people 
called me to complain that they couldn't sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez said police visited two days earlier asking to use a vacant apartment 
to watch the suspected lab. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the side-by-side bays raided by police was used for the drug operation 
and the other was converted into sleeping quarters, said Gary Hudson, who heads 
a unit in the state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement that tracks methamphetamine 
labs in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the two children were found in the converted area, next to the bay 
where volatile chemicals allegedly were turned into the oil that is later 
processed into methamphetamine powder. Hudson said police seized 10 gallons of 
the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowry said the children -- a 4-year-old boy and 11-year-old girl -- were being 
interviewed by officials from the county Social Service Agency and would be 
placed in protective custody. He said it was unclear whether the parents were 
among those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex has 10 bays leased to a variety of businesses. The owner of a 
cabinet-making shop next to the alleged drug-processing lab unsuccessfully 
pleaded with police to let him past crime-scene tape to go to his shop. Next 
door, the Kiddie Kastle Preschool was empty after authorities warned the owner 
to evacuate just before the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked, absolutely shocked," said preschool owner Jann Zaratzian-Cohen. 
"We had no idea that this was going on."

TWO YOUTHS ARRESTED IN STABBING AT SCHOOL PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have arrested two juveniles in connection with a stabbing that 
critically wounded an 18-year-old Stanton youth earlier this week, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Buena Park boy and a 17-year-old Anaheim youth were arrested 
about 4 p.m. Wednesday on suspicion of attempted murder, according to Sgt. 
Steve Rodig of the Anaheim Police Department.The suspects, who were not 
identified because of their ages, were being held in Orange County Juvenile 
Hall, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our belief the incident is gang-related," Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the suspects stabbed Alfredo Alonso in the chest with a 
screwdriver Tuesday afternoon in the parking lot at Anaheim's Western High 
School, Rodig said. Alonso was there to pick up his 16-year-old sister from 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the suspects are students at Western High School, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonso is in guarded but stable condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, 
Rodig said.

MEAL TICKET; REED DOESN'T LET VAN NUYS TEAMMATES GO HUNGRY ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seated on a bench alongside the football field at Van Nuys High, senior 
tailback Larry Reed frowned slightly as he recalled the first play of his high 
school career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first time ever in a game and I really messed up and let the team 
down," said Reed, referring to a game against North Hollywood during his 
sophomore season when he played defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys led, 20-0, midway through the second half when Reed stepped onto the 
field. As the ball was snapped, the rookie cornerback was focused intently on 
his receiver and was startled to find North Hollywood running a sweep in his 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Head down, Reed lunged for the back's legs but grasped only air as the Huskie 
ballcarrier raced down the sidelines for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown itself was meaningless, but as the shutout disappeared so did a 
barbecue defensive coaches had promised the Wolves if they held North Hollywood 
scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some tough times after that," said Reed, whose older teammates were 
less than sympathetic to his plight. 
</P>
<P>
 These days it's opposing defenders who tend to come up empty-handed against 
Van Nuys and Reed. The 6-foot, 180-pound back rushed for exactly 1,000 yards 
last season as a junior and slashed through Palisades for 170 yards in 18 
carries last Friday in the Wolves' opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Pacific 10 Conference schools have expressed interest in Reed's 
talents, and with Taft, a City Section 4-A quarterfinalist last season invading 
Van Nuys tonight, Reed will have a chance to go against Toreador tailback Jerry 
Brown, a 1993 All-City selection who rushed for 1,761 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought of that all this week," Reed said. "I think it's going to be the 
No. 1 game in the Valley and a lot of people think it's going to be the 
Reed-Brown show. It's a great feeling for me to play against the City's No. 1 
tailback." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed will not just try to surpass Brown offensively, but as a free safety in 
the Van Nuys defense, he will try to bring Brown to a screeching halt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not too comfortable with playing defense," Reed said. "I never went both 
ways before and it's really tiring sometimes, but that's when you have to suck 
it up and play with a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the game is a potential springboard to further glory for himself and 
Van Nuys, Reed denies being nervous as the showdown approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good chance to prove ourselves to people who doubt us," Reed said. "No 
disrespect to Taft, but I told our guys not to put any unnecessary pressure on 
themselves. It's going to be a fun game whether we win or lose because it's a 
chance early in the season to find out how good a team we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's abilities on a football field are evident to almost anyone watching and 
have been a boon to third-year Van Nuys Coach George Engbrecht, who has guided 
the Wolves to 16 victories in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Larry)'s got a lot of natural instincts and he's very quick getting off the 
ball," Engbrecht said. "He's also very adept at catching the ball in traffic 
and seeing the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed owes much of his success to his father, Lawrence. Though the elder Reed 
didn't allow his son to don a helmet and shoulder pads until he reached high 
school, that didn't mean Larry's skills went undeveloped. He and his father 
would spend time in a park near their Van Nuys home doing footwork drills 
around cones and working to hone Larry's receiving talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be the defender and show me how to cut off of him, how to spin away, to 
go where he wasn't," Larry said. "He's helped me to be patient and to learn to 
pat my line or fullback on the back if they miss a block and say, 'You'll get 
'em next time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, who wore No. 30 last season, has changed this year to 22, his father's 
numerals, in honor of the time and dedication Lawrence has poured into his 
son's game. However, it's doubtful opposing coaches such as North Hollywood's 
Gary Gray will have trouble recognizing the Wolves' top back. Hard to Catch 
</P>
<P>
 "All I ever heard over the loudspeaker last year was 'Reed this' and 'Reed 
that,' " said Gray, whose team was lit up for 143 yards, two two-point 
conversions and three touchdowns by Reed. "He's an elusive, attacking back but 
it wasn't power so much as shiftiness. He'd hit the line and we had a hard time 
wrapping him up. We'd get one hand on him and he'd be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed carried the ball 159 times last fall despite being slowed by a midseason 
groin pull. He also suffered a concussion in the Wolves' regular-season finale 
against Monroe. That concussion and a nasty case of the flu kept Reed from 
practicing for Van Nuys' 49-13 defeat by Venice in a first-round game of the 
4-A playoffs. Reed rushed only three times for 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by that disappointment, Reed and the Wolves have set their sights 
higher in 1994. Reed mentions a City Section championship for the team and a 
2,000-yard season for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we make 2,000 yards I'm taking (the line) to Sizzler for all they can 
eat," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Reed is good enough on the field and in the classroom to run at a 
higher level will be decided later this year. He said Arizona, Arizona State 
and Texas have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to graduate most of all and then I hope there's a college out there 
that will give me a scholarship," Reed said. "I'm going to pick up my grades 
and get more serious about school. I want to still be playing football at this 
time next year."

SWORDPLAY GAINING IN POPULARITY

 A fledgling high school fencing league, including Chaminade, Harvard-Westlake 
and Villanova Prep, will begin swordplay next week and culminate with the 
crowning of team and individual champions in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California High School Fencing League, sanctioned by the Southern 
California Division of the U.S. Fencing Assn., also includes Bellflower, 
Norwalk and Victor Valley highs. The first of three individual tournaments is 
scheduled for Sept. 24 at 9 a.m. at Chaminade High. The first of three team 
tournaments is scheduled for Nov. 11 at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The league, not affiliated with the California Interscholastic Federation, was 
organized by fencing coaches to provide high school athletes who parry, 
reprise, fleche and thrust with a structured season similar to those of 
mainstream interscholastic sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of experimenting with it the last year or two, and now we are 
more organized," Harvard Coach Ted Katzoff said. "This is our first actual 
'season.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Katzoff, who is Master-at-Arms at Westside Fencing Center in Culver City and 
has taught fencing at UCLA, started coaching at Harvard in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fencing, like equestrian, is one of these esoteric sports, and the people who 
learn them just don't learn them at (any) school," said Chaminade Coach Father 
Lawrence Calhoun. "We're hoping this will grow and lead to some kind of state 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 High school fencers have been forced to compete on a club basis against 
sanctioned USFA opponents or against fencers from the few schools that 
participate in the sport. In recent years, the USFA has sponsored monthly high 
school tournaments in Southern California, which has helped generate interest. 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-1980s, Katzoff taught the basics of foil fencing to physical 
education instructors throughout Southern California through a grant by the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches at schools where the sport has flourished have expressed interest in 
forming leagues that will include team competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more fun to fence as a team than just as an individual thing," Calhoun 
said. "It's nice to have team wins. That's when you have spirit and can stand 
there and cheer."

TAYYAR HAS LEFT NEWPORT HARBOR FOR FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Tayyar, 6-foot senior point guard, transferred to Fountain Valley High 
from Newport Harbor at the beginning of the school year, Baron basketball Coach 
Gordon Billingsley confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real good player, excellent," Billingsley said. "He will make me look 
like a smarter coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Tayyar averaged 13.1 points and shot 73% from the free-throw line 
for the Sailors (13-13). 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley finished 22-6 and reached the quarterfinals of the section 
Division I-AA playoffs.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SOARS 58 AS ECONOMIC REPORTS EASE INFLATION FEARS; 
MARKETS: THE INDEX COMES WITHIN 50 POINTS OF THE 4,000 LEVEL, ITS HIGHEST 
CLOSING IN 7 MONTHS. BONDS ALSO GAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fading inflation fears propelled stocks to their third straight gain Thursday, 
lifting the Dow Jones industrials to within 50 points of the unprecedented 
4,000 level once again. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark average of 30 industrial stocks jumped 58.55 points to 3,953.88, 
its highest level in seven months and fewer than 25 points shy of its record 
high of 3,978.36, set Jan. 31. The increase was the largest since Aug. 24, when 
the industrial average jumped 70.9 points. In the last three sessions, the 
average has risen nearly 94 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market indexes also advanced, as overall gainers led losers by more 
than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled a moderate 
281.16 million shares, down from 297.44 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors bid up prices after determining that economic reports released 
Thursday continued to signal moderate U.S. inflation, which they hope will keep 
the Federal Reserve Board from raising interest rates a sixth time this year, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports also sparked gains in the bond market. The Treasury's bellwether 
30-year bond rose nearly $5 for every $1,000 in face value, and its yield 
dropped to 7.63% from 7.67% on Wednesday. Bond prices and yields move in 
opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports included one from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia saying 
that Northeast factories were expanding production but at a weak pace. A second 
report, from the Commerce Department, showed business stockpiles expanding only 
moderately in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got a second boost late in the session from a flurry of computerized 
program trades, which analysts noted were made just ahead of today's "triple 
witching" session, in which certain stock and index options and index futures 
will expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Dow Jones industrials' latest advance toward 4,000, analysts noted 
that many of the market's barometers -- and many of the public's mutual funds, 
for that matter -- are barely ahead for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by those results, Wall Street is just now getting back to where it was 
when 1994 began -- before the Fed launched the first of its aggressive moves 
lifting interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500 composite index, for instance, rose 6.01 on Thursday 
to 474.81, leaving it with a paltry 1.9% gain for the year so far. The Nasdaq 
composite index, by surging 10.05 to 778.66, is now ahead a mere 0.2% for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 And some analysts cautioned that the market, for the next few weeks at least, 
will probably continue to be buffeted by investors' rapidly changing sentiments 
about the economy's outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see some strong growth numbers, then weak growth numbers . . . so you 
have this tug and pull on the markets," said William H. Gross, managing 
director of Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably will be no definable trend, in terms of a significant bull or 
bear market, until we have a little more idea of where the economy is headed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Murphy, a Wall Street bear who publishes the Overpriced Stock Service 
newsletter in Half Moon Bay, Calif., said he concurs with many investors who do 
not expect the Fed to raise interest rates again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also asserted that "inflation is back, at least at the wholesale 
level," and that as those price gains move into the retail sector in coming 
months, "we're not going to get better consumer price index numbers than we're 
seeing" now. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, even if the central bank does not tighten credit further, 
"corporate profit margins will get squeezed," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, earnings reports again dictated wide swings for several stocks. 
Auto parts maker Federal-Mogul fell 3/4 to 24 after saying late Wednesday that 
it expected its profit to trail analysts' forecasts, but electronics supplier 
Tektronix leaped 4 to 38 1/4 on a strong quarterly earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the blue chips, General Motors climbed 1 3/8 to 51 5/8, AT&T rose 7/8 to 
55 1/8, General Electric gained 1 1/8 to 51 3/8 and Merck edged up 1/2 to 34 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 High-technology gainers included Texas Instruments, up 2 1/2 at 78; 
Hewlett-Packard, up 1 to 91 3/8, and Compaq Computer, up 1 1/2 to 37 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural Dynamics Research sank 2 3/4 to 4 7/8 in Nasdaq trading after the 
maker of computer-aided engineering gear said it would restate its financial 
results for the last 2 1/2 years. Analysts said Structural Dynamics' problems 
will boost the fortunes of rival Parametric Technology, which shot up 3 15/16 
to 31 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, London stocks finished sharply higher after seven 
consecutive days of declines. The FTSE-100 average closed 32.9 points higher at 
3,112.7. Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average fell 10.14 points to 2,113.98. The 
Tokyo stock market was closed for a national holiday. Mexico City's Bolsa index 
also reached its highest level in seven months, gaining 61.49 to 2,804.64.

Q & A; THE BOTTOM LINE; BASIC RATES WILL RISE, LOCAL TOLL PRICES WILL DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Sharply higher fees for basic telephone service. Big drops in the cost of 
local toll calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are two of the chief results for Californians of a long-awaited decision 
Thursday by the state Public Utilities Commission to open to competition the 
market for local toll calls, traditionally the province of monopolies such as 
Pacific Bell and General Telephone Co. of California. Here is a look at how 
consumers will be affected: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does the ruling mean for the state's 21 million telephone users? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Beginning Jan. 1, Californians will be able to place local toll calls 
through the phone company of their choice--either the local telephone company 
or a long-distance carrier such as MCI, Sprint, AT&T or one of many smaller 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will happen to rates? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Rates for local toll calls--those to points more than 12 miles away within 
the same local calling area--will drop dramatically, by an average of 39% 
statewide. For example, a three-minute daytime call from Los Angeles to Anaheim 
or San Francisco to Sunnyvale, which now costs 75 cents, would drop to 36 cents 
as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 However, rates for basic telephone use and other local phone services will 
rise--quite substantially, in some cases. Pacific Bell's monthly residential 
flat rate will climb $2.90, or 35%, to $11.25. The basic residential rate at 
GTE, which has higher costs and a smaller customer base, will soar by $6.05 to 
$17.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC projected that Pacific Bell's median monthly residential customer bill 
will rise 42 cents to $22.73 beginning Jan. 1. In other words, half the 
company's residential customers will see an increase of 42 cents or more, and 
the other half will see bills climb less than 42 cents or decline. GTE's median 
customer bill will rise $3.48 to $25.15. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why must the cost of basic telephone service go up? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The PUC said the increases are designed to help make up for the revenue 
local phone companies will lose when they give up their monopoly in this 
$3-billion "local long-distance" market. Boosting the fee for local service 
also brings the price closer to what it actually costs the companies to provide 
the service, the commission noted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't competition supposed to mean lower prices? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but the phone system isn't yet fully competitive. Basic service is 
still a monopoly. Eventually, state and federal policy-makers are to deregulate 
local service as well, theoretically ushering in lower phone rates overall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who stands to gain or lose the most? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Residential and business customers who place frequent local toll calls will 
benefit the most. In many cases, the rise in their cost for basic telephone 
service will be more than offset by declines in their toll call bills. But 
customers who do not place such calls will face higher fees for basic service 
with no offsetting reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates contend that big business will come out on top, with 
lower-income and elderly customers suffering the most because they do not place 
many toll calls. But a Pacific Bell official disagreed, saying these customers' 
calling patterns differ little from those of other customers. About 20% of 
Pacific Bell's customers make no local toll calls in a given month, the company 
said, but the official speculated that, as rates drop, more people will be 
inclined to make toll calls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about those who can't afford the higher basic rates? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Both Pacific Bell and GTE will continue to offer Universal Lifeline 
service, designed for low-income customers who otherwise would not be able to 
afford phone service. Their rates will increase, but not as much as regular 
customers'. Under the PUC's plan, the flat rate for both companies will rise to 
$5.62. That represents a $1.44 increase for Pacific Bell and a 75-cent boost 
for GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will a customer place a local toll call through a competing carrier? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Providing a boon to Pacific Bell and GTE, the PUC dictated that callers 
will have to dial a five-digit access code to reach any other company. If a 
caller does not dial a code, the local phone company will handle the call, as 
it does now. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, callers will not have the option of signing up with a new carrier 
to routinely handle local toll calls and thereby circumvent the access code 
requirement, as they can with long-distance companies. However, long-distance 
carriers earlier this year asked the PUC to offer customers the chance to 
"pre-subscribe," and the commission said Thursday that it will look into the 
idea soon. 
</P>
<P>
 A PUC regulatory analyst noted that many business customers with PBX or other 
special phone systems and residential customers with speed dialing can 
pre-program an access code. But she acknowledged that in the early going, the 
access code requirement will be advantageous to the local companies. The New 
Rate Structure 
</P>
<P>
 The decision: The Public Utilities Commission has approved rules that will 
allow competition in the local long-distance market starting Jan. 1. These 
changes require a new rate structure for Pacific Bell and GTE so they can 
compete with long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: When the old AT&T was broken up in 1984, the seven regional Bell 
operating companies were created to provide local telephone service. The 
remnants of AT&T, as well as competitors such as MCI and Sprint, were 
authorized to provide long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
 LATAs: To define what would be a local call and what would be a long-distance 
call at the time of the AT&T breakup, the nation was divided into Local Access 
and Transport Areas (LATAs), based on the Census Bureau's Standard Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Types of calls: Bell companies are prohibited from carrying calls between 
LATAs. These calls are the province of long-distance companies, though new 
federal legislation may soon allow local phone companies into the market. 
Within LATAs, calls between points more than 12 miles apart are toll calls, or 
"local long distance." In California, the local phone company has had a 
monopoly on such calls. That will end Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 SOME SAMPLE RATES 
</P>
<P>
 Opening California's local long-distance market to competition will have a 
dramatic impact on telephone pricing, raising basic service charges but 
lowering local long-distance rates. Here's a brief wrap-up. Rates for local 
long-distance calls are what Pacific Bell projects it will charge; competitors 
could charge less. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates between cities within a regional calling area would decrease an average 
of 44%: 03,29,16,16 Typical five- Typical five- minute daytime minute daytime 
call under old call under new Call rates rates Anaheim to Los Angeles $1.04 
$0.60 Van Nuys to Downey 0.89 0.50 Riverside to Pasadena 1.34 0.75 San

BASEBALL PUTS ADVERTISERS IN A PICKLE; CANCELLATION OF '94 SEASON HAS FIRMS 
SEEKING OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cancellation of the 1994 baseball season has left many advertisers 
scrambling for scarce commercial time on other programs and may lead some firms 
to re-evaluate future baseball-related promotions and ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "A controversy has been created and it's something that these corporations 
would rather not get involved in," said Alan Friedman, editor of Team Marketing 
Report, a Chicago-based sports business publication. "It might lead some 
companies to cut down on advertising because they fear fan reaction next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball owners wrote off the rest of the regular season as well as the 
playoff games and World Series in October after failing to reach an agreement 
to end a 34-day players strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation comes at a time when many consumer product companies -- such 
as beer, automobile and movie makers -- begin their seasonal fall ad campaigns 
and introduce new products. Such companies spend about $500 million annually on 
baseball-related ads, according to the trade publication Advertising Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is a favorite among advertisers seeking a young, male audience. And 
the World Series typically offers an excitement level and audience size that 
are hard to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are trying to reach a male audience, you are definitely going to buy 
sports and you are going to buy baseball," said one Hollywood studio ad 
executive. "There are other choices, but the market is very tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers say the strike and truncated season haven't cost them any lost 
business, but the financial impact is hard to measure. A Nintendo computer 
baseball game bearing the name of Seattle Mariner star Ken Griffey Jr., who was 
trying to break baseball's single-season home run record, has remained one of 
the company's top five sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, we are losing something by not having a nightly (news) 
feature on Griffey and his run for the record," said George Harrison, spokesman 
for Seattle-based Nintendo of America. "We really can't judge what impact that 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 The strike actually inspired an ad campaign by Nike. The sports shoe and 
apparel maker created a series of television commercials featuring lonely fans 
pitching fast balls into empty seats or performing a one-person "wave" inside a 
desolate Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego. The ads included the phrase "Play 
ball, please." 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok said it plans to launch a campaign next spring featuring Chicago White 
Sox hitting star Frank Thomas, who starred in a similar campaign earlier this 
year for a $100 line of shoes that sold out. Thomas was also chasing Roger 
Maris' single-season home run record. But Reebok will look at its options if 
the strike continues next year, said Dan Hanrahan, vice president of global 
product marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are investing first in Frank but also in baseball," Hanrahan said. "We are 
developing alternative plans if baseball is still on strike next spring." 
</P>
<P>
 The only big winner coming out of baseball's disastrous season could be the 
Fox television network, which is airing pro football for the first time this 
year, by boosting ratings and demand for commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that are watching the baseball games are the same ones that are 
watching during the football season," said Andrew Woolf, vice president of 
World Class Sports, which provides sports stars for commercials and promotional 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Sports spokesman Vince Wladika said there was no evidence yet that 
baseball advertisers and viewers are turning to the fledgling network's 
football offerings. "We are just cautiously optimistic that we could possibly 
see some" gains, he said.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: 2 NBC SUITORS: A RARE BREED OF '90S MOGUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the government forced the major studios out of the movie theater business 
in the 1940s and the major television networks out of the program production 
business in the 1970s, who would have guessed that entertainment moguls would 
wind up consolidating more power than ever in the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner Chairman Gerald M. Levin and Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner already rule over kingdoms bigger than their autocratic predecessors 
could have imagined. Now, with talk that one may acquire General Electric's 
NBC, there's the chance to add the penetrating reach of a network to a 
collection of assets that includes film, TV, cable, music, theme parks, 
exhibition, publishing and video. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a measure of changing attitudes that no one's screaming bloody murder 
over their latest skyscraper-sized vertical integration moves. Most people 
assume that Time Warner, as a cable operator, can clear the regulatory hurdles 
standing in the way of an NBC deal. And Disney's path is even less cluttered, 
because it's not in the cable hardware business. As NBC discussions continue 
against the restless and competitive backdrop of the new-media world, the role 
of the mogul is in rapid transition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the very height of his power, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Chairman Louis B. Mayer 
dominated only one medium -- movies. Time Inc.'s Henry Luce had only 
publishing. Others added a few more pieces. Legendary CBS Chairman William S. 
Paley ran CBS TV, Radio and Records, and Gen. David Sarnoff linked the 
programming of his NBC network to the manufacturing of radios and TVs through 
RCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Those titans exercised power more visibly and forcefully, often because they 
were owners. They also operated in a less-crowded media environment, at the 
dawn of the modern communications era. But in today's fragmented world -- where 
movies compete with network TV, which competes with cable, which competes with 
video games, which compete with music -- Levin and Eisner are among the rare 
breed of executives with full reach. 
</P>
<P>
 As a music manufacturer, Time Warner sold a staggering 300 million CDs and 
cassettes worldwide last year by artists as varied as Eric Clapton, Naughty by 
Nature, Enya and George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Levin's Time Warner controls 20% of domestic magazine 
advertising revenue with perennials such as Time, People and Sports 
Illustrated; 14.6% of the domestic box office with movies such as "Natural Born 
Killers" and "Maverick"; 8.5 hours of prime-time network programming with 
popular shows such as "Murphy Brown" and "Full House"; the influential pay 
channel HBO; Six Flags theme parks; a piece of Ted Turner's Cable News Network, 
and about 9 million cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's business is more purely entertainment-based but no less omnipresent. 
It's possible for a child to go to bed in Disney's "Aladdin" pajamas, wake up 
and watch the Disney Channel's "Gummi Bears," eat a Mickey Mouse-shaped waffle 
for breakfast, pack a Donald Duck lunch box for school, dress in a Disney 
Mighty Ducks T-shirt, spend the afternoon watching a package of syndicated 
Disney cartoons or listening to the best-selling "The Lion King" soundtrack, 
then drift off to sleep with a Disney storybook like "Pinocchio." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 78 million movie tickets have already been sold to "The Lion King." 
About 15.5 million homes regularly tune in to the Disney-produced "Home 
Improvement." And even though the business is flat, 39 million people still 
visited Disney's domestic theme parks last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner has a higher profile than Levin so far, because he's been on the job 
longer and has taken over Uncle Walt's folksy role as Disney spokesman. They 
also have diametrically different personalities -- with Eisner seeming the 
polished and uncomplicated leader of a pop culture kingdom and Levin so 
introverted and studious that he often seems to fade out of group photographs. 
But both have put strong personal stamps on their companies, even if they've 
done it more subtly than moguls like Mayer, Paley, Luce and Sarnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, 55, is a former biblical literature student and lawyer who came up 
through the cable ranks at Time Warner. It was because of his civil-libertarian 
stance, however short-lived, that the controversy over rapper Ice T's "Cop 
Killer" song raged as long as it did last year. Levin's also more attuned to 
the high-tech world of new media than his predecessor, Steve Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, on the other hand, is a reflection of Eisner's colonization mentality, 
which has the company expanding everything from theme park locations to retail 
outlets. Much of what Disney produces is also the result of the middle-brow 
tastes of Eisner, 52, who put in time at all three major networks and Paramount 
before going to Disney. He was an early champion of movies such as "Down and 
Out in Beverly Hills," genuinely views theme parks as a place to have a 
rollicking good time and is said to be a major Chevy Chase fan. 
</P>
<P>
 A broadcast network would add immeasurably to those power bases. Even though 
cable has cut into their business, the major networks still provide the biggest 
direct line into American homes, with an average 9 million viewers per 
prime-time program. A network can also be used as a place to run 
studio-produced TV shows and movies, enter the news business, link up with new 
advertisers and devise cross-promotions too numerous to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 And the road to empire building doesn't end at NBC's Rockefeller Center. It's 
widely assumed that CBS and Capital Cities/ABC will be sold or partnered with 
other entertainment conglomerates before the dust clears in the stampede by 
companies to position themselves for the new-media age. Eisner could someday 
stage an entire Chevy Chase festival. And Levin could do wonders for Ice T's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a small world, after all: Hollywood's executive pool is so limited that 
people invariably cross paths more often than ants. Take the case of Tom 
McGrath, who was just named executive vice president of Viacom Entertainment 
Group, which includes Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath headed producer Norman Lear's Act III Communications before a bitter 
falling-out in 1990. He moved on to Time Warner, and Lear continued on with his 
own company. Now Lear is negotiating a TV production deal at Paramount -- just 
as McGrath assumes a senior management position at the company. Sources say 
there will be no impact on Lear's deal. The Changing Face of Media Titans 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary CBS Chairman William S. Paley, left, ran CBS TV, Radio and Records. 
Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner and Time Warner Chairman Gerald M. 
Levin now rule over kingdoms bigger than their autocratic predecessors could 
have imagined.

BLUE CROSS PLANS TO USE $2 BILLION FOR FOUNDATION; HEALTH CARE: THE PROPOSAL 
WOULD CREATE ONE OF THE NATION'S 10 LARGEST FOUNDATIONS. BUT CONSUMER GROUPS 
HAVE DOUBTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from the state and consumer advocates, Blue Cross of California 
announced plans Thursday to create a new public charity with assets of more 
than $2 billion to fund health programs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed California HealthCare Foundation would be the largest health 
foundation in California and one of the 10 largest foundations of any kind in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which must be approved by state regulators, would initially focus on 
funding primary and preventive care for children of uninsured families, mobile 
health screening clinics and poison control centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based Blue Cross has been under considerable pressure to 
disclose its charitable plan since last year, when it spun off most of its 
nonprofit health insurance programs into a new for-profit subsidiary, WellPoint 
Health Networks. Blue Cross retained an 80% ownership stake in WellPoint, one 
of the nation's largest publicly traded health insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 That move set off a flurry of criticism from state regulators, legislators and 
consumer advocates who said nonprofit Blue Cross was obligated to compensate 
the public for the tax-exempt status it had enjoyed while it built its health 
insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross initially proposed to contribute $100 million to charity over 20 
years, but state regulators said the amount was far too low. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates on Thursday said they approve of some aspects of the new 
Blue Cross plan, but they expressed concern about certain details. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very skeptical," said Maryann O'Sullivan, project attorney for 
Consumers Union in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Blue Cross said, it will transfer all of its assets and public 
benefit activities to the new charitable foundation, separating it from the 
for-profit WellPoint unit. The Blue Cross name and trademark would go over to 
WellPoint, whose health plans cover about 2.5 million Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross' main asset is 80 million shares of WellPoint stock -- valued at 
$2.2 billion, based on Thursday's closing price of $27.625, which was unchanged 
in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The move means that Blue Cross, one of the oldest nonprofit insurance 
organizations in the nation, would cease to exist as a nonprofit company under 
the Blue Cross name. If the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn. approves 
the transfer of the name to a for-profit entity, the California organization 
would be the first of the association's nearly 70 members to make such a 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe establishing and endowing this foundation is the best way for Blue 
Cross to fulfill its mission to improve the quality of health care and improve 
access for everyone," said Leonard D. Schaeffer, Blue Cross chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corporations Commissioner Gary Mendoza said his agency will 
review the Blue Cross plan. "This is a significant issue for the state of 
California, and it's important that we treat it with appropriate deliberation," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said he is concerned about one aspect of the plan, noting that the 
same 19-member board of Blue Cross would become the new directors of the 
California HealthCare Foundation. The new board would be chaired by Schaeffer, 
who also sits on the board of WellPoint. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that could create a conflict of interest between what Blue Cross is 
calling an independent charitable foundation and WellPoint. "We have previously 
raised the issue with Blue Cross," he said, "and it remains an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Union's Sullivan put it more strongly: "Leonard Schaeffer will be 
influential, and it's inappropriate for him to be there" on the foundation 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Patrick Garner, a Blue Cross senior vice president, said he sees no 
potential conflicts with the foundation's board. "I think there's almost no 
person you could put on a board that wouldn't have an ax to grind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer group also said Blue Cross should not be responsible for deciding 
which organizations are worthy of receiving charity funds, as set out in its 
proposal. "This is the public's money, not Blue Cross'," O'Sullivan said.

 Ford Agrees to Settle Bronco II Suit: The auto maker said it will distribute 
safety information to 700,000 owners of the sport utility vehicle to settle a 
class-action lawsuit. Under the agreement, which is subject to approval by the 
U.S. District Court in Louisiana, Ford Motor Co. will mail warning labels that 
fit on the sun visor of the vehicle that caution drivers to avoid sharp turns 
or abrupt maneuvers.The settlement only covers Ford Bronco IIs built between 
1983 and 1990. The Bronco II has been the subject of numerous lawsuits from 
drivers claiming that the vehicle rolls over during sharp turns. "We feel this 
is a good and fair settlement from our viewpoint because there is nothing wrong 
with these vehicles," a Ford spokeswoman said.

BIG O TIRES HIRES OFFICIAL TO HELP DECIDE IF COMPANY SHOULD BE SOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Big O Tires Inc. hired Horst K. Mehlfeldt, a company director and former 
senior vice president at General Tire Inc., to help it decide whether it should 
be sold, seek a merger or pursue some other alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The tire retailer's board of directors hired Mehlfeldt after receiving a 
preliminary report on its options this week from investment banker PaineWebber 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Englewood, Colo., hired PaineWebber in July in response 
to a successful shareholder proxy fight calling for the company to explore 
options to enhance shareholder value. The proposal was pushed by Big O's 
largest shareholder, Kenneth Pavia, general partner of Balboa Investment Group 
LP in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber did not make a final recommendation, a Big O spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 John E. Siipola, Big O chairman, said the board's investment committee "is 
taking action to look into the alternatives that were presented for enhancing 
the values of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 The company did not disclose Mehlfeldt's compensation for his new role. 
PaineWebber will continue to advise the company, Big O said.

ITT PROPOSES $4-BILLION FUND FOR ACQUISITIONS; TAKEOVERS: THE FIRM PLANS TO 
SHED UNITS SO IT CAN BUY MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT FIRMS.

<P>
 ITT Corp. plans to raise about $4 billion to finance media and entertainment 
acquisitions by selling its commercial finance, installment lending and 
reinsurance units, a person close to the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based conglomerate, which has businesses in auto parts, insurance 
and hotels, plans to keep its ITT Hartford insurance unit, according to the 
person who spoke on condition that he not be identified.The company's board 
made the decision at a Monday meeting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed sale is in line with the company's plan to boost shareholder 
returns by shifting into industries that demand higher market values from 
investors, such as media and entertainment, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "ITT is clearly looking to sell assets where the valuations in the marketplace 
are low, such as financial services, and is looking to move into areas where 
they can get a higher (price to earnings ratio) in the market," said Phua 
Young, a Lehman Bros. analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock declined $1.50 to $80.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT, in partnership with Cablevision Systems Corp., entered the media and 
entertainment business in late August with its $1.075- billion purchase of New 
York's Madison Square Garden from Viacom Inc. The Garden includes the nation's 
largest regional cable television sports network, a 20,000-seat arena, a 
performance theater and the New York Knickerbockers and New York Rangers sports 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also is reportedly bidding to acquire General Electric Co.'s NBC 
television network. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's ITT Sheraton hotel unit could get a price-to-earnings multiple 
of 20, or closer to that of rivals Marriott International Inc. and Hilton 
Hotels Corp., Young said. The same is true for entertainment companies, he 
said.

SECURITY ENVIRONMENTAL'S CO-FOUNDER LEAVES THE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Grossman has resigned from Security Environmental Systems Inc., the 
environmental services company he helped create. The Thursday announcement came 
two days after his brother, co-founder Stephen Grossman, announced his 
resignation from the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, along with their father, Alfred Grossman, had run the Huntington 
Beach company for the past 20 years. Alfred Grossman, who had his annual salary 
reduced from $125,000 to $60,000 earlier this week, still sits on the board of 
directors. At the same time, Jonathan Grossman had agreed to a 28% annual pay 
cut to $90,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Batzel, Security Environmental's president, said the Grossman brothers 
agreed "to get out of the way and let the new management take over. . . . They 
don't have the skills to the take the company to where it should be in the 
growth cycle."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Batzel, a new chief financial officer has recently been 
appointed and the company is currently searching for a new chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Grossman, 39, was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for 
comment. Albert Grossman declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of Jonathan Grossman's severance package were not released and Batzel 
said that he has not announced his plans.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Grossman, 43, has said he will continue as a consultant to the 
company's bio-medical waste program, which it plans to restart in New Mexico 
this year, according to Batzel. 
</P>
<P>
 All the changes signify the corporate officers' commitment to make Security

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ROCKWELL AND ALLIEDSIGNAL JOIN FORCES IN AIRCRAFT BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Units of Rockwell International Corp. and AlliedSignal announced Thursday that 
they will join forces to compete for contracts to build the avionics 
integration program for the Czech Republic's L-159 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between Rockwell's North American Aircraft Modification Division 
and AlliedSignal's Government Electronic Systems forms the only U.S. team 
competing in the L-159 program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell would be the prime contractor for the integrated navigation and 
weapon delivery system, while AlliedSignal would provide avionics subsystems 
and services, according to the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech Republic is expected to select its L-159 avionics contractor later 
this year. AlliedSignal was awarded a contract for its F124-GA-100 engine for 
the aircraft earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The L-159 is a new light-attack, multi-role/training aircraft designed and 
developed by Aero Vodochody for the Czech Republic Air Force and other 
international customers. The Czech Air Force is expected to place an initial 
order for 72 aircraft late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's role would include integration of an avionics and weapons delivery 
system. AlliedSignal could provide multi-function liquid crystal displays, 
identification-friend-or-foe technology and an air data computer.

COMMODITY PRICES, INVENTORIES COOL OFF; ECONOMY: POSITIVE REPORTS FROM 
PHILADELPHIA FED AND COMMERCE DEPT. LIFT THE STOCK MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported Thursday that prices for raw 
materials and finished goods fell this month in the Philadelphia area, while 
manufacturing continued to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Commerce Department reported that business inventories 
increased only moderately in July, easing concerns that excessive stockpiles 
could be a major drag on the economy for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets reacted positively to both reports, with the Dow Jones 
industrial average soaring nearly 60 points. The 0.3% gain reported in business 
inventories is the fourth straight increase but the smallest since inventories 
fell in March. The size of the backlog was less than half the 0.7% rise 
anticipated by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Fed's September prices-paid index for raw materials fell to 
40.4 from 48.4 in August, while its prices-received index for manufactured 
goods fell to 15.0 from 24.5. The indexes are considered bellwethers of the 
national economic picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline comes after last month's survey found prices paid and received by 
manufacturers for raw materials surged to five-year highs. At the time, the 
news was a surprise because other reports showed little price growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's numbers signal some cooling off in commodity type inflation," said 
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Fed also said its index of general economic activity rose to 
14.8 from 13.9 last month, and its index of future economic activity rose to 
27.3 from 26.7 in August.  
</P>
<P>
 Economists at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates of Princeton, N.J., said 
the survey suggests that general economic activity in the Philadelphia Fed 
district is expanding at about the same pace as in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Moran cautioned against reading too much into the drop in the 
prices component of the survey, saying that it is traditionally a volatile part 
of the index. "Previous large increases or decreases have often turned out to 
be just blips," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the decline in the prices-paid index, it's still above July levels, 
indicating signs of inflation are still present, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $891.5 
billion, up from $889.1 billion in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase follows a 0.4% rise in June and a 1.2% buildup in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The May advance, the largest since inventories climbed 1.3% in October, 1987, 
prompted some analysts to predict slower economic growth in the second half of 
this year if sales failed to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Labor Department said 3,000 fewer Americans filed first-time 
claims for unemployment benefits last week, the lowest level in three weeks. It 
said 327,000 people filed jobless claims in the week ended Sept. 10.

PEOPLE: J.P. MORGAN CHAIRMAN, CEO ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the nation's leading bankers, Dennis Weatherstone, on Thursday 
announced his retirement as chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan & Co. 
He is the second top Wall Street executive to give notice this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherstone, a 63-year-old native of England, will step down after four years 
at the head of the nation's fifth-largest banking company. He will be succeeded 
by the firm's president on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 During Weatherstone's tenure, which coincided with one of the industry's most 
turbulent eras, Morgan sharpened its traditional focus on corporate and 
merchant banking. The firm does little business in credit cards and savings 
accounts. It remained one of the industry's most stable and profitable banks at 
a time when rivals such as Citicorp suffered dramatic losses from commercial 
real estate lending. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm also shed its stodgy image by engaging in aggressive trading in Latin 
American bonds and in the profitable but controversial business of financial 
derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some other companies, Morgan has generally made considerable amounts of 
money from derivatives. These financial contracts are intended to help 
companies minimize risk in turbulent markets but are sometimes used 
speculatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherstone and his deputies have recently mounted an aggressive defense of 
the booming derivatives business. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherstone's successor will be an American, Douglas A. (Sandy) Warner III, 
who has been president since 1990. The bank's board on Wednesday elected 
Warner, 48, to take over as chairman, president and chief executive, the bank 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner started at Morgan after graduating from Yale University in 1968. He 
served as general manager of Morgan's London office in 1986, then returned to 
New York the next year to head the bank's domestic corporate finance 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherstone started his career in London in 1946 with Guaranty Trust Co., a 
bank that later merged with Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherstone's retirement comes two days after the unexpected resignation of 
Stephen Friedman, chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Co., another powerful Wall 
Street firm. Friedman, 56, cited the job's demanding schedule and a desire to 
spend more time with his family as reasons for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank analysts were not surprised by the news of Weatherstone's departure and 
said they expect few changes in direction at Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Genentech, Inc. announced the promotions of Louis J. Lavigne Jr. to senior 
vice president and chief financial officer and Stephen Juelsgaard to vice 
president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavigne, who joined Genentech in 1982, will be is responsible for the South 
San Francisco-based biotechnology firm's treasury, control, information 
systems, insurance, investor relations, tax, planning and purchasing functions. 
Most recently he was vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this appointment, Juelsgaard was vice president, corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael L. Walling has joined Los Angeles-based Western Bank as senior vice 
president. Walling was previously executive vice president and main loan office 
loan administrator with Santa Monica Bank.

AMGEN, PHONE ENTREPRENEUR WIN MEDAL OF TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California biotechnology innovator Amgen Inc. and San Diego cellular 
telephone entrepreneur Irwin M. Jacobs are among six winners of this year's 
National Medal of Technology, the Clinton Administration announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks-based Amgen is one of only five companies ever to receive the 
prestigious award, which generally goes to individuals. The firm was recognized 
for developing biologically engineered medicines that have improved the quality 
of life of many cancer and kidney patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, a prolific inventor who holds six key patents, has spent 25 years 
developing wireless communications technology. In recent years, he has focused 
primarily on cellular telephones. Jacobs is chairman and chief executive of a 
San Diego communications company, Qualcomm Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The medal, first issued in 1985, is the nation's highest technology award. 
</P>
<P>
 Other 1994 recipients include Corning Inc., the New York-based manufacturer 
known primarily for its glassware. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who 
announced the awards, said Corning was cited for innovations spanning 125 
years, including lighting, TV and optical communications products. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Joseph Gerber, founder of Gerber Scientific Inc. in Connecticut, will 
receive a medal for his work in automating a variety of industries, 
particularly apparel manufacturing. Medals will also be given to Joel S. Engel 
of Ameritech Corp. and Richard H. Frenkiel of AT&T Bell Laboratories, who were 
jointly recognized for their work in cellular mobile communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen, founded just 14 years ago, has become the largest independent 
biotechnology company in the world, with $1.4 billion in annual sales. Its 
primary products are Epogen, which treats severe anemia in kidney dialysis 
patients, and Neupogen, which is administered to cancer patients undergoing 
certain types of chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs was honored for adapting a technology, once reserved for secure 
military and satellite use, to the needs of commercial wireless communications. 
Known as code division multiple access technology, it became the industry 
standard for digital cellular telephone services in this country, enabling 
cellular networks to handle up to 20 times more calls than they could with 
previous technologies.

 Raytheon Announces Consolidation, Job Cuts: The Lexington, Mass.-based company 
said it would cut 940 jobs in the United States and Britain as it combines its 
Beech Aircraft and Corporate Jet subsidiaries into one aviation business to be 
called Raytheon Aircraft Co.Weak demand in the business aviation market 
prompted the company to seek ways to lower costs. The firm said it would cut 
450 jobs in Wichita, Kan.; 140 in Little Rock, Ark., 40 in Salina, Kan., and 
310 in England. Raytheon Corp. acquired Beech in 1980 and bought Raytheon 
Corporate Jets from British Aerospace about a year ago. The company also said 
it would move the final assembly and engineering and support activities for the 
Hawker mid-size jets -- made by Raytheon Corporate Jets -- from Britain to 
Wichita.

 QVC Takeover Hits Snag: The cash tender offer by cable TV operators Comcast 
Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc. for the home shopping network firm will 
likely be delayed until at least late October or early November, a source said, 
due to further antitrust scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission of TCI's 
controlling stake in rival Home Shopping Network. As reported first by the 
Washington Post, federal regulators are considering a challenge to the proposed 
purchase of QVC because of TCI's role.If TCI bows out, more bidders might 
surface. Sources said that in the earlier round, would-be rivals did not want 
to anger TCI because it controls more than a fifth of the nation's subscribers 
and might drop QVC from its systems.

 IBM May Delay Introduction of PowerPC Computer: International Business 
Machines Corp. may delay introduction of the computers until early 1995 to 
coincide with the release of a new version of OS/2, the operating system 
software necessary to control the basic functions of the computers, a source 
close to the company said. A version of OS/2 geared toward IBM's PowerPC-based 
PCs isn't scheduled to be released until the middle of next year.Armonk, 
N.Y.-based IBM previously had said it would introduce the computers by the end 
of the year. A spokeswoman wouldn't say when the machines would be released. 
PowerPC News, a newsletter distributed through the Internet, reported that the 
three PowerPC-based machines would be delayed until February.

 Ford Raises Prices Slightly on '95 Models: The auto maker said prices of its 
new model year cars and trucks will average 0.1% more than the pre-introduction 
prices announced earlier this summer.With the hike, which amounts to about $22 
per vehicle, Ford's average vehicle prices for 1995 are up an average of 1.4%, 
or $281, from final 1994 prices. Ford's move is the latest in a series of price 
boosts by U.S. and Japanese auto makers. In July, General Motors hiked prices 
of its 1995 models an average 2.5%, or $494 per vehicle, and Chrysler announced 
price increases averaging 2%.

 Two Money Supply Measures Fall: The Federal Reserve Board reported that the 
measure of the nation's money supply known as M2 fell in the week ended Sept. 5 
to a seasonally adjusted $3,594.8 billion, down $3.3 billion from a revised 
$3,598.1 billion the week before.A broader measure, M3, fell $3.2 billion to 
$4.239.9 billion from $4.243.1 billion, while the narrowest measure, M1, rose 
$1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $1,155.9 billion from $1,154.9 billion. M1 
includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank 
travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market 
mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of 
deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000.

RENTAL CAR RATES EXPECTED TO RISE FOR THIRD YEAR IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business travelers who rent cars are about to take another hit in the 
pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates are likely to go up again, mainly because the prices Detroit charges for 
new fleet cars have risen again, for the third year in a row, the rental car 
industry reports. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey from Runzheimer International, a Wisconsin-based consulting 
firm, pegs the probable increase in rental rates at 10% to 15% -- a jump it 
says is considerably larger than business travelers are likely to encounter for 
air fares, hotel rooms or meals. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, there is evidence that gasoline prices are edging up. They did 
not fall following the summer travel season as they usually do, and market 
factors along with regulatory changes may result in more increases this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Russo, vice president for government and public affairs at Hertz Corp., 
says there will be another 30% increase in fleet costs -- the prices the 
companies pay for their new cars -- across the industry this autumn, the third 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the industry has seen a contraction in available supply, particularly 
from General Motors -- all of which means tremendous pressure on prices to move 
up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we can anticipate higher car rental rates, starting this fall. I don't 
have a number, but to put it in perspective fleet costs account for about a 
third of (car rental company) costs -- the other components include insurance, 
staffing, facilities and so on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But no one in the industry is escaping it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is will it (the increase) stick. In the past, prices moved up 
but were somewhat peeled back market by market depending on competitive 
factors, the mix of leisure and business travel and how much traffic the 
airlines were attracting," Russo added. 
</P>
<P>
 Another on-the-road expense is also rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Diener, whose company books hotel rooms through volume purchases -- what 
the industry calls a "consolidator" -- reports that some room rates have risen 
by as much as 10% to 15% recently because hotel occupancy rates are up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because most of the discontinued (room rate) programs were offered for 
midweek travel, the business traveler is going to feel the brunt of these price 
increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diener's company, Dallas-based Hotel Reservations Network books rooms at rates 
it says are as much as 60% off the listed prices in more than 20 U.S. and 
European cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Cornwell, president of Express Reservations in Boulder, Colo., a company 
specializing in New York and Los Angeles hotel rooms at discount rates, agrees 
that prices are firming up in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 He said in the case of New York City, business is picking up because of an 
improved economy and the fact that room taxes -- which were the stiffest in the 
country -- are being rolled back. In the case of Los Angeles, the damper placed 
on travel by earthquakes and civil disturbance has eased.

MORTGAGE-BACKED FUNDS MIGHT WARRANT ANOTHER LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These have been hard times for funds that buy mortgage-backed securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors rushed into them to escape low money fund rates in the early 
'90s. But as interest rates fell sharply, homeowners refinanced their high-rate 
mortgages with lower-rate loans in 1993. That caused returns on mortgage 
securities to fall sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 But now with the market so low, it might be time to take another look at the 
mutual funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities. They look like a 
bargain right now. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger funds invest in GNMA securities, known as Ginnie Maes, that are 
backed by residential mortgages. The money from those mortgage payments is 
passed through to the security holders. The securities are backed by government 
agencies, so credit risk is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they typically pay slightly higher yields than Treasury securities. 
They are a good way for conservative investors to eke a bit more income out of 
their fund holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts predicted better results for the funds this year, but 1994 
hasn't been so great. Most mortgage funds have limped along, posting poor 
returns even though interest rates moved sharply higher. The average mortgage 
fund lost 2.5% over the first eight months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, some portfolio managers of general bond funds have been 
loading up on Ginnie Maes. Why? As interest rates jumped this year, the 
refinancing boom ran out of steam. And since the securities had fallen so far, 
they looked attractive. As more investors notice that fact, their prices are 
likely to move higher. When that happens, you may want to hold a chunk of your 
fixed-income portfolio in funds that buy mortgage-backed securities. 
</P>
<P>
 One caveat: Avoid mortgage funds that have stuffed their portfolios with 
exotic derivatives. As interest rates have risen, funds that used derivatives 
as a hedge were left with huge losses. Piper Jaffray's Institutional Government 
Income Portfolio and PaineWebber's Short-Term U.S. Government Income fund 
suffered significant and well-publicized losses, in part due to derivatives and 
other exotic instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Among funds to consider is Vanguard Fixed Income GNMA, which carries no 
initial sales charge and has annual expenses of only 0.28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund manager Paul Kaplan took the reins in March when former manager Paul 
Sullivan retired. But Kaplan had worked at the fund under Sullivan since the 
fund's inception in 1980. Together, the two forged an admirable record, beating 
the typical bond fund's performance by a solid margin while subjecting 
investors to below-average risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Benham GNMA Income has a history of delivering solid returns at below-average 
risk. The fund was managed by Jeff Tyler and Randy Merk until December. Since 
then, Tyler has managed it alone and has made some changes to adapt to shifts 
in the mortgage marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Tyler and Merk devoted much of their time to trying to predict 
which mortgages were likely to be prepaid as rates fell; thus, they could avoid 
those securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, prepayments have become more difficult to predict. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dreyfus GNMA, manager Garritt Kono has delivered consistently solid returns 
by sticking with plain-vanilla GNMAs. He occasionally shifts some assets to 
cash when he thinks GNMAs are expensive or risky; however, he has recently been 
loading up on mortgage-backed securities, looking for gains as their prices 
recover.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: A HOT TIP FOR COFFEE LOVERS: MOST RETAILERS 
PREFER TO MAKE IT SCALDING 
</P>

 How hot is your coffee? Probably hotter than you think. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, an Albuquerque, N.M., jury awarded $2.7 million to a woman scalded 
by McDonald's coffee--an amount reduced this week to $480,000 by the trial 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury blamed McDonald's for continuing to sell coffee at a temperature the 
company knew could cause burns. Evidence showed McDonald's coffee was hotter 
than that served at other restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in Albuquerque. According to our admittedly unscientific survey, at 
least one Burger King and one Starbucks outlet serve coffee hotter than 
McDonald's. We found temperatures ranging from a low of 157 degrees at Primo's, 
a small chain of coffee shops, to a high of 182 degrees at one Downtown Los 
Angeles Burger King.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Albuquerque case, it was disclosed that McDonald's brews coffee at 195 
to 205 degrees and holds it at 180 to 190 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 If you conduct this temperature test at home, you may find similar results 
with your own coffee. According to the Assn. of Home Appliances Manufacturers, 
brewing temperatures for coffee makers range from 170 to 205 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee industry is loath to turn down the heat, despite potential 
liability for burns. The Specialty Coffee Assn., whose members include coffee 
roasters, retailers and restaurants, says coffee tastes best if brewed at 195 
to 205 degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 Ted Lingel, executive director of the association, said members are discussing 
other safety measures, such as printing warnings on cups--already a practice at 
McDonald's--and using spill-proof lids. 
</P>

 Getting exercised: Bally's decision to reduce operating hours at many of its 
47 health clubs in the Los Angeles area a few weeks ago touched off a revolt 
among hundreds of members. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Abrahamson, who led a petition drive at a Rosemead gym owned by Bally's 
Health & Tennis Corp., complained that opening the club half an hour later in 
the morning left him too little time to exercise before work. He said the 
opening time at his club was moved to 5:30 a.m. from 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to work out a couple body parts every day," he said. "Now I can't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bally's has been accused of trampling on club members in the past. In April, 
it paid $120,000 to settle federal allegations of deceptive billing, membership 
cancellation and refund practices. Two months earlier, it paid the Los Angeles 
district attorney's office $138,062 to settle false-advertising charges in 
connection with a membership promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bally's did not admit wrongdoing in either case. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it has the right to change operating times--a move it is 
taking to standardize operations nationwide. In Los Angeles, no club had hours 
shortened by more than 60 minutes, a spokeswoman for Bally's said. The actual 
hours vary according to club size. While all the company's clubs now open at 
5:30 a.m., the larger clubs close later in the evening, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman said Bally's received 559 complaints about the changes.  
</P>

 Call them mini-billboards: More and more advertisers looking for ways to reach 
children are splashing their names on milk caps--cardboard disks commonly 
called POGs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Lee Corp. includes a free milk cap bearing the company name in boxes of 
English muffins. Nordstrom gave away 70,000 caps to promote its junior clothing 
department last year. Del Taco, Burger King and Disneyland ran similar milk cap 
giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year or so, the milk caps have become wildly popular among 
school-age children. They have even been banned from some elementary schools as 
distractions. Kids stack POGs and knock them over in a game that is a cross 
between tiddlywinks and baseball card flipping. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for a leading POG manufacturer makes no apologies for turning milk 
caps into ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, when a kid is at home, they always see in front of them the 
Nordstrom name" or whatever name is on the cap, said Brian Theriot, spokesman 
for the Costa Mesa-based World POG Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Theriot said his company has set certain standards for advertising, but he 
said he couldn't be specific: "Let's just say that we won't put anything on a 
cap that Mom or Dad or Grandma doesn't approve of." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Waste not the not wanted: Fenton Communications, a Washington public relations 
firm, provides a self-addressed envelope for people to return unwanted 
mailings. "We'll be able to send them to someone else and avoid the 
environmental impact of additional paper, printing and production costs," a 
note says. No word on what they'll do if all mailings are returned. Some Like 
It Hot

 A random survey shows McDonald's isn't the only chain offering hot coffee.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; BLOCKBUSTER MAY LOSE HUIZENGA UNDER VIACOM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Blockbuster Entertainment seemingly headed for acquisition by Viacom 
Inc., what happens to the management team that built Blockbuster into the 
nation's biggest video rental chain? 
</P>
<P>
 Documents recently filed by Viacom show that the company intends to offer 
three-year employment agreements to all of Blockbuster's officers and to 
"certain other members of its management."But Blockbuster Chief Executive H. 
Wayne Huizenga, who is scheduled to be vice chairman of the combined company, 
may not be around for long. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the documents, Huizenga "will continue as a member of the 
combined company's senior management for an appropriate transition period 
following the completion of the merger," suggesting that he plans to depart 
once things settle down. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Huizenga needs a job. His net worth has been estimated at nearly $700 
million. He also owns three of the four major sports teams in the Miami area 
and wants to build a huge new sports and entertainment complex there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Viacom Productions named Adene Lacy vice president, finance and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hanna-Barbera Cartoons named several executives to new positions. Ilene 
Hoffman is director of development, motion pictures; Alan Keith was named 
controller; Joe Mazzuca is vice president, TV production management; 
Christopher Glennon is director of studio operation, and Bill Dennis is general 
manager for the company's Fil-Cartoons.

COMPANY TOWN; WRITERS GUILD WEST OPENS UP TO AUTHORS OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA; 
LABOR: HISTORIC MOVE UNDERSCORES THE UNION'S COMMITMENT TO SEEKING NEW CREATIVE 
OUTLETS FOR ITS MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a break with tradition that may clear the way for teen-age computer hackers 
to join the ranks of Hollywood's elite screenwriters, the Writers Guild of 
America West has opened its doors to writer-designers of interactive multimedia 
computer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Santa Barbara-based husband-and-wife team of Tony and Meryl 
Perutz, who wrote Electronic Arts' new "Around the World in Eighty Days," and 
Michele Em of Sierra Madre, author of the best-selling "Return to Zork," became 
the first writers to gain admission to the guild solely for scripting CD-ROM 
software titles under its newly devised interactive contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, to become a member, a writer had to work for a TV or movie company 
that had signed the guild's 400-page collective bargaining agreement regulating 
compensation, terms of employment and revenues from such markets as home video, 
foreign TV and merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an incredible experience, learning to write non-linear stories," 
says Tony Perutz, a former program executive who helped devise Warner 
Communications Inc.'s first interactive TV experiment in the mid-1970s. "It's 
exciting to see that this new field has been accepted by the creative 
community," added Meryl Perutz. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic move -- prompted by the staggering profit potential of the 
in-home electronic games industry -- underscores the WGAW's commitment to 
developing ties with Silicon Valley, and its intent to exploit the coming age 
of interactive media on behalf of its 7,600 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our studies indicate that, at any one point in time, over half of our members 
are not working, so we see this as a great source of employment and new 
creative and business opportunities," says Joel Block, the guild's director of 
industry alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild and the American 
Federation of Television and Radio Actors have similar agendas, and all three 
report that a growing number of software publishers are starting to hire their 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 With CD-ROM technology now within the economic reach of a growing number of 
consumers, retail sales of CD-ROM software are expected to hit $2.1 billion 
this year, up 40% from $1.5 billion in 1993. Conservative estimates see annual 
retail sales of $15 billion five years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to lobbying software publishers to hire guild writers, the WGAW is 
educating its members in interactive technologies. It has also become a fixture 
at digital trade shows and produces an interactive multimedia writers 
directory. 
</P>
<P>
 But, most significantly, while business parameters for the software industry 
are still being drawn, the guild has replaced its massive collective bargaining 
agreement with a flexible, one-page interactive media contract. The new pact 
allows the parties to freely negotiate terms of compensation -- requiring only 
that software publishers contribute a total of 12.5% of a writer's total 
compensation to the guild's pension and health funds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the "get acquainted" honeymoon is over, a heated debate may 
emerge over gross royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Isgur, a media analyst and managing director at Jefferies & Co., says that 
Acclaim Entertainment's "Mortal Kombat II," shipped last week, will probably 
sell 4 million to 10 million units worldwide over the next 12 months at an 
average wholesale price of $40. "So we're talking about $160 million to $400 
million," he says. "Everyone wants a piece of that action, and that's what 
they'll be fighting for." 
</P>
<P>
 While few precedents exist for compensating writers of interactive media -- 
fees can range from $25,000 to $100,000 for a 500-page script or "design 
document" -- guild negotiators suggest the precedent for royalty payments 
already exists in the software industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tradition of rewarding authors of software with gross-based 
royalty compensation packages, and we believe the writer should share in the 
success of the product," said Block of the WGAW. "This shouldn't have to be 
fought over every deal -- it should be cemented into the business practices of 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 However, media analyst Isgur calls that notion "ludicrous." "It's like saying, 
'If I buy a Bill Blass suit, every time I wear it, I should pay a rental fee,' 
" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 companies, including Knowledge Adventure, Philips Interactive Media 
of America and Interfilm Technologies, have used the interactive agreement to 
hire guild writers. So far, the outlook seems positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "On 'Wing Commander III,' our in-house multimedia writers turned out a script 
that wasn't good enough, so we went with two guild writers -- Terry Borst and 
Frank de Palma," says Bing Gordon, executive vice president at Electronic Arts 
Studios. "The result was we started with a script that nobody liked and ended 
up with a script that everybody liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has embraced new media. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our writers -- particularly those with experience -- are resisting 
the whole idea of interactive storytelling," said former WGAW President Del 
Reisman. "What they're saying is: 'We don't want you at home to have choices 
about the ending or anything else. We're the writers and we prefer to tell the 
stories.' "

 * Books: Warner Books plans to develop some novel ideas with New World 
Entertainment Chairman Brandon Tartikoff. The former Paramount Pictures 
chairman and NBC Entertainment chief signed a unique deal to develop at least 
three novels for Warner Books over the next two years that have film or TV 
potential.First up will be R.L. Stine's "Superstition," the author's first 
adult hardcover horror work. All of the publications will say "A Brandon 
Tartikoff Book" and will be published initially in hardcover, followed by 
paperback versions. The deal was brokered by Robert Gottlieb, an executive vice 
president at the William Morris Agency. In a statement Tartikoff described his 
goal as "to nurture high-concept, top-quality material that can begin life as 
hardcover literary works and then be developed into compelling properties for 
film, television and the emerging new media." Tartikoff recently developed the 
conception for "Trophies," a novel expected to be published by Warner Books in 
late 1995. Producer Joel Silver is expected to develop it as a feature film for 
Warner Bros. JAMES BATES

SEN. PEACE PLANS LEGISLATION TO PULL THE PLUG ON THE PUC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enough of the Public Utilities Commission, already. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as state Sen. Steve Peace (D-Bonita) is concerned, the PUC has outlived 
its usefulness and is "way beyond reclamation." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace's solution? He said Thursday that he plans in January to propose an 
amendment to the state constitution that would abolish the 83-year-old agency, 
responsible for regulating the state's utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, he said, is to initiate discussion about what sort of oversight 
should replace the current system, given the vast shifts in telecommunications 
and energy. "The best way . . . is to build the mousetrap from scratch," he 
said. Any ideas for what a new system might be? "Yes," Peace added, "but I try 
to suppress them. I don't want to bias the discussion." MARTHA GROVES

MEDCHEM PRODUCTS BIDS TO BUY LUTHER MEDICAL; MERGER: ANALYSTS SAY THE $9.8 
MILLION TO $11.2 MILLION TAKEOVER OFFER, WHICH HAS BEEN LABELED AS 'FRIENDLY,' 
MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR THE FINANCIALLY TROUBLED TUSTIN COMPANY. 
</P>

<P>
 A Massachusetts-based medical products company has made an unsolicited bid to 
acquire Luther Medical Products in Tustin for up to $11.2 million, the 
companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 MedChem Products Inc. in Woburn, Mass., has offered between $3.50 and $4 per 
share, or between $9.8 million and $11.2 million, for Luther's 2.8-million 
outstanding shares. MedChem said that the deal might include a combination of 
cash and MedChem stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Luther Medical, which closed up 35 cents Thursday to $3.25 in Nasdaq 
trading, had traded for as much as $10 in 1992. However, its stock has been 
hovering under $4 since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther's board of directors will review MedChem's offer during an upcoming 
board meeting, said David Rollo, Luther president and chief executive officer. 
MedChem's president and chief executive officer, Ed Quilty, characterized 
Tuesday's offer as "friendly," but said that no direct discussions occurred 
before the offer was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther's catheter business has "natural synergies" with MedChem's Gesco Inc. 
subsidiary based in San Antonio, Tex., a catheter business that generates about 
40% of MedChem revenue. Gesco reported a $7.6-million net profit on $32 million 
in revenue for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31. MedChem acquired Gesco two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollo said that "while the suggested range in MedChem's proposal represents a 
premium over Luther's current trading price . . . we must balance this against 
the longer term values that Luther Medical may be capable of achieving." 
</P>
<P>
 MedChem's bid, Rollo said, suggests "that some of Luther Medical's recent 
successes in the market place and in receiving FDA approvals have not escaped 
the notice of our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said the deal might make sense for financially troubled 
Luther, which reported a $286,664 net loss on $679,197 in revenue for the third 
quarter ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, we're not extremely impressed with most of the mergers that occur," 
said David Anast, publisher of the Costa Mesa-based Biomedical Market 
Newsletter. "But given Luther's history of financial difficulties, it would 
appear to be a win-win situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luther's got to have major league distribution for its products if it's ever 
to dig itself out of the hole it's in," Anast said. "And this deal would appear 
to have the potential to help it grow much larger." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the health care business in general, these types of 
affiliations increasingly make sense," said Quilty, a former executive at McGaw 
Inc., a manufacturer of intravenous solutions in Irvine. "It will be really 
hard for small companies in the future to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Quilty declined to say whether MedChem would consolidate Luther and Gesco in 
Texas if a deal is completed. "At this point I don't think we know enough about 
it to comment on that aspect," Quilty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther, with 41 employees at its headquarters in Tustin, designs, manufactures 
and markets catheter systems. Ron Luther, its founder and chairman, is believed 
to hold more patents related to catheter technology than does any other 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 The company recently won Food and Drug Administration approval to market a 
new, Teflon-covered catheter. The product was the third Luther device approved 
by the FDA since April. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilty said he views Ron Luther as "a significant asset for the company. . . . 
He holds more patents than anyone else in the industry. I've known of Ron 
Luther for years." 
</P>
<P>
 MedChem, which has 150 employees, saw its shares close at $6.35, up 25 cents 
Thursday in New York Stock Exchange trading. MedChem-Luther: Proposed Merger 
</P>
<P>
 Luther Medical, a Tustin-based medical products company, has received a 
purchase offer, valued between $9.8 million and $11.2 million, from MedChem 
Products, a Massachusetts-based competitor. Details on the two companies: 
</P>
<P>
 Luther Medical * Headquarters: Tustin * Founder/chairman: Ron Luther * 
Products: Intravascular catheter systems and neuro-diagnostic products * 
Employees: 41 * Nasdaq: LUTH 
</P>

 MedChem Products * Headquarters: Woburn, Mass. * Chairman: Dr. James F. Martin 
* Products: Specialty medical products, including intravascular catheters and 
topical hemostats * Employees: 150 * NYSE: MCH Stock Shows Improvement 
</P>
<P>
 Luther's stock closed up after MedChem's purchase offer of $3.50-$4 per share. 
The stock had been trading in the $3 neighborhood or lower for several months.

BRIEFCASE: LABOR; HUGHES SEVERANCE PACKAGE FOR WORKERS NOT NEARLY AS GENEROUS 
AS THE LAST ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hughes Aircraft workers who get pink slips won't be leaving empty-handed, but 
they won't be getting nearly as generous a severance package as their 
predecessors got two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing this week the shutdown of its Fullerton plant by the end of 
1995, Hughes said an estimated 800 to 1,000 of the 6,800 workers there would be 
laid off. The first wave of pink slips is due in about six weeks. Most of the 
other workers will be transferred to El Segundo and Long Beach, with some also 
going to Tucson and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who are laid off, the company said it will provide 60% of their 
salary for four to 12 weeks, depending on length of service. That's the 
equivalent of two and a half to seven weeks of full pay. Laid-off workers also 
will also receive company-paid health coverage for three months and up to 
$1,000 in tuition reimbursement. Additional federal and state training funds 
will also be available for Hughes workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this severance package falls short of the unusually liberal package 
Hughes provided the 12,000 workers it laid off in 1992 and 1993. Those workers 
got up to 40 weeks of severance pay, plus six months of company-paid health 
coverage and up to $5,000 in tuition reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the money to fund it like before," said Hughes spokesman 
Richard Dore, noting that the company took a charge of $750 million related to 
the 1992-93 layoffs and restructuring. This time around, Hughes did not report 
any major expense for the companywide layoff of 4,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dore said that the new severance package is still far more generous than other 
aerospace companies -- some of which don't give any severance pay at all. And 
Hughes will give its workers eight weeks' notice before laying them off. 
</P>
<P>
 The new severance package will apply retroactively to Jan. 1, meaning Hughes 
employees who were laid off earlier this year will be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's one other benefit for everyone as well, Dore said: "We're going to 
see if there are job opportunities" for laid-off workers in other divisions of 
General Motors, Hughes' parent company.

 Union to Renegotiate Package: The severance package remains an open issue, 
however, for the thousand or so union workers at Hughes in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: In 1992, Hughes workers represented by the Carpenters Union voted 
down the severance package offered then, opting instead to take a higher 
company-paid matching contribution to their 401(k) savings plans. "That was a 
big mistake," said one former union steward. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that vote in 1992, the Carpenters Union must now negotiate a severance 
package for its members. The union's contract with Hughes expires in early 
November.

 Sam's Club to Vote: The National Labor Relations Board has set Oct. 7 as the 
date when about 150 workers at Sam's Club in Fullerton will vote on whether 
they want to be represented by Teamsters Local 952. 
</P>
<P>
 If a majority of these warehouse and clerical workers cast ballots for the 
Teamsters, it will mark the first store owned by discount giant Wal-Mart to 
become unionized.The Arkansas-based retailer operates 430 Sam's Club warehouses 
and some 2,300 Wal-Mart stores in the country, but not a single one is under a 
union contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange-based Teamsters Local 952 filed for a union election in late July after 
months of organizing. At that time, the union said it had signatures of support 
from the majority of the workers at the Fullerton store. But the election will 
tell whether that support has held steady or waned.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: DIP IN MICROSEMI INVENTORY VALUE LEADS TO CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsemi Corp. said it will record an $8-million to $10-million charge in its 
fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of military-related inventories and 
other assets where there has been a permanent reduction of value. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsemi said substantially all the charges result directly from changes in 
military procurement policies and practices that call for the use of commercial 
products rather than a mandatory use of military standard parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported net income of $950,000, or 12 cents a share, on sales of 
$29,830,000 in the year-ago fourth quarter ended Oct. 3, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsemi said uncertainties caused by the Department of Defense's changes in 
defense procurement policy make it necessary to revalue certain inventories to 
current market value.

STEELY DAN'S BECKER BY HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were elusive titans, hunkering down in studios to turn out pop songs with 
liberal references to the languages of jazz and literature. Donald Fagen and 
Walter Becker, twin architects of the '70s super-group Steely Dan, rarely 
surfaced in much of a public way. Mystique and inaccessibility only served to 
enhance their legend, without damaging their commercial potential. They were 
heroes in the dark, invisible pop stars. 
</P>
<P>
 That was then, this is now. The main reason that Becker is sitting in the 
sheer daylight of a seaside hotel in Santa Monica is to talk to the press about 
his own recent milestone, the release of his debut solo album, "11 Tracks of 
Whack" on Giant records. He has sent his son, Kawaii, off to a movie with a 
friend, has settled down on a couch in his suite and is as affable and lucid as 
can be. The dark ages, it seems, are over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the Dan split up in 1980, Becker headed to Hawaii to clean up his life 
and start a family before easing back into music as a producer. Fagen headed 
Back East and sat out much of the '80s, finally surfacing with last year's solo 
album, "Kamakiriad." Steely Dan had been all but relegated to the annals of 
classic rock and fond collective memory. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed a year ago when an expanded incarnation of Steely Dan 
embarked on a successful tour. One good tour deserves another; Becker, Fagen 
and company are on the road again and will be at Irvine Meadows tonight and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no simple case of comeback fever, of grabbing a chance to cash in on a 
nostalgia-driven market. For this notoriously studio-bound group, the stage was 
an alien place, and most of the songs the band is playing had never been heard 
live before. It has been, in essence, a kind of virgin voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time we'd ever heard a band play these songs was the day we laid the 
track," Becker said. Touring last year "was a very exciting thing. A big part 
of the excitement was the way the audience was reacting. They were so eager to 
hear these songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were guys in the band, Peter Erskine and others, who obviously have 
played for huge audiences all the time, and even they, I felt, sensed the 
intensity of focus the audience put into the shows. It made the experience 
striking and special for them. That's why we're going to do it some more. It 
was so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Steely Dan fans may or may not be disarmed by Becker's solo project. "Whack" 
is full of musical designs that are simpler and more rock-oriented than Fagen's 
work but still offer lots of quirky musical twists. Not surprisingly, there are 
plenty of wry references to life on the edge, a place Becker has visited at 
length. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With an album so full of cryptic touches and murky connections, questions 
inevitably arise. For instance: Where does that title come from? 
</P>
<P>
 Becker answered the question patiently; he already had heard it more than once 
that day, and he knew he'd be hearing it again. He said the key word stuck in 
his brain after he read about John Gotti, whose definition of "whack" has 
nothing to do with ironic songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up with that title when I realized that a lot of the songs I wrote 
were not motivated by my love of my fellow man. As much as anything else, they 
rank on people or are lashing out or, in some cases, are about people who are 
dead. So I got into this 'whack' idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the album on an uncharacteristically upbeat and non-whacky note is the 
cowpoke waltz "Little Kawaii," dedicated to his son. "For somebody like me to 
write and record and put on the album a song like that," Becker noted with a 
smile, "is a bit of a new phase." 
</P>
<P>
 A newfound innocence? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right," he laughed at the thought. "A newfound innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he said, when he began the project he was dealing with happier notes 
than those he ended up with. But he found he "had too many songs with a strong 
major tonality. Having that many songs and having too many of them be major, I 
thought, was a little bit obnoxious. I had to leave out a few of the real 
cornerstones of the domestic bliss picture -- although even those cornerstones 
were cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless, it did come out seeming perhaps a little bit darker than it 
might have. The picture got a little skewed toward the other side. I intend to 
remedy that in the future. I have some bliss left over, which I'll be 
presenting shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 The album marks the first time Becker's voice has been heard singing upfront 
and at length and also presents the first examples of his songwriting without 
his partner (Fagen has released two albums of his own songs: "Kamakiriad" and 
1982's "The Nightfly"). 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great freedom in writing by yourself," Becker discovered. "You can 
write anything you want. When you're collaborating with somebody, there has to 
be a spirit of cooperation. There are a lot of times when you just can't 
persuade someone to write a certain type of song, either musically or 
lyrically. So I grew to enjoy it for that, because I could write very simple 
songs or offbeat lyrics or do pretty much anything I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 His primary ally in the songwriting process turned out to be his computer. "It 
got to be a very creative process where you could quickly capture any fleeting 
idea that you had and then edit it up into some kind of finished form. 
Computers change the way writing text goes. If you're typing and are going to 
have to retype the whole page, you'll be more careful with what you do and more 
deliberate. You'll have a whole sentence in your mind before you start or 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same thing turned out to be the case with the computer musically. It 
allowed me to be very intuitive and free about it, and then I could just edit 
out the garbage or edit the good stuff together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the memorable, and peculiar, songs on "11 Tracks of Whack" is 
"Girlfriend." Becker uses the verses to ramble in an almost free associative 
way, punctuating his discourse with allusions to TV ("there was a time in my 
life when one aspect of my lifestyle called for watching a lot of television," 
he said with a grin). Along comes the chorus, an infectious R&B haiku extolling 
the virtues of a romantic foil. There lies the basic Steely Dan paradox: pop 
music that is at once arcane and hooky. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker and Fagen entered the business as pop songwriters for Jay and the 
Americans and others before launching their band, which they named after a 
William Burroughs term for a marital aid. From the start, they clearly were 
strange bedfellows with the pop Establishment. And although their meticulously 
crafted and increasingly sophisticated albums managed to enjoy both commercial 
and critical success, Becker said "the only time I ever really remember being 
thrilled by hearing something on the radio was the very first time. When the 
first album came out and I heard 'Do It Again' on the radio, that was the 
greatest thing that had ever happened. After that, it was all downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 As the band amassed its revered body of work through the '70s, Becker the 
guitar player began to emerge more and more. His minimalistic attack at the end 
of "FM" and the signature solo on "Josie" were heard anywhere hits were played. 
His style, which shows up amply on his new album, could be called lanky and 
languid, squirming between jazz, blues and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donald wanted me to play guitar because he felt that we'd end up with 
something weirder and more interesting if I did it. A lot of times, we'd get 
somebody to come in and try something and we'd listen to it, and it would be 
too ordinary or (the guitarist) wouldn't understand it in any unusual tonal 
way. That was the problem we had a lot of time back then. The guys who had the 
kind of sound and technique that we wanted on guitar didn't understand some of 
the tonalities we were working with. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I understood what I thought could happen, and that it was important 
to land on that unlikely note, a note outside the chord or scale. I had that 
going for me." 
</P>
<P>
 One strong contribution to the pop tradition made by the band was its careful 
way of weaving complex instrumental solos and passages into otherwise 
pop-friendly settings. Live, they continue to give generous improvisational 
leeway to their musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that in the context of the times, most of the solo playing you heard 
was long, indulgent soloing over not very interesting chord changes or not very 
concise frameworks. We had the idea of getting a maximally exciting, striking 
solo in a condensed, designed-for-the-purpose little chunk of music. In some 
cases, it was just a piece of the song, but in a lot of the cases it was a 
specially-written section, as was the case in 'Kid Charlemagne.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So a lot of these things were already set up (in such a way) that they would 
help propel a guy into playing something good and have a built-in structural 
strength. We thought those parts should be just as good and hooky as the other 
parts of the song."

 Having successfully re-emerged both as a solo artist and in a reaffirmed 
connection with his old cohort, Becker seems to have his life in a healthy 
perspective. His is a not-atypical saga of the entertainment figure succumbing 
to debauchery and excess, only to escape and eventually mend his ways. One half 
expects Becker to shrug it all off as a personal case of 
life-as-tawdry-literature. But he is earnest and expansive on the subject of 
his long trek back to the business of making music.

 His fall from grace, he said, began after the release of Steely Dan's last 
album, "Gaucho." 
</P>
<P>
 "Making 'Gaucho' was an extremely painful process, as a recording. By the time 
it was finished, because of that and because of various personal things that 
were going on in my life -- and probably in Donald's, too -- we were ready to 
do something else besides working with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at a point where I could either continue on the path I was going on, 
but not for very long," he said with a laugh, "or I could make an abrupt change 
of course and perhaps persist a little bit longer. That's what I decided to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with a lot of people who are drug abusers, one of the problems they 
have is that they feel like they never get enough. No matter how much they get, 
they never feel as though they've had enough of it and have seen this thing 
through and are satisfied with it. And I was. I had had all I wanted, and I was 
through with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to the point where there was no doubt in my mind that this was never 
going anywhere. So I moved to Hawaii and stopped smoking, stopped drinking and 
stopped taking all kinds of drugs. Lo and behold, as I came out of all of that, 
I found this whole other world to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donald and I spent most of our time in studios, or in little dark rooms, in 
New York or Los Angeles writing songs. In Hawaii, here was this big blast of 
light hitting, the outside world and the sparkling bejeweled light of the 
Pacific. I was completely fascinated with that for years, and I didn't feel any 
need to do anything. Musically, I played the guitar a little bit, but that was 
it, basically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another thing is, when you have those kinds of transitions in your life, when 
you stop those kinds of addictions, it's very useful to be in a different 
place, to sever your ties with the things that you associate with those things. 
It was helpful to be in a completely different setting and function in a 
completely different way, thinking of myself as not being part of this team, 
whose sole purpose in life was to make records, but to think of myself in more 
of a human kind of way."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; RETIRED OFFICER FOILS CARJACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 An attempted Simi Valley carjacking was foiled when a retired police 
lieutenant chased the thieves and dodged gunfire before recovering his son's 
pickup truck, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lafferty, 49, chased the carjackers after they followed his 21-year-old 
son, Brian, to his parents' Simi Valley home Wednesday night and forced him at 
gunpoint to surrender his truck keys, Brian Lafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Lafferty said the two men who confronted him and his 18-year-old 
girlfriend in his garage fled in his pickup, joining a second car with perhaps 
two other suspects in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lafferty, who retired in 1987 after nearly 20 years with the Los 
Angeles Police Department, gave chase in his car after hearing of the robbery 
while his son called police, Brian Lafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the elder Lafferty followed the two vehicles onto the Simi Valley 
Freeway, the car pulled alongside and a gunman leaned out the window and fired 
several shots, Brian Lafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his father fell back but stayed on their tail. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the freeway at Kuehner Drive, the pickup ran into a curb and the 
suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled, apparently on foot, Simi Police Sgt. 
Mike King said. Neither they nor the other vehicle were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Lafferty, who last served as a lieutenant at the LAPD's Valley Traffic 
Division, could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, who says he has been accepted to the Rio Hondo Police Academy in 
Whittier, said, "It's stuff like this that makes me really want to do it, to 
make people that do crimes like this pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second carjacking this year in Simi Valley, Sgt. King said. GREG
